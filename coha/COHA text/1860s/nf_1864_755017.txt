txt //e to the illustration of the period in question , whether in the form of chronicle , memoir , private correspondence , legal codes , or official documents . Among these are various contemporary manuscripts , covering the whole ground of the narrative , none of which have been printed , and some of them but little known to Spanish scholars . In obtaining copies of these from the public libraries , I must add , that I have found facilities under the present liberal government , which were denied me under the preceding . In addition to these sources of information , I have availed myself , in the part of the work occupied with literary criticism and history , of the library of my friend , Mr. George Ticknor , who during a visit to Spain , some years since , collected whatever was rare and valuable in the literature of the Peninsula . I must further acknowledge my obligations to the library of Harvard University , in Cambridge , from whose rich repository of books relating to our own country I have derived material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to notice the favors of another kind for which I am indebted to my friend , Mr. William H. Gardiner , whose judicious counsels have been of essential benefit to me in the revision of my labors . In the plan of the work , I have not limited myself to a strict chronological narrative of passing events , but have occasionally paused , at the expense , perhaps , of some interest in the story , to seek such collateral information as might bring these events into a clearer view . I have devoted a liberal portion of the work to the literary progress of the nation , conceiving this quite as essential a part of its history as civil and military details . I have occasionally introduced , at the close of the chapters , a critical notice of the authorities used , that the reader may form some estimate of their comparative value and credibility . Finally , I have endeavored to present him with such an account of the state of affairs , both before the accession , and at the demise of the Catholic sovereigns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveying the entire results of their reign . How far I have succeeded in the execution of this plan , must be left to the reader 's candid judgment . Many errors he may be able to detect . Sure I am , there can be no one more sensible of my deficiencies than myself ; although it was not till after practical experience , that I could fully estimate the difficulty of obtaining anything like a faithful portraiture of a distant age , amidst the shifting hues and perplexing cross lights of historic testimony . From one class of errors my subject necessarily exempts me ; those founded on national or party feeling . I may have been more open to another fault ; that of too strong a bias in favor of my principal actors ; for characters , noble and interesting in themselves , naturally beget a sort of partiality akin to friendship , in the historian 's mind , accustomed to the daily contemplation of them . Whatever defects may be charged on the work , I can at least assure myself , that it is an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reader in an English dress , and resting on a solid basis of authentic materials , such as probably could not be met with out of Spain , nor in it without much difficulty . I hope I shall be acquitted of egotism , although I add a few words respecting the peculiar embarrassments I have encountered , in composing these volumes . Soon after my arrangements were made , early in 1826 , for obtaining the necessary materials from Madrid , I was deprived of the use of my eyes for all purposes of reading and writing , and had no prospect of again recovering it . This was a serious obstacle to the prosecution of a work requiring the perusal of a large mass of authorities , in various languages , the contents of which were to be carefully collated , and transferred to my own pages , verified by minute reference . 2 Thus shut out from one sense , I was driven to rely exclusively on another , and to make the ear do the work of the eye . With the assistance of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any modern language but his own , I worked my way through several venerable Castilian quartos , until I was satisfied of the practicability of the undertaking . I next procured the services of one more competent to aid me in pursuing my historical inquiries . The process was slow and irksome enough , doubtless , to both parties , at least till my ear was accommodated to foreign sounds , and an antiquated , oftentimes barbarous phraseology , when my progress became more sensible , and I was cheered with the prospect of success . It certainly would have been a far more serious misfortune , to be led thus blindfold through the pleasant paths of literature ; but my track stretched , for the most part , across dreary wastes , where no beauty lurked , to arrest the traveller 's eye and charm his senses . After persevering in this course for some years , my eyes , by the blessing of Providence , recovered sufficient strength to allow me to use them , with tolerable freedom , in the prosecution of my labors , and in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be misunderstood , as stating these circumstances to deprecate the severity of criticism , since I am inclined to think the greater circumspection I have been compelled to use has left me , on the whole , less exposed to inaccuracies , than I should have been in the ordinary mode of composition . But , as I reflect on the many sober hours I have passed in wading through black letter tomes , and through manuscripts whose doubtful orthography and defiance of all punctuation were so many stumbling-blocks to my amanuensis , it calls up a scene of whimsical distresses , not usually encountered , on which the good-natured reader may , perhaps , allow I have some right , now that I have got the better of them , to dwell with satisfaction . I will only remark , in conclusion of this too prolix discussion about myself , that while making my tortoise-like progress , I saw what I had fondly looked upon as my own ground , ( having indeed lain unmolested by any other invader for so many ages , ) suddenly entered , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I allude to Mr. Irving 's " History of Columbus , " and " Chronicle of Granada ; " the subjects of which , although covering but a small part of my whole plan , form certainly two of its most brilliant portions . Now , alas ! if not devoid of interest , they are , at least , stripped of the charm of novelty . For what eye has not been attracted to the spot on which the light of that writer 's genius has fallen ? I can not quit the subject which has so long occupied me , without one glance at the present unhappy condition of Spain ; who , shorn of her ancient splendor , humbled by the loss of empire abroad , and credit at home , is abandoned to all the evils of anarchy . Yet , deplorable as this condition is , it is not so bad as the lethargy in which she has been sunk for ages . Better be hurried forward for a season on the wings of the tempest , than stagnate in a deathlike calm , fatal alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution , when old things are passing away , and new ones are not yet established , is , indeed , fearful . Even the immediate consequences of its achievement are scarcely less so to a people who have yet to learn by experiment the precise form of institutions best suited to their wants , and to accommodate their character to these institutions . Such results must come with time , however , if the nation be but true to itself . And that they will come , sooner or later , to the Spaniards , surely no one can distrust who is at all conversant with their earlier history , and has witnessed the examples it affords of heroic virtue , devoted patriotism , and generous love of freedom ; " Che l'antico valore  --   --  non e ancor morto . " Clouds and darkness have , indeed , settled thick around the throne of the youthful Isabella ; but not a deeper darkness than that which covered the land in the first years of her illustrious namesake ; and we may humbly trust , that the same Providence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may carry the nation safe through its present perils , and secure to it the greatest of earthly blessings , civil and religious liberty . November , 1837 . FOOTNOTES 1 The only histories of this reign by continental writers , with which I am acquainted , are the " Histoire des Rois Catholiques Ferdinand et Isabelle , par l'Abbe Mignot , Paris , 1766 , " and the " Geschichte der Regierung Ferdinand des Katholischen , von Rupert Becker , Prag und Leipzig , 1790 . " Their authors have employed the most accessible materials only in the compilation ; and , indeed , they lay claim to no great research , which would seem to be precluded by the extent of their works , in neither instance exceeding two volumes duodecimo . They have the merit of exhibiting , in a simple , perspicuous form , those events , which , lying on the surface , may be found more or less expanded in moat general histories . 2 " To compile a history from various authors , when they can only be consulted by other eyes , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attentive help than can be commonly obtained .

PREFACE TO THE THIRD ENGLISH EDITION . Since the publication of the First Edition of this work , it has undergone a careful revision ; and this , aided by the communications of several intelligent friends , who have taken an interest in its success , has enabled me to correct several verbal inaccuracies , and a few typographical errors , which had been previously overlooked . While the Second Edition was passing through the press , I received , also , copies of two valuable Spanish works , having relation to the reign of the Catholic sovereigns , but which , as they appeared during the recent troubles of the Peninsula , had not before come to my knowledge . For these I am indebted to the politeness of Don Angel Calderon de la Barca , late Spanish Minister at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , personal accomplishments , and independent conduct in public life , have secured for him deservedly high consideration in the United States , as well as in his own country . I must still further acknowledge my obligation to Don Pascual de Gayangos , the learned author of the " Mahommedan Dynasties in Spain , " recently published in London ,  --  a work , which , from its thorough investigation of original sources , and fine spirit of criticism , must supply , what has been so long felt as an important desideratum with the student ,  --  the means of forming a perfect acquaintance with the Arabian portion of the Peninsular annals . There fell into the hands of this gentleman , on the breaking up of the convents of Saragossa in 1835 , a rich collection of original documents , comprehending , among other things , the autograph correspondence of Ferdinand and Isabella , and of the principal persons of their court . It formed , probably , part of the library of Geronimo Zurita ,  --  historiographer of Aragon , under Philip the Second ,  --  who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever documents could illustrate the history of the country . This rare collection was left at his death to a monastery in his native city . Although Zurita is one of the principal authorities for the present work , there are many details of interest in this correspondence , which have passed unnoticed by him , although forming the basis of his conclusions ; and I have gladly availed myself of the liberality and great kindness of Senor de Gayangos , who has placed these manuscripts at my disposal , transcribing such as I have selected , for the corroboration and further illustration of my work . The difficulties attending this labor of love will be better appreciated , when it is understood , that the original writing is in an antiquated character , which few Spanish scholars of the present day could comprehend , and often in cipher , which requires much patience and ingenuity to explain . With these various emendations , it is hoped that the present Edition may be found more deserving of that favor from the public , which has been so courteously accorded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ INTRODUCTION .

For several hundred years after the great Saracen invasion in the beginning of the eighth century , Spain was broken up into a number of small but independent states , divided in their interests , and often in deadly hostility with one another . It was inhabited by races , the most dissimilar in their origin , religion , and government , the least important of which has exerted a sensible influence on the character and institutions of its present inhabitants . At the close of the fifteenth century , these various races were blended into one great nation , under one common rule . Its territorial limits were widely extended by discovery and conquest . Its domestic institutions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , to a considerable extent , they have maintained to the present day . It is the object of the present narrative to exhibit the period in which these momentous results were effected ,  --  the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella . By the middle of the fifteenth century , the number of states , into which the country had been divided , was reduced to four ; Castile , Aragon , Navarre , and the Moorish kingdom of Granada . The last , comprised within nearly the same limits as the modern province of that name , was all that remained to the Moslems of their once vast possessions in the Peninsula . Its concentrated population gave it a degree of strength altogether disproportioned to the extent of its territory ; and the profuse magnificence of its court , which rivalled that of the ancient caliphs , was supported by the labors of a sober , industrious people , under whom agriculture and several of the mechanic arts had reached a degree of excellence , probably unequalled in any other part of Europe during the Middle Ages . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had often attracted the avarice of neighboring and more powerful states . But , since their selfish schemes operated as a mutual check upon each other , Navarre still continued to maintain her independence , when all the smaller states in the Peninsula had been absorbed in the gradually increasing dominion of Castile and Aragon . This latter kingdom comprehended the province of that name , together with Catalonia and Valencia . Under its auspicious climate and free political institutions , its inhabitants displayed an uncommon share of intellectual and moral energy . Its long line of coast opened the way to an extensive and flourishing commerce ; and its enterprising navy indemnified the nation for the scantiness of its territory at home , by the important foreign conquests of Sardinia , Sicily , Naples , and the Balearic Isles . The remaining provinces of Leon , Biscay , the Asturias , Galicia , Old and New Castile , Estremadura , Murcia , and Andalusia , fell to the crown of Castile , which , thus extending its sway over an unbroken line of country from the Bay of Biscay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory , as well as by its antiquity , ( for it was there that the old Gothic monarchy may be said to have first revived after the great Saracen invasion , ) to be entitled to a pre-eminence over the other states of the Peninsula . This claim , indeed , appears to have been recognized at an early period of her history . Aragon did homage to Castile for her territory on the western bank of the Ebro , until the twelfth century , as did Navarre , Portugal , and , at a later period , the Moorish kingdom of Granada . 1 And , when at length the various states of Spain were consolidated into one monarchy , the capital of Castile became the capital of the new empire , and her language the language of the court and of literature . It will facilitate our inquiry into the circumstances which immediately led to these results , if we briefly glance at the prominent features in the early history and constitution of the two principal Christian states , Castile and Aragon , previous to the fifteenth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fifth century , brought with them the same liberal principles of government which distinguished their Teutonic brethren . Their crown was declared elective by a formal legislative act . 3 Laws were enacted in the great national councils , composed of prelates and nobility , and not unfrequently ratified in an assembly of the people . Their code of jurisprudence , although abounding in frivolous detail , contained many admirable provisions for the security of justice ; and , in the degree of civil liberty which it accorded to the Roman inhabitants of the country , far transcended those of most of the other barbarians of the north . 4 In short , their simple polity exhibited the germ of some of those institutions , which , with other nations , and under happier auspices , have formed the basis of a well-regulated constitutional liberty . 5 But , while in other countries the principles of a free government were slowly and gradually unfolded , their development was much accelerated in Spain by an event , which , at the time , seemed to threaten their total extinction ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . The religious , as well as the political institutions of the Arabs , were too dissimilar to those of the conquered nation , to allow the former to exercise any very sensible influence over the latter in these particulars . In the Spirit of toleration , which distinguished the early followers of Mahomet , they conceded to such of the Goths , as were willing to continue among them after the conquest , the free enjoyment of their religious , as well as of many of the civil privileges which they possessed under the ancient monarchy . 6 Under this liberal dispensation it can not be doubted , that many preferred remaining in the pleasant regions of their ancestors , to quitting them for a life of poverty and toil . These , however , appear to have been chiefly of the lower order ; 7 and the men of higher rank , or of more generous sentiments , who refused to accept a nominal and precarious independence at the hands of their oppressors , escaped from the overwhelming inundation into the neighboring countries of France , Italy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , the Asturian hills and the Pyrenees , whither the victorious Saracen disdained to pursue them . 8 Here the broken remnant of the nation endeavored to revive the forms , at least , of the ancient government . But it may well be conceived , how imperfect these must have been under a calamity , which , breaking up all the artificial distinctions of society , seemed to resolve it at once into its primitive equality . The monarch , once master of the whole Peninsula , now beheld his empire contracted to a few barren , inhospitable rocks . The noble , instead of the broad lands and thronged halls of his ancestors , saw himself at best but the chief of some wandering horde , seeking a doubtful subsistence , like himself , by rapine . The peasantry , indeed , may be said to have gained by the exchange ; and , in a situation , in which all factitious distinctions were of less worth than individual prowess and efficiency , they rose in political consequence . Even slavery , a sore evil among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin , though not effaced , lost many of its most revolting features , under the more generous legislation of later times . 9 A sensible and salutary influence , at the same time , was exerted on the moral energies of the nation , which had been corrupted in the long enjoyment of uninterrupted prosperity . Indeed , so relaxed were the morals of the court , as well as of the clergy , and so enervated had all classes become , in the general diffusion of luxury , that some authors have not scrupled to refer to these causes principally the perdition of the Gothic monarchy . An entire reformation in these habits was necessarily effected in a situation , where a scanty subsistence could only be earned by a life of extreme temperance and toil , and where it was often to be sought , sword in hand , from an enemy far superior in numbers . Whatever may have been the vices of the Spaniards , they can not have been those of effeminate sloth . Thus a sober , hardy , and independent race was gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay the foundations of far more liberal and equitable forms of government , than were known to their ancestors . At first , their progress was slow and almost imperceptible . The Saracens , indeed , reposing under the sunny skies of Andalusia , so congenial with their own , seemed willing to relinquish the sterile regions of the north to an enemy whom they despised . But , when the Spaniards , quitting the shelter of their mountains , descended into the open plains of Leon and Castile , they found themselves exposed to the predatory incursions of the Arab cavalry , who , sweeping over the face of the country , carried off in a single foray the hard-earned produce of a summer 's toil . It was not until they had reached some natural boundary , as the river Douro , or the chain of the Guadarrama , that they were enabled , by constructing a line of fortifications along these primitive bulwarks , to secure their conquests , and oppose an effectual resistance to the destructive inroads of their enemies . Their own dissensions were another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which rose from the ruins of the ancient monarchy , seemed to regard each other with even a fiercer hatred than that with which they viewed the enemies of their faith ; a circumstance that more than once brought the nation to the verge of ruin . More Christian blood was wasted in these national feuds , than in all their encounters with the infidel . The soldiers of Fernan Goncalez , a chieftain of the tenth century , complained that their master made them lead the life of very devils , keeping them in the harness day and night , in wars , not against the Saracens , but one another . 10 These circumstances so far palsied the arm of the Christians , that a century and a half elapsed after the invasion , before they had penetrated to the Douro , 11 and nearly thrice that period before they had advanced the line of conquest to the Tagus , 12 notwithstanding this portion of the country had been comparatively deserted by the Mahometans . But it was easy to foresee that a people , living , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of both physical and moral energy , must ultimately prevail over a nation oppressed by despotism , and the effeminate indulgence , to which it was naturally disposed by a sensual religion and a voluptuous climate . In truth , the early Spaniard was urged by every motive that can give efficacy to human purpose . Pent up in his barren mountains , he beheld the pleasant valleys and fruitful vineyards of his ancestors delivered over to the spoiler , the holy places polluted by his abominable rites , and the crescent glittering on the domes , which were once consecrated by the venerated symbol of his faith . His cause became the cause of Heaven . The church published her bulls of crusade , offering liberal indulgences to those who served , and Paradise to those who fell in battle , against the infidel . The ancient Castilian was remarkable for his independent resistance of papal encroachment ; but the peculiarity of his situation subjected him in an uncommon degree to ecclesiastical influence at home . Priests mingled in the council and the camp , and , arrayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . 13 They interpreted the will of Heaven as mysteriously revealed in dreams and visions . Miracles were a familiar occurrence . The violated tombs of the saints sent forth thunders and lightnings to consume the invaders ; and , when the Christians fainted in the fight , the apparition of their patron , St. James , mounted on a milk-white steed , and bearing aloft the banner of the cross , was seen hovering in the air , to rally their broken squadrons , and lead them on to victory . 14 Thus the Spaniard looked upon himself as in a peculiar manner the care of Providence . For him the laws of nature were suspended . He was a soldier of the Cross , fighting not only for his country , but for Christendom . Indeed , volunteers from the remotest parts of Christendom eagerly thronged to serve under his banner ; and the cause of religion was debated with the same ardor in Spain , as on the plains of Palestine . 15 Hence the national character became exalted by a religious fervor , which in later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence that solicitude for the purity of the faith , the peculiar boast of the Spaniards , and that deep tinge of superstition , for which they have ever been distinguished above the other nations of Europe . The long wars with the Mahometans served to keep alive in their bosoms the ardent glow of patriotism ; and this was still further heightened by the body of traditional minstrelsy , which commemorated in these wars the heroic deeds of their ancestors . The influence of such popular compositions on a simple people is undeniable . A sagacious critic ventures to pronounce the poems of Homer the principal bond which united the Grecian states . 16 Such an opinion may be deemed somewhat extravagant . It can not be doubted , however , that a poem like that of the " Cid , " which appeared as early as the twelfth century , 17 by calling up the most inspiring national recollections in connection with their favorite hero , must have operated powerfully on the moral sensibilities of the people . It is pleasing to observe , in the cordial spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sullied the character of the nation in after ages . 18 The Mahometans of this period far excelled their enemies in general refinement , and had carried some branches of intellectual culture to a height scarcely surpassed by Europeans in later times . The Christians , therefore , notwithstanding their political aversion to the Saracens , conceded to them a degree of respect , which subsided into feelings of a very different complexion , as they themselves rose in the scale of civilization . This sentiment of respect tempered the ferocity of a warfare , which , although sufficiently disastrous in its details , affords examples of a generous courtesy , that would do honor to the politest ages of Europe . 19 The Spanish Arabs were accomplished in all knightly exercises , and their natural fondness for magnificence , which shed a lustre over the rugged features of chivalry , easily communicated itself to the Christian cavaliers . In the intervals of peace , these latter frequented the courts of the Moorish princes , and mingled with their adversaries in the comparatively peaceful pleasures of the tourney , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 20 The nature of this warfare between two nations , inhabitants of the same country , yet so dissimilar in their religious and social institutions as to be almost the natural enemies of each other , was extremely favorable to the exhibition of the characteristic virtues of chivalry . The contiguity of the hostile parties afforded abundant opportunities for personal rencounter and bold romantic enterprise . Each nation had its regular military associations , who swore to devote their lives to the service of God and their country , in perpetual war against the infidel 21 The Spanish knight became the true hero of romance , wandering over his own land , and even into the remotest climes , in quest of adventures ; and , as late as the fifteenth century , we find him in the courts of England and Burgundy , doing battle in honor of his mistress , and challenging general admiration by his uncommon personal intrepidity. 22 This romantic spirit lingered in Castile , long after the age of chivalry had become extinct in other parts of Europe , continuing to nourish itself on those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caustic satire of Cervantes . Thus patriotism , religious loyalty , and a proud sense of independence , founded on the consciousness of owing their possessions to their personal valor , became characteristic traits of the Castilians previously to the sixteenth century , when the oppressive policy and fanaticism of the Austrian dynasty contrived to throw into the shade these generous virtues . Glimpses of them , however , might long be discerned in the haughty bearing of the Castilian noble , and in that erect , high-minded peasantry , whom oppression has not yet been able wholly to subdue . 23 To the extraordinary position , in which the nation was placed , may also be referred the liberal forms of its political institutions , as well as a more early development of them than took place in other countries of Europe . From the exposure of the Castilian towns to the predatory incursions of the Arabs , it became necessary , not only that they should be strongly fortified , but that every citizen should be trained to bear arms in their defence . An immense increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most effective part of the national militia . To this circumstance , as well as to the policy of inviting the settlement of frontier places by the grant of extraordinary privileges to the inhabitants , is to be imputed the early date , as well as liberal character , of the charters of community in Castile and Leon . 24 These , although varying a good deal in their details , generally conceded to the citizens the right of electing their own magistrates for the regulation of municipal affairs . Judges were appointed by this body for the administration of civil and criminal law , subject to an appeal to the royal tribunal . No person could be affected in life or property , except by a decision of this municipal court ; and no cause while pending before it could be evoked thence into the superior tribunal . In order to secure the barriers of justice more effectually against the violence of power , so often superior to law in an imperfect state of society , it was provided in many of the charters that no nobles should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community ; that no fortress or palace should be erected by them there ; that such as might reside within its territory , should be subject to its jurisdiction ; and that any violence , offered by them to its inhabitants , might be forcibly resisted with impunity . Ample and inalienable funds were provided for the maintenance of the municipal functionaries , and for other public expenses . A large extent of circumjacent country , embracing frequently many towns and villages , was annexed to each city with the right of jurisdiction over it . All arbitrary tallages were commuted for a certain fixed and moderate rent . An officer was appointed by the crown to reside within each community , whose province it was to superintend the collection of this tribute , to maintain public order , and to be associated with the magistrates of each city in the command of the forces it was bound to contribute towards the national defence . Thus while the inhabitants of the great towns in other parts of Europe were languishing in feudal servitude , the members of the Castilian corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in time of peace , and commanded by their own officers in war , were in full enjoyment of all the essential rights and privileges of freemen. 25 It is true , that they were often convulsed by intestine feuds ; that the laws were often loosely administered by incompetent judges ; and that the exercise of so many important prerogatives of independent states inspired them with feelings of independence , which led to mutual rivalry , and sometimes to open collision . But with all this , long after similar immunities in the free cities of other countries , as Italy for example , 26 had been sacrificed to the violence of faction or the lust of power , those of the Castilian cities not only remained unimpaired , but seemed to acquire additional stability with age . This circumstance is chiefly imputable to the constancy of the national legislature , which , until the voice of liberty was stifled by a military despotism , was ever ready to interpose its protecting arm in defence of constitutional rights . The earliest instance on record of popular representation in Castile occurred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antecedent to the celebrated Leicester parliament . Each city had but one vote , whatever might be the number of its representatives . A much greater irregularity , in regard to the number of cities required to send deputies to cortes on different occasions , prevailed in Castile , than ever existed in England ; 28 though , previously to the fifteenth century , this does not seem to have proceeded from any design of infringing on the liberties of the people . The nomination of these was originally vested in the householders at large , but was afterwards confined to the municipalities ; a most mischievous alteration , which subjected their election eventually to the corrupt influence of the crown . 29 They assembled in the same chamber with the higher orders of the nobility and clergy ; but , on questions of moment , retired to deliberate by themselves . 30 After the transaction of other business , their own petitions were presented to the sovereign , and his assent gave them the validity of laws . The Castilian commons , by neglecting to make their money grants depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check on its operations so beneficially exerted in the British parliament , but in vain contended for even there , till a much later period than that now under consideration . Whatever may have been the right of the nobility and clergy to attend in cortes , their sanction was not deemed essential to the validity of legislative acts ; 31 for their presence was not even required in many assemblies of the nation which occurred in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries . 32 The extraordinary power thus committed to the commons was , on the whole , unfavorable to their liberties . It deprived them of the sympathy and co-operation of the great orders of the state , whose authority alone could have enabled them to withstand the encroachments of arbitrary power , and who , in fact , did eventually desert them in their utmost need . 33 But , notwithstanding these defects , the popular branch of the Castilian cortes , very soon after its admission into that body , assumed functions and exercised a degree of power on the whole superior to that enjoyed by it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamental principle of the constitution , that no tax could be imposed without its consent ; 34 and an express enactment to this effect was suffered to remain on the statute book , after it had become a dead letter , as if to remind the nation of the liberties it had lost . 35 The commons showed a wise solicitude in regard to the mode of collecting the public revenue , oftentimes more onerous to the subject than the tax itself . They watched carefully over its appropriation to its destined uses . They restrained a too prodigal expenditure , and ventured more than once to regulate the economy of the royal household . 36 They kept a vigilant eye on the conduct of public officers , as well as on the right administration of justice , and commissions were appointed at their suggestion for inquiring into its abuses . They entered into negotiation for alliances with foreign powers , and , by determining the amount of supplies for the maintenance of troops in time of war , preserved a salutary check over military operations . 37 The nomination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of the authority to be entrusted to them . Their consent was esteemed indispensable to the validity of a title to the crown , and this prerogative , or at least the image of it , has continued to survive the wreck of their ancient liberties . 38 Finally , they more than once set aside the testamentary provisions of the sovereigns in regard to the succession . 39 Without going further into detail , enough has been said to show the high powers claimed by the commons , previously to the fifteenth century , which , instead of being confined to ordinary subjects of legislation , seem , in some instances , to have reached to the executive duties of the administration . It would , indeed , show but little acquaintance with the social condition of the Middle Ages , to suppose that the practical exercise of these powers always corresponded with their theory . We trace repeated instances , it is true , in which they were claimed and successfully exerted ; while , on the other hand , the multiplicity of remedial statutes proves too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the violence of the privileged orders , or the more artful and systematic usurpations of the crown . But , far from being intimidated by such acts , the representatives in cortes were ever ready to stand forward as the intrepid advocates of constitutional freedom ; and the unqualified boldness of their language on such occasions , and the consequent concessions of the sovereign , are satisfactory evidence of the real extent of their power , and show how cordially they must have been supported by public opinion . It would be improper to pass by without notice an anomalous institution peculiar to Castile , which sought to secure the public tranquillity by means scarcely compatible themselves with civil subordination . I refer to the celebrated Hermandad , or Holy Brotherhood , as the association was sometimes called , a name familiar to most readers in the lively fictions of Le Sage , though conveying there no very adequate idea of the extraordinary functions which it assumed at the period under review . Instead of a regularly organized police , it then consisted of a confederation of the principal cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defence of their liberties in seasons of civil anarchy . Its affairs were conducted by deputies , who assembled at stated intervals for this purpose , transacting their business under a common seal , enacting laws which they were careful to transmit to the nobles and even the sovereign himself , and enforcing their measures by an armed force . This wild kind of justice , so characteristic of an unsettled state of society , repeatedly received the legislative sanction ; and , however formidable such a popular engine may have appeared to the eye of the monarch , he was often led to countenance it by a sense of his own impotence , as well as of the overweening power of the nobles , against whom it was principally directed . Hence these associations , although the epithet may seem somewhat overstrained , have received the appellation of " cortes extraordinary . " 40 With these immunities , the cities of Castile attained a degree of opulence and splendor unrivalled , unless in Italy , during the middle ages . At a very early period , indeed , their contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of agriculture , and a dexterity in the mechanic arts unknown in other parts of Christendom . 41 On the occupation of a conquered town , we find it distributed into quarters or districts , appropriated to the several crafts , whose members were incorporated into guilds , under the regulation of magistrates and by-laws of their own appointment . Instead of the unworthy disrepute , into which the more humble occupations have since fallen in Spain , they were fostered by a liberal patronage , and their professors in some instances elevated to the rank of knighthood. 42 The excellent breed of sheep , which early became the subject of legislative solicitude , furnished them with an important staple which , together with the simpler manufactures and the various products of a prolific soil , formed the materials of a profitable commerce . 43 Augmentation of wealth brought with it the usual appetite for expensive pleasures ; and the popular diffusion of luxury in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries is attested by the fashionable invective of the satirist , and by the impotence of repeated sumptuary enactments. 44 Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction of useful public works . Cities , from which the nobles had once been so jealously excluded , came now to be their favorite residence . 45 But , while their sumptuous edifices and splendid retinues dazzled the eyes of the peaceful burghers , their turbulent spirit was preparing the way for those dismal scenes of faction , which convulsed the little commonwealths to their centre during the latter half of the fifteenth century . The flourishing condition of the communities gave their representatives a proportional increase of importance in the national assembly . The liberties of the people seemed to take deeper root in the midst of those political convulsions , so frequent in Castile , which unsettled the ancient prerogatives of the crown . Every new revolution was followed by new concessions on the part of the sovereign , and the popular authority continued to advance with a steady progress until the accession of Henry the Third , of Trastamara , in 1393 , when it may be said to have reached its zenith . A disputed title and a disastrous war compelled the father of this prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a deference unknown to his predecessors . We find four of their number admitted into his privy council , and six associated in the regency , to which he confided the government of the kingdom during his son 's minority . 46 A remarkable fact , which occurred in this reign , showing the important advances made by the commons in political estimation , was the substitution of the sons of burgesses for an equal number of those of the nobility , who were stipulated to be delivered as hostages for the fulfilment of a treaty with Portugal , in 1393. 47 There will be occasion to notice , in the first chapter of this History , some of the circumstances , which , contributing to undermine the power of the commons , prepared the way for the eventual subversion of the constitution . The peculiar situation of Castile , which had been so favorable to popular rights , was eminently so to those of the aristocracy . The nobles , embarked with their sovereign in the same common enterprise of rescuing their ancient patrimony from its invaders , felt entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth , at the head of their own retainers , from their strong-holds or castles , ( the great number of which was originally implied in the name of the country , ) 48 they were continually enlarging the circuit of their territories , with no other assistance than that of their own good swords . 49 This independent mode of effecting their conquests would appear unfavorable to the introduction of the feudal system , which , although its existence in Castile is clearly ascertained , by positive law , as well as usage , never prevailed to anything like the same extent as it did in the sister kingdom of Aragon , and other parts of Europe . 50 The higher nobility , or ricos hombres , were exempted from general taxation , and the occasional attempt to infringe on this privilege in seasons of great public emergency , was uniformly repelled by this jealous body . 51 They could not be imprisoned for debt ; nor be subjected to torture , so repeatedly sanctioned in other cases by the municipal law of Castile . They had the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a right of which they liberally availed themselves . 52 They also claimed the privilege , when aggrieved , of denaturalizing themselves , or , in other words , of publicly renouncing their allegiance to their sovereign , and of enlisting under the banners of his enemy . 53 The number of petty states , which swarmed over the Peninsula , afforded ample opportunity for the exercise of this disorganizing prerogative . The Laras are particularly noticed by Mariana , as having a " great relish for rebellion , " and the Castros as being much in the habit of going over to the Moors . 54 They assumed the license of arraying themselves in armed confederacy against the monarch , on any occasion of popular disgust , and they solemnized the act by the most imposing ceremonials of religion . 55 Their rights of jurisdiction , derived to them , it would seem , originally from royal grant , 56 were in a great measure defeated by the liberal charters of incorporation , which , in imitation of the sovereign , they conceded to their vassals , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue of their birth they monopolized all the higher offices of state , as those of constable and admiral of Castile , adelantados or governors of the provinces , cities , etc. 58 They secured to themselves the grand-masterships of the military orders , which placed at their disposal an immense amount of revenue and patronage . Finally , they entered into the royal or privy council , and formed a constituent portion of the national legislature . These important prerogatives were of course favorable to the accumulation of great wealth . Their estates were scattered over every part of the kingdom , and , unlike the grandees of Spain at the present day , 59 they resided on them in person , maintaining the state of petty sovereigns , and surrounded by a numerous retinue , who served the purposes of a pageant in time of peace , and an efficient military force in war . The demesnes of John , lord of Biscay , confiscated by Alfonso the Eleventh to the use of the crown , in 1327 , amounted to more than eighty towns and castles . 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Henry the Third , could ride through his own estates all the way from Seville to Compostella , almost the two extremities of the kingdom . 61 Alvaro de Luna , the powerful favorite of John the Second , could muster twenty thousand vassals . 62 A contemporary , who gives a catalogue of the annual rents of the principal Castilian nobility at the close of the fifteenth or beginning of the following century , computes several at fifty and sixty thousand ducats a year , 63 an immense income , if we take into consideration the value of money in that age . The same writer estimates their united revenues as equal to one-third of those in the whole kingdom . 64 These ambitious nobles did not consume their fortunes , or their energies in a life of effeminate luxury . From their earliest boyhood they were accustomed to serve in the ranks against the infidel , 65 and their whole subsequent lives were occupied either with war , or with those martial exercises which reflect the image of it . Looking back with pride to their ancient Gothic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood forward as the peers , the electors of their sovereign , they could ill brook the slightest indignity at his hand . 66 With these haughty feelings and martial habits , and this enormous assumption of power , it may readily be conceived that they would not suffer the anarchical provisions of the constitution , which seemed to concede an almost unlimited license of rebellion , to remain a dead letter . Accordingly , we find them perpetually convulsing the kingdom with their schemes of selfish aggrandizement . The petitions of the commons are filled with remonstrances on their various oppressions , and the evils resulting from their long , desolating feuds . So that , notwithstanding the liberal forms of its constitution , there was probably no country in Europe , during the Middle Ages , so sorely afflicted with the vices of intestine anarchy , as Castile . These were still further aggravated by the improvident donations of the monarch to the aristocracy , in the vain hope of conciliating their attachment , but which swelled their already overgrown power to such a height , that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overshadowed that of the throne , but threatened to subvert the liberties of the state . Their self-confidence , however , proved eventually their ruin . They disdained a co-operation with the lower orders in defence of their privileges , and relied too unhesitatingly on their power as a body , to feel jealous of their exclusion from the national legislature , where alone they could have made an effectual stand against the usurpations of the crown .  --  The course of this work will bring under review the dexterous policy , by which the crown contrived to strip the aristocracy of its substantial privileges , and prepared the way for the period , when it should retain possession only of a few barren though ostentatious dignities. 67 The inferior orders of nobility , the hidalgos , ( whose dignity , like that of the ricos hombres , would seem , as their name imports , to have been originally founded on wealth , ) 68 and the cavalleros , or knights , enjoyed many of the immunities of the higher class , especially that of exemption from taxation . 69 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of Castile . Its ample privileges and its duties are defined with a precision and in a spirit of romance , that might have served for the court of King Arthur . 70 Spain was indeed the land of chivalry . The respect for the sex , which had descended from the Visigoths , 71 was mingled with the religious enthusiasm , which had been kindled in the long wars with the infidel . The apotheosis of chivalry , in the person of their apostle and patron , St. James , 72 contributed still further to this exaltation of sentiment , which was maintained by the various military orders , who devoted themselves , in the bold language of the age , to the service " of God and the ladies . " So that the Spaniard may be said to have put in action what , in other countries , passed for the extravagances of the minstrel . An example of this occurs in the fifteenth century , when a passage of arms was defended at Orbigo , not far from the shrine of Compostella , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine companions , against all comers , in the presence of John the Second and his court . Its object was to release the knight from the obligation , imposed on him by his mistress , of publicly wearing an iron collar round his neck every Thursday . The jousts continued for thirty days , and the doughty champions fought without shield or target , with weapons bearing points of Milan steel . Six hundred and twenty-seven encounters took place , and one hundred and sixty-six lances were broken , when the emprise was declared to be fairly achieved . The whole affair is narrated with becoming gravity by an eye-witness , and the reader may fancy himself perusing the adventures of a Launcelot or an Amadis. 73 The influence of the ecclesiastics in Spain may be traced back to the age of the Visigoths , when they controlled the affairs of the state in the great national councils of Toledo . This influence was maintained by the extraordinary position of the nation after the conquest . The holy warfare , in which it was embarked , seemed to require the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behalf , to interpret its mysterious omens , and to move all the machinery of miracles , by which the imagination is so powerfully affected in a rude and superstitious age . They even condescended , in imitation of their patron saint , to mingle in the ranks , and , with the crucifix in their hands , to lead the soldiers on to battle . Examples of these militant prelates are to be found in Spain so late as the sixteenth century . 74 But , while the native ecclesiastics obtained such complete ascendency over the popular mind , the Roman See could boast of less influence in Spain than in any other country in Europe . The Gothic liturgy was alone received , as canonical until the eleventh century ; 75 and , until the twelfth , the sovereign held the right of jurisdiction over all ecclesiastical causes , of collating to benefices , or at least of confirming or annulling the election of the chapters . The code of Alfonso the Tenth , however , which borrowed its principles of jurisprudence from the civil and canon law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prerogatives to the pope , who now succeeded in establishing a usurpation over ecclesiastical rights in Castile , similar to that which had been before effected in other parts of Christendom . Some of these abuses , as that of the nomination of foreigners to benefices , were carried to such an impudent height , as repeatedly provoked the indignant remonstrances of the cortes . The ecclesiastics , eager to indemnify themselves for what they had sacrificed to Rome , were more than ever solicitous to assert their independence of the royal jurisdiction . They particularly insisted on their immunity from taxation , and were even reluctant to divide with the laity the necessary burdens of a war , which , from its sacred character , would seem to have imperative claims on them . 76 Notwithstanding the immediate dependence thus established on the head of the church by the legislation of Alfonso the Tenth , the general immunities secured by it to the ecclesiastics operated as a powerful bounty on their increase ; and the mendicant orders in particular , that spiritual militia of the popes , were multiplied over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members were not only incompetent to the duties of their profession , being without the least tincture of liberal culture , but fixed a deep stain on it by the careless laxity of their morals . Open concubinage was familiarly practised by the clergy , as well as laity , of the period ; and , so far from being reprobated by the law of the land , seems anciently to have been countenanced by it . 77 This moral insensibility may probably be referred to the contagious example of their Mahometan neighbors ; but , from whatever source derived , the practice was indulged to such a shameless extent , that , as the nation advanced in refinement , in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , it became the subject of frequent legislative enactments , in which the concubines of the clergy are described as causing general scandal by their lawless effrontery and ostentatious magnificence of apparel . 78 Notwithstanding this prevalent licentiousness of the Spanish ecclesiastics , their influence became every day more widely extended , while this ascendency , for which they were particularly indebted in that rude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their enormous acquisitions of wealth . Scarcely a town was reconquered from the Moors , without a considerable portion of its territory being appropriated to the support of some ancient , or the foundation of some new , religious establishment . These were the common reservoir , into which flowed the copious streams of private as well as royal bounty ; and , when the consequences of these alienations in mortmain came to be visible in the impoverishment of the public revenue , every attempt at legislative interference was in a great measure defeated by the piety or superstition of the age . The abbess of the monastery of Huelgas , which was situated within the precincts of Burgos , and contained within its walls one hundred and fifty nuns of the noblest families in Castile , exercised jurisdiction ever fourteen capital towns , and more than fifty smaller places ; and she was accounted inferior to the queen only in dignity . 79 The archbishop of Toledo , by virtue of his office primate of Spain and grand chancellor of Castile , was esteemed , after the pope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of the fifteenth century , exceeded eighty thousand ducats ; while the gross amount of those of the subordinate beneficiaries of his church rose to one hundred and eighty thousand . He could muster a greater number of vassals than any other subject in the kingdom , and held jurisdiction over fifteen large and populous towns , besides a great number of inferior places . 80 These princely funds , when intrusted to pious prelates , were munificently dispensed in useful public works , and especially in the foundation of eleemosynary institutions , with which every great city in Castile was liberally supplied . 81 But , in the hands of worldly men , they were perverted from these noble uses to the gratification of personal vanity , or the disorganizing schemes of faction . The moral perceptions of the people , in the mean time , were confused by the visible demeanor of a hierarchy , so repugnant to the natural conceptions of religious duty . They learned to attach an exclusive value to external rites , to the forms rather than the spirit of Christianity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than their practical conduct .  --  The ancient Spaniards , notwithstanding their prevalent superstition , were untinctured with the fiercer religious bigotry of later times ; and the uncharitable temper of their priests , occasionally disclosed in the heats of religious war , was controlled by public opinion , which accorded a high degree of respect to the intellectual , as well as political superiority of the Arabs . But the time was now coming when these ancient barriers were to be broken down ; when a difference of religious sentiment was to dissolve all the ties of human brotherhood ; when uniformity of faith was to be purchased by the sacrifice of any rights , even those of intellectual freedom ; when , in fine , the Christian and the Mussulman , the oppressor and the oppressed , were to be alike bowed down under the strong arm of ecclesiastical tyranny . The means by which a revolution so disastrous to Spain was effected , as well as the incipient stages of its progress , are topics that fall within the scope of the present history . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders of the Castilian monarchy , previous to the fifteenth century , it is evident that the royal authority must have been circumscribed within very narrow limits . The numerous states , into which the great Gothic empire was broken after the conquest , were individually too insignificant to confer on their respective sovereigns the possession of extensive power , or even to authorize their assumption of that state , by which , it is supported in the eyes of the vulgar . When some more fortunate prince , by conquest or alliance , had enlarged the circle of his dominions , and thus in some measure remedied the evil , it was sure to recur upon his death , by the subdivision of his estates among his children . This mischievous practice was even countenanced by public opinion ; for the different districts of the country , in their habitual independence of each other , acquired an exclusiveness of feeling , which made it difficult for them ever cordially to coalesce ; and traces of this early repugnance to each other are to be discerned in the mutual jealousies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peninsula , after their consolidation into one monarchy for more than three centuries . The election to the crown , although no longer vested in the hands of the national assembly , as with the Visigoths , was yet subject to its approbation . The title of the heir apparent was formerly recognized by a cortes convoked for the purpose ; and , on the demise of his parent , the new sovereign again convened the estates to receive their oath of allegiance , which they cautiously withheld until he had first sworn to preserve inviolate the liberties of the constitution . Nor was this a merely nominal privilege , as was evinced on more than one memorable occasion . 82 We have seen , in our review of the popular branch of the government , how closely its authority pressed even on the executive functions of the administration . The monarch was still further controlled , in this department , by his Royal or Privy Council , consisting of the chief nobility and great officers of state , to which , in later times , a deputation of the commons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king , had cognizance of the most important public transactions , whether of a civil , military , or diplomatic nature . It was established by positive enactment , that the prince , without its consent , had no right to alienate the royal demesne , to confer pensions beyond a very limited amount , or to nominate to vacant benefices. 84 His legislative powers were to be exercised in concurrence with the cortes ; 85 and , in the judicial department , his authority , during the latter part of the period under review , seems to have been chiefly exercised in the selection of officers for the higher judicatures , from a list of candidates presented to him on a vacancy by their members concurrently with his privy council . 86 The scantiness of the king 's revenue corresponded with that of his constitutional authority . By an ancient law , indeed , of similar tenor with one familiar to the Saracens , the sovereign was entitled to a fifth of the spoils of victory . 87 This , in the course of the long wars with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were enjoyed by any prince in Christendom . But several circumstances concurred to prevent it . The long minorities , with which Castile was afflicted perhaps more than any country in Europe , frequently threw the government into the hands of the principal nobility , who perverted to their own emoluments the high powers intrusted to them . They usurped the possessions of the crown , and invaded some of its most valuable privileges ; so that the sovereign 's subsequent life was often consumed in fruitless attempts to repair the losses of his minority . He sometimes , indeed , in the impotence of other resources , resorted to such unhappy expedients as treachery and assassination . 88 A pleasant tale is told by the Spanish historians , of the more innocent device of Henry the Third , for the recovery of the estates extorted from the crown by the rapacious nobles during his minority . Returning home late one evening , fatigued and half famished , from a hunting expedition , he was chagrined to find no refreshment prepared for him , and still more so , to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit to purchase it . The day 's sport , however , fortunately furnished the means of appeasing the royal appetite ; and , while this was in progress , the steward took occasion to contrast the indigent condition of the king with that of his nobles , who habitually indulged in the most expensive entertainments , and were that very evening feasting with the archbishop of Toledo . The prince , suppressing his indignation , determined , like the far-famed caliph in the " Arabian Nights , " to inspect the affair in person , and , assuming a disguise , introduced himself privately into the archbishop 's palace , where he witnessed with his own eyes the prodigal magnificence of the banquet , teeming with costly wines and the most luxurious viands . The next day he caused a rumor to be circulated through the court , that he had fallen suddenly and dangerously ill . The courtiers , at these tidings , thronged to the palace ; and , when they had all assembled , the king made his appearance among them , bearing his naked sword in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severity , seated himself on his throne at the upper extremity of the apartment . After an interval of silence in the astonished assembly , the monarch , addressing himself to the primate , inquired of him , " How many sovereigns he had known in Castile ? " The prelate answering four , Henry put the same question to the duke of Benevente , and so on to the other courtiers in succession . None of them , however , having answered more than five , " How is this , " said the prince , " that you , who are so old , should have known so few , while I , young as I am , have beheld more than twenty ! Yes , " continued he , raising his voice , to the astonished multitude , " you are the real sovereigns of Castile , enjoying all the rights and revenues of royalty , while I , stripped of my patrimony , have scarcely wherewithal to procure the necessaries of life . " Then giving a concerted signal , his guards entered the apartment , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of death . The dismayed nobles , not relishing the turn the jest appeared likely to take , fell on their knees before the monarch and besought his forgiveness , promising , in requital , complete restitution of the fruits of their rapacity . Henry , content with having so cheaply gained his point , allowed himself to soften at their entreaties , taking care , however , to detain their persons as security for their engagements , until such time as the rents , royal fortresses , and whatever effects had been filched from the crown , were restored . The story , although repeated by the gravest Castilian writers , wears , it must be owned , a marvellous tinge of romance . But , whether fact , or founded on it , it may serve to show the dilapidated condition of the revenues at the beginning of the fourteenth century , and its immediate causes . 89 Another circumstance , which contributed to impoverish the exchequer , was the occasional political revolutions in Castile , in which the adhesion of a faction was to be purchased only by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the violent revolution , which placed the House of Trastamara on the throne , in the middle of the fourteenth century . But perhaps a more operative cause , than all these , of the alleged evil , was the conduct of those imbecile princes , who , with heedless prodigality , squandered the public resources on their own personal pleasures and unworthy minions . The disastrous reigns of John the Second and Henry the Fourth , extending over the greater portion of the fifteenth century , furnish pertinent examples of this . It was not unusual , indeed , for the cortes , interposing its paternal authority , by passing an act for the partial resumption of grants thus illegally made , in some degree to repair the broken condition of the finances . Nor was such a resumption unfair to the actual proprietors . The promise to maintain the integrity of the royal demesnes formed an essential part of the coronation oath of every sovereign ; and the subject , on whom he afterwards conferred them , knew well by what a precarious , illicit tenure he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented of the Castilian constitution at the beginning of the fifteenth century , it is apparent , that the sovereign was possessed of less power , and the people of greater , than in other European monarchies at that period . It must be owned , however , as before intimated , that the practical operation did not always correspond with the theory of their respective functions in these rude times ; and that the powers of the executive , being susceptible of greater compactness and energy in their movements , than could possibly belong to those of more complex bodies , were sufficiently strong in the hands of a resolute prince , to break down the comparatively feeble barriers of the law . Neither were the relative privileges , assigned to the different orders of the state , equitably adjusted . Those of the aristocracy were indefinite and exorbitant . The license of armed combinations too , so freely assumed both by this order and the commons , although operating as a safety-valve for the escape of the effervescing spirit of the age , was itself obviously repugnant to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils scarcely less disastrous than those which it was intended to prevent . It was apparent , that , notwithstanding the magnitude of the powers conceded to the nobility and the commons , there were important defects , which prevented them from resting on any sound and permanent basis . The representation of the people in cortes , instead of partially emanating , as in England , from an independent body of landed proprietors , constituting the real strength of the nation , proceeded exclusively from the cities , whose elections were much more open to popular caprice and ministerial corruption , and whose numerous local jealousies prevented them from acting in cordial co-operation . The nobles , notwithstanding their occasional coalitions , were often arrayed in feuds against each other . They relied , for the defence of their privileges , solely on their physical strength , and heartily disdained , in any emergency , to support their own cause by identifying it with that of the commons . Hence , it became obvious , that the monarch , who , notwithstanding his limited prerogative , assumed the anomalous privilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the legislature , and of occasionally dispensing altogether with the attendance of the other , might , by throwing his own influence into the scale , give the preponderance to whichever party he should prefer ; and , by thus dexterously availing himself of their opposite forces , erect his own authority on the ruins of the weaker .  --  How far and how successfully this policy was pursued by Ferdinand and Isabella , will be seen in the course of this History . * * * * * Notwithstanding the general diligence of the Spanish historians , they have done little towards the investigation of the constitutional antiquities of Castile , until the present century . Dr. Geddes 's meagre notice of the cortes preceded probably , by a long interval , any native work upon that subject . Robertson frequently complains of the total deficiency of authentic sources of information respecting the laws and government of Castile ; a circumstance , that suggests to a candid mind an obvious explanation of several errors , into which he has fallen . Capmany , in the preface to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seville , in 1809 , on the ancient organization of the cortes in the different states of the Peninsula , remarks , that " no author has appeared , down to the present day , to instruct us in regard to the origin , constitution , and celebration of the Castilian cortes , on all which topics there remains the most profound ignorance . " The melancholy results to which such an investigation must necessarily lead , from the contrast it suggests of existing institutions to the freer forms of antiquity , might well have deterred the modern Spaniard from these inquiries ; which , moreover , it can hardly be supposed , would have received the countenance of government . The brief interval , however , in the early part of the present century , when the nation so ineffectually struggled to resume its ancient liberties , gave birth to two productions , which have gone far to supply the desiderata in this department . I allude to the valuable works of Marina , on the early legislation , and on the cortes , of Castile , to which repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially , presents us with a full exposition of the appropriate functions assigned to the several departments of government , and with the parliamentary history of Castile deduced from original unpublished records . It is unfortunate that his copious illustrations are arranged in so unskilful a manner as to give a dry and repulsive air to the whole work . The original documents , on which it is established , instead of being reserved for an appendix , and their import only conveyed in the text , stare at the reader in every page , arrayed in all the technicalities , periphrases , and repetitions incident to legal enactments . The course of the investigation is , moreover , frequently interrupted by impertinent dissertations on the constitution of 1812 , in which the author has fallen into abundance of crudities , which he would have escaped , had he but witnessed the practical operation of those liberal forms of government , which he so justly admires . The sanguine temper of Marina has also betrayed him into the error of putting , too uniformly , a favorable construction on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitutional precedent from what can only be regarded as an accidental and transient exertion of power in a season of popular excitement . The student of this department of Spanish history may consult , in conjunction with Marina , Sempere 's little treatise , often quoted , on the History of the Castilian Cortes . It is , indeed , too limited and desultory in its plan to afford anything like a complete view of the subject . But , as a sensible commentary , by one well skilled in the topics that he discusses , it is of undoubted value . Since the political principles and bias of the author were of an opposite character to Marina 's , they frequently lead him to opposite conclusions in the investigation of the same facts . Making all allowance for obvious prejudices , Sempere 's work , therefore , may be of much use in correcting the erroneous impressions made by the former writer , whose fabric of liberty too often rests , as exemplified more than once in the preceding pages , on an ideal basis . But , with every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribution to political science . They exhibit an able analysis of a constitution , which becomes singularly interesting , from its having furnished , together with that of the sister kingdom of Aragon , the earliest example of representative government , as well as from the liberal principles on which that government was long administered . FOOTNOTES 1 Aragon was formally released from this homage in 1177 , and Portugal in 1264 .

The Moorish empire of Granada , so interesting in itself , and so dissimilar , in all respects , to Christian Spain , merits particular attention . I have deferred the consideration of it , however , to that period of the history which is occupied with its subversion . See Part I. , Chapter 8. 3 See the Canons of the fifth Council of Toledo . Florez , Espana Sagrada , ( Madrid , 1747-1776 , ) tom . vi . p. 168. 4 Recesvinto , in order more effectually to bring about the consolidation of his Gothic and Roman subjects into one nation , abrogated the law prohibiting their intermarriage . The terms in which his enactment is conceived disclose a far more enlightened policy than that pursued either by the Franks or Lombards .

( Los Doctores Asso y Manuel , Instituciones del Derecho Civil de Castilla , ( Madrid , 1792 , ) pp. 6 , 7 . ) A second edition , under the supervision of the Royal Spanish Academy , was published in 1815 . This compilation , notwithstanding the apparent rudeness and even ferocity of some of its features , may be said to have formed the basis of all the subsequent legislation of Castile . It was , doubtless , the exclusive contemplation of these features , which brought upon these laws the sweeping condemnation of Montesquieu , as " pueriles , gauches , idiotes ,  - -  frivoles dans le fond et gigantesques dans le style . " Espirit des Loix , liv . 28 , chap . 1 . 5 Some of the local usages , afterwards incorporated in the fueros , or charters , of the Castilian communities , may probably be derived from the time of the Visigoths . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenor of the legal institutions of this people and their immediate descendants , from an article in the sixty-first Number of the Edinburgh Review , written with equal learning and vivacity 6 The Christians , in all matters exclusively relating to themselves , were governed by their own laws , ( See the Fuero Juzgo , Introd. p. 40 , ) administered by their own judges , subject only in capital cases to an appeal to the Moorish tribunals . Their churches and monasteries ( rosae inter spinas , says the historian ) were scattered over the principal towns , Cordova retaining seven , Toledo six , etc. ; and their clergy were allowed to display the costume , and celebrate the pompous ceremonial , of the Romish communion . Florez , Espana Sagrada , tom . x. trat. 33 , cap , 7.  - -  Morales , Coronica General de Espana , ( Obras , Madrid , 1791-1793 , ) lib. 12 , cap . 78.  --  Conde , Domination de los Arabes , part 1 , cap . 15 , 22. 7 Morales , Coronica , lib. 12 , cap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Moors appear in the record of those times . ( See Salazar de Mendoza , Monarquia de Espana , ( Madrid , 1770 , ) tom . i. p. 34 , note . ) If we could rely on a singular fact , quoted by Zurita , we might infer that a large proportion of the Goths were content to reside among their Saracen conquerors . The intermarriages among the two nations had been so frequent , that , in 1311 , the ambassador of James II. , of Aragon , stated to his Holiness , Pope Clement V. , that of 200.000 persons composing the population of Granada , not more than 500 were of pure Moorish descent ! ( Anales de la Corona de Aragon , ( Zaragoza , 1610 , ) lib. 5 , cap . 93 . ) As the object of the statement was to obtain certain ecclesiastical aids from the pontiff , in the prosecution of the Moorish war , it appears very suspicious , notwithstanding the emphasis laid on it by the historian . 8 Bleda , Coronica de los Moros de Espana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author states , that in his time there were several families in Ireland , whose patronymics bore testimony to their descent from these Spanish exiles . That careful antiquarian , Morales , considers the regions of the Pyrenees lying betwixt Aragon and Navarre , together with the Asturias , Biscay , Guipuscoa , the northern portion of Galicia and the Alpuxarras , ( the last retreat , too , of the Moors , under the Christian domination , ) to have been untouched by the Saracen invaders . See lib. 12 , cap . 76. 9 The lot of the Visigothic slave was sufficiently hard . The oppressions , which this unhappy race endured , were such as to lead Mr. Southey , in his excellent Introduction to the " Chronicle of the Cid , " to impute to their co-operation , in part , the easy conquest of the country by the Arabs . But , although the laws , in relation to them , seem to be taken up with determining their incapacities rather than their privileges , it is probable that they secured to them , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as was enjoyed by similar classes in the rest of Europe . By the Fuero Juzgo , the slave was allowed to acquire property for himself , and with it to purchase his own redemption . ( Lib. 5 , tit. 4 , ley 16 . ) A certain proportion of every man 's slaves were also required to bear arms , and to accompany their master to the field . ( Lib. 9 , tit 2 , ley 8 . ) But their relative rank is better ascertained by the amount of composition ( that accurate measurement of civil rights with all the barbarians of the north ) prescribed for any personal violence inflicted on them . Thus , by the Salic law , the life of a free Roman was estimated at only one-fifth of that of a Frank , ( Lex Salica , tit. 43 , sec. 1 , 8 ; ) while , by the law of the Visigoths , the life of a slave was valued at half of that of a freeman , ( lib. 6 , tit. 4 , ley 1 . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibited , under the severe penalties of banishment and sequestration of property , from either maiming or murdering his own slave , ( lib. 6 , tit. 5 , leyes 12 , 13 ; ) while , in other codes of the barbarians , the penalty was confined to similar trespasses on the slaves of another ; and , by the Salic law , no higher mulct was imposed for killing , than for kidnapping a slave . ( Lex Salica , tit. 11 , sec. 1 , 3 . ) The legislation of the Visigoths , in those particulars , seems to have regarded this unhappy race as not merely a distinct species of property . It provided for their personal security , instead of limiting itself to the indemnification of their masters . 10 Coronica General , part . 3 , fol. 54. 11 According to Morales , ( Coronica , lib. 13 , cap . 57 , ) this took place about 850. 12 Toledo was not reconquered until 1085 ; Lisbon , in 1147. 13 The archbishops of Toledo , whose revenues and retinues far exceeded those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy wars .

" Hist. de Espana , tom . ii . p. 14. 14 The first occasion , on which the military apostle condescended to reveal himself to the Leonese , was the memorable day of Clavijo , A. D. 844 , when 70,000 infidels fell on the field . From that time , the name of St. Jago became the battle-cry of the Spaniards . The truth of the story is attested by a contemporary charter of Ramiro I. to the church of the saint , granting it an annual tribute of corn and wine from the towns in his dominions , and a knight 's portion of the spoils of every victory over the Mussulmans . The privilegio del voto , as it is called , is given at length by Florez in his Collection , ( Espana Sagrada , tom . xix. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish historians , as Garibay , Mariana , Morales , and others .  --  More sharp-sighted critics discover , in its anachronisms , and other palpable blunders , ample evidence of its forgery .

Pope Pascal II . acted like a man of sense , when he sent back certain Spanish adventurers , who had embarked in the wars of Palestine , telling them that " the cause of religion could be much better served by them at home . " 16 See Heeren , Politics of Ancient Greece , translated by Bancroft , chap . 7. 17 The oldest manuscript extant of this poem , ( still preserved at Bivar , the hero 's birth-place , ) bears the date of 1207 , or at latest 1307 , for there is some obscurity in the writing .

( Madrid 1779-90 , ) tom . i. p. 223 . ) Some of the late Spanish antiquaries have manifested a skepticism in relation to the " Cid , " truly alarming . A volume was published at Madrid , in 1792 , by Risco , under the title of " Castilla , o Historia de Rodrigo Diaz , " etc. , which the worthy father ushered into the world with much solemnity , as a transcript of an original manuscript coeval with the time of the " Cid , " and fortunately discovered by him in an obscure corner of some Leonese monastery . ( Prologo ) . Masdeu , in an analysis of this precious document , has been led to scrutinize the grounds on which the reputed achievements of the " Cid " have rested from time immemorial , and concludes with the startling assertion , that " of Rodrigo Diaz , el Campeador , we absolutely know nothing with any degree of probability , not even his existence !

Critica , tom . xx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his countrymen , that will thus coolly acquiesce in the annihilation of their favorite hero , whose exploits have been the burden of chronicle , as well as romance , from the twelfth century down to the present day . They may find a warrant for their fond credulity , in the dispassionate judgment of one of the greatest of modern historians , John Muller , who , so far from doubting the existence of the Campeador , has succeeded , in his own opinion at least , in clearing from his history the " mists of fable and extravagance , " in which it has been shrouded . See his Life of the Cid , appended to Escobar 's " Romancero , " edited by the learned and estimable Dr. Julius , of Berlin . Frankfort , 1828. 18 A modern minstrel inveighs loudly against this charity of his ancestors , who devoted their " cantos de cigarra , " to the glorification of this " Moorish rabble , " instead of celebrating the prowess of the Cid , Bernardo , and other worthies of their own nation . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generous brother of the craft . " No es culpa si de los Moros los valientes hechos cantan , pues tanto mas resplandecen nuestras celebres hazanas ; que el encarecer los hechos del vencido en la batalla , engrandece al vencedor , aunque no hablen de el palabra . " Duran , Romancero de Romances Moriscos , ( Madrid , 1828. ) p. 227. 19 When the empress queen of Alfonso VII . was besieged in the castle of Azeca , in 1139 , she reproached the Moslem cavaliers for their want of courtesy and courage in attacking a fortress defended by a female . They acknowledged the justice of the rebuke , and only requested that she would condescend to show herself to them from her palace ; when the Moorish chivalry , after paying their obeisance to her in the most respectful manner , instantly raised the siege , and departed . ( Ferreras , Histoire Generale d'Espagne , traduite par d'Hermilly , ( Paris , 1742-51. ) tom . in. p. 410 . ) It was a frequent occurrence to restore a noble captive to liberty without ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . sent back to their father two daughters of a Moorish prince , who formed part of the spoils of the battle of Tarifa .

" 21 This singular fact , of the existence of an Arabic military order , is recorded by Conde . ( Dominacion de los Arabes , tom . i. p. 619 , note . ) The brethren were distinguished for the simplicity of their attire , and their austere and frugal habits . They were stationed on the Moorish marches , and were bound by a vow of perpetual war against the Christian infidel . As their existence is traced as far back as 1030 , they may possibly have suggested the organization of similar institutions in Christendom , which they preceded by a century at least . The loyal historians of the Spanish military orders , it is true , would carry that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. , in the ninth century ; ( Caro de Torres , Historia de las Ordenes Militares de Santiago , Calatrava , y Alcantara , ( Madrid , 1629 , ) fol. 2.  --  Rades y Andrada , Chronica de las Tres Ordenes y Cavallerias , ( Toledo , 1572 , ) fol. 4 , ) but less prejudiced critics , as Zurita and Mariana , are content with dating it from the papal bull of Alexander III. , 1175. 22 In one of the Paston letters , we find the notice of a Spanish knight appearing at the court of Henry VI. , " wyth a Kercheff of Plesaunce iwrapped aboute hys arme , the gwych Knight , " says the writer , " wyl renne a cours wyth a sharpe spere for his sou'eyn lady sake . " ( Fenn , Original Letters , ( 1787 , ) vol. i. p. 6 . ) The practice of using sharp spears , instead of the guarded and blunted weapons usual in the tournament , seems to have been affected by the chivalrous nobles of Castile ; many of whom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this circumstance , in the splendid tourney given in honor of the nuptials of Blanche of Navarre and Henry , son of John II .

But the extent of municipal immunities conceded to , or rather assumed by , the Italian cities at this early period , is very equivocal ; for their indefatigable antiquarian confesses that all , or nearly all their archives , previous to the time of Frederick I. , ( the latter part of the twelfth century , ) had perished amid their frequent civil convulsions . ( See the subject in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( Napoli , 1752 , ) dissert. 45 . ) Acts of enfranchisement became frequent in Spain during the eleventh century ; several of which are preserved , and exhibit , with sufficient precision , the nature of the privileges accorded to the inhabitants .  --  Robertson , who wrote when the constitutional antiquities of Castile had been but slightly investigated , would seem to have little authority , therefore , for deriving the establishment of communities from Italy , and still less for tracing their progress through France and Germany to Spain . See his History of the Reign of the Emperor Charles V , ( London , 1796 , ) vol. i. pp. 29 , 30. 25 For this account of the ancient polity of the Castilian cities , the reader is referred to Sempere , Histoire des Cortes d'Espagne , ( Bordeaux , 1815 , ) and Marina 's valuable works , Ensayo Historico-Critico sobre la Antigua Legislacion de Camilla , ( Nos. 160-196 , ) and Teoria de las Cortes , ( Madrid , 1813 , part . 2 , cap . 21-23 , ) where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustration . 26 The independence of the Lombard cities had been sacrificed , according to the admission of their enthusiastic historian , about the middle of the thirteenth century .

( Hist. d'Espagne , tom . iii . p. 484 ) Neither of these authors notices the presence of the commons in this assembly ; although the phrase used by the Chronicle , los cibdadanos , is perfectly unequivocal . 28 Capmany , Practica y Estilo de Celebrar Cortes en Aragon , Cataluna , y Valencia , ( Madrid , 1821 , ) pp. 230 , 231.  --  Whether the convocation of the third estate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or was in a manner forced on him by the growing power and importance of the cities , it is now too late to inquire . It is nearly as difficult to settle on what principles the selection of cities to be represented depended . Marina asserts , that every great town and community was entitled to a seat in the legislature , from the time of receiving its municipal charter from the sovereign , ( Teoria , tom . i. p. 138 ; ) and Sempere agrees , that this right became general , from the first , to all who chose to avail themselves of it . ( Histoire des Cortes , p. 56 . ) The right , probably , was not much insisted on by the smaller and poorer places , which , from the charges it involved , felt it often , no doubt , less of a boon than a burden . This , we know , was the case in England . 29 It was an evil of scarcely less magnitude , that contested elections were settled by the crown . ( Capmany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ latter of these practices , and , indeed , the former to a certain extent , are to be met with in English history . 30 Marina leaves this point in some obscurity . ( Teoria , tom . i. cap . 28 . ) Indeed , there seems to have been some irregularity in the parliamentary usages themselves . From minutes of a meeting of cortes at Toledo , in 1538 , too soon for any material innovation on the ancient practice , we find the three estates sitting in separate chambers , from the very commencement to the close of the session . See the account drawn up by the count of Coruna , apud Capmany , Practica y Estilo , pp. 240 et seq . 31 This , however , so contrary to the analogy of other European governments , is expressly contradicted by the declaration of the nobles , at the cortes of Toledo , in 1538 .

" Relacion del Conde de Coruna , apud Capmany , Practica y Estilo , p. 247. 32 This omission of the privileged orders was almost uniform under Charles V. and his successors . But it would be unfair to seek for constitutional precedent in the usages of a government , whose avowed policy was altogether subversive of the constitution . 33 During the famous war of the Comunidades , under Charles V. For the preceding paragraph consult Marina , ( Teoria , part . 1 , cap . 10 , 20 , 26 , 29 , ) and Capmany . ( Practica y Estilo , pp. 220-250 . ) The municipalities of Castile seem to have reposed but a very limited confidence in their delegates , whom they furnished with instructions , to which they were bound to conform themselves literally .

( Teoria , part . 2 , cap . 19 , 20 . ) Their interference in what is so generally held the peculiar province of the executive , was perhaps encouraged by the sovereign , with the politic design of relieving himself of the responsibility of measures whose success must depend eventually on their support .

It was filled with an active population , employed in the various mechanic arts . Its domestic fabrics , as well as natural products , of oil , wine , wool , etc. , supplied a trade with Prance , Flanders , Italy , and England . ( Zuniga , Annales de Sevilla , p. 341.  --  See also Sempere , Historia del Luxo , p. 81 , nota 2 . ) The ports of Biscay , which belonged to the Castilian crown , were the marts of an extensive trade with the north , during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries .

This popular opinion is erroneous , since it engaged the attention of government , and became the subject of legislation as anciently as 1273 , under Alfonso the Wise . ( See Asso y Manuel , Instituciones , Introd. p. 56 . ) Capmany , however , dates the great improvement in the breed of Spanish sheep from the year 1394 , when Catharine of Lancaster brought with her , as a part of her dowry to the heir apparent of Castile , a flock of English merinos , distinguished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , for the beauty and delicacy of their fleece .

That treatise is very elaborate and ample , and brings under view all the different coins of Ferdinand and Isabella 's time , settling their specific value with great accuracy . The calculation is attended with considerable difficulty , owing to the depreciation of the value of the precious metals , and the repeated adulteration of the real . In his tables , at the end , he exhibits the commercial value of the different denominations , ascertained by the quantity of wheat ( as sure a standard as any ) , which they would buy at that day . Taking the average of values , which varied considerably in different years of Ferdinand and Isabella , it appears that the ducat , reduced to our own currency , will be equal to about eight dollars and seventy-seven cents , and the dobla to eight dollars and fifty-six cents . 64 The ample revenues of the Spanish grandee of the present time , instead of being lavished on a band of military retainers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more peaceful hospitality of supporting an almost equally formidable host of needy relations and dependants .

The political institutions of Aragon , although bearing a general resemblance to those of Castile , were sufficiently dissimilar to stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which still continued after it had been incorporated with the great mass of the Spanish monarchy .  --  It was not until the expiration of nearly five centuries after the Saracen invasion , that the little district of Aragon , growing up under the shelter of the Pyrenees , was expanded into the dimensions of the province which now bears that name . During this period , it was painfully struggling into being , like the other states of the Peninsula , by dint of fierce , unintermitted warfare with the infidel . Even after this period , it would probably have filled but an insignificant space in the map of history , and , instead of assuming an independent station , have been compelled , like Navarre , to accommodate itself to the politics of the potent monarchies by which it was surrounded , had it not extended its empire by a fortunate union with Catalonia in the twelfth , and the conquest of Valencia in the thirteenth century . 1 These new territories were not only far more productive than its own , but , by their long line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hitherto pent up within their barren mountains , to open a communication with distant regions . The ancient county of Barcelona had reached a higher degree of civilization than Aragon , and was distinguished by institutions quite as liberal . The sea-board would seem to be the natural seat of liberty . There is something in the very presence , in the atmosphere of the ocean , which invigorates not only the physical , but the moral energies of man . The adventurous life of the mariner familiarizes him with dangers , and early accustoms him to independence . Intercourse with various climes opens new and more copious sources of knowledge ; and increased wealth brings with it an augmentation of power and consequence . It was in the maritime cities scattered along the Mediterranean that the seeds of liberty , both in ancient and modern times , were implanted and brought to maturity . During the Middle Ages , when the people of Europe generally maintained a toilsome and infrequent intercourse with each other , those situated on the margin of this inland ocean found an easy mode of communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war too as in peace , and this long period is filled with their international contests , while the other free cities of Christendom were wasting themselves in civil feuds and degrading domestic broils . In this wide and various collision their moral powers were quickened by constant activity ; and more enlarged views were formed , with a deeper consciousness of their own strength , than could be obtained by those inhabitants of the interior , who were conversant only with a limited range of objects , and subjected to the influence of the same dull , monotonous circumstances . Among these maritime republics , those of Catalonia were eminently conspicuous . By the incorporation of this country with the kingdom of Aragon , therefore , the strength of the latter was greatly augmented . The Aragonese princes , well aware of this , liberally fostered institutions to which the country owed its prosperity , and skilfully availed themselves of its resources for the aggrandizement of their own dominions . They paid particular attention to the navy , for the more perfect discipline of which a body of laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was designed to render it invincible . No allusion whatever is made in this stern code to the mode of surrendering to , or retreating from the enemy . The commander , who declined attacking any force not exceeding his own by more than one vessel , was punished with death . 2 The Catalan navy successfully disputed the empire of the Mediterranean with the fleets of Pisa , and still more of Genoa . With its aid , the Aragonese monarchs achieved the conquest successively of Sicily , Sardinia , and the Balearic Isles , and annexed them to the empire . 3 It penetrated into the farthest regions of the Levant ; and the expedition of the Catalans into Asia , which terminated with the more splendid than useful acquisition of Athens , forms one of the most romantic passages in this stirring and adventurous era. 4 But , while the princes of Aragon were thus enlarging the bounds of their dominion abroad , there was probably not a sovereign in Europe possessed of such limited authority at home . The three great states with their dependencies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statute of James the Second , in 1319 , inalienable and indivisible . 5 Each of them , however , maintained a separate constitution of government , and was administered by distinct laws . As it would be fruitless to investigate the peculiarities of their respective institutions , which bear a very close affinity to one another , we may confine ourselves to those of Aragon , which exhibit a more perfect model than those either of Catalonia or Valencia , and have been far more copiously illustrated by her writers . The national historians refer the origin of their government to a written constitution of about the middle of the ninth century , fragments of which are still preserved in certain ancient documents and chronicles . On occurrence of a vacancy in the throne , at this epoch , a monarch was elected by the twelve principal nobles , who prescribed a code of laws , to the observance of which he was obliged to swear before assuming the sceptre . The import of these laws was to circumscribe within very narrow limits the authority of the sovereign , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and these same peers , who , in case of a violation of the compact by the monarch , were authorized to withdraw their allegiance , and , in the bold language of the ordinance , " to substitute any other ruler in his stead , even a pagan , if they listed . " 6 The whole of this wears much of a fabulous aspect , and may remind the reader of the government which Ulysses met with in Phaeacia ; where King Alcinous is surrounded by his " twelve illustrious peers or archons , " subordinate to himself , " who , " says he , " rule over the people , I myself being the thirteenth . " 7 But , whether true or not , this venerable tradition must be admitted to have been well calculated to repress the arrogance of the Aragonese monarchs , and to exalt the minds of their subjects by the image of ancient liberty which it presented . 8 The great barons of Aragon were few in number . They affected to derive their descent from the twelve peers above mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by this epithet , that they were not indebted for their creation to the will of the sovereign . No estate could be legally conferred by the crown , as an honor ( the denomination of fiefs in Aragon ) , on any but one of these high nobles . This , however , was in time evaded by the monarchs , who advanced certain of their own retainers to a level with the ancient peers of the land ; a measure which proved a fruitful source of disquietude. 9 No baron could be divested of his fief , unless by public sentence of the Justice and the cortes . The proprietor , however , was required , as usual , to attend the king in council , and to perform military service , when summoned , during two months in the year , at his own charge . 10 The privileges , both honorary and substantial , enjoyed by the ricos hombres , were very considerable . They filled the highest posts in the state . They originally appointed judges in their domains for the cognizance of certain civil causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlimited criminal jurisdiction . They were excused from taxation except in specified cases ; were exempted from all corporal and capital punishment ; nor could they be imprisoned , although their estates might be sequestrated for debt . A lower class of nobility styled infanzones , equivalent to the Castilian hidalgos , together with the caballeros , or knights , were also possessed of important though inferior immunities. 11 The king distributed among the great barons the territory reconquered from the Moors , in proportions determined by the amount of their respective services . We find a stipulation to this effect from James the First to his nobles , previous to his invasion of Majorca . 12 On a similar principle they claimed nearly the whole of Valencia . 13 On occupying a city , it was usual to divide it into barrios , or districts , each of which was granted by way of fief to some one of the ricos hombres , from which he was to derive his revenue . What proportion of the conquered territory was reserved for the royal demesne does not appear . 14 We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the latter part of the fourteenth century , manning a fleet of king 's ships on his own credit ; another , of the ancient family of Luna , in the fifteenth century , so wealthy that he could travel through an almost unbroken line of his estates all the way from Castile to France . 15 With all this , their incomes in general , in this comparatively poor country , were very inferior to those of the great Castilian lords . 16 The laws conceded certain powers to the aristocracy of a most dangerous character . They were entitled , like the nobles of the sister kingdom , to defy , and publicly renounce their allegiance to their sovereign , with the whimsical privilege , in addition , of commending their families and estates to his protection , which he was obliged to accord , until they were again reconciled . 17 The mischievous right of private war was repeatedly recognized by statute . It was claimed and exercised in its full extent , and occasionally with circumstances of peculiar atrocity . An instance is recorded by Zurita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecuted with such inveteracy that the parties bound themselves by solemn oath never to desist from it during their lives , and to resist every effort , even on the part of the crown itself , to effect a pacification between them . 18 This remnant of barbarism lingered longer in Aragon than in any other country in Christendom . The Aragonese sovereigns , who were many of them possessed of singular capacity and vigor , 19 made repeated efforts to reduce the authority of their nobles within more temperate limits . Peter the Second , by a bold stretch of prerogative , stripped them of their most important rights of jurisdiction . 20 James the Conqueror artfully endeavored to counterbalance their weight by that of the commons and the ecclesiastics. 21 But they were too formidable when united , and too easily united , to be successfully assailed . The Moorish wars terminated , in Aragon , with the conquest of Valencia , or rather the invasion of Murcia , by the middle of the thirteenth century . The tumultuous spirits of the aristocracy , therefore , instead of finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditions , were turned within , and convulsed their own country with perpetual revolution . Haughty from the consciousness of their exclusive privileges and of the limited number who monopolized them , the Aragonese barons regarded themselves rather as the rivals of their sovereign , than as his inferiors . Intrenched within the mountain fastnesses , which the rugged nature of the country everywhere afforded , they easily bade defiance to his authority . Their small number gave a compactness and concert to their operations , which could not have been obtained in a multitudinous body . Ferdinand the Catholic well discriminated the relative position of the Aragonese and Castilian nobility , by saying , " it was as difficult to divide the one , as to unite the other . " 22 These combinations became still more frequent after formally receiving the approbation of King Alfonso the Third , who , in 1287 , signed the two celebrated ordinances entitled the " Privileges of Union , " by which his subjects were authorized to resort to arms on an infringement of their liberties . 23 The hermandad of Castile had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resorted to as a measure of police , and was directed more frequently against the disorders of the nobility , than of the sovereign ; it was organized with difficulty , and , compared with the union of Aragon , was cumbrous and languid in its operations . While these privileges continued in force , the nation was delivered over to the most frightful anarchy . The least offensive movement on the part of the monarch , the slightest encroachment on personal right or privilege , was the signal for a general revolt . At the cry of Union , that " last voice , " says the enthusiastic historian , " of the expiring republic , full of authority and majesty , and an open indication of the insolence of kings , " the nobles and the citizens eagerly rushed to arms . The principal castles belonging to the former were pledged as security for their fidelity , and intrusted to conservators , as they were styled , whose duty it was to direct the operations and watch over the interests of the Union . A common seal was prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , intimating at once their loyalty and their resolution , and a similar device was displayed on the standard and the other military insignia of the confederates. 24 The power of the monarch was as nothing before this formidable array . The Union appointed a council to control all his movements , and , in fact , during the whole period of its existence , the reigns of four successive monarchs , it may be said to have dictated law to the land . At length Peter the Fourth , a despot in heart , and naturally enough impatient of this eclipse of regal prerogative , brought the matter to an issue , by defeating the army of the Union , at the memorable battle of Epila , in 1348 , " the last , " says Zurita , " in which it was permitted to the subject to take up arms against the sovereign for the cause of liberty . " Then , convoking an assembly of the states at Saragossa , he produced before them the instrument containing the two Privileges , and cut it in pieces with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hand , he suffered the blood to trickle upon the parchment , exclaiming , that " a law which had been the occasion of so much blood , should be blotted out by the blood of a king . " 25 All copies of it , whether in the public archives , or in the possession of private individuals , were ordered , under a heavy penalty , to be destroyed . The statute passed to that effect carefully omits the date of the detested instrument , that all evidence of its existence might perish with it . 26 Instead of abusing his victory , as might have been anticipated from his character , Peter adopted a far more magnanimous policy . He confirmed the ancient privileges of the realm , and made in addition other wise and salutary concessions . From this period , therefore , is to be dated the possession of constitutional liberty in Aragon ; ( for surely the reign of unbridled license , above described , is not deserving that name ; ) and this not so much from the acquisition of new immunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of the old . The court of the Justicia , that great barrier interposed by the constitution between despotism on the one hand and popular license on the other , was more strongly protected , and causes hitherto decided by arms were referred for adjudication to this tribunal . 27 From this period , too , the cortes , whose voice was scarcely heard amid the wild uproar of preceding times , was allowed to extend a beneficial and protecting sway over the land . And , although the social history of Aragon , like that of other countries in this rude age , is too often stained with deeds of violence and personal feuds , yet the state at large , under the steady operation of its laws , probably enjoyed a more uninterrupted tranquillity than fell to the lot of any other nation in Europe . The Aragonese cortes was composed of four branches , or arms ; 28 the ricos hombres , or great barons ; the lesser nobles , comprehending the knights ; the clergy , and the commons . The nobility of every denomination were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hombres were allowed to appear by proxy , and a similar privilege was enjoyed by baronial heiresses . The number of this body was very limited , twelve of them constituting a quorum . 29 The arm of the ecclesiastics embraced an ample delegation from the inferior as well as higher clergy . 30 It is affirmed not to have been a component of the national legislature until more than a century and a half after the admission of the commons . 31 Indeed , the influence of the church was much less sensible in Aragon , than in the other kingdoms of the peninsula . Notwithstanding the humiliating concessions of certain of their princes to the papal see , they were never recognized by the nation , who uniformly asserted their independence of the temporal supremacy of Rome ; and who , as we shall see hereafter , resisted the introduction of the Inquisition , that last stretch of ecclesiastical usurpation , even to blood . 32 The commons enjoyed higher consideration and civil privileges than in Castile . For this they were perhaps somewhat indebted to the example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally extended to other parts of the Aragonese monarchy . The charters of certain cities accorded to the inhabitants privileges of nobility , particularly that of immunity from taxation ; while the magistrates of others were permitted to take their seats in the order of hidalgos. 33 From a very early period we find them employed in offices of public trust , and on important missions . 34 The epoch of their admission into the national assembly is traced as far back as 1133 , several years earlier than the commencement of popular representation in Castile . 35 Each city had the right of sending two or more deputies selected from persons eligible to its magistracy ; but with the privilege of only one vote , whatever might be the number of its deputies . Any place , which had been once represented in cortes , might always claim to be so . 36 By a statute of 1307 , the convocation of the states , which had been annual , was declared biennial . The kings , however , paid little regard to this provision , rarely summoning them except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crown , whatever might be their personal rank , were jealously excluded from their deliberations . The session was opened by an address from the king in person , a point of which they were very tenacious ; after which the different arms withdrew to their separate apartments . 38 The greatest scrupulousness was manifested in maintaining the rights and dignity of the body ; and their intercourse with one another , and with the king , was regulated by the most precise forms of parliamentary etiquette . 39 The subjects of deliberation were referred to a committee from each order , who , after conferring together , reported to their several departments . Every question , it may be presumed , underwent a careful examination ; as the legislature , we are told , was usually divided into two parties , " the one maintaining the rights of the monarch , the other , those of the nation , " corresponding nearly enough with those of our day . It was in the power of any member to defeat the passage of a bill , by opposing to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might even interpose his negative on the proceedings of the house , and thus put a stop to the prosecution of all further business during the session . This anomalous privilege , transcending even that claimed in the Polish diet , must have been too invidious in its exercise , and too pernicious in its consequences , to have been often resorted to . This may be inferred from the fact , that it was not formally repealed until the reign of Philip the Second , in 1592 . During the interval of the sessions of the legislature , a deputation of eight was appointed , two from each arm , to preside over public affairs , particularly in regard to the revenue , and the security of justice ; with authority to convoke a cortes extraordinary , whenever the exigency might demand it . 40 The cortes exercised the highest functions whether of a deliberative , legislative , or judicial nature . It had a right to be consulted on all matters of importance , especially on those of peace and war . No law was valid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it carefully provided for the application of the revenue to its destined uses . 41 It determined the succession to the crown ; removed obnoxious ministers ; reformed the household , and domestic expenditure , of the monarch ; and exercised the power , in the most unreserved manner , of withholding supplies , as well as of resisting what it regarded as an encroachment on the liberties of the nation . 42 The excellent commentators on the constitution of Aragon have bestowed comparatively little attention on the development of its parliamentary history ; confining themselves too exclusively to mere forms of procedure . The defect has been greatly obviated by the copiousness of their general historians . But the statute-book affords the most unequivocal evidence of the fidelity with which the guardians of the realm discharged the high trust reposed in them , in the numerous enactments it exhibits , for the security both of person and property . Almost the first page which meets the eye in this venerable record contains the General Privilege , the Magna Charta , as it has been well denominated , of Aragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cortes at Saragossa , in 1283 . It embraces a variety of provisions for the fair and open administration of justice ; for ascertaining the legitimate powers intrusted to the cortes ; for the security of property against exactions of the crown ; and for the conservation of their legal immunities to the municipal corporations and the different orders of nobility . In short , the distinguishing excellence of this instrument , like that of Magna Charta , consists in the wise and equitable protection which it affords to all classes of the community . 43 The General Privilege , instead of being wrested , like King John 's charter , from a pusillanimous prince , was conceded , reluctantly enough , it is true , in an assembly of the nation , by one of the ablest monarchs who ever sat on the throne of Aragon , at a time when his arms , crowned with repeated victory , had secured to the state the most important of her foreign acquisitions . The Aragonese , who rightly regarded the General Privilege as the broadest basis of their liberties , repeatedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many and such various precautions , " says Blancas , " did our ancestors establish that freedom which their posterity have enjoyed ; manifesting a wise solicitude , that all orders of men , even kings themselves , confined within their own sphere , should discharge their legitimate functions without jostling or jarring with one another ; for in this harmony consists the temperance of our government . Alas ! " he adds , " how much of all this has fallen into desuetude from its antiquity , or been effaced by new customs . " 44 The judicial functions of the cortes have not been sufficiently noticed by writers . They were extensive in their operation , and gave it the name of the General Court . They were principally directed to protect the subject from the oppressions of the crown and its officers ; over all which cases it possessed original and ultimate jurisdiction . The suit was conducted before the Justice , as president of the cortes , in its judicial capacity , who delivered an opinion conformable to the will of the majority . 45 The authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fully equal to providing adequate relief in all these cases . 46 But for several reasons this parliamentary tribunal was preferred . The process was both more expeditious and less expensive to the suitor . Indeed , " the most obscure inhabitant of the most obscure village in the kingdom , although a foreigner , " might demand redress of this body ; and , if he was incapable of bearing the burden himself , the state was bound to maintain his suit , and provide him with counsel at its own charge . But the most important consequence , resulting from this legislative investigation , was the remedial laws frequently attendant on it . " And our ancestors , " says Blancas , " deemed it great wisdom patiently to endure contumely and oppression for a season , rather than seek redress before an inferior tribunal , since , by postponing their suit till the meeting of cortes , they would not only obtain a remedy for their own grievance , but one of a universal and permanent application . " 47 The Aragonese cortes maintained a steady control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union ; and the weight of the commons was more decisive in it , than in other similar assemblies of that period . Its singular distribution into four estates was favorable to this . The knights and hidalgos , an intermediate order between the great nobility and the people , when detached from the former , naturally lent additional support to the latter , with whom , indeed , they had considerable affinity . The representatives of certain cities , as well as a certain class of citizens , were entitled to a seat in this body ; 48 so that it approached both in spirit and substance to something like a popular representation . Indeed , this arm of the cortes was so uniformly vigilant in resisting any encroachment on the part of the crown , that it has been said to represent , more than any other , the liberties of the nation . 49 In some other particulars the Aragonese commons possessed an advantage over those of Castile . 1 . By postponing their money grants to the conclusion of the session , and regulating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they availed themselves of an important lever relinquished by the Castilian cortes . 50 2 . The kingdom of Aragon proper was circumscribed within too narrow limits to allow of such local jealousies and estrangements , growing out of an apparent diversity of interests , as existed in the neighboring monarchy . Their representatives , therefore , were enabled to move with a more hearty concert , and on a more consistent line of policy . 3 . Lastly , the acknowledged right to a seat in cortes , possessed by every city which had once been represented there , and this equally whether summoned or not , if we may credit Capmany , 51 must have gone far to preserve the popular branch from the melancholy state of dilapidation to which it was reduced in Castile by the arts of despotic princes . Indeed , the kings of Aragon , notwithstanding occasional excesses , seem never to have attempted any systematic invasion of the constitutional rights of their subjects . They well knew , that the spirit of liberty was too high among them to endure it . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by quoting the example of her brother the king of Castile , to punish certain refractory citizens of Valencia , he prudently replied , " My people are free , and not so submissive as the Castilians . They respect me as their prince , and I hold them for good vassals and comrades . " 52 No part of the constitution of Aragon has excited more interest , or more deservedly , than the office of the Justicia , or Justice ; 53 whose extraordinary functions were far from being limited to judicial matters , although in these his authority was supreme . The origin of this institution is affirmed to have been coeval with that of the constitution or frame of government itself . 54 If it were so , his authority may be said , in the language of Blancas , " to have slept in the scabbard " until the dissolution of the Union ; when the control of a tumultuous aristocracy was exchanged for the mild and uniform operation of the law , administered by this , its supreme interpreter . His most important duties may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the validity of all royal letters and ordinances . He possessed , as has been said , concurrent jurisdiction with the cortes over all suits against the crown and its officers . Inferior judges were bound to consult him in all doubtful cases , and to abide by his opinion , as of " equal authority , " in the words of an ancient jurist , " with the law itself . " 55 An appeal lay to his tribunal from those of the territorial and royal judges . 56 He could even evoke a cause , while pending before them , into his own court , and secure the defendant from molestation on his giving surety for his appearance . By another process , he might remove a person under arrest from the place in which he had been confined by order of an inferior court , to the public prison appropriated to this purpose , there to abide his own examination of the legality of his detention . These two provisions , by which the precipitate and perhaps intemperate proceedings of subordinate judicatures were subjected to the revision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient security for personal liberty and property . 57 In addition to these official functions , the Justice of Aragon was constituted a permanent counsellor of the sovereign , and , as such , was required to accompany him where-ever he might reside . He was to advise the king on all constitutional questions of a doubtful complexion ; and finally , on a new accession to the throne , it was his province to administer the coronation oath ; this he performed with his head covered , and sitting , while the monarch , kneeling before him bare-headed , solemnly promised to maintain the liberties of the kingdom . A ceremony eminently symbolical of that superiority of law over prerogative , which was so constantly asserted in Aragon. 58 It was the avowed purpose of the institution of the Justicia to interpose such an authority between the crown and the people , as might suffice for the entire protection of the latter . This is the express import of one of the laws of Soprarbe , which , whatever he thought of their authenticity , are undeniably of very high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on by the most eminent juridical writers of the nation . Whatever estimate , therefore , may be formed of the real extent of his powers , as compared with those of similar functionaries in other states of Europe , there can be no doubt that this ostensible object of their creation , thus openly asserted , must have had a great tendency to enforce their practical operation . Accordingly we find repeated examples , in the history of Aragon , of successful interposition on the part of the Justice for the protection of individuals persecuted by the crown , and in defiance of every attempt at intimidation . 60 The kings of Aragon , chafed by this opposition , procured the resignation or deposition , on more than one occasion , of the obnoxious magistrate . 61 But , as such an exercise of prerogative must have been altogether subversive of an independent discharge of the duties of this office , it was provided by a statute of Alfonso the Fifth , in 1442 , that the Justice should continue in office during life , removable only , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 62 Several provisions were enacted , in order to secure the nation more effectually against the abuse of the high trust reposed in this officer . He was to be taken from the equestrian order , which , as intermediate between the high nobility and the people , was less likely to be influenced by undue partiality to either . He could not be selected from the ricos hombres , since this class was exempted from corporal punishment , while the Justice was made responsible to the cortes for the faithful discharge of his duties , under penalty of death . 63 As this supervision of the whole legislature was found unwieldy in practice , it was superseded , after various modifications by a commission of members elected from each one of the four estates , empowered to sit every year in Saragossa , with authority to investigate the charges preferred against the Justice , and to pronounce sentence upon him . 64 The Aragonese writers are prodigal of their encomiums on the pre-eminence and dignity of this functionary , whose office might seem , indeed , but a doubtful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its success less on any legal powers confided to it , than on the efficient and constant support of public opinion . Fortunately the Justice of Aragon uniformly received such support , and was thus enabled to carry the original design of the institution into effect , to check the usurpations of the crown , as well as to control the license of the nobility and the people . A series of learned and independent magistrates , by the weight of their own character , gave additional dignity to the office . The people , familiarized with the benignant operation of the law , referred to peaceful arbitration those great political questions , which , in other countries at this period , must have been settled by a sanguinary revolution . 65 While , in the rest of Europe , the law seemed only the web to ensnare the weak , the Aragonese historians could exult in the reflection , that the fearless administration of justice in their land " protected the weak equally with the strong , the foreigner with the native . " Well might their legislature assert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the poverty of the nation , and the sterility of their soil . " 66 The governments of Valencia and Catalonia , which , as has been already remarked , were administered independently of each other after their consolidation into one monarchy , bore a very near resemblance to that of Aragon. 67 No institution , however , corresponding in its functions with that of the Justicia , seems to have obtained in either . 68 Valencia , which had derived a large portion of its primitive population , after the conquest , from Aragon , preserved the most intimate relations with the parent kingdom , and was constantly at its side during the tempestuous season of the Union . The Catalans were peculiarly jealous of their exclusive privileges , and their civil institutions wore a more democratical aspect than those of any other of the confederated states ; circumstances , which led to important results that fall within the compass of our narrative . 69 The city of Barcelona , which originally gave its name to the county of which it was the capital , was distinguished from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union with Aragon in the twelfth century , the monarchs of the latter kingdom extended towards it the same liberal legislation ; so that , by the thirteenth , Barcelona had reached a degree of commercial prosperity rivalling that of any of the Italian republics . She divided with them the lucrative commerce with Alexandria ; and her port , thronged with foreigners from every nation , became a principal emporium in the Mediterranean for the spices , drugs , perfumes , and other rich commodities of the east , whence they were diffused over the interior of Spain and the European continent . 71 Her consuls , and her commercial factories , were established in every considerable port in the Mediterranean and in the north of Europe . 72 The natural products of her soil , and her various domestic fabrics , supplied her with abundant articles of export . Fine wool was imported by her in considerable quantities from England in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , and returned there manufactured into cloth ; an exchange of commodities the reverse of that existing between the two nations at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having established the first bank of exchange and deposit in Europe , in 1401 ; it was devoted to the accommodation of foreigners as well as of her own citizens . She claims the glory , too , of having compiled the most ancient written code , among the moderns , of maritime law now extant , digested from the usages of commercial nations , and which formed the basis of the mercantile jurisprudence of Europe during the Middle Ages . 74 The wealth which flowed in upon Barcelona , as the result of her activity and enterprise , was evinced by her numerous public works , her docks , arsenal , warehouses , exchange , hospitals , and other constructions of general utility . Strangers , who visited Spain in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries , expatiate on the magnificence of this city , its commodious private edifices , the cleanliness of its streets and public squares ( a virtue by no means usual in that day ) , and on the amenity of its gardens and cultivated environs. 75 But the peculiar glory of Barcelona was the freedom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or council of one hundred , and a body of regidores or counsellors , as they were styled , varying at times from four to six in number ; the former intrusted with the legislative , the latter with the executive functions of administration . A large proportion of these bodies were selected from the merchants , tradesmen , and mechanics of the city . They were invested , not merely with municipal authority , but with many of the rights of sovereignty . They entered into commercial treaties with foreign powers ; superintended the defence of the city in time of war ; provided for the security of trade ; granted letters of reprisal against any nation who might violate it ; and raised and appropriated the public moneys for the construction of useful works , or the encouragement of such commercial adventures as were too hazardous or expensive for individual enterprise . 76 The counsellors , who presided over the municipality , were complimented with certain honorary privileges , not even accorded to the nobility . They were addressed by the title of magnificos ; were seated , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were preceded by mace-bearers , or lictors , in their progress through the country ; and deputies from their body to the court were admitted on the footing , and received the honors , of foreign ambassadors . 77 These , it will be recollected , were plebeians ,  --  merchants and mechanics . Trade never was esteemed a degradation in Catalonia , as it came to be in Castile . 78 The professors of the different arts , as they were called , organized into guilds or companies , constituted so many independent associations , whose members were eligible to the highest municipal offices . And such was the importance attached to these offices , that the nobility in many instances , resigning the privileges of their rank , a necessary preliminary , were desirous of being enrolled among the candidates for them . 79 One can not but observe in the peculiar organization of this little commonwealth , and in the equality assumed by every class of its citizens , a close analogy to the constitutions of the Italian republics ; which the Catalans , having become familiar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted as the model of their own . Under the influence of these democratic institutions , the burghers of Barcelona , and indeed of Catalonia in general , which enjoyed more or less of a similar freedom , assumed a haughty independence of character beyond what existed among the same class in other parts of Spain ; and this , combined with the martial daring fostered by a life of maritime adventure and warfare , made them impatient , not merely of oppression , but of contradiction , on the part of their sovereigns , who have experienced more frequent and more sturdy resistance from this quarter of their dominions , than from every other . 80 Navagiero , the Venetian ambassador to Spain , early in the sixteenth century , although a republican himself , was so struck with what he deemed the insubordination of the Barcelonians , that he asserts , " The inhabitants have so many privileges , that the king scarcely retains any authority over them ; their liberty , " he adds , " should rather go by the name of license . " 81 One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenacity with which they adhered to their most inconsiderable immunities . Ferdinand the First , in 1416 , being desirous , in consequence of the exhausted state of the finances on his coming to the throne , to evade the payment of a certain tax or subsidy customarily paid by the kings of Aragon to the city of Barcelona , sent for the president of the council , John Fiveller , to require the consent of that body to this measure . The magistrate , having previously advised with his colleagues , determined to encounter any hazard , says Zurita , rather than compromise the rights of the city . He reminded the king of his coronation oath , expressed his regret that he was willing so soon to deviate from the good usages of his predecessors , and plainly told him , that he and his comrades would never betray the liberties entrusted to them . Ferdinand , indignant at this language , ordered the patriot to withdraw into another apartment , where he remained in much uncertainty as to the consequences of his temerity . But the king was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the representation of his courtiers , who warned him not to reckon too much on the patience of the people , who bore small affection to his person , from the little familiarity with which he had treated them in comparison with their preceding monarchs , and who were already in arms to protect their magistrate . In consequence of these suggestions , Ferdinand deemed it prudent to release the counsellor , and withdrew abruptly from the city on the ensuing day , disgusted at the ill success of his enterprise . 82 The Aragonese monarchs well understood the value of their Catalan dominions , which sustained a proportion of the public burdens equal in amount to that of both the other states of the kingdom . 83 Notwithstanding the mortifications , which they occasionally experienced from this quarter , therefore , they uniformly extended towards it the most liberal protection . A register of the various customs paid in the ports of Catalonia , compiled in 1413 , under the above-mentioned Ferdinand , exhibits a discriminating legislation , extraordinary in an age when the true principles of financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , in 1227 , a navigation act , limited in its application , was published , and another under Alfonso the Fifth , in 1454 , embracing all the dominions of Aragon ; thus preceding by some centuries the celebrated ordinance , to which England owes so much of her commercial grandeur . 85 The brisk concussion given to the minds of the Catalans in the busy career in which they were engaged , seems to have been favorable to the development of poetical talent , in the same manner as it was in Italy . Catalonia may divide with Provence the glory of being the region where the voice of song was first awakened in modern Europe . Whatever may be the relative claims of the two countries to precedence in this respect , 86 it is certain that under the family of Barcelona , the Provencal of the south of France reached its highest perfection ; and , when the tempest of persecution in the beginning of the thirteenth century fell on the lovely valleys of that unhappy country , its minstrels found a hospitable asylum in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only protected , but cultivated the gay science with considerable success . 87 Their names have descended to us , as well as those of less illustrious troubadours , whom Petrarch and his contemporaries did not disdain to imitate ; 88 but their compositions , for the most part , lie still buried in those cemeteries of the intellect so numerous in Spain , and call loudly for the diligence of some Sainte Palaye or Raynouard to disinter them . 89 The languishing condition of the poetic art , at the close of the fourteenth century , induced John the First , who mingled somewhat of the ridiculous even with his most respectable tastes , to depute a solemn embassy to the king of France , requesting that a commission might be detached from the Floral Academy of Toulouse , into Spain , to erect there a similar institution . This was accordingly done , and the Consistory of Barcelona was organized , in 1390 . The kings of Aragon endowed it with funds , and with a library valuable for that day , presiding over its meetings in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the troubles consequent on the death of Martin , this establishment fell into decay , until it was again revived , on the accession of Ferdinand the First , by the celebrated Henry , marquis of Villena , who transplanted it to Tortosa. 90 The marquis , in his treatise on the gaya sciencia , details with becoming gravity the pompous ceremonial observed in his academy on the event of a public celebration . The topics of discussion were " the praises of the Virgin , love , arms , and other good usages . " The performances of the candidates , " inscribed on parchment of various colors , richly enamelled with gold and silver , and beautifully illuminated , " were publicly recited , and then referred to a committee , who made solemn oath to decide impartially and according to the rules of the art . On the delivery of the verdict , a wreath of gold was deposited on the victorious poem , which was registered in the academic archives ; and the fortunate troubadour , greeted with a magnificent prize , was escorted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; " thus manifesting to the world , " says the marquis , " the superiority which God and nature have assigned to genius over dulness. " 91 The influence of such an institution in awakening a poetic spirit is at best very questionable . Whatever effect an academy may have in stimulating the researches of science , the inspirations of genius must come unbidden ; " Adflata est numine quando Jam propiore del . " The Catalans , indeed , seem to have been of this opinion ; for they suffered the Consistory of Tortosa to expire with its founder . Somewhat later , in 1430 , was established the University of Barcelona , placed under the direction of the municipality , and endowed by the city with ample funds for instruction in the various departments of law , theology , medicine , and the belles-lettres . This institution survived until the commencement of the last century . 92 During the first half of the fifteenth century , long after the genuine race of the troubadours had passed away , the Provencal or Limousin verse was carried to its highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presumptuous for any one , who has not made the Romance dialects his particular study , to attempt a discriminating criticism of these compositions , so much of the merit of which necessarily consists in the almost impalpable beauties of style and expression . The Spaniards , however , applaud , in the verses of Ausias March , the same musical combinations of sound , and the same tone of moral melancholy , which pervade the productions of Petrarch. 94 In prose too , they have ( to borrow the words of Andres ) their Boccaccio in Martorell ; whose fiction of " Tirante el Blanco " is honored by the commendation of the curate in Don Quixote , as " the best book in the world of the kind , since the knights-errant in it eat , drink , sleep , and die quietly in their beds , like other folk , and very unlike most heroes of romance . " The productions of these , and some other of their distinguished contemporaries , obtained a general circulation very early by means of the recently invented art of printing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language has long since ceased to be the language of literature . On the union of the two crowns of Castile and Aragon , the dialect of the former became that of the court and of the Muses . The beautiful Provencal , once more rich and melodious than any other idiom in the Peninsula , was abandoned as a patois to the lower orders of the Catalans , who , with the language , may boast that they also have inherited the noble principles of freedom which distinguished their ancestors . * * * * * The influence of free institutions in Aragon is perceptible in the familiarity displayed by its writers with public affairs , and in the freedom with which they have discussed the organization , and general economy of its government . The creation of the office of national chronicler , under Charles V. , gave wider scope to the development of historic talent . Among the most conspicuous of these historiographers was Jerome Blancas , several of whose productions , as the " Coronaciones de los Reyes , " " Modo de Proceder en Cortes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last , have been repeatedly quoted in the preceding section . This work presents a view of the different orders of the state , and particularly of the office of the Justicia , with their peculiar functions and privileges . The author , omitting the usual details of history , has devoted himself to the illustration of the constitutional antiquities of his country , in the execution of which he has shown a sagacity and erudition equally profound . His sentiments breathe a generous love of freedom , which one would scarcely suppose to have existed , and still less to have been promulgated , under Philip II . His style is distinguished by the purity and even elegance of its latinity . The first edition , being that which I have used , appeared in 1588 , in folio , at Saragossa , executed with much typographical beauty . The work was afterwards incorporated into Schottus 's " Hispania Illustrata. "  --  Blancas , after having held his office for ten years , died in his native city of Saragossa , in 1590 . Jerome Martel , from whose little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have also liberally cited , was appointed public historiographer in 1597 . His continuation of Zurita 's Annals , which he left unpublished at his decease , was never admitted to the honors of the press , because , says his biographer , Uztarroz , verdades lastiman ; a reason as creditable to the author as disgraceful to the government . A third writer , and the one chiefly relied on for the account of Catalonia , is Don Antonio Capmany . His " Memorias Historicas de Barcelona , " ( 5 tom . 4to , Madrid , 1779-1792 , ) may be thought somewhat too discursive and circumstantial for his subject ; but it is hardly right to quarrel with information so rare , and painfully collected ; the sin of exuberance at any rate is much less frequent , and more easily corrected , than that of sterility . His work is a vast repertory of facts relating to the commerce , manufactures , general policy , and public prosperity , not only of Barcelona , but of Catalonia . It is written with an independent and liberal spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the genius of the institutions which he celebrates .  --  Capmany closed his useful labors at Madrid , in 1810 , at the age of fifty-six . Notwithstanding the interesting character of the Aragonese constitution , and the amplitude of materials for its history , the subject has been hitherto neglected , as far as I am aware , by continental writers . Robertson and Hallam , more especially the latter , have given such a view of its prominent features to the English reader , as must , I fear , deprive the sketch which I have attempted , in a great degree , of novelty . To these names must now be added that of the author of the " History of Spain and Portugal , " ( Cabinet Cyclopaedia , ) whose work , published since the preceding pages were written , contains much curious and learned disquisition on the early jurisprudence and municipal institutions of both Castile and Aragon .

They voted by ballot , and the majority decided . Such , after various modifications , were the regulations ultimately adopted in 1461 , or rather 1467 .

This last siege , 1713-14 , in which it held out against the combined forces of France and Spain under Marshal Berwick , is one of the most memorable events in the eighteenth century .

Illustration : GENEALOGY OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA . PART FIRST . 1406-1492 . THE PERIOD WHEN THE DIFFERENT KINGDOMS OF SPAIN WERE FIRST UNITED UNDER ONE MONARCHY , AND A THOROUGH REFORM WAS INTRODUCED INTO THEIR INTERNAL ADMINISTRATION ; OR THE PERIOD EXHIBITING MOST FULLY THE DOMESTIC POLICY OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA .

Revolution of Trastamara.  --  Accession of John II .  --  Rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Commons .  --  Its Consequences .  - -  Early Literature of Castile .  --  Its Encouragement under John II .  --  Decline of Alvaro de Luna.  --  His Fall .  --  Death of John II .  --  Birth of Isabella . The fierce civil feuds , which preceded the accession of the House of Trastamara in 1368 , were as fatal to the nobility of Castile , as the wars of the Hoses were to that of England . There was scarcely a family of note , which had not poured out its blood on the field or the scaffold . The influence of the aristocracy was , of course , much diminished with its numbers . The long wars with foreign powers , which a disputed succession entailed on the country , were almost equally prejudicial to the authority of the monarch , who was willing to buoy up his tottering title by the most liberal concession of privileges to the people . Thus the commons rose in proportion as the crown and the privileged orders descended in the scale ; and , when the claims of the several competitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingdom was secured , by the union of Henry the Third with Catharine of Lancaster at the close of the fourteenth century , the third estate may be said to have attained to the highest degree of political consequence which it ever reached in Castile . The healthful action of the body politic , during the long interval of peace that followed this auspicious union , enabled it to repair the strength , which had been wasted in its murderous civil contests . The ancient channels of commerce were again opened ; various new manufactures were introduced , and carried to a considerable perfection ; 1 wealth , with its usual concomitants , elegance and comfort , flowed in apace ; and the nation promised itself a long career of prosperity under a monarch , who respected the laws in his own person , and administered them with vigor . All these fair hopes were blasted by the premature death of Henry the Third , before he had reached his twenty-eighth year . The crown devolved on his son John the Second , then a minor , whose reign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Castilian annals . 2 As it was that , however , which gave birth to Isabella , the illustrious subject of our narrative , it will be necessary to pass its principal features under review , in order to obtain a correct idea of her government . The wise administration of the regency , during a long minority , postponed the season of calamity ; and when it at length arrived , it was concealed for some time from the eyes of the vulgar by the pomp and brilliant festivities , which distinguished the court of the young monarch . His indisposition , if not incapacity for business , however , gradually became manifest ; and , while he resigned himself without reserve to pleasures , which it must be confessed were not unfrequently of a refined and intellectual character , he abandoned the government of his kingdom to the control of favorites . The most conspicuous of these was Alvaro de Luna , grand master of St. James , and constable of Castile . This remarkable person , the illegitimate descendant of a noble house in Aragon , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where he soon distinguished himself by his amiable manners and personal accomplishments . He could ride , fence , dance , sing , if we may credit his loyal biographer , better than any other cavalier in the court ; while his proficiency in music and poetry recommended him most effectually to the favor of the monarch , who professed to be a connoisseur in both . With these showy qualities , Alvaro de Luna united others of a more dangerous complexion . His insinuating address easily conciliated confidence , and enabled him to master the motives of others , while his own were masked by consummate dissimulation . He was as fearless in executing his ambitious schemes , as he was cautious in devising them . He was indefatigable in his application to business , so that John , whose aversion to it we have noticed , willingly reposed on him the whole burden of government . The king , it was said , only signed , while the constable dictated and executed . He was the only channel of promotion to public office , whether secular or ecclesiastical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great trust confided to him to the acquisition of the principal posts in the government for himself or his kindred , and at his death is said to have left a larger amount of treasure than was possessed by the whole nobility of the kingdom . He affected a magnificence of state corresponding with his elevated rank . The most considerable grandees in Castile contended for the honor of having their sons , after the fashion of the time , educated in his family . When he rode abroad , he was accompanied by a numerous retinue of knights and nobles , which left his sovereign 's court comparatively deserted ; so that royalty might be said on all occasions , whether of business or pleasure , to be eclipsed by the superior splendors of its satellite . 3 The history of this man may remind the English reader of that of Cardinal Wolsey , whom he somewhat resembled in character , and still more in his extraordinary fortunes . It may easily be believed , that the haughty aristocracy of Castile would ill brook this exaltation of an individual so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wear his honors with exemplary meekness . John 's blind partiality for his favorite is the key to all the troubles which agitated the kingdom during the last thirty years of his reign . The disgusted nobles organized confederacies for the purpose of deposing the minister . The whole nation took sides in this unhappy struggle . The heats of civil discord were still further heightened by the interference of the royal house of Aragon , which , descended from a common stock with that of Castile , was proprietor of large estates in the latter country . The wretched monarch beheld even his own son Henry , the heir to the crown , enlisted in the opposite faction , and saw himself reduced to the extremity of shedding the blood of his subjects in the fatal battle of Olmedo . Still the address , or the good fortune , of the constable enabled him to triumph over his enemies ; and , although he was obliged occasionally to yield to the violence of the storm and withdraw a while from the court , he was soon recalled and reinstated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king is imputed by the writers of that age to sorcery on the part of the favorite . 4 But the only witchcraft which he used , was the ascendency of a strong mind over a weak one . During this long-protracted anarchy , the people lost whatever they had gained in the two preceding reigns . By the advice of his minister , who seems to have possessed a full measure of the insolence , so usual with persons suddenly advanced from low to elevated station , the king not only abandoned the constitutional policy of his predecessors in regard to the commons , but entered on the most arbitrary and systematic violation of their rights . Their deputies were excluded from the privy council , or lost all influence in it . Attempts were made to impose taxes without the legislative sanction . The municipal territories were alienated , and lavished on the royal minions . The freedom of elections was invaded , and delegates to cortes were frequently nominated by the crown ; and , to complete the iniquitous scheme of oppression , pragmaticas , or royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged law of the land , and affirming in the most unqualified terms the right of the sovereign to legislate for his subjects . 5 The commons indeed , when assembled in cortes , stoutly resisted the assumption of such unconstitutional powers by the crown , and compelled the prince not only to revoke his pretensions , but to accompany his revocation with the most humiliating concessions . 6 They even ventured so far , during this reign , as to regulate the expenses of the royal household ; 7 and their language to the throne on all these occasions , though temperate and loyal , breathed a generous spirit of patriotism , evincing a perfect consciousness of their own rights , and a steady determination to maintain them . 8 Alas ! what could such resolution avail , in this season of misrule , against the intrigues of a cunning and profligate minister , unsupported too , as the commons were , by any sympathy or co-operation on the part of the higher orders of the state ! A scheme was devised for bringing the popular branch of the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminishing the number of its constituents . It has been already remarked , in the Introduction , that a great irregularity prevailed in Castile as to the number of cities which , at different times , exercised the right of representation . During the fourteenth century , the deputation from this order had been uncommonly full . The king , however , availing himself of this indeterminateness , caused writs to be issued to a very small proportion of the towns which had usually enjoyed the privilege . Some of those that were excluded indignantly though ineffectually remonstrated against this abuse . Others , previously despoiled of their possessions by the rapacity of the crown , or impoverished by the disastrous feuds into which the country had been thrown , acquiesced in the measure from motives of economy . From the same mistaken policy several cities , again , as Burgos , Toledo , and others , petitioned the sovereign to defray the charges of their representatives from the royal treasury ; a most ill-advised parsimony , which suggested to the crown a plausible pretext for the new system of exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notwithstanding its occasional fluctuations , had exhibited during the preceding century what might be regarded as a representation of the whole commonwealth , was gradually reduced , during the reigns of John the Second and his son Henry the Fourth , to the deputations of some seventeen or eighteen cities . And to this number , with slight variation , it has been restricted until the occurrence of the recent revolutionary movements in that kingdom . 9 The non-represented were required to transmit their instructions to the deputies of the privileged cities . Thus Salamanca appeared in behalf of five hundred towns and fourteen hundred villages ; and the populous province of Galicia was represented by the little town of Zamora , which is not even included within its geographical limits . 10 The privilege of a voice in cortes , as it was called , came at length to be prized so highly by the favored cities , that when , in 1506 , some of those which were excluded solicited the restitution of their ancient rights , their petition was opposed by the former on the impudent pretence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient law and usage to only eighteen cities of the realm . " 11 In this short-sighted and most unhappy policy , we see the operation of those local jealousies and estrangements , to which we have alluded in the Introduction . But , although the cortes , thus reduced in numbers , necessarily lost much of its weight , it still maintained a bold front against the usurpations of the crown . It does not appear , indeed , that any attempt was made under John the Second , or his successor , to corrupt its members , or to control the freedom of debate ; although such a proceeding is not improbable , as altogether conformable to their ordinary policy , and as the natural result of their preliminary measures . But , however true the deputies continued to themselves and to those who sent them , it is evident that so limited and partial a selection no longer afforded a representation of the interests of the whole country . Their necessarily imperfect acquaintance with the principles or even wishes of their widely scattered constituents , in an age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press , as in our day , must have left them oftentimes in painful uncertainty , and deprived them of the cheering support of public opinion . The voice of remonstrance , which derives such confidence from numbers , would hardly now be raised in their deserted halls with the same frequency or energy as before ; and , however the representatives of that day might maintain their integrity uncorrupted , yet , as every facility was afforded to the undue influence of the crown , the time might come when venality would prove stronger than principle , and the unworthy patriot be tempted to sacrifice his birthright for a mess of pottage . Thus early was the fair dawn of freedom overcast , which opened in Castile under more brilliant auspices , perhaps , than in any other country in Europe . While the reign of John the Second is so deservedly odious in a political view , in a literary , it may be inscribed with what Giovio calls " the golden pen of history . " It was an epoch in the Castilian , corresponding with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , distinguished not so much by any production of extraordinary genius , as by the effort made for the introduction of an elegant culture , by conducting it on more scientific principles than had been hitherto known . The early literature of Castile could boast of the " Poem of the Cid , " in some respects the most remarkable performance of the middle ages . It was enriched , moreover , with other elaborate compositions , displaying occasional glimpses of a buoyant fancy , or of sensibility to external beauty , to say nothing of those delightful romantic ballads , which seemed to spring up spontaneously in every quarter of the country , like the natural wild flowers of the soil . But the unaffected beauties of sentiment , which seem rather the result of accident than design , were dearly purchased , in the more extended pieces , at the expense of such a crude mass of grotesque and undigested verse , as shows an entire ignorance of the principles of the art . 12 The profession of letters itself was held in little repute by the higher orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning . While the nobles of the sister kingdom of Aragon , assembled in their poetic courts , in imitation of their Provencal neighbors , vied with each other in lays of love and chivalry , those of Castile disdained these effeminate pleasures as unworthy of the profession of arms , the only one of any estimation in their eyes . The benignant influence of John was perceptible in softening this ferocious temper . He was himself sufficiently accomplished , for a king ; and , notwithstanding his aversion to business , manifested , as has been noticed , a lively relish for intellectual enjoyment . He was fond of books , wrote and spoke Latin with facility , composed verses , and condescended occasionally to correct those of his loving subjects . 13 Whatever might be the value of his criticisms , that of his example can not be doubted . The courtiers , with the quick scent for their own interest which distinguished the tribe in every country , soon turned their attention to the same polite studies ; 14 and thus Castilian poetry received very early the courtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of its meridian glory . Among the most eminent of these noble savans , was Henry , marquis of Villena , descended from the royal houses of Castile and Aragon , 15 but more illustrious , as one of his countrymen has observed , by his talents and attainments , than by his birth . His whole life was consecrated to letters , and especially to the study of natural science . I am not aware that any specimen of his poetry , although much lauded by his contemporaries , 16 has come down to us. 17 He translated Dante 's " Commedia " into prose , and is said to have given the first example of a version of the AEneid into a modern language . 18 He labored assiduously to introduce a more cultivated taste among his countrymen , and his little treatise on the gaya sciencia , as the divine art was then called , in which he gives an historical and critical view of the poetical Consistory of Barcelona , is the first approximation , however faint , to an Art of Poetry in the Castilian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to science , and especially astronomy , to the utter neglect of his temporal concerns , led the wits of that day to remark , that " he knew much of heaven , and nothing of earth . " He paid the usual penalty of such indifference to worldly weal , by seeing himself eventually stripped of his lordly possessions , and reduced , at the close of life , to extreme poverty . 20 His secluded habits brought on him the appalling imputation of necromancy . A scene took place at his death , in 1434 , which is sufficiently characteristic of the age , and may possibly have suggested a similar adventure to Cervantes . The king commissioned his son 's preceptor , Brother Lope de Barrientos , afterwards bishop of Cuenca , to examine the valuable library of the deceased ; and the worthy ecclesiastic consigned more than a hundred volumes of it to the flames , as savoring too strongly of the black art . The Bachelor Cibdareal , the confidential physician of John the Second , in a lively letter on this occurrence to the poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fain get the reputation of saints , by making others necromancers ; " and requests his friend " to allow him to solicit , in his behalf , some of the surviving volumes from the king , that in this way the soul of Brother Lope might be saved from further sin , and the spirit of the defunct marquis consoled by the consciousness , that his books no longer rested on the shelves of the man who had converted him into a conjuror. " 21 John de Mena denounces this auto da fe of science in a similar , but graver tone of sarcasm , in his " Laberinto . " These liberal sentiments in the Spanish writers of the fifteenth century may put to shame the more bigoted criticism of the seventeenth . 22 Another of the illustrious wits of this reign was Inigo Lopez de Mendoza , marquis of Santillana , " the glory and delight of the Castilian nobility , " whose celebrity was such , that foreigners , it was said , journeyed to Spain from distant parts of Europe to see him . Although passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend the marquis of Villena , neglect his public or domestic duties for them . On the contrary , he discharged the most important civil and military functions . He made his house an academy , in which the young cavaliers of the court might practise the martial exercises of the age ; and he assembled around him at the same time men eminent for genius and science , whom he munificently recompensed , and encouraged by his example . 23 His own taste led him to poetry , of which he has left some elaborate specimens . They are chiefly of a moral and preceptive character ; but , although replete with noble sentiment , and finished in a style of literary excellence far more correct than that of the preceding age , they are too much infected with mythology and metaphorical affectations to suit the palate of the present day . He possessed , however , the soul of a poet ; and when he abandons himself to his native redondillas , delivers his sentiments with a sweetness and grace inimitable . To him is to be ascribed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Italian sonnet in Castile , which Boscan , many years later , claimed for himself with no small degree of self-congratulation . 24 His epistle on the primitive history of Spanish verse , although containing notices sufficiently curious from the age and the source whence they proceed , has perhaps done more service to letters by the valuable illustrations it has called forth from its learned editor . 25 This great man , who found so much leisure for the cultivation of letters amidst the busy strife of politics , closed his career at the age of sixty , in 1458 . Though a conspicuous actor in the revolutionary scenes of the period , he maintained a character for honor and purity of motive , unimpeached even by his enemies . The king , notwithstanding his devotion to the faction of his son Henry , conferred on him the dignities of count of Real de Manzanares and marquis of Santillana ; this being the oldest creation of a marquis in Castile , with the exception of Villena. 26 His eldest son was subsequently made duke of Infantado , by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present day . But the most conspicuous , for his poetical talents , of the brilliant circle which graced the court of John the Second , was John de Mena , a native of fair Cordova , " the flower of science and of chivalry , " 27 as he fondly styles her . Although born in a middling condition of life , with humble prospects , he was early smitten with a love of letters ; and , after passing through the usual course of discipline at Salamanca , he repaired to Rome , where , in the study of those immortal masters whose writings had but recently revealed the full capacities of a modern idiom , he imbibed principles of taste , which gave a direction to his own genius , and , in some degree , to that of his countrymen . On his return to Spain , his literary merit soon attracted general admiration , and introduced him to the patronage of the great , and above all to the friendship of the marquis of Santillana. 28 He was admitted into the private circle of the monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " used to have Mena 's verses lying on his table , as constantly as his prayer-book . " The poet repaid the debt of gratitude by administering a due quantity of honeyed rhyme , for which the royal palate seems to have possessed a more than ordinary relish . 29 He continued faithful to his master amidst all the fluctuations of faction , and survived him less than two years . He died in 1456 ; and his friend , the marquis of Santillana , raised a sumptuous monument over his remains , in commemoration of his virtues and of their mutual affection . John de Mena is affirmed by some of the national critics to have given a new aspect to Castilian poetry . 30 His great work was his " Laberinto , " the outlines of whose plan may faintly remind us of that portion of the " Divina Commedia " where Dante resigns himself to the guidance of Beatrice . In like manner the Spanish poet , under the escort of a beautiful personification of Providence , witnesses the apparition of the most eminent individuals , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wheel of destiny , they give occasion to some animated portraiture , and much dull , pedantic disquisition . In these delineations we now and then meet with a touch of his pencil , which , from its simplicity and vigor , may be called truly Dantesque . Indeed , the Castilian Muse never before ventured on so bold a flight ; and , notwithstanding the deformity of the general plan , the obsolete barbarisms of the phraseology , its quaintness and pedantry , notwithstanding the cantering dactylic measure in which it is composed , and which to the ear of a foreigner can scarcely be made tolerable , the work abounds in conceptions , nay in whole episodes , of such mingled energy and beauty , as indicate genius of the highest order . In some of his smaller pieces his style assumes a graceful flexibility , too generally denied to his more strained and elaborate efforts . 31 It will not be necessary to bring under review the minor luminaries of this period . Alfonso de Baena , a converted Jew , secretary of John the Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these ancient troubadours into a cancionero , " for the disport and divertisement of his highness the king , when he should find himself too sorely oppressed with cares of state , " a case we may imagine of no rare occurrence . The original manuscript of Baena , transcribed in beautiful characters of the fifteenth century , lies , or did lie until very lately , unheeded in the cemetery of the Escurial , with the dust of many a better worthy . 32 The extracts selected from it by Castro , although occasionally exhibiting some fluent graces with considerable variety of versification , convey , on the whole , no very high idea of taste or poetic talent . 33 . Indeed , this epoch , as before remarked , was not so much distinguished by uncommon displays of genius of Seville granting a hundred doblas of gold as the guerdon of a poet who had celebrated in some score of verses the glories of their native city ; and appropriating the same sum as an annual premium for a similar performance . 34 It is not often that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recompensed even by royal bounty . But the gifted spirits of that day mistook the road to immortality . Disdaining the untutored simplicity of their predecessors , they sought to rise above them by an ostentation of learning , as well as by a more classical idiom . In the latter particular they succeeded . They much improved the external forms of poetry , and their compositions exhibit a high degree of literary finish , compared with all that preceded them . But their happiest sentiments are frequently involved in such a cloud of metaphor , as to become nearly unintelligible ; while they invoke the pagan deities with a shameless prodigality that would scandalize even a French lyric . This cheap display of school-boy erudition , however it may have appalled their own age , has been a principal cause of their comparative oblivion with posterity . How far superior is one touch of nature , as the " Finojosa " or " Querella de Amor , " for example , of the marquis of Santillana , to all this farrago of metaphor and mythology ! The impulse , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature . Epistolary and historical composition were cultivated with considerable success . The latter , especially , might admit of advantageous comparison with that of any other country in Europe at the same period ; 35 and it is remarkable , that , after such early promise , the modern Spaniards have not been more successful in perfecting a classical prose style . Enough has been said to give an idea of the state of mental improvement in Castile under John the Second . The Muses , who had found a shelter in his court from the anarchy which reigned abroad , soon fled from its polluted precincts under the reign of his successor Henry the Fourth , whose sordid appetites were incapable of being elevated above the objects of the senses . If we have dwelt somewhat long on a more pleasing picture , it is because our road is now to lead us across a dreary waste exhibiting scarcely a vestige of civilization . While a small portion of the higher orders of the nation was thus endeavoring to forget the public calamities in the tranquillizing pursuit of letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , 36 the popular aversion for the minister Luna had been gradually infusing itself into the royal bosom . His too obvious assumption of superiority , even over the monarch who had raised him from the dust , was probably the real though secret cause of this disgust . But the habitual ascendency of the favorite over his master prevented the latter from disclosing this feeling until it was heightened by an occurrence which sets in a strong light the imbecility of the one and the presumption of the other . John , on the death of his wife , Maria of Aragon , had formed the design of connecting himself with a daughter of the king of France . But the constable , in the mean time , without even the privity of his master , entered into negotiations for his marriage with the princess Isabella , granddaughter of John the First of Portugal ; and the monarch , with an unprecedented degree of complaisance , acquiesced in an arrangement professedly repugnant to his own inclinations . 37 By one of those dispensations of Providence , however , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weakest , the column , which the minister had so artfully raised for his support , served only to crush him . The new queen , disgusted with his haughty bearing , and probably not much gratified with the subordinate situation to which he had reduced her husband , entered heartily into the feelings of the latter , and indeed contrived to extinguish whatever spark of latent affection for his ancient favorite lurked within his breast . John , yet fearing the overgrown power of the constable too much to encounter him openly , condescended to adopt the dastardly policy of Tiberius on a similar occasion , by caressing the man whom he designed to ruin , and he eventually obtained possession of his person , only by a violation of the royal safe-conduct . The constable 's trial was referred to a commission of jurists and privy counsellors , who , after a summary and informal investigation , pronounced on him the sentence of death on a specification of charges either general and indeterminate , or of the most trivial import . " If the king , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobles , who equally deserved it in those turbulent times , he would have had but few to reign over . " 38 The constable had supported his disgrace , from the first , with an equanimity not to have been expected from his elation in prosperity ; and he now received the tidings of his fate with a similar fortitude . As he rode along the streets to the place of execution , clad in the sable livery of an ordinary criminal , and deserted by those who had been reared by his bounty , the populace , who before called so loudly for his disgrace , struck with this astonishing reverse of his brilliant fortunes , were melted into tears . 39 They called to mind the numerous instances of his magnanimity . They reflected , that the ambitious schemes of his rivals had been not a whit less selfish , though less successful , than his own ; and that , if his cupidity appeared insatiable , he had dispensed the fruits of it in acts of princely munificence . He himself maintained a serene and even cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he bade him request the prince " to reward the attachment of his servants with a different guerdon from what his master had assigned to him . " As he ascended the scaffold , he surveyed the apparatus of death with composure , and calmly submitted himself to the stroke of the executioner , who , in the savage style of the executions of that day , plunged his knife into the throat of his victim , and deliberately severed his head from his body . A basin , for the reception of alms to defray the expenses of his interment , was placed at one extremity of the scaffold ; and his mutilated remains , after having been exposed for several days to the gaze of the populace , were removed , by the brethren of a charitable order , to a place called the hermitage of St. Andrew , appropriated as the cemetery for malefactors . 40 Such was the tragical end of Alvaro de Luna ; a man , who , for more than thirty years , controlled the counsels of the sovereign , or , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His fate furnishes one of the most memorable lessons in history . It was not lost on his contemporaries ; and the marquis of Santillana has made use of it to point the moral of perhaps the most pleasing of his didactic compositions . 41 John did not long survive his favorite 's death , which he was seen afterwards to lament even with tears . Indeed , during the whole of the trial he had exhibited the most pitiable agitation , having twice issued and recalled his orders countermanding the constable 's execution ; and , had it not been for the superior constancy , or vindictive temper of the queen , he would probably have yielded to these impulses of returning affection . 42 So far from deriving a wholesome warning from experience , John confided the entire direction of his kingdom to individuals not less interested , but possessed of far less enlarged capacities , than the former minister . Penetrated with remorse at the retrospect of his unprofitable life , and filled with melancholy presages of the future , the unhappy prince lamented to his faithful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been born the son of a mechanic , instead of king of Castile . " He died July 21st , 1454 , after a reign of eight and forty years , if reign it may be called , which was more properly one protracted minority . John left one child by his first wife , Henry , who succeeded him on the throne ; and by his second wife two others , Alfonso , then an infant , and Isabella , afterwards queen of Castile , the subject of the present narrative . She had scarcely reached her fourth year at the time of her father 's decease , having been born on the 22d of April , 1451 , at Madrigal . The king recommended his younger children to the especial care and protection of their brother Henry , and assigned the town of Cuellar , with its territory and a considerable sum of money , for the maintenance of the Infanta Isabella . 43 FOOTNOTES 1 Sempere y Guarinos , Historia del Luxo , y de las Leyes Suntuarias de Espana , ( Madrid , 1788 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III. , edicion de la Academia , ( Madrid , 1780 , ) passim .  --  Cronica de Juan II. , ( Valencia , 1779 , ) p. 6. 3 Cronica de Alvaro de Luna , edition de la Academia , ( Madrid , 1784 , ) tit. 3 , 5 , 68 , 74.  --  Guzman , Generaciones y Semblanzas , ( Madrid , 1775 , ) cap . 33 , 34.  --  Abarca , Reyes de Aragon , en Anales Historicos , ( Madrid , 1682 , ) tom . i. fol. 227.  --  Cronica de Juan II. , passim .  --  He possessed sixty towns and fortresses , and kept three thousand lances constantly in pay .

CONDITION OF ARAGON DURING THE MINORITY OF FERDINAND .  --  REIGN OF JOHN II. , OF ARAGON. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carlos .  --  Birth of Ferdinand .  - -  Insurrection of Catalonia.  --  Death of Carlos .  --  His Character .  --  Tragical Story of Blanche .  --  Young Ferdinand besieged by the Catalans.  --  Treaty between France and Aragon.  --  Distress and Embarrassments of John .  --  Siege and Surrender of Barcelona . We must now transport the reader to Aragon , in order to take a view of the extraordinary circumstances , which opened the way for Ferdinand 's succession in that kingdom . The throne , which had become vacant by the death of Martin , in 1410 , was awarded by the committee of judges to whom the nation had referred the great question of the succession , to Ferdinand , regent of Castile during the minority of his nephew , John the Second ; and thus the sceptre , after having for more than two centuries descended in the family of Barcelona , was transferred to the same bastard branch of Trastamara , that ruled over the Castilian monarchy . 1 Ferdinand the First was succeeded after a brief reign by his son Alfonso the Fifth , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which kingdom he acquired by his own prowess , and where he established his residence , attracted , no doubt , by the superior amenity of the climate and the higher intellectual culture , as well as the pliant temper of the people , far more grateful to the monarch than the sturdy independence of his own countrymen . During his long absence , the government of his hereditary domains devolved on his brother John , as his lieutenant-general in Aragon. 2 This prince had married Blanche , widow of Martin , king of Sicily , and daughter of Charles the Third , of Navarre . By her he had three children ; Carlos , prince of Viana ; 3 Blanche , married to and afterwards repudiated by Henry the Fourth , of Castile ; 4 and Eleanor , who espoused a French noble , Gaston , count of Foix . On the demise of the elder Blanche , the crown of Navarre rightfully belonged to her son , the prince of Viana , conformably to a stipulation in her marriage contract , that , on the event of her death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sons , female , should inherit the kingdom , to the exclusion of her husband . 5 This provision , which had been confirmed by her father , Charles the Third , in his testament , was also recognized in her own , accompanied however with a request , that her son Carlos , then twenty-one years of age , would , before assuming the sovereignty , solicit " the good will and approbation of his father . " 6 Whether this approbation was withheld , or whether it was ever solicited , does not appear . It seems probable , however , that Carlos , perceiving no disposition in his father to relinquish the rank and nominal title of king of Navarre , was willing he should retain them , so long as he himself should be allowed to exercise the actual rights of sovereignty ; which indeed he did , as lieutenant-general or governor of the kingdom , at the time of his mother 's decease , and for some years after . 7 In 1447 , John of Aragon contracted a second alliance with Joan Henriquez , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Don Frederic Henriquez , admiral of that kingdom ; 8 a woman considerably younger than himself , of consummate address , intrepid spirit , and unprincipled ambition . Some years after this union , John sent his wife into Navarre , with authority to divide with his son Carlos the administration of the government there . This encroachment on his rights , for such Carlos reasonably deemed it , was not mitigated by the deportment of the young queen , who displayed all the insolence of sudden elevation , and who from the first seems to have regarded the prince with the malevolent eye of a step-mother . Navarre was at that time divided by two potent factions , styled , from their ancient leaders , Beaumonts and Agramonts ; whose hostility , originating in a personal feud , had continued long after its original cause had become extinct . 9 The prince of Viana was intimately connected with some of the principal partisans of the Beaumont faction , who heightened by their suggestions the indignation to which his naturally gentle temper had been roused by the usurpation of Joan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in defiance of his father , the sovereignty which of right belonged to him . The emissaries of Castile , too , eagerly seized this occasion of retaliating on John his interference in the domestic concerns of that monarchy , by fanning the spark of discord into a flame . The Agramonts , on the other hand , induced rather by hostility to their political adversaries than to the prince of Viana , vehemently espoused the cause of the queen . In this revival of half-buried animosities , fresh causes of disgust were multiplied , and matters soon came to the worst extremity . The queen , who had retired to Estella , was besieged there by the forces of the prince . The king , her husband , on receiving intelligence of this , instantly marched to her relief ; and the father and son confronted each other at the head of their respective armies near the town of Aybar. 10 The unnatural position , in which they thus found themselves , seems to have sobered their minds , and to have opened the way to an accommodation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-smothered rancor of the ancient factions of Navarre thus brought in martial array against each other , refusing all control , precipitated them into an engagement . The royal forces were inferior in number , but superior in discipline , to those of the prince , who , after a well contested action , saw his own party entirely discomfited , and himself a prisoner . 11 Some months before this event , Queen Joan had been delivered of a son , afterwards so famous as Ferdinand the Catholic ; whose humble prospects , at the time of his birth , as a younger brother , afforded a striking contrast with the splendid destiny which eventually awaited him . This auspicious event occurred in the little town of Sos , in Aragon , on the 10th of March , 1452 ; and , as it was nearly contemporary with the capture of Constantinople , is regarded by Garibay to have been providentially assigned to this period , as affording , in a religious view , an ample counterpoise to the loss of the capital of Christendom . 12 The demonstrations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasion , contrasted strangely with the stern severity with which he continued to visit the offences of his elder offspring . It was not till after many months of captivity that the king , in deference to public opinion rather than the movements of his own heart , was induced to release his son , on conditions , however , so illiberal ( his indisputable claim to Navarre not being even touched upon ) as to afford no reasonable basis of reconciliation . The young prince accordingly , on his return to Navarre , became again involved in the factions which desolated that unhappy kingdom , and , after an ineffectual struggle against his enemies , resolved to seek an asylum at the court of his uncle Alfonso the Fifth , of Naples , and to refer to him the final arbitration of his differences with his father . 13 On his passage through France and the various courts of Italy , he was received with the attentions due to his rank , and still more to his personal character and misfortunes . Nor was he disappointed in the sympathy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Assured of protection from so high a quarter , Carlos might now reasonably flatter himself with the restitution of his legitimate rights , when these bright prospects were suddenly overcast by the death of Alfonso , who expired at Naples of a fever in the month of May , 1458 , bequeathing his hereditary dominions of Spain , Sicily , and Sardinia to his brother John , and his kingdom of Naples to his illegitimate son Ferdinand . 14 The frank and courteous manners of Carlos had won so powerfully on the affections of the Neapolitans , who distrusted the dark , ambiguous character of Ferdinand , Alfonso 's heir , that a large party eagerly pressed the prince to assert his title to the vacant throne , assuring him of a general support from the people . But Carlos , from motives of prudence or magnanimity , declined engaging in this new contest , 15 and passed over to Sicily , whence he resolved to solicit a final reconciliation with his father . He was received with much kindness by the Sicilians , who , preserving a grateful recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen of that island , readily transferred to the son their ancient attachment to the parent . An assembly of the states voted a liberal supply for his present exigencies , and even urged him , if we are to credit the Catalan ambassador at the court of Castile , to assume the sovereignty of the island . 16 Carlos , however , far from entertaining so rash an ambition , seems to have been willing to seclude himself from public observation . He passed the greater portion of his time at a convent of Benedictine friars not far from Messina , where , in the society of learned men , and with the facilities of an extensive library , he endeavored to recall the happier hours of youth in the pursuit of his favorite studies of philosophy and history . 17 In the mean while , John , now king of Aragon and its dependencies , alarmed by the reports of his son 's popularity in Sicily , became as solicitous for the security of his authority there , as he had before been for it in Navarre . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fairest professions , and to allure him back to Spain by the prospect of an effectual reconciliation . Carlos , believing what he most earnestly wished , in opposition to the advice of his Sicilian counsellors , embarked for Majorca , and , after some preliminary negotiations , crossed over to the coast of Barcelona . Postponing , for fear of giving offence to his father , his entrance into that city , which , indignant at his persecution , had made the most brilliant preparations for his reception , he proceeded to Igualada , where an interview took place between him and the king and queen , in which he conducted himself with unfeigned humility and penitence , reciprocated on their part by the most consummate dissimulation . 18 All parties now confided in the stability of a pacification so anxiously desired , and effected with such apparent cordiality . It was expected that John would hasten to acknowledge his son 's title as heir apparent to the crown of Aragon , and convene an assembly of the states to tender him the customary oath of allegiance . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed summoned the Aragonese cortes at Fraga for the purpose of receiving their homage to himself ; but he expressly refused their request touching a similar ceremony to the prince of Viana ; and he openly rebuked the Catalans for presuming to address him as the successor to the crown . 19 In this unnatural procedure it was easy to discern the influence of the queen . In addition to her original causes of aversion to Carlos , she regarded him with hatred as the insuperable obstacle to her own child Ferdinand 's advancement . Even the affection of John seemed to be now wholly transferred from the offspring of his first to that of his second marriage ; and , as the queen 's influence over him was unbounded , she found it easy by artful suggestions to put a dark construction on every action of Carlos , and to close up every avenue of returning affection within his bosom . Convinced at length of the hopeless alienation of his father , the prince of Viana turned his attention to other quarters , whence he might obtain support , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him on the part of Henry the Fourth , of Castile , for a union with his sister the princess Isabella . This was coming in direct collision with the favorite scheme of his parents . The marriage of Isabella with the young Ferdinand , which indeed , from the parity of their ages , was a much more suitable connection than that with Carlos , had long been the darling object of their policy , and they resolved to effect it in the face of every obstacle . In conformity with this purpose , John invited the prince of Viana to attend him at Lerida , where he was then holding the cortes of Catalonia . The latter fondly , and indeed foolishly , after his manifold experience to the contrary , confiding in the relenting disposition of his father , hastened to obey the summons , in expectation of being publicly acknowledged as his heir in the assembly of the states . After a brief interview he was arrested , and his person placed in strict confinement . 20 The intelligence of this perfidious procedure diffused general consternation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the queen and the vindictive temper of the king , not to feel the most serious apprehensions , not only for the liberty , but for the life of their prisoner . The cortes of Lerida , which , though dissolved on that very day , had not yet separated , sent an embassy to John , requesting to know the nature of the crimes imputed to his son . The permanent deputation of Aragon , and a delegation from the council of Barcelona , waited on him for a similar purpose , remonstrating at the same time against any violent and unconstitutional proceeding . To all these John returned a cold , evasive answer , darkly intimating a suspicion of conspiracy by his son against his life , and reserving to himself the punishment of the offense. 21 No sooner was the result of their mission communicated , than the whole kingdom was thrown into a ferment . The high-spirited Catalans rose in arms , almost to a man . The royal governor , after a fruitless attempt to escape , was seized and imprisoned in Barcelona . Troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers of the highest rank . The heated populace , outstripping the tardy movement of military operations , marched forward to Lerida in order to get possession of the royal person . The king , who had seasonable notice of this , displayed his wonted presence of mind . He ordered supper to be prepared for him at the usual hour , but , on the approach of night , made his escape on horseback with one or two attendants only , on the road to Fraga , a town within the territory of Aragon ; while the mob , traversing the streets of Lerida , and finding little resistance at the gate , burst into the palace and ransacked every corner of it , piercing , in their fury , even the curtains and beds with their swords and lances . 22 The Catalan army , ascertaining the route of the royal fugitive , marched directly on Fraga , and arrived so promptly that John , with his wife , and the deputies of the Aragonese cortes assembled there , had barely time to make their escape on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opposite quarter . The person of Carlos , in the mean time , was secured in the inaccessible fortress of Morella , situated in a mountainous district on the confines of Valencia . John , on halting at Saragossa , endeavored to assemble an Aragonese force capable of resisting the Catalan rebels . But the flame of insurrection had spread throughout Aragon , Valencia , and Navarre , and was speedily communicated to his transmarine possessions of Sardinia and Sicily . The king of Castile supported Carlos at the same time by an irruption into Navarre , and his partisans , the Beaumonts , co-operated with these movements by a descent on Aragon. 23 John , alarmed at the tempest which his precipitate conduct had roused , at length saw the necessity of releasing his prisoner ; and , as the queen had incurred general odium as the chief instigator of his persecution , he affected to do this in consequence of her interposition . As Carlos with his mother-in-law traversed the country on their way to Barcelona , he was everywhere greeted , by the inhabitants of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching enthusiasm . The queen , however , having been informed by the magistrates that her presence would not be permitted in the capital , deemed it prudent to remain at Villa Franca , about twenty miles distant ; while the prince , entering Barcelona , was welcomed with the triumphant acclamation due to a conqueror returning from a campaign of victories . 24 The conditions on which the Catalans proposed to resume their allegiance to their sovereign were sufficiently humiliating . They insisted not only on his public acknowledgment of Carlos as his rightful heir and successor , with the office , conferred on him for life , of lieutenant-general of Catalonia , but on an obligation on his own part , that he would never enter the province without their express permission . Such was John 's extremity , that he not only accepted these unpalatable conditions , but did it with affected cheerfulness . Fortune seemed now weary of persecution , and Carlos , happy in the attachment of a brave and powerful people , appeared at length to have reached a haven of permanent security . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , as some historians insinuate , of a disorder occasioned by poison administered during his imprisonment ; a fact , which , although unsupported by positive evidence , seems , notwithstanding its atrocity , to be no wise improbable , considering the character of the parties implicated . He expired on the 23d of September , 1461 , in the forty-first year of his age , bequeathing his title to the crown of Navarre , in conformity with the original marriage contract of his parents , to his sister Blanche and her posterity . 25 Thus in the prime of life , and at the moment when he seemed to have triumphed over the malice of his enemies , died the prince of Viana , whose character , conspicuous for many virtues , has become still more so for his misfortunes . His first act of rebellion , if such , considering his legitimate pretensions to the crown , it can be called , was severely requited by his subsequent calamities ; while the vindictive and persecuting temper of his parents excited a very general commiseration in his behalf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been derived from his own merits or the justice of his cause . The character of Don Carlos has been portrayed by Lucio Marineo , who , as he wrote an account of these transactions by the command of Ferdinand the Catholic , can not be suspected of any undue partiality in favor of the prince of Viana . " Such , " says he , " were his temperance and moderation , such the excellence of his breeding , the purity of his life , his liberality and munificence , and such the sweetness of his demeanor , that no one thing seemed to be wanting in him which belongs to a true and perfect prince . " 26 He is described by another contemporary , as " in person somewhat above the middle stature , having a thin visage , with a serene and modest expression of countenance , and withal somewhat inclined to melancholy . " 27 He was a considerable proficient in music , painting , and several mechanic arts . He frequently amused himself with poetical composition , and was the intimate friend of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was above all devoted to the study of philosophy and history . He made a version of Aristotle 's Ethics into the vernacular , which was first printed nearly fifty years after his death , at Saragossa , in 1509 . He compiled also a Chronicle of Navarre from the earliest period to his own times , which , although suffered to remain in manuscript , has been liberally used and cited by the Spanish antiquaries , Garibay , Blancas , and others . 28 His natural taste and his habits fitted him much better for the quiet enjoyment of letters , than for the tumultuous scenes in which it was his misfortune to be involved , and in which he was no match for enemies grown gray in the field and in the intrigues of the cabinet . But , if his devotion to learning , so rare in his own age , and so very rare among princes in any age , was unpropitious to his success on the busy theatre on which he was engaged , it must surely elevate his character in the estimation of an enlightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carlos . His sister Blanche , notwithstanding the inoffensive gentleness of her demeanor , had long been involved , by her adhesion to her unfortunate brother , in a similar proscription with him . The succession to Navarre having now devolved on her , she became tenfold an object of jealousy both to her father , the present possessor of that kingdom , and to her sister Eleanor , countess of Foix , to whom the reversion of it had been promised by John , on his own decease . The son of this lady , Gaston de Foix , had lately married a sister of Louis the Eleventh , of France ; and , in a treaty subsequently contracted between that monarch and the king of Aragon , it was stipulated that Blanche should be delivered into the custody of the countess of Foix , as surety for the succession of the latter , and of her posterity , to the crown of Navarre . 29 Conformably to this provision , John endeavored to persuade the princess Blanche to accompany him into France , under the pretext of forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke of Berri . The unfortunate lady , comprehending too well her father 's real purpose , besought him with the most piteous entreaties not to deliver her into the hands of her enemies ; but , closing his heart against all natural affection , he caused her to be torn from her residence at Olit , in the heart of her own dominions , and forcibly transported across the mountains into those of the count of Foix . On arriving at St. Jean Pied de Port , a little town on the French side of the Pyrenees , being convinced that she had nothing further to hope from human succor , she made a formal renunciation of her right to Navarre in favor of her cousin and former husband , Henry the Fourth , of Castile , who had uniformly supported the cause of her brother Carlos . Henry , though debased by sensual indulgence , was naturally of a gentle disposition , and had never treated her personally with unkindness . In a letter , which she now addressed to him , and which , says a Spanish historian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many years , without affecting the most insensible heart , 30 she reminded him of the dawn of happiness which she had enjoyed under his protection , of his early engagements to her , and of her subsequent calamities ; and , anticipating the gloomy destiny which awaited her , she settled on him her inheritance of Navarre , to the entire exclusion of her intended assassins , the count and countess of Foix. 31 On the same day , the last of April , she was delivered over to one of their emissaries , who conducted her to the castle of Ortes in Bearne , where , after languishing in dreadful suspense for nearly two years , she was poisoned by the command of her sister . 32 The retribution of Providence not unfrequently overtakes the guilty even in this world . The countess survived her father to reign in Navarre only three short weeks ; while the crown was ravished from her posterity for ever by that very Ferdinand , whose elevation had been the object to his parents of so much solicitude and so many crimes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customary oaths of allegiance , so pertinaciously withheld from that unfortunate prince , were tendered by the Aragonese deputation , at Calatayud , to his brother Ferdinand , then only ten years of age , as heir apparent of the monarchy ; after which he was conducted by his mother into Catalonia , in order to receive the more doubtful homage of that province . The extremities of Catalonia at this time seemed to be in perfect repose , but the capital was still agitated by secret discontent . The ghost of Carlos was seen stalking by night through the streets of Barcelona , bewailing in piteous accents his untimely end , and invoking vengeance on his unnatural murderers . The manifold miracles wrought at his tomb soon gained him the reputation of a saint , and his image received the devotional honors reserved for such as have been duly canonized by the church . 33 The revolutionary spirit of the Barcelonians , kept alive by the recollection of past injury , as well as by the apprehensions of future vengeance , should John succeed in reestablishing his authority over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose consummate address , however , had first accomplished the object of her visit , found it advisable to withdraw from the capital ; and she sought refuge , with her son and such few adherents as still remained faithful to them , in the fortified city of Gerona , about fifty miles north of Barcelona . Hither , however , she was speedily pursued by the Catalan militia , embodied under the command of their ancient leader Roger , count of Pallas , and eager to regain the prize which they had so inadvertently lost . The city was quickly entered , but the queen , with her handful of followers , had retreated to a tower belonging to the principal church in the place , which , as was very frequent in Spain , in those wild times , was so strongly fortified as to be capable of maintaining a formidable resistance . To oppose this , a wooden fortress of the same height was constructed by the assailants , and planted with lombards and other pieces of artillery then in use , which kept up an unintermitting discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalans also succeeded in running a mine beneath the fortress , through which a considerable body of troops penetrated into it , when , their premature cries of exultation having discovered them to the besieged , they were repulsed , after a desperate struggle , with great slaughter . The queen displayed the most intrepid spirit in the midst of these alarming scenes ; unappalled by the sense of her own danger and that of her child , and by the dismal lamentations of the females by whom she was surrounded , she visited every part of the works in person , cheering her defenders by her presence and dauntless resolution . Such were the stormy and disastrous scenes in which the youthful Ferdinand commenced a career , whose subsequent prosperity was destined to be checkered by scarcely a reverse of fortune . 35 In the mean while , John , having in vain attempted to penetrate through Catalonia to the relief of his wife , effected this by the co-operation of his French ally , Louis the Eleventh . That monarch , with his usual insidious policy , had covertly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , assuring the Catalans of his protection , should they still continue averse to a reconciliation with their own sovereign . These offers were but coldly received ; and Louis found it more for his interest to accept the propositions made to him by the king of Aragon himself , which subsequently led to most important consequences . By three several treaties , of the 3d , 21st , and 23d of May , 1462 , it was stipulated , that Louis should furnish his ally with seven hundred lances and a proportionate number of archers and artillery during the war with Barcelona , to be indemnified by the payment of two hundred thousand gold crowns within one year after the reduction of that city ; as security for which the counties of Roussillon and Cerdagne were pledged by John , with the cession of their revenues to the French king , until such time as the original debt should be redeemed . In this transaction both monarchs manifested their usual policy ; Louis believing that this temporary mortgage would become a permanent alienation , from John 's inability to discharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed , with more justice , that the aversion of the inhabitants to the dismemberment of their country from the Aragonese monarchy would baffle every attempt on the part of the French to occupy it permanently . 36 In pursuance of these arrangements , seven hundred French lances with a considerable body of archers and artillery 37 crossed the mountains , and , rapidly advancing on Gerona , compelled the insurgent army to raise the siege , and to decamp with such precipitation as to leave their cannon in the hands of the royalists . The Catalans now threw aside the thin veil , with which they had hitherto covered their proceedings . The authorities of the principality , established in Barcelona , publicly renounced their allegiance to King John and his son Ferdinand , and proclaimed them enemies of the republic . Writings at the same time were circulated , denouncing from scriptural authority , as well as natural reason , the doctrine of legitimacy in the broadest terms , and insisting that the Aragonese monarchs , far from being absolute , might be lawfully deposed for an infringement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonwealth , " it was said , " must always be considered paramount to that of the prince . " Extraordinary doctrines these for the age in which they were promulged , affording a still more extraordinary contrast with those which have been since familiar in that unhappy country ! 38 The government then enforced levies of all such as were above the age of fourteen , and , distrusting the sufficiency of its own resources , offered the sovereignty of the principality to Henry the Fourth , of Castile . The court of Aragon , however , had so successfully insinuated its influence into the council of this imbecile monarch , that he was not permitted to afford the Catalans any effectual support ; and , as he abandoned their cause altogether before the expiration of the year , 39 the crown was offered to Don Pedro , constable of Portugal , a descendant of the ancient house of Barcelona . In the mean while , the old king of Aragon , attended by his youthful son , had made himself master , with his characteristic activity , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 40 Cervera , Amposta , 41 Tortosa , and the most important places in the south of Catalonia . Many of these places were strongly fortified , and most of them defended with a resolution which cost the conqueror a prodigious sacrifice of time and money . John , like Philip of Macedon , made use of gold even more than arms , for the reduction of his enemies ; and , though he indulged in occasional acts of resentment , his general treatment of those who submitted was as liberal as it was politic . His competitor , Don Pedro , had brought little foreign aid to the support of his enterprise ; he had failed altogether in conciliating the attachment of his new subjects ; and , as the operations of the war had been conducted on his part in the most languid manner , the whole of the principality seemed destined soon to relapse under the dominion of its ancient master . At this juncture the Portuguese prince fell ill of a fever , of which he died on the 29th of June , 1466 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the war , proved ultimately the cause of its protraction. 42 It appeared , however , to present a favorable opportunity to John for opening a negotiation with the insurgents . But , so resolute were they in maintaining their independence , that the council of Barcelona condemned two of the principal citizens , suspected of defection from the cause , to be publicly executed ; it refused moreover to admit an envoy from the Aragonese cortes within the city , and caused the despatches , with which he was intrusted by that body , to be torn in pieces before his face . The Catalans then proceeded to elect Rene le Bon , as he was styled , of Anjou , to the vacant throne , brother of one of the original competitors for the crown of Aragon on the demise of Martin ; whose cognomen of " Good " is indicative of a sway far more salutary to his subjects than the more coveted and imposing title of Great . 43 This titular sovereign of half a dozen empires , in which he did not actually possess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume this perilous enterprise himself ; and he accordingly intrusted it to his son John , duke of Calabria and Lorraine , who , in his romantic expeditions in southern Italy , had acquired a reputation for courtesy and knightly prowess , inferior to none other of his time . 44 Crowds of adventurers flocked to the standard of a leader , whose ample inheritance of pretensions had made him familiar with war from his earliest boyhood ; and he soon found himself at the head of eight thousand effective troops . Louis the Eleventh , although not directly aiding his enterprise with supplies of men or money , was willing so far to countenance it , as to open a passage for him through the mountain fastnesses of Roussillon , then in his keeping , and thus enable him to descend with his whole army at once on the northern borders of Catalonia. 45 The king of Aragon could oppose no force capable of resisting this formidable army . His exchequer , always low , was completely exhausted by the extraordinary efforts , which he had made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either disgusted with the long protraction of the war , or from secret good-will to the enterprise of his feudal subject , withheld from King John the stipulated subsidies , the latter monarch found himself unable , with every expedient of loan and exaction , to raise sufficient money to pay his troops , or to supply his magazines . In addition to this , he was now involved in a dispute with the count and countess of Foix , who , eager to anticipate the possession of Navarre , which had been guaranteed to them on their father 's decease , threatened a similar rebellion , though on much less justifiable pretences , to that which he had just experienced from Don Carlos . To crown the whole of John 's calamities , his eyesight , which had been impaired by exposure and protracted sufferings during the winter siege of Amposta , now failed him altogether . 46 In this extremity , his intrepid wife , putting herself at the head of such forces as she could collect , passed by water to the eastern shores of Catalonia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enemy by the capture of several inferior places ; while Prince Ferdinand , effecting a junction with her before Gerona , compelled the duke of Lorraine to abandon the siege of that important city . Ferdinand 's ardor , however , had nearly proved fatal to him ; as , in an accidental encounter with a more numerous party of the enemy , his jaded horse would infallibly have betrayed him into their hands , had it not been for the devotion of his officers , several of whom , throwing themselves between him and his pursuers , enabled him to escape by the sacrifice of their own liberty . These ineffectual struggles could not turn the tide of fortune . The duke of Lorraine succeeded in this and the two following campaigns in making himself master of all the rich district of Ampurdan , northeast of Barcelona . In the capital itself , his truly princely qualities and his popular address secured him the most unbounded influence . Such was the enthusiasm for his person , that , when he rode abroad , the people thronged around him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even the animal himself , in their extravagance ; while the ladies , it is said , pawned their rings , necklaces , and other ornaments of their attire , in order to defray the expenses of the war . 47 King John , in the mean while , was draining the cup of bitterness to the dregs . In the winter of 1468 , his queen , Joan Henriquez , fell a victim to a painful disorder , which had been secretly corroding her constitution for a number of years . In many respects , she was the most remarkable woman of her time . She took an active part in the politics of her husband , and may be even said to have given them a direction . She conducted several important diplomatic negotiations to a happy issue , and , what was more uncommon in her sex , displayed considerable capacity for military affairs . Her persecution of her step-son , Carlos , has left a deep stain on her memory . It was the cause of all her husband 's subsequent misfortunes . Her invincible spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied him with the best means of surmounting many of the difficulties in which she had involved him , and her loss at this crisis seemed to leave him at once without solace or support . 48 At this period , he was further embarrassed , as will appear in the ensuing chapter , by negotiations for Ferdinand 's marriage , which was to deprive him , in a great measure , of his son 's co-operation in the struggle with his subjects , and which , as he lamented , while he had scarcely three hundred enriques in his coffers , called on him for additional disbursements . As the darkest hour , however , is commonly said to precede the dawning , so light now seemed to break upon the affairs of John . A physician in Lerida , of the Hebrew race , which monopolized at that time almost all the medical science in Spain , persuaded the king to submit to the then unusual operation of couching , and succeeded in restoring sight to one of his eyes . As the Jew , after the fashion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to operate on the other eye , since the planets , he said , wore a malignant aspect . But John 's rugged nature was insensible to the timorous superstitions of his age , and he compelled the physician to repeat his experiment , which in the end proved perfectly successful . Thus restored to his natural faculties , the octogenarian chief , for such he might now almost be called , regained his wonted elasticity , and prepared to resume offensive operations against the enemy with all his accustomed energy . 49 Heaven , too , as if taking compassion on his accumulated misfortunes , now removed the principal obstacle to his success by the death of the duke of Lorraine , who was summoned from the theatre of his short-lived triumphs on the 16th of December , 1469 . The Barcelonians were thrown into the greatest consternation by his death , imputed , as usual , though without apparent foundation , to poison ; and their respect for his memory was attested by the honors no less than royal , which they paid to his remains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his side , was paraded in solemn procession through the illuminated streets of the city , and , after lying nine days in state , was deposited amid the lamentations of the people in the sepulchre of the sovereigns of Catalonia. 50 As the father of the deceased prince was too old , and his children too young , to give effectual aid to their cause , the Catalans might be now said to be again without a leader . But their spirit was unbroken , and with the same resolution in which they refused submission more than two centuries after , in 1714 , when the combined forces of France and Spain were at the gates of the capital , they rejected the conciliatory advances made them anew by John . That monarch , however , having succeeded by extraordinary efforts in assembling a competent force , was proceeding with his usual alacrity in the reduction of such places in the eastern quarter of Catalonia as had revolted to the enemy , while at the same time he instituted a rigorous blockade of Barcelona by sea and land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expose so fair a city to the devastating horrors of a storm . The inhabitants made one vigorous effort in a sally against the royal forces ; but the civic militia were soon broken , and the loss of four thousand men , killed and prisoners , admonished them of their inability to cope with the veterans of Aragon. 51 At length , reduced to the last extremity , they consented to enter into negotiations , which were concluded by a treaty equally honorable to both parties . It was stipulated , that Barcelona should retain all its ancient privileges and rights of jurisdiction , and , with some exceptions , its large territorial possessions . A general amnesty was to be granted for offences . The foreign mercenaries were to be allowed to depart in safety ; and such of the natives , as should refuse to renew their allegiance to their ancient sovereign within a year , might have the liberty of removing with their effects wherever they would . One provision may be thought somewhat singular , after what had occurred ; it was agreed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout all his dominions , good , faithful , and loyal subjects ; which was accordingly done ! The king , after the adjustment of the preliminaries , " declining , " says a contemporary , " the triumphal car which had been prepared for him , made his entrance into the city by the gate of St. Anthony , mounted on a white charger ; and , as he rode along the principal streets , the sight of so many pallid countenances and emaciated figures , bespeaking the extremity of famine , smote his heart with sorrow . " He then proceeded to the hall of the great palace , and on the 22d of December , 1472 , solemnly swore there to respect the constitution and laws of Catalonia. 52 Thus ended this long , disastrous civil war , the fruit of parental injustice and oppression , which had nearly cost the king of Aragon the fairest portion of his dominions ; which devoted to disquietude and disappointment more than ten years of life , at a period when repose is most grateful ; and which opened the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark cloud over the evening of his days . It was attended , however , with one important result ; that of establishing Ferdinand 's succession over the whole of the domains of his ancestors .

REIGN OF HENRY IV. , OF CASTILE  --  CIVIL WAR .  --  MARRIAGE OF FERDINAND AND ISABELLA . 1454-1469 . Henry IV . disappoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nobles.  --  Extraordinary Scene at Avila.  --  Early Education of Isabella .  - -  Death of her Brother Alfonso .  --  Intestine Anarchy .  --  The Crown offered to Isabella .  --  She declines it .  --  Her Suitors .  --  She accepts Ferdinand of Aragon.  --  Marriage Articles .  --  Critical Situation of Isabella .  --  Ferdinand enters Castile .  --  Their Marriage . While these stormy events were occurring in Aragon , the Infanta Isabella , whose birth was mentioned at the close of the first chapter , was passing her youth amidst scenes scarcely less tumultuous . At the date of her birth , her prospect of succeeding to the throne of her ancestors was even more remote than Ferdinand 's prospect of inheriting that of his ; and it is interesting to observe through what trials , and by what a series of remarkable events , Providence was pleased to bring about this result , and through it the union , so long deferred , of the great Spanish monarchies . The accession of her elder brother , Henry the Fourth , was welcomed with an enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long-protracted and imbecile reign of his predecessor . Some few , indeed , who looked back to the time when he was arrayed in arms against his father , distrusted the soundness either of his principles or of his judgment . But far the larger portion of the nation was disposed to refer this to inexperience , or the ebullition of youthful spirit , and indulged the cheering anticipations which are usually entertained of a new reign and a young monarch . 1 Henry was distinguished by a benign temper , and by a condescension , which might be called familiarity , in his intercourse with his inferiors , virtues peculiarly engaging in persons of his elevated station ; and as vices , which wear the gloss of youth , are not only pardoned , but are oftentimes popular with the vulgar , the reckless extravagance in which he indulged himself was favorably contrasted with the severe parsimony of his father in his latter years , and gained him the surname of " the Liberal . " His treasurer having remonstrated with him on the prodigality of his expenditure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like private persons , are bound to dispense it for the happiness of their subjects . We must give to our enemies to make them friends , and to our friends to keep them so . " He suited the action so well to the word , that , in a few years , there was scarcely a mara-vedi remaining in the royal coffers . 2 He maintained greater state than was usual with the monarchs of Castile , keeping in pay a body-guard of thirty-six hundred lances , splendidly equipped , and officered by the sons of the nobility . He proclaimed a crusade against the Moors , a measure always popular in Castile ; assuming the pomegranate branch , the device of Granada , on his escutcheon , in token of his intention to extirpate the Moslems from the Peninsula . He assembled the chivalry of the remote provinces ; and , in the early part of his reign , scarce a year elapsed without one or more incursions into the hostile territory , with armies of thirty or forty thousand men . The results did not correspond with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often evaporated in a mere border foray , or in an empty gasconade under the walls of Granada . Orchards were cut down , harvests plundered , villages burnt to the ground , and all the other modes of annoyance peculiar to this barbarous warfare put in practice by the invading armies as they swept over the face of the country ; individual feats of prowess , too , commemorated in the romantic ballads of the time , were achieved ; but no victory was gained , no important post acquired . The king in vain excused his hasty retreats and abortive enterprises by saying , " that he prized the life of one of his soldiers more than those of a thousand Mussulmans . " His troops murmured at this timorous policy , and the people of the south , on whom the charges of the expeditions fell with peculiar heaviness , from their neighborhood to the scene of operations , complained that " the war was carried on against them , not against the infidel . " On one occasion an attempt was made to detain the king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces . So soon had the royal authority fallen into contempt ! The king of Granada himself , when summoned to pay tribute after a series of these ineffectual operations , replied " that , in the first years of Henry 's reign , he would have offered anything , even his children , to preserve peace to his dominions ; but now he would give nothing . " 3 The contempt , to which the king exposed himself by his public conduct , was still further heightened by his domestic . With even a greater indisposition to business , than was manifested by his father , 4 he possessed none of the cultivated tastes , which were the redeeming qualities of the latter . Having been addicted from his earliest youth to debauchery , when he had lost the powers , he retained all the relish , for the brutish pleasures of a voluptuary . He had repudiated his wife , Blanche of Aragon , after a union of twelve years , on grounds sufficiently ridiculous and humiliating . 5 In 1455 , he espoused Joanna , a Portuguese princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This lady , then in the bloom of youth , was possessed of personal graces , and a lively wit , which , say the historians , made her the delight of the court of Portugal . She was accompanied by a brilliant train of maidens , and her entrance into Castile was greeted by the festivities and military pageants , which belong to an age of chivalry . The light and lively manners of the young queen , however , which seemed to defy the formal etiquette of the Castilian court , gave occasion to the grossest suspicions . The tongue of scandal indicated Beltran de la Cueva , one of the handsomest cavaliers in the kingdom , and then newly risen in the royal graces , as the person to whom she most liberally dispensed her favors . This knight defended a passage of arms , in presence of the court , near Madrid , in which he maintained the superior beauty of his mistress , against all comers . The king was so much delighted with his prowess , that he commemorated the event by the erection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin for a religious institution . 6 The queen 's levity might have sought some justification in the unveiled licentiousness of her husband . One of the maids of honor , whom she brought in her train , acquired an ascendency over Henry , which he did not attempt to disguise ; and the palace , after the exhibition of the most disgraceful scenes , became divided by the factions of the hostile fair ones . The archbishop of Seville did not blush to espouse the cause of the paramour , who maintained a magnificence of state , which rivalled that of royalty itself . The public were still more scandalized by Henry 's sacrilegious intrusion of another of his mistresses into the post of abbess of a convent in Toledo , after the expulsion of her predecessor , a lady of noble rank and irreproachable character . 7 The stream of corruption soon finds its way from the higher to the more humble walks of life . The middling classes , imitating their superiors , indulged in an excess of luxury equally demoralizing , and ruinous to their fortunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we find the archbishop of St. James hunted from his see by the indignant populace in consequence of an outrage attempted on a youthful bride , as she was returning from church , after the performance of the nuptial ceremony . The rights of the people could be but little consulted , or cared for , in a court thus abandoned to unbounded license . Accordingly we find a repetition of most of the unconstitutional and oppressive acts which occurred under John the Second , of Castile ; attempts at arbitrary taxation , interference in the freedom of elections , and in the right exercised by the cities of nominating the commanders of such contingents of troops as they might contribute to the public defence . Their territories were repeatedly alienated , and , as well as the immense sums raised by the sale of papal indulgences for the prosecution of the Moorish war , were lavished on the royal satellites . 8 But , perhaps , the most crying evil of this period was the shameless adulteration of the coin . Instead of five royal mints , which formerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of authorized individuals , who debased the coin to such a deplorable extent , that the most common articles of life were enhanced in value three , four , and even six fold . Those who owed debts eagerly anticipated the season of payment ; and , as the creditors refused to accept it in the depreciated currency , it became a fruitful source of litigation and tumult , until the whole nation seemed on the verge of bankruptcy . In this general license , the right of the strongest was the only one which could make itself heard . The nobles , converting their castles into dens of robbers , plundered the property of the traveller , which was afterwards sold publicly in the cities . One of these robber chieftains , who held an important command on the frontiers of Murcia , was in the habit of carrying on an infamous traffic with the Moors by selling to them as slaves the Christian prisoners of either sex whom he had captured in his marauding expeditions . When subdued by Henry , after a sturdy resistance , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessions . The pusillanimous monarch knew neither when to pardon , nor when to punish . 9 But no part of Henry 's conduct gave such umbrage to his nobles , as the facility with which he resigned himself to the control of favorites , whom he had created as it were from nothing , and whom he advanced over the heads of the ancient aristocracy of the land . Among those especially disgusted by this proceeding Were Juan Pacheco , marquis of Villena , and Alfonso Carillo , archbishop of Toledo . These two personages exercised so important an influence over the destinies of Henry , as to deserve more particular notice . The former was of noble Portuguese extraction , and originally a page in the service of the constable Alvaro de Luna , by whom he had been introduced into the household of Prince Henry , during the lifetime of John the Second . His polished and plausible address soon acquired him a complete ascendency over the feeble mind of his master , who was guided by his pernicious counsels , in his frequent dissensions with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he recommended by his subtile , insinuating eloquence ; and he seemed to prefer the attainment of his purposes by a crooked rather than by a direct policy , even when the latter might equally well have answered . He sustained reverses with imperturbable composure ; and , when his schemes were most successful , he was willing to risk all for the excitement of a new revolution . Although naturally humane , and without violent or revengeful passions , his restless spirit was perpetually involving his country in all the disasters of civil war . He was created marquis of Villena , by John the Second ; and his ample domains , lying on the confines of Toledo , Murcia , and Valencia , and embracing an immense extent of populous and well-fortified territory , made him the most powerful vassal in the kingdom . 10 His uncle , the archbishop of Toledo , was of a sterner character . He was one of those turbulent prelates , not unfrequent in a rude age , who seem intended by nature for the camp rather than the church . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supported in the execution of his ambitious enterprises , no less by his undaunted resolution , than by the extraordinary resources , which he enjoyed as primate of Spain . He was capable of warm attachments , and of making great personal sacrifices for his friends , from whom , in return , he exacted the most implicit deference ; and , as he was both easily offended and implacable in his resentments , he seems to have been almost equally formidable as a friend and as an enemy . 11 These early adherents of Henry , little satisfied with seeing their own consequence eclipsed by the rising glories of the newly-created favorites , began secretly to stir up cabals and confederacies among the nobles , until the occurrence of other circumstances obviated the necessity , and indeed the possibility , of further dissimulation . Henry had been persuaded to take part in the internal dissensions which then agitated the kingdom of Aragon , and had supported the Catalans in their opposition to their sovereign by seasonable supplies of men and money . He had even made some considerable conquests for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the marquis of Villena and the archbishop of Toledo , to refer the arbitration of his differences with the king of Aragon to Louis the Eleventh , of France ; a monarch whose habitual policy allowed him to refuse no opportunity of interference in the concerns of his neighbors . The conferences were conducted at Bayonne , and an interview was subsequently agreed on between the kings of France and Castile , to be held near that city , on the banks of the Bidassoa , which divides the dominions of the respective monarchs . The contrast exhibited by the two princes at this interview , in their style of dress and equipage , was sufficiently striking to deserve notice . Louis , who was even worse attired than usual , according to Comines , wore a coat of coarse woollen cloth cut short , a fashion then deemed very unsuitable to persons of rank , with a doublet of fustian , and a weather-beaten hat , surmounted by a little leaden image of the Virgin . His imitative courtiers adopted a similar costume . The Castilians , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the royal favorite , Beltran de la Cueva , was resplendent with sails of cloth of gold , and his apparel glittered with a profusion of costly jewels . Henry was escorted by his Moorish guard gorgeously equipped , and the cavaliers of his train vied with each other in the sumptuous decorations of dress and equipage . The two nations appear to have been mutually disgusted with the contrast exhibited by their opposite affectations . The French sneered at the ostentation of the Spaniards , and the latter , in their turn , derided the sordid parsimony of their neighbors ; and thus the seeds of a national aversion were implanted , which , under the influence of more important circumstances , ripened into open hostility . 12 The monarchs seem to have separated with as little esteem for each other as did their respective courtiers ; and Comines profits by the occasion to inculcate the inexpediency of such interviews between princes , who have exchanged the careless jollity of youth for the cold and calculating policy of riper years . The award of Louis dissatisfied all parties ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , complained , that the marquis of Villena and the archbishop of Toledo had compromised the honor of the nation , by allowing their sovereign to cross over to the French shore of the Bidassoa , and its interests , by the cession of the conquered territory to Aragon . They loudly accused them of being pensioners of Louis , a fact which does not appear improbable , considering the usual policy of this prince , who , as is well known , maintained an espionage over the councils of most of his neighbors . Henry was so far convinced of the truth of these imputations , that he dismissed the obnoxious ministers from their employments . 13 The disgraced nobles instantly set about the organization of one of those formidable confederacies , which had so often shaken the monarchs of Castile upon their throne , and which , although not authorized by positive law , as in Aragon , seemed to have derived somewhat of a constitutional sanction from ancient usage . Some of the members of this coalition were doubtless influenced exclusively by personal jealousies ; but many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrary proceedings of the crown . In 1462 , the queen had been delivered of a daughter , who was named like herself Joanna , but who , from her reputed father , Beltran de la Cueva , was better known in the progress of her unfortunate history by the cognomen of Beltraneja . Henry , however , had required the usual oath of allegiance to be tendered to her as presumptive heir to the crown . The confederates , assembled at Burgos , declared this oath of fealty a compulsory act , and that many of them had privately protested against it at the time , from a conviction of the illegitimacy of Joanna . In the bill of grievances , which they now presented to the monarch , they required that he should deliver his brother Alfonso into their hands , to be publicly acknowledged as his successor ; they enumerated the manifold abuses , which pervaded every department of government , which they freely imputed to the unwholesome influence exercised by the favorite , Beltran de la Cueva , over the royal counsels , doubtless the true key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a covenant , sanctioned by all the solemnities of religion usual on these occasions , not to re-enter the service of their sovereign , or accept any favor from him until he had redressed their wrongs. 14 The king , who by an efficient policy might perhaps have crushed these revolutionary movements in their birth , was naturally averse to violent , or even vigorous measures . He replied to the bishop of Cuenca , his ancient preceptor , who recommended these measures ; " You priests , who are not called to engage in the fight , are very liberal of the blood of others . " To which the prelate rejoined , with more warmth than breeding , " Since you are not true to your own honor , at a time like this , I shall live to see you the most degraded monarch in Spain ; when you will repent too late this unseasonable pusillanimity. " 15 Henry , unmoved either by the entreaties or remonstrances of his adherents , resorted to the milder method of negotiation . He consented to an interview with the confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments of the marquis of Villena , to comply with most of their demands . He delivered his brother Alfonso into their hands , to be recognized as the lawful heir to the crown , on condition of his subsequent union with Joanna ; and he agreed to nominate , in conjunction with his opponents , a commission of five , who should deliberate on the state of the kingdom , and provide an effectual reform of abuses . 16 The result of this deliberation , however , proved so prejudicial to the royal authority , that the feeble monarch was easily persuaded to disavow the proceedings of the commissioners , on the ground of their secret collusion with his enemies , and even to attempt the seizure of their persons . The confederates , disgusted with this breach of faith , and in pursuance , perhaps , of their original design , instantly decided on the execution of that bold measure , which some writers denounce as a flagrant act of rebellion , and others vindicate as a just and constitutional proceeding . In an open plain , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be erected , of sufficient elevation to be easily seen from the surrounding country . A chair of state was placed on it , and in this was seated an effigy of King Henry , clad in sable robes and adorned with all the insignia of royalty , a sword at its side , a sceptre in its hand , and a crown upon its head . A manifesto was then read , exhibiting in glowing colors the tyrannical conduct of the king , and the consequent determination to depose him ; and vindicating the proceeding by several precedents drawn from the history of the monarchy . The archbishop of Toledo , then ascending the platform , tore the diadem from the head of the statue ; the marquis of Villena removed the sceptre , the count of Placencia the sword , the grand master of Alcantara and the counts of Benavente and Paredes the rest of the regal insignia ; when the image , thus despoiled of its honors , was rolled in the dust , amid the mingled groans and clamors of the spectators . The young prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was seated on the vacant throne , and the assembled grandees severally kissed his hand in token of their homage ; the trumpets announced the completion of the ceremony , and the populace greeted with joyful acclamations the accession of their new sovereign . 17 Such are the details of this extraordinary transaction , as recorded by the two contemporary historians of the rival factions . The tidings were borne , with the usual celerity of evil news , to the remotest parts of the kingdom . The pulpit and the forum resounded with the debates of disputants , who denied , or defended , the right of the subject to sit in judgment on the conduct of his sovereign . Every man was compelled to choose his side in this strange division of the kingdom . Henry received intelligence of the defection , successively , of the capital cities of Burgos , Toledo , Cordova , Seville , together with a large part of the southern provinces , where lay the estates of some of the most powerful partisans of the opposite faction . The unfortunate monarch , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expressed the extremity of his anguish in the strong language of Job : " Naked came I from my mother 's womb , and naked must I go down to the earth ! " 18 A large , probably the larger part of the nation , however , disapproved of the tumultuous proceedings of the confederates . However much they contemned the person of the monarch , they were not prepared to see the royal authority thus openly degraded . They indulged , too , some compassion for a prince , whose political vices , at least , were imputable to mental incapacity , and to evil counsellors , rather than to any natural turpitude of heart . Among the nobles who adhered to him , the most conspicuous were " the good count of Haro , " and the powerful family of Mendoza , the worthy scions of an illustrious stock . The estates of the marquis of Santillana , the head of this house , lay chiefly in the Asturias , and gave him a considerable influence in the northern provinces , 19 the majority of whose inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Henry 's summons , therefore , was issued for the attendance of all his loyal subjects capable of bearing arms , it was answered by a formidable array of numbers , that must have greatly exceeded that of his rival , and which is swelled by his biographer to seventy thousand foot and fourteen thousand horse ; a much smaller force , under the direction of an efficient leader , would doubtless have sufficed to extinguish the rising spirit of revolt . But Henry 's temper led him to adopt a more conciliatory policy , and to try what could be effected by negotiation , before resorting to arms . In the former , however , he was no match for the confederates , or rather the marquis of Villena , their representative on these occasions . This nobleman , who had so zealously co-operated with his party in conferring the title of king on Alfonso , had intended to reserve the authority to himself . He probably found more difficulty in controlling the operations of the jealous and aspiring aristocracy , with whom he was associated , than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite party in maintaining a sufficient degree of strength to form a counterpoise to that of the confederates , and thus , while he made his own services the more necessary to the latter , to provide a safe retreat for himself , in case of the shipwreck of their fortunes . 20 In conformity with this dubious policy , he had , soon after the occurrence at Avila , opened a secret correspondence with his former master , and suggested to him the idea of terminating their differences by some amicable adjustment . In consequence of these intimations , Henry consented to enter into a negotiation with the confederates ; and it was agreed , that the forces on both sides should be disbanded , and that a suspension of hostilities for six months should take place , during which some definitive and permanent scheme of reconciliation might be devised . Henry , in compliance with this arrangement , instantly disbanded his levies ; they retired overwhelmed with indignation at the conduct of their sovereign , who so readily relinquished the only means of redress that he possessed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since he was so ready to desert himself . 21 It would be an unprofitable task to attempt to unravel all the fine-spun intrigues , by which the marquis of Villena contrived to defeat every attempt at an ultimate accommodation between the parties , until he was very generally execrated as the real source of the disturbances in the kingdom . In the mean while , the singular spectacle was exhibited of two monarchs presiding over one nation , surrounded by their respective courts , administering the laws , convoking cortes , and in fine assuming the state and exercising all the functions of sovereignty . It was apparent that this state of things could not last long ; and that the political ferment , which now agitated the minds of men from one extremity of the kingdom to the other , and which occasionally displayed itself in tumults and acts of violence , would soon burst forth with all the horrors of a civil war . At this juncture , a proposition was made to Henry for detaching the powerful family of Pacheco from the interests of the confederates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother of the marquis of Villena , Don Pedro Giron , grand master of the order of Calatrava , a nobleman of aspiring views , and one of the most active partisans of his faction . The archbishop of Toledo would naturally follow the fortunes of his nephew , and thus the league , deprived of its principal supports , must soon crumble to pieces . Instead of resenting this proposal as an affront upon his honor , the abject mind of Henry was content to purchase repose even by the most humiliating sacrifice . He acceded to the conditions ; application was made to Rome for a dispensation from the vows of celibacy imposed on the grand master as the companion of a religious order ; and splendid preparations were instantly commenced for the approaching nuptials. 22 Isabella was then in her sixteenth year . On her father 's death , she retired with her mother to the little town of Arevalo , where , in seclusion , and far from the voice of flattery and falsehood , she had been permitted to unfold the natural graces of mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere of a court . Here , under the maternal eye , she was carefully instructed in those lessons of practical piety , and in the deep reverence for religion , which distinguished her maturer years . On the birth of the princess Joanna , she was removed , together with her brother Alfonso , by Henry to the royal palace , in order more effectually to discourage the formation of any faction adverse to the interests of his supposed daughter . In this abode of pleasure , surrounded by all the seductions most dazzling to youth , she did not forget the early lessons that she had imbibed ; and the blameless purity of her conduct shone with additional lustre amid the scenes of levity and licentiousness by which she was surrounded . 23 The near connection of Isabella with the crown , as well as her personal character , invited the application of numerous suitors . Her hand was first solicited for that very Ferdinand , who was destined to be her future husband , though not till after the intervention of many inauspicious circumstances . She was next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after his decease , when thirteen years of age , was promised by Henry to Alfonso , of Portugal . Isabella was present with her brother at a personal interview with that monarch in 1464 , but neither threats nor entreaties could induce her to accede to a union so unsuitable from the disparity of their years ; and with her characteristic discretion , even at this early age , she rested her refusal on the ground , that " the infantas of Castile could not be disposed of in marriage , without the consent of the nobles of the realm . " 25 When Isabella understood in what manner she was now to be sacrificed to the selfish policy of her brother , in the prosecution of which , compulsory measures if necessary were to be employed , she was filled with the liveliest emotions of grief and resentment . The master of Calatrava was well known as a fierce and turbulent leader of faction , and his private life was stained with most of the licentious vices of the age . He was even accused of having invaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by proposals of the most degrading nature , an outrage which the king had either not the power , or the inclination , to resent . 26 With this person , then , so inferior to her in birth , and so much more unworthy of her in every other point of view , Isabella was now to be united . On receiving the intelligence , she confined herself to her apartment , abstaining from all nourishment and sleep for a day and night , says a contemporary writer , and imploring Heaven , in the most piteous manner , to save her from this dishonor , by her own death or that of her enemy . As she was bewailing her hard fate to her faithful friend , Beatriz de Bobadilla , " God will not permit it , " exclaimed the high-spirited lady , " neither will I ; " then drawing forth a dagger from her bosom , which she kept there for the purpose , she solemnly vowed to plunge it in the heart of the master of Calatrava , as soon as he appeared ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a test . No sooner had the grand master received the bull of dispensation from the pope , than , resigning his dignities in his military order , he set about such sumptuous preparations for his wedding , as were due to the rank of his intended bride . When these were completed , he began his journey from his residence at Almagro to Madrid , where the nuptial ceremony was to be performed , attended by a splendid retinue of friends and followers . But , on the very first evening after his departure , he was attacked by an acute disorder while at Villarubia , a village not far from Ciudad Real , which terminated his life in four days . He died , says Palencia , with imprecations on his lips , because his life had not been spared some few weeks longer . 28 His death was attributed by many to poison , administered to him by some of the nobles , who were envious of his good fortune . But , notwithstanding the seasonableness of the event , and the familiarity of the crime in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pure fame of Isabella . 29 The death of the grand master dissipated , at a blow , all the fine schemes of the marquis of Villena , as well as every hope of reconciliation between the parties . The passions , which had been only smothered , now burst forth into open hostility ; and it was resolved to refer the decision of the question to the issue of a battle . The two armies met on the plains of Olmedo , where , two and twenty years before , John , the father of Henry , had been in like manner confronted by his insurgent subjects . The royal army was considerably the larger ; but the deficiency of numbers in the other was amply supplied by the intrepid spirit of its leaders . The archbishop of Toledo appeared at the head of its squadrons , conspicuous by a rich scarlet mantle , embroidered with a white cross , thrown over his armor . The young prince Alfonso , scarcely fourteen years of age , rode by his side , clad like him in complete mail . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beltran de la Cueva , then raised to the title of duke of Albuquerque , cautioning him not to venture in the field , as no less than forty cavaliers had sworn his death . The gallant nobleman , who , on this as on some other occasions , displayed a magnanimity which in some degree excused the partiality of his master , returned by the envoy a particular description of the dress he intended to wear ; a chivalrous defiance , which wellnigh cost him his life . Henry did not care to expose his person in the engagement , and , on receiving erroneous intelligence of the discomfiture of his party , retreated precipitately with some thirty or forty horsemen to the shelter of a neighboring village . The action lasted three hours , until the combatants were separated by the shades of evening , without either party having decidedly the advantage , although that of Henry retained possession of the field of battle . The archbishop of Toledo and Prince Alfonso were the last to retire ; and the former was seen repeatedly to rally his broken squadrons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lance early in the engagement . The king and the prelate may be thought to have exchanged characters in this tragedy . 30 The battle was attended with no result , except that of inspiring appetites , which had tasted of blood , with a relish for more unlicensed carnage . The most frightful anarchy now prevailed throughout the kingdom , dismembered by factions , which the extreme youth of one monarch and the imbecility of the other made it impossible to control . In vain did the papal legate , who had received a commission to that effect from his master , interpose his mediation , and even fulminate sentence of excommunication against the confederates . The independent barons plainly told him , that " those who advised the pope that he had a right to interfere in the temporal concerns of Castile deceived him ; and that they had a perfect right to depose their monarch on sufficient grounds , and should exercise it . " 31 Every city , nay , almost every family , became now divided within itself . In Seville and in Cordova , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another . The churches , which were fortified , and occupied with bodies of armed men , were many of them sacked and burnt to the ground . In Toledo no less than four thousand dwellings were consumed in one general conflagration . The ancient family feuds , as those between the great houses of Guzman and Ponce de Leon in Andalusia , being revived , carried new division into the cities , whose streets literally ran with blood . 32 In the country , the nobles and gentry , issuing from their castles , captured the defenceless traveller , who was obliged to redeem his liberty by the payment of a heavier ransom than was exacted even by the Mahometans . All communication on the high roads was suspended , and no man , says a contemporary , dared move abroad beyond the walls of his city , unless attended by an armed escort . The organization of one of those popular confederacies , known under the name of Hermandad , in 1465 , which continued in operation during the remainder of this gloomy period , brought some mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its functions , even against offenders of the highest rank , some of whose castles were razed to the ground by its orders . But this relief was only partial ; and the successful opposition , which the Hermandad sometimes encountered on these occasions , served to aggravate the horrors of the scene . Meanwhile , fearful omens , the usual accompaniments of such troubled times , were witnessed ; the heated imagination interpreted the ordinary operations of nature as signs of celestial wrath ; 33 and the minds of men were filled with dismal bodings of some inevitable evil , like that which overwhelmed the monarchy in the days of their Gothic ancestors . 34 At this crisis , a circumstance occurred , which gave a new face to affairs , and totally disconcerted the operations of the confederates . This was the loss of their young leader , Alfonso ; who was found dead in his bed , on the 5th of July , 1468 , at the village of Cardenosa , about two leagues from Avila , which had so recently been the theatre of his glory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper of that corrupt age , to poison , supposed to have been conveyed to him in a trout , on which he dined the day preceding . Others attributed it to the plague , which had followed in the train of evils , that desolated this unhappy country . Thus at the age of fifteen , and after a brief reign , if reign it may be called , of three years , perished this young prince , who , under happier auspices and in maturer life , might have ruled over his country with a wisdom equal to that of any of its monarchs . Even in the disadvantageous position , in which he had been placed , he gave clear indications of future excellence . A short time before his death , he was heard to remark , on witnessing the oppressive acts of some of the nobles , " I must endure this patiently , until I am a little older . " On another occasion , being solicited by the citizens of Toledo to approve of some act of extortion which they had committed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " And on being told that the city in that case would probably transfer its allegiance to Henry , he added , " Much as I love power , I am not willing to purchase it at such a price . " Noble sentiments , but not at all palatable to the grandees of his party , who saw with alarm that the young lion , when he had reached his strength , would be likely to burst the bonds with which they had enthralled him . 35 It is not easy to consider the reign of Alfonso in any other light , than that of a usurpation ; although some Spanish writers , and among the rest Marina , a competent critic when not blinded by prejudice , regard him as a rightful sovereign , and as such to be enrolled among the monarchs of Castile . 36 Marina , indeed , admits the ceremony at Avila to have been originally the work of a faction , and in itself informal and unconstitutional ; but he considers it to have received a legitimate sanction from its subsequent recognition by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deposition of Henry the Fourth was ever confirmed by an act of cortes . He still continued to reign with the consent of a large portion , probably the majority , of his subjects ; and it is evident that proceedings , so irregular as those at Avila , could have no pretence to constitutional validity , without a very general expression of approbation on the part of the nation . The leaders of the confederates were thrown into consternation by an event , which threatened to dissolve their league , and to leave them exposed to the resentment of an offended sovereign . In this conjuncture , they naturally turned their eyes on Isabella , whose dignified and commanding character might counterbalance the disadvantages arising from the unsuitableness of her sex for so perilous a situation , and justify her election in the eyes of the people . She had continued in the family of Henry during the greater part of the civil war ; until the occupation of Segovia by the insurgents , after the battle of Olmedo , enabled her to seek the protection of her younger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by her disgust with the license of a court , where the love of pleasure scorned even the veil of hypocrisy . On the death of her brother , she withdrew to a monastery at Avila , where she was visited by the archbishop of Toledo , who , in behalf of the confederates , requested her to occupy the station lately filled by Alfonso , and allow herself to be proclaimed queen of Castile . 37 Isabella discerned too clearly , however , the path of duty and probably of interest . She unhesitatingly refused the seductive proffer , and replied , that , " while her brother Henry lived , none other had a right to the crown ; that the country had been divided long enough under the rule of two contending monarchs ; and that the death of Alfonso might perhaps be interpreted into an indication from Heaven of its disapprobation of their cause . " She expressed herself desirous of establishing a reconciliation between the parties , and offered heartily to co-operate with her brother in the reformation of existing abuses . Neither the eloquence nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , when a deputation from Seville announced to her that that city , in common with the rest of Andalusia , had unfurled its standards in her name and proclaimed her sovereign of Castile , she still persisted in the same wise and temperate policy . 38 The confederates were not prepared for this magnanimous act from one so young , and in opposition to the advice of her most venerated counsellors . No alternative remained , however , but that of negotiating an accommodation on the best terms possible with Henry , whose facility of temper and love of repose naturally disposed him to an amicable adjustment of his differences . With these dispositions , a reconciliation was effected between the parties on the following conditions ; namely , that a general amnesty should be granted by the king for all past offences ; that the queen , whose dissolute conduct was admitted to be matter of notoriety , should be divorced from her husband , and sent back to Portugal ; that Isabella should have the principality of the Asturias ( the usual demesne of the heir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a specific provision suitable to her rank ; that she should be immediately recognized heir to the crowns of Castile and Leon ; that a cortes should be convoked within forty days for the purpose of bestowing a legal sanction on her title , as well as of reforming the various abuses of government ; and finally , that Isabella should not be constrained to marry in opposition to her own wishes , nor should she do so without the consent of her brother . 39 In pursuance of these arrangements , an interview took place between Henry and Isabella , each attended by a brilliant cortege of cavaliers and nobles , at a place called Toros de Guisando , in New Castile . 40 The monarch embraced his sister with the tenderest marks of affection , and then proceeded solemnly to recognize her as his future and rightful heir . An oath of allegiance was repeated by the attendant nobles , who concluded the ceremony by kissing the hand of the princess in token of their homage . In due time the representatives of the nation , convened in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these preliminary proceedings , and thus Isabella was announced to the world as the lawful successor to the crowns of Castile and Leon . 41 It can hardly be believed , that Henry was sincere in subscribing conditions so humiliating ; nor can his easy and lethargic temper account for his so readily relinquishing the pretensions of the Princess Joanna , whom , notwithstanding the popular imputations on her birth , he seems always to have cherished as his own offspring . He was accused , even while actually signing the treaty , of a secret collusion with the marquis of Villena for the purpose of evading it ; an accusation , which derives a plausible coloring from subsequent events . The new and legitimate basis , on which the pretensions of Isabella to the throne now rested , drew the attention of neighboring princes , who contended with each other for the honor of her hand . Among these suitors , was a brother of Edward the Fourth , of England , not improbably Richard , duke of Gloucester , since Clarence was then engaged in his intrigues with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his marriage with the daughter of that nobleman . Had she listened to his proposals , the duke would in all likelihood have exchanged his residence in England for Castile , where his ambition , satisfied with the certain reversion of a crown , might have been spared the commission of the catalogue of crimes which blacken his memory . 42 Another suitor was the duke of Guienne , the unfortunate brother of Louis the Eleventh , and at that time the presumptive heir of the French monarchy . Although the ancient intimacy , which subsisted between the royal families of France and Castile , in some measure favored his pretensions , the disadvantages resulting from such a union were too obvious to escape attention . The two countries were too remote from each other , 43 and their inhabitants too dissimiliar in character and institutions , to permit the idea of their ever cordially coalescing as one people under a common sovereign . Should the duke of Guienne fail in the inheritance of the crown , it was argued , he would be every way an unequal match for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might be feared , that , in case of a union , the smaller kingdom would be considered only as an appendage , and sacrificed to the interests of the larger . 44 The person on whom Isabella turned the most favorable eye was her kinsman Ferdinand of Aragon . The superior advantages of a connection , which should be the means of uniting the people of Aragon and Castile into one nation , were indeed manifest . They were the descendants of one common stock , speaking one language , and living under the influence of similar institutions , which had moulded them into a common resemblance of character and manners . From their geographical position , too , they seemed destined by nature to be one nation ; and , while separately they were condemned to the rank of petty and subordinate states , they might hope , when consolidated into one monarchy , to rise at once to the first class of European powers . While arguments of this public nature pressed on the mind of Isabella , she was not insensible to those which most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bloom of life , and distinguished for the comeliness of his person . In the busy scenes , in which he had been engaged from his boyhood , he had displayed a chivalrous valor , combined with maturity of judgment far above his years . Indeed , he was decidedly superior to his rivals in personal merit and attractions . 45 But , while private inclinations thus happily coincided with considerations of expediency for inclining her to prefer the Aragonese match , a scheme was devised in another quarter for the express purpose of defeating it . A fraction of the royal party , with the family of Mendoza at their head , had retired in disgust with the convention of Toros de Guisando , and openly espoused the cause of the princess Joanna . They even instructed her to institute an appeal before the tribunal of the supreme pontiff , and caused a placard , exhibiting a protest against the validity of the late proceedings , to be nailed secretly in the night to the gate of Isabella 's mansion . 46 Thus were sown the seeds of new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this disaffected party the marquis of Villena , who , since his reconciliation , had resumed his ancient ascendency over Henry , now associated himself . Nothing , in the opinion of this nobleman , could be more repugnant to his interests , than the projected union between the houses of Castile and Aragon ; to the latter of which , as already noticed , 47 once belonged the ample domains of his own marquisate , which he imagined would be held by a very precarious tenure should any of this family obtain a footing in Castile . In the hope of counteracting this project , he endeavored to revive the obsolete pretensions of Alfonso , king of Portugal ; and , the more effectually to secure the co-operation of Henry , he connected with his scheme a proposition for marrying his daughter Joanna with the son and heir of the Portuguese monarch ; and thus this unfortunate princess might be enabled to assume at once a station suitable to her birth , and at some future opportunity assert with success her claim to the Castilian crown . In furtherance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses to Isabella in a more public manner than he had hitherto done ; and a pompous embassy , with the archbishop of Lisbon at its head , appeared at Ocana , where Isabella was then residing , bearing the proposals of their master . The princess returned , as before , a decided though temperate refusal . 48 Henry , or rather the marquis of Villena , piqued at this opposition to his wishes , resolved to intimidate her into compliance ; and menaced her with imprisonment in the royal fortress at Madrid . Neither her tears nor entreaties would have availed against this tyrannical proceeding ; and the marquis was only deterred from putting it in execution by his fear of the inhabitants of Ocana , who openly espoused the cause of Isabella . Indeed , the common people of Castile very generally supported her in her preference of the Aragonese match . Boys paraded the streets , bearing banners emblazoned with the arms of Aragon , and singing verses prophetic of the glories of the auspicious union . They even assembled round the palace gates , and insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of satirical stanzas , which contrasted Alfonso 's years with the youthful graces of Ferdinand . 49 Notwithstanding this popular expression of opinion , however , the constancy of Isabella might at length have yielded to the importunity of her persecutors , had she not been encouraged by her friend , the archbishop of Toledo , who had warmly entered into the interests of Aragon , and who promised , should matters come to extremity , to march in person to her relief at the head of a sufficient force to insure it . Isabella , indignant at the oppressive treatment , which she experienced from her brother , as well as at his notorious infraction of almost every article in the treaty of Toros de Guisando , felt herself released from her corresponding engagements , and determined to conclude the negotiations relative to her marriage , without any further deference to his opinion . Before taking any decisive step , however , she was desirous of obtaining the concurrence of the leading nobles of her party . This was effected without difficulty , through the intervention of the archbishop of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Castile , and the maternal grandfather of Ferdinand ; a person of high consideration , both from his rank and character , and connected by blood with the principal families in the kingdom . 50 Fortified by their approbation , Isabella dismissed the Aragonese envoy with a favorable answer to his master 's suit . 51 Her reply was received with almost as much satisfaction by the old king of Aragon , John the Second , as by his son . This monarch , who was one of the shrewdest princes of his time , had always been deeply sensible of the importance of consolidating the scattered monarchies of Spain under one head . He had solicited the hand of Isabella for his son , when she possessed only a contingent reversion of the crown . But , when her succession had been settled on a more secure basis , he lost no time in effecting this favorite object of his policy . With the consent of the states , he had transferred to his son the title of king of Sicily , and associated him with himself in the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the eyes of his mistress . He then despatched a confidential agent into Castile , with instructions to gain over to his interests all who exercised any influence on the mind of the princess ; furnishing him for this purpose with cartes blanches , signed by himself and Ferdinand , which he was empowered to fill at his discretion . 52 Between parties thus favorably disposed , there was no unnecessary delay . The marriage articles were signed , and sworn to by Ferdinand at Cervera , on the 7th of January . He promised faithfully to respect the laws and usages of Castile ; to fix his residence in that kingdom , and not to quit it without the consent of Isabella ; to alienate no property belonging to the crown ; to prefer no foreigners to municipal offices , and indeed to make no appointments of a civil or military nature , without her consent and approbation ; and to resign to her exclusively the right of nomination to ecclesiastical benefices . All ordinances of a public nature were to be subscribed equally by both . Ferdinand engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to respect King Henry ; to suffer every noble to remain unmolested in the possession of his dignities , and not to demand restitution of the domains formerly owned by his father in Castile . The treaty concluded with a specification of a magnificent dower to be settled on Isabella , far more ample than that usually assigned to the queens of Aragon. 53 The circumspection of the framers of this instrument is apparent from the various provisions introduced into it solely to calm the apprehensions and to conciliate the good will of the party disaffected to the marriage ; while the national partialities of the Castilians in general were gratified by the jealous restrictions imposed on Ferdinand , and the relinquishment of all the essential rights of sovereignty to his consort . While these affairs were in progress , Isabella 's situation was becoming extremely critical . She had availed herself of the absence of her brother and the marquis of Villena in the south , whither they had gone for the purpose of suppressing the still lingering spark of insurrection , to transfer her residence from Ocana to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she intended to abide the issue of the pending negotiations with Aragon . Far , however , from escaping the vigilant eye of the marquis of Villena by this movement , she laid herself more open to it . She found the bishop of Burgos , the nephew of the marquis , stationed at Madrigal , who now served as an effectual spy upon her actions . Her most confidential servants were corrupted , and conveyed intelligence of her proceedings to her enemy . Alarmed at the actual progress made in the negotiations for her marriage , the marquis was now convinced that he could only hope to defeat them by resorting to the coercive system , which he had before abandoned . He accordingly instructed the archbishop of Seville to march at once to Madrigal with a sufficient force to secure Isabella 's person ; and letters were at the same time addressed by Henry to the citizens of that place , menacing them with his resentment , if they should presume to interpose in her behalf . The timid inhabitants disclosed the purport of the mandate to Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was perhaps the most critical period in her life . Betrayed by her own domestics , deserted even by those friends of her own sex who might have afforded her sympathy and counsel , but who fled affrighted from the scene of danger , and on the eve of falling into the snares of her enemies , she beheld the sudden extinction of those hopes , which she had so long and so fondly cherished . 54 In this exigency , she contrived to convey a knowledge of her situation to Admiral Henriquez , and the archbishop of Toledo . The active prelate , on receiving the summons , collected a body of horse , and , reinforced by the admiral 's troops , advanced with such expedition to Madrigal , that he succeeded in anticipating the arrival of the enemy . Isabella received her friends with unfeigned satisfaction ; and , bidding adieu to her dismayed guardian , the bishop of Burgos , and his attendants , she was borne off by her little army in a sort of military triumph to the friendly city of Valladolid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst of enthusiasm . 55 In the mean time Gutierre de Cardenas , one of the household of the princess , 56 and Alfonso de Palencia , the faithful chronicler of these events , were despatched into Aragon in order to quicken Ferdinand 's operations , during the auspicious interval afforded by the absence of Henry in Andalusia . On arriving at the frontier town of Osma , they were dismayed to find that the bishop of that place , together with the duke of Medina Celi , on whose active co-operation they had relied for the safe introduction of Ferdinand into Castile , had been gained over to the interests of the marquis of Villena. 57 The envoys , however , adroitly concealing the real object of their mission , were permitted to pass unmolested to Saragossa , where Ferdinand was then residing . They could not have arrived at a more inopportune season . The old king of Aragon was in the very heat of the war against the insurgent Catalans , headed by the victorious John of Anjou . Although so sorely pressed , his forces were on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maintain them . His exhausted treasury did not contain more than three hundred enriques . 58 In this exigency he was agitated by the most distressing doubts . As he could spare neither the funds nor the force necessary for covering his son 's entrance into Castile , he must either send him unprotected into a hostile country , already aware of his intended enterprise and in arms to defeat it , or abandon the long-cherished object of his policy , at the moment when his plans were ripe for execution . Unable to extricate himself from this dilemma , he referred the whole matter to Ferdinand and his council . 59 It was at length determined , that the prince should undertake the journey , accompanied by half a dozen attendants only , in the disguise of merchants , by the direct route from Saragossa ; while another party , in order to divert the attention of the Castilians , should proceed in a different direction , with all the ostentation of a public embassy from the king of Aragon to Henry the Fourth . The distance was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before reaching a place of safety ; but this intervening country was patrolled by squadrons of cavalry for the purpose of intercepting their progress ; and the whole extent of the frontier , from Almazan to Guadalajara , was defended by a line of fortified castles in the hands of the family of Mendoza. 60 The greatest circumspection therefore was necessary . The party journeyed chiefly in the night ; Ferdinand assumed the disguise of a servant , and , when they halted on the road , took care of the mules , and served his companions at table . In this guise , with no other disaster except that of leaving at an inn the purse which contained the funds for the expedition , they arrived , late on the second night , at a little place called the Burgo or Borough , of Osma , which the count of Trevino , one of the partisans of Isabella , had occupied with a considerable body of men-at-arms . On knocking at the gate , cold and faint with travelling , during which the prince had allowed himself to take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sentinel from the battlements , which , glancing near Ferdinand 's head , had wellnigh brought his romantic enterprise to a tragical conclusion ; when his voice was recognized by his friends within , and , the trumpets proclaiming his arrival , he was received with great joy and festivity by the count and his followers . The remainder of his journey , which he commenced before dawn , was performed under the convoy of a numerous and well-armed escort ; and on the 9th of October he reached Duenas in the kingdom of Leon , where the Castilian nobles and cavaliers of his party eagerly thronged to render him the homage due to his rank . 61 The intelligence of Ferdinand 's arrival diffused universal joy in the little court of Isabella at Valladolid . Her first step was to transmit a letter to her brother Henry , in which she informed him of the presence of the prince in his dominions , and of their intended marriage . She excused the course she had taken by the embarrassments , in which she had been involved by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the connection , and the sanction it had received from the Castilian nobles ; and she concluded with soliciting his approbation of it , giving him at the same time affectionate assurances of the most dutiful submission both on the part of Ferdinand and of herself . 62 Arrangements were then made for an interview between the royal pair , in which some courtly parasites would fain have persuaded their mistress to require some act of homage from Ferdinand ; in token of the inferiority of the crown of Aragon to that of Castile ; a proposition which she rejected with her usual discretion . 63 Agreeably to these arrangements , Ferdinand , on the evening of the 15th of October , passed privately from Duenas , accompanied only by four attendants , to the neighboring city of Valladolid , where he was received by the archbishop of Toledo , and conducted to the apartment of his mistress . 64 Ferdinand was at this time in the eighteenth year of his age . His complexion was fair , though somewhat bronzed by constant exposure to the sun ; his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to baldness . His muscular and well-proportioned frame was invigorated by the toils of war , and by the chivalrous exercises in which he delighted . He was one of the best horsemen in his court , and excelled in field sports of every kind . His voice was somewhat sharp , but he possessed a fluent eloquence ; and , when he had a point to carry , his address was courteous and even insinuating . He secured his health by extreme temperance in his diet , and by such habits of activity , that it was said he seemed to find repose in business . 65 Isabella was a year older than her lover . In stature she was somewhat above the middle size . Her complexion was fair ; her hair of a bright chestnut color , inclining to red ; and her mild blue eye beamed with intelligence and sensibility . She was exceedingly beautiful ; " the handsomest lady , " says one of her household , " whom I ever beheld , and the most gracious in her manners . " 66 The portrait still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an open symmetry of features , indicative of the natural serenity of temper , and that beautiful harmony of intellectual and moral qualities , which most distinguished her . She was dignified in her demeanor , and modest even to a degree of reserve . She spoke the Castilian language with more than usual elegance ; and early imbibed a relish for letters , in which she was superior to Ferdinand , whose education in this particular seems to have been neglected . 67 It is not easy to obtain a dispassionate portrait of Isabella . The Spaniards , who revert to her glorious reign , are so smitten with her moral perfections , that even in depicting her personal , they borrow somewhat of the exaggerated coloring of romance . The interview lasted more than two hours , when Ferdinand retired to his quarters at Duenas , as privately as he came . The preliminaries of the marriage , however , were first adjusted ; but so great was the poverty of the parties , that it was found necessary to borrow money to defray the expenses of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of a union destined to open the way to the highest prosperity and grandeur of the Spanish monarchy ! The marriage between Ferdinand and Isabella was publicly celebrated , on the morning of the 19th of October , in the palace of John de Vivero , the temporary residence of the princess , and subsequently appropriated to the chancery of Valladolid . The nuptials were solemnized in the presence of Ferdinand 's grandfather , the admiral of Castile , of the archbishop of Toledo , and a multitude of persons of rank , as well as of inferior condition , amounting in all to no less than two thousand . 69 A papal bull of dispensation was produced by the archbishop , relieving the parties from the impediment incurred by their falling within the prohibited degrees of consanguinity . This spurious document was afterwards discovered to have been devised by the old king of Aragon , Ferdinand , and the archbishop , who were deterred from applying to the court of Rome by the zeal with which it openly espoused the interests of Henry , and who knew that Isabella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the established church , and one which involved such heavy ecclesiastical censures . A genuine bull of dispensation was obtained , some years later , from Sixtus the Fourth ; but Isabella , whose honest mind abhorred everything like artifice , was filled with no little uneasiness and mortification at the discovery of the imposition . 70 The ensuing week was consumed in the usual festivities of this joyous season ; at the expiration of which , the new-married pair attended publicly the celebration of mass , agreeably to the usage of the time , in the collegiate church of Sante Maria . 71 An embassy was despatched by Ferdinand and Isabella to Henry , to acquaint him with their proceedings , and again request his approbation of them . They repeated their assurances of loyal submission , and accompanied the message with a copious extract from such of the articles of marriage , as , by their import , would be most likely to conciliate his favorable disposition . Henry coldly replied , that " he must advise with his ministers . " 72 * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quincuagenas " frequently cited in this History , was born at Madrid , in 1478 . He was of noble Asturian descent . Indeed , every peasant in the Asturias claims nobility as his birthright . At the age of twelve he was introduced into the royal palace , as one of the pages of Prince John . He continued with the court several years , and was present , though a boy , in the closing campaigns of the Moorish war . In 1514 , according to his own statement , he embarked for the Indies , where , although he revisited his native country several times , he continued during the remainder of his long life . The time of his death is uncertain . Oviedo occupied several important posts under the government , and he was appointed to one of a literary nature , for which he was well qualified by his long residence abroad ; that of historiographer of the Indies . It was in this capacity that he produced his principal work , " Historia General de las Indias , " in fifty books . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as full of lies , almost , as pages . " ( Oeuvres , trad . de Llorente , tom . i. p. 382 . ) But Las Casas entertained too hearty an aversion for the man , whom he publicly accused of rapacity and cruelty , and was too decidedly opposed to his ideas on the government of the Indies , to be a fair critic . Oviedo , though somewhat loose and rambling , possessed extensive stores of information , by which those who have had occasion to follow in his track have liberally profited . The work with which we are concerned is his Quincuagenas . It is entitled " Las Quincuagenas de los generosos e ilustres e no menos famosos Reyes , Principes , Duques , Marqueses y Condes et Caballeros , et Personas notables de Espana , que escribio el Capitan Gonzalo Fernandez de Oviedo y Valdez , Alcaide de sus Magestades de la Fortaleza de la Cibdad e Puerto de Sancto Domingo de la Isla Espaniola , Coronista de las Indias , " etc .

It contains a very full , and , indeed , prolix notice of the principal persons in Spain , their lineage , revenues , and arms , with an inexhaustible fund of private anecdote . The author , who was well acquainted with most of the individuals of note in his time , amused himself , during his absence in the New World , with keeping alive the images of home by this minute record of early reminiscences . In this mass of gossip , there is a good deal , indeed , of very little value . It contains , however , much for the illustration of domestic manners , and copious particulars , as I have intimated , respecting the characters and habits of eminent personages , which could have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics of descent and heraldry , he is uncommonly full ; and one would think his services in this department alone might have secured him , in a land where these are so much respected , the honors of the press .

Besides the three folio volumes in the Royal Library at Madrid , from which the transcript in my possession was obtained , Clemencin , whose commendations of this work , as illustrative of Isabella 's reign , are unqualified . ( Mem. de la Acad. de Hist. , tom . vi . Ilust. 10 , ) enumerates three others , two in the king 's private library , and one in that of the Academy .

( Reyes Catolicos , cap . 5 . ) And as Ferdinand and Isabella , in a letter addressed , after their marriage , to Henry IV. , transcribed also by Castillo , allude incidentally to such a recognition as to a well-known fact , the balance of testimony must be admitted to be in favor of it .

The marriage of Ferdinand and Isabella disconcerted the operations of the marquis of Villena , or , as he should be styled , the grand master of St. James , since he had resigned his marquisate to his elder son , on his appointment to the command of the military order above mentioned , a dignity inferior only to the primacy in importance . It was determined , however , in the councils of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those of Isabella ; and an embassy was gladly received from the king of France , offering to the former lady the hand of his brother the duke of Guienne , the rejected suitor of Isabella . Louis the Eleventh was willing to engage his relative in the unsettled politics of a distant state , in order to relieve himself from his pretensions at home . 1 An interview took place between Henry the Fourth and the French ambassadors in a little village in the vale of Lozoya , in October , 1470 . A proclamation was read , in which Henry declared his sister to have forfeited whatever claims she had derived from the treaty of Toros de Guisando , by marrying contrary to his approbation . He then with his queen swore to the legitimacy of the princess Joanna , and announced her as his true and lawful successor . The attendant nobles took the usual oaths of allegiance , and the ceremony was concluded by affiancing the princess , then in the ninth year of her age , with the formalities ordinarily practised on such occasions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duke of Guienne. 2 This farce , in which many of the actors were the same persons who performed the principal parts at the convention of Toros de Guisando , had on the whole an unfavorable influence on Isabella 's cause . It exhibited her rival to the world as one whose claims were to be supported by the whole authority of the court of Castile , with the probable co-operation of France . Many of the most considerable families in the kingdom , as the Pachecos , 3 the Mendozas in all their extensive ramifications , 4 the Zunigas , the Velascos , 5 the Pimentels , 6 unmindful of the homage so recently rendered to Isabella , now openly testified their adhesion to her niece . Ferdinand and his consort , who held their little court at Duenas , 8 were so poor as to be scarcely capable of defraying the ordinary charges of their table . The northern provinces of Biscay and Guipuscoa had , however , loudly declared against the French match ; and the populous province of Andalusia , with the house of Medina Sidonia at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her principal reliance was on the archbishop of Toledo , whose elevated station in the church and ample revenues gave him perhaps less real influence , than his commanding and resolute character , which had enabled him to triumph over every obstacle devised by his more crafty adversary , the grand master of St. James . The prelate , however , with all his generous self-devotion , was far from being a comfortable ally . He would willingly have raised Isabella to the throne , but he would have her indebted for her elevation exclusively to himself . He looked with a jealous eye on her most intimate friends , and complained that neither she nor her husband deferred sufficiently to his counsel . The princess could not always conceal her disgust at these humors , and Ferdinand , on one occasion , plainly told him that " he was not to be put in leading-strings , like so many of the sovereigns of Castile . " The old king of Aragon , alarmed at the consequences of a rupture with so indispensable an ally , wrote in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of propitiating the offended prelate . But Ferdinand , although educated in the school of dissimulation , had not yet acquired that self-command , which enabled him in after-life to sacrifice his passions , and sometimes indeed his principles , to his interests . 9 The most frightful anarchy at this period prevailed throughout Castile . While the court was abandoned to corrupt or frivolous pleasure , the administration of justice was neglected , until crimes were committed with a frequency and on a scale , which menaced the very foundations of society . The nobles conducted their personal feuds with an array of numbers which might compete with those of powerful princes . The duke of Infantado , the head of the house of Mendoza , 10 could bring into the field , at four and twenty hours ' notice one thousand lances and ten thousand foot . The battles , far from assuming the character of those waged by the Italian condottieri at this period , were of the most sanguinary and destructive kind . Andalusia was in particular the theatre of this savage warfare . The whole of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guzmans and Ponces de Leon . The chiefs of these ancient houses having recently died , the inheritance descended to young men , whose hot blood soon revived the feuds , which had been permitted to cool under the temperate sway of their fathers . One of these fiery cavaliers was Rodrigo Ponce de Leon , so deservedly celebrated afterwards in the wars of Granada as the marquis of Cadiz . He was an illegitimate and younger son of the count of Arcos , but was preferred by his father to his other children in consequence of the extraordinary qualities which he evinced at a very early period . He served his apprenticeship to the art of war in the campaigns against the Moors , displaying on several occasions an uncommon degree of enterprise and personal heroism . On succeeding to his paternal honors , his haughty spirit , impatient of a rival , led him to revive the old feud with the duke of Medina Sidonia , the head of the Guzmans , who , though the most powerful nobleman in Andalusia , was far his inferior in capacity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medina Sidonia mustered an army of twenty thousand men against his antagonist ; on another , no less than fifteen hundred houses of the Ponce faction were burnt to the ground in Seville . Such were the potent engines employed by these petty sovereigns in their conflicts with one another , and such the havoc which they brought on the fairest portion of the Peninsula . The husbandman , stripped of his harvest and driven from his fields , abandoned himself to idleness , or sought subsistence by plunder . A scarcity ensued in the years 1472 and 1473 , in which the prices of the most necessary commodities rose to such an exorbitant height , as put them beyond the reach of any but the affluent . But it would be wearisome to go into all the loathsome details of wretchedness and crime brought on this unhappy country by an imbecile government and a disputed succession , and which are portrayed with lively fidelity in the chronicles , the letters , and the satires of the time . 12 While Ferdinand 's presence was more than ever necessary to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was unexpectedly summoned into Aragon to the assistance of his father . No sooner had Barcelona submitted to King John , as mentioned in a preceding chapter , 13 than the inhabitants of Roussillon and Cerdagne , which provinces , it will be remembered , were placed in the custody of France , as a guaranty for the king of Aragon 's engagements , oppressed by the grievous exactions of their new rulers , determined to break the yoke , and to put themselves again under the protection of their ancient master , provided they could obtain his support . The opportunity was favorable . A large part of the garrisons in the principal cities had been withdrawn by Louis the Eleventh , to cover the frontier on the side of Burgundy and Brittany . John , therefore , gladly embraced the proposal , and on a concerted day a simultaneous insurrection took place throughout the provinces , when such of the French , in the principal towns , as had not the good fortune to escape into the citadels , were indiscriminately massacred . Of all the country , Salces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of the French . John then threw himself into the last-named city with a small body of forces , and instantly set about the construction of works to protect the inhabitants against the fire of the French garrison in the castle , as well as from the army which might soon be expected to besiege them from without . 14 Louis the Eleventh , deeply incensed at the defection of his new subjects , ordered the most formidable preparations for the siege of their capital . John 's officers , alarmed at these preparations , besought him not to expose his person at his advanced age to the perils of a siege and of captivity . But the lion-hearted monarch saw the necessity of animating the spirits of the besieged by his own presence ; and , assembling the inhabitants in one of the churches of the city , he exhorted them resolutely to stand to their defence , and made a solemn oath to abide the issue with them to the last . Louis , in the mean while , had convoked the ban and arriere-ban of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chivalry and feudal militia amounting , according to the Spanish historians , to thirty thousand men . With these ample forces , his lieutenant-general , the duke of Savoy , closely invested Perpignan ; and , as he was provided with a numerous train of battering artillery , instantly opened a heavy fire on the inhabitants . John , thus exposed to the double fire of the fortress and the besiegers , was in a very critical situation . Far from being disheartened , however , he was seen , armed cap-a-pie , on horseback from dawn till evening , rallying the spirits of his troops , and always present at the point of danger . He succeeded perfectly in communicating his own enthusiasm to the soldiers . The French garrison were defeated in several sorties , and their governor taken prisoner ; while supplies were introduced into the city in the very face of the blockading army . 15 Ferdinand , on receiving intelligence of his father 's perilous situation , instantly resolved , by Isabella 's advice , to march to his relief . Putting himself at the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the archbishop of Toledo and his friends , he passed into Aragon , where he was speedily joined by the principal nobility of the kingdom , and an army amounting in all to thirteen hundred lances and seven thousand infantry . With this corps he rapidly descended the Pyrenees , by the way of Mancanara , in the face of a driving tempest , which concealed him for some time from the view of the enemy . The latter , during their protracted operations , for nearly three months , had sustained a serious diminution of numbers in their repeated skirmishes with the besieged , and still more from an epidemic which broke out in their camp . They also began to suffer not a little from want of provisions . At this crisis , the apparition of this new army , thus unexpectedly descending on their rear , filled them with such consternation , that they raised the siege at once , setting fire to their tents , and retreating with such precipitation as to leave most of the sick and wounded a prey to the devouring element . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the head of his little band , to greet his deliverers ; and , after an affecting interview in the presence of the two armies , the father and son returned in triumph into Perpignan . 16 The French army , reinforced by command of Louis , made a second ineffectual attempt ( their own writers call it only a feint ) upon the city ; and the campaign was finally concluded by a treaty between the two monarchs , in which it was arranged , that the king of Aragon should disburse within the year the sum originally stipulated for the services rendered him by Louis in his late war with his Catalan subjects ; and that , in case of failure , the provinces of Roussillon and Cerdagne should be permanently ceded to the French crown . The commanders of the fortified places in the contested territory , selected by one monarch from the nominations of the other , were excused during the interim from obedience to the mandates of either ; at least so far as they might contravene their reciprocal engagements . 17 There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
