ART . IX . - Sermons preached in the Chapel of Harvard College . By JAMES WALKER , D. D. Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1861. l2mo. pp. 397 . WE sometimes encounter in persons of strong religious sensibilities an indifference to preaching , which , so far as it reaches , tends to justify itself by discouraging careful and diligent preparation for the pulpit . This indifference often assumes - and we doubt not sincerely - a highly devotional aspect . It is frequently asserted , as a propositioii which in order to be received needs only to be stated , that the legitimate purpose of a religious assembly is not the listening to instruction , but the collective offering of praise and prayer ; and at the same time it is taken for granted that the supreme importance attached in some quarters to the sermon indicates a very low type of spirituality . We are disposed to join issue with those who occupy this ground , and to deny that in a just scale of values worship takes precedence of preaching . Were we to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Testament , the verdict would unquestionably be on our side . It was for the purpose of preaching that the Founder of our religion ordained his twelve apostles and his seventy disciples , and this office occupies the chief place in his parting charge . Throughout the Acts of the Apostles we read constantly of preaching , while there is only the most cursory reference to any social expression of faith and piety . The apostolic Epistles recognize preaching as the one instrumentality of Divine appointment and of paramount efficacy for the salvation of men and the growth of the Church . In St. Paul 's charges to Timothy and Titus , rules are given for their preaching , but none for their conducting the worship of a Christian assembly . In fine , he who should approach the inquiry without preconceived opinions could not fail of the conclusion , that , in the esteem of the sacred writers , the setting forth of the facts , truths , and promises of the Gospel was the chief office of the Christian minister and the chief purpose for which an assembly was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best only a secondary and auxiliary place . // We should reach the same result by an analysis of the several parts of the public service . Preaching is the only part that really demands a peculiar order of office-bearers in the Church , or presupposes a gathering larger than a single household . Prayer and praise are individual acts , and are intimate and fervent in the precise degree in which the individual can isolate himself , and be conscious of no presence but that of the Omnipresent . Every devout soul ha* its petitions and thanksgivings which the voice of another can not offer , its conflicts , doubts , and fears , in which it must " tread the wine-press alone . " Next , in point of iiiterest , solemnity , and fervor , to secret prayer , come the services of domestic worship , in which a close community of experiences and of interests may render the devotional words uttered by one member of the family the approximate , though never the adequate , expression of what all feel , or ought to feel . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience , which often most need to be upborne in entreaty or in gratitude to the soul 's Author and Father , must be precluded and ignored ; the worshipper can not individualize himself , and must frequently find the very themes which press with the most anxious weight upon his own thoughts wholly unrecognized . And even were public devotion all that heart could wish , it ueeds not a separate profession in order to its edifying performance . If it flow from the heart and in the words of him who conducts it , there are in every congregation persons as pure as the minister in life and character , and therefore as unlikely as he to degrade the service by unworthy associations with its leader , and not Unfrequently there are parishioners whose devotional utterance is more free , glowing , and edifying than their pastor 's . Or if forms of prayer be used , they may be read as reverently and as acceptably by a layman as by a clergyman . Preaching , on the other hand , demands the assembly . It is not perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of individual receptivity and edification is in proportion to the number of worshippers . It is intrinsically a social , a public exercise . It requires , too , a separate order of men for its adequate and profitable performance . It demands intellect* ual discipline and preparation , close study of the Scriptures , // logical acumen , and rhetorical skill ; and it needs , for the religious criticism of life , that the critic stand somewhat aside from the areiia of business and conflict , where he can take clearer views and present more impartial estimates of the ordinary objects and modes of human endeavor and activity than if he were himself involved in the m*l6e , and drawn with the multitude in the chase . Preaching also has a more universal adaptation than worship . In the latter only the devout join ; while the former is addressed to all , and especially to those who bear no part in the prayer . This distinction holds good , wherever what calls itself prayer deserves the name . We know very well that exhortation , rebuke , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are designed for the congregation ; but this is an irreverent perversion and abuse , rather than a legitimate mode of worship . When properly conducted , public prayer at the most recognizes and expresses the degree of devout feeling already existing in the assembly ; and its duly calm , simple , and solemn utterance , while it tends to intensify , does not strongly tend to diffuse that feeling . But the sermon has for its aim that those who come to scoff may remain to pray , as well as that those whose religious character is already formed may grow in goodness . Preaching , also , is the only service that is peculiar to public worship . Prayer belongs everywhere , and is always appropriate . " Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs " go up with as rich an unction from the family circle as from church or cathedral . At the same time , the devoting of only one or two hours each week to these duties would be equivalent to their entire i*eglect . But preaching has no other appropriate place or time than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need that its occasions be multiplied ; for the hearers may gain in a single half-hour thoughts worth the meditation of a week and the embodiment of a life . Could preaching become daily , or could anything like preaching obtrude itself upon secular occasions , it would lose more in impressiveness than it could gain by its increased copiousness of opportunity and utterance . Experience confirms the views we have now expressed . // There never has been a time when the offices of devotion have languished in the Church , or have lacked a rich apparatus of holy words and imposing ceremonies . On the other hand , the forms of worship have in numerous instances been the most gorgeous and impressive where the religious sentiment has been the least fervent , penetrating , and pervading . But wherever religion has had a feeble hold on the practical conviction of men , preaching has either gone out of use , or has become jejune , formal , and vapid . In the early days of the Church , preaching , as we have seen , was the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lustre of primitive piety waxed dim . It revived with the dawn of the Reformation . It has preceded and accompanied every great awakening of the religious world . Luther and Melancthon , Wickliffe and Latimer , were the most pungent and powerful of preachers . In more recent times , every movement in the direction of vital Christianity , every marked reform in doctrine and in life , has been heralded by its company of earnest , efficient preachers . The liturgy of the Church of England comprises forms of devotion immeasurably loftier , more adequate , more comprehensive , than could be furnished except by the accumulated piety of ages . Yet it had been used , with all the accessory beauty of holiness , for centuries , and meanwhile the nation had been sinking into spiritual lethargy , indifference , and scepticism , until the preaching of Whitefield and Wesley inaugurated an era of truer faith and more fervent piety . In our own day , the sermon is deemed of the highest importance in precisely those quarters of the Church where there is the greatest amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to preaching is very apt to be found in close covenant with those forms of worldliness , selfishness , and fashionable dissipation , which involve no open immorality , but would find themselves condemned by a pulpit true to its mission . Probably in no portion of Christendom has the sermon been held in so high esteem as in New England , * and certainly nowhere else is there so general a recognition of the truth and * What we say of New England is equally applicable to other portions of the country , that have derived from New England the controlling elements of their population and character . // need and power of Christianity . We say this with a profound and sad confession of degeneracy from the ancestral type of piety , and of the prevalence in certain quarters of a latitudinarianism which can hardly be discriminated from infidelity . Yet even by those who will not yield to it , Christianity is recognized as a force , and of those who disbelieve it , the greater part have too strong a reverence for it to assume toward it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people than in any other district of Protestant Christendom find in the religion of the New Testament truths which they desire to understand , and precepts which they mean to obey . Therefore is it that preaching is here regarded as the prime function of the clerical office , that the ability to preach well is the first desideratum in a pastor , and that in the public estimation the clergy take rank mainly in the ratio of their capacity and success as preachers . Moreover , in all denominations among us , it is the most believing and serious congregations that still regard the sermon as the central object of interest in the public service , and look on with distrust while the substitutes for it which are proposed from time to time gain brief and limited favor . In accordance with this condition of the public mind , the sermon holds a higher place in our literature than in the literature of any other people . We are by no means vain of American authorsbip , and have often recognized the justice of our severe Transatlantic critics , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermons hold the first place in our prose literature , and in this department - in this alone - we are disposed to claim precedence of our contemporaries in the Old World . The best English sermons fall below our best in freedom and breadth of thought , in directness , in fervor , and in adaptation to the general mind and conscience , - while among the most popular English preachers there are those whose windy declamation would find no favor among intelligent American hearers and readers . Dr. Cumming would have here a very restricted reputation , and Spurgeon 's coarseness and irreverence would here repel alike the cultivated and the devout , both of which classes are said to be largely represented in his audiences . The sermons of the most distinguished // German divines are rhapsodies , with but a slender substratum of thought , and are immeasurably inferior to their other theological writings . The great living Protestant preachers in France surpass all others in method , in brilliant rhetoric , and in range of illustration and ornament ; but their sermons are addressed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , and are better adapted to awaken admiration than to produce conviction . The free church of Scotland alone , whose preachers have been nurtured under the voluntary system , and are prized for the spiritual results consequent on their labors , produces sermons that occupy , with reference to the religious needs of the humaii heart , the plane on which the American pulpit stands ; but the Scotch sermon is apt to be redundant in verbiage , and deficient in point of pure literary taste . With those who have heard Dr. Walker preach , we hesitate not to say that the first feeling in reading his sermons is disappointment in missing all that they owed to his revered presence and his living voice . With none of the arts of oratory or the conventional attributes of a great orator , he is impressive in his delivery almost beyond precedent . Every look and utterance denotes on his part profound conviction , - a mind thoroughly imbued , identified with the truths he preaches . He speaks not with the glow of one who is setting forth fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervor of one who is drawing from the depths of long experience , exhibiting the constituent elements of his own inward life , proclaiming truths that lie in his mind as axioms , beyond controversy , above the province of reasoning . There is always a felt void , and perhaps never more than in this very instance , when one whom all trust , love , and honor , and who*has been wont to speak to the ear , first addresses the same or like words to the eye alone . There is yet another disappointment . Dr. Walker 's style has seemed to his hearers more copious and fluent than his readers find it . With his slow and measured utterance , we have failed to estimate his severe conciseness ; and with the blended dignity and grace of his delivery , we have not known how little he was indebted to rhetorical ornament . But his // diction is not rich . His command of language is feeble as compared with the range and magnitude of the thoughts to which he gives expression . Of the arts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commonplace original , he is wholly innocent , He employs metaphors only when their obviousness and directness make them seem literal , comparisons only when they offer the shortest and easiest route to the mind or heart of his hearer or reader . He has nothing of the kaleidoscopic faculty , by which a thought is presented in successive views , each time with a new cluster of accessory images . What he says he says once for all , in the simplest form in which it cami be uttered , and then with a new sentence proceeds to another definite stage in the development of his subject . In every sermon he has a distinct aim , and that an aim always momentous as regards the body of Christian truth or the necessities of those to whom it is addressed . But if in the steps of his demonstration , or in preparing the way for his appeal , there is familiar ground to be passed over , he makes no attempt to hide the triteness , baldness , bareness of his statements , - nay , rather prefers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind or heart of his hearer on from what he admits as of course and of necessity , to what it is of vital importance that he be made to infer , believe , or feel . But the reader who has sustained this double disappointment is destined to be a third time disappointed , to his joy and gratitude , in the wealth of weighty thought , cogent motive , and profound spiritual wisdom with which this volume is replete . Those who heard these very sermons were not aware how much there was in them , how they would grow on reperusal , how irresistible they were in argument , how forceful in appeal , how sure and deep in insight , how just and wise in the criticism of human character , how surcharged with the spirit of serene reverence and devotion . They are less productions than revelations of the author 's mind and heart , and it is with them as with every manifestation of character , - their contents are not taken in at first sight ; they have a reserve which invites and rewards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest merits of these sermons that they are precisely what they purport to be , - not disquisitions , nor // orations , nor essays , - not such displays of learning or of dialectic skill as would be appropriate and welcome under any other name ,  --  but simply sermones , talks , in a style adequate to the subject , - talks about religious truth and duty , expressly designed and adapted to enlighten , convince , persuade , - to commend Christianity to loving reverence and implicit obedience . There is no room for inferring any collateral purpose with this . On the other hand , we are often struck with the author 's self-denying reticency on subjects lying just outside of his track , on which he would have spoken wisely and well , but not without digression from his directly religious purpose . There is often the clearest indication of an affluent mind in the choice from among all others of the one instance or example which best illustrates the proposition under treatment ; but the preacher gives no hint of the instances or examples that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the right one was chosen . Often , too , the subject is one which could have been mastered only by an extensive survey of details , the trial of successive hypotheses , and the careful discrimination between coincidence and correlation ; yet of all this we see not the process , but only the results , in generalizations so complete and exhaustive as to indicate the thoroughness with which they were made . We might refer , in verification of these remarks , to the sermon on " The Alleged Infidelity of Great Men . " The subject in almost any other hands would branch off into biographical memoranda , the discussion of individual cases of infidelity , and the array over against them of illustrious names identified with Christian faith . Dr. Walker , on the other hand , cites very few names , whether of friend or foe . Some of those few . are the very ones which a school-boy would have brought forward , and which one who had before his eyes the fear of being commonplace would have omitted to mention ; others are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various reading ; but there is not one of them for which , where it stands , we could substitute another equally appropriate name . Then , too , when we have finished the sermon , though we have listened in vain for the roll-call , we find that the great men themselves have heard it , have been quietly marshalled into voL. xclv. - No. 194. // their ranks , and have found their respective classes , - workers , thinkers , believers , sceptics , mistaken , mistaking , - and that there is no possible relation in which they can stand to Christianity , which is not specified and accounted for . Very much the same statement might be made as to the sermon entitled " Religion as affected by the Progress of the Physical Sciences . " In this , very little of the ground covered by the title is referred to in detail ; but the general principles established by the preacher comprehend the entire circle of relations between science and religion , and we doubt whether any intelligent person who had read the discourse could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as directly and of necessity its ally . We have referred to two sermons on subjects peculiarly appropriate to a University audience . There are several others in the volume which would have lost something of their aptness , if they had been preached before an ordinary congregation . But by far the larger number of these discourses have nothing either in subject or in treatment which would mark the place where they were delivered . We have such subjects as The Mediator , ' ' * Sins of Omission , ** No Hiding-Place for the Wicked , " " The Day of Judgment , " and numerous others which belong to the rudiments of personal religion and practical piety . Nor does the author deem it needful to discuss these themes with any parade of dialectics or of scholarship , but he proceeds in the simple , downright way in which he would urge essential truth or incumbent duty on any class of hearers that understood the power of words . In this we can not but recognize Dr. Walker 's wisdom and sagacity . One of the great lessons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions of men to the law and the judgment of God ; and this lesson is blurred and mutilated when the preacher holds back from any the plainest , most direct and home-coming utterances on duty , sin , accountableness , and retribution . Moreover , we are very certain that this style of preaching is nowhere more acceptable than among persons of the highest cultivation , and within the precincts of our literary institutions ; while those who fail to edify such audiences are those who , in the consciousness that they are // addressing scholars , forget that they are still more addressing sinners , dying men , invited heirs of immortality . One striking characteristic of this volume is its conversatism as regards both ethics and theology . Says one of its critics : " Not a word is said , or a thought hinted , that could in any way unsettle the belief , or disturb the feeling , of those who rely most intimately on external authority , or cling most closely to the old symbols of faith . " The critic adds : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ( a university audience , ) " and for the best influence on most Christian congregations , this is right . " It is right , we believe , because in accordance with the truth . But does the writer mean to intimate that it is useful to " most Christian congregations , " and to young men in college , to inculcate a reliance on false authority , or adherence to false beliefs ? Is the old a more wholesome pabulum than the true for our religious assemblies ? Or are the future scholars of our land to be trained in dogmas which they will outgrow , and learn to despise ? And is the head of a university to be praised for teaching what he is too wise to believe ? Or , to go further , has the Author of truth and the Creator of man so ill adapted the human mind and soul to the realities of the spiritual universe , that man is more benefited by ignorance than by knowledge of those realities ? Nay , does not the admission that the postulates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian congregations " and the proper development of character , betray a tacit consciousness that those postulates are baseless assumptions ? Did we suppose that Dr. Walker admitted the distinction between the esoteric and exoteric , and presented in these discourses other views of truth than those attested by his own consciousness , so far should we be from commending this volume , that there would be no limit to our indignation at such a grave and solemn imposture . But believing , as we do , that our author speaks on these subjects from his own mature conviction and experience , we are profoundly grateful to him for his testimony to the worth , sanctity , and power of verities which have stood the test of the Christian ages , and which are now assailed by no arguments that have not been met and refuted in past centuries , many of them , indeed , by the earli // est defenders of the faith , some of them by the recorded words of the Saviour and his immediate followers . In an age when the spasmodic in literature , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radical in morals , the audacious , irreverent , and destructive in theology , finds extensive currency and wins large applause , we feel by no means sure that this volume will " enjoy immediate popularity , " or will " do justice to the author 's reputation . " But if not , it can afford to wait . It will outlast much that will have noisy welcome and diffuse panegyric . It will edify serious minds , confirm the faith of those whose prayer is " Increase my faith , " awaken manly religious purpose , form the characters of ingenuous youth , and illustrate the perfect harmony of the highest style of intellect with the repose of pious trust on the testimony of God-inspired Scripture . We rejoice that these Sermons have been given to the world . They are a worthy memorial of the author 's unsurpassed ability , skill , and fidelity as a religious teacher , and especially of his fitness for the place he has so honorably filled as the head of an institution inalienably consecrated " to Christ and the Church .
