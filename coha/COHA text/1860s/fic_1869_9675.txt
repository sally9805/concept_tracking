Jemmy ; come , let 's go down to old Rogers , and help him to get in his wood . You know how old he is , and he ca n't do much  --  let 's go down and help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's too hard work getting in wood ; besides , I 'd rather sit still than work , any time . SAMUEL .  --  Yes , but you know that the more you sit still , the more we want to ; and if we never stir our stumps , we shall never get to be anything in the world . For my part , I want to be somebody , and I mean to be . Come ! come along ; let 's go and help the old man . JAMES .  --  No , I ca n't I do n't want to help other folks . It 's as much as I can do to help myself ; besides , I 've got lots of work to do at home  --  wood to split and coal to sift , and and all sorts of things . You may go if you 're a mind to , but I sha n't . SAMUEL .  --  Well , Jemmy , if you 've got work to do of your own , I wo n't urge you ; but I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do . I should n't think that was the way to get work done up . JAMES .  --  Oh , well ; I do n't like to work . I wish there was n't any such thing as work . This pushing , and pulling , and working , and studying , ai nt the thing I like ; besides , I never can make anything go . My wood is always full of knots , and I can never find the axe when I want it ; and if I try to dig in the garden , it 's always full of stones and old roots ; and I ai nt agoing to trouble myself about work , now I tell ye . SAMUEL .  --  Well , Jemmy , I ca n't stop to talk with you now , for we boys are going to form a Try Company , and after that we shall get in old Roger 's wood for him . I think the best thing you can do will be to join us , and see if you ca n't wake up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem like play . You 'd better believe that 's a good deal pleasanter than ' t is to lounge round all day , and say , I ca n't work , and I do n't want to do this and that . Here come the boys , now  --  some of the wide-awake ones . Enter Hiram and William with sashes on . HIRAM.  --  Hallo ! Sam ; I 'm glad you 're on hand so early , and Jim , too  --  I did n't expect to see him here ; but if he 's going to break up his old grumbling habits and join our Try Company , I 'm glad to have him  --  the more the merrier , you know . JAMES .  --  Oh , you need n't trouble yourself about me , Hiram ; I 've no notion of joining your Try Company . What 's the use of trying , when there 's so many things to do that a fellow ca n't count ' em ? I 'm just agoing to let everything slide , and I guess it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  I guess it wo n't be all the same a hundred years from now , James ; for you know the more a man does for himself , the more he is able to do ; and if his strength is increased by labor , so is his happiness increased as the fruit of his labor . Besides we have n't got to do everything at once . If we look at all kinds of work at once , it may seem hard . You know when they were building the big chimney over at the glass house , the masons laid only one brick at a time , and it was n't long before the whole were laid . A man ca n't jump over a mountain , but if he keeps on , taking one step at a time , he will soon get over it . So I 've made up my mind to belong to the Try Company , and if I ca n't do everything at once , I 'll just do one thing at a time , and so in time I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Well , Sam , you know you 're to be corporal : now what 's the order of the day ? SAMUEL .  --  Well , we must have material to form a company out of , so I 've appointed John Green and William Brown recruiting officers , and they are to be here with all the boys they can gather , at 3 o'clock , and it 's time for them now . Hark ! do n't you hear them coming ? Enter fourteen boys , two with sashes . Corporal Try puts on his sash . JOHN GREEN .  --  Corporal Try , we have brought to you these boys , who wish to be enrolled as members of your Try Company . I did not happen to have a copy of the rules with me , but if you will read them I think they will all agree to them , for they are boys of the right stamp . SAMUEL .  --  Well , boys , I 'm glad to have so large an addition to our number , for I hope we shall encourage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our rules to you . BROWN .  --  Takes the book , and reads . Rule 1st . When we have anything to do that we ought to do , never say , I CA N'T . Rule 2nd . When we have any thing to do that we ought to do , always say , I 'LL TRY . Rule 3rd . When we have anything to do that we ought to do , always do it before play . Rule 4th . Never do what we are satisfied we ought not to do . Rule 5th . Never ask anybody else to do what we can do ourselves as well as not . Rule 6th . Never put off till to-morrow what we can do to-day . These are our particular rules ; but besides these , we have a noble swarm of " Bees , " which we call our general rules . They are as follows : Be gentle , Be kind , Be courteous , Be truthful , Be honest , Be diligent . SAMUEL .  --  Now , if you agree to these rules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these names on the record . Hiram takes his seat , as Orderly , and the boys call their names in order , as follows : 1 . Archippus Akenside. 2 . Barzillai Brighthopes. 3 . Chalcedon Champney. 4 . Didymus Dotheboy. 5 . Entychus Entwistle. 6 . Frederic Filchnothing. 7 . Gregory Gregorson. 8 . Hogarth Harkaway. 9 . Ichabod Ireson. 10 . Jonathan Jenkinson. 11 . Kirk Kickman. 12 . Lysander Littleton . SAMUEL .  --  You may now assume the badge of our Company , passes the badges to each , and form a line to receive some visitors that I see approaching . Boys hang their badges on their sash . Enter five large girls , with a banner. 1st girl .  --  Corporal Try : The young ladies have felt a desire to encourage you in your enterprise , and have therefore prepared a banner , and delegated us to present it to you . I do not know how to make a speech , and so I will tell you a story , and then we will all , if you please , join in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead :  --  " Farmer Jones had a large field , which he ploughed and planted with corn , and cultivated with great care , hoping to find from it a good support for his family . But after all his work , the corn began to wither and droop for want of rain . He felt very sad and every day he went over and looked at it , and then looked up to see if there was no hope of rain . One day , as he stood looking up , and almost in despair , two little raindrops up in a cloud right over his head , saw him , and one said to the other , ' Look at the poor farmer ; I feel sorry for him . He has taken such pains with his field of corn , and now it 's all drying up . I wish I could do him some good . ' ' Yes , ' said the other ; but you are only a little raindrop ; what can you do ? ' You ca n't even wet one hillock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to be sure , I ca n't do much , but I can cheer the farmer a little , at any rate , and I 'm resolved to do my best  --  I 'll try . I 'll go down to the field to show my goodwill , if nothing more ; and so here I go . ' And down went the raindrop , and came pat on the farmer 's nose . ' Dear me ! ' said the farmer , putting his finger on his nose , ' what 's that ? A raindrop ! Where did that come from ? I do believe we shall have a shower . ' No sooner had the first one started , then the second said , ' Well , if you are going , I believe I 'll go too ; here I come . ' And down he dropped on a cornstalk . By this time , a great many raindrops had come together to hear what their companions were talking about , and when they saw them going to cheer the farmer and water the corn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good errand , I 'll go too . Look out ! Here I come ! ' ' And I ! ' said another . ' And I ! ' ' And I ! ' ' And I ! ' and so on , till a whole shower of them came and watered the corn , and it grew and ripened , and all because the first little raindrop determined to do what it could . " Now , Corporal , when you and your Company look on this banner , we hope you will keep up good heart , and never be discouraged because you ca n't do much ; for if you do what you can , angels can do no more . CORPORAL .  --  We thank you , young ladies , for this expression of your sympathies ; and , as you have requested , we will join you in singing . In strength do we come and in number appear , Surrounding our banner with joyful acclaim , Proclaiming our freedom ; no longer we fear , No slave to " I ca n't " shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we love , O triumph it must ! With the brave be our motto , " in God is our trust ; " Then long may the Try Comp'ny banner still wave , " O'er the land of the free and the home of the brave " In our own land of freedom , be it ever the same , Future ages shall read , and rejoice in the story ; Our Try Comp'ny system shall gain us a name , And religion shall wreathe our young brows with its glory . Girls retire , bearing the temperance banner . AKENSIDE.  --  Now , Corporal , Try , I feel pretty good to-day , and I guess we all do , and I propose that we boys go down to the street and procure the material to build a monument on this spot , to commemorate this grand occasion . LITTLETON.  --  I second that proposal , for I do believe that we ought to commemorate this occasion . Our fathers celebrate their great days  --  24th of May , 18th of June , and 1st of July ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Try Company  --  at least , let us raise a monument to-day . SAMUEL . ... Very well , boys ; I shall direct the Orderly to lead you , and while you are gone , I wish to persuade James to join us too . Company march off in order , under command of Hiram . Now , Jemmy , come and join our little band , and see if it wo n't be a good thing . If you only make up your mind to it , you will find work go easy enough . JAMES .  --  Well , Sam , I do n't know but I would if I had n't got such a habit of saying I ca n't , and knocking things around so . I should forget the rules a dozen times a day , and then mother would say , " There 's a pretty member of the Try Company ; " and that would make me cross , you know , and I should sulk round worse than ever . SAMUEL .  --  Oh , well , never mind . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while , you know , you 'd learn to say " Try again , " and then things would go easy enough . JAMES .  --  Well , perhaps I 'll join : but you 'll have to put me into the awkward squad , I guess , and I hope you wo n't have a very heavy fine for breaking the rules , for if you do , I shall be dead broke in a short time . SAMUEL  --  That 's right , Jemmy . Hands him a sash , and puts on his own . But here come the boys back again , and I should think they meant to have a grand monument . Enter boys as follows : 1st . Hiram as Orderly , and Champney by his side . 2nd . Four boys  --  Brown , Green , William and Akenside , bearing the base .  --  3rd , Dotheboy , with a plummet .  --  4th . Two boys , Entwistle and Filchnothing , with columns , Industry and Truth .  --  5th . Brighthopes , with banner .  --  6th . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Courtesy .  --  7th Two boys  --  Ireson and Kickman , with the entablature.  --  8th . Jenkinson , with the cap-stone.  --  9th , Littleton . The base is laid in its place , the boys with columns , set them down at a little distance from each corner ; the entablature and Cap-stone at one side . CHAMPNEY.  --  Corporal Try , we bring you the base of our monument . On its several sides it bears the mottoes , " Be Gentle , " " Be Kind , " " Be Merciful , " " Be Good . " Without the virtues here indicated , we think it impossible to establish a good name among men , and we wish this structure to remind us of all those virtues and principles which should have place in the life of a true Try Company boy . DOTHEBOY.  --  Tries the base with his plummet . I pronounce the base of the monument level and square , and securely laid . ENTWISTLE.  --  I propose to place on the north-east angle , the column of Industry , for I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as indomitable industry . The boy who always has something to do , will always do something . I know that all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy , but I would have every boy industrious at play , and when playtime is over , diligent at his work . Places his column . FILCHNOTHING.  --  I propose for the south-east angle , the column of Truth ; for without truthfulness , there can be no real prosperity in anything . The boy that tells a lie , is never to be trusted . As well may we attempt to build our mightiest structures on rotten posts and crumbling columns , as to attempt to build a good character without the support of sound practical truthfulness . Places his column . GREGORSON.  --  I propose the column of Honesty for the north-west angle , because I consider this is one of the indispensable requisites to a sound religious or secular life . There can be no piety where there is no honesty , and there can be no real success in any of the pursuits of life without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column . HARKAWAY.  --  I ask leave to place the column of Courtesy on the south-west angle , for if we are industrious , honest , and truthful , if we are not affable and courteous we shall do comparatively little to benefit others . Kindness should be an ingredient in all our actions if we would reach a high position in life . Places his column . IRESON.  --  Now that we have raised the columns , I wish , with my comrade , to place an entablature on them , bearing on its several sides the mottoes , " Love God , " " Love one another , " " Love all men , " " Love your enemies . " These are requirements which are certainly essential to a true life , and which I hope will find expression in the lives of all our comrades . The four boys who placed the columns , now place a cricket or covered box at each corner , and help put the entablature in its place . JENKINSON.  --  I have a cap-stone , on each side of which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of nothing so appropriate , for if all our efforts are not crowned with grace , they will be of little use to us or to anybody else . While he is speaking , Jemmy and Dotheboy bring in silently a pair of steps , on which Jenkinson goes up and places his cap-stone in place . KICKMAN.  --  Now , Mr. Corporal , I move we place upon the top of our beautiful monument , the banner which our sisters have so kindly presented to us . What place better than this , where its motto may ever be seen , and cheer not only our hearts , but all others who shall see it ; and possibly it may in such a position be the means of leading others to join with us , and adopt our principles . SAMUEL .  --  Let it be done . Ensign mounts the steps , and puts the banner in place . ( Enter four girls , with evergreen , and four with vases of flowers. ) 1ST GIRL .  --  Corporal Try , we come to adorn your beautiful monunent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us not only the expression of sympathy which our sisters have shown in presenting you with a banner , but we , who are younger than they , can show our interest . We wish , therefore , to wreathe this structure with evergreen , to denote that our sympathies shall ever encircle you in your efforts to do right , and to show yourselves worthy sons of our sires , who dared risk even life in the discharge of duty : Each hangs her wreaths on one side of the monument. 5TH GIRL .  --  And we wish , too , in placing these flowers on your monument , to express the desire that the virtues you emulate may ever unfold in you under genial influences from above , as these flowers unfold their beauties under gentle dews and refreshing sunshine . Each hands her vase of flowers to a boy , who places it on one corner of the monument . ( Enter a very small girl , with a bouquet of flowers . ) LITTLE GIRL .  --  Mr. Corporal I want you to accept this bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't talk much , but I have learned to say  --  ' T is a lesson you should heed , Try , try again ; If at first you do n't succeed , Try , try again ; Then your courage should appear , For if you will persevere , You will conquer , never fear , Try , try again . If you find your task is hard , Try , try again ; Time will bring you its reward , Try , try again ; All that other folks can do , Why , with patience , may not you ? Only keep this rule in view  --  Try , try again . SAMUEL .  --  We thank you , young ladies , for these expressions of interest in us ; and before you leave us , permit me to ask that you will join us in singing another song appropriate to this occasion . Little raindrops feed the rills ; Rills to meet the brooklet glide ; Brooks the broader rivers fill ; Rivers swell the ocean 's tide . Thus , the dewdrops gathered here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bounty cheer , That with greenness clothe the land . With the sea of love shall blend , Which the gospel 's grace doth pour , Till the name of Jesus sound , E'en to earth 's remotest shore . Praise to thee , O Lord , forever , Gladly now we all unite ; Praise to thee , O God ! the giver , Blessed Lord of life and light ! Girls retire . JAMES .  --  I feel a little ashamed , Corporal , that I refused to help you to do a good deed to-day , but I feel so much better now , I move we all adjourn to old Rogers , and do up his work for him without delay . SAMUEL .  --  Very well , boys ; form line . To the right face ! Quick  --  march ! All march off in order.
