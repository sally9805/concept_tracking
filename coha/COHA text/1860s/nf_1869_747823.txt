txt The " B. 0 . W. C. , " with their History , Mystery , and Wonderful Doings ; and how an aged Afri can became elevated to the Dignity of " Grand Panjandrum. ' ' fFTER the long winter session , the approach of the spring vacation had been eagerly welcomed at the Grand Pro* School . It was only a short recess , and the majority of the boys would not be able to go home ; but such as it was , its advent created the greatest delight . On a pleasant evening in May the examinations were over ; little knots of boys were gathered jubilantly in various places , bonfires were blazing , squibs fizzing , crackers snapping , and everything and everybody were as noisy and as jolly as possible . In the midst of all this , and immediately after tea , the " B. W. C. " had called a meeting in the /z/ Rawdons ' rooms . Who or what the " B. 0 . W. C. " is , or was , will be explained on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " B. 0 . W. C. " called a meeting , and the Rawdons ' rooms had the honor , of receiving that august assemblage . Not that it was very numerous . Only four or five could be counted ; but then what they lacked in number , they made up in quality and in style . The utmost had been done to bring the rooms up to the level of so great an occasion . The table had been turned upside down , and transformed into a dais ; the book-case had been covered over with the table-cloth ; the couch had been placed on one end in the corner ; and in the middle of the room was a flour barrel covered with red flannel , ( n which was placed a phrenological bust . Added to this , the room was darkened a smoky lamp shedding a feeble and fitful ray over the scene , and dimly disclosing four figures at one end . These four figures were alF dressed in white . The costume was a simple , but a highly effective one . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head and falling to the feet , with two holes for the eyes . In this attire the four figures not a little resemblance to some of those orders of monks which exist in Europe . The table , which lay on the floor , legs upward , with the addition of the ottoman , served as a dais , on which stood a figure with an immense militia captain 's swurd in his hand . On each side was also a figure /z/ holding a huge wooden battle-axe , while the fourth stood between the dais and the bust . Soon the silence was disturbed by a knock at the door communicating with the bed-room . The boy near the bust gave it three smart raps , upon which the door opened , and a figure entered clothed like the others in the room . On entering he made a low bow , and then stood erect . The four figures in the room raised their hands to their faces with a peculiar gesture . " Blood ! " said they in solemn tones . " Thunder ! " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is the Grand Panjandrum with you , Venerable " Warden ? " said the figure on the dais . " He is , Most Venerable Patriarch . " " Let him enter . " At this the Venerable Warden left the room , and in a few moments reappeared , ushering in the personage alluded to as the Grand Panjandrum . The Grand Panjandrum was an aged gentleman of color , whose wrinkled face was enlivened by an irrepressible comicality of expression , which not even the solemnity of this occasion could quell . He was arrayed in a college cap and gown , with a Master 's red hood and long bands . His face was a study . He was evidently doing his best to ex hibit the deepest solemnity of expression , but his droll , keen , twinkling eyes darted furtively about , with an intense relish of the scene before him , and /z/ his efforts at gravity were sadly disturbed by the broad grin which , 1'rom time to time , would flash out irrepressibly over the dark background of his face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with an audible chuckle , he awaited further proceedings . " Grand Panjandrum , " said the figure on the dais , in an impressive voice . " Yes , sah . " " Yes , what ? " said the other , in a tone of re buke . " Yes , sah , yes , mos ' wossifle , " he added , cor recting himself . A grin broke out over his face , which , however , was instantly checked by a demure cough . " Grand Panjandrum , you have heard our man dates . " " Mandates ? " said the other , in a puzzled tone . " Yes , orders . " " Yes , sah , mos ' wossifle . " " Have you carried out the instructions of the Venerable Brethren ? " " Yes , sah , mos ' wospeful . " " Did you get the turkeys ? " " Yes , sah . " " How many ? Six ? " " Xo , ftah . " " What ! not six ? " - Xo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ " Ten/ ' said the other , with a chuckle and a grin of triumph . " 0-h ! " said the first speaker ; while a titter ran round among the others . " H 7 m ! Very well , and what else ? " " Spring chickens . " u How many ? " " Twenty . " " Ah 1 Very well . And how ? " " Broiled , sah . " " Any tongue ? " " Yes , sah , three . " " And the ham. ? " " Yes , sah . " " Nuts ? " " Yes , sah . " " Raisins ? " " Yes , sah . " " Crackers ? Cheese ? Figs ? Cake ? " " Yes , sah , mos ' wossifle . " " And what about the drink ? Have you pre pared the lemonade ? " " No , sah . " " No ! Why not ? " " No lemons , sah . " " That 's bad . And there is no drink , then ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ginger beer . H 'm ! that will do , " said the Venerable Patriarch , solemnly . " How much have you ? " /z/ " Ten gallons , mos ' wossifle. " - What else have you ? " " Ten mince pies , twelve apple pies , a basket of tarts , a tin dipper , an iron pot , an iron spoon , " said the Grand Panjandrum , rapidly enumerating the various items . " Fact , " he continued , carried away by the ardor of the moment , " I'se got most nigh eteryting . Gracious sakes ! you 'll open your blessed eyes , mind I tell you 1 But what are you gwine to do about de bread and butter ? Tell you what , boys ! you 've clean forgot de most ' portant of all . " " Silence ! " cried the Venerable Patriarch , in an indignant voice , rapping his sword against the leg of the table . " The sakes now ! how you do go on ! " said the Grand Panjandrum , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Venerable Patriarch , in a stern voice . " Yes , sah , " said the other , assuming an expres sion of awful solemnity . " Venerable Warden ! " " Yes , Most Venerable Patriarch . " " The audience is over ! Escort the Grand Panjan.lrum to the outer world . " The Venerable Warden bowed , and led the way out , followed by his sable companion . Scarcely had the door closed behind them than the scene underwent a sudden change . With a shout , the four figures flung off their white drape- /z/ ries , and kicked them into a corner of the room . Then they drew back the curtains , replaced the table and couch , while the light that now came into the room showed the laughing faces of four boys , which had nothing in common with the sepulchral figures that had taken part in the late scene . Two of these boys were big , brawny , broadshouldered fellows , with Roman features , and dark , curling hair . They very closely resembled one another . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The elder was named Bruce , and the younger Arthur . Of the others , one was tall and slight , Tom Crawford by name ; and the other was small and slight , and was called Phil Kennedy ? " Hurrah , boys ! " said Phil . " Is n't old Solomon a perfect brick of an old darkey ? Do you fairly realize the fact that we are to have ten turkeys , ten , my boys , instead of six ? " " And the spring chickens I " said Tom Craw ford . " And the mince pies ! " said Bruce . " And the ginger beer ! " cried Arthur . " The encampment , of the l B. O. " W. C. ' is going to be a grand success , " said Bruce . " It will be memorable forever in the history of the school . " " We ought to have a grand bonfire , and burn our Latin Grammars , before starting , " said Torn Crawford. /z/ " Yes , " said Phil Kennedy , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arithmetics in the world . " " No , no , " said Arthur , f ' do n't let us have a bon fire . Let us have a burial , with a solemn pro cession , and a real burial service . " " Well , what 'll we bury ? " " The Latin Grammar . " " No , Crcsar . " " No , the Arithmetic . " " Let 's bury them all ; that is the best plan , " said Phil . " Yes , " cried all ; and a confused medley of pro posals arose , in which all were talking together . In the midst of the uproar the door opened , and the Venerable Warden made his appearance . Throwing off his white robe , he disclosed the fair , round face of a fresh , handsome boy , with merry , mischievous eyes , and curling golden hair . That busy brain of his had been prolific in all sorts of plans dear to boys , while his generous nature and frank , pleasant manner made Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Bart , " said Tom Crawford , " what about that powder ? " Hart left the room for a moment , and returned with a package under his arm . " Tin- pi.wder ? " said he . " It 's all right . I 've got it in my room . " " And the rods ? " /z/ " Yes , I 've got the rods too . " " Any matches ? " " Matches ? Of course not . " " Why , what 'll we do for lights and fires ? " " I hope you do n't mean to say that you would dream of taking matches " said Bart , in a voice of solemn rebuke . Why not ? " " Why not ? Who ever heard of matches in an Encampment of Knights ? No , boys , flint and steel is the thing for us . That 's what I 've got ; and I 've made some first-rate tinder , and a lot of sulphur lights . Besides , I 've got something to surprise you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Dresses ? " " Yes ; come to my room , and I 'll show you what I 've got . It would n't do for us to go out and be brigands in ordinary jackets and trousers , I hope . Why , " he concluded , in a tone of rebuke , " it would be infamous . " " And have you got any dresses in your room ? " said Bruce . ' " Yes ; come along and take a look at them . " Off went the five with a shout , and going up a flight of stairs , they soon entered Bart Darner 's room . Here Bart brought out a bundle from the bed-room , and opening it , he proudly displayed its contents . There were five red shirts , each of /z/ which had a huge white cross on the back ; five belts ; and five felt hats , each of which was decorated with a feather . As he displayed these articles one by one , the " boys were struck dumb with admiration , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say anything , " said he , " but try them on . " Bart ' locked the door carefully , and then they all arrayed themselves in the new costume . Soon five figures stood there with their red shirts and pluned hats , looking like so many juvenile Garitaldians . " You see , these belts will do first rate for pistols , and daggers , and that sort of thing , " said Bart . The other boys said nothing . Astonishment and delight deprived them of words ; but each stood looking , first at himself , and then at his compan ions , in mute admiration . " But how in the world did you manage it , Bart ? " Where did you get them all ? " asked Tom Crawford . " O , I found the shirts down in Brown 's , " said Bart , " and picked out the smallest ones . I had them altered , and got Maggie Lunt to sew on the crosses . I begged some old ostrich feathers from Mrs. Porter , and of course the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we can put bits of paper inside the lining , you know , and make them fit well enough . They 'll do for the woods . " /z/ " Do for the woods ! " cried Bruce Rawdon . " 1 should think they would , and for other places , too . Boys , do n't let 's hide our light under a bushel . I move that we have a gran 'd procession at once . " " Yes , yes , " cried all . " Let 's go down now . The fellows are all out on the grounds . " " How they 'll stare ! " cried Phil . " The ' B. 0 . W. C. ' will become more famous than ever , " said Tom Crawford . " Come , then , " said Arthur , " let us go down now . " " No , " said Bart . That would spoil all . " " Why , do n't you want the ' B. 0 . AV . C. ' to show themselves ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you what to do . Let 's wait till to-morrow , and then we 'll get Jiggins 's cart , and make Solomon drive , dressed as Venerable Warden , up to the woods . We 'll follow as brigands . " " Hurrah ! That 's splendid ! " said Bruce Raw don . " And I 'll show you something else , " said Bart , taking up the parcel which he had under his arm in the Rawdons ' room . " I 've got something else . " And he proceeded to open the parcel , while the others looked on with eager expectation . He opened it , and drew out a folded cloth . Unfolding this , he shook it out , and spread it on the table . It was a black flag . , Upon this was stitched some thing round , which close examination showed to be /z/ a desperate effort to represent a skull . To the ordinary observer , however , it looked exactly like an elderly gentleman 's face , quite bald , and with a benevolent grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ W. C. " At sight of this , the longrepressed feelings of the boys burst forth without restraint . AVith wild shouts they waved their hats in the air , and at last gave three cheers for Bart . It was long before their wild excitement could bo quelled . Until late that night they sat in their wonderful dresses , admiring their wonderful lla  --  , arid waiting , with eager impatience , for the next day . But who or what was the " B. O. W. C. " ? That I must now proceed to answer . The " B. 0 . W. C. " arose from the genius of Bart Darner , who , in some respects , was the most remarkable boy at Grand Pr6 School . His career there had been a highly eventful one . His father was a merchant of the town of St. John , and Bart had gathered , from the atmosphere of his native place , a passionate desire to go to sea . " With the idea of curing him of this fancy , his father had taken him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturedly , and had been formally entered as a scholar . The first acquaintances which Bart made were the Rawdon boys ; and on the very first evening after his arrival he confided to them his determination to- quit the school immediately . This determination Bart was not very long in /z/ putting into execution . Two days after his father had left , Bart was among the missing . Inquiries were made everywhere , but in vain . At length the worthy head master , Dr. Porter , conjectured that he might have gone home ; so he sent in the direction in which he supposed it most likely that the fugitive would go . The conjecture proved to be well founded . Bart was found , on the foUowing day , at an inn about forty miles away . He made no objection to returning , confessed that he was on his way home , and made light of the whole affair . Dr. Porter extorted from him a promise that he would make no further attempts to go home , and Bart began his school life . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of three weeks it was found that Bart was again missing . Dr. Porter was deeply hurt , for he feared that Bart had broken his word . Search was made everywhere , but in vain* A week passed away , but no discovery had been made . At the end of that time , Old Solomon , the cook of the boarding school , affected perhaps by Dr. Porter 's deep anxiety , came to him and disclosed the hiding-place of the fugitive . It ap peared that Bart had struck up an eternal friend ship with Solomon , and had gained his assistance in a new scheme of flight . This time he did not seek to go home , for he had promised Dr. Porter not to do so . His plan was to escape to the woods , and build a hut , while Solomon was to bring him /z/ provision and news from the outer world . The Rawdons had been taken into the secret , and Bart had been enjoying the life of a hermit , and thought lessly amusing himself with baffling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porter at once made Solomon accompany him to the hiding-place ; and finding Bart there , he sent Solomon back , and had a long conversation with the youthful hermit . What he said or did no one else knew ; but his mode of treatment was so effectual , that Bart from that time forward gave up his wandering ways . A long composition was allotted him as a punishment , and Bart bore the penalty of his misdeeds like a man . After this he diverted his active powers into a more legitimate channel , and rapidly became one of the best scholars in his class . His restlessness of temper and liveliness of disposition showed them selves in the invention of new games and sports for the amusement of his companions . He became a curious compound of intense earnestness and wild levity . In school no one was so utterly absorbed in study as he ; and outside , on the play-ground , no one abandoned himself so completely to fun and merriment . He took prizes and threw balls with equal facility . He invented new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fastening skates . He introduced new variations in the venerable game of marbles . He made beautiful little schooners . Hi ' even constructed a steamboat out of an ojd /z/ clock . He organized a military company , including all the boys in the school , with lath guns and wooden swords , and a band which played Jew'sharps and tin pails . But the greatest of all his achievements was the organization of the " B. 0 . W. C. " It arose on this wise . From the very outset he had formed a close con nection with four other boys , and the attachment to one another grew stronger among them every day . After organizing his militia company , and adding to it its famous " Tin Band , " Bart looked around him for more worlds to conquer ; in other words , for new ideas to put into practice . In a moment of inspiration he conceived the plan of a secret society , which was to include himself and his friends . No sooner was this suggested to the others , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was the first thing . At first they thought of calling it the " Pentagon . " Then they thought of the " Quintette . " Other names suggested themselves ; but finally they decided upon the " B. 0 . W. C. " The use of letters gave a charming mystery . No one but a member of the society could ever penetrate the tremendous secret . But the time has at length come for divulging it . It 1 shall be a secret no longer . Those mysterious letters , then , were intended to represent " The Brethren of the Order of the White Cross . " As to the rest , the most charming ingenuity was /z/ shown in arranging the details . The officers had names of solemn import . They were , 1 . The Most Venerable Patriarch . 2 . The Venerable Scribe . 3 . The Riyld Worshipful Commander . 4 . The Grand Scholastic . 5 . The Venerable Warden . Afterward another dignity was added . It was arranged that each office should be held only for one month . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in this way each mem ber had a chance of filling every office in due time . The initiation ceremonies were tremendous ; the only trouble about these being that they never had any persons on whom to exercise them . They remained , therefore , like so many beautiful dreams . The costumes have already been described . The most important thing among their furniture was the phrenological bust . This was the pride and delight of the " B. 0 . W. C. " It had been obtained from a young man who was studying medicine in the village , and who levied a heavy tax upon tho purses of the society for so precious an article . They had the bust , however , and did not complain . I have said that another dignity was added to the original five . This was in the person of the venerable Solomon . In consideration of - his age , his color , his occupation as cook , and his eminent previous services to all of them individually , it was unanimously resolved that he should be admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused him the terrific initiation ceremony . Per haps the idea that he might object to some of the details influenced them in this . Be this as it may , Old Solomon became a member , and a new dignity was created especially for him . In a full meeting of the society , it was unanimously voted that he be created Perpetual Grand Panjandrum. /z/ Grand Pre and Minos Basin . An astonishing Pro cession . Encampment of Brigands . Break-up of Encampment and Flight of the Inmates . Grand Prd Academy , under the presiding care of Dr. Porter , was a highly popular and very efficient boarding school . In choosing such a place for the Academy . Dr. Porter had shown that ardent love of nature which always distin guished him . It was situated in a place which yields to no other in the world for varied charms of land , sea , and sky , and which can never be forgotten after it has once been seen . Standing upon the slope of a hill , the Academy , with its broad portico and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been described in Longfellow 's ex quisite verse : " In the Acadian land , on the shores of the Basin of Minas , Distant secluded still , the little village of Grand Pre Lay in the fruitful valley . Vast meadows stretched to the eastward , Git-ing the village its name , and pasture to flocks without number . Dikes that the hands *f the farmers had reared with labor incessant , /z/ Shut out the turhulent tides ; but at stated seasons the flood gates Opened , and welcomed the sea to wander at will o'er the meadows . West and south there were fields of flax , and orchards and cornfields Spreading afar and unfenced o'er the plain ; and away to the northward Blomidon rose , and the forests old ; and aloft on the moun tains Sea-fogs pitched their tents , and mists from the mighty Atlantic Looked on the happy valley , but ' ne'er from their station de scended . " Looking from the portico of the Academy , the eye rested upon a broad expanse of dike land im mediately in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . These the old Acadian farmers had first reclaimed from the sea , and after ward their successors , had reared - new dikes and reclaimed wider districts . The broad meadows immediately in front were bounded by the Corn wall ! s River , a stream which at high tide can float the largest ship , but which at low tide is so nearly empty that but a slight rivulet runs through its channel . It runs into the Basin of Minas , where are the highest tides in the world . Here the sea carries in its salt waves up to where the dikes rise against them , and afterward retreating , they go back for miles , leaving vast tracts of mud flats exposed to the view . For many miles all around there are rivers that run into this bay , all of which /z/ are subject to the same tides , and experience the same great vicissitudes , changing twice in the twenty-four hours from shallow rivulets at the bot tom of valleys of mud , to vast rivers which flow with swift and full streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarce float a canoe , will grow to a mighty volume of water , where navies might pass . Twice each day may be seen the startling spectacle , once used as a formula for the impossible , of rivers running from the sea up their channels ; and twice on each day the scene on Minas shores changes from a wide expanse of red mud to a vast sheet of deep-blue sea . All that is wonderful and all that is sublime in nature may be found here , side by side with all that is most sweet and beautiful . Behind the hill on whose slope the school stands lies the valley of the Gaspereaux , an Eden-like retreat , shut in by high hills and watered by a winding river , se questered from the world , full of that strange charm of repose that may so seldom be met with in this busy age . Before the hill there spreads away for many a mile the broad vale of Cormvallis , through which there flow five rivers , whose waters are all chained up at their mouths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands to the farmers of the valley . Far away on the other side extends a long range of hills , which push themselves forward into Minas Basin till they end in a precipitous cliff , whose towering form is the /z/ centre of attraction for many and many a mile . This is the famous Cape Blomidon , whose position is so peculiar , and whose shape is so striking , that it forms the central object tospectators all around the shores of the bay . Here is a channel opening into the Bay of Fundy outside , and this channel is the gate-way through which the dis turbed and impetuous Avaters of the two seas for ever rush backward and forward . In that outer bay there are fierce tides , and swift currents , and iron-bound shores , and lonely rocky isles ; there are dense fogs , sharp squalls , and sud den storms . The mists that prevail there are kept away by that lofty wall which terminates in Blomi don , and can not penetrate into the well-protected country within . The mists and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never vic torious . From the sunny plains of Cormvallis and Grand Pre* they may be seen crowded and'piled up on the top of Blomidon , frowning darkly and menacingly upon the scene beneath , as though eager to descend . But Old Blomidon guards well the land which he protects , and the mist and the fog " that cross his crest are broken and dissipated into thin air . From all this there arise wondrous atmospheric effects . Here , when the fog is piled up in gloomy masses over Blomidon , and the sun is setting be hind them , may be seen a spectacle so gorgeous that , if it could be portrayed t on canvas , few would /z/ believe it to be a copy of nature . It would be deemed the fantastic vision of some artist mad from love of deep gloom and vivid color ; for the colors here at sunset are sometimes as numerous , as varied , and as vivid as those of a rainbow . The whole west glows with indescribable glory , when out of black clouds and voluminous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth from which shoot up innumerable rays iiir into - the zenitlr , formed of every hue and shade , which shift and change like the rays of the Aurora Borealis , and cast upon all the sky and upon all the earth something of their own splendid radiance . Early on the morning which followed the meet ing of the " B. 0 . W. C. , " a singular scene was pre sented in front of the Academy . A crowd had gathered there surrounding a very remarkable group . There was a cart containing a number of baskets and some pots , in which was harnesses I a quadruped which charity might consent to name a horse , but which looked more like a skeleton of one of the extinct species . Seated high and dry in an old arm-chair was the venerable figure of Solomon in his robes of office , that is to say , " his office of Perpetual Grand Panjandrum . He had an old college cap and gown , and a master 's hood , while the spectacles that Uestrided his nose , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to strike aw r e into the beholder . Behind the cart were the " B. 0 . W. C. , " robed in the red /z/ shirts and plumed hats which Bart had found for thorn . Bart had a pistol in his belt . Each one had something , if it were nothing better than a caseknife . But the centre of all eyes was the flag . This Bart had generously handed over to Bruce Rawdon , who was the Most Venerable Patriarch for the month of May . As the wind caught it and unfolded it before the astonished eyes of the other boys , the skeleton head grinned benignantly at them from his airy home , and a loud shout of ad miration burst forth from all . Solomon cracked his whip . The procession started . The noise , the laughter , and the joking were wonderful . Heads appeared at all the win dows of the house where the teachers lived . There were the laughing faces of Dr. Porter and his family ; there was the wondering gaze of Mr. Simmons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the long , solemn physiognomy of Mr. Long , of the English department . Thus the procession went on , followed by all the boys , and the centre of admir.ing interest . It was a proud moment for the " B. 0 . W. C. " In this fashion they went up the hill behind the Academy , and at length reached the woods . They passed several cavities in the ground which had once been cellars of the old Acadian houses . They ed through an orchard where the old , neglected apple trees still spoke of the Acadian farmer who had planted them and cleared the forest around . /z/ The road entered the woods , and they went along for some distance . At last , in the midst of tho woods they turned aside to the left , and after a hundred yards or so they stopped , and the cart was unloaded . At this place there was a steep descent on the right through the thick woods . Down this the " B. 0 . W. C. " carried the articles which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a space clear of trees , where a brook ran bab bling on . About twenty yards up , a dam had been built , and a pond of water formed , at one end of which was a large camp made of spruce and fir . Shut in among the woods , with the little pond in front of it , and the brook babbling behind it , it formed as secluded a place as could be desired . This spot was once the hiding-place of Bart during his second flight , and had ever since been a favorite resort of his . There were many camps and pleas ant arbors through the woods , but the newly-made pond had given to this place the undoubted pre eminence . It had all been done very secretly within a week , and all the other boys now saw it for the first time , and gave utterance to their feel ings in low murmurs of surprise and admiration . But the " B. 0 . W. C. " had much to attend to . First of all , they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to arrange them , and finally they had the most important duty of all to attend to , which was no less momentous a thing than /z/ hoisting their flag . Soon the moment came . A pole had been already prepared . The ropes were attached , the pole was nailed to a corner post of the camp , and the flag was hauled up to its place with loud cheers , in which all the other boys joined with the greatest vigor . After this the " B. 0 . W. C. " flung themselves down and rested for a time . The other boys inspected the place closely , and questioned the owners of the camp as to their intention . " Are you going to sleep here ? " " 0 , yes . " " What'llyou sleep on ? " " Brush , of course . " " And will you cook ? " " 0 , yes . " " Have you a fireplace ? " " No , but we 're going to make one to-day . " " What 'll you do if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Pooh ! You do n't mean to say that you 'd stay here if you got wet through . " " Would n't we , though ? You see . " " Dr. Porter would n't let you . " " 0 , yes , he would . He always says it do n't hurt boys to get wet . " " 0 , he means by day . He would n't let you sleep here in a storm . " " Why not ? The camp is good enough . " " Good enough ? It ca n't keep the rain off . " /z/ " 0 , yes , it can . " " You have n't enough to eat here have you ? " asked others . " Plenty . " " Nonsense ! It will all be gone before two days . " " Well , ca n't we easily get things ? I 've got a pistol , and mean to shoot hares and things . " Bart proudly displayed his pistol , and the sight of this formidable arm silenced all controversy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've got a gun . " " A gun ! " repeated the others , in low tones . " Yes ; we expect to be attacked . " " Attacked ? Who 'd attack you ? " " 0 , the Gaspereaugians . " ( " The Gaspereaugians " was a name given by the boys to the inhabitants of Gaspereaux . ) " Do you think they will ? " " Of course ; but if they try it , they 'll find us ready for them , " said Bart , fiercely . " We 've hoisted our flag , and I 'd like to see the Gaspereaugian that would dare to pull it down . " " Well , if it comes to that , you 've got us , you know . We 'll be on hand . " " Of course , " said Bart , gravely . " I 'll tell you what we 're going to do : we 'll send out scouts , and if we see any signs of an attack , we 'll let you know . IVe got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you 'll be along to help . See . " And Bart stepped back to a bundle , out of which /z/ he pulled a long tin horn , of the kind known among ' longshoremen as " fog-horns . " " But we wo n't blow it till we 're hard up , you know , " he continued . " We 'll only blow it if they come in a great crowd , you know . " " 0 , yes ; of course . " The boys now broke up into little knots , and proposed all sorts of plans . A mania for camping out set in strong among them all . The example of the " B. 0 . W. C. " in damming the stream was to be imitated at once . Each little knot of boys had places peculiar to themselves along the same stream , some of which were the work of predecessors , and had something like a history . After a time most of the boys went back for spades , pickaxes , shov els , axes , and whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The " B. 0 . W. C. " then turned their attention toward the comple tion , of their own camp . A fireplace had still to be built , and brush cut for beds . To this they de voted themselves very vigorously , and worked till about ten o'clock , when their labors were suddenly interrupted by the appearance of Dr. Porter and Mr. Simmons . They stood for some time looking with a smile at the busy scene , before they were noticed . As soon as the boys recognized their visitors , they came up laughing , eager to describe the beauties of their camp . Dr. Porter was much amused , particularly with the flag , which floated from the mast . /z/ " Boys , " said he at length , after he had asked about everything , " I have come up to make you an offer . " " An offer ? What is it , sir ? " cried they all . " How would you like to give up , for the present , your bandit camp , take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away ? " " What , sir ! " cried the boys in consternation , and a cloud of gloom passed over their faces . " How would you like me to charter a little schooner , fill it with provisions , turn the hold into a sleeping-place , and start off for a week 's cruise around the Basin of Minas , going ashore at the Five Islands , at Parrsboro ' , at Blomidon , and at any other place where we might wish ? What do you say to that ? Ah , ha ! " cried the doctor , as he watched the changing faces of the boys , where the gloom had vanished instantly , and given place to the wildest delight . " Ah , ha ! that suits you does it ! Well , that 's what I 've come to propose . " " 0 , Dr. Porter ! Are you really in earnest ? Do you mean it ? a schooner a schooner ? a cruise round Minas Basin ? O , good ! good ! good ! Hurrah ! Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these burst from the boys as they dashed about in wild and frantic delight , overwhelmed with joy at this proposal to all of them . It seemed a thing so glorious that nothing of which the mind could /z/ conceive was to be compared with it . A cruise round Minas Basin ! What did not that involve ? Adventures of a hundred kinds ; drifting about in wild tides ; getting lost in dense fogs ; running ashore on wide mud flats , or on precipitous cliffs , or on the edge of perilous breakers ; landing on lonely headlands , or on solitary islands ; penetrating far forests ; camping out in wildernesses ; living pirate fashion in their own schooner , where all would be given up to them ; shooting , fishing ; hunting for gulls ' nests ; it meant not sham ad ventures , but real ones with real dangers envi roning them instead of fancied ones . They could cease playing at Robbers , and play what to them seemed the nobler part of Pirates ; the skulland-cross-bones flag could adorn the schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing cliffs of Blomidon . It meant anything and everything , and far more than even their vivid fancies could very well portray . To most boys the sea always promises more adventure than the land ; there is always something of the joy of discovery in every new voyage , and so all these boys felt " now ; but to Bart , most of all , was the prospect most delightful ; for he had already known to the full that longing for the sea which many boys have , and that which his father had prevented him from realizing , now seemed to come to him . In some re spects this seemed to be better than the voyage which he had formerly dreamed of ; for though it /z/ would not be long , yet it would be varied and eventful , and not free from danger . Best of all , it would be made in company with the other boys . It was some time before the boys were able , in their excitement , to get any clear idea of what Dr. Porter was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Long wished to visit Blomidon and the Five Islands in search after min erals , wit &; which the cliffs are filled . They had concluded to get a schooner , and take the larger boys with them . They expected to spend about a week , and take provisions sufficient for that time . Dr. Porter would not be able to go himself , but would intrust the boys to the care and the juris diction of Messrs . Simmons and Long . Such was the plan . Moreover , the schooner was already engaged . It was the Antelope , Captain ' Corbet ; and it was proposed to leave , if possible , that very afternoon , so as to be on the other side of the bay , or at least near Blomidon , by sundown . As it was then ten o'clock , there was no time to lose , but everything should be prepared at once , and taken on board the schooner . One thing only was insisted on by Dr.* Porter ; and that was , that they should take no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol , however , that the doctor let him keep it , and satisfied himself by making them leave the gun behind . /z/ Another extraordinary Procession . An eccentric Crew . A flighty Skipper . Wonderful Attach ment of Captain Corbet to his Offspring . Steal ing a Stone Fence , and raising the Mack Flag . , the woods were deserted . Twelve or fifteen boys were selected as worthy of the f** ' adventurous voyage , and these all made their preparations , while the smaller boys looked on with longing eyes . As for the " B. 0 . W. C. , " they had no preparations to make . They needed only to transfer their provisions and other things from the camp to the schooner . The teachers were to see about the bedding , fec . These boys therefore enlisted Old Solomon in their service , and packed their things once more in the same cart which had taken them to the camp ; after which they waited to accompany the others to the schooner . All possible haste was made ; and soon there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the one which had gone into the woods . First of all went a huge hay-cart crammed with /z/ bedding ; then followed a wagon filled with pro visions ; and after this the cart of the " B. 0 . W. C. , " driven by Solomon . Then followed the voyageurs in procession ; and after these came the small boys , green with envy . Messrs . Simmons and Long walked modestly on the sidewalk , not caring to identify themselves with so odd a crowd . In fact it was an odd crowd . First there was Solomon in full canonicals , then the " B. 0 . W. C. " in their red shirts and plumed caps , with axes and knives in their belts ; and then followed their companions in the voyage , dressed more grotesquely still . All the old clothes that could be found were pressed into service for this occasion . Old peajackets , old " sou ' - wester " hats , old coats denuded of skirts , jackets in a state of dilapidation , battered caps , shocking bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever so long , all were now brought into requisition , and formed an assemblage which was sufficient to drive an " Old Clo ' " man wild with covetousness . Now , as Homer , at the outset of his poem , enu merates the ships and chieftains , so will I complete the enumeration of the voyageurs in this adventur ous expedition . First , then , there came a little Irishman , who had accidentally dropped into the Academy , and had remained . His name was Michael Murphy , and consequently he was always called Pat , except when the boys called him Patsie , for short , as /z/ they said . He wore an old sky-blue dress-coat , with three brass buttons still remaining , fastened around the waist with a red woollen comforter . A battered silk hat , with the top of the crown off , completed his costume . " With him came Peter Fraser , commonly known as Johnnie Blue , a thick-set , bullet-headed boy , full of obstinate , persevering courage , and dressed in a sailor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cutting off the sleeves . He wore a sou ' wester , and carried a sailor 's knife . In fact , his get-up was very remarkably nautical . Then came David Digg , a tall , solemn , pale boy , very studious , with a taste for geology . He wore an old overcoat minus the tails , and a knitted yarn night-cap . David Digg was always called Bogud by the boys , from the fact that in one of the rules of the Latin Grammar they had learned that " David and Bogud are common . " Then came George McLeod , whose name was facetiously contracted into Muckle . By some ex traordinary means he had obtained possession of a soldier 's red coat , and produced an immense sen sation . Then came Jacob Wiggins , whose name was easily contracted into Jiggins , by which name alone he was known . He wore a red bandana handkerchief around his head , and was arrayed in a big gray homespun coat , which he had borrowed from a friendly farmer . /z/ After these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tail coat , long top boots , and a felt hat . And last , there was George Henderson , who had gained the singular name of Sammy Bam Bam , which occurs in one of Dr. Bird 's novels , from some amusing incident in his school life . A very old jacket , a very ragged pair of trousers , and a hat on the extreme verge of decrepitude , formed his attire . The chief harbor of Grand Prd now goes by the name of Mud Creek , and is one of the many ex amples which go to prove that the Anglo-Saxon , though superior to the Frenchman in colonizing a new country , is very far his inferior in giving names to the places which he may have colonized . At this place the party soon arrived , and looked for the vessel . To their surprise , they found her quite deserted , lying aground at a wharf . On going aboard , they found that no preparations whatever had been made . " This is too bad ! " cried Mr. Long , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here early , and have everything ready . I wonder what can have become of him . " Saying this , he started off to try and find Captain Corbet . After about half an hour he returned . " I 'll tell you what it is , " he said ; " we ca n't afford to wait . We , must begin right away and make our arrangements . " . ... /z/ " There 's no ballast on board/ ' said Mr. Simmons , who had been carefully inspecting the vessel , " and no floor in the hold . " " What ! " cried Mr. Long ; and hurrying on board , he soon saw that such was indeed the case . He then stood for a time vexed and perplexed . " Well , boys , " said he at length , " we must all get to work , so that we may be ready when Corbet does come . There 's a pile of stones over there which will do very well for ballast ; " and he pointed to a stone wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now come , boys , " he continued , " form a line from the stones to the schooner , and pass them all along from hand to hand . " " But it 's Mr ' . Brown 's fence , " objected Mr. Sim mons , who did not relish this infringement on the rights of another . " 0 , Mr. Brown wo n't mind ! " was the reply . ' He knows me . Come , boys ; " and Mr. Long , who ras always rapid and energetic , soon formed the boys in line , and the stones were speedily trans ferred from hand to hand . " Mr. Simmons , " said Mr. Long , after a time , " I think I 'll go and get some boards . " And saying this , he hurried away , leaving the others hard at work , and expecting the absent Corbet . The boys worked with a will ; and even the smaller ones , who were to have no part in the voyage , formed another line , and passed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel was considered by /z/ Mr. Simmons to have sufficient ballast , the garden wall had vanished , and the boys stood waiting , with blistered hands , for Captain Corbet . While they were waiting , Mr. Long once more appeared . " What ! has n't Corbet come yet ? " he cried . " No . " Mr. Long looked around in despair . " I 've had to go three miles for the boards , " said he . " They 'll be here in a few minutes . Every thing is against us to-day . We 've got to work hard yet , or we wo n't get off . Mr. Simmons , would you be kind enough to go and see if you can find Corbet in the village ? and I 'll go down into the hold to lay the flooring . " Off went Mr. Simmons , and down went Mr. Long into the hold . The wagon soon arrived with the boards , which were passed down to him , and speedi ly laid over the ballast . Thanks to his skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys set to work throwing down the bedding , and ar ranging the trunks and baskets . There was not much time , however , for any arrangements . The things lay in a confused heap , with a busy crowd laboring to reduce them to order . At the end of about half an hour Mr. Simmons returned , shaking his head . He had not found Captain Corbet . Things began to look desperate . It was now high tide , and high time for leaving . Time and tide , which wait for no man , were not going to wait for Captain Corbet. /z/ There was the Antelope all ready . She was not much of a vessel , it is true . She resembled a ash-tub in many important points . She looked leaky . She smelled strong of potatoes ; and rightly so , for that important vegetable formed her in- riable cargo . The name Antelope was a delight ful jest . Her chains were deeply eaten with rust ; her cordage and rigging had a time-worn appear ance . A venerable air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of all , there she was , and a dozen eager young hearts were burning to embark in her , and be away before the tide should fall . At last Mr. Long started off , in company with r . Simmons , to hunt up Captain Corbet , or some other man who might go in his place . The boys stood about the wharf waiting impatiently for their return . Mr. Long and his companion hurried to the village inn , and found out that Captain Corbet lived three miles away . So they borrowed a horse and wagon , and drove off as fast as possible to the house . Arriving there , they entered , and beheld a scene which so overpowered Mr. Long that for a time he could not speak . . For there in his kitchen , in a high-backed chair , in front of his own hearth-stone , there sat the identical Captain Corbet for whom so many had been waiting so long . He held an infant in his manly arms , he was gently tilting his chair to and fro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoon . So intent was he upon his tender task , that he did not hear the entrance of his ex cited pursuers . " Captain Corbet ! " The tone in which Mr. Long spoke can not pos sibly be represented in print ; or at any rate to do so would require more notes of admiration than are usually found in any common printing office . The tone will have to be imagined . Suffice it to say , that Captain Corbet dropped the spoon , almost dropped the baby also , and started to his feet as though he had been stirred up by a galvanic shock administered full on the ganglionic centres . " Captain Corbet 1 " cried Mr. Long , furiously . " Did n't you say you 'd be on the wharf in good time , and that the Antelope would leave at this tide ? " " Why ! it 's Mr. - Long ! " said Captain Corbet , " Why , Mr. Long ! Glad to see you . Sit down . Why , you railly frightened me . Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railly . " " What do you mean , " cried Mr. Iong , in a great passion , " by this mockery ? Here have we been waiting for you ever since morning , and we 've had to put the ballast on board with our own hands ; and I come here and find you quite indifferent . What do you mean , sir ? Are you going , or not ? " " Good gracious ! " said Captain Corbet . " The ballast ! Why , railly now ! Did you go and put it on board ? Why , I do declare 1 " /z/ Mr. Long gave a dark frown , and with a violent effort smothered his indignation . " Are you coming , or not ? " said he , sternly . " Coming ? Why not jest now . You see . ere 's the babby . " And he put his brown finger under the chin of his offspring , and actually forgot himself so far as to whistle to it ; after which he cast a furtive ; lance at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would admire the child . " Where 's Mrs. Corbet ? It 's her place to mind e child your place is on board the vessel . " " Why , I ca n't put the babby on the floor , as I iee ; nor I ca n't take him on board . " " Where 's Mrs. Corbet ? " " Why , you see , she started off airly to hunt up some parygolic . The babby 's troubled with wind , and " " When will she be back ? " interrupted Mr. Long . Captain Corbet shook his head solemnly . " It would take a man with a head as long as a horse to tell that , " said he , sententiously. 11 Where is She then ? I 'll drive off and get her . " " She ! law bless you , I do n't know no more'n a onhatched chick . " " Do n't know ! You surely know which way she went . " " Wai , she kind o ' tho't she 'd go to the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her married /z/ sister that lives on Billy Jackson 's farm . They 're down with the measles , and " Bother the measles ! Do you mean to say that you let her go off , and quietly sat down here to nurse your baby , when you ought to have been at work ? " " I did n't let her go . She walked off herself . ' Benjamin , ' says she , ' take care of the babby . ' He 's dreadful fond of me . Wo n't be fed by nobody else . I ginrally feed him at nights when he wakes . An ' a dreadful high-sperited creetur is that child 's mother . An ' they sha n't abuse him . No-o-o-o , " he added , abruptly , turning his conversation toward the " babby " himself , who began to make faces and utter sounds premonitory of a howl . Mr. Long turned abruptly away . " The man 's an idiot ! " said he to Mr. Simmons . " We 'll have to get sx ) me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said he , turning to Captain Corbet , who was stirring up some pap to feed his a babby ; " " I 've engaged your schooner , and I mean to start in her . All our things are on board , and we ca n't lose a whole day . You 've broken your engage ment ; so I 'll go without you . I 'll find somebody that can sail her . I 'll go to Captain Pearson , or old McNeil , or somebody . " " There ai n't a skipper in the place . You wo n't find anybody . I 'm the on'y schooner here . Every body is got off to Bosting with taters . I 'd been off , too , on'y for the babby. " /z/ " Well , when can you go ? " Captain Corbet shook his head . " O , it 'll be all right . I 'll be along some time . I dare say Mrs. Corbet ' 11 be home soon . Do n't be alarmed about me . I 'll put you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll go off now and find somebody to take me . You 've deceived me , and disappointed me . " Saying this , Mr. Long strode out of the house , followed by his companion , and drove away rapidly n search of some one to navigate the schooner . All his efforts were vain . It was as Captain Corbet said . There was n't any one in the place . Svery seafaring man had gone off in some kind of Dotato craft to Boston , allured by the high prices f potatoes . Fortunes were being made , and nothng but the desperate imbecility of Corbet pre vented him from having his share in the golden harvest . Time passed . The tide fell rapidly , and the vessel was again left aground by the retreating waters . It would be necessary to postpone their departure until the following day , for they did not care about starting in the night . There was no help for it . They would have to wait . Mr. Long went up again to see Captain Corbet , and extorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following morning . Before he left he had the satisfaction of seeing Mrs. Corbet arrive home , and got her to promise that her husband should go . As this was the only thing /z/ that could be done , he went back to make known the state of the case to the boys . As to the boys , though disappointed , they were not at all cast down . They had possession of the vessel , with beds and provisions , and on the vessel they were bound to remain . Mr. Long found that they had eaten an excellent dinner , and were pre paring their evening repast in the schooner 's hold , which they now considered their home . They did not want to go to the Academy to eat or to sleep . They were navigators , and their life was on the ocean wave , their home on the rolling deep . So they passed the night on board , and found the first experience of wild life very pleasant . Songs and laughter arose until late , and it was midnight before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Early the next morning Mr. Long was down , and found that the boys had already finished breakfast , and were eagerly awaiting the next turn in the proceedings of the day . He communicated to them his anxieties about Corbet , and gave them to understand that they might not get oft ' at all , unless they could secure the dawdling skipper . He urged them all to accompany him to Corbet 's house , so as to bring a moral power to bear which he would not be able to withstand . This proposal the boys received with three stun ning cheers . Off , then , started all the boys , headed by Mr. /z/ Long , who , in his excitement , no longer cared about the ragged regiment at his heels . For three good miles they footed it bravely , and at length stood in front of Captain Corbet 's door . Mr. Long entered , and found the navigator seated in his kitchen by the fireplace , dandling the babby . The wife of his . bosom was setting the breakfast table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why , it 's Mr. Long ! Railly now , " said Cap tain Corbet . " An ' it shall see Mr. Long , too , so it shall , " he continued , holding up the babby , who fastened its large blue eyes upon the visitor . Mr. Long turned away , and spoke aside with Mrs. Corbet . Rightly considering that she was the true head of the house , he begged her not to let them be disappointed again . He was success ful . Mrs. Corbet assured him that the moment breakfast was over she would send him off . " And we will wait , " said Mr. Long . So they waited patiently ; and at last Captain Corbet tore himself away from his house , his wife , and his babby , and went to the schooner , accom panied by the ragged regiment of boys . It was about ten o'clock , and the schooner was afloat . All tumbled onboard . The hawsers were unloosed . Captain Corbet had to go ashore to get a man whom he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with him but little time was lost . At last the sails were hoisted . The wind filled them , and the Antelope moved slowly from the /z/ vharf . A loud , ringing cheer arose as tfoe schooner started . Before the last notes died away , however ? a man was seen running down toward the wharf . He was short and fat , and panted heavily . Reach ing the wharf , he cast one look of consternation at the place where the garden wall had been , and another at the schooner . " They 've done it , by jingo ! " he exclaimed . " Hallo there ! " he screamed . " Did you go and take my fence for ballast , Corbet ? " " No , I did n't ! " yelled Corbet . " You did , you scoundrel ! Harris saw those young reprobates passing the stones on board . Bring them back at once , every one of them , or I 'll make you sup sorrow ! " Here Mr. Long stepped forward . " It 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter " " What ! " cried the owner of " the fence . " I say it is not all right ; and it is matter . Bring me back my fence ! " " I 'll bring it back . " " I 'll have the law of you ! " " All right . We 'll replace it . " " Bring it back ! " " All right . " " Bring back my fence ! " Further and further away the schooner moved , and fainter and fainter grew the voice that called after them , till at last but a low and scarcely audi ble tone could be heard . /z/ As the vessel moved away , Bart stood at flip mainmast . He had worked hard the day before , running some lanyards through the truck , and now the moment had come for his reward . Bruco Rawdon fired his pistol , and as the report died away , up to the mast head went the black flag of the " B. 0 " . W. C. " And all the boys greeted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fogs . Songs and Sea sickness . The five Islands , and a Race up a Precipice. " iNDIXGr on through the tortuous channel of the creek , they reached its mouth with out accident , and passed out into the bay . The morning was bright and beautiful , the wind blew fair , and all gave themselves up to the joy of the occasion . The Antelope , it is true , was of ancient build and model ; she was short , and broad , and round , but the wind was of such a kind as to bring out whatever capacity for sailing she might have . The sun shone brightly , and all around them sparkled the blue waves of the bay . Behind them was the long level of Grand Pro* , beyond which the hills arose , whose slopes were dotted with white houses . Before them was the wide bay bounded by the Parrsboro ' shore , while conspicu ous , as usual , arose the grand form of Blomidon . " Is Blomidon a French name ? " asked Bart of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corruption of the words /z/ Blow me doum , and it is spelled that way on old maps . A good many old coasting skippers pro nounce it in that way . The winds that prevail out there off the cape are a sufficient cause for such a name . " " Are there more winds off Blomidon than in other parts of the bay ? " " 0 , yes . It is seldom calm there . It seems as if all the winds of the Bay of Fundy and of the Basin of Minas struggled together there . It is a sort of funnel through which they all pour back ward or forward . Then the sea out there is often quite heavy . The meeting of different currents and different winds causes this . Seldom will you find a place where such fierce currents rush to and fro . " " Shall we land at Blomidon first ? " " I do not think we can with this wind . It will be better , I think , to wait till we come back . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where are the highest tides of this Basin ? " " Do you see away there , " said Mr. Simmons , pointing far away toward the right , " where the land seems to sink down ? " " Yes . " " Well , there the water runs up till it ends in the Shubenacadie River . It is there that the tide runs highest , and I suppose there is no part of the vorld where the rise is so great . " " Do you believe it rises ninety feet ? " /z/ " I have heard so , at spring tides , but I rather think it is an exaggeration . It is difficult to get a fair and accurate measurement . I do not think that it rises much over seventy feet . " " That is high enough to surpass all other tides , I should think . But see hallo ! what 's that ? " " And Bart darted to the side of the vessel , at tracted by a shout . A large schooner was approach ing , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Antelope . " Is that Captain Kidd 's craft ? " shouted one of the sailors . " Yes/ ' screamed Bart . " " We 're going to dig up a little buried treasure . " A yell of derision and laughter was the answer , to which the boys of the Antelope responded by wild , unearthly shouts ; and so the vessels passed each other . In commemoration of this little incident , one of the boys commenced to sing a doleful ditty , known in literature as " The Dying Confession of Captain Kidd , " of which the following lines will give a good idea : " O , my name is Captain Kidd , As I sailed , as I sailed ; O , my name is Captain Kidd , As I sailed . O , my name is Captain Kidd , And much wickedness I did , And a heap of gold I hid , As I sailed . " /z/ One song started another , and one by one their favorite school songs came out . One of these was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) " Three blue-bottles , Three blue-bottles , Three blue-bottles sat On a milestone. " /z/ " One flew away . " 2o VERSE . ( Slow . ) " Two blue-bottles , Two blue-bottles , Two blue-bottles sat On a milestone. " /z/ " Another flew away . " ST VERSE . ( Slower . ) " One blue-bottle , One blue-bottle , One blue-bottle sat On a milestone. " /z/ * ' That one flew away . " ( Very slow , very sad , and very solemn . ) " No blue-bottles , No blue-bottles , No blue-bottles sat On a milestone. " /z/ " One came back . " /z/ BTH VERSE . ( Less sad . ) " One blue-bottle , One blue-bottle , One blue-bottle sat On a milestone . " Gradually the blue-bottles of the song come back , till finally , on the return of the three , the song comes to a triumphant conclusion . Standing at the helm , Captain Corbet gave direc tions from time to time to the " mate " about sail ing the vessel , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile . He had already shown himself so accessible , that all the boys had chatted with him ; and at last they insisted that he should sing . Captain Corbet did not need very much solicitation . Standing at the helm with his eyes half closed , he began in a thin , shrill , piping , nasal voice , full of queer tremolos and grace notes , to drone out several melodies of a varied character . The first one was an ancient ballad , called " The Farmier 's Boy , " which began as follows : " O , the sky was black , the day was cold , And the winds did loud-ly roar , When cold and sad there corned a lad Into a farmier 's door . " ' Can you tell me , ' says he , ' if any there be Who want to give emplo-o-o-o-o-o-y For to plough and to sow , and to reap and to mow , And to be a farmier 's bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-y To be a farmier 's bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-y ? ' " /z/ Another song referred to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fell , satirical purpose against Messrs . Simmons and Long , who were both hardened bachelors , and who , in Captain Corbet 's estimation , had shown a degree of callous ness and indifference to the sweet attractions of domestic happiness which could not be too strongly rebuked . Meantime the Antelope was draAving nearer to Blomidon , and while listening to Captain Corbet 's dulcet strains , they were gazing with admiration at the dark promontory . None noticed that they were approaching a place where the water , agitated by the wind , and driven by conflicting currents , was tossing itself up into foaming waves ; but all stood carelessly about , and the song and the laugh went on . Suddenly the vessel seemed to give a jump , and then a plunge downward . At that in stant a wave came dashing over the boAvs , saturat ing to the skin a little crowd that had gathered there . Then , with a rush , and a crack , and a wild singing among the rigging , a squall struck the vessel . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her gunwale . In an instant all was confusion . Every boy grasped some rope , and held on for his life . The boys who had been drenched at the bows looked forlornly at their companions . Then poof ! came another blast , and away , away went five dark objects careering through the air to leeward . A cry from the " B. 0 . /z/ W. C. " followed this last mishap . They had lost their hats , their beautiful plumed felt hats , their pride , their joy lost them ingloriously and be yond all hope of recovery . With doleful faces they looked at one another , wondering what they could do . There were no more hats on board . They thought of handkerchiefs , and so one after another bound his handkerchief around his head . But now there was not much chance for lamentation over wet jackets or lost hats . A more dismal fate was lowering over them . Each one knew it , saw it , felt it in his inmost soul . For the sea was rough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rolling , and leaping , and jumping , more than flesh and blood could bear . At any rate , their flesh and blood could not bear it . A feeling of wretched ness came to every heart ; every face grew pale , and assumed an expression of woe . Suddenly Messrs . Long - and Simmons disappeared into the cabin . This was the signal for others . Many fol lowed . A few , however , preferred the deck , with its fresh air , to the close air and the sickening smell of bilge- water and potatoes , that predominated below . But the scene had changed for them as for all , and the grandeur of Blomidon , and the mag nificence of an iron-bound coast , were forgotten . Hushed was the merry laugh , silent the melodi ous song . Gone were the joyous young faces that but a short time before had looked out from the vessel upon the sea and sky . Faded were the /z/ bright eyes , scattered the bright visions of enjoy ment . Alas , how changed ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind grew fresher , and the waves grew rougher , and the little schooner danced about like a mad thing ; and the booms creaked against the masts , and the sails flapped furiously , and the blast went singing through the rigging . The wretched voyageurs paid no attention to it . Their thoughts were all turned inward . Little did they think now of that which they had recently been celebrating so joy ously : " A life on the ocean wave , A home on the rolling deep , " Where the scattered waters rare , And the winds and the wi-i-i-i-inds and the w-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-nds their re-e-e-e-e-vels keep ! " Time passed , and still the Antelope went tossing , and rolling , and pitching onward . How long a time no one knew . Not one of the voyageurs kept any account of that . Whether minutes or hours , they could not tell . It seemed to them all one long duration , involving days or months . But at last the motion of the vessel ceased , and she went on more smoothly . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to think of going on deck once more . Soon the joyous voice of Bart Darner summoned them up . " Come along , boys . We 're going to anchor . We 're at Five Islands . Hurrah ! " /z/ " Hurrah ! Hurrah ! " A loud cry arose . Up went the boys scrambling to the deck , and there the scene before them was sufficient to drive away all suffering . The water was smooth , the wind was quieter . Before them lay the outlines of Five Islands , rising beautifully out of the water between them and the main land , the nearest one being not more than a mile away . These islands were of different and peculiar shapes . The two more distant were rounded and well wooded ; the third , which was midway among the group , had lofty , precipitous sides , and the summit was dome-shaped ; the fourth was like a table , rising , with perpendicular sides , to the height of two hundred feet , with a flat , level surface above , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and nearest of the group , was by far the most singular . It was a bare rock , which rose irregu larly from the sea , terminating at one end in a peak , which rose about two hundred feet into the air . As they approached it , this rock had a very peculiar appearance . It resembled , more than anything else , a vast cathedral rising out of the sea , the chief mass of the rock corresponding with the main part of the cathedral , while the tower and spire were there in all their majesty . For this cause the rock has received the name of Pinnacle Island . This lonely and desolate rock , that thus rose out before them , grew more distinctly revealed as they drew nearer . At the base they saw the white /z/ foam of breaking surf ; while far on high , around its lofty , tempest-beaten summit , they saw myriads of sea-gulls . Gathering in great white clouds about this place , they sported and chased one another ; they screamed and uttered their shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearer they came , till at last they reached a smooth place on the lee of the second island . This one was so close by Pinnacle Island , that it seemed as though they might be joined at low water . Before them , within a moderate dis tance , lay a gravelled beach , which extended as far as they could see at the verge of the island , above which the dark cliifs towered precipitously . " There ! " said Mr. Simmons , pointing , with sparkling eyes , to the dark and sombre rocks , " there , boys , is the place for minerals ! I have found on those rocks the most beautiful specimens , that have ever been seen , of crystals , of jasper , and of chalcedony . I have found onyx , spar , and hundreds of other stones ; all kinds of agates , frag ments of copper ore , barytes , beautiful petrifactions , and footprints of birds among masses of sandstone . From those cliffs came the famous amethyst that was once among the crown jewels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; use your eyes , and you will find something worth remembering . David Digg , do n't forget your hammers . " His enthusiastic speech was interrupted by a shout from Captain Corbet. /z/ " Let go ! " he cried . Down came the sails ; and shortly after , rattle rattle rattle rattle , and with a plunge and a splash , the anchor rushed to the sea bottom . " And now for the boats , " said Mr. Long . The boat was brought up alongside . It was short , wide , and round , and appeared to have been constructed after the identical tub which had evi dently served as a model for the Antelope . There was but one oar , which was used to propel the boat by sculling . Not more than five or six could get into her with safety . " We ca n't all go ashore in that , " said Mr. Sim mons . " Why not ? " asked Captain Corbet . " Why , she wo n't hold us . " " Yes , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , sir , " persisted Captain Corbet . " Of course you do n't all mean to go at once . " " 0 , I see , " said Mr. Simmons , whose mathe matical mind began to grasp the solution of the difficult problem . " You 'll make two or three trips with her . " " Of course . " " 0 , that quite alters the case . " " Bless your heart , of course it does . " " Will we want any provisions ? " asked Bart . " Provisions ! What for ? " " Are we going to camp out ? " /z/ " 0 , no . We 'll return to the vessel . But pro visions ! 0 , yes , we 'll want a lunch ashore , of course . " And now began the process of disembarkation . Messrs . Simmons and Long , with two boys , went first . A number of baskets of provisions were thrown in , and the mate sculled them ashore . On his return five more boys were ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generously waited till the last . The loss of their hats had been a sore grievance , but the handkerchiefs were not a bad substitute . Bart had his pistol in his belt , and a sailor 's knife . Bruce Rawdon had a beautiful little hatchet . The others had knives . When the boat returned , they were quite worn out with impatience , and were almost ready to jump overboard and swim ashore . But their time of waiting ended at last , and the boat landed them on the gravelly beach . It was about two o'clock when the party landed on the island . They had started at ten , three hours before high tide . The tide was therefore already beginning to turn , and would of course continue to run out till seven or eight . On this account , the schooner could not come any nearer for fear of being stranded . As they did riot intend to pass the night on the island , it was necessary , at all hazards , to keep the vessel afloat . Captain Corbet had selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all times of tide ; and though it was inconveniently distant , yet it was the only /z/ place for her under the circumstances . Mr. Sim mons had told Captain Corbet that he would leave the island in three hours , after which the schooner was to sail to a port a few miles off on the main land , and anchor for the night . He had also taken care to let all the boys understand these arrange ments perfectly , and had warned them not to be too far away when the hour for leaving might come . As the last of the passengers landed , they walked about the beach , looking up at the gigantic cliffs , picking up the stones and shells , and exulting in the novelty of their situation . The island was about half a mile long , and about half that width . The beach was narrow ; and the boys began to look , with longing eyes , to the summit of the island . In their wanderings they came across their companions . Mr. Simmons , followed by Bogud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Long , with Billymack , was working away near him . The baskets lay open , and all could help themselves to lunch . After satisfying their hunger , the " B. O. W. C. " quickly determined to explore the island thoroughly , with the hope of finding a wav to the top . With this intention they started off , and at length found a place which seemed to promise what they desired . It was at the end nearest to Pinnacle Island . A torrent had made a rough pathway for itself in that place , and though the stones were somewhat insecure , yet it seemed safe enough for active lads . /z/ Up this place , then , they tried to climb . The footing was very insecure , the loose stones con stantly rolling down , and making it dangerous for one to go behind another . It was so steep that they had to climb with hands as well as feet . They clutched the roots of trees , the long , tough grasses , and the thick ferns . Thus pulling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way up through all difficulties , they managed to scramble to the summit . /z/ Exploring a desert Island . Tumbling over a Cliff . Peril of Bruce . A mad How over the Waves . Adrift in the Fog . N reaching the summit , the triumphant , climbers gave vent to their feelings in loud shouts . Looking out from their lofty perch , a magnificent scene unfolded itself before their eyes . There was the broad expanse of water . In the distance , a kind of haze rested over the hills , which , to experienced eyes , would have been sig nificant of an approaching fog , but it gave no such warning to them . There rose Blomidon , always the supreme monarch of the scene . Around them were clustered the other islands ; and here , directly opposite them , and beneath them , was Pinnacle Island , with its cloud of screaming gulls . Yet it was not to these , or to any one of these , that the eyes of the boys were most attracted . There , beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater charm . It was the Antelope . There she swung at her anchor , while ever and anon the passing breeze , as it came by , swept out /z/ the folds of the black flag , ' from which that benevo lent face , which it bore , seemed to look up at them with a grin of welcome , encouragement , and sym pathy . It was another proud moment for the " B. 0 . " W. C. " After feasting their eyes on this fascinating flag , they all started off to explore the island . There was not much to explore ; but what there was , proved difficult . The trees grew densely , interla cing their branches , while beneath them was a thick growth of underbrush and ferns . Fallen trunks , teome fresh fallen , others half rotted , intercepted them at every step ; and they had to climb over them or crawl under . Progress was extremely difficult , and a good half hour was occupied in going from one end ' of the island to the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the cliff down the precipice into tke sea . Then they began to return , keeping along the edge of the island , where the trees and the underbrush wore not so dense . Beneath they could see Messrs . Simmons and Long diligently hammering away . Scattered along the beach were the other boys . In the air , abreast of them , the sea-gulls darted about with hoarse screams . One huge fellow flew straight toward them , without seeing them , carrying a fish in his claws . The sight of ' them so frightened him , that he dropped the fish , and flew off with a harsh shriek . On picking up the fish , they found it yet possessed of much vigor . Bruce /z/ took it and hurled it far out , and watched it to see where it would fall . It struck its own native ele ment , into which it sank ; and the boys generously hoped that it was able to resume its life , which had been interrupted by so wonderful a transition into the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way here much easier , and from time to time stopping to examine some object of interest , to dart into the woods after something that attracted their atten tion , or to lean over the cliff , and let stones fall , and watch them as they fell straight down , fajg down , till they struck the beach below . By and by they became scattered . Phil Kennedy and Tom Crawford had gone across the island . Arthur and Bart were walking on , and Bruce lin gered behind to try and find a gull 's nest , which seemed to be somewhere over the edge of the cliff . He lay down , and bent far over , and at length saw what he suspected . The gull that was on the nest flew away in affright , as she saw the face peering at her , and Bruce determined to seize the eggs . But how could he ? The nest was out of his reach . He scrutinized the place narrowly , and at last con cluded that it could be done . About three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could Stand ; and holding on to the root of a tree at the edge of the cliff with one hand , he could extend his other hand far enough to touch the nest . All this he saw , and at once began to make the /z/ attempt . The edge of the cliff was rocky , and hung over a foot beyond the precipice ; the pro jecting rock below did not come out so far . About five feet back , a tree grew , one of the roots of which had projected itself forward , and crooked itself along the edge , and the earth having been blown away , it was now exposed . This root Bruce grasped ; and lowering himself over the edge , he let himself down till his feet touched the shelf ; then lowering himself still more , he prepared to reach out his hand . But at that instant a thrill of horror shot through every nerve . The shelf on which he was standing seemed slowly to sink beneath him . Well for him was it at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that there had not yet been time to extend his arm to the nest . The thrill of horror transfixed him . He sprang up , and grasped the root with both hands . The next instant the shelf crumbled away , and his feet hung idly in the empty air . A wild shriek sounded out a shriek of mortal terror , that sent an icy chill to the heart of Bart and Arthur , and brought them back in mad anxiety and fear . Far below , Mr. Simmons had been busily ham mering at the cliffs . His basket was filled with unusually fine specimens , and he had just turned to send off Bogud with this basket to the landingplace . He was just in the midst of some directions about a peculiar hammer which he wanted , when /z/ suddenly an immense mass of rock came thundering down , and buried itself in the gravel , not ten feet in front of him . Mr. Simmons started back , and rushed far out from the treacherous precipice . Looking up with a white face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had fallen . He looked up . A deeper , deadlier pallor came to his face ; big drops started from his forehead ; a shriek escaped him . " 0 , God ! Who is it ? " he groaned . For there on the edge , grasping the tree-root with both hands , hung the figure of a boy writhing* as he sought to find some place for a foothold against the rock . Two figures were bending over . By the red shirts which all wore , he knew that the one in danger must be one of those five that had dressed themselves in this way . But which of them it was , he could not tell . ITis shriek roused others . Mr. Long came hur rying there , and the other boys , all looking up with eyes of horror and ashen lips . The moments of that suspense were agony . There was nothing that they could do . Mr. Long alone tried to do something . Starting off at full speed , he ran on , trying to find a place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the rest thought it was of no use , and awaited the end in voiceless horror . Meanwhile Bruce Rawdon had clung to the root , shrieking for help , and trying to find some /z/ resting-place for his feet . In vain he tried . The precipice retreated inward , and the shelf that had fallen left a deeper hollow behind . Almost sense less with the horror of his situation , he was con scious of nothing but the fact that friends were near ; and for these he shouted , clinging desperately to the root of the tree . Another boy might have fallen ; but Bruce 's muscles had been toughened by all kinds of manly exercise , and he had in him the germ and the promise of mighty strength and stature . , The shriek that roused Arthur and Bart was followed by others , which led them speedily to the place . With a groan Arthur flung himself down , and grasped his brother by the wrist . Bart took a swift glance around . A small tree was growing near the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body over the precipice , and caught Bruce by the waistband . Then , clutching the tree with his legs , he made a mighty effort to raise Bruce . The latter , in the mean while , had seized Arthur , who was also trying to raise him . But Arthur had not a fair chance to exert his full strength , and so they prevailed but little against the dead weight which they were trying to lift . " Arthur ! " cried Bart . " Well . " " Can you catch hold of this tree where my /z/ legs are ? Hold it with one hand , and then you can pull better with your other . Can you do it ? " " Yes . I 've got hold . " " Now then . " With a tremendous effort , both boys pulled together . The slender tree bent beneath their efforts . But the weight was raised ! Yes ! 0 , thank God ! higher higher ! There was Bruce 's head at the edge , and now his shoulders . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convulsive effort , had flung himself forward , and was on the rock . They dragged him forward . He was saved . Arthur burst into tears , and held Bruce in his arms . Bart rushed off for water . Returning in a few minutes with his leathern cup , which he always carried , full of cold Avatcr , he gave it to Bruce . The fainting boy drank it , and then drew a long breath . " God bless you , boys ! " he said at last , wring ing the hand of each . lie would have said more , but he could not . " I 'll be all right presently , " said he , taking a long breath . " My heart feels painful ; " and he pressed his hand against his breast . " Do n't bother any more , Bart . I 'm coming round fast . Just let 's sit here , and be quiet for a little while . " They sat there in silence for some time ; and gradually the color began to come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushwood was heard , J Mr. Long came running up to them , his face as pale as death , and his eyes round with the horror of a frightful suspense . The moment ho saw the little group , he flung himself on his knees by Bruce , and , catching him in his arms , he kissed him again and again . " Thank God ! 0 , thank God ! " he moaned , and burst into tears . Hitherto Mr. Long had the reputation , among the boys , of being a hard , unfeeling man ; but from that moment this opinion was changed . Mr. Long said nothing more at that time , partly because he did not wish to distress Bruce by any questions just then , and partly because he was so faint , from the tremendous rush up the cliff , that he could not speak . In fact , for a time he seemed as much broken as Bruce . So they sat quietly together waiting . Mr. Long 's effort was a desperate one , but the only thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they could not have drawn up Bruce , might have held him there for a long time , and in that case Mr. Long would have been there to save him . After about an hour , Bruce said he was all right , and they walked toward the place of descent . It seemed , indeed , as though he had got over his accident . He said his arms ached a little , and there was a slight pain in his breast , but that it /z/ was passing away . The descent was toilsome , but Bruce accomplished it as well as any of them . By the time he reached the shore , he declared himself perfectly well . Mr. Simmons was there to meet him . He wrung his hand very earnestly , with tearful eyes , but did not trust himself to speak . Then Bruce told all about it , ' and the excitement of this adventure put an end to all further search for minerals . At length five o'clock came , and they prepared to go back to the schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current was running past them . The water was not so placid as it had been , but was getting broken up , and somewhat rough . The wind had changed , and was blowing more freshly than before . There were also gather ing fog banks , which were drawing nearer every moment , and threatening soon to be around them . All things showed , therefore , that it was high time to retire . Signals were made , and before , long they saw the boat leave the schooner , and come to the shore . On landing , the mate wanted to know if any of them could scull a boat . Bruce said that he could , and so did Arthur and Bart . The mate said that he wanted to stay aboard to get the sails ready ; and to save time , it Avould be necessary for some one of them to bring - the last boat aboard . Each one of these three offered to scull her ; but it was at last decided that Arthur should go in the second /z/ oat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load . Bart readily gave up his claim to the others ; and so it was arranged . " But are you sure you 're strong enough for that ? " said Mr. Long . " Strong ? Of course . " said Bruce . " I 'm stronger than ever , sir . " So the first boat started with the same load which it had when landing before , with the addi tion of one boy more . The next boat took Arthur and four more boys , leaving Bruce , and Tom , and Phil , and Bart . About an hour had passed between the time when the boat left to take them from the island and the time when Arthur brought it back for the last trip . In that hour many changes had taken place . The tide had fallen farther . Between the beach , where they stood , and Pinnacle Island , the rocks were laid bare , and could be traversed on foot . Between the schooner and the shore , a swift current was running , which ' grew stronger every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The mate , on his second trip , had con siderable difficulty . in getting to the schooner ; and he had given very careful directions to Arthur as to the course which he should go in returning . " You must head the boat farther up , " said he , " so as to strike the schooner fair . I did n't cal'late right about that there tide . You 've got to head your boat well off that side , and then the tide 11 help you instead of henderin ' . " /z/ " All right , " said Arthur . In going ashore , ho found the current very strong ; but the beach was long , and , of course , it was very easy to land somewhere . As it happened , he was carried down some fifty feet below the place which he wished to reach ; but that did n't make any practical difference . It served to open his eyes to the peculiar danger before them , and made him see that the very greatest care would have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweep them away from the place to which they wished to go . As Arthur looked round , after the other boys had got in , an exclamation burst from him . Whew ! " " What 's the matter ? " * " Why , the fog . How suddenly it has come up ! Why , it 's getting as thick as night . Look here , Bruce ; we 've got to be pretty careful this time . See here ; you must head out that way , for the cur rent is running like a race-horse , and this fog is n't helping matters . " He then proceeded to explain to Bruce the best course to take , and Bruce said he would do exactly as he told him . " You 're sure you can do it . You 're sure you 're not used up at all , " said Arthur . " Not a bit of it ! " said Bruce , with a laugh . " If I feel used up , I 'll hand over the oar to you or Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous pushes , and the boat moved in the direction indi cated by Arthur . Bruce soon found that Arthur had not exag gerated the force of the current . It seemed to drag the boat sidewise with fearful power . But a strong hand was at the scull , and the boat 's course was true , and every moment brought them nearer . As they went , the fog grew thicker at every foot . The wind blew more strongly , and the water grew rougher , making the progress of the clumsy boat more difficult . Soon the shore grew in distinct ; but this they did not regard , since their eyes were fixed on the schooner , to which they drew steadily nearer . There , on board , stood the other boys ; and Mr. Simmons was talking to Cap tain Corbet , and Mr. Long was watching them with some anxiety . The mate stood near the bow with a rope , ready to throw as soon as they should come within reach . But though near enough to see all this , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort . For now the farther out they went , the stronger grew the current ; and Bruce felt a heavier drag against the boat , and gathered up his strength for sterner exertions . He took a hasty look at the schooner , so as to get her bearings , and then headed the boat at a sharper angle against the current . This was admirably calculated ; and /z/ now the boat foil off less , and seemed to work itself steadily toward the schooner . Arthur was in the bows , anxiously watching the boat 's course . The other boys sat in silence , con scious of the hazard before them , but facing it bravely . On board the schooner not a word was spoken . Mr. Long 's face seemed to grow more anxious . His hands clutched one another with a rigid grasp , and his eyes seemed fastened on Bruce . The mate stood with his rope , not ventur ing to make any suggestion , for he saw that Bruce was doing all that could be done . His forehead was contracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself ( from a habit that he had acquired ) , and which , in him , was a sign of grave perplexity of soul . Nearer and nearer came the boat ; but the anx ious watchers began to see that the current was swerving them off more rapidly than they had ex pected , and that the angle of the boat 's drift would lie not so near as they hoped . Bruce saw this , and summoned up a new force out of his strong muscles . A few mighty strokes , and something was gained even against the pressure of that tremendous current . There was the schooner . On on ; nearer nearer . They had hoped to touch her bow ; but now they saw it would be well if they could get near her stern . Back ran the mate with his rope . Not a word was spoken . No one ventured to call for /z/ greater exertions from that brave , strong boy , who was plying his oar so mightily . And now the mo ment had come . Forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . Arthur 's hands were extended to seize it . Bruce did not abate one stroke , but . worked with desperate energy . The boat was borne past the schooner 's quarter . The rope touched Arthur 's right hand , his fingers closed around it . Alas ! it was but the extreme end of the ropo that he held ; and before his other hand could seize it , it had slipped through his fingers , and fell into the water . " Row , row , Bruce ! I 've dropped the rope ! " A groan burst from Bruce . He gave three tre mendous strokes . They were the last efforts of despairing energy . As he moved his arms to mako the fourth , he staggered back . The oar fell from his nerveless grasp . He sank down , with a groan , at the bottom of the boat . " Boys , I I 'm dying ! " Gasping out these words , Bruce closed his eyes , and lay motionless . A cry of dismay and terror burst from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were turned toward the boat , which noAv , hurled on by the swift current , was borne farther and farther away , until at last it vanished from view in the fog . /z/ Up Anchor and after them . Mast of the FogHorn . A long Search amid Mists , and Dark ness , and Storms . IS the boat drifted away from the schooner , horror for a time seemed to have struck dumbness into all on board . From this stupor Mr. Long was the first to rouse himself . " Captain , " he cried , " we must up sail and after them . " " Which way shall we go ? " " After them any way . Follow the poor lads be fore they get any farther . Come , boys , up with the anchor ! Corbet , up with your sails 1 " The way that anchor was walked up was a won der . In an incredibly short space of time the schooner was dashing through the water , swept on by wind and tide . " Which Avay does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , right round the island , and down to Biomidon , and then out into the Bay of Fundy . " " I ca n't see the island .

Their oar 's gone that 's the mischief of it . " Mr. Long looked gloomily around . " The only thing , then , is for us to follow on where they may be drifting . " " You 've hit the nail on the head , sir . There 's nothin ' else for us not a hooter . " " How far is the main land from here ? " " Several miles . " " Does the current strike near it anywhere ? " " Xo , sir ! It goes straight in a bee line for Blomidon . " " After leaving this island , then , Blomidon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Parrsboro ' . " " How long will it take them to drift there ? " " About three hours . " " How far will they be likely to drift ? " " Let me see . It 's seven o'clock now . It 's nearly dead low tide . It 'll be on the flood soon , and by the time them there lads get to Blomidon , there 'll be a flood tide . " " And how will that be for them ? " " It 'll drift ' em back . " " In which direction ? " " Wai , sir , it would take a man with a head as long as a hoss , tail and all , to answer that there /z/ pint . Lor ' bless you , in this here bay there 's no knowin ' where the tide ' 11 drift a man . " " If it were n't for the fog , there 'd be no danger , " said Mr. Long , musingly . " That there 's an ondeniable fact , at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue ? " Captain Corbet screwed his head round in the direction of the wind , and drew up his face into a most extraordinary grimace . " Well , I rayther think , " said he , slowly , " that you 've got me there . " " You do n't know , then , anything about it , " said Mr. Long , impatiently . " Not a hooter . " Mr. Long walked away , and looked mournfully out over the dim sea . Deep sadness and sore anxiety now reigned over the little vessel . Mr. Simmons said not a word , but sat staring fixedly at the fog . The boys stood in silent groups . Not a word was spoken . Mr. Long walked forward to the bows , and looked out . The wind was increasing , and the sea was growing rougher . Evening was passing away , night would come and then , what ! To think of those poor lads in the boat was anguish . He walked back again to Captain Corbet . " Where are we now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island . " " I ca n't see it . " " No , I have to give her a wide berth . It 's low tide , and the ledges are dangerous . " /z/ " Do you think the boat may be drifting out here , or nearer in shore ? " " Wai , accordin ' to my cal'lation , they 'd oughter be out here somewhere . Jedgin ' by the direction the boat took , I should say I was followin ' pooty close in their track , though there 's no knowin ' for sartin . " " Ought n't we to be up to them by this time ? " " Wai , I do n't know . You saw the pace they went off at . Geeracious ! Talk of race-hosses ! Why , that boat went off at a rate to beat all crea tion holler ! " " But we 're going faster . We have the same current , and we 've got sails up . " " Never a truer word ; but then it took some time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gracious ony knows where they 've got to . The ony thing that we 've got to do , as I can see , is to keep follerin ' our noses right straight on , and keep in the current . " Suddenly a thought struck Mr. Long . Rushing down into the cabin , he returned with a fog-horn , and raising it to his lips , blew a long , piercing blast . " That 'll fetch ' em , if anything does , " said Cap tain Corbet . " Silence ! " cried Mr. Long , listening intently , while all others on board stood listening for the return cry . But no sound came back . " They 've got a pistol , and if they hear us , they would fire . Have you a gun , captain ? ; ; /z/ " Nary gun . " " This born , then , is the best thing . Shouting is of no use/ ' said Mr. Long ; and he blew another blast . Again they listened , and again there was no re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an anguish of expectation , there came no answer ing cry , no shout , no pistol shot nothing but the plash of waves near by , the singing of the wind through the rigging , and the boom of the surf on some distant beach which the fog hid from view . On went the schooner , and Mr. Long blew unweariedly , clinging to this horn as something by which he still might gain access to the lost boys , and finding in this occupation something of that antidote to pain which action of any kind yields to the energetic nature . But time passed on , and only the winds heard these shrill blasts , and only the winds responded to the signal . So darkness came upon them , and night ; and the darkness of this night was intensified by the thick fog , so that it became a darkness which might be felt . " Ef we want to save the boys , " said Captain Corbet at last to Mr. Long , who stood dejectedly near him , " my opinion is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rate we 're goin ' , it 's my opinion that before long we . ' ll be high and dry . And we may thank our blessed stars if we light /z/ on a mud flat , and do n't get dashed to small bits on Blomidon . Them 's my sentiments . " " Why , do n't you know where you are ? " " No more idee where I am than the man in the moon . " " I thought you knew the coast . " " Sol do like a book . " " What do you mean , then ? " " Why , if it was only the fog , I would n't mind ; but , mind you , there 's the tides . The flood tide ' 11 be coming along soon , and then where 'll we go to ? We may get twisted up into an eddy , and find our selves on Cape Split ; or we may glide up to Windsor , or get thrown on the rocks , goodness ony knows where . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their blessed hearts to drift us to . So the long and the short of it is , I move we anchor . " " But is n't it a common thing for schooners to drift about here ? " " Not in the Basin of Minas , thank you . No , sir . Not if they can help it . Out in Fundy it 's differ ent . Fundy hai n't got no bottom to anchor on , except near the shores . Fundy ai n't one universal mud bank , nuther . Out in Fundy every skipper cal'lates on driftin' ' , jest as a sea captain cal'lates on navigatin ' by scientific observation . Driftin ' in Fundy is a science by itself , and vessels make v'y'ges back'ard and for'ard by a new patent driftin' ' process . But in here nobody drifts . It 's no go . " /z/ Mr. Long gave a heavy sigh . " At any rate , let 's drift a little longer . I cling to hope of coming up with the boys . " " Comin ' up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've corned up with ' em and passed ' em long ago . We 've got on different tracks some how . Ef they 'd been afloat , they 'd never missed hearin ' that everlastin ' trumpet you 've been a-blowin ' on so like all possessed . " Now all this time since they had left the an chorage the . wind had been blowing strongly . A.s the darkness increased , Captain Corbet had taken in his foresail . The water grew rougher , the little schooner labored heavily , and pitched , and tossed , and rolled about , while the waves dashed over her bow . Mr. Simmons had retired to his berth with the bodily pangs of seasickness superadded to his mental anxiety . One by one the boys had disap peared below , and for an hour or more none were left on deck but Mr. Long , Captain Corbet , and the mate . A light had been hoisted , and Mr. Long still blew the fog-trumpet . But he no longer blew it with any hope . Cap tain Corbet had presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was , that they must be far away from any place where the boat could possibly be . They had sailed on and passed beyond them . They could not have been near the beat at any time . Some other current must have carried it away in another direction . Had it not been so , /z/ they must assuredly have heard those shrill yells , ind in that case they would have responded . Either they had been caught in another current , or else that had happened to them on which he dared not think . But then , even so , if they had got into another current , could it avail them ? For that boat to drift out into this sea would be sure destruction . " Captain , " said he , " are there more currents than one about those islands ? " " As many currents as there is hairs on a boss 's tail . " " Then it 's quite likely they got into another one . " " It 's sartin . " " Can you conjecture how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the current we came by was a kind of inside one that took us round the nighest island . Now , outside of that there was another current that kind b ' goes round the next island , which is a bigger one than the one we were at . I 've been turnin ' it over in my head , and I cal'late that that there boat , jedgin ' by the course she took as she shot by us , got swept into the outer current , and was driven away around the outer island . " " We could n't have been near her at all , then . " " It seems not . " " Where* could they have been when we began to blow ? " " As near as I can cal'late , jedgin ' by the natur ' /z/ of the currents , and the course they took , they might have been off the farthest end of the other island . " " How far away from the place where we were ? " " Over two miles yes , more'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear one of these fog-horns ? " " About a mile . " " So they could n't have heard us ? " " Could n't have heard a note . No , sir . And that accounts for their silence . " " Whore does the current go to , after going round that island you speak of ? " " Wai , there 's a good many , but there 's two main currents : one goes round the island , and returns and jines the one that we come down by . " " And if the boat came by that , it would be behind us . " " Jes so . " " About how far ? " " 0 , ten miles . or more by this time . " " If so , every moment now takes us farther from them . " " That 's about it , anyway you take it . But the flood tide 's catching us now , and where it 's takin ' us to 's more'n I know . " " It will take the boat too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You spoke of another current . " " Yes , the other current sweeps around farther up , nigh unto the main land , and takes a turn and /z/ comes down , till it jines the gen'ral current along with the others . " " So , if they had drifted into that , they would still be behind us . " " Of course . " " Where do you think we are now ? " " Ca n't tell . Somewhere near Blomidon , though perhaps I 'm jest as near Horton Bluff ' . " " How far would the boat drift till the tide turns ? " " Wai , they would have time to drift nearly to Blomidon . " " And when the tide turns , you ca n't tell where they 'd go ? " " No , sir nor nobody else . " " What chance would there be of the boat keep ing afloat ? " Captain Corbet shook his head . " It 's rough precious rough . Ef it had been any other boys than them there partic'ler boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be swamped , sure as a gun . But them there boys is oncommon lively creeturs . An ' they 've got a great idea of a rowboat , though they do n't know nothin ' of sailin ' . They 'd manage to keep afloat as long as anybody I know of . They 'd make a precious hard fight of it afore they 'd knock under , mind , I tell you . They 're boys that are up to snuff . They mind me of my babby . My babby is the cutest little creetur that ever I see in all my born days . Why , that there /z/ infant last week jest a week ago to-morrow that there infant hallo ah hur why , I declare Mr. Long why , he 's gone , an ' has n't hoard about the infant . " It was a fact . Mr. Long had gone , and had lost the story of the infant . A moment afterward the shrill blast of the horn sounded out over the deep . " Captain , " said he , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any more to your anchoring . Do as you choose . God alone knows what is best to do . He alone can save those dear boys . I must try to trust them to him . " A few moments after , the vessel was swinging at ' her anchor in twenty fathoms water . Captain Corbet and the mate calmly retired to sleep , leaving the schooner to take care of herself . But there was one who slept not all through that night . Mr. Long could not leave the deck . The air below was stifling to one so full of anxiety and suspense as he was . All night long he paced the deck with unwearied footsteps , all night long , stopping at times to sound his trumpet ; stopping again to peer through the thick darkness that hung around like a funeral pall over the grave of the departed . There , too , over and over again in the darkness and the gloom of that night , he knelt down on that deck , and poured forth all the anguish of his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone is able to save . After each prayer his soul would grow calmer , and the storm of his agitated /z/ eart would cease for a time , till , gradually reas signing its strength , his grief would once more return , to be once more dispelled by prayer . So , amid vigil , and fasting , and prayer , and grief , passed the night away ; and when the dawn came , there stood this man looking out over the sea , with a face pale from suffering , and eyes dimmed " with unfa miliar tears . The dawn of day brought at least one comfort . The wind had changed during the night , and the fog had gone . The wide sea once more unfolded itself , and as the light grew stronger , Mr. Long eagerly scanned it in all directions in search after the lost ones . At last , rousing Captain Corbet and the mate , he urged them to set sail once more . Captain Corbet came on deck , and looked round in great curiosity to see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance of his where abouts , and it had been an interesting problem as he dozed off to sleep . The moment he looked around , he uttered a cry . " Good gracious ! " Mr. Long looked inquiringly at him . " Ef I ai n't back at my own door ! Do n't you see it , Mr. Long ? Why , darn me , ef we have n't drifted clean back to Grand Pre* ! " Mr. Long looked in wonder to where Captain Corbet pointed , and there , to his surprise , he recog nized the - familiar shore . A cloud came over his brow . The thought of the lost ones came to him /z/ more vividly as he saw the place which might pos sibly be doomed to know them no more forever . " Ef it war n't - dead low tide , " said Captain Cor bet , " darn it ef I would n't have a good mind to tie up the old Anty to the nighest stump , and take a run up to see the babby . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Corbet was awed . " 0 I did n't mean it . I I ony made the re mark . Of course I did n't mean it it 's ony a leetil outbust of parential affection . " " Come , make haste ! " said Mr. Long , sternly . " There 's no time to lose . We must scour the bay till we find the boys . " The anchor went up , and up went the sails , and the Antelope once more spread her wings to the blast , and went over the waters . But where could they go ? That was the question which it was difficult to answer . Where , or in what direction , east , west , north , or south ? Through all that day they sailed about . First , they went down the straits past Blomidon ; then , turning back , they stretched away far over to the farthest extremity of the bay . They spoke what vessels they met . They watched every floating object , and it was with a feeling of relief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shingle , or a log , and never into a hat or the seat of a boat . So passed the day . /z/ Searching in such a way , without any clew , it ras difficult for them to feel that they were doing mything . While they were searching in the east , the traces of the object of their search might all be in the west ; and while they were examining the north , the boat might be drifting in the south ; or , while they were in the Basin of Minas , the boat might be helplessly carried about by the currents of the Bay of Fundy . One thing there was to comfort them ; and that was , the departure of the fog , the clear atmosphere , the pleasant breeze , the bright sunshine . Several vessels had been met with , and all had promised to keep a lookout and engage other vessels in the same service . On such a sea , and under such a sky , there could be no danger , if the boat had sur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night ? Alas ! and alas ! who could answer that ! Mr. Long , at any rate , would not give up . As though in defiance of fate , he would not haul down that flag which Bart had hoisted , but kept it flying , in the fond hope that it would once more greet their eyes . /z/ Lost in the Fog . At the Mercy of the Tide . The last Rock . Wanderings on a lonely Shore . A great Discovery . A new Mode of Cooking . jEANTIME , what had become of the boys ? Was the " B. 0 . W. C. " thus overwhelmed beneath the dark wave ? Were all the grief , and the watching , and the tireless search of the noble-hearted Mr. Long to be unavailing ? We shall see . As the boat sped away , dragged on by the swift current , the boys sat in astonishment and conster nation . Bart supported Bruce 's head , and Arthur hurried to the stern to assist . They wet his pale brow in silence ; while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been seized with a sudden spasm . He soon felt better , though unable to exert himself . By that time the fog had closed in around them , and both the schooner and the shore had been shut out from their view . They were drifting swiftly on , they could not tell where . For a long time they sat watching and waiting how long they did /z/ not know . In seasons of suspense , moments are olonged to hours ; and so it was here . On they went , and still on . Each one well knew all the possibilities of the danger that lay before them . There was a wide and a wild sea , overspread with fog-clouds , where the waves were rising and the night was coming down . Into the midst of all this they were being borne by swift currents . This they all knew , yet not a sound of dismay escaped any one of them . Whatever each one may have felt of fear , he sat in silence and gave no sign . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that awaited , undismayed , the terrors of the deep . Bart was the first to rouse himself . " Boys , " said he , drawing forth a tin pail from tinder the scat , " we must fight for our lives , and make up our minds to pass the night here . We 'll have to use this concern , I think . " " Here 's something , too , that may be of use , " said Arthur , drawing out a narrow plank from the bottom of the boat . " Phil , there 's another one ; just draw it out . " Phil reached down for it , but Tom Crawford dragged it out first . " I 'm stronger than you , Phil , " said he . " If there 's to be any paddling , I 'll do it . " Meanwhile Arthur drew his knife , and began cutting at the plank so as to fashion it into an oar . Tom did the same . /z/ Soon they were interrupted by a shout from Bart . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Look ! look ! " and he pointed to the left . True enough , there was the dim outline of black cliffs rising high not far away . Past these they were drifting . In an instant Arthur and Tom put out their planks , and began to use them as paddles , in the Indian fashion , heading the boat toward the shore , and putting forth all their strength . Bart , too , tried to use his dipper for a paddle . The boat drifted on ; but the current swept them in nearer and nearer . Some progress was also made by the paddles , rude though they were . Borne on by the tide , the boat every moment drew nearer to the shore ; yet every moment it was swiftly drifting by , and it now became a question whether it would be at all possible for them to reach the land . Already they could see the end of the island , a precipitous cliff , not far away , toward which they were drifting . A few minutes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . At its base there was a ledge of rocks , which ran down into the water . At this low tide the ledge extended for a long distance , and terminated in a projecting mass , which was covered with an immense growth of sea-weed . Around this point the current passed , and it was to this that the boat was speeding . /z/ And now all their exertions were put forth to extricate the boat from the central grasp of the current . Already , thanks to their former exer tions , they had forced it from the centre to the edge of the tide , and a few more vigorous efforts might bring them to the shore . . But so swift was the tide , that it seemed about to snatch them away from that shore when it was just within reach . It seemed as though they could almost have waded ashore if they had jumped overboard . But that , of course , could not be done , for the power of the current would have swept any one away who should try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide brought a counteracting influence ; and for every six inches of forward motion , there were two feet of sidelong drift . The boat 's head was toward the shore , but her motion was broadside ; and so the shore seemed ever near , yet inaccessible , and most unattainable when most within reach . And so on past the whole length of the island , until the cliff at the farthest extremity was reached and passed . They were but ten feet from the shore . The rocky ledge , covered with sea-weed , still extended before them . It was to this that they now tried to force the boat . Ten feet ! Only ten feet ! And the ten feet lessened to nine , and the nine to eight , and the eight to seven , and the seven to six . But six feet between them and the shore ! /z/ But six feet ! Would they could they fail at last ? Six feet only ! But the tide was wild and strong , and now , at this last orisis of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prey was escaping from his power . It was as though his grasp was fastened on them with a fiercer clutch and a more desperate tenacity , as though , at this supreme hour , he had risen in his might , and , even at the very gate of his domain , had seized them , and was trying to draw them to destruction . But six feet ! Yet between them and the rock of their hope , even in those few feet of watery distance , what risks and dangers lay what chances of loss what baffled hopes what despair ! The suspense was anguish . On they went with the fury of the torrent . " 0 , why have n't I a paddle ! " groaned little Phil Ken nedy . Bruce raised himself , and looked around , with his pale face and staring eyes . Arthur , and Tom , and Bart put forth their last energies . Four feet ! ' Not a word was spoken . The tightly com pressed lips , the resolute eyes , the frowning brows of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heaving breasts told how heavily they labored with their clumsy , unwieldy oars . A roar sounded in their ears to the right . It was the rush of the current as it swept past the extreme verge of the ledge . There was the open /z/ lay their last chance ; beyond it de- new it they felt it . That sound struck on their ears like the knell- of doom . One last effort one superhuman struggle . Nearer came the boat ; although even then trembling on the ex treme verge , yielding to the current , it turned slightly , bringing its head closer to the rock . It was done . In an instant , arms were outstretched , and Bart 's hands were clinging to the sea-weed . For a mo ment the boat was checked . Tom Crawford and Phil Kennedy grasped the sea-weed also ; and at that instant , Arthur , seizing the boat 's rope , sprang ashore . His leap jerked the boat , which , caught by the tide , was swept off , leaving masses of sea-weed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys . A cry of despair arose . But Arthur held the rope wound about his ands . As the boat moved , he steadied his feet or the struggle . The swift tide bore it off . As . he rope tightened out , the fury of the current , driving against the boat , contended with the strength of that one boy . For a moment it was the boy who lost . At the first jerk , his feet slipped on the treacherous sea-weed . He fell . He was dragged toward the water . No sound escaped from those in the boat , not word either of fear for themselves or of en- /z/ couragement or warning to Arthur . Well they knew that Arthur would die on the rocks , or be drowned in the sea , rather than lose his hold of that rope , which , in his desperate purpose , he had twisted round his hands . For a few moments Arthur could not recover himself . On that slippery sea-weed there was no foothold . He was drawn nearer and nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last he saw the round top of a boulder a little on one side . To this he managed to work himself , letting the boat yield to the tide still more as he did so . A few steps , and he was there . He plunged into the water , he pressed his feet against that stone , and then , drawing himself back , he pulled with all his strength . The boat yielded . The power was now in his hands . Grasping the rope nearer , he drew the boat in more closely , and at last it touched the shore . They were saved at last ! Out leaped Bart into the water , and , holding the boat , he added his strength to that of Arthur . The others followed as quickly as possible . Bruce had begun to regain his strength once more , and was able to get out without help . The unpar alleled exertions which he had undergone on the cliff had given a severe strain , which , in his final struggle to reach the schooner , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was now rallying /z/ once more . Joy at reaching the land did much to restore him , and he was soon able to start wherever the others wished to go . Their first movement was to go away from the ledge farther up to the beach . The rocks were flat , and not very difficult to walk over . They towed the boat as they went , which was a difficult task , but successfully accomplished . After severe exertions , they at length brought the boat about a quarter of a mile up to a place where there was an indentation in the line of shore , and - scarcely any current . Here they hauled it up some dis tance , and fastened it securely . After this they went up to the gravelly beach at the foot of the cliff , and sat down to rest for a while , and to con sider the situation . The fog was as thick as ever , and they could see but a little distance along the beach , or out on the water . The side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill wind . As to the boat , it was impossible to draw it up any farther . It would be necessary to wait until the tide rose higher , before they could bring it into a place of safety . But little coulcl be done , except watch it from time to time . It was now late , and darkness was coming on rapidly . Soon they would be surrounded by the impenetrable shades of night . Bart and Arthur offered to go along the shore and find some place where they could pass the night , leaving the others /z/ to watch the boat , and see if there were any signs of the schooner . But then the important question arose , what should they do for their suppers ? For a time this puzzled all of them . " I 'll tell you Avhat it is , boys , " said Bart at last ; " I think I know how to get something : We passed a place down on the shore where there were lots of mussels . Tom , you come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce may watch here . " This plan was eagerly adopted ; and as there was no time to lose , the boys set out . Fortunately , the place spoken of by Bart was not far away , and fortunately , too , the rocks were covered with shell-fish of different kinds , and the hollows of the rocks filled with them . Tom and Bart heaped them into their handkerchiefs . " Hallo ! " cried Bart , suddenly , in a joyous tone . " See here , Tom . " " What ? " . " Come here . " Tom went , and t found Bart plunging his handa most vigorously into a pool of water , which the re treating tide had left in a rocky hollow . " What have you got there ? " " I call them shrimps , " said Bart , holding one up in his hands . " They 're rather small , though . Go about and hunt up another hole . " Tom went off , and in a short time called to Bart in a loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him with a large , dark object in his hand . " A lobster ! " cried Bart . " A lobster ! Hurrah ! and hurrah again ! Tom , you 've saved us all from starvation . Good on your head . We need n't wait here any longer , for it 's getting dark , and we 'll have to join the other fellows . ' ' On returning to Bruce , they displayed their treasures , to the great delight of all . Arthur and Phil had also been successful . Walking farther up the beach , they had come to the end of the cliff , and reached a steep , well-wooded bank . It was not far away , and there were fir trees , from which they could easily cut enough brush to make very comfortable beds . There was also plenty of drift-wood , with which they could make a fire . Without any more delay , the boys all started off , first marking the place so as to know where to go for the boat . Reaching the bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which they built a fire on the beach at the foot of the cliff , where it adjoined the bank . They had plenty of matches in their pockets , and soon the fire Avas lighted ; the flames rushed fiercely through the inflammable brush-wood , and the boys kept gather ing fresh fuel from all sides and heaping it on . " And now to cook our tea , " said Bart . " Let 's get a lot of stones , and put them in the fire till they get red hot . Then we can draw them out , and roast all our shell-fish splendidly. " /z/ This suggestion was at once acted on , and the boys gathered stones and threw them in . After this they all went to work collecting drift wood from all sides , till a large pile was heaped up , sufficient to last them through the night . Then , in turn , each one took the hatchet and went up the bank , and cut as much fir-brush as he considered necessary for a bed . The darkness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towering flames , as they leaped up , illumined the scene , affording them sufficient light to cut the brush , and throwing a strong glare along the beach as far as the place where their boat lay . And next , they pulled out the stones from the fire , and arranging some of them in the sand , they laid the lobster on the top , and piled other stones around them , till the lobster lay buried in an oven as good and as serviceable as that of the best kitchen range . A number of shell-fish were thrown on other stones , and the shrimps were easily cooked by being laid on the top of a hot stone for a few minutes . While waiting for the lobster , they appeased their hunger by cooking and eating these smaller fry . " I never ate baked lobster , " said Bruce ; " but I 've heard that it 's the best thing there is . " " We 'll soon judge for ourselves , " said Bart . " Only before we fairly sit down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up farther . " Four of them started off . They found that /z/ already the tide had risen so far that it was level with the bows . A long and vigorous exertion enabled them to draw it up farther , and then they went back to the fire . By that time it was decided that the lobster had been baking long enough , and it was accordingly uncovered . A cry of delight escaped them . There lay the lobster , brilliantly red , as though red hot from the oven , and showing clearly the ex cellence of Bart 's contrivance . " That 's the way the Micmacs manage , " said Bart . " And they would n't look at a lobster that came out of a pot . " Ranging themselves around the lobster , in front of the fire , the boys now began their repast . One and all pronounced it glorious . It was salt enough and juicy enough to satisfy the most delicate palate ; and the severe exercise and long fast of the boys had given them appetites which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , boys , " said Bart , " here we are on a desert island , without a penny in our pockets ; but it is n't a bad place , after all . " " I wonder if they will hunt after us . " " Of course they will . " " They ought to see this fire , at any rate . " " I thought of that , and expected to see some signs of them before this . " " Perhaps it 's too foggy. " /z/ " 0 , if they were within a mile of us , they 'd see that light . " " I should think , if they came after us , they would have been within that distance . " " 0 , we ca n't tell . They may have got into another direction altogether . " " " Well , I suppose they 'll find us some time . " " I 'm sure I do n't care . " ' - Nor do I. " ' " Nor I. " Nor I. " " We 'll have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll explore it , and build our camp . It 's lucky we have a hatchet and a pistol . " " It 's lucky we have lobsters . " " 0 , we 'll find lots of other things . There are sea-gulls ' eggs , I 'll bet . " " And clams . " " And perhaps oysters . " " We 'll have to organize a government , and build a town . Wigwams will make the best houses . " " No spruce camps . " " 0 , wigwams are the only things that will keep the rain off . " " I wonder if we can find any birch bark . " " We must explore to-morrow . " " There 's one thing more to do to-night , " said Arthur . " For my part , I do n't want to have to run down to that miserable boat every ten minutes till high tide . I 've had enough of her for one day . THEY SLEEP . Ill We must get her up now . There 's a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as rollers ; so let 's go and get the boat up now . " This proposition was at once acted on . Four good round sticks were found , and some others to serve as levers . With these the boys started off to move the boat . They found it hard work , but practicable . The progress Avas slow , and it took a good hour ; but at last they had the ' satisfaction of seeing the boat above high-water mark , and fastened to a piece of projecting rock . Then they selected sleeping places , and spread their beds . After this they heaped up fresh fuel , and sat around the fire , making a hundred plans for their desert life . Arthur was the only one who did anything . He had found a piece of tough spruce , and with hatchet and knife was busily shaping it into an oar . At last they all retired to their Beds , and slept . /z/ Slue Sky . Building a House . The Signal Staff . A fatal Disgust . Mournful Forebodings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite refreshed , in spite of their unaccustomed beds . They gathered the embers of the fire together , and heaping on fresh fuel , started it into a blaze . Then they proceeded to secure a breakfast . This could not be immediately attended to , however , for the tide was not at its lowest ebb , and it was necessary to wait for two ' or three hours . Enough shell-fish remained to stay their appetites till something better could be pro cured . To their great joy , they saw that the fog had all gone . A warm , fresh breeze was blowing , the sky was clear and cloudless , and the sun rose brilliantly , casting his dazzling rays in a radiant flood of lustre across the sea . If there had been any feeling of discontent , it would have been dispelled by the grandeur of the scene . Some eight or ten miles away they saw the main land . Far away , on the ether side of the bay , they /z/ saw a line of hills , terminating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach , they saw lying beyond this island the one on which they had landed the day before . They now knew that they had drifted past that , and had gone ashore on the adjoining one , and they could understand the whole of that course which they had made blindly through the fog . It was with much eager ness that they looked around for the schooner . But they saw no traces of her whatever . The place where she had anchored was plainly dis cernible , but she had gone . It was not difficult to know the reason of this , since it was the very thing which they expected would happen . But where was the schooner now ? Which way had she gone ? When would she return ? How could those on board possibly find them out ? All these were questions which it was not easy to answer . While waiting for the tide to fall , they wandered up the banks in order to select some place suitable for a camp . It was not long before they settled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built the fire , the cliff ended , and the side of the island became a wooded slope . About fifty feet above the fire , there was a broad , open plat form , free from trees and covered with moss . Walking on beyond this , they ascended to the edge of the cliff , where it stood up two hundred feet above the shore . Here grew a solitary tree about fifty feet high , and very conspicuous from , its /z/ situation . Around it the rock was uncovered in places . The discovery of these places filled them with delight . They had already decided to build a camp , and the platform first mentioned seemed to all to be very suitable . " But we must find a spring somewhere , " said Bruce , who , after his night 's rest , declared himself as well as ever . " So we must , " said Bart . " Boys , let some of us hunt up a spring . " Off they went in different directions , and soon every one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that damp and well-watered country , springs can easily be found on every hill-side . The nearest one was the best , and by breaking away some of the earth and digging a hole with a stone in the clay of the bank , a well was rudely formed , which was suitable for all immediate needs . By the time they had finished these explorations , the tide was sufficiently low to admit of a search for their breakfast . All the boys went off , since all were equally interested . The search was perfectly successful , resulting in the capture of thirteen lob sters and a great quantity of shrimps . Bringing back their prey in triumph , they heated a large number of stones and cooked all the lobsters together , partly for the sake of keeping them bet ter , and partly that they might have a good supply of ready-cooked provisions on hand . /z/ " Do you know , boys , " said Phil Kennedy , as they sat at breakfast , " I 've got an idea ? " " Good for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we ought to have a signal . " " That 's true . " " Well , my plan is to have a signal up there , " said Phil , pointing to the solitary tree on the top of the cliff . " How can you manage it ? " " Why , turn that tree into a flag-staff by cutting off the branches . I can climb it , and if I can have now , Phil , " said Bruce , " I call that a firstrate idea . But where will you get a flag ? " " I 'll fasten my red shirt on . " " Hurrah ! " cried all , clapping Phil on the back . " Phil , you 're a genius . " " Talking about signals , " said Tom Crawford , " a flag wo n't be enough . We want something for nights and for foggy days . We ought to build a heap of dry brush and kindling , and be ready to light it at a moment 's notice . Perhaps it would be too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes ; it would , " said Bruce . " The best thingwould be to have a pile ready to light . But the first thing to do is to build our camp , and we 'll have lots of brush ready for the pile . Phil can have the hatchet to trim the tree after we have cut the poles and things for the camp . " /z/ " What kind of a camp shall we have ? " " A wigwam . " " Where 'll we get the birch bark ? " " Explore the island . " " That 'll take too much time . We want a camp to-day , and a camp we must have . The best way will be to build an ordinary one of poles and spruce 1 1 rush , and after that is built , we can look about for birch bark . " " And then I 've got my oar to finish , " said Ar thur , who had been working on it at intervals all the morning . " Well , " said Bart , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll want something to fasten it with . If you like , I 'll go and hunt after some roots that I know of . They 'll do first rate for ropes . " " All right ; and we 'll go and cut the poles . " Off they went , four of them after poles and brush , and Bart after roots for ropes . The hatchet served to cut the- poles , and the knives to trim them . Four industrious boys , working diligently at this , soon laid low a large number of straight , slender maple trees and an immense quantity of fir branches . These they all dragged to that plat form which they had selected as the site of their house , and then looked about to find the best situ ation for the temporary camp . As they expected to build a better one , they chose a place which would not interfere with any future operations . It was at the rear of the platform . Four trees /z/ grew there , at nearly equal distances , in the form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as part of the frame of the camp , and use them as corner posts . Bart had succeeded in finding an immense quantity of long , flexible roots , some of which were sassafras roots , others the long roots of willow trees , and all very tough and strong . First of all , they laid four of their strongest poles from tree to tree , the rear pole being about eight feet high , and the front one five feet . The side poles sloped up from front to rear . There they stuck a large number of poles into the ground in front , on the sides and in the rear , about a foot apart , leaving space for a door and a window . Then they laid poles over the top crosswise , so as to form a good foundation for a roof . All these were firmly fastened , so that at last , when the frame was completed , it was as secure as though it had been nailed together ; in fact , much more so . So far , all had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task was a more difficult one . This consisted in interweaving fir brush between the poles , so that they should be firm and strong . Beginning at the bottom , each bush was carefully inserted and pressed as closely down as possible . It was a tedious process ; but the five industrious boys worked unweariedly , and at last had the sat isfaction of seeing the rear and the right side com pleted . Then they concluded to rest for a while d dine . /z/ Cold lobster and cold water were all the fare that they could command ; but they ate with a good appetite , and greatly enjoyed the brief respite from their hard work . After this was over , they re turned to their task , and at length completed the front and the left side . Now the roof remained . This was the most difficult task of all . Three boys went on the roof , and two below handed up brush as fast as it was required . They began at the lower side in front , and inserted the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like thatch . The butt-end of each bush was inserted , and the brush ends pro jected . The flat branches of fir trees are of such a nature that they will lie very close to any surface on which they may be placed . These brushes were all placed in double layers ; each upper row over lapped the lower one ; and thus a roof was formed thick and close enough to turn any ordinary fall of rain , though , of course , it could not be expected to keep out the water in case of a prolonged storm . After the roof was all covered , the last brush at the upper edge was intertwined with others which were placed across them , and these again were all securely fastened to the poles below . Then their spruce camp was finished , and was almost an exact counterpart of the one which they had built in the woods . They had done it well and quickly , for long practice in this work in their own woods had given them great skill in the con struction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend to was the beds . All the brush that remained was brought inside , and laid lengthwise at the rear of the camp . Then they went into the woods , and gathered an immense quantity of dry , soft moss , which they spread over the spruce brush . In this way they formed a bed large enough for the whole party , as soft as a hair mattress , and as good as anything can be for the repose of a weary frame . This completed their work , and it was not yet sundown . They had worked nobly ; and when they stood out on the platform , and regarded their handiwork , their delight burst forth in ringing cheers . And now Phil claimed the hatchet , so as to carry out his cherished purpose of forming a signal staff . The others all went up to watch him at his work . Phil climbed up without any difficulty , and began at the upper branches , cutting away on a level with his waist , and using the lower ones to stand on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not large , and came tumbling down , beneath his strokes , with great rapidity . These the Doys below gathered together , and heaped up in a pile , at a sufficient distance off to burn without injury to the signal staff , and yet in such a situation that any flame would be conspicuous to those on the sea . The work was soon accomplished ; the last branch fell , and Phil descended to the ground . Where the tree had lately been there now arose a /z/ tall staff , naked , and ready to bear at its summit a red shirt , a pair of trousers , or anything else which the fancy of Phil might suggest as suitable to the place and the occasion . Meanwhile Arthur had gone to the beach , and returned with an armful of shavings and choppings from the wood which he had been trying to fashion into an oar . They were dry and fine , and were intended to serve as kindling whenever the time might come for kindling the signal fire . And now one thing more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fire on the platform in front of the camp a place which was greatly superior to the beach for such a purpose , and which also would give them the advantage of a warm fire on a cool evening , and a light close by their dwell ing-place . So they went out to collect drift-wood , and carried up a large quantity to the place . Good stones were also selected for cooking pur poses , and the cold lobsters were carefully brought from the beach , and deposited in the camp . But the labor of carrying the drift-wood up the steep bank showed them that it would be as well not to be too lavish with their fuel . In order to have the cheerfulness of brilliant light along with the grate fulness of warmth , they cut a quantity of brush , which they intended to throw on the fire from time to time . Thus , with a comfortable camp , and soft beds of moss , and plenty of fuel , and a pleasant fire , with food and drink , with fine weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " W. C. " might be con sidered as tolerably happy ; And so they would have been , if it had not been for one thing a thing which revealed itself to them during their evening repast , and soon threw a gloom over their prospects . It was dark ; the fire was lighted , and threw out a cheerful glow ; the cold lobster was brought out , and the boys began to partake . For some time nothing was said . At last the silence was broken by Bart . He* had been twisting a leg of the lobster fastidiously in his fingers , and nibbling little morsels of it , in a way which did not look very much like the fashion of a hungry boy who had done a good day 's work , when suddenly he flung the lobster 's leg into the fire . " I ca n't stand the abominable stuff any longer , " he cried . " Neither can I , " said Bruce . " Nor I " " Nor I " " Nor I " said all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all contemptuously thrown away . " AVhat are we going to do about it ? " asked Tom Crawford , mournfully . " I would n't care if there was even a raw po tato , " said Bart , " or a mouldy ship-biscuit , or an old dried turnip , or a bit of pork , or anything else to eat with it so as to take off the edge of it ; but to eat nothing else but this everlasting lobster , bster , lobster , is more than I can stand . " /z/ " Tea last night/ ' said Tom Crawford , dolefully , " lobster . Breakfast this morning , lobster . Dur ing the morning I felt hollow lobster . At dinner , lobster . For my part , I 've had enough of it . " " What can we do ? " " I 'm tired of shrimps . " " Bother shrimps. " " for a good slice of bread and butter ! " " Or a good mealy potato ! " " Or a beefsteak ! " " Or crackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? We 'll have to eat lobster , or starve . " " I feel , " said Phil , " ' that I 'm growing to be a lobster myself ; my skin is turning quite hard . " " I 'm beginning to lose faith in desert islands , " said Arthur . " Yes , they 're a failure . " " But how do we know ? " said Bart , " We have n't explored yet . We do n't know half of what may be on the island . " " We know pretty well what there is , " said Bruce . " Spruce trees , maple trees , moss , and rocks , that's* about all . " " Unfortunately , it is n't a South Sea island , and so we ca n't expect to pull cocoa-nuts from the trees , or have bread-fruit for our breakfasts . There are no mangoes , no bananas , no oranges , no grapes , no nothing , unless we choose to eat bark and fir cones . " /z/ " The next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we make tracks for the Pacific Ocean , " said Arthur . " I second that motion , " cried Phil . " It 's rather odd , " said Bart , " that all of us should get tired of lobster at the same time . " " It would be odder yet , " said Tom , " if any of us had been able to stand it any longer . " " That 's about the thing , " said Bruce . " And so the question remains yet , " said Arthur , " What are we going to do ? " No one answered . They all sat looking at the fire . Phil seized some brush and flung it on ; the flames caught it , and crackled through it , and dashed up fiercely and brightly , lighting up five very hungry , very tired , and very discontented faces . " Hurrah ! " cried Bart at last , starting to his feet . " Hurrah ! I have it ! " " What 's that ? " " Gulls ' eggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Bruce . " At any rate we can try it . Perhaps we may find some young gulls . They eat young rooks in England ; why should n't young gulls be good ? " " We 'll try it to-morrow , " said Tom . " At any rate , " said Bart , " it all comes to this . We must explore the island . I 've got my pistol . Who knows what may turn up . We may come across lots of rabbits , or , at any rate , wild fowl . /z/ Come , now , things are not so bad after all . To morrow will show us what the chances are for our dinner table . " This was now the only consolation they had . The lobsters had grown abhorrent , and they could not think of touching them any more . Hungry as they were after all their hard work , they threw aside the only food that they could get . They were compelled to go supperless to bed , and there dream of more agreeable food . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ; and soon all were wandering far away in the land of Nod . /z/ Exploring . A wild Walk . On the Lookout for Prey . Wliat is it ? Is it a wild Goose ? Tremendous Sensation , the Explorers being as much astounded as Robinson Crusoe was when he discovered the human Footprints in the Sand . N the following morning , all were up by day break , and Bruce could think of nothing but gulls ' eggs . In the desperate extremity of hunger to which they were reduced through their dislike to lobsters , they determined to make a search along the cliffs for nests . They walked along , and at length came to a place where some nests had been built . They found a large number of eggs here , and appropriated them all . On cook ing them , they found them of a peculiar flavor , yet eatable , and they congratulated themselves on their good luck . They now determined to put into execution their cherished plan of exploring the island . One was to stay behind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who it would be . It fell on Phil , who at once accepted his task with great /z/ cheerfulness , and informed them that he would make an omelet on a hot stone . In this pleas ing occupation they left him , and went into the woods . They found the woods here precisely like those of the other island . Fir , and spruce , and maple grew densely together , and beneath all there was a thick underbrush , with fallen trees , and ferns , and moss . Progress , under such circumstances , was exceedingly difficult ; but they knew that the island was quite small , and so they kept on their way . The grounds continually ascended for a long distance , and this , of course , added somewhat to the difficulty of the journey ; but at last the ascent ceased , and they knew that they were on the summit of the island . Nothing could be seen , however . So thick was the forest , that it shut out all the view ; nor was it of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were of nearly equal size , and if they were to climb up as far as they could , they would only find the view obstructed by the tops of trees grow ing around . So they kept on their way , and found the ground descending continuously in an easy slope . The wood was as dense as ever , and no living thing appeared . They had started with vague ideas of meeting with hares or wild fowl , but thus far nothing had been visible except the gulls overhead . They began to think that there was nothing but gulls on the island . Bart , how ever , assured them that they could not judge as /z/ yet , and expressed his unshaken confidence that he would start a rabbit before the day was done . He had his pistol in his belt , and he was determined to use it before going home , even if he had to shoot a gull . So they kept on down the descent , ex pecting every moment to come in sight of the bay . At last the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky through the trees . Moving farther forward , the trees grew more scattered , and in a short time they found themselves at the top of a long , open ground , which sloped to the bay , and was overgrown with moss and low brush wood . At the farther end of the open , a small eminence arose , with some bushes on the summit . Before them the waters of the bay spread out , with the distant horizon skirted by a range of hills . u Here 's the place for rabbits , " said Bart , " if there are any . " " If there are any ! Of course , " said Bruce ; " that 's the point . " They walked on through the brush-wood , and at length , reaching a mossy knoll , they sat down to rest . After a time , Bart started off alone to pursue his investigations . He had not gone far before he stopped , and shrunk back . Then he looked around with a triumphant expression . Then ho moved forward in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " said Bruce . " Bart ' s found something at last , " said Arthur . /z/ " A hare , perhaps/ ' said Tom . The three boys started after Bart . Scarcely had they moved a half dozen paces , when Bart took aim and fired . A loud cry was heard , a largo white bird was seen jumping in the air , and falling to the ground , and then Bart ran forward and secured his prize . The other boys hurried up to him . As they came , he turned to meet them , with a face flushed with triumph , and holding the large white bird by the legs . " What is it ? " they cried . " A wild goose , " said Bart . " A wild goose ! " cried Bruce , who had reached him by that time . " A tame one you mean . " " No it is n't , either . How can it be a tame one ? It 's a wild one . " " No , Bart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tame as I am . " ' You 're a tame goose yourself , " said Bart . " Do you call that a tame goose ? Why , it 's a wild one , of course . Look at its wings . " " What about its wings ? They 're tame enough . No , Bart , it 's the real original domestic goose of the civilized farm-yard . " " Nonsense ! as though I do n't know a tame goose when I see one . " " Well , you see one now . " " No , I do n't . " " This is one . " /z/ " No . " " Yes . " " No . " " It is . " " Pooh ! " " Bart , " said Bruce , " did you ever see a live wild goose ? " " No , I never did . " " Aha ! How do you know anything about them , then ? " " Why , I 've seen pictures , lots of them , and they look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese living and flying , and dead , too , lots of times , and this is n't one . " " 0 , this is a kind that you are not acquainted with . Why , there are ever so many kinds of wild geese . " But at this moment the boys were rudely in terrupted . " Aha ! ye thafes of the wurruld , ye ! " cried a loud voice close beside them . " Ye villains , ye . What are ye dohV , a murdherin ' and slaughterin ' a poor man 's property . Ye blackgyards , ye ! What d'ye mane by comin ' here and shootin ' my geese ? " Thunderstruck at this unexpected interruption , the boys turned , and found themselves face to face with an ' old , grizzled , red-faced little Irishman , whose furious gestures and angry eyes were di rected menacingly toward them . /z/ 130 THE B. o. w. c . " Which af ye 's shot my goose ? " he roared . " I did , " said Bart , quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for it , and dear , too , as sure as me name 's Denny O'Rafferty . What'r ye 's doin ' here , any how ? What d'ye mane by shootin ' my goose ? D'ye think I 'm goin ' to be robbed be a gang of blackpryards ? Be the powers ! if ye think that same , ye 'll find ye 're mistaken , bad scran till ye ! " " Mr. O'Rafferty , " said Bart , " you 're quite mis taken . We 're honest boys , and came here by accident . " " What did ye shoot the goose for , then , ye imp of mischief ? " " It was a mistake , " said Bart , coolly . " Of course I did n't know it was yours , in fact , I was n't aware that anybody was living here . I will be happy to pay you whatever you think it 's worth , and am sorry for the mistake . " At this speech O'Rafferty 's face and manner un derwent a complete change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , " said he , good humoredly , " then we wo n't say any more about it . But how did ye 's get here ? I did n't see any boat . Where did ye land , then ? " " Why , the fact is , we were brought here , " said Bart , who went on to tell him all about their ad venture . Dennis O'Rafferty listened to every word with intense interest , his face undergoing a perpetual O'RAFFERTY is HOSPITABLE. 131 change of expression , that spoke of conflicting emotions . " Be the powers , then 7 he exclaimed , as Bart ceased , " it was a narrow scratch that ye had of it . An ' ye 've been ashore here two nights . Be jabers , it 's meself that 's ashamed of what I said till ye about the goose . Have ye 's had anything till ate thin , at all ? " " Nothing but lobster . " " Lobster ! Well , thin , let me inforrum ye 's that ye 'll find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here all that time wid nothin ' at all to ate . Be jabers , I 'm the boy for ye 's . Come along , boys . Ye 'll find old O'Rafferty can give ye a breakfast , at any rate . Come along . Ye 're starvin ' , so ye are . Me old woman ' 11 be deloighted to set eyes on ye 's . Never mind the goose ; I 'll give ye 's a dozen for nothin ' . Lave it lie there ; the old woman ' 11 come an ' pick it for ye . Come along , boys . " And the old fellow led the way ; while the boys , delighted at the turn which things had taken , fol lowed gayly after . " And so ye'r Docthor Porther 's boys , are ye 's ? " continued Dennis . " Faith it 's himself ' 11 be throubled . It 's a long time I 've knowed the docthor . An ' there is n't his shuparior in the counthry . Arrah , be me sowl , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sight of yer young , fresh faces does good till me old bones . Come along , boys . 132 THE B. 0 . w . C. And is the docthor with ye 's in the schooner ? Come along ; ye have n't fur to go . I 've got a bit of a house around beyant . Ye 'll sec it as soon as iver we turrun the hill . " On rounding the hill , they saw a clearing of about thirty acres , with a boat drawn up on the shore , while close by them was a small house and a barn . An old woman at the door looked up at them in speechless amazement . " It 's the owld woman , " said O'Rafferty . " It 's herself that 's dead bate at the sight of ye 's . " " Lard save us , Dinny , what in the wurruld have ye got there , thin ? " cried the old woman , as the party reached the house . ' It 's some of Docthor Porther 's boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , " said O'Rafferty , " and have n't had a bite to ate for two days , savin ' an ' exceptin ' a bit of cowld lobster , which is n't aisy aitin ' . An ' however they got ashore on there , widout oars , bates me intirely , widout countin ' that thim same has been workin ' like slaves a day or more , on impty stomachs , buildin ' a camp and carry in ' fire-wood , which is hard enough work to kill a man , let alone boys like these . And so stir yer stumps , Molly avick , and bring out praties an ' bacon , the best ye have , and a drawin ' of tay , an ' chayse , an ' bread and butter . It 's starvin ' they all are intoirely , or me name 's not Diuny O'Rafferty. " /z/ " Ah , thin , " cried the old woman , " the saints stand betune us and harrum . What 's that ye'r sayin ' , Dinny O'Rafferty ? Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wurruld ? Sure it 's not much an owld woman like me can do for the likes of ye ; but I 'll give ye the best I 've got , so I will . Sure an ' it 's starvin ' ye must be , if ye 've had nothin ' to ate for so long . " Nothing could exceed the kindness and warmth of welcome which O'Rafferty and his wife gave the boys . The old woman bustled about , and kindled a fire , and put on the pot and kettle , and laid the table , occasionally stopping to look at the boys , one after the other , with a peculiar fondness of expression and a low , crooning noise , such as nurses make over children . " Sure it 's like a breath of fresh air to a captive in a dungeon to look at your swate faces , " she cried . " Niver a boy 's face have I seen since the dark day when my own boy took his swate face from me eyes foriver . An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , an ' lived here ever since . " The old woman gave a long sigh , and sitting down , she held her head in her hands , rocking her self to and fro . " Ah , well , " she said , getting up and going out to the barn , " it 's not much longer to live we have thin . " /z/ " Fifteen years , " said O'Raflferty , as his wife went out . " It 's fifteen years since we lost the boy . " We lived in Parrsboro , an ' had as nice a house and farm as the likes of us could ever wish for . But whin we lost him , we lost all heart for the place . The old woman wud have died if she had staid ; an ' so I bought this bit of a place , an ' what with farmin ' an ' fishin ' we manage to grub along , though it 's seldom or niver that we see anybody but our own two selves . Well , well ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he continued , rising . " It is n't much of a place ; but it 's not long we have to live , and it 'll do for us . " They followed the old man about . The place extended over thirty acres , with a nice beach in front for the boat . It was an easy declivity , with pasture lands behind the house . The boat was a large whaler , and nets Avere spread on the grass to dry . O'Rafferty said that during the summer he had visits sometimes from old friends , and at other times people landed to see about the chances for sporting or getting minerals ; but never , since he had been there , had a boy been on shore , and his wife had not seen a boy since she lost her son . He took them all over the place , and finally led them to a little enclosure not far from the house . Inside was a grave mound , and at the head a white wooden slab , with these words painted upon it : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennis and Mary O'Rafferty , lorn Aug. 2 , 1830 , died June 5 , 1845 . Requiescat in Pace . The old man stood in silence , bareheaded , look ing at the inscription . The boys removed their hats , and looked in solemn sympathy at the be reaved father , whose love and yearning for his lost boy were still so manifest , that the sight of a boy 's face could renew his grief after fifteen vanished years . Standing thus in silence , and reverencing that grief , they waited till the old man turned away , and then followed him , without a word , back across the field , and into the house . As they entered , the savory smell of broiled bacon came gratefully to their nostrils . The table was spread with delicious mealy potatoes , brown crusty bread , butter as yellow as gold , and clean , spotless plates .. If they had the power of wishing and gaining , they would have desired nothing better than this . " Mr. O'Raflerty , " said Bart , suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our number on the each . I will take a run across the island , with your permission , and bring him here , for he is as hungry as we are , if not more so . " /z/ " Another one ! " cried O'Rafferty . " An ' waitin ' on the beach ! Why did n't ye tell me before ? " " Well , you see we were tired with our scramble , and I wanted to get rested before starting back . But I 'll go now , if you 've no objection . " " Deed , thin , an ' I have an objection , " cried O'Rafferty . " D'ye think I 'd let ye go starvin ' back agin before ye 'd got a bite to ate ? or , for that matter , d'ye think I 'd let ye go at all ? No ; I 'll go meself . " " You ? 0 , no . I wo n't allow that , " began Bart . " It 's meself ' 11 go , an ' nobody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too hungry an ' tired . Besides , ye do n't know a step of the way . Ye came through the woods , an ' a mighty tough job ye found it ; but I know an aisier way it 's a path of me own . Ye said it was at the other end of the island , on the other side . " " Yes ; at a rock with a tree on the edge . " " I know the place well . My path comes out close by there . I wonder ye did n't come across it . " " It is a wonder . We certainly would have noticed anything like a path , if we had found one . " " Well , it 's all the same now . Ye 'll jist stay here , an ' sit down an ' ate yer breakfasts like Chris tians , an ' I 'll go an ' bring the boy . Not one of ye shall stir a step not one step . " " Well , Mr. O'Rafferty , I 'm sure you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D'ye call it throuble ? Sure an ' /z/ is n't it the brightest day I 've knowed for iver so long ? " " Deed it is , " chimed in his wife . " Be off wid ye , Dinny dear , and hurry back with the poor boy . Sure I 'll keep the tay hot for him , an ' the praties , an ' the bacon . " Any further remonstrance or objection was out of the question ; so the boys took their seats at the table . The old man started off , and promised to be back in a " jiffy . " He ascended the slope behind the house , and entered the woods by a pathway which , though but Ijttle trodden , was yet easy to traverse . Far different was this from the rough way by which the boys had crossed the island ; and in far less time than they had taken , Denny approached the other shore . The pathway led down to the beach , about a hundred yards below the place where they had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight met his eyes . 138 THE B. o. w. c. /z/ New Attempts at Cookery . Phil on the Loolcout . A Sail ! A Sail ! The Signal of the red Shirt . The Home of the O'ltaffertijs. left Phil behind , on the beach . After the others had departed , Phil oc cupied himself with making arrangements to while away the time . First of all , he set to work to try and make an omelet . After a long search on the beach , he found some clam shells , which he took up to the platform ; and then , se lecting some flat stones , he threw them into the fire . Then he mixed some eggs in - one of the shells , and tried to beat them with his jackknife . His success was not exactly dazzling ; but he was satisfied to a certain extent , and intensely in terested . At length , drawing forth one of the stones , which , by this time , was red hot , he poured the mixture on its surface . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a horrible smell of burnt egg . Phil made an awful face , and giving the stone a kick , sent it flying down to the beach , omelet and all . /z/ Not at all discouraged , he began again ah ovo . Drawing out another stone , he determined to give it time to cool . So he mixed up some more eggs in the shell ; and after waiting patiently for a long time for the stone , he at length thought it was cool enough , and poured the mixture upon it . It certainly had grown cool this time ; in fact , some what too cool , as Phil gradually learned , when , after waiting patiently , he found that there was no ap pearance of any progress whatever in the cookery . So this , too , was a failure , and Phil disdainfully hurled it after its predecessor . But he was not discouraged even yet . Onco more he took his shell and made another mixture , and then drew forth the stone , and carefully watched it , trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , to see if it was of the proper temperature . Having singed the tips of all his fingers , he concluded that it was time to stop that mode of testing , and run the risk of an actual trial . So he once more poured the mixture on the stone . Aha ! this time there was no mistake . A pleasant steam came up , which was grateful to a famished boy . The only trouble was , the lower part was done before the upper was in the least affected ; and worse still , it began to burn while the upper part was raw . Phil was not yet disheartened , however ; and drawing his knife , he made desperate efforts to insert it under the omelet , so as to rn it over . But these efforts were not success- /z/ ful . He only succeeded in intermixing all to gether in a mess , and mangling it into a general mush . In trying to taste some of it , he found in his mouth nothing but a very unpleasant mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quished his experiments , and sent this stone after the others . He now contented himself with roasting two of them ; and having partaken of them , he sauntered up the hill to the signal station . Here he lay down , and looked lazily out at the water . Scarcely had he done so , than he gave a start . An object was before his eyes which he had not been able to see from the platform . The other end of the island could not be seen from there , because a projecting bank shut it out from view ; but from here there was a fair view of the other islands . And there , just coming out from behind Pinnacle Island , was a schooner of the size and rig of the Antelope , and he did not doubt for a moment but that it was their schooner . She was now sailing along , and was not far from that very anchorage where he had seen her last . With a shout and a wild beating of his heart , he sprang to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schooner . She was coming on very well , with a good breeze , and was coming in his direction . Would she con tinue on her course ? If so , she would soon be there . Would she turn aside , and pass through /z/ the channel that separated the islands , or sail away to the main land opposite ? The thought was in tolerable . He had grown weary of desert life ; he longed to leave the island , or , rather , he longed to get something to cat . So he rushed away to the pile of brush , and lighting his matches , a whole card at a time , he touched up the kindling Avood , and in a few mo ments the blaze was spreading through the mass of dry brush . Soon the flames rose high into the air , bearing with them vast volumes of black smoke . Would they see that signal ? They could not help seeing it . Would they understand it ? Ah ! that was another question . Still it came on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either to the right hand or the left . And now it had passed the channel between the islands , and was coming along in a line with the beach below , and not more than half a mile out . The brush fire was burning briskly , and could last for half an hour without replenishing ; but something more was needed . What could he do ? At first he thought of running down to the beach and shouting . But then he feared that he might not be seen on the beach , and that his voice might riot be heard . So that plan was rejected . One only remained , and that was , to climb the signalstaff . In an instant all this had passed through /z/ his mind , and in another instant it was acted upon . He tore off his rod shirt , tied tho sleeves together loosely , and hung it around his neck , and then , with wonderful agility , climbed the tree till he reached the top . The stumps of the branches , which remained on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was able to stand securely , clasping the tree with one arm , while with the other he took his shirt from around his neck , and waved it to and fro in the air . Below , and about thirty feet on one side , the fire blazed ; and there , fifty feet in the air , on that solitary tree , stood the boy , waving , wildly and incessantly , the brilliant scarlet cloth . He felt that he had done the best , and if this would not attract attention , nothing would . All this time the schooner came on , and at length came nearly opposite . Phil saw the crowd on board . He saw them staring and gesticulating . He was recognized he was safe ! Yes , there was Mr. Long , ho knew that tall figure in black , and he was going to the stern . What for ? Aha ! was n't that glorious ? He had gone and had seized the ropes , and lowered and hoisted the flag again a score of times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag ? Why , their own flag , the flag of the " B. 0 . W. C. , " which had evi dently been waving there ever since their depart ure , and now saluted them as it brought them salety. /z/ Phil 's merry laughter rang out loud and clear , as he saw all this , in his excitement and his joy . He saw the schooner head in straight to ward the shore , then sweep round ; and then down rattled her anchor , her sails fell , and she lay waiting . Phil gave a final wave and a loud shout ; and then , descending the tree , he scampered down the slope and along the beach , as fast as his little legs would carry him , until at last he reached the verge of the shore opposite the schooner . Here he gave a loud hurrah . His shrill voice reached the schooner , which was only a short distance off , and was responded to by a loud cheer from all on board . " Where are the other boys ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll be here soon . " " Where 's the boat ? " " Up there , " said Phil , pointing to where it lay . " We ca n't get ashore . We 've got no boat . " " When the tide gets up , and the boys come back , we can get the boat out , " said Phil . " How are you all ? " cried Mr. Long . " Very well , but nearly starved . " Instantly Mr. Long disappeared into the cabin . Returning shortly , he had a bundle in his hand , around which a string was tied . Then taking one end of the string , and whirling it violently around , sling fashion , he- hurled it through the air toward the shore . The parcel fell about twenty feet /z/ beyond Phil . He ran to it , and , on opening it , found a quantity of sandwiches . The ravenous way in which he devoured the sandwiches showed to those on board , far more powerfully than words , how famished poor Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back soon ? " asked Mr. Long . " 0 , yes . They 've gone across the island to ex plore . " " Were you able to sleep ? " " Sleep ? 0 , yes , first rate . " " How ? " " In the camp up there , " said Phil , with his mouth full of sandwich , waving his hand in the direction of the platform . " We 'd have en joyed it if we 'd only had some sandwiches , " he added after a time , as he made a fresh onslaught on the parcel . It was now about eleven o'clock , and not quite half tide . The tide was rising , however , and in due time would be up to the boat ; . and then , if the boys did not come , they might get in near enough to throw Phil a line , and from the schooner pul 1 the boat into the water . For the present it wu necessary to wait ; so Phil ate his sandwiches , and talked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the eyes of Dennis O'Rafferty as he descended to the beach . Dennis soon understood it all . He saw that the /z/ schooner had been searching for the boys , and had come here in their absence , and had found this boy . He hurried , without delay , to the beach , and at once told Phil where his riends were , and explained to those on board the schooner what they were doing , and why he had come . " An ' is the docthor on board ? " " No ; he did n't come . " " Ah , thin it 's mesilf that 's sorry for that same , " said Dennis . On understanding the difficulty about the boat , he at once set himself to work remedying it . He found the rollers which the boys had used , and the poles ; and then , with Phil 's assistance , he began to push her down toward the water . It was far easier pushing her down than it had been pulling her up , and the boat soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oar , and we were making another . I do n't know whether you can use it or not , " said Phil . " Wait here , and I 'll go and get it . " On bringing it , Dennis found it quite rough , of course , but still capable of working the boat along . So he launched the boat , and Phil jumped in , and Dennis followed ; and in a short time the boat touched the vessel 's side . The current just here was not strong , for it was half tide , and the vessel was very close to the shore . Phil was dragged on board by a dozen hands , and nearly suffocated by their rapturous greetings . /z/ Mr. O'RafTcrty then explained again where the other boys were , and invited all on board to conic to his house and meet them . His invitation was eagerly complied with . Another oar was found on board , and soon Messrs . Simmons and Long , with all the boys , were on the beach . Then they started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told them all about their experience in shell-fish and lobsters . Then they followed O'RafFerty across the island to his house . On the way , Mr. Long told Phil all about the dismal voyage of the schooner after them . After cruising all about the Basin of Minas on the pre vious day , they had decided to come back to the Five Islands , and search along the shores , with tho hope of finding them , or at least some traces of them . They had been watching the shore of this island so closely , that they had seen the first flash of the fire on the signal station . When they saw the red shirt by it , and then the figure climbing the tree , they knew that their search was at last successful . He made Phil tell him , over and over again , all about his ow T n-eventful escape , and shuddered to think how extreme their peril had been . The walk over O'Rafferty 's path was a most delightful one to all . The fearful cloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last dispelled , and in their reaction from sorrow , they all felt the /z/ wildest extreme of joy . So the boys went on with shouts , and songs , and laughter , till they reached their destination . There the others had finished their repast , and were waiting for Phil . Great was their amazement to see the crowd . At once all was explained . With a wild cry of delight , they rushed to meet their friends , and their hands were nearly shaken off by their excited comrades . Mr. O'Rafferty then left them , and Mrs. O'Rafferty prepared a repast for the company . But first she set before Phil the good things that she had been saving for him ; and , though that young gentleman had disposed of an immense quantity of sandwiches , he yet was able thanks to his excellent appetite and vigorous constitution to do full justice to Mrs. O'Kafferty 's tea and cream , and brown crusty bread and golden butter , and rich bacon , and mealy potatoes . Then the table was once more spread for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeable change from the ship stores on which they had been feeding . To tell ' the truth , there were many among the company who were as famished , and had eaten quite as little , during the last twenty or thirty hours , as the castaways them selves . They then strolled about the fields and along the bead , till suddenly a shout from one of the boys attracted the attention of all . There , coming round the point , was the familiar /z/ form of the Antelope , her boat towed behind her once more ; Captain Corbet , the mate , and O'Rafferty on board , and the black flag of the " B. 0 . W. C. " floating gloriously aloft . " It 's been there all the time , " said Billymack . " Was n't it odd ? Mr. Long would n't let any one pull it down . " " And all the schooners laughed at us , " said Bogud . " It was such nonsense . " " Nonsense ? " said Bart . " Far from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as it floats on the breeze , we 'll turn out all right . " " If you call this good luck , I should like to know what bad luck is . " Here the anchor rattled , and all the boys ran to the beach . When the time came for them to leave , O'Rafferty was in despair . He wanted them to stay at least one night . But Mr. Long could not . They had already lost much time , and must make amends for it . They had to go that evening to Pratt 's Cove . So O'Rafferty consoled himself by extort ing a promise that the next time they came to the Five Islands they would anchor off his beach , and stop at least two days with him . Meanwhile the boys had a long debate as to what they could give to O'llafferty . To offer money would be an insult . They had to select from among their possessions something that would be appropriate for a parting gift . Bart proposed /z/ his pistol , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Rafferty . At last it was decided to give him the hatchet . A hatchet would always be useful ; and it was so pretty a little tool , that it would be in itself a graceful keepsake . So Bart , with his jackknife , cut into the handle , very neatly , the initials of the different members of the " B. 0 . W. C. , " and handed the gift to the old man . " You wo n't refuse it , " said Bart , " will you , Mr. O'Rafferty ? " And he explained the initial letters to him . Tears started to the old man 's eyes . " It 's fairly heart-broken I am to part wid ye ; but I 'll take the hatchet to remember yer sweet faces by , and wid the hope that you wo n't forget owld O'Rafferty . And many 's the drame I 'll be dramin ' about yes , till me owld eyes gets a look at yes again . " . " An ' may the blessin 's av Heaven go wid yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ejaculated the old woman . " It 's meself that 'll pray for yes , that the Lard ' 11 stan ' betune yes and harrum . I 'll be lookin ' out for yes all another year , jewels ; an ' I 'll have such crame , chayse , an ' such maily taters , as e never saw the like of before . " The old couple wrung the hands of all of them , and watched them embark . Soon all were on board . Then the anchor went up , and up went the sails . The schooner started , and moved slowly away . /z/ And as she moved away , the boys saw the old couple standing on the beach waving farewells . There they stood till the vessel rounded a prom ontory which shut them from sight . They were on their way to Pratt 's Cove . /z/ PratPs Cove . A Dinner Party . The faithless Cook and Steward . Songs . Sudden and startling Interruption . Stealing a Wood-pile . Overwhelming Piece of Intelligence . wind and tide were both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Pratt 's Cove . This place is formed by the bed of a creek which runs up from the bay , and , like all the streams of these waters , is subject to very great variations , being fordable at low tide , but at high tide deep enough to float a ship . It was half tide when they arrived , and the schooner was able to run a little way up the stream , where she anchored . It was quite dark , but they could see that the nearest land was a projecting point , clear of trees , and promising a pleasanter campingground than the hold of the schooner . It was therefore unanimously decided to go ashore , kindle a fire , and pass as festive an evening as possible . The shore was close by , and in a very short time they were all out of the vessel . Plenty of fuel lay there in the shape of a long pile of dry birch /z/ wood which lay heaped up along the shore . To this they helped themselves , kindled an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for their evening repast . At the outset of the trip , Johnny Blue and Sam my Ram Ram had been appointed steward and cook , owing to their personal application for those very honorable offices . Their duties had been very light ; in fact , partly on account of rough weather , and partly owing to the anxiety of the previous day , there had been little or no occasion for their services . It was therefore expected that on the present occasion they would surpass themselves and astonish everybody by the brilliancy of their performance . As the party sat round the fire waiting for their repast , they all anticipated some thing of extraordinary excellence , and were impa tient for the banquet to begin . Sammy and Johnny Blue , however , made no very great haste . In fact , it seemed to some that they were astonishingly slow , if not reluctant . Slowly they turned over the things , slowly they opened and shut the boxes and baskets , and very slowly indeed they took out the dishes . " See here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't appear to be aware of the fact that we 're all starving . " " Hurry up your cakes ! " cried another . " Come , be quick about it , Sammy Ram Ram ! What 's the use of being so particular ? " /z/ " Tumble out the things any way ! We do n't want a regular set table . " Sammy and Johnny quickened their motions a little , and said they would be ready " in a minute . " Meanwhile Messrs . Simmons and Long , assisted by the devoted Bogud , had been sorting their min erals in a general way , and wrapping each specimen in paper . Two good-sized baskets were filled , and many of them were very fine indeed . There were some fern prints , and some tracks of birds on sand stone , which Mr. Long had found , and which he regarded with the tenderest admiration . There was a very excellent amethyst , found by Mr. Sim mons , some mica , some barytes , and , above all , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were visible . It was taken from a vein which ran up the cliff , and was a foot or more in thickness . It seemed to promise a rich gold harvest to any one who might choose to try gold-crushing in so remote a place . The tender interest excited by all these treas ures , and the occupation of putting them into sep arate baskets , had so fully engrossed their thoughts , that they had not noticed any particular delay . At last , however , the work was done ; and then it was that Mr. Long thought about the claims of ap petite . He started to his feet . " What ! " he cried , as he looked around ; " not ready yet ? Why , what 's the matter ? " /z/ " In a minute , " said Sammy Ram Ram . " Yes , yes in a minute , " chimed in Johnny Blue . " A minute ? Well , that 's longer than I can wait . So come along , all of us ! " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been spread . The rest all followed . There was a very meagre repast in fact , but tho beginning of a repast before them . " Come , hurry up ! " said Mr. Long , as he and Mr. Simmons , followed by the rest , threw them selves on the grass around the table-cloth . " Fetch along some of the turkey and chickens quick ! " There was no response . Sammy and Johnny both stood looking excessively guilty . " Come , hurry up ! We ca n't eat ham and bis cuit . Why , what 's the matter ? " " Why there there is n't any , " stammered Sammy . ' ' What 's that ? " cried Mr. Long . " The turkey it 's all gone , sir . " " Gone ! " cried Mr. Long , in amazement . " What do you mean ? " And twelve astonished faces confronted the cook and steward . " Why , sir , " said the cook , " you see we ate a good many before we started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turkeys eaten that evening and next morning . " " And fifteen chickens , sir . " /z/ " And ten mince pies/ ' added the steward , gath ering courage at the sound of his own voice . " And all the cheese , " responded the cook . " And most of the tarts . " " And a good deal of the cake . " " And a good many of the ham sandwiches , and half of the eggs , and " " And ever so much ginger beer . " " The boys were , eating , sir , steadily through the night , " " And through the next day , till they got sick , and could n't eat any more . " To this all present listened in the utmost aston ishment , and without saying a single word . " So we ate most of the things before we left did we ? " asked Mr. Long , with a sour smile . " Yes , sir . " " How many turkeys did we leave with ? " " Seven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Four , sir . " " And how many mince pies ? " " Eight , sir . " " Have we eaten all these since ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , " said Jiggins , " all day yesterday I only ate one ham sandwich , and to-day only a turkey drumstick , except at O'Rafferty 's . " " I ate a mince pie yesterday , " said Billymack " and another one to-day that 's all . " /z/ " Well , well , I 'm not inquiring into what you ate , boys , " said Mr. Long , good-lmmoredly . " I was only amazed to find that our stores had gone so fast . We 'll have to live on clams , or go home , unless we can buy some provisions here . Well , well , " he con cluded , with a sigh , " we 'll have to attack this ham bone . Here , cook ; is n't there any more ham left ? " " One more , sir . " " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . " " Hm well we 'll have to wait till to-morrow that 's all . It 's my own fault , I suppose . I did n't make allowance for the appetites of grow ing boys . " " Especially of the cook and steward , " growled Bogud . They had to bear with their disappointment as best they could . The cook and steward looked very meek and subdued , for though nothing was said , yet they felt that they were under a ban . The repast consisted of nothing but bread and butter , and ham , and cold water . But still , as they all had excellent appetites , they ate with a relish what was before them , and had no trouble , except about provisioning the ship for the future . It was tacitly understood , however , that Sammy Ram Ram and Johnny Blue should be henceforth relieved from these onerous and responsible duties . The repast was at length finished , and Messrs . Simmons and Long went aside to take another look /z/ at their beloved specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Five Islands . The others sat round the fire . Captain Corbet sat , with a patriarchal smile , surveying the young faces around him . The mate sat among a crowd of noisy lads , who were trying to draw him out . " Yes , " he said , in continuation of some statement which he was making , " it 's true . I 'm tellin ' - " And that 's your name is it ? " asked Billymack . " My name 's Wade , " said the mate , " an ' my old ' oman 's name 's Gipson ; and ye 'll not find many of that name in this counthry . No , sir . " " But how can your name be Wade , and your old ' oman 's name be Gipson ? " " How ? because my name is Wade , and me old ' oman 's name is Gipson . " " But she 's your wife ai n't she ? " " My own wife married be me brother the praste . " " Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name 's Gipson . " " If she 's your wife , she must be named Wade . " " I tell ye me name 's Wade , and me old ' oman 's name 's Gipson ; an ' ye 'll not find many o ' that name in this counthry . " , And so the mate prosed on , unable to see that his wife 's name was the same as his own . And now fresh wood was heaped upon the fire . Some went off and gathered brush , and the bright , /z/ flaring flame burst forth , rising far into the sky , and throwing a vivid light . Then they all sat rounJ it , watching the flames as they shot up and illuminated the scene , throwing a gleam of radiance across the water , and lighting up the old schooner as she lay afloat . Then a song was proposed . Captain Corbet opened the proceedings by one of his own peculiar harmonies , which was received with loud laughter and cheers . Others then sang ; and finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song with all . So Bart sang Bingo , and they all joined in the chorus . " A farmer 's dog sat on the floor , And his name was little Bingo ; A farmer 's dog sat on the floor , And his name was little Bingo . Bart . B ! Bruce . I ! ! Arthur . N ! 1 1 Tom . G ! ! ! ! Omnes . O ! O ! 0 ! O ! 0 ! And his name was little Bingo !

We think it is , by jingo ! " As the last chorus , roared out in tremendous tones , burst into the air and ceased , ' it was fol lowed by a sudden roar of thundering laughter coming from some strange voice from the direction of the wood-pile . In an instant every one had started to his feet , and looked in amazement for the cause of the noise . There , on the top of the wood-pile , stood a stout , burly , red-faced man , laughing , and stamping , and clapping his hands . It was a long time before he could gain breath , to speak . At length he con quered his laughter , and shaking his fist , he bawled out , " See here , you young rascals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up my wood ? Hey ! " At this Mr. Long came forward , and Captain Corbet followed . Mr. Long introduced himself , explained the situation , apologized , and offered to pay . This the stranger laughingly listened to . /z/ " Pooh , pooh ! Mr. Long . I 'm delighted to see you , sir , " he said . " Do n't apologize for the wood . You 're welcome to all of it . I 'm Captain Pratt , and I want you to come up to my house , and put up there as long as you like . As for the wood , I 'll give you free liberty to burn it , on condition that the boys sing that song again . " Captain Pratt now advanced among them , and his bluff manner , hearty laughter , and stentorian voice at once made him a great favorite . He in formed them that he was the owner of the cove and all the region round about ; that he had a saw mill up the stream ; that he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all should go at once to his house , and take up their quarters there for as long a time as they liked . This invitation was unanimously accepted , with thanks from the teachers and cheers from the boys . So , leaving Captain Corbet and the mate to extin guish the fire , to prevent danger to the wood-pile , they followed Captain Pratt through the darkness to his house . It was a small-sized farm-house , where Captain Pratt and his wife lived by themselves . He three beds , into one of which he proposed to pi Messrs . Simmons and Long , leaving the otht beds and a huge kitchen sofa for the twelve boyg Captain Corbet and the mate could sleep on tl vessel . The boys succeeded in packing themselvc away in some extraordinary fashion or other ; anc /z/ though they Avould have had far more real comfort on board of the schooner , yet they preferred this for the novelty of the thing . On the following day , the first care was to secure a supply of provisions . Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he kept supplies for the mill , but unfortunately the stock was low ; but the schooner was expected every day with fresh stores . All that the shop contained at present , was some meal and molasses , with a box of to bacco and a barrel of pork . Out of these they had to select the ship stores ; and as they had only Hobson 's choice , they laid in some meal , molasses , and pork . Captain Corbet tried hard to induce them to lay in some tobacco also , but Mr. Long declined . Strolling about the cove , they found it a very pretty place , encircled by hills which were covered with hard-wood trees . A stream ran from among the hills into the creek , supplying it with a little fresli water , which at low tide was the only water in its bed . Going up the stream a short distance , they came to a very romantic spot , where the stream ran through a narrow gorge , and tumbled over a small precipice , forming a miniature cascade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greater part of the day in fishing , and succeeded , after six hours ' laborious effort and patient waiting on the part cf ten of them , in catching five very small trout . /z/ After getting the supplies for the schooner , Messrs . Simmons and Long went along the shore to a place which Captain Corbet told them of , where they expected to secure some petrifactions . Cap tain Corbet went with them as guide . The mate took possession of the barn , and slept all the time . As for the boys , two of them , Bogud and Billymack , went with the teachers by special invitation , for the others preferred remaining . Six hours were consumed in fishing , and the remainder of the time in dawdling . They did Pratt 's Cove so thoroughly that there was not a nook unexplored . On the following night , the " B. 0 . W. C. " de cided to quit Captain Pratt 's house and sleep in the schooner . So they went down about dusk , and were put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shore . Messrs . Simmons and Long did not return that night , nor yet on the following morning . About ten o'clock they got back . They were met by Captain Pratt and the five boys who had slept at his house . They had very serious faces . It seems that Captain Pratt had been down at eight o'clock to call the boys to breakfast . lie found the schooner gone , and on the mud flats , left dry by the tide , lay the fluke of the anchor broken off short . This was the message that he brought , explaining , at the same time , that the boys had slept on board , and must have drifted away with the schooner. /z/ On the Track again . Fishing for a Duck . AsJcing for Bread , and getting Stones . Pat shines as CooJc. fT receiving such startling intelligence , both Messrs . Simmons and Long looked horrified and bewildered , and neither of them said one word . " At any rate , the mate 's on board , " said Mr. Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst of it . He got his breakfast only a half an hour go . He slept in my barn . " " And where has the vessel gone ? " cried Mr. Long , in great distress . " I ca n't tell . I rowed out for a mile , but did n't see any signs of her . " " We must go after them at once , " said Mr. Long . " Ca n't we get a sail-boat somewhere ? " " I suppose I can rig up a sail in my boat ; but she 's only a punt , and I do n't think we could man age her at all among the currents out there . " " I wonder if they know anything about sailing ? " /z/ " No doubt they do , " said Captain Pratt . " 0 , they 're all right , " said Captain Corbet , con fidently . " I said , when they went adrift before , that they 'd turn up right side up and up they turned . Besides , the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Still we must do something , " said Mr. Long , anxiously . " Even if they do understand sailing , they can never get back here again . " " It 's jest what I 've been expectin ' , " said Cap tain Corbet , after a profound silence , and with a tone of deep conviction . " What ? " " Why , that there anchor . " " What did you expect ? " " Why , that it would break off short . You see there 's been a crack in it for nigh two years , an ' every time I used it , I said , says I , it 's bound to go this time . " " But why in Heaven 's name did you let it go so long , if it was cracked ? " " Wai , to tell the truth , I never gave it a thought , ' cept when I had occasion to anchor , and then , of course , I could n't get it mended . " " And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives of other people , to that old , cracked anchor , " cried Mr. Long , indignantly . " Wai , it held on well down thar at Five Islands , and off on the mud-flats . You know that . It did jest as well as a bran new one , and did n't break fair this time , nuther. " /z/ " Did n't break fair ! What do you mean ? " " Why , I mean the schooner has kind o ' sot on it when she was aground , and broke it that way . " Mr. Long turned away . " Captain Pratt , " said he , " I wo n't conceal from you that I 'm very anxious . Those boys may un derstand sailing , but I 'm not sure that they do . I must do something . Ca n't you suggest anything ? " " Well , I was just going to take my glass , " said Captain Pratt , " and go down to that there pint , " pointing to a headland a few miles off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole bay , and I should n't wonder if we 'd see the schooner . I was just going there when you came . Besides , we can get a boat down there , a good deal better than mine . " " We 'll start off at once , then , " said Mr. Long . " These boys can wait here till We come back . I hope we wo n't need to trouble your good nature long , Captain Pratt . " " Trouble ! Why , sir , it 's the greatest pleasure I have to see a strange face here occasionally . " After a few words of warning and good advice to the boys who were to remain , Mr. Long , together with Mr. Simmons , went with Captain Pratt , while Captain Corbet , with Bogud and Billymack , fol lowed after them . The party of six set out in the direction of the headland mentioned by Captain Pratt , while the five boys who remained sauntered /z/ down slowly to the shore , where were the boxes and baskets which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cove . The boys felt the hours hang heavily upon their hands . The absence of their companions made them all feel dull ; the fare at Captain Pratt 's had grown distasteful , for pork and Indian meal and molasses are things that are sometimes not won derfully attractive to the youthful taste . So these things palled ; and when , at twelve o'clock , they were summoned to dinner by amiable Mrs. Pratt , she found that they had lost their appetites a thing which she attributed to their grief about their lost companions ; and so she set to work to condole with them and comfort them . After escaping from this kind-hearted old lady , they went down to the point again , and watched the water as it flowed in . Captain Pratt and his companions had not come , back , and they were prepared for a long absence on his part . The thought made them more dis consolate . " What can we do ? " said Sammy . " " We 'll starve , " said Johnny Blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiggins , who . was a very grave , earnest boy , and always spoke in a very grave , earnest manner . " Well , what ? " " For my part , " said Jiggins , " I 'll go fishing . Who 'll come with me ? " " I will , " said Muckle. /z/ " And I , " said Johnny Blue . " I do n't think there 's any chance , " said Pat ; " so I 'll stay here and fish for ails in the mud . " Pat could never get rid of " a taste of the brogue , " which clung to him , and proclaimed his nationality . Sammy* showed no inclination to move ; so the three went fishing , leaving him and Pat behind . Pat then went into the woods and cut a long fishing-pole , after which he went fishing for " ails . " He had no success , but kept at it bravely for more than an hour , unwilling to give up . At last his patience was worn out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Sammy was not to be seen . Pat seated himself disconsolately on the shore , and watched the tide , which was now running out , for some time . Then his roving eyes were at tracted by the baskets and trunks . To these he directed his stqps , in the hope that something might be found there with which he could satisfy the cravings of his appetite . He found most of the trunks empty . Some of the baskets were filled with plates , others with cups and saucers , others with knives , forks , and spoons . All these excited his disgust to an un measured degree . In one of them he found a hambone , the remainder of their last repast on the shore . This had nothing on it whatever a fact which excited such indignation in Pat that he flung it into the water . /z/ At last he came to the baskets containing the minerals . Opening these , he found a large number of parcels inside . Hoping that these would afford something eatable , he opened one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspeakable disgust , that they contained nothing but stones . Pat was a very original character , who had drifted , by some extraordinary chance , into the school . With a very strong desire to get an " edication , " he had come there and begged Dr. Porter to admit him , offering to pay his way by working . Dr. Porter found that the Irish boy had already learned a good deal , and that he had an ex ceedingly strong desire to be taught more . He could read and write well ; and so earnest were his entreaties , that the kind-hearted doctor consented to admit him . His industry and application soon gained the good will of the teachers ; while his flow of good spirits , his oddities and whims , made him popular among the boys . In many respects he was intensely ignorant , and had not been long enough at the school to acquire anything like the general information which the rest of the boys possessed . At first they had wondered or laughed at his blunders ; but afterward Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus , by exhibiting his ignorance . less , was supposed to have surmounted it . Taking him all together , he was a very remarkable boy , and prom ised , in time , to surpass many of his companions . /z/ At present , however , he was far inferior to them all . He had been asked to go on the trip of the Antelope from a very kindly desire to give him all the advantages possible . He had not the remotest idea what the real purpose of the trip was , but supposed it to be a kind of pleasure party . It is true he saw Messrs . Simmons and Long hammering rocks ; but with his usual caution about committing himself and exposing his ignorance , he had not asked anything about it , nor had he looked at their work . While they were hammering rocks , he was climbing them , or running about the beach . He had not noticed the baskets , but supposed them to be full of provisions ; nor had he seen Messrs . Simmons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landing on this place . The stones , then , which Pat discovered , wrapped in paper , were utterly unintelligible to him , and the sight of them only seemed to cap the climax of the indig nation which was growing in his breast . " Well ! well ! well ! " he exclaimed , as he looked at each stone on taking it from the paper . " What 's this ? A stone a muddy stone ! By the powers , but is n't this like a boy askin ' for bread , and gettin ' a stone . " In fact it was no better than a dirty stone in Pat 's eyes . Two very beautiful specimens of moss agate they were ; but it would need grinding and polishing to bring out these peculiar beauties . As yet they were concealed . /z/ Another and another paper was opened . One contained a white stone , like quartz , enclosing some amethysts ; another a piece of sandstone , with peculiar marks on it , very highly prized by Mr. Simmons . These Pat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took the rest/ out Avithout opening them , knowing by the touch and the weight of them what they were . He had a strong hope that something eatable might yet be in the bottom of the basket ; but at last all was empty , and there was nothing to eat . His indignation could no longer be repressed . He had a vague idea that some one had done this so as to play a trick on him , and this thought only heightened his passion . So , without thinking of anything but his own wrongs , he seized the un offending stones by handfuls , and angrily threw them over the bank into the water . Then he sat down gloomily , and tried to conjecture which of the boys it had been who had wrapped all those stones in paper for the sake of tricking him . At first his impulse was to go around among them fiercely and inquire ; but at length , from fear of being laughed at , he decided to say nothing about it , but wait and see what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a touch on the shoulder . He started hastily , and saw Johnny Blue , look ing very mysterious , with something under his jacket . /z/ " Hallo ! Where are the others ? " said Pat . " Could n't you catch anything ? " " The others are up the brook , fishing . I caught something , " said Johnny , with a more mysterious look than ever . " What is it ? What have you got under your arm ? " " See , " said Johnny , triumphantly ; and lifting his jacket , he displayed , to Pat 's astonished gaze , the form of a duck . " A duck ! " cried Pat , with a shout . " Where did you get it ? " " H-s-s-s-s-h ! " said Johnny , warningly . " I caught it . " " Caught it ? " " Yes , with a fish-hook . I trailed the hook , baited with a bit of bread , and the duck bit and here he is . " " We 'll cook him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd better get away where they wo n't see us . " " Sure nobody ' 11 see us here , at all , at all . " " Wo n't they ? " " Surely no . There 's lots of wood here , an ' I 'll start the fire in a jiffy . Come along . Hurroo , boys ! " So Pat and Johnny set the fire going , and then they picked the duck , which was previously killed , of course , and they had him all ready to lay on the coals , when suddenly their attention was /z/ arrested by a low , muffled , piteous squeak close by them behind the wood-pile . " H-s-s-s-s-h ! " said Johnnie . " Botheration ! " said Pat , hiding the duck under a log of wood . " What is it ? " said Johnnie . " Sure it 's a pig that 's what it is , " said Pat . A rustle was heard now in the bushes , and then Sammy walked out from behind the wood-pile . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , had something under his arm . " It 's another duck ! " said Pat , with a wild laugh . " Sammy 's been out fishin ' , too , " and he went off into a peal of laughter . " Stop your noise , " said Sammy . " I thought you were somebody else , and that 's why I had to come through the trees , and behind the wood-pile . " " Is it a duck ye 've got , thin ? " asked Pat . " Sure , have n't we one oursilves ? " Sammy said nothing , but drawing his jacket aside , showed the little white head and twinkling eyes of a pig of very small size a roaster , in fact , in excellent condition . " It 's a pig ye 've got . Did n't I know the squale of it ? Did n't I say it was ? It 's me that knows the voice of a pig . Hurroo , boys ! we 're goin ' to have a banquet , so we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy , jewel ? " " Do n't talk so loud , " said Sammy , looking cau tiously all around . " They 'll hear you . " /z/ " It 's mum I 'll be , thin . But where did ye get it , darlin ' ? " said Pat , in a soft , coaxing whisper . " Up there . " " Where ? Pratt 's ? " " No . " " Where thin ? " " 0 , never mind . It was n't near any house . It was in a field . There were a dozen of them ; and I was so hungry I could n't help it . " " Faith , thin we may as well have the young roaster as the old pork , " said Pat . " Ye 're well here . We 're in luck this day . See here . " And he pulled out the duck and showed it to Sammy . " How nicely you 've picked it and fixed it ! " said he . " I wish we could manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . " " Many 's the pig I 've kilt , " said Pat , loftily . " Have you then ? And will you do this one ? " " Will I do it ? Faith , it 's me that will , " said Pat . " But wo n't he squeal ? " " Squale is it ? Not a squale you 'll hear . " On this Sammy handed the pig to Pat , who dis appeared with it among the bushes . No sound was heard ; but after a short absence Pat returned in triumph , having accomplished his object . " And now we 'll have two roasts , instead of one . " Driving two forked sticks into the ground , he made another with a sharp point , and ran it through the duck and the pig ; then he laid the stick with /z/ its burden upon the two forked sticks , and knelt down by the fire . " The coals are just right , " said Pat . " I 'll sit here an ' give it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye 'll relave me . " So he kept on turning the spit , and soon a rich aromatic fragrance filled the air . " Is n't there any salt ? " asked Pat , after a time . " Of course , " said Johnny ; " and there 's pepper too . I 'll get the castors . " " Do , thin , and quick too , " said Pat . The castors were soon forthcoming , and Pat sprinkled a little salt and pepper over the roaster and the duck . " That 's the way , " said he , " to bring out the full fleevour . " At length they were done , and taken off the fire . The plates , knives and forks , upon which Pat had looked so contemptuously shortly before , were now brought forth . A pleasant place was found in a secluded spot , and here they sat down to dine . They had scarcely begun when footsteps were heard . Pat went out to reconnoitre . It was Jiggins and Muckle . " Have ye caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " No , " said they in a discontented tone ; " and we 're starving . " " Is it starvin ' ye are ? Thin will ye just step in here , for we 've got the most illegant dinner ye ever sot eyes on . " And saying this he led them /z/ to the little secluded no.ok , where the table was spread on the grass . At six o'clock they went up to tea , and Mrs. Pratt sympathized deeply with the poor boys , who had lost their appetites from anxiety . /z/ Adrift . Skilful Navigators . Breakers ahead . A narrow Scratch . Stuck in the Mud . ET us now return to the unfortunate " B. 0 . W. C. " who had met so unexpectedly with another adventure . On going on board of the schooner , they found the water low ; and the tide had just begun to float her in rising . As they had slept but little the preceding night , they retired almost immediately , and soon were buried in a profound slumber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on deck , and the next instant gave a loud cry . " Hallo , boys ! " he cried . Get up ! We 're adrift . Hurry up quick ! " Awaking instantly at this startling news , they tumbled up on deck without a moment 's delay ; and there , true enough , they found themselves far out in the bay , adrift , apparently , as Phil had said . " This is queer , " said Bruce . " Here 's her an chor down , as usual . " The others walked to the bows where Bruce /z/ ras , and saw the chain hanging down , just as longh she were anchored . " We are anchored , sure enough , " said Arthur . " No , we 're not ; we 're drifting , " said Bart . " Look at the land . " A look at the land satisfied all that the vessel was actually moving through the water . " Let 's try the anchor . It must be dragging , " said Bart . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of time found the anchor raised . As they worked , they found it lighter than they expected ; and when at length they had ended , they ran to the bows . All was explained . The anchor was broken off short at the fluke . " That 's how it happened , " said Bart . " And so we 're in for another adventure . " " What shall we do now ? " " Sail the vessel , of course , " said Bruce . " Where to ? " " Back to Pratt 's Cove . " " And where is that ? " No one could answer that . Each one looked around carefully , in order to see if he could find any place which looked like Pratt 's Cove . But there were two difficulties in the way of any such discovery . In the first place , they had approached Pratt 's Cove in the dark , and did not know how it looked ; and in the second place , they could not see any spot that looked like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bay . Before them was the Parrsboro ' shore . Behind them was Blomidon . On one side , and a little in front , were the Five Islands , about six miles distant ; beyond which the waters of the bay extended , till they faded away into a low , indistinct line of coast . They could understand , in a general way , that Pratt 's Cove lay somewhere in front of them , but they could not guess within twenty miles of the place . " Let 's up sail , " said Tom , " and run up there . It looks like a cove ; " and he pointed to a hollow in the line of hills . " 0 , the hills around Pratt 's Cove are higher than that , " said Bruce . " Suppose we sail over and ask O'Rafferty . " " Very well . I agree to that , " said Bart . " Bruce , you can steer . " " No . You may as well steer , " said Bruce . " I do n't particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't any of you fellows want to ? " " 0 , no . We do n't care . You steer , Bart . We 'll hoist the sails . " So Bart turned away with rather a blank expres sion on his face , and walked slowly to the rudder . The wind was moderate , and the water only a little ruffled . The other boys , with immense confusion and shouting , toiled away at the sails one after the other , and at last - managed to get them set . " Perhaps we 'd better not have the foresail up , " suggested Bart . /z/ " 0 , yes . Why not ? " said Bruce . " Come , ys up she rises ! " And shouting out a sailor 's song which he had ) nce heard , he completed his work . The vessel moved gently through the water , and Bart pointed her head towards the island which he considered to be O'Bafferty 's . The wind was fair , and the vessel came around very easily , and then headed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Bart belonged to a seaport town , and as his father was a merchant , and as Bart himself had once experienced a sea fever , and had been almost on the point of running away to sea , he had , very naturally , been always regarded among his companions as a great au thority on all matters connected with seamanship . And so , to a certain extent , he was . He knew all about the rigging of a ship , and understood , in a general way , the principles on which she sailed . He was also a good oarsman ; but in point of fact , he had never handled a sail-boat in his life . This was owing to his father 's prudence , who allowed him to go out rowing whenever he pleased , but never permitted him to have a sail-boat . And so it happened that Bart knew no more about sailing than any one on board . However , there was no help for it ; and he had to take the tiller and assume the responsibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fidence . The wind was moderate , the /z/ was going in a straight course , and O'Rafferty 's Island was full before him . They went on for a long time , when at length Bruce exclaimed , " Well , I do n't see how it is . We 've been going to O'Rafferty 's for full half an hour , and we are no nearer . And here we are , with Pinnacle Island coming between us . " " It 's the currents , " said Bart , coolly . " Nobody can sail in this bay , unless he understands all about them . I 'm sure I do n't . " " Had n't wo better bring her about , and stand off on the other tack ? We could then steer so as to make allowance for the current , which seems to be setting off there . " " Here , Bruce , you steer , " said Bart . " I 'm tired . " " 0 , well , let 's bring her around first . Port your helm , Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned the helm in exactly the opposite way , some confusion was the result . " Port 1 I said port ! " cried Bruce . " ! " said Bart ; and seeing that he had made a mistake , he proceeded to rectify it by turning it starboard . The vessel had turned partly ; but as Bruce had expected it to turn in the opposite direction , he had checked Bart 's mistake . But Bruce himself knew as little about sailing as Bart , and so he had swung the sails the wrong way . /z/ The vessel caught the wind as she came round ; and Bart , who had tried to obey Bruce 's correction , finding that the vessel was all right , and was doingvery well , checked himself , and let her go . Bart now saw that Bruce had made a mistake , and Bruce suspected that Bart had . But they said nothing , and the other boys thought that both Bruce and Bart were first-rate navigators . The schooner now held on straight ahead on what Bart supposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well satisfied with the proceedings . " I think we 'd better come round again , Bart , " said Bruce . " Very well , " said Bart , who had been looking forward to this . " Port your helm , then , " said Bruce . Bart turned the helm a-starboard , as he had done before , while Bruce and Arthur swung the booms to assist the vessel . She came round that time all right . " Why , Bart ! why did n't you port the helm ? " " Because I had to put the helm starboard to bring her round . It 's all right . " Bruce looked grave . He felt that he had com mitted a blunder . After all , which was port and which was starboard he hardly knew . He con cluded after this to intrust the care of the vessel to one who knew , like Bart , and felt quite grateful to Bart for his delicacy in not exposing his igno rance. /z/ Away went the schooner faster this time , for the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was no help for it ; so he kept on , with a vague expectation of some disaster . He now headed , as before , for O'RafFerty 's Island , and watched very anxiously to see how they were progressing . " You 'd better head her a little to the north'ard , Bart , " said Arthur " had n't you ? so as to allow for that current . " " Very well , " said Bart ; and he put the vessel a little closer in the direction indicated . But in doing so , the vessel began to stagger , and the sails began to flap and rattle , and Bart was filled with consternation . Hastily he restored the helm to its former position , but without any result . Then he tried his old manoeuvre , by means of which he had already turned her twice . It was of no use . The sails flapped , and the vessel danced , and Bart was about confessing his com plete ignorance of everything , when suddenly her sails filled again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off away from the island and back on the other tack . Bart 's heart was full of thankfulness , but he said not a word . He looked ahead as coolly as possible , and held the tiller as before . " Well , Bart , what are you up to now ? Why do n't you head for O'Rafferty 's ? " " Ca n't , " said Bart , laconically . " Why not ? " /z/ " Why , there are tides and currents about those islands enough to sweep away a line-of-battle ship . I do n't understand them . Did n't you see what a scrape I got into just now ? I wo n't try O'Raffer ty 's again in a hurry ; but if any of you fellows choose to try it , I do n't care . " " 0 , no , " said Bruce , " we ca n't do it if you ca n't , Bart . But where are you going now ? " " Well , I do n't know . We must make up our minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if I can find any place that looks like Pratt 's Cove , I 'll run in . The fact is , we must do something , or they 'll be frightened out of their wits about us . " " Pratt 's Cove ? But how can we ever find the place ? " " Perhaps , when we get in a little closer to the land , we may see it . " " I 'm confident , " said Bart , " that it 's somewhere along this coast ; for it seems to me , as near as I can remember , that this is the coast we sailed to . Look at the Five Islands . There 's O'Rafferty 's ; and there are the others . You see we came out from this side of O'Rafferty 's , and then sailed up somewhere along there . I think , when we get nearer , we 'll see an opening ; and perhaps we 'll hit the cove itself . " The others seemed impressed by Bart 's words ; and as none of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And now the wind blew still more freshly , and /z/ Bart looked around with dismay . On went the schooner ; but the long Ime of coast showed no opening whatever , and he had no idea what to do to extricate himself from the position in which he was . What made it worse was the confidence which all now felt in him . He felt that the end would come the moment when he would stand revealed in his true colors , and lose his prestige forever . More freshly still blew the wind , and the sea around rose higher , tossing up now into whitecapped waves , which every little while dashed over the bows and scattered their spray about the decks . Yielding to the wind , the vessel lay over ; and on she scudded , dashing through the water in a style which excited all on board , and intoxicated them with delight . " Hurrah ! " cried Bruce . " Boys , is n't this glo rious ? " " Glorious i " cried the boys ; and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others danced about the deck , shouting as each wave came splashing over the bows , and roaring with laughter when any one got a ducking . Hurrah ! and Hurrah again ! and yet again ! Their wild mirth only added new anguish to the dismay of poor Bart , who found himself now face to face with an inextricable problem . In their last stretch across from the Five Islands , they had drawn near to the main land , and were /z/ now moving nearer and nearer every moment . What was to be done ? It was already time to turn ; but where could he turn , or where would he go when he did turn ? or , for that matter , how could he venture to turn at all ? His last experience in turning the schooner had filled him with despair . What was the meaning of those kickings , and flap pings , and jumpings ? What was the reason that she did n't mind her rudder at all ? And now the wind was stronger , and the sea . was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a wind and such a sea ? He felt that he could not . Anything would be better . So he thought while taking counsel with his own soul . And while taking counsel with his own soul , he saw before him the coast extending invitingly . There was a long line of sand , or of mud , which was just as good , into which he longed to run the vessel . Which would be best to run the vessel ashore , or to make the desperate attempt to turn her again , and set her kicking and plunging ? He preferred the former . Yes , to run her ashore would solve the whole difficulty . He might be disgraced by it , but he could not help it . He felt that he was doomed to disgrace , in any event ; and it would be better to incur disgrace on a mud bank , and in safety , than when tossing and drifting he did n't know where . His mind , then , was made up ; and he kept the schooner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached it , he was aware of one very startling fact , and that was , that the schooner , while going forward , was also drifting rapidly to leeward . In the course of that sidelong motion , she was losing way so rapidly , that , instead of striking the mud flats , she might run upon a very different kind of place ; for there , on the lee bow , was a headland of dark , stern rock , at the base of which the waves were breaking into foam . In his fixed attention to the mud flats , he had not noticed this till just now , when it was full before him , and not very far away . Below this headland the mud flats appeared again . What could he do ? All seemed lost ; for the headland , and the foam ing waves , and the frowning , jagged rocks were full before him . With a bitter feeling of despair , and a pang of anguish for the coming fate of the friends who had given him their trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uproarious glee , he stood for a moment paralyzed , looking with white lips at his fate . Suddenly , and just as all seemed lost , he jerked the helm a-port . The schooner swung half round . The wind took her astern , and drove her forward . Her sails flapped and banged about . Then a cur rent seemed to seize her and carry her on for a score of yards . Suddenly there was a thump , a grinding noise , and another thump dull and heavy . In an instant all was confusion . /z/ " The rocks ! the rocks ! " cried all . " She 's truck ! " Then the schooner was once more swept on , and wave , striking her stern , dashed the tiller out of Bart 's hands , and he fell . Springing up , he seized it again , not knowing how he moved it , or when . At that moment the sails filled again , the schooner bounded forward , and in a few minutes it was beyond the headland , and moving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were saved , she drove hard and fast into the mud , with a shock that knocked them all down . Picking themselves up , they looked around at the shore in bewilderment . Then they looked at Bart , " What 's all this ? " they asked . " 0 , nothing , " said Bart . " I found we could n't do anything , and so I ran her ashore . " " By Jove ! " cried Bruce , " that was a pretty narrow scratch we had of it on those rocks . After this , Bart , I 'll always brag on you . You 've saved our lives , Bart . I thought we were gone for it . I never saw anything done so splendidly . " . For a moment Bart was silent . Here was a chance for fame . He might avail himself of the lucky accident , and turn it to his own glory . But the thought was only a passing one . It was at once dismissed . " No , boys , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly to destroy your lives . In fact , I do n't know /z/ any more about sailing a vessel than any of you . It 's been a very narrow escape . I was a fool to try it ; and I can only make amends by confessing it . I do n't believe in being a humbug , and I wo n't be one any longer . " At first the boys would n't believe him , but after a while he explained all about it . After this con fession , Bart was as much esteemed by his friends as ever . /z/ In Mud and Water . A Sea Monster . A terrific Fight . Wonderful Pluck of the " B. 0 . W. C. " Swallowing a Sculpin . TJie Trophy . Wait ing for Deliverance . flNDING themselves thus fixed in the mud , they looked around to seje the place at which they had thus unexpectedly arrived . In front of them was a bank about sixty feet high , which extended for some miles away , commencing with the rocky headland , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the country rose into hills . As far as they could see , there was no opening in the shore to indicate the presence of a cove or a harbor . From the appearance of the water , it seemed as though the mud flat extended for miles along the shore . The water was com paratively smooth , and the headland kept off the wind , so that after they had lowered the sails , the schooner remained quite still . It was now about noon , and they knew that the tide was rising . A wide space of the mud flat lay still uncovered by the water . Their position was 190 THE B. o. w. c. a safe one as yet , though not at all pleasant on many accounts . " The tide 's rising , " said Phil ; " is n't it , Bart ? " " Yes . " When will it be high tide ? " " About three . " " I wonder if they 'll come after us . " " Of course they will . " " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashore . " " Well , it does n't make much difference , for we could n't do anything if we did get there . " " I say , boys , " said Arthur , " the schooner 's be ginning to float again . " All stood waiting in silence , and in a few mo ments they felt a slight motion . " Yes , " said Bruce , " the tide has risen since we struck , and is floating us in . At high tide we shall be close up under the bank . " " And then what shall we do ? We must either choose to fasten the vessel ashore if we can , or float out again and sail for it , or drift . " " I do n't think we 'll care about sailing again , particularly as the tide will be going out , and the night coming on . " " My idea is , " said Bruce , " to fasten her to the shore if we can , and then go along the beach or the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's about all we can do , " said Bart . " Wo ca n't think of going adrift , and none of us can /z/ sail the vessel ; so , if they do n't come after us , we had better land , and leave the vessel ; or some of us can go for help , and others stay on board . " " I wonder if the vessel is safe here . " " 0 , safe enough if a gale do n't spring up . In that case she might get knocked on the bank . " " We do n't seem to have been hurt by our knocking up there , " said Arthur . " There 's no water in the hold . " " 0 , she 's all right , " said Bruce ; " and she 's a gallant , gallant ship , as the song says . " . The vessel was steadily floated nearer and nearer to the shore as the tide rose , and the boys watched her progress with close attention . At about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then they would have to find some way to fasten her . Suddenly Bart , who had been looking down the shore , pointed to something , and said , " Look , look ! Do you see that ? " What ? " " Do n't you see a line running along about a mile away ? " " What , a thin , dark line ? Yes . What of it ? " " Why , it 's a wier for fish . It shows that people must be living not far from here . It shows , too , that we can get something to eat at low tide , even if there are no people . So , hurrah , boys ! we 're all right yet . " " The fact is , " said Bruce , solemnly , " I must /z/ confess that I 'm starving . I 've felt the pangs of hunger for the last two hours , and I ca n't stand it any longer . I 'm going to have a regu lar rummage down below , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest followed Bruce as he went below , and they began to overhaul the whole vessel . For some time they found nothing but a beggarly array of empty boxes , and loud were their mur murs and complaints . " If it had n't been for that miserable Sammy Ram Ram , we 'd have a few turkeys and chickens here , " said Bruce . " How that fellow and Johnny Blue managed to get through with them all , I ca n't understand . " " Pooh ! those two fellows did nothing else but stuff from the time they came on board till they got to Pratt 's Cove . Captain Corbet and the mate helped them , and so did Pat , too , no doubt . I have n't any hard feeling against any of them , but I must say I would n't be sorry if their food did n't agree with them . " " Hallo ! What 's this ? Hurrah ! " cried Tom , suddenly . " What , Tom , what is it ? " " See here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in luck ? Do n't ever fret again , boys . Here 's a half loaf of bread that I found in the corner . It 's rather stale , a little too dry , and too hard , but I think it 's about the nicest morsel I ever saw . /z/ We 've got our dinner provided for us , and we need n't hanker after raw fish from the wiers any more . " Tom 's joy was fully shared by all ; and the half loaf of hard , stale , dried-up bread was quickly divided into five pieces , and eagerly devoured by the famished boys . " And now , " said Bruce , " I feel like a giant re freshed . I 'll go on deck and have another look at the situation . My private opinion is , however , that if they 're coming after us , they 'd better come . The tide 's getting higher every minute ; and if they get here after we 've fastened her to the shore , and got her high and dry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can get her to float off again , not to speak of spring tides . Do you know , Bart , if this is spring tide ? " " I do n't know , I 'm sure , " said Bart . " Well , then , we 'll have to trust to luck , I sup pose . At the same time I 've a great mind to go ashore and reconnoitre . " " I 'll go too , " said Bart . " And so will I , " said Arthur . " And I , " said Phil . " I 'll go too , " said Tom . " But ought n't some of us to stay on board ? " " Stay on board ? What for ? " " 0 , to watch the vessel . " " Why , what good will that do ? " " She may drift off . " /z/ " Well , why should any of us want to drift off in her ? " " I do n't believe there 's any chance of her drift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce ; " and if she does drift off , I think we 're all better out of her than in her . So if one of us goes ashore , Ave 'd all better go . It 's not more than three feet deep at the bows , and there 's a sand-spit over there within easy distance . " " I wonder if there are any quicksands. " " 0 , we 'll have to run the risk . There are a couple of boat-hooks there , and two of us can go ahead and try the ground with them . It 's not far to the spit . " " We 'll have to strip and carry our clothes with us , " said Phil . " Yes . It would be a great joke if we left our clothes behind , and the vessel drifted off with them . " The boys now proceeded to undress themselves , and prepare to go ashore . Each one tied up his clothes in a compact bundle . Bruce and Bart took each a boat-hook , which lay in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phil found a stout stick each . Thus equipped , they prepared for the journey . It was about one o'clock , and the tide would not be high . for two hours yet . In front of them , and between them - and the bank , lay a broad expanse of mud flats , separating them from the bank by at /z/ least a quarter of a mile of distance . On their right , however , was a place which gave them a chance of a much better foothold than that which was offered by the slippery and treacherous mud . This was a long sand-spit , which stretched out from the bank , and ran down across the mud flat and into the water . It approached to within a hundred yards of the schooner , and afforded not only a good walking-place , but a much nearer chance of dry land than was possible anywhere else . Running down over the flat , it rose above it to a height of from twelve to twenty inches , and was covered with sand , gravel , and round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to go . Bruce led the way . Descending carefully over the bows , he dropped into the water , which he found up to his armpits . The others followed , and found it deeper for their shorter stature . It was over the shoulders of Bart and Phil . Bart , however , took his place by Bruce 's side , and pre pared to walk ahead with his pole . Their first object was to get into shallower water , and so they walked in the direction of the shore until the water was not above their waists . Then they turned to the right , toward the sand-spit . If it had not been for the bundles , they could have varied their progress by swimming ; but as it was , they had to wade , and feel the way cau tiously , for fear of air-holes and quicksands . The /z/ surface mud beneath their feet was very soft ; but they did not sink very deeply , and with every step they acquired fresh confidence . As they neared the sand-spit , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was not much above their knees . At length it became a sandy bottom , and they walked along more rapidly , no longer feeling their way . Suddenly they were startled by a wild shout from Arthur . He had been walking behind with Phil , and was some distance from the others , when rapidly , between him and them , darted the form of a large fish , which , in that shoal water , was as visible as if it were on land . At the cry which ho gave , Bruce and the others turned , and saw Arthur with his handspike in the air , and the fish flounder ing and splashing close beside . For a moment the blood of all of them froze with horror ; the next instant Arthur sprang forward , and dealt a tre mendous blow with his heavy handspike full on the head of the fish . The monster splashed and struggled , and movec back into deeper water for a few feet . " Run , run ! " cried Arthur . " It 's a shark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off as fast as they could towai the sand-spit , which now was close by them . But the fish was not to be easily escaped . In a few minutes it 's dark form was beside them , and soon it crossed immediately in front of Bruce and /z/ Jart . Mechanically , and in utter horror , both the swung up their boat-hooks , and dashed them wildly against the dark figure . Both struck home . There was a fearful splashing and writhing . Bart 's boat-hook was wrenched from his hand , and the fish darted forward into shoaler water . " Run , boys , run " ! " shouted Bruce , holding his boat-hook toward the fish , and slowly retreating , so as to keep the monster in sight . Away they went , Phil and Tom first , then Arthur . Bart moved forward , and then , seeing his pole floating a few feet on one side , made a rush for it and secured it . Then he kept by Brace 's side , ready to help him in guarding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writhe about , either because he was bewildered by the shoal water , or else because he was suffering from the wounds which had been inflicted . As he did not pursue , Bruce and Bart took fresh courage . ' Let 's finish him , Bruce ! " cried Bart . " Pitch in , then ! " cried Bruce ; and rushing at the fish , he drove his boat-hook point deep into his side , while , at the same time , Bart , raising his into the air , struck down , so that the hooked part pene trated and held . " Hook him , Bruce ! " shouted Bart . " Let 's drag him ashore . " Bruce raised his pole to do so ; but at that instant the struggling , writhing fish turned towards them with furious energy , and moving over on its side , it tried to twist Bart 's /z/ hook out of its flesh . The water was so shallowthat it could not have full exercise of its strength , and Bart held on . The fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing wide rows of sharp , triangular teeth . At that instant Bruce lowered his pole , and drove it straight into the open mouth , - forcing it deep into the throat . The monster , in its agony , closed its jaws , and held it with a death like tenacity . A cry of triumph burst from Bruce and Bart . " Hurrah , boys ! We 've got him ! " they cried . " Pull , Bruce , nearer the shore into shoaler water . " The water was already too shoal for the fish , which had so carelessly thrown himself into it , and his resistance could not prevent the united energies of Bruce and Bart from dragging him forward a few paces . But that was all . Rousing himself , the monster tossed , and writhed and struggled , and lashed the water into foam . Bruce and Bart could no longer drag him . It was a struggle between them ; but the boys had now got their blood up , and they would have been dragged back to the schooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fury or its agony , still kept its teeth closed on Bruce 's pole , and strove to wrench it out of his grasp . His tremendous efforts were prevailing against their united strength , and were dragging them farther out . Bart 's hook had already been thrown off , and he was plunging /z/ the pointed iron again and again into the fish 's side . At this instant Arthur came dashing through the foam . Raising his heavy handspike in the air , he poised it for a moment so as to take sure aim , and then , with tremendous force , the weapon descended full on the monster 's head . It was a crushing blow . The struggles and writhings ceased , and changed to feeble motions and oc casional convulsive vibrations . It resisted no longer . It was powerless . They dragged it upon the dry ground of the sand-spit , and examined their conquest . The fish was about five feet long , very broad at the head and shoulders , with a very wide mouth , armed with several rows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jaw was underneath . ' Its back was a dark slate color , and its belly white . " It 's what we call a Shovel-mouth Shark , " said Bruce , as he looked at it , and admired its pro portions . " They call it a Dog Fish with us , " said Bart . " It certainly is a kind of shark , " said Arthur ; " and as that sounds better , we 'll call it by that name . Boys , we 've fought and killed a shovelmouth shark ! Let the ' B. 0 . W. C. ' remember that ! " " We must keep his jaws as a trophy , " said Bruce . " Let 's cut him up and get his jaws . Who 's got a knife ? " /z/ " Here , " said Arthur . Thereupon , with the aid of the knife , the fish was dissected . In the stomach they found a fish quite as remarkable as the one which had swalloved it . It was a sculpin , a fish whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and wonderful vo racity , make it seem like those primeval fish that swam in the waters of the world in an age when all the inhabitants thereof were formed on a similarly monstrous model . " What a fish , " cried Bart , " to swallow a scul pin ! He must be a real shark , after all , for a shark could not beat that . I thought that it might have been by accident only that he met us , but it seems now as though he was ravenous enough to mean mischief . Ton my word , if I 'd known about that ' sculpin , I think I would have run away instead of staying to fight . " After examining the fish , the jaws were removed , and , carrying them , they walked up the sand-spit to the shore . Then dressing themselves , they sat down and rested for a time . Then Bruce and Bart climbed to the top of the bank , and went in different directions to explore . On coming back , each had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees and alder bushes , and had not seen a sign of any house whatever . On this they all decided to go to the top of the bank , and wait patiently until the tide was high , then fasten the schooner as well as they could , leave a message on board to /z/ indicate their course , and set off along the coast in search of inhabitants . With this decision , they climbed the bank to a conspicuous position , and there waited . The tide rose higher and higher . Each increase in the depth of the water allowed the schooner to approach nearer to the shore , though there was a sidelong drift , which , from time to time , changed her position , sometimes presenting her bows to the beach , at other times her side . The water was rising higher and still higher . The mud flats extended close up to the beach below , butthe beach itself was formed of sand and gravel , and rose , by a steep slope , from the mud flat to the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the gravel . " It will take an hour more , " said Bruce , " before it gets to high-water mark . One hour more , boys , and then off we must go to explore the country . " /z/ Scratching for Clams . How not to eat them . Fearful Consequences of Folly . A formidable Medicine Chest . Prevention better than Cure . kEANWHILE the people at Pratt 's Cove waited for the return of the captain and his company . The boys had excited the deepest sympathy of Mrs. Pratt by their loss of appetite , and she was anxious about the lost vessel . They had not eaten anything for tea ; and after the meal was over , they walked down to their old place . It was about half past six o'clock , and a large part of the cove was already uncovered by the receding tide . " I wonder if there 's any duck left , " said Jiggins , with a sigh . " Or roaster , " said Muckle , with another sigh . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny have disposed av thim . " Sammy and Johnny both looked innocently down , and by their silence acknowledged . the soft im peachment . " I 've a presentiment , " said Jiggins , " that I 'm going to be very hungry before bed time . " /z/ " I should n't wonder if some of the rest of us rere like you , " said Muckle . " And now , " said Jiggins , in a grave and solemn tone , " what ought we to do ? " " We have n't much time left , " said Muckle , sug gestively . " Something must be done , " said Jiggins , em phatically . " And soon , too , " added Muckle . " Deed , thin , an ' why do n't ye go aff an ' do somethin ' ? " said Pat , energetically . " Come , now , whatever ye do , I 'm yer man . Is it another duck ye mane ? " Jiggins shook his head . " It would hardly do " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . " The fact is , I have my doubts about it . I do n't think it 's altogether right . " " Thin what made ye ate it for ? " said Pat . " There wor others that thought it was all right they did . " " I felt badly while eating it . I felt it was not right . " " Do ye mane it was n't done right ? " Jiggins shook his head . Well , " said Pat , " if ye did n't like the duck , how did ye like the pig ? Ye 'll not be findin ' fault witli that , I think . " Jiggins shook his head . /z/ " I have my doubts . " " 0 , botheration take your doubts . Why did n't ye doubt before ye sat down ? " Jiggins shook his head . " I tell you what , " said Muckle ; " I 've got an idea . " " What ? " cried all . " Clams ! " said Muckle . " Clams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muckle , waving his hand over to ward the flats ; " do you see that ? " " Yes . " " Well , it 's full of clams . " " Why , of course of course , " said Jiggins . " Why , so it is . What do you say , boys ? " " I say this , " cried Pat . " Hurroo , boys ! if we ca n't have a duck , or a roaster , again , we 'll have clams . " " Hand along a basket then , Sammy , " said Jiggins . As Sammy gave him one , he said , " Now , you two , are you coming ? " " Well no we do n't care about it , " said Sammy . " Well , you wait here and kindle the fire , and get a pot ready . We 'll cook them the moment we get back . " " All right , " said the two boys . Upon this Jiggins , and Muckle , and Pat started off after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some sticks to use for scraping up the sand , and then directed their steps toward the creek . The creek ran through the middle of the cove , and on each side of it the wide flats extended up to the shore . These , toward the lower part of the cove , were formed of soft mud , but at the upper part they consisted of sand , in which appeared a multi tude of little holes , which are generally called breathing-holes , about these parts , under the im pression that they serve this purpose for the clams . By digging where these little holes are seen , the clams may be found buried in the sand and mud . Toward the upper place they walked rapidly and eagerly , and looked anxiously around for the " breathing-holes . " " Here , " said Muckle . " There are lots here . " Both went toward where he stood . " See , " said he , pointing to the sand , which was dotted with little holes all around the place where they were standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sure sign . " " So it is , " said Jiggins . " Well , let 's go in . " " An ' is there oysters here , too ? " asked Pat . " No ; only clams . " " It 's sorry I am for that same , thin . Oysters are a dale betther . " " O , clams ai n't bad , " said Muckle , " when you ca n't get oysters . So pitch in , Jiggins. " /z/ And Muckle , taking his stick , began to scoop up the sand . Jiggins began to do the same ; and for some time both worked diligently . " Pooh ! " said Jiggins , at last . " That stick 's no good . " " No good ? Why not ? " " It wo n't hold the sand . " " Mine does very well . " " Well , I might as- well have nothing . It 's like trying to eat rice with a chopstick , Chinese fashion . I 'm going to try another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , like the hens . I 'm going to scratch for my food , " said Jiggins . " What were fingers made for ?

" " Whatever I scratch up ? " " Yes if they 're clams . " " But you 'll have to eat them raw . " " Well , sure it 's raw I mane . " " Why , man alive , it 'll make you sick . " " I 'll risk it . Sick is it ? Not a bit of it . " " Did you ever eat any raw clams , Pat ? " " Av coorse . Why not ? and raw oysters , too . " /z/ " Well , you wo n't blame me ? " " Is it blame ? Not a bit of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll scratch for you then . " " Go ahead , thin . " So Jiggins began , and scratched for some time . " Here 's your first clam , " said he , throwing out one to Pat . Pat opened it , and swallowed it with extraor dinary celerity . " Does n't that look as if I knowed how ? " said he , biting off the black tip of the clam , and throw ing it down . " Scratch them along , my boy . " " All right ; here 's another . " " An ' here 's to your very good health , an ' long life to ye , " said Pat , as he swallowed it . " Here 's another and here and here and here , too and here 's three . " " Faith , thin , the more the merrier , and it 's meself that 's glad to see thim same , " said Pat , as he seized and opened them , one by one , and sent them flying after the others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jiggins , after he had scratched for some time . " Sure I feel better than iver ; an ' why not ? " ' ' All right . Here are some more . Go it , Pat . " " Go it it is , " said Pat , seizing the clams with undiminished avidity , and devouring them . " Here 's more , Pat . Do n't blame me if you see the ghost of your grandmother in your dreams to night . And here 's more . Do n't blame me if you /z/ have the gripes , and have to stand on your head all night . " " Niver you fare for me ; but you go on wid yer scratching an ' let me ate in pace . " The clams now came forth fast and furious . Muckle had found a place filled with them , and hud heaped up his basket . Jiggins had a large pile on the sand , in front of which Pat had taken his station , and was vainly trying to keep up with Jiggins . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely packed together . " What 's the matter over there ? " said Muckle . " Have you filled your basket , Jiggins ? " " Not yet . I 'm busy filling Pat , " said Jiggins . " Hallo , Pat , you 're slow about it . " " Niver fare . Slow is it ? Thin I 'll be up wid ye before long . On'y give me time , as the school master said when they wor examinin ' him on the alphabet . " " All right . But while I 'm waiting , I 'll put these in the basket , " said Jiggins ; and he began to fill his basket from the pile . " How can I ate them when you 're putting thci in the basket ? " said Pat . " I 'll dig up plenty more enough to keep you going . " But Jiggins was tired ; and after digging up some more he found the sand tinged red . To his amazement he saw that his nails were worn away , and were now bleeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and ho was compelled to desist . " I think I 'll be off , " said he . " Pat , you may eat from the basket . " " From the basket , is it ? Not a bit of it , " said Pat ; " I 'll only eat from your scratching . " " I 've scratched the basket full for you , and that 's enough . In fact it 's too much , " he added , as he felt fresh stings on his finger tips . " Besides , I 've my doubts about it . " " Yer doubts , is it ? and again ? An ' what for this time ? " " Well , you see , I 'm afraid it 's not altogether fair to you . " " You 're a quare bird , wid yer doubts , an ' that 's ah 1 about it , " said Pat . They then went back to the bank , where a bright fire was burning , and the pot was all ready , with sea-water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and sitting down around the fire , they waited . Pat sat in silence . There was a peculiar ex* pression on his face . He grew moody and pre occupied . Frequent sighs escaped him . " What 's the matter , Pat ? " asked Jiggins. " 0 , nothin ' . " Pat struggled against his secret grief most valiantly , but soon ho could struggle no longer . A deep groan burst from him , and he fell back doubled up and writhing . His face was deadly /z/ pale , and big drops of perspiration stood on his brow . In his pain he rolled over and over , and moans and low cries escaped him . " It 's the clams ! " cried Jiggins. " 0 , I knew it . I had my doubts about it all the time . " " What can we do ? " cried Johnny . " We 'll have to get him up to Captain Pratt 's , " said Muckle . But for a long time they could do nothing . He writhed and struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Blue ran up for Mrs. Pratt . The good lady came down with a basket full of infallible remedies , and tended poor Pat for some time . At last he was easier , and they managed to get him up to the house , and put him in bed . Jiggins went back with the others , and finished the clams . All were silent except Jiggins , who , every little while , would solemnly shake his head , and slowly ejaculate , " It was not right . No , boys , it was not right . I felt so , for I had my doubts about it all the time . " One thing surprised Mrs. Pratt when she was administering to Pat 's woes on the bank ; and that was , the very savory smell of that clam stew which was simmering in a pot behind the bushes . She could not understand it , but concluded that it must be some great delicacy among the vessel 's stores lying on the bank , which had so very fragrant an /z/ odor . Afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pat had been well rubbed , and poulticed , and blistered , and plied with herb tea , and all those other medicaments which the " medi cine women " of the rural districts love so well ; after all this had been attended to , then she began to think once more about that fragrant odor . And gradually , as she thought about it , there arose in her mind a conjecture as to what that odor might have arisen from ; and the conjecture gathered itself inseparably around the idea of " clams . " To Mrs. Pratt that thought was a momentous one . For what did that involve ? It meant that there was danger abroad , danger which impended over the young charges committed to her , and which she must counteract . It meant that some of them had been eating clams in the month of May an act which , in her estimation , might produce consequences which could only bo called terrible . In the face of this great possible danger , Mrs. Pratt gathered herself up , and prepared to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roused into full play by the case of Pat , and having begun a good work , it was not easy to stop abruptly . She had got her hand in , as the saying is , and she wanted to finish her work . It did not take long for her to come to the stern conclusion that the work must be fully completed . /z/ So she first of all brought forth her little store of medicaments of all kinds , and ranged them on the kitchen table . They presented a formidable show . There were , 1 bottle Mint tea . 1 " Essence of peppermint . 1 " Ginger extract . 1 " Cayenne pepper extract . 1 " Paregoric. 1 " Rum and onions . 1 " Sulphur and molasses . 1 " Sour cream . 1 " Eye wash . 1 " Pratt 's pain kiUer. 1 " Hemlock water . 1 " Tar water . 1 " Poppy juice . 1 " Essence of smoke . /z/ 1 bottle Salt and treacle . 1 " Antibilious mixture . 1 " Arnica. 1 " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sweet oil . 1 " Benzine. 1 " Grease eradicator. 1 " Lye . 1 " Tobacco water . 1 " Wild honey . 1 " Lime juice . 1 " Alcohol . 1 " Cod liver oil . 1 " Neats foot oil . In addition to these , she had , 1 parcel " Wormwood. /z/ /z/ 1 pot /z/ Spearmint . Peppermint . Beeswax . Eoot ginger . Cloves . Alum . Magnesia . Balm of Gilead . Horseradish . Flagroot . Sarsaparilla . Sassafras . Soap . Pomatum . Lard . Lint . Senna . Mucilage . Salts . Cotton wool . Diachylon . Mustard . Calomel . Blue pills . Cantharides . Garlic . White lead . And a great many other things , which had ac cumulated in her closet , and which she now /z/ brought forth for the especial benefit of the four boys . Having selected some from among these , she sat calmly awaiting their return . When the boys came back from the bank , . where they had been enjoying their clam stew , . this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a table filled with bottles and vials , another table filled with parcels and bundles , and on the floor jugs , boxes , kegs , firkins , and bags , in the midst of all of which sat Mrs. Pratt , with her eyes gleaming , from behind her spectacles , upon them , and an expression of benev olent yet unshakable resolution upon her face . The boys entered one by one , and took their seats , looking suspiciously around . There was something in the general appearance of things which did not altogether satisfy them . " Ehem ehe-e-em ! " said Jiggins , at last , to whom the suspense was becoming intolerable . A long silence followed . " Ehem ! " he remarked again ; but Mrs. Pratt made no answer . " Ehe-e-em ! " he remarked a third time . " Is ah is Pat ah any better ? " " Considerable , " said Mrs. Pratt . " Yes , con siderable . " " That 's right that 's good . I feel very much relieved . I 've blamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mrs. Pratt gave a long sigh . /z/ " What do you mean ? " she asked . " You all had clams , as well as he . You had a clam stew . Why should he suffer more'n you'ns ? " The boys started , and looked at one another . How in the world had Mrs. Pratt found out about the clams ? They felt uneasy at first , but soon recollected that , after all , cooking clams was no harm . So they regained their courage . " Why , you see , " said Jiggins , at last , " it was different with Pat . We had them cooked , but he ate them raw . " " And you think that makes any difference , " said Mrs. Pratt , grimly . " Why , certainly of course , " said Jiggins , looking at Mrs. Pratt anxiously ; while all the other boys stared at her in dire anticipation of some fear ful disclosure . " Not a mite , " said Mrs. Pratt . " There is n't a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and him , on'y he was kind o ' took bad at onst , an ' you 're a waitin ' . Let me see . How long is it since you finished eatin ' ? " " 0 , only a few minutes , " said Jiggins , ner vously . " Well , I supposed so . Ve-ry well , " repeated Mrs. Pratt , in the tone of a cool physician , who feels gratified when a disease takes the form he suspected , even when it is attended with pain and danger to the patient . " Yes , that 's it ; and now can you remember how long a time it was after /z/ ' at had done eating the raw clams to the fust in he felt ? " The boys looked in fearful anxiety at one another , and then all eyes turned to Jiggins . He turned pale , and all the expression of his face hanged to one dismal blank . " Ca n't any of you remember ? " repeated Mrs. ratt . " How long was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Jiggins , in a faltering voice , " it 's about I should think somewhere near perhaps the neigh borhood of half an hour that is , more or less . " " About half an hour . I thought so , " said Mrs. Pratt , remorselessly . " Somewhere about that , " said Jiggins . " Till he felt his fust pains ? " " Yes . " " Well , " said Mrs. Pratt , with a benevolent smile , " somewhere about half an hour from this you 'll feel the same . " She paused , and watched the effect of this fear ful announcement . The effect was powerful . Four pale faces looked , with awful eyes , at her , and at one another . Not a word was spoken in reply . " Yes , every one of you . You 've all eaten , I s'pose . " Jiggins nodded mournfully . " And plenty , too . " Another nod . t /z/ " Very well . You 'll have it hot and heavy , mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite comfortable just as you begin to get took . " " But but , " said Jiggins , rousing himself despairingly , " I thought that is , I always heard that clams were good stewed and I never heard that even raw clams were bad , except when you took too many of them . " " Shows how your parients neglected your edication , " said Mrs. Pratt , loftily . " They did n't un derstand the natur ' of the clam , certain . It is n't the cooking , or the not cooking , of the clam that makes it so dangerous ; it 's the clam itself or rather , the clam at this season of the year . That 's what makes it dangerous . " " This season of the year ? Why , what 's that got to do with it ? " " Have n't you ever heard of that ? Dear ! dear ! dear 1 An ' yet you go to the Academy , and do n't know about clams . Dear ! dear ! dear ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jiggins , morosely . " So you do n't know the danger there is in eat ing them now . " " No . " " Well , I 'll tell you they 're pison ! " " Poison ! " ejaculated the others , in horror at the thrilling whisper in which Mrs. Pratt hurled this word at them . " Yes , pison ! Hai n't you ever heerd the old lines , /z/ ' In the months without the " R , " Clams a deadly pison are ' ? That means May , June , July , and August . Another verse , says , ' In August , May , July , and June , All shell fishes lead to ruin . ' That means , you see , that in the summer months these things are as bad as pison . " " " What shall we do ? " cried Jiggins , after a long , despairing silence , in which these fearful words sank deep into the hearts of all . " What shall we do ? " " Well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd ort ter be thankful that you 've got me . I am jest the person to treat your case . I 've got the medicine all ready . If you take it in time , you may avoid trouble . As there 's only been a few minutes sence you ate the pison clams , p'raps you may get off without much pain . I 've jest got some herb tea , some drinks of different kinds , some mustard poultices , and two or three more mixtures for you . I wo n't bleed any of you if I can help it . Only jest give yourselves up to me , and trust to me . But there must be no delay . I have the mixtures all ready . " Saying this , Mrs. Pratt rose like an ogress , and advanced upon the unhappy boys . Filled with fears of poison , looking upon her as their only safety , they made no resistance , but swallowed , /z/ one by one , the nauseous mixtures which were given . And still she stood over them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them more medicaments . Then came the mustard plasters . But enough . Let us draw a curtain over the sufferings of the unhappy four . /z/ Tew Hopes and Plans . A Sail I A bitter Dis appointment . A hazardous Adventure , and a Frigid . Quilts for Togas . Another tremen dous Casualty . HERE , on the top of the bank , sat the five boys of the " B. 0 . W. C. , " waiting patiently . " Only an hour more , boys , " repeated Bruce . " Well , if they do n't come , we 'll survive it , " said Bart . " I suppose we shall start off at once , if they do n't come . " " Yes , as soon as the tide begins to fall . " " I wonder if it will carry the schooner with it . " " I think that it will . " " Perhaps it will leave it aground . " " All right . That will be so much the better for us . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O , she wo n't be lost . " " Yes , she will . What 'll prevent her ? She 'll be carried ashore on some rocks and broken to pieces , or she 'll drift out into the Bay of Fundy . " /z/ " 0 , she has other chances in her favor . She may drift on some mud-flat like this , or she may be picked up on the basin , or , if she does get out into the Bay of Fundy , she may get picked up there . " " That may be ; but , after all , it 'll be hard on Corbet ; and he 's rather poor . " " It 'll serve him right , " exclaimed Tom Crawford . " He must have known that his anchor was broken . " " Well , it certainly does serve him right , if he knew that ; but he 's a careless fellow , and I dare say he did n't know anything about it . " " I wonder where this coast goes ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directions , " said Bart . " Which way do you mean ? " " The right . " " 0 , that goes to Parrsboro ' Village ; the left leads up to Pratt 's Cove . " " How do you know ? " " I ca n't tell just where Pratt 's Cove is , but I know the direction in which it must lie from here , " said Bart . " You can tell that by seeing the way the Five Islands lie toward us . If they come for us , they 'll have to come from behind that headland . " " I wonder if they 'll come by land or water . " " I do n't see how they can come by land . " " There 's a road , I suppose . " " O , ever so far back . How could any one find anything about us on the road ? No ; they 'll /z/ come by water , so as to find us either afloat or ashore . " " There is n't any boat at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be other coves near , where they can get other boats . " " It will be hard for us , if they do n't happen to have a boat . " " 0 , they 'll get one . " " And meanwhile we must act for ourselves ; for I do n't believe they 'll get one to-day , at any rate . " " Yes , we may as well prepare for an expedition along the coast . " " Shall we separate , or go together ? " " 0 , together , by all means . But , hallo ! what 's that ? " At this exclamation from Bart , all looked where his eyes were turned . " A schooner ! " they cried ; " a schooner ! There they come ! . Hurrah , boys ! we 're all right . " Instantly every one sprang to his feet . " Come , boys , take off your shirts , " said Bruce , as he pulled off his own . " Let 's get ready a sup ply of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them tore off their shirts , and waved them wildly from the top of the bank . Yes , it was a schooner . It had come thus sud denly upon them as they were talking ; and even though they had been on the constant lookout , yet its appearance had startled them all . It was twice as large as the Antelope , of a bright green color j /z/ its masts were yellow , and its sails beautifully neat . Spreading its snow-white wings to the breeze , it came bounding over the waves from behind the headland , and directed its course in toward the shore . " She 's not heading for us at all , " said Bruce . " If she keeps on in that direction , she 'll be a mile down beyond us before we know it . " " She do n't see us , " said Bart . " Wave your signals , then ! Ah , what a pity we had n't a good signal-post ! " " I 'll climb a tree , " said Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit for the purpose . The highest ones are hidden by the smaller ones in front . This is as conspicuous a place as we can find . " Meanwhile the schooner kept on at an angle with them , and pursued her way without taking any notice of them , heading toward a point far down to the right of the place where they were standing . With a face of stern determination , and the air of a captain of a battery , Bart drew his pistol . . " I 'll fire , " said he , solemnly . The next instant , bang ! or , rather , pop ! went the pistol . But the schooner took not the smallest notice even of that overpowering demonstration . On the contrary , it kept straight on without altering its course . /z/ " They 're blind , and deaf , too ; and that 's all about it , " cried Phil Kennedy , in deep disgust . " I wonder what 's the matter with them , " said Bruce . " They do n't keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . There 's red flannel enough here to be seen five miles off . " " I wonder who is steering . " " I wonder who those two chaps are in the bow . Can it be Bogud and the mate ? " " I wonder who that old boy in a pea-jacket can be ? It surely ca n't be Mr. Simmons ? " " It 's Captain Corbet . " " Nonsense ! Captain Corbet is steering . " " No , that 's the mate . " " It is n't , either . Do n't you see the mate on the bow ? " " That the mate ! That 's Mr. Long . " " Bah 1 Mr. Long do n't generally go in his shirt sleeves . " " Why should n't he ? I s'pose he is helping the others . He 'd just as soon take off his coat as not , if he had anything to do . " " It is n't Mr. Long , any way . " But these wonders and conjectures were now interrupted by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already gone beyond the spot where the boys were standing , and had come to within half a mile of the beach . She now wore round . Flap went the sails ! there was a quick movement on board , and then away she went on /z/ another tack , with her head turned toward the opposite shore . " She 's leaving us ! " cried Bruce , aghast . For a few moments all stood in silent dismay . This was a thing which they were not prepared for . If no schooner had come at all , they could easily have borne up ; but now , since one had come , they had not for a moment doubted their speedy deliverance . There was not hope , but certainty , in her appearance . But now this was dashed to the ground , and the reaction was extreme . Bart was the first to break the silence . " I tell you what , boys , " he cried , " I do n't be lieve it was them at all . " " 0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recognized Captain Corbet . " " No ; you may depend upon it , you were utterly mistaken . Why , do you suppose , if they were after us , they would have come and gone so coolly ? There was n't the slightest sign of any anxiety or curiosity about them . If it had been our friends , they 'd have seen our signals soon enough . " " Yes , and the Antelope down there nearly ashore . " " Well , I do n't know . But I certainly thought I recognized Captain Corbet . " " I thought I saw Bogud . " " Not a bit of it . They were strangers , and that accounts for everything . " " And now , " said Tom , " all that we 've got to /z/ do is to wait for a few minutes more , and then start . " " I say , boys , " said Bart , after a fit of musing , " what a pity it is that we ca n't fasten the vessel somehow , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bottom of the bank big enough to moor a ship at . If we could only get a line around it from the schooner , we could keep the vessel here till they did come . " " Yes , that would be the best plan , " said Bruce ; . " for I 've been thinking that we may find some people here who would sail the schooner back to the cove . It would be a great pity to let her drift . " " It 's a pity that we ca n't get at her , " said Arthur . " And why ca n't we ? " asked Bart . Why ! The question at once made every one tare and think . Each one could answer in his own mind why such a thing could not be done , but no one stated such a reason . All were silent . " It 's not very far , " said Bart . " No . " " Not so far as it was to wade when we landed . " " That 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . it . " " Ah , that 's all very well ! " said Phil . " But who will try it ? " " Well , then , /will , " said Bart . " 0 , then , if it comes to that , I 'll go too , " said ruce. /z/ " So will I , " said Arthur . " And I , " said Phil . " And I 'll be with you , boys , " said Tom . . " Of course you will , " said Bart . " But what 's the use of all of us going . Two of us will be enough . Bruce and I can take our poles and do it . It 's not much any way . " " And I 'll go with my handspike , " said Arthur . " In fact , I do n't think we need even boat-hooks , " said Bruce . " The bottom is hard sand just there , all the way out to the vessel . It 's as safe as a floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Arthur , hold ing up the jaw of the fish . " Hm ! " said Bruce . " For my part , I do n't believe there 's any danger just here . It 's too near the bank , I never heard of them coming in so near high-water mark ; but , at the same time , I dare say it will be better to take the boat-hooks . " " O , yes . We 'll feel safer , " said Bart , " and that 's something . One advantage will be , that we wo n't be bothered with our bundles . " " How do you propose to do ? " asked Bruce . " Well , to board her and get a line . " " Will any of the lines be strong enough ? " " Well , my idea is , to let down the chain , fasten the rope to the anchor stump , and all of us can then drag it ashore . We can then wait till the tide brings the vessel near enough for us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree . " /z/ " That ought to hold it , " said Arthur . " Of course it will . " " Very well then . Let 's start . And first of all , let 's strip . " " I 'll take the pistol , Bart , " said Phil , as Bart laid it down before taking off his belt ; " and if any thing happens , I 'll fire . " " All right , my son , " said Bart . They all went down then to the beach below , where they stripped , and the adventurous five went into the water , although only three were going on board ; for Tom and Phil , felt bound in honor to share the possible peril of the others . The water had risen a little up the steep de clivity of the pebbled beach , and the vessel was some distance nearer than she had been when they first climbed the bank . It was a . favorable time for starting , but not so much so as it would be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ im patient to delay , and so they started . As it was , they had not more than fifty yards to go . The bottom was not muddy just here , but com posed of hard x sand , like the sand-spit on which they had landed . The water was quite smooth , only disturbed by a gentle ripple , which , farther out , rose into small waves . The descent , like that farther out , was but very gradual , and it was only by almost imperceptible degrees that the water deepened . Bruce and Bart went first , with their poles held /z/ in their hands in such a way that they were able to splash the water before them , so that if there should chance to be any more " shovel-mouth sharks " near by , they might take notice and govern themselves accordingly . For they firmly believed that all fish are frightened by any splashing , and deterred , just as wild animals are frightened and deterred , by the flashing of flames . Tom and Phil followed more slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Uio pistol . The distance was quickly traversed . The water grew deeper and deeper , until it was up to Bruce 's armpits and Bart 's shoulders . By that time they touched the schooner 's bows . At that instant a splash was heard close by them , and the movement of some body was felt amid the waters . " Up ! Quick ! " cried Bruce . " You go first , " said Bart . " I wo n't , " cried Bruce . " Nor will I , " said Bart . Bruce said no more . He stooped down , and clasping Bart in his brawny arms , he jerked him up out of the water . Bart clambered on board , and held out his hand to Bruce . Another instant and the latter stood by his side . Arthur followed at the same time . " Did you see that ? " asked Arthur . " Yes . Did you ? " " Yes . What was it ? " /z/ " Another shovel-mouth shark was n't it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same color . It was white . " " Perhaps it turned over to bite . " Arthur shook his head . " ' No . It came between us . It was not so larg &; as that other fellow . It dashed off at once . " " Perhaps it was only a codfish/ ' said Bart . " Well , it was a large one , then . It might have been a porpoise . I wonder if porpoises come so near the shore . " " Sometimes , but not often . " " I should n't wonder if it was a sturgeon , " said Arthur . " After all , it may only have been a cod fish . At the same time I 'd much rather be here than down here . " " Boys ! " shouted Bruce to Tom and Phil . " Boys , you may as well go ashore and dress . We 'll stay here a little while . It 'll take some time to get things ready . " At this Tom and Phil went back and dressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very solemnizing effect on their minds . There came over them a horror of that treacherous water . They felt an aversion toward venturing in again , and were sorry that they had come . But there was no help for it . There they were now , though each one felt that he could not venture back again into the water very readily . It might have been a sturgeon , or a porpoise , or even a /z/ codfish ; but the horror of its presence was still there , whatever it was . It was some time before they could rally from the panic which had filled them as they tumbled on board . And though each said but little about it , and alluded to it very lightly , yet each one understood pretty truly the feelings of the others . " Come , boys , hurry up ! " This was the cry that Phil and Tom sent them from the beach . They had dressed , and " were watching them with impatience . " We 're going to wait till she gets nearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be close to the beach , and we wo n't have to drag the chain so far . " " You 'd better come now , " said Phil . " No , " said Bart ; " the chain wo n't reach so far . " " All right , " said Tom . " We 'll go up the bank again till you 're ready . " Saying this , the two boys clambered up the bank , when they rambled a little into the woods . Arthur and Bart then found a line , one end of which they fastened to the anchor . It was their intention to take the line ashore , and let go the whole chain , which they hoped could be pulled to the beach as far as the tree . Before that could be done , how ever , it would be necessary for the schooner to be much nearer . The water was already rising , and there yet remained many feet to be covered before the tide would reach what they considered as highwater mark . /z/ " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour yet . It will be an hour later than we calculated , " said Bruce . " Hang it , it 's too cold here . I wish we had our clothes . " " Well , I 'm not going to freeze any longer , " said Bart , jumping down into the hold . He was absent for a few minutes , and soon returned with a quilt gracefully wrapped around him like a Roman toga . With a laugh , Arthur and Bruce jumped down , and imitated his example . Then coming on deck again , they joined Bart , and the boys professed to be very comfortable , considering all things . They now took their seats at the stern , and looked out to sea , watching for any signs of relief . This occupied them for a longer time than they thought . " I wonder what 's become of Tom and Phil , " said Arthur , suddenly jumping up and looking toward the shore . The others did the same . Scarcely had they done so , when a cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred yards away . Phil and Tom were scrambling down the bank , gesticulating wildly . " What 's all this ? " cried Arthur . For a moment no one answered ; but at last Bart said , in a voice tremulous with agitation , i : We 've mistaken the high-water mark al together , boys . It must have been high tide /z/ when we came on board . We 've been drifting off ever since . " " Could n't we wade ashore ? " said Arthur . Bruce seized a boat-hook , and plunged it over the vessel 's side into the water . " Could n't do it , " he said , slowly . " There are eight or nine feet of water . " " Ca n't we swim ? " " Will you try it ? " Each one looked at the other , but there was no assent to this . It was not the mere distance , but the other perils of the deep that deterred them , and more than all , the remembrance of their last panic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy Shore . The Fisherman 's Boat . Reappearance of old Friends . Remonstrances , Explanations , and Confessions . EANWHILE ; even while they were speak ing , every moment drew them farther away from the shore . They saw Tom and Phil standing on the beach , which they had reached by this time , and waving their hands with frantic gesticulations . They heard them . shout , " Come back ! You 're adrift ! " and other words not in telligible . They shouted back again to encourage them , though they , themselves had but little hope . " We have n't any anchor , boys , " said Bart ; " but let 's put down what we have . It may hold , or , at least , prevent our drifting so fast . " " Well , there 's nothing else to be done , ' - ' said Bruce ; " so I suppose - we may as well try it . Come alone , boys . We must do what we can . " o / / Saying this , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the anchor was let go . They waited a little while to see what effect this /z/ would have , but in a few moments saw that very little was produced . " No go/ ' said Bruce . " Suppose we give her the whole chain . " " Yes/ ' said Bart . " It may hold her if it is all out , " " At any rate , " said Arthur , " it will prevent her drifting somewhat . " " Down she goes , then , " said Bruce , as the chain ran out . Soon it was out at its fullest extent , and they again watched to see what effect would be produced . By this time they had gone very much farther from the shore , and Tom and Phil were just discernible . " It checks her a little , " said Bart , " yet very little . As to holding her , that is out of the ques tion . " " And yet there ca n't be much of a current here . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell anything about it . There are currents in all sorts of places around the bay . " " Perhaps , if we let it drag for a while , " said Bruce , " it may catch somewhere and hold . I 've heard , of such things . " " There 's very little chance , I 'm afraid , " said Bart , in a despondent tone . " If wo only had half a fluke I would n't care ; but . as it is , we have no fluke at all , and that 's why we ca n't do any thing . " /z/ Waiting thus , and wondering what they could do next , the three boys looked sadly toward the receding shore . The quilts which they had thrown around them had been fastened at the waist with rope-yarns , and these , in the exercise of letting go the anchor , had fallen from their shoulders , leaving them exposed from their waists upward . They looked ruefully at one another as they thought of this , burst out laughing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shoulders again . " It was bad enough this morning/ ' said Arthur , at last , " but it was a joke to this . What can we do for something to eat ? " " There 's not a morsel on board . " " The last mouthful of bread we ate before we waded ashore . " " If we only had a fish-hook we might hope to catch something . " " Fish-hook ! Why , man , we have n't any kind of bait . " " Well , all we 've got to do is to hope for some one to pick us up . " " Is that all ? No , " said Bart . " I , for one , am not going to sit down and float away , goodness knows where . I move that we up sail and go somewhere . " . " Up sail ! " " Of course . Why not ? " " But can we can you ? " " 0 , we can scrape along . I 'd rather have a /z/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . You all understand my knowledge of sailing , for you 've had a fair specimen of it , and if you 're willing to risk my steering again , I 'm ready to take hold ; if not , then you or Bruce take hold , and I 'll keep at the sails . It do n't make any dif ference , though , which of us is captain , for I sup pose one knows just as itmch as another . But , at any rate , I 'm bound to have the sails up . " " So am I , " cried Bruce , " whatever happens . " " And I too ! " cried Arthur . " Bart , you be captain , old fellow . We wo n't take your office from you . You 've had more ex perience than we have had , at any rate , for you 've steered her already . But we must get up the piece of an anchor first . " " Of course we must , and the sooner the better . " Upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was hard work , but after some time it was successfully accomplished . By this time they had drifted out several miles , and the beach still lay before them , but it was faint in the distance . The headland was then somewhat toward the right , and this- served as an excellent guide . The ves sel 's head was still turned toward the shore , in the way m which she had drifted out . " My idea , " said Bart , " is , that we sail straight back again . " " It 's a pity we Ijad n't the other fellows on /z/ oard , " said Bruce , " for we might try some place where there might be houses . " l Well , in that case , I 'd give you the helm , " said Bart . " As long as I 'm here , I will only go where I know my ground . I do n't care to try the Five Islands again , nor would I like to turn the schooner . It 's lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , boys , let 's hurry up with the sails , or else she may turn off in some other direction ; and then how we can get her round again , will be more than I can say . " Hoisting the sails was arduous work , but they succeeded . The wind had moderated , and the ves sel glided slowly back toward the beach . Bart was so anxious to rejoin Tom and Phil , that he did not venture to try any experiments in sailing , but simply kept the schooner 's head toward the place where he supposed they might be standing . The wind was favorable , the vessel drew nearer and nearer , and at last the beach again became dis tinctly visible. - A shout of joy escaped them as they recognized Phil and Tom again . " I wonder how they felt when they saw us drifting , " said Bruce . " They must have given us up for lost . " " I wonder whether they expected that we would raise the sails . " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprising , after all ; especially 240 THE B. o. w. c. as we did n't think of it ourselves till the last moment . " " That 's odd , too . It seems now as though it ought to have been the very first thing to think of . " " Well , the fact is , we had such a tough time this morning off that headland , " said Bart , pointing to the dark rocks which were full before them on their right , " that it 's no wonder if we gave up all ideas of ever hoisting sail again . However , it 's all right . And now what ought we to do ? " " There 's only one thing that we can do . " " What 's that ? " " What ? - Why , what else can we do but run ashore , just as we did before . " " I suppose we ca n't do anything else ; but it 's a pity , too . Still we must take Tom and Phil . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least find a better part of the coast . This is so remote , and I have n't seen any houses near the place at all . " Bad as it was , there was no help for it ; and so Bart had to keep the schooner straight on . On account of the currents , however , and the loss of way , the Antelope could not come within a mile of her former landing-place . Phil and Tom saw this , and ran down the beach , carrying the bundles ; and just as they came opposite to their companions , the Antelope grounded about a hundred . ' feet from the beach . Without waiting another instant , Phil /z/ and Tom threw off their clothes , and waded out . They got on board without any adventures , and celebrated the restoration of their companions by dancing like wild creatures about the deck . Long explanations followed from both sides , after which they discussed their future prospects . " Hallo ! " said Arthur , as the schooner sank a little on one side . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tide . And now what can we do , or where can we fasten her ? " " We 'll have to try and use the chain and line , as we did before . " " I wonder if we are not too far out . " " No ; I think not , " said ? hil . " There 's a good stump up there to fasten a line to , " said Tom . " I dare say we can get a line up . If not , we can bury the anchor in the mud , and put stones over it . " " And what can we do about exploring the country ? " " Some of us must stay by the schooner to attend to the fastenings . " " Two can stay , and three go . " " No , three had better stay , and two go . It 's too hard work . " " Pooh ! two will be enough . But who will they be ? " " Well , we must toss up for it . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once . There 's no time to lose . " " Suppose , before we do anything more , " said Bart , " that we all slip ashore and put our clothes on . For my part , I 'm chilly ; and though I could easily get some more quilts , yet it seems unneces sary to do so when I have my own clothes so near . Besides , here are Phil and Tom , whose teeth are ' already chattering . " A loud laugh followed ; after which they all sprang , one after the other , into the water , and hurried to the shore . There they dressed them selves ; and as the vessel was fairly aground , with the tide rapidly going out past her , they threw themselves on the beach , and prepared to decide on the ones that would stay behind . " There ! " cried Phil , suddenly springing to his feet . " I knew it was ! " " What ? what ? " exclaimed all the others . " A sail ! out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Bart . " Phil , you 've got a good pair of eyes in your head . " " It 's a sail-boat , " said Bruce . " And heading this way , " said Bart . " Hurrah ! " cried Tom . " They 've come for us at last . " " Come , now , boys , " said Arthur , " do n't let us get excited again . I tell you that boat is some fisherman , and it is passing by here . Those on board won't* see us , and there 's no use doing any- /z/ ling . Let 's sit down and finish the toss-up , and send Phil to the top of the bank to watch , and make what signals he can . " " Not a bit of it ! " cried Bart ; and springing for ward , he dashed into the water toward the schooner with his clothes on . The water had fallen so far , however , that he did not get wet much above his knees . Clambering on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . W. C. , " which had waved there through all their vicissitudes , and tearing off his red flannel shirt , he fastened it close beneath the flag . Then he pulled it up ; and then kept lowering and hoisting , with the utmost rapidity , the extraordinary signal . Nor was this all . He had not yet lost confidence in his pistol , in spite of its signal failure in the case of the schooner some time before , but drew it forth now with a certain solemn decision . By this time all the others had come on board , and were waving all sorts of quilts and blankets from the stern . In the midst of all this agitation Bart fired his pistol . The smart pop ! rang out bravely enough ; but as the sail-boat was at least three miles away , it can not be said to have produced any very extraor dinary result . Bart , however , was satisfied . He had already given charge of the " ensign " to Tom , and , standing on the starboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a while , and waited for the boat to come nearer . Nearer she was certainly coming , in spite of the /z/ scepticism of Arthur . To guard against the pain of disappointment , Arthur was trying , with all his might , not to hope , and to prevent any of the others from hoping . Yet he could not help being as san guine as the others , in spite of his efforts . " Boys , " he cried , " be careful now . Remember this boat do n't see us , and do n't intend to . She 's . a fishing-boat , out after sturgeon . She 's sailing straight across , past us , to Hurrah ! here she comes straight down to us . " " Ha , ha , ha ! Hurrah ! She sees us ! Up and down with the flag , Tom ! Fire away , Bart 1 Bring up that fog-horn , somebody , and blow till you burst . I 'll content myself With a sociable yell . " Whereupon a yell , so loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Bruce , that it seemed to penetrate even to the boat . White signals cer tainly were waving from those on board , and a tall figure in black stood upright in the bows waving a hat . " Ha , ha ! " cried Bart , as he fired his pistol again , and danced joyously about . " And you call that a fishing-boat , do you , Arthur ? So you think the fishermen here go out to throw their nets , dressed in black broadcloth and silk hats , do you ? Well , I call that good . A fisherman ! Who would think of Mr. Long being taken for a fisherman ! " All was now the wildest joy . There was no more doubt , and no longer any mistakes . The /z/ boat saw them , and had returned answer to their signals . It was bearing swiftly down toward them . It was filled with people . Who were they all ? The question was soon answered . Nearer came the boat , and nearer , and still nearer . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel 's quarter . Mr. Long was first on board , wringing all the boys ' hands , and pretending to scold them . After him came Mr. Simmons , then Bogud , then Billymack , then the two captains . Hearty was the greeting , and deep and fervent the joy , at finding that all had turned out so well . The " B. 0 . W. C. " Bad to tell all about their adventures . They concealed nothing whatever . Bart related , with the utmost frankness , the story of his naviga tion experiments , interrupted by the laughter of the other boys , and the criticisms of Captain Cor bet , who would insist on explaining what ought to have been done . Then followed the story of the " shovel-mouth shark , " which produced an im mense sensation . Captain Corbet shook his head solemnly at the sight of the jaws , which Phil had run ashore to get . But their last adventure , when they were drifted away from their clothes , was considered about the most singular of all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " asked Bart , as he ended his story . Mr. Long related all about his first discovery of their accident up to the time that he had left with his party for the " pint . " /z/ " When we got there , " continued he , " we saw a schooner sailing , and made it out with the glass to be the Antelope . We watched you as you sailed toward the Five Islands . You must have been on your second tack then . We could not imagine where you were going . Captain Corbet thought you did n't know your way . I thought you were letting the vessel go wherever the wind might take you . As it happens , I was not very far " wrong . " At last we saw you turn , and the performance of the schooner showed us all very plainly that you could n't sail her . It filled us with the deepest anxiety . We could have got a boat , but your course was so strange , that we delayed until we could see where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any accident exactly , but hoped that you would come nearer . At last you sailed so close to that headland that we thought you were lost . Immediately afterward you passed behind it from sight . We waited some time to see if you would reappear , but you did not . So we at once put off in the boat which belonged to a fisherman who lived near , and came here as fast as possible . The last time that you drifted off we saw you ; but perhaps you were too excited to see us or per haps we were too far off to be seen very easily . " And now , " concluded Mr. Long , " I 've found you again , and it 's my fixed determination not to let any of you go out of my sight . You 're all a set of Jonahs . The only comfort is , that you come out all right at last . " /z/ " I 'm sure , Mr. Long , " remonstrated Bart , " you ought n't to blame us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not drift away if I could help it . I do n't enjoy going about in the fog , or among these tides . I 'm sure Bruce do n't . ' Neither does Ar thur , nor Torn , nor Phil . " " Blame you ? Of course I do n't blame you , " said Mr. Long . " How can I ? It was n't your fault , of course . I only mean that your fortunes have been very peculiar . I do n't know but , if I believed in omens , I 'd say that your black flag up there has brought us all this run of bad luck . But come , we 've been thoughtful about you . " We knew you 'd be starving , and so we brought along with us something for you to eat . " " Starving ! Mr. Long , we 're in that condition that we could eat horseshoes . " With a good-natured laugh , Mr. Long turned away , and jumping into the boat , handed up the eatables that he had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Sport . Back Home . Frightful Tale of Poison . A Visit to the Afflicted . eatables which Mr. Long had brought with him were - not such as would have been welcome to a fastidious taste or a dainty ap petite ; but to these long-fasting , hard-working , and half-starving , and altogether ravenous boys , any thing that was eatable was precious . The brown ship-bread and salt pork , which Mr. Long handed up to them , were seized as eagerly as if they had been roast beef and plum pudding , and soon dis posed of . A knife drawn from Phil 's belt served very quickly to cut the pork into slices , after which the pork and the brown biscuit vanished . " What . a pity , " said Mr. Long , as he looked around , " that we did n't get here an hour earlier ! The water 's going out fast ; the schooner is aground , and we 'll have to wait till the next tide before we can start for the cove . " " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as not to throw our time away , " said Mr. Simmons . /z/ " There do n't seem to be much prospect of doing anything just here , but we can try . " " Nor do I see that there are any people living about here . " " No : Captain Corbet told me there were no in habitants within eight miles . " " These banks are not very inviting to a min eralogist are they ? " said Mr. Simmons , with a sigh , as he looked along the beach . " No ; we 'll have to lay out our strength on the mud flats . Perhaps we may find some interesting footprints at low tide . " " Well , we may as well go ashore now , I sup pose . It 's rather monotonous standing here on an inclined plane , with the vessel aground on her side . I think I 'll climb the bank , and take a general view of the country . " " Very well ; I 'll go with you , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued , " remember this : do n't go out of sight . This beach is long , and it will soon be wide , for the tide will leave it all un covered . This will give space enough for even such extensive and wide-spreading desires as yours . Now , do n't go off the beach or the flats . Do n't go up in the woods , and get lost ; do n't go into the water , and get drowned ; do n't blow your selves up with that pistol ; do n't get into any more fights with ' shovel-mouth sharks , ' or , if you do , be sure to call me ; do n't get into air-holes if you can help it . As to going adrift again , I do n't /z/ see how you can manage that , as there is nothing afloat just yet ; but , dear boys , if you can possibly help it , do n't do it . Try and see if you ca n't man age to keep your clothes on . It 's much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " All this the boys greeted with loud laughter ; after which they sprang over the vessel 's side , and scattered themselves along the beach . Captain Corbet stood looking after them , with a beaming smile irradiating his venerable counte nance . " Yes , " he ejaculated , standing near Mr. Long . " Yes , sir ; I allus knowed it , an ' I always said it , that them there boys would turn up all right . Lor ' bless your heart , you ca n't wreck ' em , an ' you ca n't drown ' em . The fish does n't swim that can tetch ' em . They 're allus bound to turn up all straight . That 's the confidin ' belief that reigned in my boosom , an ' sustained me when we watched , ' em in the Antelope , up there at the pint . As to that there anchor , ef it had been a bran new one , it would have been broken off jest the same , for that there schooner was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there boys was bound to have that there adventoor . " Mr. Long now landed Vith Mr. Simmons , and went up to the top of the bank , where they sat down for some time , gazing upon the wide-spread scenery of the Basin of Minas . After this they descended and walked about the beach . At first , /z/ they hoped to obtain some shells ; but nothing of the kind could be found . In fact , there were scarcely any pebbles ; indeed , none but the most common kind . For all the waters of the Bay of Fundy and its adjacent harbors are singularly bare of the more delicate shell-fish . Lobsters abound , and so do clams ; so also do many kinds of seaweed ; but as for the more exquisite forms of sea life , such as we love to put in the aquarium , they must be sought for elsewhere . Here ' are swift currents , fierce rapids , strong tides , vast mud flats or sand flats , rivers that empty and fill themselves with every ebb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may look for those graceful , yet fragile creatures , whose abode is amid stiller scenes . As the tide went down , Messrs . Simmons and Long walked over the flats , hoping to find some thing which would reward their trouble . From the surface of the sea bottom thus uncovered , many interesting things might be obtained . On these mud flats are found many marks , which are the counterparts of others that have been turned into stone , and buried in the adjacent earth . Here may be seen the patter of rain-drops , and the foot prints of birds or beasts made on the very day of their discovery , while among the strata of the neighboring shore there may lie traces of a similar kind made many ages ago , which thus have been graven on the rock , and treasured up for our eyes . /z/ The boys dispersed themselves everywhere , ex tending their wanderings as the tide left more and more of the shore exposed . Far down they could see the weirs , placed there by the fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that they might visit . them , and inspect their contents . But it grew later and later , and finally it became too dark to do anything . Then the voice of Mr. Long was heard summoning them to the shore . * Thus the remainder of the day passed without anything to reward them , except the general ex citement which had been produced among them . It would be many hours yet before they could get afloat , and they amused themselves by making fires at the foot of the bank . A modest and frugal re past of brown biscuit and pork , washed down with cold water , concluded the day . For some time longer they sat round the fire , until , at last , ex cessive weariness overcame them . Then they went on board the schooner , and retired to bed . Some time after midnight the Antelope w ? afloat again . None of her passengers waked . She moved away from the shore without accident . Morning came , and she had not yet reached hei destination . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that tide . As she could not anchor , Captain Corbet had run her ashore . They had wait patiently , and get off at midday , with the rising tide ; after which they resumed their voy- /z/ age , and in three hours more they were in Cap tain Pratt 's house . Of the five boys who had been left behind , one was not visible , and the other four met them with pale , woe-begone faces . They showed no joy at seeing the return of the wanderers ; no curiosity to learn what they had been doing ; and even the sight of the jaw of the " shovel-mouth shark " pro duced upon them no effect whatever . It was seen that something had happened , and the unhappy four were closely cross-questioned . At first they refused to answer . At last , on be ing pressed , they confessed that they had all been poisoned . " Poisoned I. " cried Bart , in horror . " How was that ? " " Clams ! ! 1 " said Jiggins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clams ? " cried Bart . " What rubbish 1 How could clams poison you ! Pooh ! " " Ah , you do n't know , " said Jiggins . " You ask Mrs. Pratt . Have n't you heard the old saying , " he continued , with an air of peculiar solemnity ; " the old saying , that they have about these shores : " ' In the months without the " R , " Clams and oysters poison are ' ? " " Never heard it , " said Bart ; " and I do n't be lieve it . I 've eaten lots of oysters in May myself . " Jiggins shook his head . /z/ " Never do it again , " said he . " Do you mean to say that it was clams that up set you so ? " " Clams , and clams alone , " said Jiggins . " We owe our lives to Mrs. Pratt . She 's been a mother to us . " " Why ! What do you mean ? " " You see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fell down in horrible agonies . The torments which he suffered were so excruciating that he had to be carried to the house , and went nearly mad with pain . Mrs. Pratt attended him , and as soon as he was easier she took us in hand . We had eaten after Pat , and our pains had not yet be gun . Mrs. Pratt got out all her medicines , and tried them on us one after the other . " " What ! not all ! not all her medicines ! " " Yes , all ! " said Jiggins , in a dismal voice . " I ca n't tell you all that we took ; but first there was opodeldoc , then ginger , then Crabb 's cordial , then magnesia , then paregoric , then blue pills , then a mustard plaster , after which there was rum and onions , brimstone and molasses " " Stop , stop ! " cried Bart , " What 's all that ? You do n't mean to say that you took all that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow ing at once longer and paler at the recollection of Iris sorrows . " And you 're alive yet all of you ? Then you need never be afraid of poisons . Yes , my poor /z/ Jiggins , you have been poisoned ; that 's a fact , though not by clams . " Mr. Long , who was present , had listened to all lis in consternation . " And where 's Pat ? " he asked . That young gentleman 's name was Michael , but everybody called him Pat , and so did Mr. Long . " And where 's Pat ? " " In bed yet , sir . " " Poor Pat ! Has he been dosed , too ? " " Yes , sir ; but he was taken worse than any of us ; " and with this Jiggins went on to tell all about Pat and the raw clams . " Dear , dear , dear ! " cried Mr. Long . " He must have eaten a bushel , and all raw . Dear , dear , dear ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how is it possible for me to keep you all out of mischief ? I go after one half of you who are in peril , and ' come back to find the rest of you half poisoned . But poor Pat where is he ? I must see him , for we have to start for home to-night . " " I 'll show you , sir , " said Jiggins ; and he took him to the room where Pat was . He was lying in bed , looking pale and exhausted . He greeted Mr. Long with a faint smile , and the kind-hearted teacher did nis utmost to soothe the afflicted boy . /z/ Complaints of a disappointed Savant . The Ji umble Confession of Pat . A buried Treasure , and a great Search after it by Torchlight . T , " said Mr. Long , kindly , " do you think you will be able to start to-night ? " " To-night , sir ? " said Pat , dolefully . " Yes , the recess is over . Our time is up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have been there Saturday night . Do you think you can come ? " " I suppose I 'll have to , sir . " " If you 're too weak , or if it pains you to walk , we can carry you down , you know . " " What time are ye afthcr lavin ' at , sir ? " " About one o'clock . " " 0 , thin , surely I 'll be betther by that time , " said Pat . " I 'll get a wink of sleep , and wake up mcself again . " " Do so , Pat . Is there anything I could get you ? " " No , sir , thank ye kindly . I do n't know of any thing . " /z/ Yes , they had to go back , for their time was up ; yet Mr. Long was in despair , not knowing what to do about the minerals . He was confident that they were somewhere but where ? No one knew , and , he could n't imagine . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation grew irrepressible . " It 's too bad . Our expedition has been ill organized . I do n't blame anybody , but we 've certainly had very bad luck . With only a week we have wasted or lost every day but one . Last Monday we were kept all day and all night at the wharf . " " Wai , Mr. Long , " said Captain Corbet , " I s'pose you 're kind o ' blamin ' me ; but what could I do ? Ef a man has a babby , must n't he nuss it ? " " No , he mus n't , " said Mr. Long ; " he must make his wife attend to household matters , and keep his engagements . " Captain Corbet stared with a look of horror and astonishment at Mr. Long . " Wai , sir , " he said , with modest firmness , " in my humble opinion , sir , a babby is a babby , an ' flesh an ' blood is flesh an ' blood ; an ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that there bab by , sir , " he continued , warming up in a glow of fond parental feeling , " ef you 'd a-seen that there babby , as I 've seen him , a crowin ' , an ' a pullin ' of my bar , an ' a sayin ' , Ga-ga-ga , - you 'd " Mr. Simmons , " said Mr. Long , suddenly , " have you hunted for the stones ? " /z/ " O , yes , everywhere . " " And did you find nothing ? " " Nothing . " " There it is , " resumed Mr. Long . " A whole week worse than lost . We lost Monday . We started Tuesday , and sailed riearly all day . We had about two hours ' work , and then the boat went adrift . All Wednesday we were wandering about the- bay . Thursday came , and we did n't find the boys till the day was well gone , and then stopping at O'Rafferty 's and coming here took up the remainder of the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mr. Simmons , with a pleasant smile . He was an amia ble man , and always looked on the bright side of things . " Yes , we had , " said Mr. Long , " but unfortu nately we accomplished nothing . We had a long journey , and came back empty-handed . " " At any rate , we had the time . " " But that time was lost . " . " 0 , well , " said Mr. Simmons , " it was one of those days which everybody must expect to have . We tried hard , but were unsuccessful . I do n't , by any means , , call such a day lost . We gave our selves up thoroughly to science . " " Well , call it a well-spent day , " said Mr. Long , " and what of it ? We will count it in ; but after that what ? Saturday came , and we had to go after the boys again ; now our time 's up , and /z/ to-night we must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of it we have been able to spend , at the very utmost , only one day and two hours . Well . I do n't know how it strikes you , but I call it hard . " " It would , indeed , have been hard if things had irned out as we feared , " said Mr. Simmons . " 0 , of course I feel all that . I am only lament ing that these accidents should have happened , and that , when we came for a certain purpose , we should have been unable to carry it out . And see how things have gone on . We are out of provis ions , and have to lay in a stock of meal , and molas ses , and pork . " " I 'm - sure , meal makes very good food , " said Mr. Simmons . " Hot corn-cake is rather a delicacy , and molasses is very good to eat with it . " " After all , I do n't care anything about these things , " continued Mr. Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the minerals . " " 0 , they 're not lost . " " Yes , they are . No one knows anything about them . No one has seen them . No one can find them . They 're lost , Mr. Simmons , beyond the pos sibility of redemption . " " 0 , I hope not . " " Well , I 'm going to make a final search . Cap tain Pratt has asked every man , woman , and child in the place , but no one knows anything about them . . I 'm now going to question every one over /z/ again . I 've asked Captain Corbet already . He knows nothing . Captain Corbet , where 's the mate ? " " Sound asleep in the barn , sir . " " Then I 'll go out and ask him . " Captain Corbet went out with him , and after much trouble they roused the sleeper , who , how ever , could tell them nothing whatever about the stones . Then Mr. Long asked all the boys in succession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was deter mined to try it again . There was no result . No one knew anything about it . At last , all had een examined but Pat . Mr. Long felt sorry for him , and would have left him untroubled ; but his in tense desire to investigate thoroughly was too strong , and ' so he resolved to ask him . Pat was trying to get some sleep , and with very little success . Mr. Long asked him kindly about his feelings , and spoke cheerfully to him for a few moments . At length he asked him , " Pat , I had two baskets of specimens , and they 've been lost . Do you know anything about them ? " " Two baskets of what , sir ? " " Specimens . " " Spicimins , sir ? " " Yes . " " What are spicimins , sir ? " " Why , mineralogical specimens . Minerals , you know. * ' /z/ " Minerals ? Sorra a one o ' me knows what that same is , sir . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mineral ? Nonsense ! What wo were gathering on the island " Gatherm ' ? Was it minerals , then ? " said Pat . " Is it any thin ' like o ' like shrimps , sir ? " Mr. Long laughed . He knew Pat 's wonderful ignorance about some things , but he was hardly prepared for this . As for . Pat , the poor fellow found he had made a mistake , and colored violently from shame and vexation . " Do you really mean to say that you do n't know what minerals are ? " asked Mr. Long . " corra a bit of it thin , sir . " " Well , they look like little stones . Did n't you Bee us breaking little pieces from the rocks ? " " I did n't notice , sir . " " That 's no way to do , Pat . You ought to keep your eyes open , or you 'll never learn anything . " " " Yes , sir . " " Well , then , these minerals looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Each one was carefully wrapped in paper . Now those two baskets of stones are missing , and I ca n't find out anything about them . I want you to try and remember if you 've seen anything of that kind , or if you 've seen any little bits of paper that may have been around them . Do you understand ? Little stones , you know . " And Mr. Long smiled encouragingly , SQ &a; to give Pat a chance to collect his thoughts , /z/ " Little stones ? " faltered Pat , as there flashed over him an awful suspicion that he had done an irreparable mischief to somebody , and to Mr. Long in particular . " Little stones , sir ? " " Yes , Pat , little stones . Dirty little stones . You might have seen them , and would suppose that many of them were worthless , unless they were wrapped in paper and carefully packed . " " Dirty little stones , sir ? " said Pat , in an imbe cile way . " Yes , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ? " said Pat , whose voice died away into a mournful wail , while he cast an imploring glance at Mr. Long . " Yes . Tell me , " cried Mr. Long , " have you seen them ? " " I have , sir , " said Pat , dolefully . " When ? where ? Where are they now ? Where did you put them ? " " I I " He hesitated . " Quick ! It 's late . I want to get them . You brought them to the house , I suppose ; or did you put them on board of the vessel ? " /z/ " Well , why do n't you tell me what you did with them ? " " 0 , sir , it 's heart-broken I am this minute , sir ! It 's fairly dead wid grafe I am , sir ! You 'll niver forgive me ! an ' I 'm afraid to tell you , sir . " /z/ " What ? What 's all this ? What have you been doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " 0 , sir , I thought it was a trick , sir , that the boys played on me , sir ; and I pitched them over the mud into the bank , sir . " " You what ! " cried Mr. Long , in an awful voice . Hereupon Pat , with many sighs and tears , and entreaties for pardon , told him all . Mr. Long heard him through without a word . Then he asked mi nutely about the spot where they had been thrown . After this he rushed from the house down to the point . The . tide was down below that place , leav ing the mud flat uncovered . The sun was just setting . Mr. Long . stared wildly about . There was not a trace of a s'ingle specimen ; for the heavy stones had sunk in , and the soft ooze and slimy mud , closing over them , had shut them from sight . Mr. Long looked around in despair . He had hoped that he might recover some of them , but was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely . Besides , to add to his disap pointment , the sun set before he had begun any thing like a search ; and the shadows of evening came on rapidly . What was he to do ? Could he thus give up the results of his expedition , and consent to lose those precious specimens for which he had done so much ? The thought was intolerable . He would go back and interrogate Pat afresh . It was possible that Pat had directed /z/ him to the wrong place . It was scarcely possible that every stone could have vanished so completely , if this were really the place where Pat had thrown them . Such were Mr. Long 's thoughts and hopes , under the stimulus of which he at length retreated from the bank and returned to the house . Thus far he had kept Pat 's performance a secret , out of consid eration for Pat himself ; for he was not willing that so glaring a case of dense and utter ignorance should be made public . But now he was com pelled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get their assistance in the search ; so , after once more ques tioning Pat , and getting from him fresh particulars about the place where he had thrown the stones , and finding , to his dismay , that it was no other than the very place where he had been , he went to sum mon the rest of the boys . Gathering them together , Mr. Long began to unfold to them the fate of the long sought for , but still missing , stones . As he began , his native gen erosity made him desirous of sparing poor Pat ; but as he proceeded , the sense of his . own wrongs overcame the dictates of generosity . He concealed nothing , he kept back nothing , he palliated nothing . All was made known . Finally , he implored the assistance of every one of them in finding the lost treasures . Of course , after such an appeal , there was no chance for refusal ; and so they at once prepared /z/ to follow him . Bart insisted on procuring torches , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtaining light . This was by stripping the inflammable bark from the huge piles of birch firewood that lay near the house , and fold ing these up in compact scroll-like sticks . A large number of these were made ; and with these , with lanterns , and with pine knots , the whole band fol lowed Mr. Long to the bank . Here they took off their shoes and stockings , and prepared for their task . The mud on the surface was very soft to the depth of several inches , and into this they sank ; but sinking thus far , they found a hard clay bot tom . Proceeding in this way , they all sought with earnest scrutiny for signs of the buried stones . For some time nothing could be found . At last , with a cry of delight , Bogud plunged his hand into the mud , and drew out something , with which he instantly hurried to Mr. Long . " Here 's one of them ! " said he . He held out a lump , at which Mr. Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a small lump of mud or clay than anything else . So they all said . " Pooh 1 " said they ; " a little lump of clay . " " It 's not clay , " said Bogud ; " it 's the amethyst . I know it by the way it feels . It 's covered Avith mud , though , and ought to be washed immedi ately. " /z/ Saying this , he rubbed the clinging mud with his fingers , disclosing at last something with an oval surface and a dirty-gray color . " It 's the amethyst , " repeated Bogud , trium phantly . " I know it by the oval back . I picked the amethyst myself . Wait till I get the rest of the mucl off . See here ! but what hallo ! " His confident tones ceased , and changed to an exclamation ' of doubt , then disgust . The boys had crowded around to see the exhumed treasure , and to catch the secret of Bogud 's luck . As he held it forth and wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge , it stood revealed to all . " A clam ! a clam ! a clam ! " was the instanta neous shout , followed by a peal of laughter . In fact , so it proved . It was a clam-shell filled with mud which Bogud had drawn forth so trium phantly . After this they sought for some time longer . It was a striking scene . The boys without shoes , with their trousers drawn up above the knee , with their torches flashing through the shades of even ing , as they were waved overhead , with the flakes which fell every instant from the torches into the mud , with their laughter , and noise , and jesting , all formed a scene in the highest degree wild and picturesque . But the search was useless . Perhaps the find- /z/ ing of the clam disheartened them ; perhaps it was really not possible to find wfyat they sought . At any rate , after half an hour , even Mr. Long him self despaired , and called off all the boys to return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Off Home . A weary Way . Baffled like the Flying Dutchman . Cor bet pines for his Bally . " The Wind at last 1 Hurrah I " fT midnight the whole party left Captain Pratt 's , in order to make preparations for embarking in the Antelope , as soon as the tide would serve . Pat had regained very much of his former strength and spirits ; the pain had , in a great measure , left him , and the reaction from his misery exhibited itself in occasional peals of wild laughter , which broke very strangely upon the silence of the night . He was quite able to walk down , and joked with the other boys about his mishap . Trouble had been anticipated in getting him down to the vessel ; but the anticipations , which had proved baseless in regard to him , were more than realized in the case of the mate . This worthy had spent almost all the time in sleep ing on Captain Pratt 's haymow ; and now , when the time had come for departure , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten o'clock , /z/ Captain Corbet had called him , but with no result . Then he had used other modes of rousing him , which had all ended in a failure . Mr. Long had exerted himself , and with a like result . As a last resort , he had commissioned the boys to do what they could toward rousing the slumberer . They very willingly undertook the commission . Ran ging themselves round him , they kept up a pro longed shake at his shoulder , his head , and his feet . By this means they succeeded in rousing him so far that he would utter words in a dreary Way in answer to their cries . Get up ! Get up ! " " Ye-e-e-e-e-e-s , " was the reply , ending in a long enore . Get up ! Hi , hi , hi ! " " In a mi i i n't . " " Hallo ! Up ! Get up ! The schooner 's off ! " " Hey ? " " The schooner 's off ! " " Hm-m-m " " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep any more ( Get up ! " and amid loud cries and yells the recumbent form was shaken from head to foot . The mate gaped , and yawned , and blinked , and opened his eyes with a glassy , dreamy stare , dazzled by a candle-light , which flickered in his face , and confused by the uproar . He was like a bat suddenly plunging into a lighted parlor full of noisy children out of the midst of a /z/ dark night . Only he was n't quite so much awake as a bat might be . " My name 's Wade , " he ejaculated at last , in a slow and solemn tone . " Hi , hi , hi ! Yah , yah , yah ! Hi , yah ! h-o-o-o-o ! Get up ! " My ole ' oman 's name 's Gipson , " continued the mate , in a dreamy voice , as though amid his dreams he was still following out the one train of thought which seemed to engross his mind during his wak ing hours . " Ya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get up ! Hal-1-o-oo-o-o ! Bow-wow-wow ! Ba-a-a-a-a ! " and with yells and shouts like these , with cock-crows , with all the cries of a crowded barn-yard , the boys returned to their effort at rousing him . " An ' ye 'll not find many of that name in this country ! " said the mate , with a tone to which he seemed struggling to give a sleepy emphasis . Up rose the barn-yard cries again , mingled with yells , shrieks , bellowings , cat-calls , hoots , and roar " Come , come , " cried Bart , shaking his head vi lently . " Wo n't you get up ? " " No , sir ! " said the mate ; but whether it re ferred to his dream , or was intended as a reply to Bart , did not very clearly appear . The boys be gan to despair , and at length , after further endeav ors , they were compelled to give up . They ac cordingly returned to Mr. Long , and informed hi of their utter failure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well ! " said he , sternly , and with a dark frown . Ve-e-ry well ! I 'll see if I ca n't wake him this time . I 've been humbugged long enough ; and if words are of no use , I 'll have to try what virtue there is in cold water . " Saying this , he seized a pail , filled it at the well , and strode to the barn , followed by all the boys . Reaching the place , he advanced to the mate , and mercilessly emptied the entire contents full upon his head . That succeeded . With a gasp , a splutter , and a shriek , the mate started to his feet , looking wildly around as he tried to regain the breath which Mr. Long had so- rudely driven out of him . " What what what why , what d'ye mean ? " " I mean this , " cried Mr. Long , " that you 're wanted on board , and if you do n't go , I 'll empty the whole well on you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half re proachfully , and then , shaking the water out of his dripping locks , he slowly wended ' his way to the vessel . At last all were on board ; the baskets and boxes were in the hold , the lines were cast off , the sails were hoisted , and the Antelope dropped down the stream . Messrs . Simmons and Long retired , but most of the boys remained on deck for some time , /z/ singing , and laughing , and joking with each one about the peculiar mishaps which he might have incurred during the last eventful week . At length all retired , and silence reigned over the schooner and over the deep . Early in the morning all were up . The sea , far and wide , was as smooth as glasa , except where long lines , and occasional ripples , showed the meet ing of opposing currents . Above , the sky was cloudless , the sun was bright , and in the air not a breath of wind was stirring . Upon this Mr. Long looked with extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky . The schooner 's sails were flapprhg idly , her head was pointed toward the Five Islands , and Captain Corbet was standing listlessly at the helm . " Captain , what 's all this ? " asked Mr. Long . " The schooner is heading toward the Five Islands . Are we going back ? " " No , sir . The schooner 's not particular just now whar she heads . " " Why do n't you steer for Grand Prd ? " " Jest what I 'd like to do , if she 'd let me . " " Let you ? " " Yes . There ai n't a mite o ' wind , an ' she 's goin ' every which way . " " Then we 're standing still , and doing nothing . " " Standin ' still ? " cried Captain Corbet . " Lor ' bless you , a couple of hours ago we were ten milea up there ; " and he pointed far away toward tho other end of the bay . /z/ " Up there ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by no man ner o ' means . " " What are we doing ? " " Driftin ' . " " Drifting ? " " Y.es ; goin ' ahead like a race-horse head fust , tail fast , sideways , end on , and every kind o ' way that a floatin ' craft kin move . " " Where are we drifting to ? " " Down to Blomidon . " " Blomidon ! " cried Mr. Long , aghast . " Yes ; an ' farther too . It 'll be lucky if we do n't find ourselves out in the Bay of Fundy be fore long . " " But ca n't you do something ? Ca n't you sail for some harbor ? " " Jest what I 'm a pinin ' to do , on'y I ca n't come it , nohow . Ef I had a steam tug-boat I 'd clap a line on board her , an ' get into a place of refooge ; but bein ' as there is n't any , we 've got to drift . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cried Captain Corbet , in surprise . " Why , the anchor 's broke . " " Well , well , " said Mr. Long , in bitter vexation , " have n't you got something no sweeps ? " " Not a sweep , as I 'm a livin ' Corbet . " It was too true . There was no wind , and they were drifting at the mercy of the tide . The ves sel went every way , heading in no direction . They /z/ had no anchor , and they could not sail into the shore . They were completely helpless . By this time they had all hoped to be near their destina tion ; but it seemed , from appearances , that they were farther away than ever . What brought their situation home most forcibly to all , was the solemn fact that their provision was now limited to Indian meal and molasses , with a little salt pork . If Solomon had only been on board , it would not have been so bad , for the genius of the venerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as these a wonderful variety of palatable dishes . But Solo mon was far away , and the cooking was intrusted to the clumsy hands of the mate . His attempts were so deplorable that the boys were permitted to make experiments of their own in the lofty art of cookery . The consequence was , that they spent the whole morning in the cabin , and used up most of the molasses in making candy , which , though very badly burned , was still more agreeable than the burned paste of Indian meal which the mate laid before them as a breakfast . The hours of the morning passed , and neither anger , nor impatience , nor hunger could have any effect upon the relentless tides . The schooner calmly and placidly went drifting on , past Blomidon , past Cape Split ; and they would assuredly have drifted out into the Bay of Fundy , had they not , very fortunately , encountered a side cur- /z/ rent , which bore them into a bay by- Spencer 's Island . There they remained embayed till the turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and up the channel , on the way back into the Basin of Minas . They were so near the shore that Mr. Long de liberated seriously about landing , going on foot to Parrsboro ' village , and trying to get a row-boat to take them to Cornwallis , or taking the steamer to " Windsor , or doing something else equally desper ate . But Captain Corbet assured him that the steamer would not come for two days , and that he would be utterly unable to ge any men to row himso far . So he was compelled to stay by the schooner . Captain Corbet bore all this with admirable equanimity , looking with a mild concern at the impatience of Mr. Long , and regarding the boys with the indulgent smile of a superior being . Leaving the tiller to take care of itself , he min gled with them , and conversed freely with all . They drifted far up into the Basin of Minas , and looked forward to nothing better than a return to Blomidon and Cape Split , with , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the day passed , and night came . On the fol lowing morning they found themselves still in the Basin of Minas , not far from the Five Islands , and drifting toward Blomidon . " Wai/ ' said Captain Corbet , " I 've been a-thinkin ' /z/ that this here is just like the Flyin ' Dutchman . You 've heerd tell of him ; course . They say he 's a-sailin ' an ' a-beatin ' round the Cape of Good Hope , but ca n't never get round , nohow . That 's jest the pecooliarity of our position . Here we are , almost in sight of home , you may say , an ' still we have to go a-driftin ' an ' a-driftin ' , an ' I should n't wonder if we 'll get out into the Bay of Fundy to-day . If that happens , it would n't be a wonder if we were blown off to Bosting . " " Captain , " said Mr. Long , " I ca n't stand this . I must get ashore . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bruce Eawdon , and go ashore in the boat . I must go , for it 's a matter of the high est importance . Of course , it 's different with you . You would n't care if you drifted here till dooms day . " At this Captain Corbet thrust both hands deep into his trousers ' pockets , and regarded Mr. Long with a fixed gaze . " Me ? " said he , in a mild and almost parental tone . " Me not care ? me ! Look here , Mr. Long . Do you know what I am ? I 'm a parient ! Your books call you home , sir ; but what is it that 's a-callin ' o ' me ? My babby , sir ! That there tender infant has twined hisself round my boosom ; an ' what am I a-doin ' ? You do n't know , sir ; but I 'm a-yearnin ' an ' a-pyiin ' for my babby . He 's the most wonderful babby that I ever see , " continued the captain , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ crow ; and if you 'd jest hear him say his ga , ga , " 0 , bother your confounded baby ! " said Mr. Long , with brutal rudeness , turning away ab ruptly . Captain Corbet looked after him with a puzzled expression . At first , indignant surprise seemed to predominate , and those who stood near antici pated an outburst of long-restrained feeling . But it was only for a moment . Then Captain Corbet 's better angel came to his assistance . Indignation vanished , and the face that was turned toward Mr. Long had on it nothing but a meek , sad smile . Captain Corbet shook his head . " Thar , that 's it ; allus the same , " said he ; " onsympathetic , hard as a milestone , an ' owdacious in opposition to the tender babe . Human natur ' , " he continued , elevating his patriarchal head , and re garding Mr. Long 's back with a severe dignity , " human natur ' might exult in a administerin ' of a rebewk to sich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , boys . I 've sot at the feet of my babby . The aged Corbet has received insterruction from a mild infant . Now , I regard all that , " waving his hand toward Mr. Long , " not with anger , not with reperroach , no , but with kimpassion . I pity him . I feel sorry for him . To him is unknown the holiest feeling of the hewman boosum ; sich as / feel , sich as every feyther feels when he 's a-nussin ' of his peresshus babby. " /z/ Blomidon , insulted , avenges himself . A Victim devotes himself to appease his Wrath . Original Views of Captain Corbet with regard to the Ar chaeology and the Science of Navigation . schooner went on drifting , and drew near to Blomidon again . The giant cliff frowned darkly overhead , its sides all scarred and riven- by the tempests of centuries , its base worn by the fierce tides that never cease to sweep to and fro . Standing as it does , it forms one of the sublimest objects in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way more stupendous ; but Blomidon is so peculiar by its shape , its position , and its surroundings , that it stands monarch of the scene , and rises always with a certain regal majesty , seldom appearing without its diadem of clouds . All around are low lands , wide meadows , and quiet valleys , and the far spreading sea , into which this rugged height is boldly projected , terminating an abrupt rocky wall . From the shores , for many and many a mile around , wherever the eye may wander over the scenery , it rests upon this as the centre of the view . /z/ " Blomidon , " said Bart , " looks more magnificent ly than ever , and we have an excellent chance for a close inspection . " " I confess , " said Bruce , ' " that I would rather not have so good a chance just now . I 'd rather be near the mud flats of Cornwallis than this ma jestic cliff . " " It 's my opinion , " said Phil , " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How ? " " How ? Why , because we slighted him . We started with the intention of landing here , and instead of doing so we 've been almost everywhere but here . So now he has got us , and he will keep us . " ' " Well , if we only had something to eat , I would n't care . " " I ca n't eat pork . " " And I always hated Indian meal . " " And I 'm getting tired of molasses candy . " " Besides , I do n't believe that it 's healthy . " " And then , you know , it 's always burnt . " " But it certainly takes away one 's appetite . " " Yes , that 's a consideration . What would be come of us if our appetites were left ? " As they spoke , Mr. Long drew near . They were within a stone 's throw of the cliff , and were drifting slowly by . He looked up at the summit , as it towered far above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tempest-torn sides . /z/ " Boys/ ' said he , with a smile , " you 're right. * Blomidon feels his majesty to be slighted . He 's avenging himself on us . He 'll keep us here till he gets a victim , or at least till some apology is made . Now , I 'm going to appease his sullen majesty . " " How 's that , sir ? " " By offering up a victim . And who do you think it will be ? It will be myself . " " You , sir ! " " Yes . I 'm going to land . " " To land ! " " Yes . One of you can take me ashore , and leave me . I know the place well enough , and will walk to the nearest village . I can get a horse easily enough , and be home before sundown . " " Ca n't some of us go with you , sir ? " asked Bart , eagerly . " 0 , no . It 's better for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the walk will be too ' rough . For my part , I would n't go if I could help it . But I must go . My work demands my presence at once. - And then I really ca n't stand this any longer . I could , perhaps , endure the delay , but I can not stand Captain Corbet and his ehem ! his baby . " As he said this , he looked toward Captain Cor bet , who was out of hearing , and was standing dis coursing , with a pleasant smile , to Bogud and Jiggins . " Bruce , will you put me ashore ? " asked Mr. Long . /z/ " Certainly , sir , with the greatest pleasure . But I 'm very sorry that you 're going . " " I wish you 'd let all of us go , sir , " said Arthur . Mr. Long shook his head . " No , " he said . " You see it will be easy enough for one to get a horse to take him over , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go alone . I 've been there before , and I know my way . " " It will seem worse than ever when you go , sir , " said Bart . " 0 , you 'll have a wind before long . You wo n't be home as soon as I am , for the tide wo n't let you ; but , I dare say , you wo n't be much behind me . Take care of yourselves , and do n't try the boat again . " Saying this , Mr. Long went to Mr. Simmons , to announce his determination . That gentleman was much surprised , and endeavored to dissuade him . But Mr. Long was not to be dissuaded . Captain Corbet said nothing . He merely elevated his eye brows ; and there was that in his face which seemed to say , " There , I knew it . I 'm not at all surprised . I 'm sorry for him , but not surprised . He 's capable of any piece of wildness . He ca n't appreciate babbies . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All this his face fully ex pressed , but not a word of all this did Captain Cor bet say . Mr. Long shook hands with all the boys . Bruce was in the boat waiting , and soon he jumped in. /z/ The line was cast off , and Bruce sculled on over the smooth water without much difficulty . The tide was running rapidly , but there was plenty of coast before them ; it was not far away , and before long the boat had reached the beach . Mr. Long jumped out , and as his foot touched the shore , he gave a sigh of relief . " Ah ! " he exclaimed ; " here I am at last . " " Which way are you going , sir ? " asked Bruce . " Well , I 'll walk along the shore for two or three miles , and after that I can find my way to a road . " " You know your way I suppose , sir ? " asked Bruce , anxiously . " 0 , yes . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll make very good time if I do n't get at tracted by the minerals . That 's my only danger here . Good by . " He wrung Bruce 's hand , and walked off . Bruce then returned to the schooner , and reached it without difficulty . The boys on board watched Mr. Long for some time . The vessel was drifting down the strait , and he was walking along the shore in an opposite direction . They watched his black figure till he turned around a curve in the shore , and passed out of sight . For some time the vessel continued to drift under the same circumstances , without any signs of wind , or even the prospect of a friendly mud flat on which they could be quietly and comfortably stranded . This time they drifted below Spencer 's /z/ Island , and looked out into the Bay of Fundy with a vague fear of being borne away into its waters , and carried off for immeasurable distances . But the tide soon turned after they had reached this place ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from out the waters of the Bay of Fundy , yet they came no nearer to it . On the turn of the tide they drifted back once more . This gave them much relief , for as long as they were within the Basin of Minas it did not seem so bad . As they drifted along they came to the place where Mr. Long had landed , and they watched anxiously to see if there were any signs of him . They found none . " If we only had a glass , " said Bart . " Captain Corbet , have n't you a glass ? " " Yes a kind of a one . " " Where ? " " It 's in the cabin . " " May I have it ? " " 0 , yes . " Bart went down and looked for some time . At last he returned disappointed . " I ca n't find any glass , Captain Corbet , " said he . " Why , it 's jest in front of yer nose , " said Cap tain Corbet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . " Down went Bart after Captain Corbet , and . the latter pointed to the wall . " There , " said he . " I wonder you did n't see it . " /z/ " Where ? " asked Bart . " Where ? Why , there , " said Captain Corbet ; and saying this he put his horny finger on a small triangular fragment of what was once a lookingglass , which small triangular fragment was fastened to a post , on one side of the cabin , with brass trunk nails . " There it is , " said Captain Corbet . " You do n't seem to have any eyes in your head , though you 're sharp enough sometimes , gracious knows . " " That ! " cried Bart . " That ! Why , it 's a spy . glass I want . " " A sj9 ? /-glass ! 0 , yes . Wai , I hai n't got none . " . " You have n't any ! " " No ; never owned one in all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought every sea captain had to have one . " " Wai , no . There ai n't no great use for sich . They 're a kind o ' luxury , you see . I do n't have any call for them . There 's other machines , too , that they talk about , sech as quadrupeds an ' sextons ; but I never bother my head about ' em . " " Why , how do you manage to sail your schooner ? " " How ? Why , jest up sail an ' let her slide . " " But what do you do when you 're out of sight of land ? " " Never git out of sight . Ef I should , I 'd steer straight back for the land agin " /z/ " What do you do in the fog ? " asked Bart . " The fog ? I jest do the best I kin . Any ways , I do n't see what use a sexton would be in a fog , nor a quadruped nuther . Then them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun . So , you see , they 're no manner o ' use in these here waters , nor in no waters at all . People git along jest as well without ' em . Why , here am I , an ' I bin sailin ' this forty year , an ' never tetched a sexton nor a quad ruped ; and me bin all the way to Bosting . Be sides , did Noah make his vyge in the Ark with a quadruped ? No , sir . Did Solomon have one in the ship that he sailed to Ophir ? Agin I say , no , sir* So I conclude that what the prophets , an ' patriarchs , an ' - wise men of old , an ' a darn sight better men than sea captains are as they go these times , what they did without , we can do with out . " " But you have a compass ? " " Course I have . " " They did n't have a compass in those days . " " Yes , they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind . " " Excuse me , young sir , bein ' a man old enough , to be your feyther , an ' a seafarin ' man , too , an ' , what 's more , a man that reads his Bible , but they did . " " I should like to know how you make that out . " /z/ " Did you ever read Acts ? " " Of course . " " Did you ever happen to hear tell of the vygo of the ' postle Paul , young sir ? " " Yes ; but what 's that got to do with it ? You do n't mean to say that he had a compass . " " That 's the very pint that I 'm a drivin ' at . " " What ! that the apostle Paul had a compass ? " " Course he had . " " Why , the compass was n't known till the four teenth century . Flavio Gioja , of Amalfi , is the one that they say invented it . " " So that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it ? " said Captain Corbet , with a look that would have been one of seorn if it had n't been so full of pity . " So that 's wkat they . teach is it ? Wai ! wall wall If I ever ! I never did ! However , I 'll show you at once what 's the wuth , the terew wuth , of your larnin ' , when it 's put fair an ' square in opposition to facts . Look here now , an ' listen , an ' do n't forget . In the account of that vyge , it says distinctly , ' So we fetcheda compass . ' What have you %-ot to say to that , now ? hey ? " And Captain Corbet drew himself up , and watched the effect of this startling piece of in telligence . Upon Bart the effect was instantaneous , though not of the kind which Captain Corbet expected . A light broke in upon his mind , arid a smile burst /z/ forth , and spread like sunshine over his lately puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked away so as to take in the full flavor of what he considered so good a thing . " 0 , yes/ ' said he at last . " I see . I under stand . I never thought of that before . I must let the fellows know . I 'll tell them all at school , from Dr. Porter down to the smallest boy in the primary department . And I 'll let them all know that it was you that told me . They 've all got an idea that it was invented either by the Arabs , or the Greeks , - or the Italians ; but now they shall hear Captain Corbet 's theory . " " Yes do do , " said Captain Corbet , eagerly . " An ' tell them that / told you . Tell Dr. Porter . I 'd like to know what the doctor 's got to say . " " Say ! He 'll say nothing he 'll be dumb . But I must hurry up . It 's strange , too . I was sure you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came after us the time we were aground . " " So we had , but it wa n't mine . " " Whose was it ?

He 's among his native rocks . A ' man like that ; a man that 's a stranger to the charms /z/ of a gentle smilin ' babby ; a man that gets mad with others , who are nat'rally pinin ' for their absent- offspring such a man has a heart that is a rock , an ' had oughter make up his abode among rocks .

" All of- the boys at . school love Mr. Long dearly . " " That ai n't the pint , " said Captain Corbet . " The pint is , how does he feel about a babby ? Doos he yearn over ' em ? Doos he delight in their little pooty ways ? Doos he crow over ' em ? Doos he nuss ' em an ' dandle ' em ? I jedge of a man that way , an ' by them there signs ; an ' I call that , by a long chalk , the most entirely jodgematical way of readin ' an ' interpretatin ' hu man natur ' . Read by that light , Mr. Long ai n't a succumstance . He 's left us . I 'm glad . Let him wander among the rocks and stones of Blomidon /z/ With this , Captain Corbet turned away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on deck again , to spread among his companions Captain Corbet 's peculiar views on the subject of spy-glasses , sextants , quadrants , and compasses . /z/ These new theories created an immense sensa tion ; and whatever opinion there may have been had before about the captain 's seamanship , there was no question now as to the perfect originality of his views . /z/ xxri . Being jolly under creditable Circumstances . Songs , Medleys , Choruses , Cheers , Laughter , Speeches , Responses . The Mud again . Hard and fast . What 'll you do now , my Boy ? R. LONG had gone from their gaze com pletely , and could be seen no more . While trying to find him , the boys made conjec tures as to where ho might be . Giving up all idea of his being on the beach , they imagined him wend ing his solitary way far up the coast , or , perhaps , scaling the mighty cliff itself in some more acces sible place . Gradually the vessel drifted farther and farther away , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , boys , " said Bart , " this is getting to be monotonous . We 're like ferrymen , going forever between two points . " " Yes , or like the pendulum of a clock , vibrating always , backward and forward . " " One more night of drifting is before us . " " More meals of pork and molasses . " " Or burnt Indian paste . " /z/ " Or smoky molasses candy . " " The worst of it is , that we have nothing to amuse ourselves with . " " It 's a pity we could n't start some game . " " Bart , tell a story . " " A story ? " said Bark " Who could tell a story under such circumstances ? " " I do n't believe , " said Bruce , " that a calm was ever known to last so long in the Basin of Minas . Was it , captain ? " he added , appealing to Captain Corbet , who had just emerged from the cabin . " Wai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a calm in the month of May ; still , we do have ' em sometimes . " " I should rather think we had , " said Bart . " I 've known ' em last a week , " said Captain Cor bet , solemnly . " A week ? " " Yes , a huh 1 week ; but that was in July . Still , there 's no knowin ' . It may be in May this year . " " Then we 'll have to go ashore in the boat to morrow . I will . I 'll mutiny , and start off . " So spoke Bart , and the rest all declared that they would do the same . " 0 , we 'll have wind to-night , " said Captain Cor bet , in a tone of vague encouragement . " Yes , yes , we must have wind to-night , or before mornin ' . We 've had about calm enough . You feel anxious , no deoubt , all on ye , " he continued , with /z/ a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jedge what I must feel me , with , my babby .

" And he looked at the boys with that mild face of his , whereon was intermingled an expression partly made up of a father 's affection , and partly of tender enjoyment of his little cherub 's innocent ways . " And what does he mean by Borax ? " asked Bruce . " What does he mean ? Why , a'most everything . It 's a pet name he gives to me , you know .

" The first verse was as follows : /z/ " There was an olc nigger , and he sailed on the sea ; And he lived not far from the land ; And he had no wool on de top of his head , And a comb and a glass in his hand . /z/ " O , the sto-o-o-o-o-o-o-orroy winds , how they blow ! So take up de shubbel an ' de hoe , While we poor sailor-boys are climbin ' up aloft . He has gone whar de good niggers go ' gers go ' gers go He has gone whar de good niggers go . " This astonishing production was sung with un common energy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others went on singing ; and after a short time he returned with a piece of paper in his hand , and a triumphant smile on his face . " Hallo , Bart ! what have you got there ? " cried Bruce . " It 's an original song , " said Bart . " By whom ? " " Myself , " he replied , meekly . " Hurrah ! Go it ! Sing it ! Give it to us ! " ' ' All right ; but you must all join in the cho rus . " " Of course . What 's the tune ? " " @#@ Auld Lang Syne . ' " " Go ahead , then , young feller ! Propel ! Shoot away ! Eeady present fire ! ; Waiting for the noise to subside , Bart stood in the midst of them , and after the cries had ceased , he began : /z/ " Should Capting Corbet be forgot , A-sailin ' o'er the sea ! O , no ! when we get back to school , We 'll often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of he , my friends ; We 'll often think of he . O , yes ! when we get back to school , We 'll often think of he . " " What 's that ? " cried Captain Corbet , with a emile of pleasure wreathing his venerable face . " Why , it ai n't why , railly why , it is me , too 1 Why , railly ! An ' you made up all that ? Wai , now , I call that rale cute . I do , railly . On'y I do wish , sense you did take the trouble to make up that there , bein ' as your hand was in , I wish you 'd kinder added a line interriducin ' the babby . We like to be kind o ' onseparable . It seems kind of agin natur ' to separate us . " " All right . I 'll introduce anything , " said Bart . u Here , boys , I 'll give you another chorus . ' We 'll often think of he , my friends ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his schewner gay , Likewise his small ba-be-e-e-e-e . ' " This new impromptu chorus was sung with still greater enthusiasm . Captain Corbet was affected to tears . Emotion overpowered him . As soon as he could muster strength to speak , he exclaimed , /z/ " You 've onmanned me you have , railly . The mention of that blessed babby kind o ' took away all my strength . But I 'll reward you , boys . When we get back ; I 'll make you all come up , and intro duce you all to the babby himself , sometime when the old woman 's away , you know , " he added , mys teriously . " I will now occupy the time by continuing the hymn , " said Bart , solemnly . Whereupon he pro ceeded : " I love to go to Blomidon , Its beauty for to feel ; But I 'd prefer a better fare Than pork and Indian meal . /z/ " Than pork and Indian meal , my friends ; Than pork and Indian meal : O , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was sung earnestly and with very deep feel ing . The recollection of their melancholy condi tion caused a mild pathos to be infused into the tones of all . Some of them seemed to be shedding tears . At any rate , they held handkerchiefs to their eyes . The next verse : " I love to sail on Minas Bay , Its beauty for to see ; To hunt for clams among the sands , And put them into me. /z/ " And put them into me , my friends ; And put them into me . To hunt for clams among the sands , And put them into me . " The mild melancholy that characterized the last chorus here changed into a livelier note , expressive of greater cheerfulness . The next verse : " Pratt 's Cove it has the biggest clams That ever mortal saw ; But when we hunt for clams again , We must n't eat them raw . /z/ " We must n't eat them raw , my friends ; We must n't swallow them raw . O , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't eat them raw . " This was sung energetically , yet in a dignified manner . The chorus was intended to convey a wholesome piece of advice to those who might happen to be in need of it , Pat , for instance , and so it was sung with dignity ; at the same time , the energy with which it was rendered was admi rably adapted to enforce the advice and carry it home to the heart and conscience of the hearer . The next verse : " We 've got molasses for our food , It came from Tri-ni-dad ; And when to candy it is boiled , It really is n't bad . /z/ ClIOKUS . " It really is n't bad , my friends ; It is n't very bad . Molasses , boiled , to candy turns , And really is n't bad . " A greater degree of liveliness prevailed here at the celebration of the only eatable thing among the stores . There was an intention to do honor to the molasses , and honor was accordingly done . The next verse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers for all the crew , For Jiggins , Sammy , Muckle , Pat , And three for Johnny Blue ! /z/ " Three cheers for Johnny Blue , my friends , Three cheers for Johnny Blue , For Jiggins , Sammy , Muckle , Pat , And three for Johnny Blue ! " Immense enthusiasm . Surprise on the part of all the boys whose names were thus so unexpect edly " wedded to song . " Recovering from their surprise , each one jumped up , placed his hand on his heart , and acknowledged the compliment by a Jow bow ; after which the song was sung again ; after which there came more bows ; and it would have gone on thus , with alternate bowing and sing ing , till the present time , had not the boys them selves felt overpowered , and demanded another verse . /z/ The next verse : " Three cheers for all the boys on board ; For Corbet three times three ; And thirty more for the jolly black flag Of the ' B. O. W. C. ' ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends , The ' B. O. W. C. ' Ever so many more for the jolly black flag Of the B. O. W. C. ' ! " This last chorus was sung with a vehemence , an ardor , and an enthusiasm that are absolutely in describable . It included all , and identified all , in the most delicate manner , with the " B. 0 . W. C. " It was sung over and over , and over yet again , accompanied with any quantity of cheers for every thing under the sun . The special allusion to Cor bet , in the last verse , elicited a fresh display of emotion from that venerable and highly-impressible party . He did not say much , however . He merely went round among the boys , and shook hands most warmly with all of them , one by one . He asked each one about his father , his mother , his brothers and sisters , and his uncles and aunts . He asked their full names , their ages , and the number of their blood relations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which he . freely offered , at any time , to take any of them , or all of them , on a cruise anywhere , at a moment 's warning . Finally , he /z/ reiterated his offer to introduce his babby to them all . This formed a climax . Beyond this he could not go . And there , naturally and inevitably , his eloquent oration ended . So passed the time . And when you take into consideration the solemn fact that all this time they were drifting , that the sea was smooth , that there was n't a breath of wind , that there was no pros pect of getting home , or anywhere else , for that matter , you will come to the conclusion that these boys were jolly under creditable circum stances . And you will be right in that conclu sion ; for it was in the very face of calms , strong tides , empty larders , wanderings at sea , famine , and privations of all kinds , that these boys stood up and sang their song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jol lity or of idle sport . It was more . It was the song of the unconquered soul . It was a defiance hurled full in the face of Fortune . The evening passed . The shades of night came down . It was dark , and it grew darker . Until late , the sounds of song , of laughter , and of mer riment , came forth and resounded through the night . At length all was still . All on board had descended to their couches , and were wrapped in profound slumber . The boy who awaked first in the morning gave such a shout that all the others were roused at once . /z/ What was it ? What ! An instant told them all . Down through the hatchway there came a blast of wind strong and cool , and full of sea salt . Above , they could see the sail distended to its utmost , while higher up the clouds were scudding across the sky . Be low , the vessel was lying far over , as it yielded to the wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dash of waves against her bows , told all that she was moving swiftly through the water . They hurried up to the deck . Far around them was the blue sea , now tossing into white-capped waves . A fresh , strong wind was blowing over the water , and it was fair . On the right rose Blomidon from out the foam that gathered at its base ; on the left the water ex tended till it was lost in the distance amid the haze that hung over the low-lying shore . Behind them lay the Fivfi Islands , and all that water over which they had so long been drifting . The vessel was heading straight to Grand Pre " , and was tear ing her way through the water as she had never done before within the experience of any of her present passengers . Joy reigned supreme . Loud cheers and cries of delight burst forth . " Why , captain , " said Bart , " I began to think that the Antelope could n't sail at all . " " Ca n't she , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she 's got a wind dead fair like this . " /z/ " When 'll we get to Grand Pr6 ? " " Wai , that 's difficult to say , " said the captain , thoughtfully . " Why , you do n't mean to say that there is any danger of the wind stopping now , or changing ? " " 0 , no ; there 's no danger of that . " " Well , what is there ? " " Why , we ca n't get to the wharf . " " Why not ? " " It 'll be low tide when we get there . " ' ' Low tide ! " repeated Bart , in consternation " and how far will we be from the wharf ? " " 0 , miles ; and that is n't the worst of it . You 'll have the Cornwallis River between you and Grand Prd . " Bart said no more , but retired to convey this disheartening intelligence to his companions . They talked over it thoughtfully and with serious faces . The vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind was strong and fair , and blew with undiminishing power . Looking toward the shore , they could see that their progress was ex cellent . Nearer they came , and nearer , until at last they saw before them a vast extent of mud flats , beyond which lay a low ridge all green with verdure ; and they knew it as the dike of Grand Pre . Beyond this again ascended the hills , with the white village at the base , and on the slope the conspicuous form /z/ of the Academy , with its broad portico and lofty cupola . " Where are you going now , captain ? You ca n't anchor . Is there a port here to run the schooner into ? " " Nary port . " " What 'll you do ? Surely you wo n't drift off again ? " " Drift ? No , sir . " " How will you manage ? " " How ? Why , there 's only one thing to do ; and that is , to run her right straight in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked steadily forward , and gave the tiller a pull to starboard . The schooner turned slightly . The next instant it ran squarely upon the mud flat , and stuck there , hard and fast . /z/ A wild Undertaking . A Race for Life . TJie lost Boot . The Quicksands . Tlie Isle of Safety . The Mud Gulch . Crossing the Abyss of Hud . Bruce ' s Doldrum . Two forlorn Figures . Rapturous Welcome . Speech by the Grand Pan jandrum. they were on the mud flat . It was a situation in which the B. O. W. C. had been before , but experience had not made it any the more pleasant to them . " We 've done it before/ ' said Bruce , " and why should n't we do it again ? " " So I say , " remarked Arthur . " It 's a great deal farther , " said Phil , " but in my opinion it is n't half so bad as the other one . " " Of course it is n't , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 'll be able to jump out upon the mud , and not up to our necks in water , as we did the last time . " " And so we need n't prepare to fight with shovel-mouth sharks , " said Phil . " The fact is , " said Bart , " it 's going to be a /z/ difficult job , and harder than the last one , perhaps . We 've got a couple of miles to go , instead of so many hundred yards . We must face that fact be fore leaving . " " AVe know that very well , " said Phil . " You see there is Grand Pre Justin front of us . " " Yes . " " Well , we ca n't go there , because between us and that place is the Cornwallis River , which just now is an abyss of mud , with a strong stream run ning at the bottom . So we 'll have to make an angle , and go up there toward the right , and go in a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles to the grass land , and another one to the bridge . So we 'll have two miles of mud . " " I do n't believe the mud is any different from what we found in the other place . " " It may not be , " said Bruce , " yet there may be air-holes . We 've got so far to go that we may find almost anyUiing air-holes , quicksands , or anything else . Still , I do n't believe that we 'll meet with any . " " Well , let 's wait till the tide gets down to the bows , and then start , " said Tom . With this the boys prepared for their journey . These preparations consisted in nothing but get ting some stout sticks , which they made by split ting up a board , and smoothing each piece with a knife . After this they informed Mr. Simmons of their intention . He looked aghast , and then told them that they would get too muddy . /z/ At this they laughed , and said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voyage , and could n't be much worse . So Mr. Simmons looked at them from head to foot , and then at himself . By this he discovered that the boys were in a. comfortably muddy condition , and what was more , that he , Mr. Simmons , he himself , was decorated with many mud marks , which sadly marred the beauty of his black attire . This dis covery filled him with such horror that he hurried below , where the sound of a brush in violent exer cise showed the boys that he was trying to eradi cate the stains , so as to prepare himself for a sol emn entry into the village . He did not appear on deck again . Captain Corbet , however , on learning their pro posal , had much more to say about it . He listened with staring eyes , and then declared that they ah 1 were crazy . " Crazy ? Why , ye 're mad as March hares ! Do ye know that that there mud is full of air-holes , an ' inhospitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year . So air keows likewise . People shun it . Death lurks there . I would n't go there for all the gold in Californy There 's quicksands , and there 's air-pots , and there 's holes of ah 1 kinds , there 's deep gulps that you ca n't cross no how . " " But did you ever hear of an accident ? " " Course I have . My feyther told me onst about neighbor of his'n that lost a friend down here-/z/ abouts . He was found next day lying on the shore up there thrown up by the tide . Besides , my wife 's ma told me of people that 's been a-missin ' , an ' what it 's strongly suspected that they kind o ' strayed down here , and got drownded . What d'ye say to that ? " " 0 , it 's all the same . There are five of us . " We 'll help one another . " " Ah , ye 'll help one another ! Yes , but to sartin ruination . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more anxious , a hundred times , to get ashore than you be . I 'm a feyther . I 've got a pinin ' babby that I 'm a-yearnin ' after . I 've got a kind of homesick feelin ' , that never leaves me , after him ; ' ee bessed chicken , so it was ! But do I go an ' resk my life ? Do I throw myself away ? Do I walk over quicksands , an ' air-holes , an ' mud gullies ? Not I. I stand here like a man , an ' wait . " " All right , captain ; we 'll tell them you 're cornin ' , " said Bart , stepping to the bows . By this time the tide had lowered , so that they could get out from the vessel on the mud . One by one they descended . They found the mud soft , of course , but not very much so . " 0 , boys , " cried Captain Corbet , " come back ! " " All right ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand , we 'll stick in the mud . Hurry along ! " " Bo-o-oys ! come back , " wailed Captain Corbet . " If you get harmed , I ca n't follow you to help you . " /z/ " Good by . " " Bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oys ! 0 , Bo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oys ! " wailed Captain Corbet , for the last time , as the boys went off . But this time they gave no re sponse . He stood in silence , watching them , for a long , long time , with deep anxiety . The other boys also looked after them with not a doubt in the minds of any of them but that they would come back . Meanwhile the boys walked on upon their dan gerous way . Perhaps their very ignorance of that danger saved them from it . They walked on in a straight line , knowing nothing of places which the people about believed to be dangerous ; and as they found the outset easy , they expected all the rest would be the same . The mud was like that which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard beneath , so that they sank in a little distance at every step , but nevertheless , found a firm foot hold . The mud was so soft , and the foothold be neath so firm , that their feet were not very badly clogged . They did not find it so difficult as walk ing over clay roads after they had been soaked with rains , and cut up by heavy teams . They walked on rapidly , in as straight a line as possible , laughing and shouting , declaring that mud flats were slandered , and that there was much worse walking on many a country road . At length the mud grew softer , arid the bottom /z/ was not so near the surface . To walk over this , even at a rapid pace , was difficult ; for where the foot was planted at full length , it would sink so that it was difficult to extricate it . A swifter pace was necessary . " Are you tired , Phil ? " asked Bruce . " No , " said Phil ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . " Because we 'll have to go faster , " said Bruce . " Come , now , boys Indian trot ! " Away they went at the peculiar pace known by that name , the body bent forward , and the fore part of the foot touching the ground with its clas tic tread , moving at that slow , steady , easy trot which is faster and lighter than a walk , and but little more fatiguing to those who have the knack of it . This carried them on very well for some considerable distance farther , and on looking back they began to congratulate themselves on the dis tance which they had already traversed . Ere long the grass-covered marsh was within sight the place where danger ended , and progress was easier . But between them and that place there still lay dif ficulties which they knew not of . Suddenly as they ran on , they were arrested by a cry from Phil . They turned instantly , and were horrified at the sight that met their eyes . Phil , being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being out of breath , had loitered a few paces BO as to recover , thinking that he would catch up . /z/ Feeling a pain hhis side , he had stopped to fasten his belt tighter around his waist , and without think ing he had stood motionless for a minute . In that minute his feet had sunk in the treacherous soil . In his sudden fright at this discoverj , he had cried out , and made a desperate effort to extricate him self . AVith a jerk he had drawn forth one foot , but the other had sunk in up to his knee . And this was the position in which he stood when the others turned . Another minute and they were by his side , pull ing at him . But as they pulled , each one found himself sinking . " Here , boys , this wo n't do , " cried Bart . " Phil , give me your hand . Boys , form a line behind me , one after another . Now let 's catch hold of one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly , so as not to stand still . Now , then , pull ! " Backward and forward the line of boys , thus rapidly formed , went swaying , pulling Phil as they did so . The clinging mud yielded , and Phil was slowly dragged forth . But his boot was left be hind . " Never mind the boot , " cried Bart . " Come on as you are , one shoe off , and the other one on , tol de rol de rido , my son John ! Hurrah ! Phil , go ahead of me , and I 'll guard the rear . " All this time , while Bart was speaking , they were running on , Phil limping with his booted and bootless feet . 310 THE B. o. w. c . " Never mind , Phil ! we 'll soon get to a place where you can take off the other boot , " said Bart , encouragingly . And now began the tug . Their run had been a long one , and their exertions excessive . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The distance still before them was great ; but they dared not stop ; they dared not even pause for an- instant , or slacken their progress in any degree . Phil was most exhausted , but he toiled on with desperate exertions . The memory of his lost boot showed him his danger . That boot left behind re mained as a terror , which drove him on . On and still on . Fainter grew the boys , but they dared not stop . All of them were panting , and laboring heavily , but no relief was near . Far off still lay the marsh with its grass a fearful dis tance to those so exhausted , and still compelled to labor so hard . " I do n't know how much longer I can stand this , " gasped Tom . " You must stand it ! Do n't stop , for your life ! " cried Bruce . The others said nothing . To speak would be but to waste their precious breath , which they were losing only too rapidly . On and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an awful fear came to some of them that it was getting softer . The fear was soon realized . /z/ Softer and softer it grew , and deeper sank their feet . Had this place only been found at an earlier period , they could have returned , or they would have had strength to struggle on ; but now it came in the hour of their extremest exhaustion . It was a hollow in the mud , somewhat lower than the sur rounding surface . " We ca n't go through this , " said Bruce ; and he pointed to the centre of the hollow , which looked fearfully soft and liquid . " Let 's go around it ; " and turning rapidly , he started off toward the right . The boys said nothing . They floundered deep in the mud , - they panted , they gasped , they moaned in the despairing efforts which they made . " -I 'll lie down , " gasped Phil . " I wo n't sink " " On , on ! Never ! We 'll all have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart , who , exhausted as he was , caught Phil 's arm , and dragged him on . At that moment Tom fell . " It 's all up with me , boys , " he moaned . " Leave me . Save yourselves . " Bruce said nothing . He snatched him up out of the mud , and pulled him along , while at this fresh exertion his whole frame quivered , and his feet sank deeper . How long could this last ? Tom could scarcely keep his feet . Phil could hardly keep upright , and move his legs . Arthur /z/ could barely stumble along . Bart and Bruce bore it best , and could help the others still . But for how long ? A shout of joy came from Bruce . " Hurrah ! Look there ! " he cried . Tom raised himself by a last effort , and turned his feeble eyes to where Bruce pointed . He saw , at a little dis tance , a green patch in the mud . It was marsh grass ! At that instant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength to their despairing ener gies . It gave new life to Tom and Phil . A few steps more , and the soft mud grew harder ; and soon after they were all standing on the patch of marsh grass . No sooner had they reached this place , than they all flung themselves down upon the mud , out of which the coarse grass grew . For some time not a word was spoken . All lay there breathing heavily . Looking back , they could see the wide extent of mud flats which they had traversed . The schooner was far away , and those on board could no longer be distinguished . The soft spot in which they had been wallowing , and out of which they had found their way , spread for a great distance , not only between them and the schooner , but also on one side . Between them and Cornwallis there appeared to be a firmer surface , like that which they had found on leaving the schooner . Besides this , there were patches of grass interspersed here /z/ and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here they might find resting-places if they were again exhausted . The spot on which they lay was the outermost of these . They did not hurry away . They needed a good long breathing-time , and they took it . Phil took off his remaining boot , declaring that if he had only got it off before , he would not have been so exhausted . He preferred walking over the mud barefoot , he said . This seemed to the others a good idea , and they all took off their boots and stockings , so as to pass over the mud more lightly . At length , after about half an hour , they all rose , and resumed their journey . The mud spread away before them ; and though there were patches of grass at intervals , yet the real marsh land itself did not come wfthin half a mile of them . This distance would have to be traversed before they could reach the nearest verge . And now , keeping their eyes fixed upon the Cornwallis shore , they all set out afresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they first set out , with this difference , that their goal was near , and resting-places frequent . Nearer and nearer they came to the marsh land ; nearer and nearer still , and now they were close to it , and now they had just reached it , when suddenly , just as they seemed to touch it , there yawned between them and that green inviting goal a deep crevice , the course of some sea current , at /z/ the bottom of which trickled , even now , some water , which probably came from one of the numerous drains of the dike land before them . The sides sloped down at an angle of forty-five degrees , and consisted of the softest mud , which seemed by its appearance ready to ingulf at once any one who might step upon it . To cross here was impossible . It could not be even ven tured upon . The ground at the edge was firm enough for them to stand and survey the situation . On the left the gully seemed to go toward the Cornwall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . Supposing that it came from the dikes , and that it would grow narrower if they ascended in that direction , they turned off toward the right . They found their surmise correct . After walking for a half mile , the gully had become much narrower , and had diminished from a width of thirty feet and a depth of twelve , to a width of ten and a depth of six . But here they found themselves at a fork , where the gully that came from the dike laud divided itself , one part going toward the Cornwallis River , and the other far down through the mud flat toward the bay . To go around it , or in any way avoid it , was impossible . It was neces sary to cross it at all hazards . " We must do it , boys , " said Bart . " So here goes . " Saying this , he threw over his boots . Then he /z/ went back for some distance . Then he rushed forward , and springing from the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and landed on the . other side . " That 's more than I can do/ ' said Tom . " I 've got to wade it . " " Nor can I , " said Phil . " Go it , Arthur , " said Bruce . Arthur went back , and took a run like Bart , and jumped . But he fell two feet short . His feet sank deep into the soft mud . He struggled for a moment , and falling forward , dug his elbows into the top of the bank . Bart seized him , and after some violent struggles he was free . After this all the boots were thrown over . Bruce encouraged Phil and Tom . " Now , boys , go it . I 'll wait here to help you . " " But we ca n't jump . " " Arthur and I will go down on this side , and Bruce on the other , and help you , " said Bart ; and he descended at the same time , followed by Arthur , while Bruce descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance , and then found bottom . Phil then went down , and gave a wild leap , and his feet just cleared the middle . For a moment he floundered , but struggled onward , and caught Bart 's hand . Another minute , and he was safe over . " I 've not got much strength left , boys , " said Tom ; @#@ but I 'll do what I can . " /z/ " Steady now wait , " said Bart , " let me get a little farther down . Arthur , give me your hand . " Saying this , Bart descended a little farther . Tom ran down , his feet sinking deep . Near the middle he tried to leap over , but his feet sank so that his leap failed . He fell short , and his advan cing foot struck the very middle of that soft pudding in the bed of the gully . He sank to his middle at once , struggling , and panting , and throwing him self forward . Deeper and deeper he sank . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought him a little nearer . Bart dropped Arthur 's hand , and clutched that which was despairingly outstretched by Tom . At the same moment Arthur caught Bart , and they dragged at their sinking companion . For some time they did nothing toward extricating him . But now with a bound Bruce had sprung across , and hurried to their assistance . Going down close by Bart , he caught Tom 's other hand . Then , with all their strength united , they pulled . Their own feet sank deep , but they thought not of that . Tom was coming out . He was out . He was saved ! Drawing out their own feet then , they helped Tom up to the top of the bank , and there they rested once more . Tom was not exhausted , but only weakened , and a few minutes were sufficient for him to rally . So , without saying much about this last adventure , they resumed their journey . /z/ There lay the marsh right before them at last . There , too , not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dike lands . Their perilous journey was at last approaching an end . Soon they were on the marsh , where the coarse grass was now " in its early spring growth , and not high enough to im pede their progress . A short journey through this brought them to the dike . It was only a feW feet in height . They climbed to the top , and looked around . There was the Cornwallis River about half a mile away , and there , farther up , the bridge that crossed it . The coarse stubble of the grass hurt their feet , so that they walked along the top of the dike toward the river . This walk was easy and pleasant ; and after their severe journey , it was even delightful . In this way they went on , till at last they reached the bank of the river , when they turned and walked up the edge toward the bridge . At first the bed of the - river was , as Bart had said , a vast abyss of soft mud , through which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this abyss ; but as they walked on , they came at length to a place where the mud was intermixed with gravel , which extended down to the water , and up on the other side . Here Bruce stopped , and looked down , and then across . " What 's the matter ? " asked the others . " 0 , nothing . I 'm thinking about trying to cross . " /z/ " To cross ! You 'll never get across , " cried Phil . " Yes , " said Bart . " It can be done . I 'll try it if you will , Bruce . You see it is n't all soft mud here , but the gravel goes down , and up the other side . I do n't believe it 's deep , either . " " Well , if it 's over our heads , we can swim a little . " " But see how strong the current is , " said Tom . " It will carry you off . " " 0 , it ca n't carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in for it . You see , boys , it 's too aggravating to look across the river here , and see the Academy close by on the other side , hardly more than a mile or so away , and then turn off for a four or five mile walk around . You fellows had better go up to the bridge , and get a wagon , and drive round . Bart and 1 will try it here , at any rate . If we ca n't get across , we 'll follow you . " Without listening to any further remonstrances , Bruce and Bart descended the slope . The bed was very wide and deep , though now nearly empty , and they did not know how deep the water might be that ran there . They expected to ford it . The other boys stood pn the bank watching them wi intense interest . The gravel , mixed with mud , formed a good footing ; and Bruce and Bart stopped here for a time , and put their boots on , so that if they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ /z/ The water was running swiftly by . It seemed wider now than it did at the top of the bank . But they did not hesitate . In they went side by side , Bruce on the right , and Bart below him on the left . The water grew deeper and deeper . It came up to their waists , then up to their armpits . Bart could not possibly stem it a moment longer . He was lifted from his feet , and borne on . Those waiting at the top of the bank felt their hearts stop beating as they looked . But Bart 's head was above water , and he struck , out bravely for the opposite shore . He knew he would not have far to swim , for he had already gone nearly half way when he was swept off ' his feet . The current still bore him down , but his own efforts were dragging him to the opposite shore at every stroke . After Bart had lost his footing , Bruce still walked on . He held himself so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last he , too , lost his footing , and was swept after Bart . He struck out strongly ; and while carried down by the cur rent , he , too , drew nearer the opposite shore . Bart had just touched bottom , and sprang up , with the water scarce higher than his waist , and looked around for Bruce . As he looked , he caught sight of Bruce 's face . It was turned toward him in agony , close by him , and but a little behind . Two hands were flung out , and with a gasp and a groan Bruce sank . /z/ For an instant Bart stood petrified with horror . A wild thought of sharks flashed through his mind . But the next instant he had grasped Bruce , and was dragging him half fainting , still gasping , out of the water . In a few minutes they were on the bank , where they both sat down . " It was a a palpitation of the the heart , " gasped Bruce . " I 've felt queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . You 'll have to keep quiet , Bruce , for some months to come . You see you 've been ex erting yourself tremendously to-day , and this last thing has been too much . You 've got to look out , for a thing like this is not to be trifled with . " By this time the other boys had rushed down , and were on the opposite side halloing , and asking what was the matter . " 0 , nothing a doldrum of Bruce 's , " cried Bart . " He 's all right now . " " All right ! " said Bruce , lifting up his pale face , and nodding . " You hurry up , boys , " said Bart . " Get a horse at the bridge , and drive home . " Upon this the boys left , and went to the bridge . After abo.ut a quarter of an hour , Bruce felt able to start . They ascended the bank slowly ; and after reaching the dike land , they went across in a straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Bruce regained his strength more and more at every step . /z/ At length they reached the gateway of the Academy grounds . Wet to the skin , handkerchiefs round their heads , with their clothes ragged , and plastered with mud from head to foot , so that hardly any of the original color was visible , these two forlorn figures attracted universal attention ; and soon all the small boys were around them cheering , and shouting , and asking about the schooner . Out came Mr. Long , who had arrived the pre vious evening without accident . Out came Dr. Porter , astonishment in his face . Out came every inhabitant of the Academy and its precincts , all making inquiries . And , last of all , out came Solomon , with an enor mous white collar standing up above his ears , and , " 0 , de gracious ! 0 , de sakes alive , now ! What 's dis dat dis ole nigga does see ! You gwine away whar glory takes you , an ' back agin to be de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whar 's all de rest ob all dem bressed chil'en ? 0 , dis delightful day an ' hour !

What 's become ob all de Wenebble Breddren ? Heah comes de Wenebble Patrick , an ' de Wenebble Wodden , wid de Gran ' Panjydanderum in da shinin ' train ! 0 , dis day an ' hour ! " /z/ And with exclamations like these , poured forth with amazing volubility , Solomon walked along backward before them , and his voice died away in the distance to a prolonged and unintelligible hubble-bubble.
