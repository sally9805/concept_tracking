Boker , George H. ( George Henry ) , 1823-1890 : TO MRS . ELIZA CONRAD . from To Mrs. Eliza Conrad ( 1862 ) From thee , pure source of Conrad 's birth , Arose his virtues ; through thee ran Whatever heavenly gleams of worth Above us dignified the man . By thee his childish soul was taught , His nobler instincts brought in play , That , while with darkened days he fought , Flashed outward through his mortal clay . What if they cry , who pry and probe , " Lo ! here a speck , or there a flaw ! " He scorned the dust upon his robe Far more than any one who saw . The dust he gathered on his path Was common dust ,  --  what skirt is clear ?  --  He shook it off , in holy wrath , Ere to God 's presence he drew near . O merciful and patient God , We trust these songs of faith and love , Pleading for him beneath the sod , Have moved as only song can move ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , free from stain , Before Thy face transfigured stands , From tainting earth washed pure again ; So that she too may come before Thy mercy-seat quite reconciled , And to her bosom take once more The early memory of her child ! I , as he wished , and in his name , To thee , whose love o'erruled his fate , This last , best chaplet of his fame Thus solemnly do dedicate . G. H. B. Philadelphia , July 1 , 1862.
