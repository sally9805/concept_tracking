PAST , PRESENT , AND FUTURE . TT may seem paradoxical to say that the same circumstance which most owerfully contributed to the elevation of the present ruler of the French , has been at the same time the most formidable obstacle in his path . He was elected President of the Republic because he was a Bonaparte ; the coup d'etat and sudden bursting forth of the Empire , in 1851 , were submitted to because he was a Bonaparte ; and from that day to this he has never been trusted by his own people , or by other nations-because he is a Bonaparte . When he became President , his character was as yet totally unknown to the French people ; but they had tired of Bourbon absolutism , Orleanist old fogyism and republican extravagance , and looked back longingly to the dazzling era of Napoleonic ascendency . At the outset , then , appears this fact : That the present sovereign , perceiving why he , and not another , was chosen , announced himself to -V be the heir as well of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . The Empire opened its remarkable career with that understanding , and thence have proceeded the most serious embarrassments which have environed its progress . People looked forward to a second edition of the old Empire , crimes , blunders and all ; so that every act of Napoleon IlL has been construed to have a hidden and malicious motive . He had avowed his intention to finish the work left undone by the unwilling hermit of St. Helena ; and men have ever since been looking for him to begin it . Those startling principles and motives of action which awakened and kept alive an unparalleled *terror throughout Europe in the beginning of the century , have been yearly expected . The aggrandizement of France was supposed to be the corner-stone of the new creed . Belgium and other little fishes on the French border , it was predicted , would certainly some fine morning be gulped up by this monster shark which had grown in a day . Hardly a year has passed in which we have not heard whisperings of some dark design , whether against England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man as the late Lord Lyndhurst talked quite absurdly in the House of Lords about French bayonets invading the sanctity of English firesides . There has been a widely existing idea that Napoleon IlL was perpetually employed in maturing dark and tortuous plots to disturb the peace of the world ; that the Tuileries had been turned into a kind of political alchemist 's laboratory , where spells and concoctions were being invented to destroy rival Powers , and elevate the magician to the utmost grandeur of human authority . // Still , we have arrived at the close of the year 1866 . Napoleon has ruled in France more than eighteen years , and has worn the Impedal crown more than fifteen ; he has passed the prime of his life , and the vigor of his constitution is visibly declining ; opportunities have not been wanting in which he might have extended the French frontier and made alliances for offensive objects which would have insured success and an enormous reward of spoils ; at times we have heard a cry breaking forth from one end of France to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuit of conquest , and the head of the State , with rare ability , holding in check the characteristic vehemence of his people . Wherein then , throughout his career , do we find ground for the suspicions , the oft-repeated apprehensions , the tortured constructions of every word and act , which have followed the Emperor , like the gadfly , from his first day of Empire to the present ? There was the trade for Savoy and Nice , it is true , made after the tough work of Solferino ; but does so small an affair as that convict Napoleon of a policy and hercditary thirst of aggrandizement ? The truth is , that if he ever seriously entertained a purpose to continue the policy of the first Emperor , that purpose has been abandoned . He has been wise enough to perceive that this age would not suffer a repetition of the old Empire . He has therefore , in reality , governed quite independently of the supposed Napoleonic ideas . He has ceased to endeavor to follow in his uncle 's footsteps . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own dynasty , to lie in a policy of peace and internal development ; and therefore , peace he has sedulously cultivated . As we glance back over those eighteen years which have witnessed the growth of the present dynasty to its present condition , we are struck by the remarkable manner in which Napoleon has sailed , to use a trite expression , with the current . With all the anticipations which he himself created at the outset , he has hardly once violated in his foreign policy the modern ideas of the world ; has never once shocked those ideas by ostentatious defiance . It is not the object of this article to laud the Empire , to excuse its blunders , or to defend the false principles upon which many of its acts have been founded . Before my conclusion is reached , I shall strive to point out some radical deficiencies , and to show wherein there is disease which , if not cured , may kilL But where we looked for bloodshed , for grievous and unreasoning tyranny , for utter indifference to popular and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order grow up with a miraculous growth ; we have seen graceful concessions to national sentiment ; we have seen sympathy with stinggling peoples seeking independence ; we have seen a turning away from temptation which in a Bonaparte is wonderful . The foreign policy of the Empire until very recently has been an 12 // enigma . The present year seems to have in a great measure cleared away the obscurity which enveloped it . The idea that Napoleon was only seeking for an occasion to develop a warlike and aggressive design must yield before the light of recent events . Had it appeared to be the decided will of the French people-had no other means presented themselves by which to secure the Napoleonic dynasty-we can not doubt that such a policy would have been entered upon ; in truth , when the public mind seemed , at one time , to be growing restless and dissatisfied with inaction , the experiment of Mexico was made . The complete failure of that experiment ( which was at its very outset a failure , if it was made with the hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no step was ever more thoroughly disapproved by a national sentiment ) has notably convinced the Emperor that his cue is not conquestthat the French have grown beyond the age when they were tickled by the baubles of military glory ; and it is found that from the moment when the mistake of Mexico was realized , there has been no further attempt to add martial lustre to the moral guarantees of the Imperial throne . The two wars in which we have seen France engaged since the rise of the Empire-that with Russia and that with Austria in 1859 , can not be said to have been undertaken from greed of conquest . In the former , France gained nothing which the other European States did not gain . By the Crimean war the overgrowth of Russian power was checked , and the treatment of Napoleon I. by Russia avenged . In the Italian war of 185* , France , it is true , gained Savoy and Nice , but it is absurd to suppose that that great struggle was undertaken merely for a prize so insignificant . The balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival Power as a check upon Austria in the south ; and the war was popular with the French people , both by reason of their impulsive and generous sympathy with Italy , and because Napoleon I. was once more avenged in the humiliation of Austria . Both wars were approved by the nation , and neither can properly be called aggressive . Another striking event in the Imperial policy was the alliance with England , and the commercial treaty accorded to that ancient rivaL The alliance can never be said to have been a cordial one ; distrust on one side , popular dislike on the other , have prevented that ; still it has been an alliance working good results to both nations . In the recent German war , there was a rare opportunity offered to France to aggrandize herself by the misfortunes of others . The Rhine frontier might have been hers almost without bloodshed ; beyond that , she might easily have prevented the consummation of that German unity to which the monarchical statesmen of France have always looked forward with jealous dread . Still France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own results ; and when // the fortune of war determined the issue in favor of that Power best able to consolidate the Teuton race , neither remonstrance nor obstacle came from Napoleon . He made , it is true , a proposition to Count Bismark that the Rhine provinces should be annexed to his crown , to satisfy the restless spirit of his people ; but the proposition being declined , he waived the point , thus showing a marked disinclination to take up arms for the aggrandizement of France ; and this is one more and a conclusive proof that his settled policy is one of peace , and that he seeks rather moral than military triumphs . Yet , the military strength of France is sedulously kept at its maximum ; and it has resulted from this fact , and from the now deliberate conviction of European Powers that the foreign policy of the Emperor is one of moderation , and that he has abandoned , with the approbation of his subjects , the idea of martial aggression , that he possesses such a moral power as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations in difficulty look for protection and wise counsel . At the present moment , therefore , we find that France is only larger by Savoy and Nice than when Napoleon was elected President of the Republic in 1848 ; that she is on amicable terms , to say the least , with Russia , with England , with Prussia , with Italy , and with the United States ; that , if she is not just now beloved by Austria , at least there is no hostility between the two , only a little soreness on one side , which may certainly be excused in a Power crushed by defeat , surrounded by ever increasing troubles , and hardly daring to look forward to the future ; that she is , in a sense , the patron both of German and Italian independence ; and that to the Emperor Napoleon , more than to any other potentate , is confided the arbitration of all European disputes , and the grateful and lofty office of restoring the blessings of peace to all the nations . The Marquis de la Yalette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the French diplomatic agents abroad a few months ago , in which were clearly announced the leading principles of the future foreign policy of the Government . This paper , without doubt , emanated directly from the Emperor himself and may be regarded as showing forth his real views upon the subject . It was a most sio*nificant paper . It seemed to dispel all that suspicion which had hitherto looked darkly upon Napoleon 's movements ; it was a reassurance to the world . To impartial minds there was a frank simplicity , a sincere explicitness about it which was all the more striking as it contrasted so remarkably with previous emanations from the same source . It announced the abandonment of that old , petty jealousy which looked with disfavor upon the prosperity of neighboring and of rival States . It heralded the dawning of an age of great nationalities , the final dissolution of feudalism , the extinction of small sovereignties . It acknowledged a larger and // more generous ambition than that of sowing dissensions among competing States , of keeping divided into many a race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unification of Germany , with a tone of welcome the independence and the massing together of Italy . France would never , it declared , interpose any obstacle to the accomplishment of an undivided State , erected by the will of a whole people . It was rather for France not only to coincide in , but even to further , the resolution of Europe into a few great Powers . France had nothing further to desire in the way of territory ; there might be necessary , in the great changes which would doubtless occur , some slight modifications of boundaries ; but France had enough , was strong enough , and should only retain an army for defence . The destiny of France , her province , was to devote herself to internal improvement , develop her resources , become great as a maritime , a manufacturing , an agricultural , and an intellectual country ; to compete with her sisters in an active but peaceful race toward the highest civilization ; to put herself in the van , if possible , of human progress . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outspoken as this . *lebrated paper was . Belgium was a little uneasy - that clause about great nationalities was unwelcome to her ; Switzerland , too , began to fear that that meant her own absorption . But the world , the press everywhere , seeing how reasonable and how wise the policy indicated would be if really intended to be pursued , and being unable to imagine why it should be thrown out as a blind , accepted the manifesto of the Emperor as sincere ; and we have since seen a new feeling spreading everywhere  --  a strange feeling , indeed , recoliecting all these years of Napolcopliobia ( if I may invent a word )  --  a feeling absolutely of trust and . confidence in the Imperial word . On the whole , then , we are able to find but little serious fault with the foreign policy of the Empire ; there has been nothing in it startling or shocking ; in many cases it has worked conspicuous good to the world . That policy , acting positively , has kept Russia from undue encroachment in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English alliance , has enabled Italy to achieve her unity and independence ; and , acting negatively , has permitted a great Germany to swell from many miserable petty Germanys . In two cases , however , that policy has been unfortunate , and both these have had reference to the American Continent . Mexico will be the most ominous Word in the future history of the second Empire ; that was a sore mistake , and is now so acknowledged by him who made it . Napoleon was likewise unfortunate in his policy , or attempted policy , of recognizing Southern independence ; and he J*as to thank the caution and indecision of his British neighbor that // it never matured into a grievous wrong . It was an attempt to help one unwise act by another , and perhaps it was one of his most fortunate escapes that the occasion which he sought never came . As it is , France feels the effect of the mere attempt , the intention , by that coolness on the part of the re-united and triumphant American Nation , which has taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the other hand , there does not exist that almost universal and almost justifiable hostility toward France which our people evince toward England , for the very simple reason that France kept the same professed neutrality which England openly violated . The internal policy of the Empire , past and present , as compared with its foreign policy , presents at once more striking evidencea of administrative vigor , and more circumstances worthy of just blame . To the stranger who studiously contemplates France , the first thought is , how prosperous , how thriving , how busy is this nation of revolutions ! What activity in every department of industry and commerce , what vigor in internal improvement , what order and regularity in the civil administration ! When he has learned his lesson a little more thoroughly , however , he exclaims : Ah , there is freedom to work , but not to think ; there is universal suffrage , but the people are not represented ; the Protestant clergy are paid from the Imperial treasury to preach Protestant doctrine , but there is not freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bay , but they also break up public gatherings ; there is thrift on the farm and busy activity at the factories , but there are grievous taxes bearing down the poor ; there is a capable , a vigorous , an ever-watchful Government , but a Government wielded by a single hand-set in motion from a single spring . These are the two phases which the Empire reflects from within : high prosperity , absolute authority . The idea of the Empire is the idea of a representative man receiving from the people the sanction to govern despotically . Napoleon Ill , has written the life of C*esar , is writing that of Charlemagne , and constantly points to the example of his illustrious uncle , to prove that this is true government ; and the world infers , without doubt correctly , that the theory he has thus so ably advanced is the theory upon which he has founded and has so far carried on with brilliant ability the Lm* perial system . And the prosperity which we see everywhere in France at present results from the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been in hands singularly able* and under the direction of an active , a clear-sighted , and a politic mind . The result is that there has been a harmony in the action of all the depixtments of the State , a unity of plan , the whole force of execution de*roted to the objects proposed . For centuries France has not thrived so well , on the sea and on land , in manufacture and // internal trade . There is a reserved military strength such as Napoleon I. never possessed . Education is fostered by the Government , and no one can say that the blessing of intelligence is not rapidly spreading itself among the lower classes . Charities , hospitals , benevolent enterprises , are no less encouraged by the powers of the Tuileries . The commercial system of France approaches each year nearer to a free trade standard , and the ports grow in population and activity more rapidly than do those of free and constitutional England . Under the auspices of the Government , railways are being built , canals dug , the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbors enlarged , streets broadened and paved , roads everywhere widened and made more easy of traveL The police system , as far as its efficiency in preserving public order is concerned , is well nigh perfect , and is in marked contrast with the police systems of all other nations in the completeness with which its duties are fulfilled . A more than paternal ( perhaps it would be more grateful to the people if it were less so ) control is exercised over the popular amusements , over corporations , and certain branches of trade . But we have to remark , in the midst of all these beneficent results of a strong , absolute , and able Imperial rule , other circumstances which not only can not be approved by intelligent minds accustomed to constitutional liberty , but also which seem to bear within themselves such seeds of disease as may ripen to the destruction of the Imperial system . There is a constant jealousy of the press ; a jealousy which discovers and promptly punishes all demonstrations hostile to the Imperial policy or the hnpenal house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less of that systematic personality which was the salient feature of the French press under Louis Philippe of Orleans , there is likewise a grave danger to Imperialism in displaying its sensitiveness in the sight of the people , as well as a serious deprivation in preventing the nation from weighing antagonistic ideas and arriving at the truth . A very short time since , a small provincial paper , published at Orleans , was warned because " it published statements tending to alarm the public in regard to the Emperor 's health . " Another paper received a similar reprimand , for a similar cause , at Arras . A Bordeaux journal was also warned because it " published remarks insulting to the Pope , " and the Nantes " Phare de la Loire " was , some time ago , suspended for two months for saying that " Solferino was a success in spite of bad generalship "  --  a remark supposed to reflect upon the military talents of the Emperor . Such instances , occurring weekly , serve to remind the people only too vividly that a stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is a perpetual reminder that they are not altowed to think . The French reason less than they feel ; and when they experience so uractical an evidence of despotism , they become // more dangerous to the Empire than the free promulgation of logical ideas most hostile to it . People who are impulsive are easily galled ; and when we reflect that the Empire never had the enthusiastic , overwhelming support of all classes , it is easily seen that alienation , increased by the instigations of original Orleanists and Republican malcontents , must work rapidly in presence of that grievous restriction of free speech to which I refer . An apparent consistency with the theory of Imperialism is maintained by the universal suffrage which is supposed to exist in France ; and at first view this would seem to be just , and to indicate that the Empire and its policy are in truth endorsed by the nation . This universal suffrage , however , is , upon closer inspection , found to be but a pretence ; it is a mockery of the people which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the press . The legislature is composed of the Senate , entirely of Imperial creation , and the Corps Legislat*f , nominally elected by the people . Now the Corps Legislatij ; as at present constituted , is found to contain a very large majority in favor of the Imperial Government ; and yet a survey of the representation brings to sending one member , is represented by nine Opposition , and but one Imperialist . So Lyons , Lille , Marseilles , Nantes , Havre , and Strasbourg send each an Opposition member to the Chamber . The reason why , therefore , we find so large a preponderance of Imperialists in that body is that the Empire , conscious that its most substantial support must be from the country , so regulated the electoral districts that the rural provinces , in proportion to population , should send more deputies than the cities . The representatives from the country , therefore , are Imperialist ; those from the cities are either Republican or Orleanist . The rural districts , it is easy to see , are more readily controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police ; political harangues and canvassing are forbidden by express law ; and the common country farmers , left uninformed and at the mercy of Government authorities , vote regularly for the Empire . What little reason , too , this class exercises at all in regard to politics , leads them to prefer an existing , strong , protective dynasty to the hazards and change of revolution ; and they have always been found-at least since their emancipation from the great landed nobility in 89-supporting the existing government for the time being . In the Corps Legislat*f before the present one , there were but five Opposition deputies ; now there are between thirty and forty ; in the next that number will doubtless be fully doubled . This fact is full of significance , and an easy inference may be made from it as to the pro* gressive popularity of the Imperial system . France is divided into provincial departments . Over each department // is set a viceroy , called a Prefect , who acts with absolute vicarious authority in bce Imperatoris . The local administrations are totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Imperial policy and person ; they " do not care a fig , " as a Frenchman said to me , somewhat petulantly , " for public opinion . " Their destinies are wrapped up in that of the Napoleonic house ; when that falls , they expect to fall , and it is their interest to maintain it , therefore , by a rigid exercise of its authority . So that France is divided into nearly a hundred little despotisms , each the shadow of the gigantic despotism at Paris . There are two more points in which we observe a spirit proceeding from the Government which is calculated to operate unfavorably upon its future ; both relate , as everything in truth which is wrongly done in France does , to the liberties of the subject . You would infer from the fact that a Protestant Church is in part supported by the treasury of a Catholic Power , that there must be religious liberty in the country where this phenomenon appears . There is in France a regular Protestant system , subsidized by the Government ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own sphere , and sustain the Empire , and do not seek to interfere with the Catholics either by attempted conversions or by denouncing them from the pulpit . Still the fact remains , that there is not religious liberty in France . A clergyman can not go to France from America or England and preach the doctrines of Protestant Christianity to the French ; at least he has to have the special permission of the Government to do it . You can not build a Baptist , a Presbyterian , or Episcopalian Church in France , and go and preach in it , and administer the communion to the subjects of Napoleon . If you wish to be a Protestant in France , you must be a Protestant according to Imperial notions . You must subscribe to the doctrines and hear the preachings of the French Protestant Establishment . Worship in your own way you can not . You must be a Protestant after certain prescribed methods-prescribed , too , by a political - systeii* for its own convenience . Some English clergymen of various *denominations have been seeking permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provinces , and solicitations the *rnost earnest and persevering have been of no effect . And even in - that very French Protestant Church itself there is no life , no vital moving power , because it is restricted , and hemmed in , and confined to a certain specified routine . It stands stilL In countries where there is religious freedom , churches grow , branches sprout everywhere , every seeiety swells larger and receives new life and vigor every year . The French church does not increase . It continues weak and listless , simply because it has not space ; in a word , has not tib*erty . Henry IV . did many great things in France , and his greatest act was The memorable Edict of Nantes . His grandson , // Louis XIV. , did many mean and wicked things , but the meanest and wickedest of all his acts , that which has more than all other things blackened his prolific reign in the eyes of posterity , was the revocation of that same Edict , his grandsire 's proudest laurel . There are not wanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that act ; and certainly the absence of religious liberty hastened the first revolution . Neither is Catholicism under the Empire so independent as it was under the Bourbons and Orleanists . As Napoleon I. used the circumstance of the abasement of the priests to build up his power by making the Concordat , thus subjecting the church to conditions , so Napoleon III . has done likewise ; the bishops are to-day , in many instances , his creatures , and he holds the whole ecclesiastical system in his palm . I can do no more than mention one other respect in which popular liberty is denied , to subserve the practicability of an absolute system  --  the prohibition of public gatherings to discuss political questions . The right of communication is so completely understood and appreciated in America , it is so easy to imagine what a grievous restraint its prohibition would be upon all thought and intellectual enterprise , that it is quite unnecessary to dilate upon its effect in France , where the people , if careless of politics , keenly feel a practic*d and constantly present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accumulation of instances wherein liberty is denied in France , and to prove that there liberty is not merely a sentimental idea , but a practical , tangible object-an every-day want . Thus it is , however , that this singularly able man , much abler as an administrator and as a diplomatist than his uncle , has built up his Empire , and has introduced that wonderful harmony and singleness of purpose which is to be observed in the internal policy of France . By paralyzing all means of opposition , by centering in his own hands all the engiuery of government , and in his own mind all the operations of political thought , he has been able not only to make France what it is , but also to raise her to her present position in such a manner as to have strengthened his own dynasty as well , never once to have grievously shocked or injured his people , and nearly always going in exactly the direction by them desired . So , while he has restricted public liberty , his policy , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and surprisingly successful . He has sailed with the popular current in everything save this one thing-freedom ; that fact , after three revolutions to achieve it , the French can never forget , although they may postpone the retribution . It is probable , so keen is his comprehension of French character , so prompt is he in anticipating and warding off hostility of opinion , and so constant and evident are his efforts to make his people great and prosperous , that he will die , as he has lived , Emperor // of the French . While it is impossible to measure party strength in France , owing to the double reason that there is no liberty of demonstration , and that the French , when they do act , act rather from impulse than from settled conviction , it is safe to believe that the mass are contented with the vigor and success , if not the despotism , of the Empire under its present head ; and that while Napoleon lives , no attempt at revolution would be successful . But Napoleon 's life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncertain thing to reckon upon ; he is afflicted with a disease which seems to have become chronic ; he ages visibly from month to month ; his health becomes more precarious every day . How will it be when he dies ? Should his heir be old enough to assume the direction of affairs , his throne would only be safe in case he displayed the same administrative vigor , the same insight into character , the same shrewdness in making despotism coincident with high prosperity , which have been the salient features of his predecessor 's career . If he failed in these , Imperialism would no longer be submitted to , simply because the nation would then have its bane without its benefits . While there is no means of telling what the strength of the Orleanist and revolutionary opposition is , it is quite certain that these elements are not to be despised . Within them is included almost every one of the first minds in France ; there are Thiers , Gui*ot , Favre , Girardin , Barrot , Hugo , Laboulaye , Pelletan , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle class , contain multitudes of constitutional monarchists , who would welcome with joy the restoration of the heirs of Louis Philippe ; a large majority of the lower classes in the cities are unquestionably for revolution and a republic . Let the Empire once show an indication of weakness ; let it halt only a little , and its doom is sealed . When the strong arm which now supports it so sturdily shall be withdrawn , and one less strong shall take its place , there will be a cry for liberty ; and then , perhaps , there will be no more a question of Imperialism , but rather a contest to see whether constitutionalism or democracy will prevail . There is unquestionably a grave doubt whether there will ever be a Napoleon IV . The heir of the house of Bonaparte is too young to give an indication of his future perhaps there never was a time when so much has hung upon how the character of a single individual would develop . I do not believe in another bloody revolution ; the tyranny of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloodthirsty desire of revenge ; but it is not to be concealed that a dynasty can never be secure in its descent from a strong hand to a weak , which sets practical liberty at defiance , and which is built upon a theory incompatible with the free action of thought , the free competition of principles , and the free exercise of worship .
