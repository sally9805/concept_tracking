Main text ACT I. Scene : Hades . Pluto , Mercury . Pluto . Pluto . My Furies all are getting old , and fill Their office , I protest , extremely ill ; Go , Mercury , to Earth , and gather there A score or so ; there ' s plenty and to spare , I warrant me , among the womankind , By use and disposition well designed For Fury-service of the active sort . Examine well , and bring me due report . Mercury . Mercury . I 'm off at once ! I fancy I can find Fifty , at least , exactly to your mind ; Sharp-tongued , sour-visaged , malice-loving ladies Whom others than yourself have wished in Hades ! Exit Mercury ACT II . Scene : Olympus : Juno 's boudoir . Juno , Iris . Juno . Juno . I 'm much annoyed , good Iris , with the airs Of vaunting Venus ,  --  as if all affairs In heaven and earth were under her control ! I hear she boasts that scarce a human soul Is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world are fain to fall Upon their knees at her command , and own No equal goddess on the Olympian throne . Iris . Iris . Is ' t possible ? Juno . Juno . Yes , Iris , worse than that , She and her boy , ( a mischief-breeding brat ! ) Who aids his mother by his wicked art , Declare ( O shame ! ) there ' s not a female heart In all the universe  --  below , above  --  Which has not felt the subtle force of love ! An arrant falsehood , spoken just to vex The Queen of Heaven , and scandalize the sex . Among the earthly maidens , therefore , go , And bring me back some evidence to show That Cytherea says  --  what is n't so ! Iris . Iris . I fly ! and never for a moment doubt I 'll bring you proofs to wipe the slander out . Exit Iris . ACT III . Scene . same as before . Juno reading . ( Enter Iris . ) Iris . Iris . O gracious Queen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must say , if love is such a crime As well I know it is , ( the more ' s the pity ! ) There ' s not a place on earth  --  hamlet or city  --  That is n't full of it ! In actual life ' T is the chief topic ; fiction , too , is rife With endless talk about it . On the stage , In poems , songs , ' t is everywhere the rage . Love , love , was still the theme where'er I went , In court , cot , castle , and the warrior 's tent , Love-knots , love-plots , love-murders !  --  such a rush For love-romances in the papers  --  Juno . Juno . Hush ! Do stop your prattle , Iris , and confess You found some souls as yet untainted  --  Iris . Iris . Yes ! That is , I heard of three ,  --  three virgin breasts That never once had throbbed at Love 's behests . Juno . Juno . Of course you brought them with you . Three will prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iris . Iris . Well  --  no  --  unluckily , the day before A royal messenger from Pluto 's shore Took them away to grace his grimy court , His stock of Furies being something short . Juno faints , and curtain falls .
