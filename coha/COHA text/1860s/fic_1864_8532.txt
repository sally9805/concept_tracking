Margaret discovered , sitting in a large wooden Armchair , near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pierrot enters . Pierrot . Pierrot How industrious , Mother Margaret ; and so early yet . Margaret . Margaret It is necessary , my boy . Pierrot . Pierrot Yes ; but one must not overwork oneself . Margaret . Margaret Well , I do not avoid trouble and industry . I am robust yet ; and we live upon the proceeds of our work . Pierrot . Pierrot Yes , you are not like Mamsell Marie ; one would scarcely believe that she belonged to you . She looks more like a city damsel than a Savoyard girl !  --  But I do n't see her : where is she ? Margaret . Margaret She is asleep yet  --  young blood needs a good deal of sleep . I  --  well , I work for her ; she may sleep an hour longer , then , without neglecting anything . Pierrot Pierrot Touched . You are a good mother ! just like mine , when she was alive . Does Marie remain at home , or emigrate to Paris with the others ? Margaret Margaret Lively . Emigrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see her ! Emigrate , indeed ! Others may have the courage to send their children into foreign lands ; I do not part with my only child . Pierrot . Pierrot That 's right , Mother Margaret ; I like to hear that . You are my man ! Mother , look at me ; I am but a simple goatherd , but  --  you may believe it or not  --  I would rather eat my black bread here , than the finest and best victuals in Paris . One knows what one has here , and if it does n't amount to much , it is home-made , any way . Lonstalot enters during the last speech , and puts his Hat upon the Footstool , L. back on Stage . Pierrot Pierrot Looking around . See  --  Father Lonstalot ! did n't know that you were here . How are you ? Lonstalot Lonstalot During the entire scene sullen and bad-humored . To die in misery , there or here , amounts to the same , I 'm thinking ! In Paris one may expect , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! all you can expect is misery and misfortune . Nothing but cares and poverty  --  bailiffs , sheriffs and rascals like Mons. Laroque . Pierrot . Pierrot You mean my lady 's steward and middleman , who looks like my black he-goat , when he is about having a fight . Margaret . Margaret Have you seen him , father ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot Just now . Margaret Margaret Frettingly . Well ! is he really determined to sell our farm lease ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot Even to day ! Margaret . Margaret Is there no hope of getting our contract renewed ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot None whatever . Margaret . Margaret Oh ! good heavens ! Lonstalot Lonstalot With emphasis . I have prayed and begged him , as I would only pray and beg to Him who reigns above us , but without avail ! he would not listen ! Pierrot . Pierrot The heartless villain ! he ca n't be a good man . Margaret Margaret To Lonstalot . You ought to have gone to the castle , and seen my lady the Marchioness herself . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have too many concurrents . There is Jean Le Blanc and others  --  they are able to refer to their pockets and give security , while I have the misfortune to owe a quarter 's rent . Margaret . Margaret I thought his reverence was going to speak a good word for us . Lonstalot . Lonstalot It will be of no use . What is a good word compared to ready cash ? In short , you may as well know that Mons. Laroque wants to sell our little cottage , even to-day ! Margaret Margaret Rising . Sell our poor cottage ? where my parents died , and where my child was born ! Oh , heavens ! is it possible ? Father , what is to become of us ? is there no help ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot Whatever heaven and Mons. Laroque conclude , will be done . Sits down , taking his head in his hands . Margaret . Margaret Let us try to be composed . Here comes Marie . Marie enters from door R. , and puts a Basket upon the Wardrobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Lonstalot Lonstalot Shortly . Good morning . Kisses her on the forehead . Pierrot Pierrot Friendly . Good morning , Marie . Aside . How handsome she looks to-day  --  damn it ! Marie . Marie You dear , bad mother ! before I give you a morning kiss I have to scold you . You never awake me , and I sleep so soundly ; then you do the work alone . It was so yesterday , and to-day . That is not right , dear mother . Kisses her . Pierrot . Pierrot She has a heart , soft as butter . Lonstalot . Lonstalot She is right , mother ; you are making an indolent girl of her . A proud damsel , as though she was an heiress , and to become a duchess one of these days . The Lord only knows what will become of her . Marie . Marie I am satisfied , if heaven grants that I may not be parted from you , dear parents . Aside . And from Andre ! Margaret . Margaret You are right , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our heavenly father , and no wrong will ever befall you . Embraces her . Pierrot Pierrot In the background . See  --  who comes there ? it seems  --  yes  --  it is  --  Satan himself . Marie . Marie Who do you say , Pierrot ? Pierrot . Pierrot Mons. Laroque ! Lonstalot . Lonstalot What ! already ? Pierrot . Pierrot In company with a fine-looking gentleman , whom I 've never seen . They come this way . Lonstalot . Lonstalot To drive us away , beyond a doubt ! Well , in heaven 's name , let them come ; I am prepared for the worst ! Marie Marie Astonished . To drive us away , father ? Sees her mother crying . Mother , what has happened ? Why are you crying ? Margaret . Margaret My poor child ! you will know it too soon . Let us pray , Marie , for heaven is our only protector in future . Laroque appears in the background ; looks into the cottage , and seems to motion to the Commander , that he may enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The others salute , loyally . Pierrot Pierrot Aside ; looking daggers at Laroque . I am burning to let that fellow feel the weight of my fist . Commander Commander In the background . Well , Laroque , you say the handsome country-bird we met is hiding in the mystic darkness of this stable ? Laroque Laroque With low voice . Yes , my lord . These are her parents . Draws back respectfully . Commander Commander Aside . Now , Commander , the time has come to show the oratorical powers you possess , and the refined , majestic manner of your deportment . Coming forward Good country people  --  H m ! H m ! Good people !  --  Bon jour ! bon jour ! Lonstalot Lonstalot Bowing . My noble lord ! Commander . Commander Which of you is named Antoine Lonstalot ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot I am the person , my lord . Commander . Commander Ah !  --  you , my brave man ! Are you the possessor of a daughter who , Zephyr like , brings the woodsmen and goatherds their daily dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , my lord  --  here she is  --  come near , Marie  --  it seems you draw very good company to our house . Marie Marie Frightened . I , father ?  --  I really do not know . Aside Has Andre , perhaps . Commander Commander To Lonstalot . My good friend , be gentle and good , natured to your charming daughter . He takes her hand . Marie Marie Recognizing him . Oh Heavens ! Commander . Commander Be of good cheer , my charming M'lle Marie ; I did not come to afflict your two beautiful Savoyard eyes , but  --  Lonstalot Lonstalot Roughly . Your honor will please pardon me ,  --  but her name is merely Marie  --  we have no mademoiselles here Laroque Laroque Insinuatingly . What one is not already , one may soon become . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Yes , sir ; but if you have no objection , we 'd rather remain what we are ! Commander Commander In low voice , to Laroque . You have not deceived me , Laroque ; there seems to be a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My lord ! the girl can not escape you . They speak secretly to each other . Margaret Margaret During the above dialogue in conversation with her husband .  --  Aloud . I tell you , I do want it . Lonstalot Lonstalot Half aloud to Margaret . And I tell you , I do not . Commander Commander Listening . Well , my brave friends , what is the matter ?  --  what is the cause of your dispute ? Margaret . Margaret My gracious lord , we are the lessees of this little farm , which belongs to her ladyship , the Marchioness de Sivry ; and since Marie is her godchild , she  --  Pierrot . Pierrot Yes , that 's a fact ; she held Marie over the holy baptismal font when she was but so high . Margaret Margaret Scarcely able to hold herself any longer . And notwithstanding this  --  oh ! it is unpardonable !  --  because we are in the rear with a quarter 's rent  --  Pierrot . Pierrot With a mean quarter ! Margaret . Margaret They have attached everything in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose . Pierrot . Pierrot And even the brown cow , with the star on her breast , is to be taken from her little one . Margaret . Margaret And if the sum is not paid by to-morrow , they are going to sell this cottage , where our only child  --  our Marie  --  was born . Violently And all , because Monsieur Laroque is our enemy . Pierrot Pierrot Advancing . Yes , my lord , he has the audacity to be their most intimate enemy ! Commander Commander With affected severity . What do I hear ?  --  how ? Do you , Monsieur Laroque dare to  --  Laroque . Laroque But , my lord , it was yourself who  --  Commander Commander Interrupting him . Silence !  --  you are a jackass ! Pierrot . Pierrot By my he-goat ! though the gentleman is not his god-father , he has given him the right name at once ! Commander Commander Aside . That stupid fellow will spoil everything . Aloud Be quiet , my good people , you shall remain in possession of your farm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Marchioness de Sivry , to inform you that she takes the liveliest interest in your cherished daughter . Marie Marie Aside . How ?  --  but she has never seen me ! Margaret Margaret Joyfully . Do you hear that , husband ? Commander . Commander And that it will depend upon her alone to make her fortune . Marie . Marie Is it possible ? Commander . Commander As far as this farm is concerned , I am going to advise with the Marchioness about it . Her ladyship scarcely ever takes any notice of such bagatelles , and if I lay the whole matter at her heart  --  Pierrot Pierrot Touched . What a heart she must have ! Commander . Commander I am convinced that all will be satisfactorily arranged . Pierrot and Margaret . Pierrot , Margaret How fortunate ! Commander . Commander And all for the sake of your beautiful Marie . Margaret . Margaret Marie , why do n't you thank the noble gentleman ? Marie goes up to him and courtesies , after which she retires again . Commander Commander Coming in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stupid ! but , pshaw ! that do n't matter ! we 'll soon set her aright ; I understand that to perfection . Aloud , to Laroque Let all proceedings against these good people cease , and begone out of any sight ! Pierrot Pierrot I hope you will immediately accept the invitation . Laroque Laroque Bowing . Since your lorship takes such a lively interest . Retires up the stage . Pierrot Pierrot Shouting into his ear . Long live our gracious lord ! Commander Commander Terrified  --  holding his ears . Who is that bellowing animal ? Laroque Laroque He is Pierrot , my lord , a goatherd from the mountains . Commander . Commander He seems to have a well-developed organ , that goat-herd ! Young man to Pierrot follow me to the castle ! Pierrot Pierrot Aside . To the castle ?  --  what am I to do there ? Perhaps he wants to make me his butler ! Would I object ? Rubbing his hands I do n't think I would . Commander Commander Condescendingly . Adieu , my friends , adieu ! Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierrot Shouting . Long live our noble lord ! Exit Commander , Laroque and Pierrot . Margaret Margaret Extremely joyous  --  embracing Marie . Well , father ; have I not always told you that our little Marie would be our guardian angel one of these days ? Lonstalot Lonstalot Suspiciously . May Heaven please it !  --  but come , now , wife , and let us have breakfast . Exits R. Margaret Margaret Following him . Well , Marie , are you not coming ? Marie Marie Embarrassed . No , mother , it is too late  --  the sun is too high already !  --  my goats must up to the mountains ;  --  I 'll take my breakfast there , aside with Andre ! Lonstalot Lonstalot In the house . Margaret ! are you coming ! Margaret . Margaret Well , just as you like . Going I 'm coming , father  --  coming ! Exits into cottage . Marie Marie Alone . Good Andre , though you are not a fine lord , how much more would I like to be grateful to you for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , lately , when I met him in the woods . But alas ! Andre is in the same predicament that we are  --  he is poor  --  very poor . He says he possesses nothing in the world , except what his trade , with stones and mountain curiosities , will bring him ; and worse than that , he forbade me to tell any one of our meetings upon the mountains ; not even our good old priest ,  --  or even my mother . Said he was forced to hide himself between mountain cliffs for some time , and that it was a secret he could not disclose . He is now waiting for me , I am sure of it ! He will ask me , as he does every day , for a drink of goat 's milk ; then we sit down and take our breakfast together ; and then we talk !  --  Ah ! it is so nice to be with him ! and how quickly the day passes in his company ! But I stand here talking , while he will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the mountains . She wants to hurry off , and meets the Priest at the door . Aside  --  frightened Oh Heavens !  --  his reverence ! Priest . Priest Where would you go , my child ? Pause You do not answer , Marie !  --  you blush ! Well , then , let me tell you . Marie Marie Frightened . Your reverence ! Priest Priest Strictly . One day , you met some one on the mountains Marie Marie With downcast look . Yes , your reverence ! Priest . Priest Who told you , you were handsome . Marie . Marie Yes your reverence ! Priest . Priest And to-day he came into this house . Marie Marie Lively and seriously . No , indeed , your reverence , I assure you . Priest Priest Very seriously . Marie ! you have never told a falsehood ! He was here !  --  I know it . He spoke to your parents , and promised them he would interfere in their behalf with his sister , the Marchioness . Marie Marie Aside . Thank Heaven ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he only meant the Commander . Priest . Priest He gave them hopes of renewing their lease contract . The contract is signed . Marie . Marie O , what happiness ! Priest . Priest Misfortune , say I. The intentions of that gentleman are easily discernible , my good child ;  --  he wishes your ruin ! Marie . Marie My ruin ! Priest . Priest For the kindness he shows to your parents , he expects is return , the shame of their only child . Marie Marie Lively . Do not be alarmed , your reverence , I shall always know how to guard my honor . Priest . Priest I am well aware that my good Marie will withstand all temptations , but that is exactly what he is aiming at . If you do not , willingly , what he proposes , he will threaten ;  --  he will throw them into misery  --  nay , who knows  --  he may bring them into their graves . Marie . Marie Great Heavens ! Priest . Priest You see , then , my child , how well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , there is no way to escape . Marie . Marie What is to be done ? Priest Priest Lively and low . You must fly ! Marie . Marie Fly ? Priest . Priest Yes  --  to-day . In an hour from now a crowd of Savoyards will emigrate , as is customary every year , to try their fortune in Paris , and gain there the livelihood our rocky country here can not yield ; you must use the opportunity to go with them . Marie . Marie I emigrate ?  --  leave my mother ? Priest . Priest Yes , my daughter , it must be done . In the throng of so large a city as Paris , every trace of you will be lost , and , seeing you no more , he will forget you . Marie Marie Crying . Yes , your reverence , I must go  --  I will emigrate  --  but my mother  --  my poor mother !  --  oh ! my God ! Margaret Margaret In the house . Father , come ; his reverence is here . Priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's voice  --  let not your resolution be shaken by her tears  --  will you promise it , Marie ? Marie Marie Drying her eyes . I promise it , your reverence , Priest . Priest You are a brave girl , and my good daughter . Marie tries to be resolved . Margaret Margaret Entering rejoiced . Well , your reverence , has Marie told you already ? Our cottage is not to be sold ; nay , even more , the contract will be renewed by our gracious lord . Priest . Priest He might have given it to you immediately , for , to my certain knowledge , he had it signed by his sister , and carried it in his pocket . General astonishment . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Signed ?  --  what do you mean ? Priest . Priest It means  --  oh ! you deluded people  --  that all those threats  --  the attachment of your property ; this protective interposition in your behalf , was nothing but a vile conspiracy to ruin your daughter . Margaret Margaret Throwing herself upon Marie . My child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much at the beginning . Margaret . Margaret No , no ! it is impossible  --  such a villanous action ! Priest . Priest Astonishes you , poor mother ? but , for such high-born gentlemen , it is only a pastime . Lonstalot Lonstalot Who has been motionless and sullen , interrupts him . Yes , yes , his reverence is right . I now remember his smooth and sweet remarks of this morning  --  the bright fate he prophesied her , madly all the " mademoiselles " he threw around , and which even now arouse my bile ! Yes , yes , they wanted to beguile  --  to seduce her  --  those miscreants . We are only poor , low-born beggars , who have no honor to lose . Pierrot Pierrot Running in breathless . Here it is , here it is !  --  I 've got the contract renewed for the next six years , and all for Marie 's sake ; I 'm appointed game-keeper  --  all for Marie 's sake . Lonstalot Lonstalot Goes to him , and snatches the paper from his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Priest . Pierrot Pierrot Aside Jackass !  --  if that is an expression of gratitude it is not very expensive . However , I 'll pretend not to have heard it ! Margaret Margaret To the Priest . Well , your reverence ? Priest . Priest Alas ! what I have said is only too true . Marie . Marie Heavenly Father ! Margaret Margaret Frettingly . But that paper ;  --  what does it contain ? Priest . Priest Your lease , signed by the Marchioness ; and further  --  below , the appointment of your daughter as assistant in the castle . Lonstalot Lonstalot Looking at his wife . In the castle ;  --  do you mark ? Margaret Looks painfully at Marie , and draws her toward her heart . Pierrot . Pierrot In the castle ?  --  hurrah !  --  then we shall be together , and who knows , Papa Lonstalot  --  who knows but what  --  Lonstalot Lonstalot Angrily . Will you be quiet , you jackass ? Pierrot Pierrot Aside . Jackass again ? what in the world is going on here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard it . Lonstalot . Lonstalot We must refuse it all . Pierrot . Pierrot What ? Margaret . Margaret But think of our poverty . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Well , we must try to get work , as day laborers , from our neighbors , and strangers , hereabout . I have two strong arms yet , that can work for us both ; and as concerns Marie  --  Margaret Margaret In painful expectation . Well  --  Marie ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot She must depart from here . Margaret . Margaret Depart from here ?  --  oh Heavens ! Lonstalot . Lonstalot I have said it ;  --  I would rather die of hunger than live on my daughter 's shame . He tears the contract . Margaret . Margaret What are you doing , father ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot My duty . Margaret . Margaret We are lost . Lonstalot Lonstalot With decision . And Marie is saved . Margaret Margaret Going toward the Priest , who , by his silence seems to acquiesce in what Lonstalot has said . Ah , your reverence , you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you also wish me to lose my child  --  to let her go to a stranger 's land . Do you not consider that her loss will be my death ? Priest Priest Softly . Margaret , you are not alone a mother  --  you are also a Christian . Confide in Providence . A day will come when Heaven will bring your child back to your arms . Until that time arrives , she shall not be alone , nor without protection in Paris . This letter to an old , well-tried friend , will give her a protector , who will watch over her , and be with her in need and in deed Margaret Margaret The tears choking her . No , no , do not ask it of me  --  I can not part from her  --  never , never . Marie . Marie Throwing herself in her arms . Oh , my mother , do not weep . I 'll come back again  --  surely , I will return . Margaret . Margaret Do you desire it , also , Marie ?  --  you ? Ungrateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie . Marie Mother , do not speak thus  --  do not deprive me of my courage . Aside I need it . The farewell song of the Savoyards is heard in the distance , and draws nearer and nearer . After a little while they discend from the mountains , while the orchestra accompanies , very piano . CHORUS of the SAVOYARDS . Chorus " So fare you well , my dearest land . The wanderer takes his staff in hand . He e'en must go  --  or would not roam  --  So , longing , turns his looks to home . " Priest . Priest The parting hour has arrived . Margaret . Margaret Great Father in heaven ! they wish to take my child away . Lonstalot Lonstalot Decidedly . Be quiet , Marie ;  --  bid your mother farewell ;  --  in the meantime , I will arrange your things , and be back directly . Exits R. Margaret . Margaret Man !  --  father !  --  hear me ! Oh , I unfortunate mother . Hastens after Lonstalot . Marie Marie Crying . My courage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that the way you keep your promise ? Marie . Marie Ah , your reverence , I had not seen my mother 's tears then . The Savoyards come in front . The Priest hands Marie a letter , and speaks to her . Jaquot . Jacquot Well , here we are , your reverence , ready to start ; we only came to tell you good-bye , and receive your blessing . Priest . Priest I thank you , friends . Heaven 's blessing be with you . But I have a request yet to make of you . Speaks low with them , and motions to Maris . Chouchon enters . She comes running in , a large piece of bread and butter in her hand . Chouchon . Chouchon Well , here am I ; but I am not going to emigrate . No , indeed ! I remain here , her mouth full and support myself honestly . Besides , I 'm going to get married  --  to Jean Leblanc . He is not very handsome , and would do , if he was n't lame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! it 's all the same , and he 's got only one to close . I came , Marie , to ask you to be my bridesmaid . Pierrot Pierrot Sobbing . Oh yes , bridesmaid !  --  if she was n't o'er the mountains by that time ; hi-hi-hi ! Chouchon Chouchon Stupifiedly to Marie . What ? Are you going away ? Marie Marie Crying . Yes , Chouchon , I must  --  I 'll tell you why some other time . Chouchon Chouchon Crying . That 'll be a fine marriage , then , without a bridesmaid ! Marie Marie To Pierrot and Chouchon . Friends , will you promise to console my poor mother when I 'm gone ? Pierrot Pierrot Sobbing . By my soul and conscience , we will console her . Chouchon Chouchon Crying . We will console and cheer her  --  we will cry the whole day with her . Marie . Marie Do come to see her often . Pierrot Pierrot Sobbing . Every day ; and twice on Sundays . Chouchon Chouchon Sobbing . I 'll share all her meals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall see her no more No kiss of hers will awake me , when the day begins to dawn . My God ! my God ! She hides her head on the breast of the Priest . Pierrot Pierrot Crying . My heart is breaking , I feel it ! Chouchon Chouchon Chewing . So is mine !  --  so is mine ! Lonstalot and Margaret re-enter . Lonstalot enters with a stick , upon which is a bundle ; Margaret leans on him . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Well , wife , only a little courage . The devil ! do n't I remain here with you ? And I am something yet , after all . Besides , the child is not left to herself . His reverence 's friend will surely advise us of her whereabouts . He assists Margaret , who is nearly insensible , to the armchair . Marie Marie Kneeling before her . Dearest mother  --  Jaquot Jacquot To the Savoyards . Now forward , comrades ! a farewell to his reverence , and then away . We ought to be at Sallanches to-night , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , be ready . They sing chorus , " So fare you well , " etc . The Savoyards take a respectful adieu from the Priest , and move off slowly ; they are seen outside yet , to take leave of their friends , after which they move over the mountains . The singing gradually gets more and more piano , until it finishes altogether . Jaquot and two or three Savoyards remain at the door , to await Marie . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Now , Marie , your time has arrived . He gives her a sign to embrace her mother . Marie . Marie Mother , I have to leave . Margaret Margaret Rising . Oh ! only a minute yet , father  --  be merciful ! Oh ! only a minute ! I shall , perhaps , never see her again . Lonstalot Lonstalot Tenderly . Very well , then ; embrace her a few times more . I will conduct her then , until she reaches the others . He gives Jaquot a sign to go . Marie .

Thou art forced to wander far away , Defenceless and poor you wander ; Thy mother , alas , can only pray , And give thee her blessing and love . Let virtue and industry guide thee , To heaven turn thine eye ; Think of thy mother 's blessing , Which now ascends on high . God is ever just ; To him thy fate entrust . Virtue with thee ever dwell . Farewell ! farewell ! At end of song she faints , and sinks into the chair . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Now , Marie , begone  --  begone . Marie Marie In despair .

Marie . Marie Can it be true ? is it really you , Chouchon ? I can scarcely believe it , yet . I thought you happy and comfortable at home , the wife of Jean Leblanc . Chouchon . Chouchon While I have been three months in Paris , and near by . Marie . Marie But how did it happen ? Chouchon Chouchon Her mouth full . A whole suit of adventures , my dear . Well , a life full of highways and byways , experiments , motions and contre motions . Holds her plate A little more omelet , if you please . But you , my dear little Alpine rose , how did you get along ? Have you been only vegetating ? But to return to myself . First of all , you had a fine nose not to accept the place in the castle ; and it was a wise move , when you moved off altogether . Marie . Marie Is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil , my love , a cold-hearted deceiver . Marie . Marie Ah ! the good old priest well penetrated him . Chouchon . Chouchon You have no idea how he tried to tempt me : but he failed entirely . Angrily When I think of it ! Holds her plate up again A little more , if you please ! When he saw me first , he scarcely looked at me  --  and I found him so ugly , so awfully ugly  --  and yet I was mad , because he had n't looked at me at all ! The second time we met he only said , to his servant in livery : take that youthful country produce into the kitchen , and give her some breakfast . Well , you know , my dear Marie , that breakfasting was always my weak point . But how is it with you ? You do n't eat at all . Holding up her plate A little more of that steak , if you please : but not too fat . To come to my story ;  --  where was I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I mean the kitchen . Well , when I met him the third time , in the garden , I said to myself , well , he is n't such an ape , after all ; and then his fine manners , his gold chains , and fine nick-nacks , all these came into my head , and , one fine day , instead of sending me into the kitchen  --  holds up her plate give me that rest , if you please !

Chouchon He induced me to go to Paris , and , with the waiting-maids of his sister , placed me in a carriage  --  a carriage , I tell you  --  full of bolsters and satin , in which I rolled about as softly as in a feather-bed . Ah ! after all , it is a different thing to riding about in a rough , country cart , where you imagine every minute that your bones are breaking in pieces . When we arrived in Paris , the monster set me up in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fictitious name . Marie . Marie How ! You have changed your name ? Chouchon . Chouchon Yes ; and such a name , my dear !  --  such a name !  --  so distinguished and refined . They call me Ma'amselle Pagoda , at present . Marie Marie Laughing . Pagoda ? Ha-ha-ha ! Pagoda ! Chouchon Chouchon Very serious . Mademoiselle Pagoda , fashionable millinery . Sign : the old Chinaman . Works for a high nobility , respectable citizens , and the rich inhabitants of the capital . During the song Marie takes the things from the table . Song . Yes , Pagoda is now my name ; The old Chinaman 's my sign ; And so wide-spread is my fame : What a happy life is mine . For the world is new to me , And everything looks bright ; I am happy , careless , free  --  My heart is ever light . Well , then , as I said before , I am Ma'amselle Pagoda . The name was given me by that old Chinaman , the Commander . But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  pshaw , never mind . Snaps her fingers I do not care that much for all the men living , but I like to let them all suffer  --  tragic  --  let that be my revenge ! Pierrot sings and hums a little song outside What do I hear ? I ought to know that voice ! Should it be him  --  Marie . Marie Who do you mean ? Chouchon . Chouchon Why Pierrot , to be sure ! Marie . Marie Pierrot ?  --  here in Paris ? Pierrot enters , with an organ . Pierrot . Pierrot As he enters , he says . Yes , Pierrot , as large as life . Marie and Chouchon hasten to meet him : all three jump for joy . Marie . Marie Oh , Pierrot , this is glorious ! charming ! Pierrot . Pierrot Good evening , Ma'amselle Marie ; I salute you ! Good evening , Chouchon ! Marie . Marie Is it possible ? Can it really be you , good Pierrot ? Have you also left your native home ? Pierrot Pierrot Putting down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It did n't please me at home , any longer , since you all were gone ; be sides , everything wore such a different aspect . Marie . Marie How so ? Father is not sick ? and my mother , my good mother ,  --  tell me , Pierrot , is she well ? Pierrot . Pierrot They are both hearty , like the he-goats on the Alps , and so is his reverence ! They have charged me to tell you a good many things , and give you their blessing . Well , come and be blessed ! Strips his sleeves , and holds out his arms Do n't you accept ? Well , just as you like . But , listen further : the other people at home  --  holy St. Christopher !  --  became so cruelly wearisome and stupefied , and the village being as lively as my old nightcap , it infected me also , and when I became aware of it , I sold a piece of land which my uncle had left me , bought an organ , left my native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Parisian street-orchestra ! Marie . Marie But how did you find me out , good Pierrot ? Pierrot . Pierrot That has cost me a good deal of trouble . I searched and searched for you , but always in vain , until some of our countrymen told me you lived here , alone , in a garret-room ; that all over this quarter they call you " The Pearl of Savoy , " because you are so modest and handsome , and sing so sweetly . Well , here I am . But is it true , what they say of you ? Marie . Marie Well , yes , good Pierrot , I am in fashion , now . Chouchon . Chouchon Exactly like me ; I am with the fashions , too . Marie . Marie I earned enough in the last six months , to enable me to buy the little furniture you see here . Pierrot . Pierrot And to send some money to your poor parents , which you do not mention . Marie . Marie Well , it did not come all at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my only hope on the letter the good priest gave me for his friend . But he was dead before I came ; and I found myself alone , all alone , in this noisy city . Song . " When I my native land Changed for the city , None gave a friendly hand , None seemed to pity . But I sang , tra-la-la-la ! And none my voice could beat ; Yes , I sang , tra-la-la-la ! Till gold rained at my feet . " All three Chouchon , Marie , Pierrot sing : " Yes , I sang , tra-la-la-la ! etc . " Pierrot Pierrot sings . " I also now am in the field ; We can together sing . My voice , I know , to none will yield : It will for hours ring . Our song , tra-la-la-la ! Shall all the world amaze ; Our song , tra-la-la-la ! Will win us golden praise ! " All three Chouchon , Marie , Pierrot sing . " Our song , tra-la-la-la ! etc . " Marie . Marie My mother told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and God will protect and keep you in His grace . Well , you see , He has protected me . Pierrot . Pierrot Yes , Ma'amselle Marie , you are a good and decent ' girl , and our whole village shall know it . Do you stay here , now ? Marie . Marie Yes , all alone . Pierrot . Pierrot Really ! Does no one come to see you ? Marie . Marie Hesitating , and with downcast look . No  --  no one . Pierrot . Pierrot Good ; that 's right . Chouchon . Chouchon Pshaw ! I ca n't see that . That would n't please me ! Pierrot . Pierrot Consequently , Chouchon and myself are the only ones of my sex who come to see you . Upon my soul , Ma'amselle Marie , what you told me just now gives me an awful deal of pleasure , and yet , in spite of that , when I came up-stairs  --  Marie Marie Frightened . Well ? Pierrot . Pierrot I met a coxcomb , in livery , who spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie Aside . Thank heaven , ' t was not him ! Pierrot . Pierrot So that I felt rather bad here . Touching his heart . Marie Marie Aside . And yet  --  if he came . Some one gives a signal outside , by clapping his hands three times It is he ! Pierrot . Pierrot Hallo ! hallo ! What means that ? Chouchon Chouchon Aside . I know that signal ! It means as much as : begone ! Marie . Marie Aside . What shall I do ? The same signal is repeated . Pierrot . Pierrot That sounds very much like a pre-arranged signal . Chouchon . Chouchon Well , yes ; it is intended for me , and means that I shall go back to my magazine ! Pierrot . Pierrot Oh , pshaw ! Marie Marie Aside . What does she say ? Chouchon Chouchon In commanding tone , to Pierrot . And you , Pierrot , accompany me ! Pierrot . Pierrot I ? Chouchon . Chouchon And carry my band-boxes . Pierrot . Pierrot Indeed ! And who is to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over your shoulder . Adieu , Marie ; au revoir . Secretly and marked . That signal was intended for me . Pierrot Pierrot With band-boxes and organ . Heaven bless you , Mademoiselle Marie . Au revoir ; I 'll come again , soon . Chouchon . Chouchon So will I ; perhaps to breakfast . Adieu , Marie . Both exit . Marie . Marie What did Chouchon mean ? Can she suspect ?  --  Oh , no , no , that is impossible . Am I doing wrong to keep this secret from my friends ? Oh , no ; Andre is so modest  --  so tender ; I could not refuse to receive him , sometimes . Besides , have I not already known him at home ? Alas ! I could not even tell him good-bye when I left home ; it has pained me a good deal . And now , our wonderful meeting , hundreds of miles away from home , here on the stairs ; in one and the same house  --  under the same roof . Was that not an unmistakable sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , yes , Andre is my friend , my teacher , my protector , and an inner voice tells me that I am not doing wrong to confide in him . But he 's been waiting for some time : quick , let me arrange my hair and cap . So ; and now for the signal I used to give him on the Alps . Song  --  introduced . After song , Andre enters . Andre . Andre Marie , what happiness ; I was afraid you were not at home . Marie .

Andre Well , an hour per week is hardly enough . Marie . Marie When I am alone , I always repeat what you have told me . Andre Andre Rejoiced . Really , do you ? Marie Marie Lively . I mean what you teach me in my lesson Andre . Andre Well , Marie , let us converse  --  Marie . Marie Of our lesson ? Oh , with pleasure . Well , Mr. Teacher , where shall I begin ?

He is not aware of your visits . Oh , do not let him see you ; conceal yourself  --  conceal yourself  --  Andre . Andre Yes , but where ? Marie . Marie Pointing at the chamber door .

Marchioness Proudly . You will see , presently ! She goes to the C. door ; speaks to a Servant , who exits , then comes back with the Commander , who enters . The Marchioness then goes back to centre door , and speaks to the Servant again , who had come back . Marie . Marie What a proud creature ! I wonder what that fine lady wishes of me ?

You also might know her , Marchioness : why , she is the daughter of one of your subjects in Savoy  --  a man named Lonstalot ; she is a Lonstalot . He brings the Marchioness a chair . Marchioness . Marchioness Ah , indeed ? I am already known here , then ? Marie . Marie Yes , my lady . I believe I have the honor of seeing Madame the Marchioness de Sivry ? Marchioness Marchioness Aside . That strengthens my suspicions . Aloud What made you come alone to Paris , mademoiselle ? Commander . Commander Yes , mademoiselle , I should like to know that , myself . Marie . Marie The same cause that drives all our people from home  --  poverty . Commander Commander Aside . She pretends not to know me ; very clever , upon my honor . Marchioness . Marchioness But , if I am not mistaken , I renewed your ground lease , on the recommendation of my brother . I should have thought that sufficient to support you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other cause , then ? Marie . Marie There is indeed , my lady , and I will openly confess it ; looking at Commander for I can not utter a falsehood . Commander . Commander The deuce take that little simpleton  --  is she really going to tell my sister ;  --  how awkward . Marie . Marie Our Priest came one day to warn me of a danger that threatened . Commander Commander Aside . So , so  --  the Priest , was it ? Marie . Marie A powerful lord pursued me , looking at Commander until it became evident I should leave my home . Marchioness . Marchioness Rising . Enough ! And who was that gentleman ? Commander . Commander Aside . I stand upon burning coals . Marie Marie With dignity . I have forgotton his name . Commander . Commander Aside . Oh , the cunning little fox . Very well said , indeed . Motions to her his satisfaction . Marchioness .

And my talents . Marchioness . Marchioness How ?  --  this lyre ? Marie . Marie Enables me to earn sufficient for my daily wants . Marchioness Marchioness Aside . Her answer astonishes me . Have I been deceived , or is this candor dissembled to deceive me ? Commander Commander Lightly . Marchioness , I have a superb thought  --  a little grotesque , but very interesting . Is n't a great party to be given at your house to-morrow ? Marchioness Marchioness Observing Marie closely . Exactly ;  --  the betrothal of M'lle d'Elbee with my son , the Marquis Arthur de Sivry . Marie listens to it with indifference . Commander . Commander Eh bien ! this charming pearl is just now in fashion ; how would it answer to ask her to come after dinner ? Marchioness .

Commander Eh ? what is the matter ? Marchioness Marchioness Aside . If he were concealed there . Aloud Commander , though this room is small , it is clean and neat . Commander Commander Aside .

Commander Her boudoir , I suppose . Marchioness . Marchioness Let us see . Marie Marie Wishes to oppose her . Why ? madame . Marchioness Marchioness Has already opened the door , 2 E. , L.

Andre It is n't my fault ; I intended to go over the roof into my room , but the window was locked inside , so I was obliged to return over the same road ; I nearly broke my neck in the attempt . Marie . Marie But you had better go , now  --  good night . Andre Andre Coming nearer her , tenderly .

Commander and Marchioness , discovered . Marchioness . Marchioness I repeat it , Commander , the family of the Duke d'Elbee is of the purest nobility , and very much respected at Court . His sole heiress will be a splendid match for my son . This evening I think of presenting them to each other , and , as soon as etiquette allows , we shall appoint the time and hour of their betrothal . Commander . Commander And to glorify that happy event , Ma'amselle Marie , the Savoyard , will sing us her prettiest airs . Marchioness . Marchioness You do nothing , brother , but talk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Aside I will and must set my doubts at rest , this evening ! No motion of my son shall escape me , and if she has deceived me ;  --  if it is true that my son  --  then woe be to her ! Commander . Commander Ah , there is our future bridegroom  --  my handsome nephew  --  in person . It is astonishing how he favors me . Enter Arthur , C. D. Arthur . Arthur I was told , my lady , that you wished to speak to me , and I hastened to meet you . Marchioness . Marchioness Indeed , Marquis , I have to speak to you about some serious matters . Commander Commander Aside . I will use this tte-a-tte between mother and son to make all the preparations for mine . Wishes to steal away . Marchioness Marchioness Calling . Commander ! Commander Commander Returning . My lady ! Marchioness . Marchioness A chair ! Commander Commander Places chair , C. I 'll soon be obliged to apply for the position of a stable-boy ! Here is a chair . Marchioness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ? Aside , angrily . . Well , as you please . Commander throws himself on sofa . Arthur remains standing . Marchioness . Marchioness You know , my son , that when I wrote you to leave our possessions in Savoy , and to repair to Paris , I did so with the view of marrying you , and closing an alliance worthy of our name and station . Arthur . Arthur I thank you , madam , from my heart , for your motherly care . I must , however , declare , with all due respect , that such an alliance is impossible . Marchioness . Marchioness Impossible ? Commander . Commander Impossible ? Is it possible ? Arthur . Arthur Whatever lady be the object of your choice , I shall never be able to love her . Commander . Commander Nonsense ! As if any one loves his wife ! Marchioness looks at Commander . He is perplexed . Marchioness Marchioness To Arthur . And why , if I am permitted to ask ? You do not even know her ! Arthur Arthur Embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another ! Marchioness Marchioness Aside . It is true , then ! Commander . Commander What has that to do with it ? You can marry one , and love the other ! Marchioness . Marchioness Silence , Commander , you are a fool ! Commander . Commander Well , that 's pleasant , upon my word . Aside As though she loved her husband ! Arthur . Arthur Be assured , my mother , that the respect I bear you will always make me endeavor to meet your wishes , but , in this case  --  Marchioness . Marchioness Well ; well ? Arthur . Arthur Where the happiness of my life is in question , I must decline , respectfully and positively . Commander Commander Aside . Mamma will certainly shake your positiveness . Marchioness . Marchioness Well , then , Marquis , since your resolution is not to be overcome , we must needs surrender some points on our part . Are we not to know the object of your romantic attachment ? Arthur Arthur Embarrassed . My lady  --  Marchioness . Marchioness Name her without embarrassment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than that of Duchess d'Elbee , I have , like you , my son , a feeling heart , in which a mother 's affection speaks louder than the voice of ambition . I promise you my consent to every alliance , provided it be honorable . Commander . Commander Marchioness , your imposing tenderness has touched me  --  yes , upon honor  --  touched me ? Arthur . Arthur She is no marchioness . Commander . Commander Ah ! a countess , then ? Well , name the young countess ? What ?  --  no answer ! A simple baroness , perhaps ? Not even that ? My future niece must be something , sure . Marchioness . Marchioness You are right , Commander ; I can not believe my son can so far forget himself as to marry a citizen girl  --  a person without birth . Commander . Commander No  --  my nephew can not choose an unborn one . Arthur Arthur Respectful , but decided . Whatever station she may possess , I can but love her . Commander . Commander Ha-ha ! your uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marchioness rises  --  Commander removes chair . Marchioness . Marchioness Enough ; a passion which a son can not own to his mother without shame  --  a love for which one has to blush  --  does not frighten me . The family of De Sivry has never yet been ashamed of its connections . Commander . Commander Marchioness , upon honor , you were born for a minister of state . Marchioness Marchioness Proud and coldly . Marquis , the object of the party to be held to-day is known to you ;  --  I depend upon your company .  --  Your arm . Marchioness and Arthur exeunt , R. , 2 E. Commander . Commander Ah ! I am free at last . Everything goes according to my wishes . The little Alpine Rose will soon display her charms ; then the aristocratic thorn will repair to the court-call , and then  --  taking his own ear oh ! you mischievous little rascal , I know you  --  you are a master in the art of conquering , you good-for-nothing , for what else would you be a Commander . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . Commander . Commander What do I hear ?  --  a feminine voice . Can it be her ? Yes , yes , my heart knows her to be near  --  it is her  --  the charming Marie . He goes to C. D. , which opens at that moment , Chouchon appears with bandboxes ; Commander , terrified , exclaims Pagoda ! Chouchon Chouchon Surprised , lets boxes fall . Aha ! have I caught you at last , monster ? Commander . Commander I implore you , dearest Pagoda ! Chouchon Chouchon Wild . My name is not Pagoda , it is Chouchon . Commander Commander I implore you , dearest Chouchon , by all you hold sacred do not make any noise  --  avoid public scandal . Chouchon . Chouchon Aha ! Your excellency fears to compromise yourself  --  your highness fears for your honor . Where is my honor ? Is it your fault I remained a virtuous girl ? Miserable tempter , crying did you not induce me to come here , and put me in a millinery establishment ? Angrily But your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . Commander . Commander It is true .

Commander . Commander An eye  --  great Heavens ! That will be handsome , the third time we met . Have mercy  --  renounce your murderous intensions . Chouchon . Chouchon Only upon one condition . Commander . Commander What 's that , my pet ? Chouchon . Chouchon That you keep your promises . Have you not promised me that I should lead the life of a princess ? Commander . Commander Of a princess ? Chouchon . Chouchon Of a princess  --  so you told me twenty times , at least , you old tempter . Commander . Commander A theatre princess , perhaps . Chouchon . Chouchon Theatre princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , if it 's only a princess . Commander . Commander Ah ! that 's another thing  --  that may be established . Chouchon . Chouchon Certain ? Commander Commander Aside . A capital thought ;  --  the manager of the Grand Opera is my friend , and if she is once in circulation there , I am rid of her . Aloud Pagoda , in eight days you shall be in the Ballet at the Grand Opera . Chouchon . Chouchon Corps de Ballet ? I do not know that regiment , but it 's all the same , as long as its a corps . Oh ! how glad I am . SONG . Chouchon to the ballet goes . Chouchon learns to twist and bend ; Chouchon dances on her toes . Chouchon surely hearts will rend . So  --  so  --  Imitating attitudes . Chouchon winds , and Chouchon bends , When she 's dressed in silk and gauze ; Chouchon thus gains many friends , Who will give her much applause . Opera-glasses and lorgnette , Chouchon to see they 'll level , While in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So  --  so  --  Flowers fall when she appears , Chouchon looks and smiles the while ; She 'll receive so many cheers , When she 'll finish in this style ! She holds both her arms out , as if she sought for some applause . Very quickly And my style of living ! I 'll awake at eight in the morning  --  ring the bell ; they understand , and bring me three cutlets ; I eat them , then fall softly asleep again . At eleven , I rise ; I ring again ; they bring me my breakfast  --  that is my favorite meal ; I wait then until dinner  --  that is my favorite meal again ; I ring again ; they bring me maccaroni soup , with Parmesan cheese , a nice- looking pheasant , a few snipe , fricase with krout , a few roasted oysters for digestion , a piece of cheese , in remembrance of my native home , a few boiled eggs  --  Ah ! I adore eggs , but they must be freshly hatched  --  and that 's all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the Opera , then I ring again  --  Commander .

Arthur How shall I summon courage to appear before her ? what shall I tell her ? what artitice have I not made use of already to persuade her to live in this house ,  --  she having no idea that it belongs to me . Only fear of the Commander 's pursuit made her accept it . How often have I to beg her to forget the disguise in which I gained her love . I was obliged , in order to improve her mind , to make her believe her tutors were sent by my mother , who would only consent to our alliance if she showed herself worthy to be introduced to our family . Poor Marie , you are not aware that the spies of the Marchioness have discovered the hiding place where I , for the last three months , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not aware that I am forced to leave  --  to betray you  --  and that , if I do not to-day sign that hated marriage contract , in accordance with my sick mother 's request , that an order for your arrest is to be signed and executed .

Arthur Well ? and  --  Marie . Marie You always cause the poor people , who ask for charity , to be shown away ; and I should heartily wish to support them a little , especially when they are countrymen of mine . Arthur . Arthur But  --  Marie . Marie Oh , be not afraid of them recognising me ; who would know the poor Savoyard girl in this fine dress ? And if , sometimes , at the sight of a beggar , my eye drops a tear  --  well , then my hand ought to drop a charity gift ; he will take it as a proof that I possess a feeling , and perhaps bless me for it .

Arthur I must , dear Marie  --  I must . Farewell , and do not forget to avoid the window . Marie . Marie Oh no , Arthur  --  you wish it so ! Arthur presses her hand warmly , and exits quickly . Marie . Marie Dear Arthur , how I do love him , more and more ! But I keep it in my heart , or else I could not resist his sweet words ! Oh , mother , my mother ! How often do I think of you , and your protecting farewell song , to renew my strength and courage . But what means that noise ! Noise without . Enter Chouchon with 2 Servants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back . Chouchon Chouchon Elegantly dressed . So ! that will teach you to let me enter in future ! You rascals !

I still remain the same honest , lively , and well-behaved Chouchon . Oh , my child , nothing is impossible in this world . One can be a ballet-dancer , live a life full of emotions , and yet be a good girl . Only think ! I live in a great hotel , containing a dining-room , kitchen , saloons , and three antechambers ; I have two lackeys , two carriage-horses , two chambermaids , one dressing-maid , three pet poodles , one Polly , a cook , and two kitchen-boys : and yet an honest girl , for all that . Others have their gallants , so have I ; but all with honor and decency : a sort of Old Guard , who enjoy my lively temperament , and dance to music I make . Only think , my child ! I receive only persons of standing . I take my coffee with princes , my breakfast with marquises , my dinner with counts , and my supper  --  Marie . Marie Well : your supper ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marie . Marie You are happy , then ? I am glad . But as you 've made your fortune so quickly , you must have a great deal of talent for the ballet . Chouchon . Chouchon Oh , immense talent , and an immense salary . In fact they think me a very high-minded woman , and scarcely do I open my mouth , when all the world laughs . Marie . Marie I readily believe it . Chouchon . Chouchon Well , but how do you get along ? Do you know , child , that you live here like a princess , or a solo danseuse ? Alas , it seems the young Marquis is ruining himself for you ? Well , its all right , I know that . Marie . Marie The Marquis ? Nothing comes from him that you see here  --  all these are gifts of his mother , who will soon call me her daughter . Chouchon Chouchon Laughing immoderately . Ha-ha-ha ! from his mother . Ha-ha ! that is really an excellent idea . But , really , my dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commence , I 'll tell you how I found you out . Marie Marie Heartily . You have asked the Marquis 's mother , I suppose . Chouchon . Chouchon O , how stupid ! The Marquis 's mother ? We never see each other ,  --  she is not refined enough for me . Insignificantly Country nobility !  --  besides , she would have shown me the door . No ; I asked the Minister of Police , who always seems to have a particular preference to my entrechats . I told him not to show his face behind the scenes until he brought me an index of all the little fantastic chateaus of the great gentlemen . Marie . Marie Heavens ! what do you mean ? Chouchon . Chouchon Well , at my next pirouette he laid it at my feet . I searched  --  I found  --  I rang the bell  --  I came up stairs  --  I slapped the servant 's face  --  and here I am ! Marie . Marie But you are mistaken , Chouchon . Chouchon Chouchon Correcting . Ophelia , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swear to you , the Marquis  --  O , my could he have so shamefully deceived me ? Chouchon Chouchon Aside . Should she really be in ignorance ! Marie Marie Going to her toilette . This riddle must be solved immediately . I will write to him  --  yes , I 'll write to him .

Throws purse on floor You will murder your mother , for , when I return alone , and she asks for her child , I must tell her Marie is dead  --  Marie is lost . She will die ! do you hear ? She can not outlive that . Marie . Marie Father ! Clasps his knees in despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not your father ! I have no daughter ! my child is dead ! Oh , heavens , heavens , protect and support me against despair ! He throws Marie back , and rushes off . Chouchon enters . Chouchon . Chouchon What noise was that ? What is the matter here ? Marie Marie Rising slowly . My father was here . He thinks me guilty . He has repudiated me ; he has cursed me ! Chouchon . Chouchon Pshaw ! Matters will soon be arranged . Marie Marie Not listening to her . My mother ! My mother is at the point of death ! Oh , my God ! my senses are confused . Oh , my head ! my head ! Sits down at the toilette , her head in her hands . Chouchon . Chouchon Wait a bit ; my carriage is below . I will hasten after the old man , and tell him  --  Pierrot Pierrot Outside . Marie ! Mamsell Marie ! Where is she ? I must see her . Enter Pierrot , quickly . Chouchon . Chouchon Ah , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and try to quiet her ! I will hasten after the old bear , and see if I can not bring him to his senses . Exits . Pierrot . Pierrot Mamsell Marie come with me ; you must leave this house . Marie Marie Turns around . In decisive tone . Never ! My father found me here :  --  here he has repudiated me . I will remain , until Arthur leads me to the altar . When I am his wife , my father will believe my innocence , and will understand my position . Pierrot Pierrot In a marked tone . But suppose the marquis is deceiving you ! Marie Marie Coldly . Arthur deceive me ? That is impossible ! Pierrot . Pierrot Listen to me , Marie : a marriage was to have been celebrated this morning , but it was delayed ; I do n't know why , excepting , perhaps , that the parties were people of quality ;  --  they always let others wait for them , even at church ! Marie Marie Uninterestedly . Well , and  --  Pierrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening , when it is to take place in yonder church , which you can see from your window . Marie Marie Starting up , begins to understand him . From this window ? Yes , I remember , now : he forbade me to go near it . The church-bell is rung . Ah , those bells ! Pierrot . Pierrot These bells , Marie , ring for the marriage of M'lle d'Elbee with the Marquis Arthur de Sivry . Marie . Marie Arthur , Arthur ! No , no ! you are mistaken . Runs to window and tears it open I see carriages and a crowd . By the light of the torches I can discern flowers , bouquets  --  flowers everywhere . Ah ! the bride , a young cavalier , leads her by the hand . He turns around  --  he looks this way  --  Arthur  --  ah ! She falls with a shriek on ground . Pierrot Pierrot Assisting her . For Heaven sake , Marie , recollect yourself . Marie rises slowly  --  looks aghast  --  long pause . Marie . Marie Arthur ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the portrait ; goes slowly toward it No , Arthur has not left me ; see , there he is ! Pierrot . Pierrot What says she ?  --  how she stares at me . Lord of Heaven , has her reason left her ? I hear a noise without . Runs to window What do I see ?  --  three men sneaking around the garden wall  --  they are speaking low ;  --  can they have a new plot ?  --  some new knavery in their mind ? Marie has slowly sat R. during the above Marie , they come  --  do you hear , Marie , they come . Closes window carefully . Marie . Marie Yes , he comes to present me to his mother . Pierrot . Pierrot Alas ! her reason has fled . Marie , for Heaven 's sake , come ; we must fly . Marie Marie Smiling . Oh , that pretty ball  --  those handsome flowers  --  but why is Arthur not here ? I am afraid to be alone . Ah ! there he comes , and so gaily attired ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Marie  --  your bride is waiting for you ;  --  it is not that proud lady  --  let her begone  --  it is I , your Marie . The Priest is waiting at the altar  --  do not loiter longer , for to-morrow  --  to-morrow I shall be the bride of death . Marie falls back into chair . Pierrot . Pierrot They are coming  --  I hear the Commander 's voice , and , alas ! I have no means to rescue her . Marie , Marie ! Marie Marie Lost in thought , sings . God is ever just , To Him thy fate entrust . Pierrot . Pierrot Ah ! Heaven itself inspires her ! I 'll try my last scheme . Pierrot exits quickly . Marie Marie Pointing to portrait . You always remain with me , do n't you , Arthur ? always ! Pierrot plays the farewell song of Act I. on his organ , outside , and when the sounds die away in the distance , Marie follows mechanically Oh , do not go !  --  do not leave me !  --  stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woe these sounds ; I remember , it is my mother 's agony of death !  --  my mother dies ! Speaks to portrait Arthur , Arthur , my mother dies  --  my mother awaits me . Marie hastens away , still looking at the portrait . Organ very faint , and piano . ACT V.

Our young landlord , who is to be here to-day , on account of his mother 's death , has promised me a place in the castle ; besides , I have brought three hundred francs home Priest . Priest Three hundred francs ! You 've been lucky ! Jaquot . Jacquot I was n't quite so stupid as I looked , your reverence ; I knew how to take people , in Paris . I called them , first , colonel ; when that had no effect , I said general , marshal  --  it was all the same to me . One gave me a gold piece because I called him prince . Priest . Priest Well , was he not a prince ? Jaquot . Jacquot Far from it ; he was a candle-maker , and he smelled of tallow three squares off . Priest Priest Threatening , smilingly Flatterer ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fanchette Fanchette C. I have been able to save only thirty francs . Jaquot Jacquot L. Because you did n't know how to do it .

I 've made four hundred francs , Fanchette . Fanchette . Fanchette What ! four hundred francs in so short a time ? Jaquot . Jacquot He understood how to do it He took charge of the letters of old ladies to young gentlemen , and of those of old gentlemen to young ladies . That pays best ; he sometimes had six letters to the same address . Priest Priest Coming down . Well , my children , employ your earnings well , and be industrious . What a pity it is that all have not come home . To Lonstalot And our dear Marie ? Why did she not return ? You had partly promised her return to your sick wife . Lonstalot Lonstalot R.

Lonstalot Silence ! here comes my poor wife . Margaret enters from cabin . Lonstalot goes to her . Supports her How , Margaret , you up ? How imprudent ! Margaret Margaret weakly . When I awoke this morning I felt stronger and better . I was thinking , all night , that this day our emigrants would return and then I thought , my child will soon be here , or if she fails to come , the others might tell me of her . Priest Priest Aside . Poor mother ! Lonstalot Lonstalot Aside , drying a tear . If she knew our misfortune . Margaret Margaret motions Jaquot near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Jaquot .

Goes to the hill and sees Chouchon coming down . Look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady . Aside We 'll see whether a little flattery will not bring a few francs out of her pocket . Music . The Savoyards raise their hats . Enter Chouchon , down the mountain , dressed in a riding-costume ; a jockey behind her . Omnes Omnes R. C. Welcome , welcome , my lady ! Chouchon Chouchon L. Very condescendingly . Bon jour , Savoyards ! bon jour , Jaquot Jacquot Cap in hand . Heaven bless you , baroness ! Chouchon . Chouchon Ah , baroness ! He called me a baroness ! That man has wit .

I am again in my dear native home ; in the land of my ancestors and ancestoresses . I had a good deal of trouble , to be sure , to get an artistic leave of absence ! However , they must get along as well as they can , with eight graces and two muses . How my heart beats ! I had scarcely any rest until I was able to follow my dear Marie ; for here she must be . She was not to be found in Paris , in spite of my most scrutinizing inquiries . If I only find her , the blackest bread I get here will taste better than all the sweetmeats I received in Paris ! Exits into cabin . Long pause . Pierrot appears alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadly , till he gets down about the middle , when he looks around to see if Marie is following him . Then he takes the organ , and plays the farewell song . Marie appears ; as soon as she arrives in front of stage , Pierrot stops playing . Pierrot . Pierrot Thank heaven , we are here at last ! To travel these hundred of miles . Every morn , before sunrise , when I said , be ready , Marie , we 'll soon be home , she turned towards Paris , until I played that air , which , in her madness , she calls the voice of her mother . It always gave her fresh courage and strength ; every day brought me new troubles , and every day I thought : courage , courage , my brave Pierrot ,  --  there lives a Supreme Being who is now looking upon you , and at home lives a poor , sick mother , who awaits her child ! Wringing his hands Oh , heavens , her mother !  --  she lives there in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enter Lonstalot and Chouchon from cabin . Lonstalot Lonstalot To Chouchon .

Marie ! it is she ! what happiness ! Wishes to embrace her , but Marie gently thrusts her back Marie , it is I , your Chouchon ! do n't you know me ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot Heavens ! that vacant look , those pale and worn features ! Pierrot . Pierrot Yes , Father Lonstalot , you are not mistaken ; it is a poor , insane girl , I bring back to you . Lonstalot and Chouchon . Lonstalot , Chouchon Insane ! Lonstalot . Lonstalot It is the punishment of Heaven . Insane ! because she is conscience-stricken ! Pierrot . Pierrot With decision . Conscience-stricken ! who says that ? Guilty ! it is not true ! D'your hear ? it is not true ! Do you think I would have come hundreds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house ? Did you hear , Father Lonstalot ? You have slandered , you have defamed your own child , sir . Crying . Lonstalot Lonstalot Joyfully . Is it possible ? Marie , my child , innocent , pure and pious as when she left us ? Explain . Pierrot . Pierrot Roughly . Pshaw ! Explain ! is this a time ? First , nurse her well , and try to make good what you have spoiled . Lonstalot . Lonstalot And her mother , if she finds her thus . Chouchon Chouchon To Lonstalot . Wait a minute ; remain here with Marie while I go in and prepare Mother Margaret , I will tell her that home-sickness , et cetera , caused it all . The good Priest is also there , he will assist me . Exits into cabin . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Pierrot , suppose I speak to her ? Pierrot . Pierrot No  --  better wait ; let me try first . Marie  --  Marie . Marie Who calls ? Pierrot . Pierrot It is I , your friend Pierrot  --  you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but first give me something to protect me from him when he kneels at my feet . Lonstalot .

Pierrot Yes , look around ; we are at home ; you understand  --  I mean home . Marie . Marie Home . Lonstalot . Lonstalot Thank the Lord ! there is hope ! Marie . Marie Father and mother living too  --  and Chouchon ? Lonstalot . Lonstalot Oh , heaven ! Pierrot and Lonstalot in despair . Margaret , Priest , and Chouchon appear during song at the door of cabin ; the Priest and Chouchon try in vain to hold Margaret , who tremblingly walks slowly up to Marie , lays her hands upon her head , and continues the song . Margaret Margaret Singing . Think of thy mother 's blessing , Which now ascends on high ; For God is ever just  --  To Him thy fate entrust . Marie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All Saved ! saved !
