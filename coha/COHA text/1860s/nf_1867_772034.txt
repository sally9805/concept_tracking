txt THE BIBLE AND THE HOLY LAND . PATRIARCHS , KINGS , AND KINGDOMS . SCENES IN THE LIVES OF THE PATRIARCHS . The patriarchs might be called family kings  --  the divinely appointed rulers of households . They were the earliest sovereigns under God of which we have any account . Their authority was gradually extended by the union of households , whose retinue of servants was often large , and their wealth very great . The founder and leader of the patriarchal line chosen by God from the wealthy nomades , or wandering farmers of the fruitful valleys , was Abram . A worshipper of the Infinite One , he married Sarai , a maiden of elevated piety and personal beauty . And doubtless they often walked forth together beneath the nightly sky , whose transparent air in that latitude made the stars impressively  --  " The burning blazonry of God ! " Upon the hill-tops around , were the observatories and altars of Chaldean philosophy , whose disciples worshipped the host of Heaven . In the serenity of such an hour , with the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound " of the rustling forest alone breaking the stillness , it would not be strange , as they gazed on flaming Orion and the Pleiades , if they had bowed with the Devotee of Light , while  --  " Beneath his blue and beaming sky , He worshipped at their lofty shrine , And deemed he saw with gifted eye , The Godhead in his works divine . " But a purer illumination than streamed from that radiant dome , brought near in his majesty the Eternal , and like the holy worshippers of Eden , they adored with subdued and reverent hearts , their infinite Father . There is great sublimity and wonderful power in the purity and growth of religious principle , in circumstances opposed to its manifestation . The temptations resisted  --  the earnest communion with each other  --  the glorious aspirations and soarings of imagination , when morning broke upon the summits , and evening came down with its stars , and its rising moon , flooding with glory nature in her repose . These , and a thousand lovely and touching scenes of that pastoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , and bold points in character , are seized by the inspired penman as sufficient to mark the grand outline of God 's providential and moral government over the world , and his care of his people . Just when it would best accomplish his designs , which are ever marching to their fulfillment , Jehovah called to Abram , and bade him go to a distant land which he would show him . With his father-in-law , and with Lot , his flocks and herds , he journeyed toward Palestine . When he arrived at Haran , in Mesopotamia , pleased with the country , and probably influenced by the declining health of the aged Terah , he took up his residence there . Here he remained till the venerable patriarch , Sarai 's father , died . The circle of relatives bore him to the grave , and kept the days of mourning . But the dutiful daughter wept in the solitary grief of an orphan 's heart . A few years before she had lost a brother , and now the father to whom she was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who lavished his love upon her , was buried among strangers . Then the command to move forward to his promised inheritance came again to Abram . With Sarai he journeyed on among the hills , encamping at night beside a mountain spring , and beneath the unclouded heavens arching their path , changeless and watchful as the love of God  --  exiles by the power of their simple faith in him . Soon as they reached Palestine , Abram consecrated its very soil by erecting a family altar , first in the plain of Moreh , and again on the summits that catch the smile of morning near the hamlet of Bethel . Months stepped away , rapidly as silently , old associations wore off , and Abram was a wealthy and happy man in the luxuriant vales of Canaan . His flocks dotted the plains , and his cattle sent down their lowing from encircling hills . But more than these to him was the affection of his beautiful wife . Her eye watched his form along the winding way , when with the ascending sun he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serene welcome when at night-fall he returned for repose amid the sacred joys of home . At length there came on a fearful famine . The rain was withholden , and the dew shed its benediction no more upon the earth . He was compelled to seek bread at the court of Pharaoh , or perish . Knowing the power of female beauty , and the want of principle among the Egyptian princes , he was afraid of assassination and the captivity of Sarai which would follow . Haunted with this fear , he told her to say that she was his sister  --  which was not a direct falsehood , but only so by implication . According to the Jewish mode of reckoning relationship , she might be called a sister ; and Abram stooped to this prevarication under that terrible dread which , in the case of Peter , drove a true disciple of Christ to the brink of apostacy and despair . Illustration : Results of Prevarication . Peter denying his Master . But his deception involved him in the very difficulty he designed to escape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty before him . He summoned her to the apartments of the palace , and captivated by her loveliness , determined to make her his bride . During the agonizing suspense of Abram , and the concealed anguish of Sarai in her conscious degradation , the hours wore heavily away , until the judgment of God upon the royal household brought deliverance . Pharaoh , though an idolater , knew by this supernatural infliction , that there was guilt in the transaction , and called Abram to an account . He had nothing to say in self-acquittal , and with a strange magnanimity , was sent away quietly , with his wife and property , followed only by the reproaches of Pharaoh , and his own wakeful conscience . Abram returned to Palestine , became a victor in fierce battles with a vastly outnumbering foe , and was in possession of a splendid fortune . Whether in Egypt , or in his tent on the plains of Palestine , Abram , with all the patriarchs , was a true gentleman . We may doubt whether any modern school of refinement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civility in personal learning and manners , than were the rich dwellers in ancient Palestine . Subjects fell prostrate before sovereigns ; equals , when they met , inclined the head toward the breast , and placed the right hand on the left breast . Of the Great King it is written , " Come , let us bow down ; let us worship before the Lord our Maker . " Jehovah appeared to Abram in a glorious vision , talking with him as friend to friend . He fell on his face in the dust , as did the exile of Patmos ages after , while a voice of affection and hope carne from the bending sky : " I am the Almighty God ; walk before me and be thou perfect . " The solemn covenant involving the greatness and splendor of the people and commonwealth that should spring from the solitary pair , was renewed ; and as an outward seal , he was named Abraham , The father of a great multitude  --  and his wife Sarah , The princess . Still he laughed at the absurdity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blessing on Ishmael , but evidently said nothing to her upon a subject dismissed as incredible from his thoughts . For when the celestial messengers were in the tent , on their way to warn Lot , she listened to their earnest conversation , concealed by the curtains , and hearing that repeated promise based on the immutability of God , also laughed with bitter mirth at her hopeless prospect in regard to the marvelous prediction . And when one of the Angels , who was Jehovah veiled in human form , as afterward " manifest in the flesh , " charged her with this unbelief and levity , the discovery roused her fears , and approaching him , without hesitation , she denied the fact . He knew perfectly her sudden apprehension , and only repeated the accusation , enforced by a glance of omniscience , like that which pierced the heart of Peter . The group separated , and two of those bright beings went to Sodom . The next morning Abraham walked out upon the plain , and looked toward the home of Lot . He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the calm azure , from the scathed and blackened plains , where life was so busy and joyous a few hours before ! With a heavy heart he returned to his tent , arid brought Sarah forth to behold the scene . She clung with trembling to his side , while she listened to the narration of the terrible overthrow of those gorgeous cities , and the rescue of her brother 's household , and beheld in the distance the seething and silent grave of millions , sending up a swaying column of ebon cloud , like incense , to God 's burning indignation against sin . They left the vale of Mamre , and journeyed to Gera , where , with a marvellous forgetfulness of the past , the beauty of Sarah again led them into deception and falsehood , and with the same result as before . Abimelech , the king , would have taken her for his wife as Abraham 's sister , had not God appeared in a dream , threatening immediate death . Upon pleading his innocence , he was spared , and expostulating with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land ; but rebuked Sarah with merited severity . Prophecy and covenant now hastened to their fulfillment . Sarah gave birth to a son , and with the name of God upon her lips , she gave utterance to holy rapture . With all her faults , she was a pious and noble woman . She meant to train him for the Lord , and therefore when she saw young Ishmael mocking at the festival of his weaning , she besought her husband to send away the irreverent son , whose influence might ruin the consecrated Isaac . Hagar , with a generous provision for her wants , was a fugitive ; and the Most High approved the solicitude of a mother for an only child , around whose destiny was gathered the interest of ages , and the hopes of a world . And now , with the solemn shadows of life 's evening hours falling around her , and a heart subdued by the discipline of Providence , in the fulness of love which had been rising so long within the barriers of hope deferred , she bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taught him the precious name of God with the first prattle of his infant lips . How proudly she watched the unfolding of this bud of promise ! When , in the pastimes of childhood , he played before the tent door , or , with a shout of gladness , ran to meet Abraham returning from the folds , her calm and glowing eye marked his footsteps , and her grateful aspirations for a blessing on the lad , went up to the Heaven of heavens . At length he stood before her in the manliness and beauty of youth , unscarred by the rage of passions , and with a brow open and laughing as the radiant sky of his own lovely Palestine . Illustration : Hagar in the Wilderness . It was a morning which flooded the dewy plains with glory , and filled the groves with music , when Abraham came in from his wonted communion with God , and called for Isaac , and told him to prepare for a three days ' journey in the wilderness . How tenderly was Sarah regarded in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command to sacrifice the son of her old age was made to her . She might have read something fearful in the lines of anxious thought and the workings of deep emotion in the face of Abraham . But he evaded all inquiries on the subject , " clave the wood , " and accompanied by two of his young men , turned from his dwelling with a blessing from that wondering mother , and was soon lost from her straining vision among the distant hills . Upon the third day he saw the top of Mount Moriah kindling in the rising sun , and taking Isaac alone , ascended to the summit , whereon was to be reared an altar , which awakened more intense solicitude in heaven , than any offering before or since , except on Calvary , where God 's " only be-gotten and well-beloved Son " was slain . There is no higher moral sublimity than the unwavering trust and cheerful obedience of this patriarch , when the very oath of the Almighty seemed perjured , and the bow of promise blotted from the firmament of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to his assurance , though the earth had reeled in her orbit , and every star drifted from its moorings . He prayed for strength , with his hand on the forehead of his submissive son . " He rose up , and laid The wood upon the altar . All was done , He stood a moment  --  and a deep , quick flush Passed o'er his countenance ; and then he nerved His spirit with a bitter strength , and spoke  --  ' Isaac ! my only son '  --  the boy looked up , And Abraham turned his face away , and wept . ' Where is the lamb , my father ? ' O , the tones , The sweet , the thrilling music of a child ! How it doth agonize at such an hour ! It was the last , deep struggle  --  Abraham held His loved , his beautiful , his only son , And lifted up his arm , and called on God And lo ! God 's angel staid him  --  and he fell Upon his face and wept . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Isaac succeeded him to the patriarchal honors . He had two sons , Esau and Jacob . The elder brother was irreligious , and married a heathen wife . God had rejected him , and promised to Jacob the birthright ; in other words , he was to be the chief patriarch , through whose descendants the Messiah should come . He was his mother 's favorite boy , while Isaac clung to Esau . When the fond father became weak and blind from age , feeling that death was near , one day he called Esau , and told him as he might die suddenly , to get him venison , and prepare for the solemn occasion of receiving his parting blessing , which should secure the privileges and pre-eminence of the first-born . The hunter went into the fields , and Rebekah recollected that Jacob had purchased the birthright of his brother for a mess of pottage one day when he came in from the chase faint with hunger and exhaustion . She determined by a stroke of management to secure the patriarchal benediction . She sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the savory delicacy his father loved , dressed him up in Esau 's apparel , covering his hands and neck to imitate the hairiness of the rightful heir , and sent him to the beside of the dying Isaac . When the patriarch inquired who he was , he replied , " I am Esau , thy first-born . " This was beyond belief , because even the skillful hunter could scarcely , without a miracle , so soon bring in the game , and dress it for his table . Jacob was called to his side , and he felt of his hands ; the disguise completed the delusion , although his voice had the milder tone of the young shepherd to that father 's ear . He repeated the interrogation concerning his name , then embracing him , pronounced in a strain of true poetry , the perpetual blessing of Jehovah 's favor upon his undertakings , and his posterity . The stratagem had succeeded , and Jacob hastened to inform his mother of the victory , just as Esau entered . When Isaac discovered the mistake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anguish , " Bless even me also , O my father ! " That cry pierced the breaking heart of the aged man , but it was a fruitless lament , He was inflexible , and Esau wept aloud over his blasted hopes ; plotting at the same time , in his awakened enmity , the murder of Jacob . This scene of deception , disappointment , and providential working , the introductory picture brings vividly before us . The patriarchs were generally shepherds , and when we read in the Bible of shepherds , we have but a poor impression of their business , if we think only of the keeping of the small flocks kept in the fenced fields and yards of modern farmers . They made their wealth chiefly by feeding immense flocks and herds . They had extensive open plains ; and were obliged to watch the animals to prevent their being lost , stolen by robbers , or devoured by ferocious beasts . When it was at all safe , the shepherds and their flocks slept in the fields , beneath the open sky , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Wayward Son . If the country was infested by dangerous men or animals , the owners of the flocks built the fold or sheep-cote . This enclosure was sometimes merely a rude pen . The walls were of wood or stone , with a thatched roof  --  if they had any at all . The shepherd follows a wayward sheep , and brings him back to a place of safety . Thus the Good Shepherd of souls , whose disciples , like the flocks of the East , " know his voice , " with his rod of affliction restrains the wandering and keeps securely the trusting ones . Occasionally a rich land owner would make an expensive fold  --  a kind of town or fortress for his flocks . Keeping the sheep in the air , it was believed improved the texture of the wool , making it softer and firmer than when exposed to the sweating and vapors which would necessarily result from crowding them often and long into enclosures . Abraham , Isaac , and Jacob , were among the richest shepherds of antiquity , and stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have any records of the Hebrew husbandmen . The great enemy of the sheep the world over , is the wolf  --  a cunning , savage , and daring creature . A lamb of the flock seems to be a dainty feast for him . He relishes even a child ; the human delicacy is quite as delicious as the other . A mother , with three children , was once riding in a sledge in a desolate region , when a pack of wolves came running after her . She drove rapidly on , but they came nearer and nearer , until their hot breath fell on her face . In her terror , she threw one of the children to the hungry wolves , hoping thus to pacify or check them until she could get out of their reach . Soon , however , they came galloping on , surrounding her sledge , and she flung another upon the snow . A brief delay , and they were once more around her , and the last child was given to the beasts ; and then she reached her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her neighbors , an exasperated peasant hewed her down with an axe , because she fed the wolves on her own offspring , selfishly saving by the sacrifice , her own life . How like the destroyers of human virtue , and the great destroyer himself ! Wolves in sheep 's clothing , stealing upon unguarded victims , and glorying in the destruction of all that is " lovely and of good report . " for the transitory present and endless future ! We now turn to the annals of a patriarchal life which is entirely new , and intensely interesting  --  the only record of the kind in the Bible . The inspired history introduces him in the following words : " There was a man in the land of Uz , whose name was Job . " This region was in Eastern Arabia , and probably near the home of Abram when he was summoned by God to leave his idolatrous friends and neighbors in " Ur of the Chaldees . " It is thought he lived not far from the time of the great founder of the Hebrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abram 's brother . He was a devout , rich , and benevolent Gentile patriarch . The princely fortune of this " greatest of all the men of the East , " is indicated by an inventory of his flocks and herds . He had " seven thousand sheep , and three thousand camels , and five hundred yoke of oxen , and five hundred she asses . " His household was also " very great . " This mighty man was a humble servant of God ; and Satan could not bear to see his influence and prosperity ; and he determined to make him the shining mark of his enmity to God and man . The mysterious account of his entrance upon the cruel work of attempted ruin , is in the following words : " Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them . " The saints of that early age were called " Sons of God , " but the meaning seems to be that either Satan was permitted to appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministries of love , were reporting to their king , and awaiting new instructions , or , it is designed only to represent the real character and power of the tempter , in contrast with the loyalty of God 's servant . The whole narrative bears the marks of a real history ; and Jehovah is not limited by our ideas of what he can consistently do . " My ways are not your ways , nor my thoughts your thoughts , saith the Lord . " The devil charged Job with selfish motives in serving God . He could afford to be religious with such rare and splendid prosperity . To show to the universe Satan 's lying malice , his loyal subject 's holy character , and to comfort his people in all the ages following , while the discipline purified and beautified the sufferer , he told the adversary to try the patriarch with a change of circumstances  --  the severest trials ; only his body must not be touched . The gratified fiend hastened away to his attack upon the unsuspecting friend of God , over whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was large , and evidently a united and happy one . They had their anniversary festivals , which were hallowed by religious services ; the faithful and affectionate father offering sacrifices on such occasions . The Lord was recognized amid the most joyful scenes of social life ; and not , as in many prosperous households of Christian name in all the ages since , excluded from the circle of pleasure like an unwelcome , unworthy guest . Illustration : The Cruel Husbandman . The birthday seems to have been the favorite anniversary ; and at the very moment Satan left Jehovah , the children were assembled at the house of the oldest brother . Job was not there . He may have gone away for awhile , or not yet have joined the rejoicing company . For a messenger rushed into his presence with the startling intelligence that the lawless Sabeans living in the region , had fallen upon the servants keeping the oxen and asses , and slaying them , had taken the animals away . No sooner had the devil obtained permission to engage , in the wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And before the evil report was finished , another terrified , excited servant , came in , saying that the lightning of heaven had consumed the seven thousand sheep . This intelligence was falling from the lips of the only shepherd who escaped the devouring fire , when a third messenger entered , pale with alarm , and announced the raid of three companies of Chaldeans upon the keepers of the three thousand camels , killing all but the bearer of the news , and driving off the beasts of burden . The trembling man was interrupted by the sudden appearance of the fourth servant , wild with terror , crowning the crushing tidings already received , by telling Job that a gale from the wilderness had swept down upon the eldest son 's dwelling , where the whole family were , excepting the patriarch , and thrown walls and roof into a common wreck , burying his ten children under the fragments . We can not easily imagine the stunning effect of these reports , following each other like successive claps of thunder from a cloudless sky . Satan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of repining and rebellion . But how sublime the resignation of the loyal heart of the childless , homeless , and penniless sufferer ! After the eastern custom in time of affliction , he cut off his hair , rent his robe , fell upon the ground , and worshipped . The lips , tremulous with sorrow , uttered the often-quoted and beautiful words : " The Lord gave , and the Lord hath taken away ; blessed be the name of the Lord . " No disloyal act , or foolish complaint against Jehovah , gratified the expectant enemy of God and man . But Satan was not satisfied with the trial of faith . He was allowed to appear before God , and in answer to the questioning respecting the patriarch 's lofty yet meek submission , basely and meanly declared that if he had been permitted to torture the body , he should have succeeded in proving Job to be a hypocrite . The Lord had purposed to silence the devil , and thoroughly try and sanctify his own child . So he told the tempter to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suddenly poor Job was covered with burning ulcers , which defiled his form until he scraped it with a piece of broken pitcher . While sitting in the dust , a wretched mass of corruption , he found a new tempter in the person of his wife : She asked him if he could still " retain his integrity , " and urged him to " curse God and die . " Beautifully again his breaking heart uttered its loyalty . Charging her with folly , he inquired : " What ! shall we receive good at the hand of God , and shall we not receive evil ? " The scene of sorrow is now changed . Job had three friends living in the country not far off , who were clearly intelligent , noble men . They heard of his calamities , and started on a visit of condolence . When they came in sight of him , he was so changed that at first they did not know him . They wept aloud , rent their robes , and scattered dust on their heads , to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty and disease , and all around him the ruins of his just before magnificent fortune , and the bodies or graves of his sons and daughters . They approached him , and could say nothing , but sat down with him seven days and nights without speaking a word  --  an awful , expressive silence . At length Job could refrain no longer , but in his despondency , began to bewail his birth , and wish he had at least died in earliest infancy . Then was opened a long , eloquent , and wonderful discussion by the mourning company upon the providence and grace of God . Jehovah at length spake from the rolling cloud , borne on the " wings of the wind , " and indicated his dealings with a fallen race , pointing the debaters for illustrations of power , wisdom , and glory , to his works of creation , from the " crooked serpent " to " Orion and the Pleiades , " floating in the nightly sky  --  the wonders of ocean , earth , and air . Among the animals to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about which naturalists disagree  --  they can not certainly tell us what they were . These are the unicorn , supposed by many to be the rhinoceros of the present day ; the behemoth , thought to be the hippopotamus or river-horse ; and the leviathan , which answers very well to the whale . The description of the war horse is the finest ever written , and given in a few words ; and yet he had not been seen amid the wildest storm of battle , bearing his rider to the flaming mouths of ordnance , and through the leaden hail of numberless infantry arms . " Hast thou given the horse strength ? hast thou clothed his neck with thunder ? Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper ? the glory of his nostrils is terrible . He paweth in the valley , and rejoiceth in his strength , he goeth on to meet the armed men . He mocketh at fear , and is not affrighted ; neither turneth he back from the sword . The quiver rattleth against him , the glittering spear and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rage : neither believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet . He saith among the trumpets , Ha , ha ; and he smelleth the battle afar off , the thunder of the captains , and the shouting . " He alludes to a very beautiful wonder of his forming skill  --  " the treasures of the snow . " Few persons imagine the marvels of the fleecy storm that whiten the earth in winter . What a variety of perfect crystals ! and how delicate their form and finish ! The ice is made of crystals , and often gives out aeolion music at the touch of winter . Even the frost makes fine drawings on the window panes of leaves and flowers . But the people of Palestine and the regions around it , know little of our northern winters . The cold season is brief , and the occasional snow storms light , and of short duration . After God had finished his sublime appeal , Job bowed his head low before him , and declared that all he had known of him before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was no more than hearing about him ; " for , " he added , " now mine eye seeeth thee ; wherefore I abhor myself , and repent in dust and ashes . " Then the Lord rebuked Job 's friends , because they had judged him harshly , and " had multiplied words without knowledge , " directing them to offer a sacrifice for him . The patriarch prospered again under Jehovah 's smile , and became greater in wealth , and family , and influence , than he was when Satan assailed him . The deceiver and persecutor does not appear again in the annals of the devout Arabian ; disappointed and enraged , he turned his malice against others more easily conquered and led captive by his wiles . How awakening the thought that he still goes about " as a roaring lion , seeking whom he may devour . " But with loving trust in God , he can only repeat his fruitless effort to destroy , preparing the way for richest blessings . Illustration : Nathan Reproving David Illustration : David 's Charge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . KINGS . AND KINGDOMS . THE FIRST KINGS . Theocracy , we have seen , was the first form of government in the world . The word is from Theos , which means God ; for He ruled by direct command , and would have continued to have been the only and perfect sovereign , had not man been disloyal to him . The patriarchal quay , which was that of the family , having at length united households and extended authority , was still a Theocracy . When God made his people a separate nation , each of the twelve tribes , which sprang from the sons of Jacob , had its own ruler . If any important matter concerning them all demanded public attention , they called an assembly of their leaders . When the bondage in Egypt was broken , Moses was the deliverer and lawgiver of Israel , and Joshua the great general or military chieftain . The high priest was the visible servant of God  --  his representative of the Redeemer of his people . Then came the judges , who were a kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the nation , but wearing no badges of distinction . Jehovah revealed through them his will , and was still the glorious king of Israel . With the increase in numbers and general prosperity , there was a decrease of the religious element and of harmony among the people . They also ceased to appreciate the simple and sublime principles of a Theocracy , while all around them was the central power and the pomp of pagan monarchies ; and they became tired of God 's holy sovereignty , having no visible display of authority . There were dissensions and civil strife in Israel , in consequence of these departures from the Lord , and strange melancholy blindness to their preeminence over other nations . It was with them as it will be in the great American Republic , if Puritan faith and works decline , until practical atheism prevails in our " goodly land . " The people will throw off wholesome restraints , become divided North and South , and corrupt in morals , until a monarchy will be the natural resort of the people , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wonderful child of Elkanah and Hannah , given to them , like Jephthah and Samson , as a special mark of divine favor , and who early entered the temple-service under Eli , was the last of the judges , excepting the authority which he delegated to his sons . He was a noble , dutiful and devout boy , and a faithful priest and magistrate in Israel . Eli , whose sons were dissipated , and slain by God 's revealed purpose on account of their enemies , preceded him , so that Samuel saw the last of the Theocracy , and inaugurated by the Lord 's command a monarchy in Palestine . The Hebrews came to him begging for a king , and urging , as one reason for the change , the unfitness of his sons to succeed him . They were mercenary and open to bribery , and it is not strange that they were disliked by the people . It is one of many instances of departure by children from the counsels and prayers of the kindest parents , and choosing the " wages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people to God for direction in answering it . The Lord 's message was the following : " Hearken to the voice of the people in all that they say to thee : for they have not rejected thee , but they have rejected me , that I should not reign over them . According to all the works which they have done , since the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt , even to this day , wherewith they have forsaken me , and served other gods , so do they also to thee . Now , therefore , hearken to their voice : nevertheless testify solemnly to them , and show them the practice of the king that shall reign over them . " He then enumerated the burdens of the state which they must bear . The inventory of these royal exactions is so true to the experience of all countries under kingly rule , you will read it with interest . It was the first divine statement of the nature of a monarchy , and has needed no important change in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following description of the desired blessing , a king : " He will take your sons and appoint them for himself , for his chariots , and to be his horsemen ; and some shall run before his chariots . And he will appoint him captains over thousands , and captains over fifties ; and will set them to ear his ground , and to reap his harvest , and to make his instruments of war and instruments of chariots . And he will take your daughters to be confectioners , and to be cooks , and to be bakers . And he will take your fields , and your vineyards , and your olive-yards , even the best of them , and give them to his servants . And he will take the tenth of your seed , and of your vineyards , and give them to his officers , and to his servants ; and he will take your men-servants , and your maid-servants , and your goodliest young men , and your asses , and put them to his works . And he will take the tenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And ye shall cry out in that day , beware of your king which ye shall have chosen you ; and the Lord will not hear you in that day . " Illustration : Saul and the Witch of Endor . God had selected the first monarch of earth outside of heathenism . In the comparatively small tribe of Benjamin , was a man of honorable ancestry named Kish . His son , Saul , was a splendid young man , and would have attracted admiring attention anywhere , and in any land under the sun , then or since his day . He was taller from his shoulders than all the rest of Israel 's men , and possessed of the highest style of manly beauty . Repeated mention is made of his noble figure and bearing . The providential circumstances which attended his promotion were remarkable . He had wandered about for three days seeking the strayed asses of his father . Fatigued with the unsuccessful search , he was inclined to abandon it and return home , when , finding himself near Ramah , where Samuel lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Israel as a man from whom nothing was hid . Instructed in the divine designs regarding Saul , the prophet received him with honor . He assured him that the asses which he had sought were already found , and invited him to stay with him until the next morning . Saul was in fact the man on whom the divine appointment to be the first king of Israel had fallen . A hint of this high destiny produced from the astonished stranger a modest declaration of his insufficiency . But the prophet gave him the place of honor before all the persons whom  --  foreknowing the time of his arrival  - -  he had invited to his table . As is still usual in summer , Saul slept on the flat roof of the house ; and was called early in the morning by Samuel , who walked forth some way with him on his return home . When they had got beyond the town they stopped , and Samuel then anointed Saul as the person whom God had chosen to be " captain over his inheritance ; " and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the reality of these things , and to assure the mind of the bewildered young man , the prophet foretold the incidents of his homeward journey , and , in parting , desired his attendance on the seventh day following at Gilgal . On the day and at the place appointed , Samuel assembled a general convocation of the tribes for the election of a king . As usual , under the Theocracy , the choice of God was manifested by the sacred lot . The tribe of Benjamin was chosen ; and of the families of Benjamin , that of Matri was taken ; and , finally , the lot fell upon the person of Saul , the son of Kish . Anticipating this result , he had modestly concealed himself to avoid an honor which he so little desired . But he was found and brought before the people , who beheld with enthusiasm his finely developed form and preeminence in appearance , and hailed him as their king . Many prominent persons of the great tribes were jealous and indignant , because the smallest tribe , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fine figure , had been chosen . They refused to join the masses in their homage , and Saul displayed his shrewdness in " holding his peace . " And the wisdom of God was apparent in the result ; for he gradually united the discordant elements around him , and became established in power . Soon after came the trial of his ability as a general . The Ammonites , a mighty and warlike people under king Nahash , besieged the important town of Jabesh-Gilead . The beleaguered place was at length compelled to ask terms of capitulation . The proud and cruel reply was , that every man should have his right eye put out . The Jabesh-Gileadites agreed to the hard conditions , unless help reached them within seven days . Messengers hastened to Saul , in Gibeah , and found him returning from his herds in the field . The story of the invasion and peril roused all the energies and martial spirit of a king worthy of his crown . It was the Lord 's inspiration for his high office , and immediate command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaken their courage he slew oxen , had them quartered , and sent the pieces over the kingdom , assuring those who were able to fight , that unless they hastened to the rescue all their cattle should have a similar slaughter . The volunteers came pouring in , and Saul marched to Jabesh-Gilead . A battle followed , and the Ammonites were routed with terrible slaughter . It was a grand victory , and won for Saul the glory of military genius . This settled the question of his right to reign , and his sceptre was held over an undivided people . Retaining three thousand men , he followed up the conquest by an attack upon the Philistines , who had conquered on the south , and deprived Israel of weapons of war , and implements of husbandry . Only Saul and Jonathan had either sword or spear . The latter , a gifted and noble young man , distinguished himself , under God 's special benediction , in a successful assault upon a garrison of the Philistines . The enemy rallied in full strength , and Saul prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrifices to be made before the campaign was opened , and because he did not appear in Gilgal when Saul expected him , the king turned priest , and presented the offerings . This rashness revealed his undevout character and haughty self-will , which proved his ruin . Illustration : Saul Rejected . Meanwhile the most of his troops had scattered , through fear of the powerful foe . But Jonathan determined to make a bold onset , and , with his armor-bearer , climbed a high cliff , and fell upon the Philistines . They supposed the Hebrews were rushing from ambush upon them , and began to fly . Saul entered the field and aided in the overthrow of the defeated warriors , slaying and treading each other down in the wild confusion of the retreat . During the last years of Saul 's reign , conscious that God had forsaken him , in one of his campaigns against the Philistines he sought the counsel of a witch . When he beheld the vast force which the Philistine states had , by a mighty effort , brought into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind ; and now , at last , in this extremity , he sought counsel of God . But the Lord answered him not by any of the usual means  --  by dreams , by Urim , or by prophets . Finding himself thus forsaken , he had recourse to a witch at Endor , not far from Gilboa , to whom he repaired by night in disguise , and conjured her to evoke the spirit of Samuel , that he might ask counsel of him in this fearful emergency . Accordingly , an aged and mantled figure arose , which Saul took to be the ghost of Samuel , though whether it were really so or not has been much questioned . The king bowed himself reverently , and told the reason for which he had called him from the dead . The figure , in reply , told him that God had taken the crown from his house , and given it to a worthier man ; that , on the next day , the Philistines would triumph over Israel ; and that he and his sons should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these heavy tidings , but soon recovered , and , having taken some refreshment , returned the same night to the camp . The engraver 's art has produced a picture of this strange scene , one which can not be clearly and satisfactorily explained . Saul received orders , through Samuel , to execute the Lord 's " fierce wrath " upon the Amelekites , who had formerly been doomed to utter extermination , for opposing the Israelites when they came out of Egypt . The result of the war put it fully in the king 's power to fulfil his commission ; but he retained the best of the cattle as booty , and brought back the Amalekite king Agag as a prisoner . Here Saul again ventured to use his own discretion where his commission left him none . For this the divine decree , excluding his descendants from the throne , was again and irrevocably pronounced by Samuel , who met him at Gilgal on his return . The stern prophet then directed the Amalekite king to be brought forth and slain by the sword , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more to see Saul to the day of his death , though he ceased not to bemoan his misconduct , and the forfeiture it had incurred . The next engraving is a very good view of this crisis in Saul 's destiny  --  his rejection by God and his prophet . When Samuel turned to leave the king , the terrified ruler seized his mantle , and in the struggle it was torn . The prophet improved the incident by telling him that thus should his kingdom be rent from him , and given to a neighbor . We can not follow Saul through all the achievements and crimes of his eventful reign ; the abandonment of him by the grieved and indignant Samuel ; his deceptive prosperity ; and his conscious desertion by God , until his fits of depression bordered on madness . He had genius and heroism , but a bad heart , and the hour of his overthrow drew near . The venerable and gifted prophet who anointed the king was commanded by Jehovah to consecrate the successor to the throne . He was directed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sons of Jesse . He knew that should Saul be informed of the errand , his days were numbered . The doom of a traitor would follow the solemn act . To protect his servant the Lord told Samuel to offer a sacrifice , and tell the king he was going to Bethlehem for the purpose . When Samuel reached Bethlehem , he laid the offerings upon the altar , and invited a worthy citizen and his family to the sacrifice . The good man 's name was Jesse , and he had eight sons . Eliab , the eldest , like Saul , was fine-looking  --  tall , athletic , and commanding in his personal appearance . Samuel thought he must be the future king of Israel ; but God revealed to him his mistake . Six brothers followed him in their presentation to the prophet , and the Lord gave the same intimation of his will he had respecting Eliab . The man of God was perplexed . What could he do , if these were the only sons of Jesse , as it seemed , for no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly there might be another boy , and he inquired of Jesse if it were not so . The excellent father had sent the youngest son , about fifteen years old , to keep the sheep , and it did not even enter his mind that this mere child could have any thing to do with the affairs of the kingdom . He stated the facts to Samuel , who immediately desired to see the lad . He was sent for , and soon stood before the prophet . The patriarchal servant of the Infinite One looked upon the noble boy , with his " ruddy and beautiful countenance , " and saw in him the next monarch of Israel . Illustration : Christ Blessing Little Children . David stood among his brethren , a modest , bewildered shepherd boy , uninjured by unholy gratification of passion and appetite  --  a pure-minded , manly , and devout youth . God told Samuel to anoint him , and he poured the consecrating oil upon the fair brow of the astonished David . Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero , who had slain a lion and a bear , in defence of his sheep , returned to his flocks , a king in destiny . Remorse , the predictions of Samuel against him , and baleful passions , made Saul so wretchedly melancholy , that some of his attendants suggested to the monarch that he should try the soothing effect of music . The proposition was favorably received , and upon the recommendation of another friend , David , the son of Jesse , of whom Saul knew nothing before , was sent for to play upon the harp . The young minstrel won the respect and affection of the royal household , and his harpings were the principal solace of the infatuated and gloomy king , who at length made David his armor-bearer . You know the warriors of ancient time wore armor made of metal to protect the body from the spear and sword , the common weapons of the battle-field ; and men were appointed by monarchs to have the care of it . Since their last great discomfiture , the Philistines had recruited their strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the twentieth of David 's life , they again took the field against the Israelites . It curiously illustrates the nature of warfare in those times , to find that the presence , in the army of the Philistines , of one enormous giant , about nine or ten feet high , filled them with confidence , and struck the Israelites with dread . Attended by his armor-bearer , and clad in complete mail , with weapons to match his huge bulk , the giant , whose name was Goliah , presented himself daily between the two armies , and , with insulting language , defied the Israelites to produce a champion who , by single combat , might decide the quarrel between the nations . This was repeated many days ; but no Israelite was found bold enough to accept the challenge . At length David , who had come to the battle-field with food for his brethren , no longer able to endure the taunts and blasphemies of Goliah , offered himself for the combat . The king , contrasting the size and known prowess of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dissuaded him from the enterprise . But as David expressed his strong confidence that the God of Israel , who had delivered him from the lion and the bear , when he tended his father 's flock , would also deliver him from the proud Philistine , Saul at length allowed him to go forth against Goliah . Refusing all armor of proof , and weapons of common warfare , David advanced to the combat , armed only with his shepherd 's sling , and a few smooth pebbles picked up from the brook which flowed through the valley . The astonished giant felt insulted at such an opponent , and poured forth such horrid threats as might have appalled anyone less strong in faith than the son of Jesse . But as he strode forward to meet David , the latter slung one of his smooth stones with so sure an aim and so strong an arm , that it smote his opponent in the middle of the forehead , and brought him to the ground . The praises of the people lavished on David excited Saul 's jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who seemed to have a charmed life ; for God was with him , and no blow aimed at his life was successful . The king 's son , Jonathan , loved David devotedly , and more than once saved him from the wrath of Saul . After hunting the son of Jesse , consulting witches in his desperation , and fighting the Philistines in bloody conflicts , near Mount Gilboa , defeated and wounded , he committed suicide by falling on his sword . Thus ended the career of the first king of the Hebrew nation . David , under divine guidance , went to Hebron , and was there publicly anointed king by the tribe of Judah . But Abner , a splendid general , and a great friend of Saul , induced the rest of the tribes to acknowledge Ishbosheth , the only son of Saul then living , as their sovereign . Soon , however , a quarrel with his protege , led him to join David , who was at length proclaimed king by all the people . After years of prosperity in war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This occurred in the eighteenth year of his reign . The conduct of this war David intrusted to Joab , and remained himself at Jerusalem . There , while sauntering upon the roof of his palace , after the noonday sleep , which is usual in the East , he perceived a woman whose great beauty attracted his regard . She proved to be Bathsheba , the wife of Uriah , an officer of Canaanitish origin , then absent with the army besieging Rabbah , the capital of Ammon . David was so fascinated with her that he determined to add her to his royal household . He sent for Uriah to Jerusalem . Having heard from him the particulars of the war , which he pretended to require , the king dismissed him to his own home . But Uriah , feeling that it ill became a soldier to seek his bed while his companions lay on the hard ground , under the canopy of heaven , exposed to the attacks of the enemy , remained all night in the hall of the palace with the guards , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him the bearer of an order to Joab to expose him to certain death , in some perilous enterprize against the enemy . He was obeyed by that unscrupulous general ; and when David heard that Uriah was dead , he sent for Bathsheba , and made her his wife . He had already several wives , as was customary in those times ; and among them was Michal , whom he had long ago reclaimed from the man to whom she had been given by the unprincipled Saul . Illustration : The Woman of Canaan . David , whose undisputed authority , and admiration of the beautiful Bathsheba , deceived him , blinding his moral vision , thought all was safe . Death and royalty seemed to cover forever his sin . But never was a man more mistaken . God sent Nathan , a fearless , faithful prophet , to rebuke him . So the seer went to him , inquiring what should be done with a man who had robbed a poor neighbor of his only and pet lamb . The king , who was really loyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the robber should die , and the lamb be restored . Then Nathan fixed his eye on the king , and , pointing to him , exclaimed courageously , " Thou art the man ! " David bowed his head and wept under the pointed reproof , and began to cry , " Deliver me from blood-guiltiness , oh , God , thou God of my salvation . " What a fine example of faithful preaching , and of an honest hearer ! This illustration of true penitence , which is given in the picture at the beginning of this history of the kings , suggests a good story of modern date . Jacob , an intelligent negro , was bribed and intoxicated to make him commit murder . He was convicted of the crime , and sent to the State prison for life . He could not read , but a bible was in his cell , and he learned so rapidly that soon he could pick out the words and get the meaning . He would run his finger over each letter of the fifty-first Psalm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his touch . The bible is still kept by an excellent man , as a relic of prison-life . For Jacob was pardoned , went to the lovely town of C- , N.Y. , and became an eminent Christian . His monument is one of the highest in the cemetery . The Scriptures describe David as " a man after God 's own heart . " By this we are not to understand that David always acted rightly , or that God approved of all he did . Its meaning is , that , in his public capacity , as king of Israel , he acted in accordance with the true theory of the theocratical government ; was always alive to his dependence on the Supreme King ; took his own true place in the system , and aspired to no other ; and conducted all his undertakings with reference to the Supreme Will . He constantly calls himself " the servant ( or vassal ) of Jehovah , " and that , and no other , was the true place for the human king of Israel to fill . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after God 's own heart , " it is not necessary for us to vindicate all his acts , or to uphold him as an immaculate character . But the same ardent temperament which sometimes betrayed his judgment in his public acts , led him into great errors and crimes . It also made him the first to discover his lapse , and the last to forgive himself . Domestic afflictions humbled David , and persecution by enemies embittered his life . The kingly crown had its thorns . An only child died in infancy . Afterwards , his handsome and popular son , Absalom , was ambitious to get the throne of his father , and became the leader of a great revolt , in whose conflicts he was slain . Solomon , another son , was the heir chosen by the Lord , to the crown of David . And when the monarch of Israel drew near the close of his stormy , yet splendid reign , he called the intellectual , comely , and dutiful boy to his bedside , to give him his last words of counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraving . Among the paternal exhortations to the young prince was the following impressive address : " And thou , Solomon , my son , know thou the God of thy fathers , and serve him with a perfect heart , and with a willing mind ; for the Lord searcheth all hearts , and understandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts . If thou seek him , he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him , he will cast thee off forever . " Solomon , the second king of Israel , desired and sought , before riches and honors , wisdom from God , to govern well the people , and it was freely given . Under his father 's sceptre , Palestine was great in martial achievements , national wealth , and the fine arts ; for the king was a poet and a musician . Solomon was a man of peace , and during his reign the kingdom reached its highest glory in oriental splendor and luxury . The temple he built was a monument of munificence , skill , and royal zeal for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that decision in the case of the two women , one of whom , in her sleep , lying upon her babe , had smothered it , and claimed the living child of the other , who lodged with her . He knew when he sent for the executioner , and told him to cut in two parts the live babe , giving to each a half , that the mother would be seen in the effect of the command to slay . And so it was . The faithless woman said let it be so ; the loving , yearning mother exclaimed no , rather let the other have the child . Solomon wisely decided the matter , directing the attendants to give the unconscious object of controversy to her to whom it belonged . But this rich and popular monarch was led into sin by his unbounded prosperity , and indulging in forbidden pleasures . Afterwards he bitterly mourned over his folly and shameful weakness , in departing from the living God . This varied and , much of it , wasted life , led the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Book of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes , so full of the profoundest knowledge of mankind and wisest counsel . It is said that the Scotch are preeminently discerning and intelligent , because they are so familiar with the Scriptures , especially the proverbs of Solomon . There were no more such monarchs in Israel , after David and Solomon , and the kingdom became divided and weakened , until the Jews were conquered and enslaved by their enemies . The expensive magnificence and luxury of Solomon 's reign , and his departures from God into idolatrous worship , awakened the divine indignation . A prophet was commissioned to tell the wise , yet foolish monarch that the kingdom should be rent in twain , and the grandeur of his empire depart before the revolt of the ten tribes from Judah , which had absorbed the small tribe of Benjamin . Solomon was about sixty years old when he died . He had ruled forty years , and was buried nine hundred and seventy-five years before the advent of Christ . Rehoboam , the son of Solomon , was made king over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ten tribes , who were called Israel . How interesting and instructive the history of the Hebrews , at this period ! They got tired of the sovereignty of God , visible only in written rules of conduct , family government , and the prophet-judges , and desired to imitate their pagan neighbors in the pomp and power of royalty . Under their second monarch they quarrelled among themselves , engaged in civil strife , and became divided , rival kingdoms . During the five hundred years which followed , the successive kings of the two realms had , the most of them , brief sovereignty . Some of them were excellent kings , but the greater part were wicked and oppressive . Pre-eminent in crime was Ahab , whose wife , Jezebel , was a fit companion . Their names live in the world 's history with a bad preeminence , like those of Herod , Nero , and similar rulers of ancient and modern times . The corpse of a ruler , or of the humblest subject , was ordinarily wound in grave-clothes , and laid in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a room hewn out of a rock , a cave , or a grave which had no mound , nor any other mark , excepting monumental stones , with no inscriptions . The Arabian patriarch , Job , talked of kings and counsellors , who built for themselves " desolate places , " which probably has reference to sepulchral monuments , cut out of the rock . The expression " a sepulchre on high , " is an allusion to the custom anciently of placing the dead in tombs made in cliffs , sometimes hundreds of feet in height  --  a lofty , inaccessible resting-place for the body of a distinguished person . Some nations of the heathen world have always burned their dead . In Japan , recently , an American traveller witnessed this singular disposal of the lifeless remains . A priest was placed in a sitting posture in his coffin , and a fire built behind it , consuming to ashes the body . These relics were carefully gathered up , and put in a safe and sacred place for all coming time . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade or imposing ceremonies over the burial of the Hebrew kings . Of David it is written , he " slept with his fathers , and was buried in the city of David . " The same simple and impressive mention is made of Solomon 's death . Monarchs were only men  --  sinners to be saved by grace , if rescued at all from the power and ruin of sin . It is hoped and believed by Christian people that Solomon , in his declining years , reviewed prayerfully and penitently his career , and found peace with a pardoning God . The sepulchre of royalty in Jerusalem , is well worthy of a visit by travellers in the Holy Land . Some of the stone coffins lean against the solid walls , others lie in massive richness of sculpture on the floor . The Jews called their burial places the house of the living , because of the expected resurrection  --  a beautiful sentiment , which rebukes the dismal thoughts and mourning of many Christian persons over the newly made graves of their departed friends . The beautiful tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comparatively modern construction , but it shows the admiration felt by the Hebrews for Absalom , with all his waywardness . Illustration : Joseph Elevated to Power by Pharaoh . Illustration : The Israelites Carried into Captivity . THE BIBLE AND THE HOLY LAND . PATRIARCHS , KINGS AND KINGDOMS . PALESTINE UNDER PAGAN KINGS . The picture which introduces these pages was drawn from a scene under the sceptre of the first monarch mentioned in the Bible . A comparatively unimportant prince , the " King of Sodom , " whose small and wicked realm Jehovah destroyed by fire and brimstone , is mentioned . But the empire of the Pharaohs of Egypt , was large , rich , and magnificent . And it is a singular thing , that of this nation , and all others of antiquity , excepting what the Scriptures contain , the early history is little known . A great German historian , Dr. Von Rotteck , truly writes : " The principal trait that distinguishes the first period of the ancient world is its obscurity . " The general belief is , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopians from East India or South Arabia . " Where did the Indiamen have their origin ? " you may ask ; but no man can certainly answer . That all races sprang from Adam we have no doubt , but the lines of descent and emigration the wisest student of the past can not follow . The living oracles , in brief statements , give us nearly all the reliable accounts we have of the early history of the " Land of the Nile , " as Egypt was called . In them we learn that while the " chosen people of God , " the only nation whose annals of growth in the number of its population and its civilization , has been handed down to us , was no more than a tribe of wandering shepherds under Abraham , Egypt was the home of art , and a garden of agricultural products . And yet the very nomades , who roamed over the uncultivated plains , like the Aborigines of this new world , have preserved the best records of the early condition of that ancient and wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness of Pagan antiquities . It seems , from the tenth chapter of Genesis , that Egypt was settled by the descendants of Noah , through Ham , his second son . The next reference made to this remarkable country is in the twelfth chapter , where we are told of Abraham 's visit there . Again , in the twenty-first chapter , is recorded the marriage of Ishmael to an Egyptian woman . In chapter twenty-ninth is related the story of Joseph 's captivity and career in the capital of the Pagan monarchy . He was the twelfth son of Jacob , and one of Rachel 's two boys  --  lovely in his youthful character , and the idol of his father . During a period of repose in sleep he had a singular dream . The first was , that while the brothers were all in the harvest-field at work his sheaf suddenly rose upright , and the sheaves of the eleven brethren stood up and bowed to his own . The intimation that he was to rule over them made them angry , and they hated him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . The sun , moon , and eleven stars , rendered homage to him . The interpretation of this was the same as that of the other , with the addition of his father and mother , who also bowed before him . It may seem strange that Joseph should relate any thing so complimentary to himself . But he evidently did it in no boasting mood . He simply narrated the extraordinary dreams , without the least idea of what was before him . But God saw what he did hot know , that their jealousy and enmity would be overruled for the temporal salvation of the family and nation . The venerable , thoughtful father , silently pondered over the singular experience of Joseph . The elder sons were shepherds , and fed their flocks in Shechem . How beautiful the ingenious , dutiful character of Joseph now appears ! His father called him to go and find his brethren , to see how they were getting along . " Here am I , " was his response . That is to say : " Although my brethren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do any thing for them . " He went to Shechem , but they had left ; and the boy wandered about in the field looking for them . A citizen happened to see him , and was evidently interested in the beautiful stranger , bewildered and alone , and asked what he wanted . Joseph told him the truth of the case , when the man said that his brothers had taken their flocks to Dotham , a few miles distant . He started for that place , and while a " great way off , " they saw and knew him . The conspiracy was instantly formed to dispose of the " dreamer . " The first proposition was to kill him , but Reuben would not agree to the cruel suggestion . His plan was to cast the lad into a deep pit , till he could manage to get him back to his father . This less bloody way of disposing of Joseph was accepted , and when he came near they took off the " coat of many colors " the doting father had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which happened to be at hand , dipping it in blood to make his father think a beast killed him , they took it home . Scarcely was the interesting boy weeping in his prison before a caravan of Ishmaelites , and then of Midianites , came in sight . Illustration : Moses Found in the Bulrushes . A new idea now flashed upon their minds . They could avoid the unpleasant consciousness of probable murder , and make something out of his sale as a slave to the wandering traders . A bargain was soon made , and young Joseph , casting backward a farewell look of sad reproach , was carried away , and sold by the Midianites to the Ishmaelites , of whom Potiphar , the captain of Pharaoh 's guard , bought him for a servant . God blessed the youth , and he was soon made overseer of the officer 's household . But Potiphar 's wife was a vile woman , and because Joseph was nobly true to God and virtue , made a false report of him , and had him put in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his astrologers could not explain ; and a released prisoner , who had forgotten Joseph 's kindness in explaining a dream of deliverance , advised the king to send for the Hebrew . The young man was taken to the palace , and gave a true interpretation of the dreams . Pharaoh was delighted ; and from his dungeon Joseph went to the secret place of authority second to the king . Pharaoh said : " Only in the throne will I be greater than thou . " He then put a ring on his finger , a gold chain on his neck , and arrayed him in fine apparel . The beautiful illustration sets this sudden and splendid promotion before us  --  the honor God put upon his youthful servant . Soon the predicted famine came , for which the gifted and prudent Joseph had made complete provision by storing up the abundant harvests . Among the sufferers from failing crops and pasturage , was the large family of Jacob  --  his sons and their households . In their extremity they turned to Egypt . Joseph 's influence was such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The prime-minister of Egypt knew his brethren , but they had forgotten him . So he managed to find out all about his father 's house , and made his brothers bring dear Benjamin , when he wept aloud , and made himself known to them all . Pharaoh sent for the whole race , and soon the Hebrew caravan reached the fruitful land of Goshen , which was exactly suited to the life of shepherds . Here the strangers grew in numbers and wealth , until Joseph died , and the friendly monarch also . His successor cared neither for Joseph nor his countrymen . He was a tyrant , and enslaved the dwellers in Goshen . Centuries of captivity wore away , and God determined to deliver his people , and send them back again to Palestine . The scene displayed in this picture you will recognize at a glance . Moses , the Hebrew babe , afloat on the Nile , in a small boat made of bulrushes by his mother , because Pharaoh was slaying the children of her nation , to get rid of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother , nor the little voyager , thought of Moses as the future deliverer of his countrymen from bondage  --  the great leader and lawgiver of Israel . We have already had glimpses of the Hebrews in the wilderness , their progress and rulers in Palestine , after the moving multitude reached the " promised land . " The ages of changing sovereigns , and fortunes of crimes and discipline brought them at last to another mournful captivity . About six hundred years before Christ , while that wicked Manassah was king in Palestine , the monarch of Assyria  --  a grand and powerful empire  --  invaded it , and took Jerusalem . Manassah was carried in chains to Babylon , the splendid Assyrian capital . His son , Amon , became the sovereign under the Assyrian conqueror , but was soon assassinated , and Josiah took the throne . During his reign , the King of Egypt marched into Palestine and conquered it , killing Josiah , the king . A few years later , Nebuchadnezzar , the Babylonian monarch , besieged and took Jerusalem , the " City of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old was their chief protection . Those of Babylon , according to the old Roman historians , were marvelously great . Think of them rising three hundred and fifty feet , eighty-seven feet in thickness , and extending sixty miles around the city ! One writer says , that two four-horse chariots could pass each other on the top . They were built of brick , cemented together with bitumen . They had twenty gates made of solid brass , and were surmounted with two hundred and fifty towers . The city had six hundred and seventy-six squares , each over two miles in circumference . The river Euphrates flowed through the entire extent , from north to south . The hanging gardens , suspended from the walls , were gorgeous , and the public buildings rich and elegant . Such was the home of the Hebrew exiles for seventy years or more . Quintus Curtius , a Roman , has described the entrance of the great and victorious Alexander into Babylon , at a later period , who soon after died there of dissipation , while yet a young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory and pomp of this ancient capital of Babylon : Illustration : Christ Declaring Who is Greatest . " A great part of the inhabitants of Babylon stood on the walls , eager to catch a sight of their new monarch ; many went forth to meet him . Among these Bagophanes , keeper of the citadel and of the royal treasure , strewed the entire way before the king with flowers and crowns ; silver altars were also placed on both sides of the road , which were loaded not merely with frankincense , but all kinds of odoriferous herbs . He brought with him for Alexander gifts of various kinds , flocks of sheep and horses ; lions , also , and panthers were carried before him in their dens . The magi came next , singing in their usual manner their ancient hymns . After them came the Chaldeans with their musical instruments , who are not only the prophets of the Babylonians , but their artists . The first are wont to sing the praises of the kings ; the Chaldeans teach the motion of the stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last of all , the Babylonian knights , whose equipments , as well as that of their horses , showed the passion of the people for luxury . The king , Alexander , attended by armed men , having ordered the crowd of the townspeople to proceed in the rear of his infantry , entered the city in a chariot and repaired to the palace . The next day he carefully surveyed the household treasures of Darius , and all his money . For the rest , the beauty of the city and its age turned the eyes not only of the king , but of everyone in itself , and that with good reason . " The kings and conquerors of old had no canals for boats , no railways , and not many good roads . Consequently , their invasions and various public enterprises were carried forward in a slow and toilsome manner . Heavy wagons and chariots , the latter sometimes armed with scythes or long blades for battle , were the best vehicles in use . There were no monitors , nor fire-arms . Large swords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the principal weapons . The last named instrument was a massive machine with a movable beam , crowned with a very hard end , often shaped like a ram 's head , which could be thrown against a wall with tremendous force , beating it down . The catapulta , which was placed upon city walls , was a great cross-bow for hurling arrows upon an enemy . In it was combined the bow and arrow , and the sling . The mammoth arrow was put in the groove , the twisted ropes were connected with levers , and the powerful recoil would send the strong and sharp arrow a great distance . Some of the machines were large enough to discharge beams loaded with iron ; and one kind , called the balista , would send great stones , crushing through the houses on which they fell . Among the spoil , taken by Nebuchadnezzar to Babylon , were the costly vessels of the temple ; and he graced his train with members of the royal family and the principal nobles . He placed Zedekiah on the throne of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In consequence of this revolt , the Babylonian king invaded Judea with a great army , and , after taking most of the principal towns , sat down before Jerusalem . Early in the next year the Egyptians marched an army to the relief of their ally , but being intimidated by the alacrity with which the Babylonians raised the siege and advanced to give them battle , they returned home without risking an engagement . The return of the Chaldeans to the siege , destroyed all the hopes which the approach of the Egyptian succors had excited . The siege was now prosecuted with redoubled vigor ; and at length Jerusalem was taken by storm at midnight , in the eleventh year of Zedekiah , and in the eighteenth month from the commencement of the siege . Dreadful was the carnage . The people , young and old , were slaughtered wherever they appeared ; and even the temple was no refuge for them ; the sacred courts streamed with blood . Zedekiah himself , with his family and some friends , contrived to escape from the city ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jericho . He was sent in chains to Nebuchadnezzar , who had left the conclusion of the war to his generals , and was then at Riblah in Syria . After sternly reproving him for his ungrateful conduct , the conqueror ordered all the sons of Zedekiah to be slain before his eyes , and then his own eyes to be put out , thus making the slaughter of his children the last sight on which his tortured memory could dwell . He was afterward sent in fetters of brass to Babylon , where he remained until his death . Nebuchadnezzar evidently felt that his purposes had not been fully executed by the army , or else he was urged by the Edomites and others to exceed his first intentions . He therefore sent Nebuzaradan , the captain of the guard , with a sufficient force to complete the desolation of Judah and Jerusalem . He burned the city and the temple to the ground ; he collected and sent to Babylon all the gold and silver which former spoilers had left ; and he transported all the people who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor of the land , who were left to be vine-dressers and husbandmen . Four years after , Nebuzaradan again entered Judea , and gleaned a few more of the miserable inhabitants , whom he sent off to Babylon . Illustration : The Handwriting on the Wall . Thus was the land left desolate ; and thus ended the kingdom of Judah and the reign of David 's house , after it had endured four hundred and four years under twenty kings . It is remarkable that the King of Babylon made no attempt to colonize the country he had depopulated , as was done by the Assyrians in Israel ; and thus , in the providence of God , the land was left vacant , to be re-occupied by the Jews after seventy years of captivity and punishment . The grand and melancholy march into captivity is seen in the illustration of the artist . What a vast and sad procession ! The conquerors ride proudly on the high ground with the captive host in full view . The tower of Babel and the walls of their magnificent city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babylon many of their countrymen , who had been carried there in previous conquests , and were useful , respectable citizens . Among these , there was a young man of splendid abilities and noble heart , named Daniel . He was one of the youthful sons of high family , who were carried away as hostages for the fidelity of King Jehoiachin . He and some others were put under the chief eunuch , to be properly trained in the language and learning of the Chaldeans , to fit them for employments at the court . This training lasted three years , when they were examined in the presence of the king ; and Daniel and three of his friends were found to have made far greater progress than any of those who had been educated with them . They were therefore enrolled among the magians or learned men . A few years after , Nebuchadnezzar was greatly troubled with a dream , which made a profound impression upon his mind ; but the particulars of which quite passed from his memory when he awoke . Great importance was attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sciences were supposed to be able to discover their meaning . Therefore , the king sent for his court magians , and required them not only to interpret the dream , but to discover the dream itself , which he had forgotten . This they declared to be impossible ; on which the exasperated tyrant ordered all the magians to be massacred . Daniel and his friends , although not present , were included in such a sentence . On learning this , he begged a respite for the whole body , undertaking to find , through his God , the solution of the difficulty . The respite was granted ; and at the earnest prayer of Daniel , God made the secret known to him . A colossal image which the king saw , with a head of gold , arms and breast of silver , belly and thighs of brass , legs of iron , and toes partly iron and partly clay , was struck down by a stone , which itself grew and filled the whole earth . This , in the interpretation of Daniel , figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic symbols the succession of empires to the end of time ; and it is wonderful to observe how precisely the greater part of what was then future has since been accomplished . The king was not only satisfied but astonished ; he was almost ready to pay divine honors to Daniel ; and raised him at once to the eminent station of Archimagus , or chief of the magians , and governor of the metropolitan province of Babylon . His three friends , also , were at his request , promoted to places of trust and honor . Not long after , Nebuchadnezzar set up a colossal image in the plains of Dura , and commanded that , when music sounded , everyone should worship it , on pain of death . He soon learned that this command was utterly neglected by Daniel 's three friends , Shadrach , Meshach , and Abednego ; and his rage grew so high , at the example of disobedience given by persons in their high station that he ordered them to be at once cast into " the burning furnace . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who cast them in ; but they themselves remained unhurt , and not even a hair of their heads was singed . They came forth when the king called them ; and he was so much astonished and convinced by this prodigy , that he publicly acknowledged the greatness of the God whom they served . There appear to have been good and generous qualities in the character of Nebuchadnezzar ; but the pride with which he contemplated the grandeur of his empire , and the magnificence of his undertakings , was most inordinate , and he required to be taught that " the Most High ruleth over all the kingdoms of the earth , and giveth them to whomsoever he will . " He was warned of this in a dream , which was interpreted to him by Daniel ; but , neglecting the warning , " his heart was changed from man 's , and a beast 's heart was given to him . " He was afflicted with a madness which made him think himself a beast , and , acting as such , he remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In this debased and forlorn condition the mighty conqueror remained seven years , when he was restored to his reason and his throne , and one of his first acts was to issue a proclamation , humbly acknowledging the signs and wonders which the Most High God had wrought toward him , and declaring his conviction , that " those who walk in pride he is able to abase . " He died soon after . The next illustration is drawn from the interpretation of the dream in the royal palace . Conscious of Jehovah 's favor and guidance , how courageously and grandly he stands before the monarch , and declares the whole counsel of God ! He thus became a prophet of the Most High , whose wonderful career afterwards , we shall again follow , when we come to the narratives of the seers . Illustration : The vision of the Dragon Chained . The spirit alienation from God , and of depraved desires , which ruled the ancient pagan realms is set before us under various titles .

The fate of the proud kingdoms which ruled Palestine , teaches the world how little importance God attaches to human glory in his punishment of the wicked . Egypt has scarcely more than its location and name left . Its pyramids , one of which it is estimated employed three hundred thousand men twenty years in building , stand in the desert places , solitary and pillaged sepulchres . The temple of Karnak , on the east bank of the Nile , whose massive stone roof was supported by one hundred and thirty-four majestic columns , forty-three feet high , and ranged in sixteen rows ; the whole structure twelve hundred feet in length , and covered with figures of gods and heroes ; is one of the grandest works of time . Should you visit the gorges of the Theban Mountains , your feet would stumble over the bones of departed generations . Princes , priests , and warriors , after reposing thousands of years in their deep seclusion , are dragged forth by poor peasants , and scattered around the doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a torch or candle , you may wander along the rock-walled galleries several hundred feet into the heart of the summits , on each side of which are the apartments of death . Inscriptions , three thousand years old , can be distinctly traced . How little thought the Hebrews , while toiling under the shadow of palaces , or flying at night from the mighty realm of Egypt , of what we find to-day along the banks of the Nile ! The doom of Babylon , with that of the great invaders and conquerors of Palestine , is equally wonderful and instructive . Probably no nation of antiquity was more distinguished for luxury and corrupt pleasures than this unrivalled city . Its last king , Nabonnidus , reigned about one hundred years before Christ appeared ; and in less than that time afterward , the city walls enclosed a hunting ground or park for the recreation of Persian monarchs . We can not well imagine a more complete destruction than has overtaken the once rich and gay metropolis . The ruins are a number of mounds , formed of crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bitumen , and potter 's vessels . The Assyrian kings of western Asia , also invaded the Holy Land . They ruled a vast and powerful realm , whose principal city was Nineveh , to which Jonah was sent with a message from God . Sennacherib , the monarch who reigned seven hundred years before Christ , marched his armies against the cities of Judah and took them . Not satisfied with the terms of surrender he threatened further invasion . At this crisis , in answer to prayer , Jehovah sent his angel to destroy the troops ; and in one night the unseen messenger of destruction slew one hundred and eighty-five thousand men . Of this miraculous defeat a gifted but irreligious and unhappy poet has sung : And there lay the steed with his nostrils all wide , But through them there rolled not the breath of his pride ; And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf , And cold as the spray of the rock-beaten surf . And there lay the rider , distorted and pale , With the dew on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents were all silent , and the banners alone , And the lances unlifted , the trumpets unblown . And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail , And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal ; And the might of the Gentiles , unsmote by the sword , Hath melted like snow at the glance of the Lord . Now the greater part of the country which once formed Assyria , is under the sway of the Turks . Mosul , a missionary station of the American Board of Foreign Missions , is believed to mark the site of ancient Nineveh . The original inhabitants of Assyria , in modern history , are the Kurds ; a barbarous and warlike race . Some of these live in villages , and others roam over the country . They are said to resemble , in personal appearance , the Highlanders of Scotland . But the most remarkable fact in regard to the population , is the ancient church of the Nestorians , among the mountains . This Christian people have for ages maintained their independence , defying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around their mountain home . Dr. Grant , a missionary , thinks they are descendants of the " lost tribes of Israel . " We recollect to have seen in the hands of the venerable missionary , Rev. Dr. Perkins , a copy of the Scriptures preserved for many hundred years by them : sometimes hidden away , to prevent its destruction by its enemies . Not long ago , one of the Nestorian bishops , Mar Yohanah , visited this country , and attracted much attention . A Jew-like , noble man personally , and a devout Christian . But if you look on the map of Asia , you will see that Mosul and the Nestorian country is in Persia , and may wonder what it has to do with Assyria . In the conquests which weakened and divided the Assyrian empire , new kingdoms were formed ; and while none can now accurately trace the boundaries of that great monarchy , we have the later outline of Persia . More will be said of this remarkable kingdom when we come to the story of Mordecai and Esther . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no more than an ornamented arm-chair , higher than ordinary seats , with a footstool for the royal feet . Then it was made in more massive form and richly carved , with steps ascending to it . Some of the thrones were of ivory , adorned with gold ; and it is recorded , that Archelaus addressed the multitude from a throne of solid gold  --  a magnificent fortune in itself . Thus gradually the throne became the highest symbol of power , and is often applied to Jehovah 's sovereignty . He is represented as sitting upon a throne of light , and around him continually , attending angels , veiling their faces with their wings , and waiting to hear and obey his mandates ; crying with their voices of celestial music , " Holy , holy , holy , Lord God Almighty , which was and is , and is to come ! " A " crystal sea " is before this " White Throne " of a pure and just authority , and on it worships a resplendent host . Every sound and sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finest imagination picture , is ascribed to that eternal royalty . Next to the throne , the crown became a sign of authority , although it was applied , at first , to other ornaments for the head , properly called coronets , garlands , tiaras , bands , mitres , etc . The idea of a kingly crown was suggested by the diadem , which was a fillet  --  a mere band like that used to bind the long hair worn by the people  --  but richer and of a different color . It was natural and easy , with the increase of power and wealth , to make the crown a more costly and showy symbol of kingly sway . David wore a crown of gold set with jewels , he took from the king of the Ammonites . The more modern crowns of Asia , where all the kings reigned , of whom we have read in these pages , are of different shapes , and some of them very rich and expensive , ornamented with precious stones and plumes of the rarest kind . Crowns are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ; and the Christian conqueror of his sins and the world , it is written , shall have " a crown of life . " The sceptre was the third token of sovereignty . The word originally signified a staff of wood of the length of a man 's height . Later , it was smaller in form , and often plated with gold , and enriched with various decorations . Inclining , or holding out the sceptre was a mark of royal favor ; and kissing it by another , a sign of submission . Jehovah 's rule is mentioned frequently in the inspired record , under this figure . " His sceptre is a right sceptre , " in one of the declarations , which even the wicked and most wretched on account of transgression , dare not deny . Under its wide dominion are Heaven , Earth , and Hell , not only , but a universe whose boundaries neither man nor angel can ever reach . " He is God over all , and blessed forever ! " How amazing the truth of such a king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the planet wheels on its axis with startling velocity , and the insect creeps on the grain of sand . A Russian poet beautifully sung : Oh , thou Eternal One ! whose presence bright , All space doth occupy , all motion guide ! Unchanged through time 's all devastating flight , Thou only God , there is no God beside ! Being above all beings ! mighty one , Whom none can comprehend , and none explore ! Who filled existence with thyself alone ; Embracing all , supporting , ruling o'er ! Being , whom we call God , and know no more ! Thou art ! directing , guiding all . Thou art ! Direct my understanding then to thee ; Control my spirit , guide my wandering heart , Though but an atom ' mid immensity . Still I am something fashioned by thy hand ! I hold a middle rank ' twixt heaven and earth , On the last verge of mortal being stand , Close to the realms where angels have their birth , Just on the boundaries of the spirit land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though worthless our conceptions all of thee ; Yet shall thy shadowed image fill our breasts , And waft its homage to thy Deity .

And when the tongue is eloquent no more , The soul shall speak in tears of gratitude . Illustration : Ascent of Elijah . Illustration : Elisha on His Death Bed . THE BIBLE AND THE HOLY LAND PATRIARCHS , KINGS , AND KINGDOMS . HEBREW CAPTIVES ; OR , MORDECAI AND ESTHER . The next pictured scene is in the Court of Persia . It will not be forgotten that Daniel was a captive in Babylon under the last kings , and probably died there after the city was taken by Cyrus . Of this great man 's history as a captive we shall learn more when we go with the prophets of God in their peculiar mission . Nabonadrius , the son of Darius , usurped the throne after his father 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nephew of Darius , a Persian general who was occupied in foreign wars , turned his attention to the reigning monarch . He marched against the gorgeous metropolis , and besieged it for two years in vain . He at last thought of a stratagem which displayed his genius and boldness of action . He determined to turn the channel of the Euphrates , which went through the whole length of the city , from the walls where it entered , and get into the capital through the dry channel , under the massive pile which no battering rams could crumble . He succeeded in making a new bed for the stream , and his troops went into Babylon over a path washed for ages by the waters of the Euphrates . Media , a word some suppose to be derived from Madai , the son of Japheth , was the name of a region adjacent to ancient Assyria , inhabited by warlike hordes for centuries . The little that is said of these people in the Bible , is in connection with the Persians . Both seemed to have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then the Persians . But the darkness which rests upon the origin of the Asiatic lands bewilders the most careful historian . The conspicuous appearance of the Medes and Persians begins with Cyrus the Great , the conqueror of Babylon , a remarkable monarch in power , glory , and character . The picture of the magi who journeyed from the east to find the infant Messiah , presents a peculiar view of the Persians and Arabians . Among these gentile nations were men of great attainments in whatever of philosophy and astrology there was in the world . The Ethiopian race is represented , and it may have been that dark faces were over the wonderful child . Color was evidently then no honor or disgrace ; the man was the object of regard or scorn . More will be said of these wonderful travellers in the more appropriate place in the annals of Palestine . Cyrus the first , and noble Persian monarch , was kindly disposed toward the captive Jews , and Daniel had great influence over him . In the very year of his conquest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy of the Lord , and that to him he owed all kingdoms , he gave full permission to the Jews in any part of his dominions , to return to their own land and to rebuild the city and temple of Jerusalem . No sooner were the favorable dispositions of the king thus made known , than the members of the latter captivity  --  those of the tribes of Judah , Benjamin , and Levi  --  repaired in large numbers to Babylon from their different places of residence ; some to make preparations for their journey ; and others , who had no intention to return themselves , to assist those who had . Most of the existing race had been born in Babylonia , and in the course of years families had established themselves in the country , and formed connections , and gathered around them comforts which were not easily abandoned . Only a minority availed themselves of the decree in their favor ; the most of the people choosing to remain in the land of their exile ; and it has always been the opinion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Babylonia . The first return caravan was organized and directed by Zerubbabel , the grandson of king Jehoiachim , and by Jeshua , a grandson of the last high-priest Jozadak . The number of persons who joined them was about fifty thousand , including above seven thousand male and female servants . Before they departed , Cyrus restored to them the more valuable of the sacred utensils , which had been removed by Nebuchadnezzar , and preserved by his successors , and which were now to be again employed in the service of the sanctuary . Zerubbabel was also entrusted with large contributions toward the expense of rebuilding the temple , from the Jews who chose to remain behind . The beasts of burden in this caravan exceeded eight thousand . In the book of Ezra , the names of the families which returned to this first colony , and in those which followed , are carefully given . The incidents of the journey are not related . On reaching Palestine the caravan repaired at once to Jerusalem , which they found utterly ruined and desolate . Before they separated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sum by voluntary contributions toward the rebuilding of the temple . Then they employed themselves in securing dwellings and necessaries for their families ; and at the ensuing Feast of Tabernacles again repaired to Jerusalem , where sacrifices were offered on an altar erected upon the ruins of the temple . After this the people applied themselves zealously to the necessary preparation for the restoration of that edifice . In a year from the departure from Babylon , the preparations were sufficiently advanced to allow the work to be commenced ; and , accordingly , the foundations of the second temple were then laid with great rejoicings and songs of thanksgiving . While the work proceeded , the Samaritans manifested a desire to assist in the work , and to claim a community of worship in the new temple . This was declined by the Jews on the ground that the decree of the Persian king extended only to the race of Israel . Illustration : The Magi offering Presents . Being thus frustrated in their design , the Samaritans employed every means they could devise to thwart the undertaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Persian court ; and although they could not act openly against the plain decree of Cyrus , an unscrupulous use of their money and influence among the officers of the government enabled them to raise such obstructions , that the people were much discouraged , and the work proceeded but languidly , and at length was suspended altogether . From this lethargy they were roused by the exhortations and reproaches of the prophet Haggai ; and the building was resumed with fresh zeal . The new temple was dedicated with great solemnity and joy . The Jews were allowed the free exercise of their religion and laws , and the government was directed by a governor of their own nation , or by the high-priest , when there was no other governor . There was , in fact , a distinct commonwealth , with its own peculiar institutions ; and , although responsible to the Persian king , and to his deputy the governor-general of Syria , it was more secure under the protection of the monarch than it would have been in complete independence . The dreadful lesson taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temple , and the captivity of the people , had effectually cured the Jews of that tendency to idolatry which had been their ruin . But , as time went on , the distortion of character which had been restrained in one direction broke forth in another ; and although they no longer went formally astray from a religion which did not suit their depravity , they , by many vain and mischievous fancies , fabricated a religion suited to their dispositions out of the ritual to which they adhered . Early in the reign of Artaxerxes , son of the mighty Xerxes , the Hebrews went to work on the beloved city with a regular plan of its rebuilding , including an encircling wall . This king had learned by reading and traditions , the veneration which his most distinguished predecessors had shown for the God of Israel ; and about seven years after he ascended the throne , he commissioned Ezra , the priest and scribe , to take charge of the religious service at Jerusalem . And he was , in reality , the governor or viceroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so , were invited to return with him , and others who remained , were to pay contributions for the use of the temple . To this fund the king himself and his council contributed large sums of money ; and the ministers of the royal realms west of the Euphrates , were enjoined to furnish Ezra with silver , wheat , wine , oil , and salt , that the sacrifices and offerings of the temple should be constantly kept up ; all of which is said to have been done in order to avert from the king and his sons , the wrath of the God of the Hebrews , who was held in much honor at the Persian court . An exemption from all taxes was also promised to persons engaged in the service of the temple ; but this boon did not induce any of the Levitical tribe to join the caravan which assembled on the banks of the river Ahava , in Babylonia : and it was with some difficulty that Ezra at last induced some of the priestly families to go with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and fifty-four adult males  --  making , with wives and children , about six thousand persons . As a party thus composed had little military strength , and as the journey across the desert was then , as it always has been , dangerous from the Arab tribes by which it is infested , they felt considerable anxiety on this account . But Ezra , from having said much to the king of the power of God to protect and deliver those that trusted in him , felt disinclined to apply for a guard of soldiers ; and thought it better that the party should , in a solemn act of fasting and prayer , cast themselves upon the care of their God . Their confidence was rewarded by the perfect safety with which their journey was accomplished . In four months they arrived at Jerusalem . While Ezra , with his sealed commission from Artaxerxes , was urging on the noble work at Jerusalem , an unexpected danger to his people in Babylon and its provinces arose  --  a sudden and fearful crisis in destiny . Among the captives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ king , to commemorate his victorious and prosperous reign , extending from Judea to Ethiopia , and embracing a hundred and twenty-seven provinces , made a magnificent feast , which continued six months . This was to display his power and wealth , before the nobility of his realm , and representatives from the conquered provinces of his spreading empire . At the expiration of this brilliant entertainment , he gave the common people , without distinction , a feast of seven days in the court of his palace . The rich canopy and gorgeous curtains , with their fastenings  --  the tall columns , the golden couches , and tesselated floors  --  are described as " white , green , and blue hangings , fastened with cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings , and pillars of marble : the beds were of gold and silver , upon a pavement of red , and blue , and black , and white marble . " Illustration : Our Saviour Teaching in the Temple . Of this grandeur , in the ashes strewn by wasting ages , are imposing remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mutilated columns of the magnificent colonnades , " where youth and beauty graced the harems of Persian monarchs . Upon this occasion , the queen had a private pavilion for her female guests . But during the successive days of dissipation , the mirth waxed loud in the apartments of the king . The flashing goblet circulated freely , and his brain became wild with " wine and wassail . " As the crowning display of his glory , Vashti , in her jeweled robes and diadem , must grace the banquet . The command was issued , and the messenger sent . This mandate , requiring what at any time was contrary to custom , the appearance of a woman , unveiled , in an assemblage of men , now when revelry and riot betrayed the royal intoxication , overwhelmed the queen with surprise . A thousand wondering and beaming eyes were upon her during the brief pause before answering the summons . Her proud refusal to appear , roused the fury of Ahashuerus , already mad with excitement . It would not answer to pass by the indignity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his court , and the news of his sullied honor would reach every dwelling in his realm , and curl the lip of the serf with scorn . The nobles fanned the flame of his indignation . Unless a withering rebuke were administered , their authority as husbands would be gone , and the caprice of woman make every family a scene of daily revolution . Vashti was divorced  --  and to provide for the emergency , his courtiers suggested that he should collect in his harem all the beautiful virgins of the land , and choose him a wife . Among these was Hadassah , the adopted daughter of Mordecai . He urged her to enter her name among the rivals for kingly favor . It was not ambition merely that moved Mordecai . He had been meditating upon the unfolding providence of God toward his scattered nation , and felt that there was deeper meaning in passing events than the pleasures and anger of his sovereign . Arrayed richly as circumstances would permit , the beautiful Jewess , concealing her lineage , joined the youthful procession that entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to look along the rank of female beauty , floating like a vision before him . The character of Esther is here exhibited at the outset ; for when she went into the presence of the king , for his inspection , instead of asking for gifts as allowed by him , and as the others did , she took only what the chamberlain gave her . Of exquisite form and faultless features , her rare beauty at once captivated the king , and he made her his wife . Mordecai was a man of a noble heart , grand intellect , and unwavering integrity ; there was nevertheless an air of severity about him  --  a haughty , unbending spirit ; which with his high sense of honor and scorn of meanness would prompt him to lead an isolated life . We have sometimes thought that even he had not been able to resist the fascinations of his young and beautiful cousin , and that the effort to conceal his feelings had given a greater severity to his manner than he naturally possessed . Too noble , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his own , when a throne was offered her ; or perceiving that the lovely and gentle being he had seen ripen into faultless womanhood could never return his love  --  indeed , could cherish no feeling but that of a fond daughter , he crushed by his strong will his fruitless passion . In no other way can I account for the life he led , lingering forever around the palace gates , where now and then he might get a glimpse of her who had been the light of his soul , the one bright bird which had cheered his exile 's home . That home he wished no longer to see , and day after day he took his old station at the gates of Shushan , and looked upon the magnificent walls that divided him from all that had made life desirable . It seems also as if some latent fear that Haman , the favorite of the king  --  younger than his master , and of vast ambition , might attempt to exert too great an influence over his cousin , must have prompted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that homage which was his due . No reason is given for the hostility he manifested , and which he must have known would end in his own destruction . Whenever Haman , with his retinue , came from the palace , all paid him the reverence due to the king 's favorite but Mordecai , who sat like a statue , not even turning his head to notice him . He acted like one tired of life , and at length succeeded in arousing the deadly hostility of the haughty minister . The latter , however , scorning to be revenged on one man , and he a person of low birth , persuaded the king to decree the slaughter of all the Jews in his realm . The news fell like a thunderbolt on Mordecai . Sullen , proud , and indifferent to his own fate , he had defied his enemy to do his worst ; but such a savage vengeance had never entered his mind , It was too late , however , to regret his behavior . Right or wrong , he had been the cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avert the awful catastrophe . With rent garments , and sackcloth on his head , he travelled the city with a loud and bitter cry , and his voice rang even over the walls of the palace , in tones that startled its slumbering inmates . Illustration : Humility Exemplified  --  Giving Alms in Secret . It was told Esther , and she ordered garments to be given him , but he refused to receive them , and sent back a copy of the king 's decree , respecting the massacre of the Jews , and bade her go in and supplicate him to remit the sentence . She replied that it was certain death to enter the king 's presence unbidden , unless he chose to hold out his sceptre ; and that for a whole month he had not requested to see her . Her stern cousin , however , unmoved by the danger to herself , and thinking only of his people , replied haughtily that she might do as she chose ; if she preferred to save herself , delivery would come to the Jews from some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment the character of Esther unfolds itself . It was only a passing weakness that prompted her to put in a word for her own life , and she at once rose to the dignity of a martyr . The blood of the proud and heroic Mordecai flowed in her veins , and she said : " Go , tell my cousin to assemble all the Jews in Shushan , and fast three days and three nights , neither eating nor drinking ; I and my maidens will do the same , and on the third day I will go before the king , and if I perish , I perish ! " Noble and brave heart ! death  --  a violent death  --  is terrible ; but thou art equal . There , in that magnificent apartment , filled with perfume , and where the softened light , stealing through the gorgeous windows by day , and shed from golden lamps by night on marble columns and golden-colored couches , makes a scene of enchantment , behold Esther , with her royal apparel thrown aside , kneeling on the tesselated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither eating nor drinking , while hunger , and thirst , and mental agony have made fearful inroads on her beauty . Her cheeks are sunken and haggard  --  her large and lustrous eyes dim with weeping , and her lips parched and dry , yet ever moving in inward prayer . Mental and physical suffering have crushed her young heart within her , and now the hour of her destiny is approaching . Ah ! who can tell the desperate effort it required to prepare for that terrible interview . Never before did it become her to look so fascinating as then ; and removing with tremulous anxiety the traces of her suffering , she decked herself in the most becoming apparel she could select . Her long black tresses were never before so carefully braided over her polished forehead , and never before did she put forth such an effort to enhance every charm , and make her beauty irresistible to the king . At length , fully arrayed and looking more like a goddess dropped from the clouds , than a being of clay , she stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the threshold to swallow down the choking sensation that almost suffocated her , and to gather her failing strength , she passed slowly into the room , while her maidens stood breathless without , listening , and waiting with the intensest anxiety the issue . Hearing a slight rustling , the king , with a sudden frown , looked up to see who was so sick of life as to dare to come unbidden in his presence , and lo ! Esther stood speechless before him . Her long fastings and watchings had taken the color from her cheeks , but had given a greater transparency in its place , and as she stood , half shrinking , with the shadow of profound melancholy on her pallid , but indescribably beautiful countenance , her pencilled brow slightly contracted in the intensity of her excitement , her long lashes dripping in tears , and lips trembling with agitation ; she was , though silent , in herself an appeal that a heart of stone could not resist . The monarch gazed long and silently on her , as she stood waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden sceptre slowly rises and points to her . The beautiful intruder is welcome , and sinks like a snow wreath at his feet . Never before did the monarch gaze on such transcendent loveliness ; and spell-bound and conquered by it , he said , in a gentle voice : " What wilt thou , Queen Esther ? What is thy request ? It shall be granted thee , even to the half of my kingdom ! " Woman-like , she did not wish to risk the influence she had suddenly gained , by asking the destruction of his favorite , and the reversion of his unalterable decree , and so she prayed only that he and Haman might banquet with her the next day . She had thrown her fetters over him , and was determined to fascinate him still more deeply before she ventured on so bold a movement . At the banquet he again asked her what she desired , for he well knew that it was no ordinary matter that had induced her to peril her life by entering unbidden his presence . She invited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third . But the night previous to the last , the king could not sleep , and after tossing awhile on his troubled couch , he called for the record of the court , and there found that Mordecai had a short time before informed him through the queen , of an attempt to assassinate him , and no reward been bestowed . The next day , therefore , he made Haman perform the humiliating office of leading his enemy in triumph through the streets , proclaiming before him : " This is the man whom the king delighteth to honor . " As he passed by the gallows he had the day before erected for that very man , a shudder crept through his frame , and the first omen of coming evil cast its shadow on his spirit . Illustration : Herod 's Cruel Massacre . The way was now clear to Esther , and so the next day , at the banquet , as the king repeated his former offer , she , reclining on the couch , her chiseled form and ravishing beauty inflaming the ardent monarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I ask , O king , for my life , and that of my people . If we had all been sold as bondmen and bondwomen , I had held my tongue , great as the evil would have been to thee . " The king started , as if stung by an adder , and with a brow dark as wrath , and a voice that sent Haman to his feet , exclaimed : " Thy life ! my queen ? Who is he ? where is he that dare even harbor such a thought in his heart ? He who strikes at thy life , radiant creature , plants his presumptuous blow on his monarch 's bosom . " " That man , " said the lovely pleader , " is the wicked Haman . " Darting one look of vengeance on the petrified favorite , he strode forth into the garden to control his boiling passions . Haman saw at once that his only hope now was in moving the sympathies of the queen in his behalf ; and approaching her , he began to plead most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the couch where she lay , and while in this position the king returned . " What ! " he exclaimed , " will he violate the queen here in my own palace ! " Nothing more was said ; no order was given . The look and voice of terrible wrath in which this was said , were sufficient . The attendants simply spread a cloth over Haman 's face , and not a word was spoken . Those who came in , when they saw the covered countenance , knew the import . It was the sentence of death . The vaulting favorite himself dare not remove it  --  he must die , and the quicker the agony is over , the better . In a few hours he was swinging on the gallows he had erected for Mordecai . After this , the queen 's power was supreme  --  every thing she asked was granted . To please her he let his palace flow in the blood of five hundred of his subjects , whom the Jews slew in self-defence . For her he hung Haman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them . For her he made Mordecai prime minister , and lavished boundless favors on the hitherto oppressed Hebrews . And right worthy was she of all he did for her . Lovely in character as she was in person , her sudden elevation did not make her vain , nor her power haughty . The same gentle , pure , and noble creature when queen , as when living in the lowly habitation of her cousin , generous , disinterested , and ready to die for others , she is one of the loveliest characters furnished in the annals of history . It is a little singular that the words , God or Providence , are not mentioned in the whole book of Esther . The writer seems studiously to have avoided any reference to them , as if he did not wish to recognize the interposition of Heaven in any of the events that transpired ; while his narrative is evidently designed to teach nothing else . The hand of Providence is everywhere seen managing the whole scheme . But the greatest acts of Providence awaken the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when some great occurrence meets us , but overlook the vast effects which follow causes that attracted no eye but God 's . We see the flying timbers and flaming ruins of a conflagration , and forget that a concealed spark did it all . A noble mind and body are wrecked , and many weep ; yet how few think that the blast of moral ruin which stranded the life-bark , was once the quiet breath of a mother 's unholy influence leading the boy astray . So the splendid career of a hero and patriot , like Mordecai , Moses , or Washington , is less glorious than the simple decision made amid the conflicting emotions of youthful aspiration to honor God and serve a struggling country . Jehovah illustrates this principle in all his administration . What to Elijah on the solemn mount was the sweep of the hurricane , rending the cliffs and tossing rocks like withered leaves in air  --  the thunder of the earthquake 's march  --  the blinding glow of the mantling flame  --  compared to the " still small voice " that thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not strange that there is to be a reckoning for " idle words " even , for they have shaken the world , and their echo will never die away . Their mutual love and devout character , remind us of the affectionate fidelity to each other and to God , of Ruth the Moabitess , and her Hebrew mother-in-law Naomi , who lived in the time of the Judges . Naomi 's family were self-exiled on account of famine in Palestine . Ruth had married a man of Moab ; but he and her father-in-law died . A sister whose husband was brother to her own , was also a widow ; and when Naomi determined to return to her native land , at her request , Orphah sought her people and friends . Ruth would not leave the pilgrim to the Holy Land . Embracing Naomi , she said : " Entreat me not to leave thee , for where thou goest I will go , and where thou lodgest , I will lodge : thy people shall be mine , and thy God my God : where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be buried : naught but death shall part us . " Beautiful and brave heart ! home , and friends , and wealth , nay , the gods she had been taught to worship , were all forgotten in the warmth of her affection . Tearful yet firm , " Entreat me not to leave thee , " she said . " I care not for the future ; I can bear the worst ; and when thou art taken from me , I will linger around thy grave till I die , and then the stranger shall lay me by thy side ! " What could Naomi do but fold the beautiful being to her bosom and be silent , except as tears gave utterance to her emotions . Such a heart outweighs the treasures of the world , and such absorbing love , truth , and virtue , make all the accomplishments of life appear worthless in comparison . God blessed their devotion to him and each other , giving his special tokens of favor to the young heroine from Moab . Upon reaching Bethlehem , she went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wealthy citizen , to glean after the reapers . He inquired after her , became interested in her , and , remembering his obligations on account of their relationship , married her . An honorable portion and plenty crowned the homeless wanderings of Ruth and Naomi , as they did the captivity of Mordecai and Esther . About two hundred years after the death of the latter , the Hebrew Scriptures were translated into Greek by the order of Ptolemy Philadelphus , the Egyptian sovereign of Palestine , making the famous Septuagint  --  the name probably referring to seventy-two persons engaged on the work . A little over two centuries passed , and the Roman armies began their conquests in Asia . Less than a score of years later Herod the Great governed Judea , under the Roman emperor . This Herod , whose reign closed the ancient annals of Palestine , was an Edomite  --  a cruel and ambitious man . Less than thirty years passed , and one of the darkest , bloodiest acts of any sovereign since time began , disgraced the reign of Herod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distant east , inquiring for a new-born king , saying that they had seen " his star , " and had come to offer him their gifts and homage . They found him in the manger at Bethlehem : and then repaired to their own country without returning to Jerusalem , as Herod had desired . The jealousy of that tyrant had been awakened by their inquiry for the " King of the Jews ; " and as their neglect to return prevented him from distinguishing the object of their homage , he had the inconceivable barbarity to order that all the children in Bethlehem under two years of age should be put to death , trusting that the intended victim would fall in the general slaughter ; but Joseph had previously been warned in a dream to take his wife and the infant to the land of Egypt , whence they did not return till after the death of Herod . That event was not long delayed . In the sixty-ninth year of his age . Herod fell ill of the disease which occasioned his death . That disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the most cruel tortures , but rendered him altogether loathsome to himself and others . The natural ferocity of his temper could not be tamed by such experience . Knowing that the nation would little regret his death , he ordered the persons of chief note to be confined in a tower , and all of them to be slain when his own death took place , that there might be cause for weeping in Jerusalem . This savage order was not executed . After a reign of thirty-seven years , Herod died In the seventieth year of his age . Sir Walter Scott 's beautiful " Hebrew Hymn " will fittingly close these sketches of Palestine : When Israel , of the Lord beloved , Out from the land of bondage came , Her father 's God before her moved , An awful guide , in smoke and flame . By day along the astonished lands , The cloudy pillar glided slow ; By night Arabia 's crimsoned sands Returned the fiery columns ' glow . There rose the choral hymn of praise , And trump and timbrel answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With priests ' and warriors ' voice between . No portents now our foes amaze , Forsaken Israel wanders lone ; Our fathers would not know Thy ways , And Thou has left them to their own . But present still , though now unseen , When brightly shines the prosperous day , Be thoughts of Thee , a cloudy screen , To temper the deceitful ray . And oh ! when stoops on Judah 's path , In shade and storm , the frequent night , Be Thou long-suffering , slow to wrath , A burning and a shining light . Our harps we left by Babel 's streams , The tyrant 's jest , the Gentile 's scorn , No censer round our altar beams , And mute our timbrel , trump , and horn , But thou hast said , " The blood of goat , The flesh of rams I will not prize , A contrite heart , an humble thought , Are more accepted sacrifice .
