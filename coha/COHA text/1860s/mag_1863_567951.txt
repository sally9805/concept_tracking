ARTICLE JV. - FINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE REBELLION . OF the many Southern delusions which the present war is destined , we trust , to dissipate forever , none is more remarkable than the expectations of utter financial ruin at the North , which secession was to accomplish . Northern industry was to be paralyzed ; Northern looms were to be stopped ; Northern ships were to rot at the wharves ; Northern merchants and banks were to suspend payment . The crowd of greedy Northern parasites , which had long fattened upon Southern wealth , were to be ejected forever from their posts and deprived of their ill-gotten gains . Universal bankruptcy and general impoverishment would break up the foundations of social order . Anarchy would reign in Northern cities , and grass would grow in their streets . Such absurdities are the legitimate fruit of those false social , political , and economical theories , which claim for a single product the monopoly of wealth , and for a small privileged class the monopoly of liberty and power ; in other words , the two great Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cotton is Kino " and Slavery is the " cornerstone " of the highest civilization . In a certain limited sense cotton is King ; not absolutely , like food or metals , which we must have , but as it were during good behavior . In other words , so long as cotton furnishes the best and cheapest material for certain necessary purposes , it will be used for those purposes . When it ceases to be such a material , others will take its place , or new fields will be found for its production , or those who refuse to produce it will be compelled to do so , or to give place to others . The history of other staple product corroborates these general statements . But if cotton has thus no absolute control over the consumption of the world , neither has it such enormous inherent value as to preeminently enrich its producers . Except the overgrown wealth of a few planters , and the nominal market value // of a host of slaves , there is absolutely nothing to indicate in the whole cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the ordinary forms of capital-houses , cities , railroads , canals , a large and rapidly increasing population , general abundance of money , comfort , and luxury-are miserably deficient there . The annual hay crop , a mere fragment of the production of the Korthern half of the Union , has hitherto exceeded in value the cotton which forms so large a portion of the annual production of the other half ! iBut if cotton be not essential to the comfort of the world , or if essential can be supplied abundantly from other quarters than our Southern States , and if its power in the production and accumulation of wealth is at best so moderate , whence arises the unquestioned homage it has hitherto received at th e South ? It proceeds , we apprehend , from two causes . First , the arrangements of the world , social , commercial , and industrial , are adjusted to it ; and though they could be easily modified to conform to its permanent displacement , yet so long as it continues to fill its present place , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon returning , it necessarily retains all its importance . Secondly , being now an article of universal use , it possesses like gold the prerogative of universal exchange throughout the civilized world . And it is easy to see that a bag of gold or an invoice of cotton , which can be exchanged at will for any species of foreign merchandise , may look much more valuable than a larger amount of wealth in the shape of bundles of hay , fit only to be consumed by vulgar cattle at home . Yet these vulgar products of hay and grain and cattle are in fact the real wealth of the nation , and the sinews of its power . They are the food of men ; and the labor and skill of men have developed the hidden forces of nature , till the whole land has become one vast magazine of accumulated wealth and power , compared with which bags of gold or bales of cotton are but as the rich man 's well-filled purse , and bank balances , compared with the amount of his bonds and mortgages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These considerations may enable us to expose some of the // preposterous fallacies of Southern political economists . If we understand Mr. Calhoun 's favorite theory aright , it was to this effect . All the imports of the country are paid for by the export of Southern cotton ; consequently the nation is indebted to Southern cotton for all the foreign articles of necessity , comfort , and luxury which it is enabled to purchase . But more than this : the expenses of the Federal government are defrayed , mainly , by taxes upon imports ; and as without cotton there could be no imports , it follows that the South , which produces cotton , thereby supplies nearly the whole revenue of the government , the greater portion of which goes to swell the wealth of Northern cities . But even this is not all . The effect of duties on imports is of course to enhance the price of similar articles produced at home , and these articles are produced exclusively at the North . It follows , of course , that the South , besides paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole revenue of the government , is in addition taxed indirectly to an enormous amount for the benefit of Northern manufacturers . The whole of this specious fabric of misrepresentation is based upon assertions demonstrably false and unfounded . It is true that of late years our imports have been chiefly paid for by cotton , because cotton was the most available merchandise for the purpose . If it had been wanting , other merchandise would have been exported in its place , or the amount of imports would have been curtailed . The balance of trade and exchanges will adjust itself , with or without cotton , to any conceivable circumstances . A civilized and industrious people will always be able to procure what it needs from abroad , or to provide substitutes at home . Indeed it may well be questioned whether we have not , as a nation , been greatly injured and demoralized by the enormous importations of every conceivable foreign luxury , which have been so facilitated , and almost necessitated by our exports of cotton and gold . The notion that cotton not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , is hardly worthy of a serious refutation . We might as well say that a turnpike gate pays the toll of the passenger . The taxes levied by the government upon // imports are paid by the earnings of the people . If there were no exports , and consequently no imports , the people would still have their earnings , and the government could appropriate the same portion of them by taxing domestic productions , or in any other way . The cotton sent abroad has been fairly exchanged for foreign merchandise , and the consumer of the latter has paid more for it than the value of the cotton , because the government chose this method of taxing him to obtain a revenue . But of this tax the original owner of the cotton obviously never paid a farthing , unless he chcise to consume a portion of the imported merchandise . It looks indeed more plausible to say that all duties on imported manufactures enhance the price of similar manufactures at home , and that in this way the Southern consumer is taxed for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Secessionists abroad , and has been greedily caught up and retailed by their foreign advocates , especially in England . But this is simply begging the question , and all such assertibns are contrary to notorious facts . In the first place , the enormous preponderance of consumption of foreign Inerchandise is in the Northern States , and this for a plain and simple reason . The classes of merchandise imported from abroad must necessarily be of superior quality and value , that the expenses of importation may miot form too large a proportion of their cost , and thus exclude them from the market . Precisely this description of merchandise is largely consumed at the North , where labor is honorable and well rewarded , and pecuniary competence is almost universal . At the South , on the contrary , while a few families indulge in great extravagance , the mass of the people , both white and black , are confined to the coarsest and commonest species of manufactures , such as can be produced in the North without protection , and in which Northern manufacturers can successfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain then , not only that the South has not built up Northern manufacturers , and has not furnished all the revenue of the government , but that it has in fact supplied but a small and very disproportionate part of it . // But this is not all . The revenue raised chiefly in the North , has been expended chiefly for the benefit of the South . While the post-offices and custom-houses of the North have been s*1fsustaining and a large source of national revenue , those of the South have been a heavy drain upon the national treasury . The public expenditure for the administration of justice and for national defence has been proportionately far greater at the South than at the North . The hnge tracts of territory , whose scanty inhabitants now lay claim to local independence , were first purchased by Northern wealth , then cultivated by Northern industry , defended by Northern arms , and enriched by Northern enterprise . And while the Southern States have contributed so little to the national treasury , the contents of that treasury have been far more liberally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the North . Indeed it may well be questioned , whether so sparse and poor a population as that of our Southern States could permanently sustain a government , except under conditions of despotic authority , which would render social progress impossible . In full accordance with these views we find that the imnmediate result of secession was to produce universal financial derangement at the South . Indeed the mere agitatiou of the subject and preparations for it produced a general panic . The South as usual was in debt ; but ready money was indispensable , and to obtain ready money it had but one resource-to sell its cotton . The North for obvious reasons was equally eager to buy , and consequently its ready money was swept off with such rapidity as to threaten a temporary bankruptcy . This appears to be the true explanation of the financial crisis of November and December , 1860 , for which there was no explanation in the general condition of comniercial affairs , and which passed away as rapidly as it had arisen , leaving few traces of injury , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cotton crop for ready money , the next financial resource of the South was the familiar and obvious one of repudiating its debts to the North , which , in the common course of trade , this same cotton would have paid . // As many honest Southern merchants would have refused to lend themselves to such a project , the matter was simplified by a decree of the " Confederate Congress , " enjoining upon all debtors , under heavy penalties , to pay into the Confederate treasury the amounts due their Northern creditors . Even before this , similar action had been taken by State authorities at the South . In the meantime heavy taxes were laid upon all classes of the people , and " voluntary contributions " were extorted from the rich . In these various ways large amounts of money were obtained for the service of the rebellion . By this time , however , war was fairly inaugurated , and Southern industry , never very productive , had become more restricted than ever . It could no longer produce either money , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be had . The usual resort of despotic governments soon followed -- an irredeemable paper currency , or what is the same thing , a currency redeemable six months after the acknowledgment of Southern independence . A government with ample resources , like that of England or the United States , may with perfect propriety , when engaged in a desperate struggle for national existence , put forth its paper promises , conscious of its ability to redeem them in due time to the uttermost farthing . But with what semblance of decency can any body of men profess to promise payment on behalf of a community already hopelessly insolvent , whose crops are pledged*before they come to market , whose so-called capital is the flesh and blood of its laboring population , and whose very land is worthless till released from the control of its present owners ? The result is a matter of course . Practically the people of the Southern States have been plundered of everything , to support for a brief season the mockery of a government which has ruined them . Small as their wealth has been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oriental countries , a tenth , a fifth , or a third , but everything has been swept away by the relentless agents of tyranny . Whatever could feed or clothe the army has been appropriated for that purpose ; whatever could , by possibility , fall into the hands of the enemy , has been recklessly // destroyed . Whatever mechanical skill existed has been applied to military purposes , and he that could do nothing else was made to fight , nolens volens , in the " Confederate " ranks . In this manner the whole resources of the people were seized , and appropriated to the purposes of a small knot of conspirators ; and the only equivalent offered consisted in the worthless promises of a bankrupt Treasury ! A more audacious system of wholesale spoliation and plunder was never recorded in history . The slow progress and comparative failure of the measures first adopted by the Federal government to crush the rebellion have necessarily resulted in adding greatly to the strength of the Southern despotism ; for no community can remain long without a government , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the resources of legitimate authority gradually fell into the hands of the usurper , though pitiably curtailed . Customs duties , direct taxes , voluntary loans , all have been tried with the most meagre results ; and the desperate necessities of the Confederate government have left it no alternative , even at the outset of its swindling career , but to confiscate the property of its victims with the one hand , while extending to them its paper promises with the other . Of course this can not last forever . A promise to pay is valueless unless it is kept , and with every fresh issue of such promises , payment beccmes more impossible . The mere delay of payment by solvent communities will depreciate their currency , if more notes are issued than are absolutely required for business purposes . This was evident in the history of the Bank of England about the beginning of the present century , and is equ ally evident at the present time in the currency of the United States . How much worse must the result be in the case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulation to an amount far exceeding the wants of the community . Even if the rebellion were successful , it would probably never be redeemed at par ; if unsuccessful , of course it can not be redeemed at all . The triumph of the rebellion would therefore involve a permanent depression of all classes of Southern society , except // the great slaveholding aristocracy and their immediate dependants , including those enriched in various ways at the expense of the public . Land and slaves would obviously be more valuable than ever , while the redundant paper currency , if not absolutely repudiated , would be of little use to its unfortunate possessors for the purchase of the necessaries of life . The enormous and consolidated wealth of the few would doubtless be employed to establish a hereditary and permanent oligarchy , which would monopolize the government of the country . The middle class of merchants and traders would be greatly diminished and impoverished by the loss of capital and business ; the small planters would be more than ever overshadowed by their wealthy neighbors , and labor would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the rebellion is subdued , it is true that great loss and suffering can not be avoided , but they may be mitigated and ultimatcly repaired . The property plundered from the people and sacrificed in a war of selfish ambition , can never be restored ; and the worthless paper , for which it was exchanged , will soon disappear from view . But the resources of the country will remain undiminished , and once released from the incubus of a controlling oligarchy on the one hand , and the demoralizing effect of slave labor on the other , they will be developed with a rapidity and power , which will astonish no one so much as the Southern people themselves . One of the favorite fallacies of Southern partisans has always been that the North owes all its wealth and power to the good-natured liberality of the South . " Our cotton , " they say , " has enriched the Northern factors , agents , merchants , and bankers ; has freighted INorthern ships , , has supplied Northern spindles , and swelled the colossal fortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retail , without number . " This style of reasoning is not unnatural nor altogether new . It is the language of the man , who , having come into the world not to minister unto others , but to be ministered unto , and having by fortune , or violence , or fraud , the means of commanding the services of others , imagines that he confers a great favor upon them by allowing them to work for him ! // The aristocratic European fancies the whole parish dependent on him for subsistence , while in reality no individual in the community could be more easily or cheerfully spared . Abroad , he accuses the whole world of living upon him , without stopping to consider that he pays for nothing which he does not receive . In the same spirit the wealthy Southerner despises the Northern adventurer , who comes to do for him what he can not or will not do for himself , and grudges the Northern merchant or manufacturer the fair recompense of his capital , labor , and skill . His fields , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce cotton , but he can not eat cotton , drink cotton , nor even wear cotton , till Northern skill has made it into cloth , lie can not compress it into bales till Northern hemp has furnished bagging and rope . Being generally in debt , he can not get along without advances of Northern capital , even before his crop is brought to market . He can not manufacture it at home , and he has no ships to send it abroad ; he must , therefore , transfer it to the Northern merchant and manufacturer before it can have a market value . NOW as his cotton without these operations is worthless , it is not only just that those who perform them should be remunerated , but it is evident that they confer wealth on him , at least as much as he does on them . If there is any favor in the case , it is bestowed by those who do for him what he can not do for himself . The whole frame-work of society is made up of mutual services , mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine that it is more honorable to pay for a service rendered than to render a service for pay . " The laborer is worthy of his hire . " If the South continues poor while the North has been rapidly growing rich , it is not because the latter has not paid in money , in food , in clothing , or otherwise , the full equivalent of all the Southern cotton it has bought , nor that Northern ships have been paid more than other ships for carrying it , nor that Northern merchants and bankers have been able to charge higher commissions than others . There has been no monopoly of this kind forced upon the South : // The whole secret of Northern wealth and Southern poverty lies in one little word-labor . Where labor is honored and diligently pursned , there must be wealth and prosperity ; where it is despised and disregarded , poverty will be the rule and wealth the exception . These views are fully illustrated by the financial history of the North , during the present war . At the first outbreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alarm . The first impulse of Northern merchants was to lay in heavy stocks of cotton ; the first impulse ot too many Sonthern merchants was to refuse payment of their debts due at the North . The cotton crop was hurried forward with unusual rapidity , and sold promptly for cash at unusually high prices , while large amounts due from the South remained unpaid . The natural effect of all this was to create for the moment a heavy balance of payments against the North , leading to great scarcity of money , distrust , curtailment of credit , and almost a monetary crisis . With admirable sagacity and good judgment , the New York banks , appreciating the temporary nature of the emergency , threw themselves into the breach , and by judicious and liberal loans averted the impending danger . In a few weeks the difficulty was at an end , and money as abundant as ever . Those merchants who depended for their solvency on Southern remittances , were in many cases ruined by the practical repudiation of their debtors ; but the community stood firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably made up by the increased value of cotton and other Southern produce which had passed into the hands of Northern merchants . The utter fallacy of Southern predictions wa s now demonstrated . Banks and bankers , merchants and capitalists , consumers and producers remained , with few exceptions , in much the same position as before . Capital and labor , it is true , became somewhat deranged by non-intercourse with time Sonth , but as the change was necessarily gradual , they learned by degrees to find new chaniimels for their activity . The country continued to produce an ample supply of food and other necessaries for its population ; and whether a portion of that population were engaged in uministering to the wants of // the South or in fighting against it , the country was able to feed and clothe them as before . Simple and natural as this result may appear to us , it was doubtless unintelligible and unexpected to Southerners generally . A local aristocracy , monopolizing the land and wealth of its own community , can not easily be made to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of intelligent and organized labor , in a population free from the incubus of caste and privilege . At the South , the mass of the people have little to spare beyond a bare subsistence , and all extraordinary burdens must be borne by the few wealthy . At the North , the wealth of the few is as nothing to the enormous aggregate of moderate accumulations made by the in ass of the laboring population . It is true that vast numbers of this population are employed in transporting , manufacturing , and distributing the cotton , from which so large a part of the clothing of the people is made . But it is equally true that the people will be clothed , whether they have cotton or not . Whatever its material , wool , hemp , flax , or jute , it will be provided , and those who provide it will live by it , as they formerly did by cotton . Had this been all , our troubles would have been light indeed . But in addition to this temporary derangement of capital and industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a colossal scale . An enormous navy had to be extemporized for the blockade of many hundred miles of coast , as well as for aggressive expeditions . Six or seven hundred thousand men , not poor peasantry accustomed to privation , but well-to-do citizens demanding high pay , good clothing and comfortable care , had to be sent into the field , and equipped on the most lavish scale , with all the appliances of modern warfare . All this required an imiumense expenditure , and the funds must be furnished by taxation upon a people , few of whom had ever known what federal taxation was , or by loans negotiated in a community , nearly every mami of which was habitually in debt ! During the early stages of the rebellion it was confidently expected , we presume , by most at the North , where the loyal spirit of the country was so signally developed , that the cordial // sympathy of the mother country would be bestowed upon our righteous cause . It was scarcely possible to conceive otherwise . " Governments derive their just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here was a government , lawfully chosen by a majority of the governed , defied and insulted by the very men whom the majority had repudiated , and who had solemnly sworn obedience to the law . The revolution of 1776 was an uprising of the people against a tyrannical government ; the rebellion of 1861 was a conspiracy of a tyrannical ruling class against the liberties of the people . The revolution of 1776 was a vindication of liberty and equality for all classes ; the rebellion of 1861 was the assertion of the privilege of caste and of the perpetuity of human bondage . The revolution of 1776 was directed and completed by the wisest and best men of the nation ; the rebellion of1861 was devised and carried out by the most profligate politicians of the country . The former called forth a spirit and developed characters which form the brightest ornament of human history ; the latter has elicited displays of fraud , falsehood , and violence , worthy of savages or demons . But all this availed nothing to turn the current of English sympathy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English interests , real or supposed . For many years British ship-owners had cast longing eyes upon the vast coasting trade of the Western continent , from which their vessels were excluded ; and British free-traders had chafed at the still remaining barriers , by which American manufacturers were protected . The ruling classes of Great Pritain might also naturally fear the ultimate influence of a vast and successful democratic power in the politics of Europe . The division of the United States into two great rival and hostile confederacies would seem to favor all these ungenerous aspirations . The South being notoriously destitute of ships and sailors , its cominerce would naturally fall into the hands of its largest customer , Great Britain . Having no manufactures of its own , it would naturafly seek to exchange its raw produce for foreign manufactures , with the most perfect freedom of trade . And , finally , its native rivalry and long cherished hatred of time // North , would lead to an antagonism which would effectually preclude all future danger to Europe from either party . Plausible as all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never more completely outwitted itself . For nations , as for individuals , " honesty is the best policy . " These blind advocates of Southern independence forgot , that while they sought to secure a monopoly of trade with communities too poor and uncivilized to be profitable customers , they must of necessity alienate and build up in commercial independence other communities of double their population and many times their producing and consuming power . And though for a time the two rival powers they sought to establish might prey upon each other , and let Europe alone , the time would doubtless come , when , having composed their feuds , and each having developed its military and naval power to the utmost , they would unite to give law to Europe and to the world . In the meantime , however , having become imbued with these views , the wealthy classes of Great Britain naturally refrained from lending money to prevent a result , which they regarded as desirable for English interests , and did their utmost to discredit the United States government in the money markets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no English money would ever be loaned to carry on this " unholy war , " and even went into elaborate calculations to demonstrate the utter inability of the loyal States to prosecute the contest they had so rashly and so wickedly undertaken ! What was the Secretary of the Treasury to do ? At the very outset of his career he had committed , as we think , a very serious , though not unnatural mistake , by refusing a large part of the proposals for which he himself had advertised , in the first loan negotiated after his accession to office . It is doubtless unpleasant to accept 92 per cent , for bonds which had recently commanded 120 ; but credit , like water , will find its level , and no effort or contrivance will long avail to prevent it . On the other hand , to refuse offers made in good faith , and when no higher offers could be obtained , could not fail to check the disposition of capitalists to make any offers at all . It was rumored // that a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . for six per cent . bonds , and it was argued that it would have been wise to accept this offer for the sake of enlisting Rothschild and the Times in our behalf . However that may be , ft was SkUely YQ*5 4eswab1*e *o enlist the wealth of our own people irrevocably in the great work of ' sustaining the government against rebellion . The favorite idea , however , and the main reliance of the Secretary at this time , appears to have been a great popular loan , similar to those so successfully made in France during the Crimean war . Ife did not , perhaps , sufficiently consider , that while in France the people are given to saving , our own people are given to spending all and more than all their income , so that the available surplus wealth of the comumnity is found chiefly in the hands of wealthy individuals and corporations . Accordingly the Secretary , having lost his chance with the capitalists , addressed a powerful and patriotic appeal to the banks of the three great commercial cities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is umnderstood , the general outline of that masterly plan of military operations , which , if not interfered with in execution , would doubtless have justified his expectations . The banks , as is well known , responded promptly to the proposal , and assumed $150,000,000 of the government loan , which the Secretary doubtless hoped to see speedily absorbed through them by the people . A new element of disturbance here began to manifest itself . Up to this time all loans and payments to and by the government had been made in specie . The financial position of the country had been unusually favorable . A very large crop of cotton had been exported , and much of it sold at enormous profits . An unusual demand for grain and flour in Europe had been met by copious supplies from this country , and thus large balances were created in our favor abroad , while our imports , owing to the uncertainty and apprehension which pervaded the community , were reduced to a very low point . Large quantities of gold flowed into the country , and money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Congress to replenish the Treasury , was an issue of // $50,000,000 demand notes , redeemable in gold , and receivable at the treasury on a par with gold . No sooner was the volume of currency thus augmented than the inevitable laws of currency began to operate , and specie began to disappear from the bank vaults in which it had been long accumulating . The result was inevitable ; the New York banks suspended specie payments , and all other banks throughout the country followed their example . At this stage of affairs an attempt was made by a committee of bankers and merchants from the principal commercial cities to suggest arrangements by which the wants of the government might be met , without preventing an early resumption of specie payments . The scheme matured by them , after much delibeThtion and discussion , and proposed to the government , was as follows : that no more demand notes should be issued than the $50,000,000 already authorized by Congress ; that the immediate and pressing demands of government creditors should be met by the issue of $100,000,000 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , and tiat further supplies when needed should be obtained by the sale of government bonds to the highest bidders . To prevent a needless drain of deposits , it was also recommended that the funds of the government should be temporarily entrusted to such banks as the Secretary of the Treasury might select , and payments made by checks upon those banks , without the intervention of the sub-treasury . In order to fortify the public credit , it was also earnestly recommended that Congress should immediately pass a joint resolution , declaring the intention of both houses to establish an efficient system of taxation . Of all these proposed measures the last only was adopted . Had they all been carried out , there is no reason to doubt that they would have been successful , at least for a time , in supplying the wants of the government and enabling the banks to resume specie payments without serious risk of insolvency . Whether they would have given permanent relief is a problem which can not now be decided . It appears to have been the belief of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to his statistics the annual savings of the country being // only $300,000,000 , while its public expenditure was nearly twice as much , temporary insolvency in some form was inevitable . It does not seem to have occurred to lilin , that if the lavish expenditure of our population had left a surplus of $300,001,000 in prosperous times , it was fair to presume that a close and compulsory economy might easily augment that surplus to $1,000,000,000 . It is certain that for many months after the war began , the country paid its expenses and debts , domestic and foreign , with perfect ease and promptness . But as time passed on , the enormous and increasing waste of public money , the gigantic developments of the contest , and the returning spirit of extravagance in the people , as well as the systematic and persistent attacks of the English press upon our government and public credit , have turned the balance so heavily against us that probably no amount of financial skill could have maintained affairs on a specie basis , without producing great distress throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government was perhaps the least of necessary evils . The country still possessed in the credit of its banks a currency nearly equivalent to specie . But as the government could not borrow specie , even at a discount , it naturally preferred to issue its own currency , which it could not but regard as fully equal in value to that of the banks . To secure its universal reception , this currency was ( very properly , as we think ) made a legal tender . But as the bank currency of the loyal states had never much exceeded $150,000,000 , and as a redundant paper currency invariably produces speculation and inflation of prices , the government should have checked the issue of bank notes by taxation , to leave room for the safe circulation of its own paper . As this was not done , the very abundance of treasury notes stimulated the issue of bank notes and credits , for the latter could always be redeemed by means of the former . Paper money thus becoming excessively abundant , its owners had no alternative but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other speculators . Prices of merchandise and especially of stocks began to rise , and as foreign muerchandise could only be purchased with gold or its equivalent , the value // of gold and the rates of foreign exchange kept continually advancing . In short , all the phenomena of a depreciated currency have been plainly manifested . It would be a great mistake , howe*er , to assume with the London Thnes , and with certain " bullionists " at home , that the finances of the country are hopelessly embarrassed , or ( the most ridiculous supposition of all ) that the whole vast mass of pecuniary transactions throughout the country has been modified 20 or 30 per cent. , because gold has commanded 20 or 30 per cent . premium . The truth appears to be , that while there has been some depreciation of currency , there has been a much larger advance in the value of gold , caused principally by the demand for exportation , but aggravated by speculation and needless panic . In illustration of this , let us suppose that our money consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should occur in Europe . Of course the whole or nearly all of our " legal tender " merchandise would be sent abroad to feed the starving , and our banks and government would be compelled to postpone cash payments until after the next harvest . In like manner the ignorance of the English public , arid the malignant calumnies of most of the Engli sIr journals , have created a distrust , amounting to panic , of American securities , which have therefore been sent to this conntry in large amounts , with peremptory orders to sell them and remit the proceeds in gold or its equivalent . That a new and fresh country , like our own , with an unlimited demand for capital to make its vast natural resources available , but with its industry suddenly checked , its credit impaired , and its values depreciated by war , with a repudiated or suspended Southern debt of *200,000,000 , should be able promptly to meet these extraordinary foreign demands , was out of the question . The first effect of this state of things was to increase the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other merchandise which could be employed to pay our debts abroad . This effect was greatly aggravated by the redundancy of paper money . When the amount of currency in circulation is double the quantity required by the public , the holders of it will necessarily have some difficulty in getting rid of it , and at length // this can only be effected by paying higher prices for what they buy . The difficulty , however , is only transferred , not remedied ; and the seller becomes in turn a buyer of something eVse at an advanced price . So the vici6us circle of speculation continues , until an equilibrium is established between the amount of currency and the values it measures . In the meantime , another element of disturbance , and a very dangerous one , may have been introduced . If everybody were certain that the Government currency would be redeerued at par in gold within a reasonable time , it is difficult to suppose that a premium of nearly 40 per cent . would voluntarily be paid for gold . Undoubtedly the disposition to speculate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been greatly enhanced by a tacitly recognized apprehension that the United States Government will ultior b to pay its debts in full . mately prove unable unwillin* This scandalous imputation was made long since by certain English journals , and is probably concurred in by many foreign merchants here , as well as by certain disloyal or desponding Americans . Just as it was predicted that " the North would not fight , " that " the West would join the South , " and that " Congress would not levy taxes , and the people would not pay them , " so now it is asserted that the country will repudiate its obligations ! Yet , preposterous as it may seem , this supposition indicates a real danger . It would have been absurd to have saddled the nation with the redemption of Continental money , at a value many hundred times above that for which it was originally received . So at the South , few would probably be found sunple enough to expect the arch-repudiator to make good his " Confederate scrip " for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if our able but somewhat eccentric minister of finance should persist in his course of increasing . the volume of paper currency instead of diminishing it , its depreciation will become so great as to furnish a plausible argument for repudiation . It is said that a few months since , large contracts for government clothing were cancelled by the Quartermaster-General on the supposition that a suf // ficient supply had been secured , but that subsequent events made it necessary to renew these contracts at an advance of 50 per cent . in prices ! How easy for some demagogue , courting popularity , to argue that to pay such obligations in specie , would be to plunder the public for the benefit of a contractor , and that the Government , when it is prepared to pay specie , ought to have the benefit of the current premium upon it , like any private citizen . In this way the dishonesty and scandal of a refusal to redeem in full the solemnly contracted obligations of the state may be so disguised and covered up , as to puzzle even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and obvious . The paper currency of the United State8 *nu8t not be allowed to depreciate . Not that gold can or ought to be kept at par . The exigencies of the country are too great , and the power of foreign ignorance and malevolence too real , to make that possible or desirable . But by a judicious curtailment of paper issues-by a tax on bank circulation  --  and by selling government bonds at the market price at every possible opportunity , thus making money comparatively scarce and good investments abundant , the spirit of speculation would be speedily checked , the prices of merchandise would fall , and the people , no longer stimulated and led astray by a fictitious prosperity , would quickly resume the wholesome habits of economy which they had learned a year ago , but from which they are beginning to depart . It is easy to see that when the currency of the country is undergoing depreciation , the heaviest loss must fall upon the mass of working people . Capitalists scent the danger afar off , and exchange their money for land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth . Merchants and traders , farmers and manufacturers , are able to advance the prices of their commodities , as fast as the medium of payment loses its value , while they pay their debts with greater facility than ever . But the laboring man has no such resource . ITe can not postpone his work from day to day , to enable him to arrange combinations with thousands of fellow-workmen for an advancing scale of wages , nor will his employers admit his // claim till necessity compels them , and his necessity is apt to be greater than theirs . If his little earnings are in the savings bank , he has neither the knowledge nor the skill necessary to invest them in merchandise , nor the facilities indispensable for dcing it to advantage , lie is , therefore , the first and worst victim of financial repndiation , and a permanently depreciated currency is therefore preeminently a crime aaaiwst the people ! It is almost too obvious to need remark , that such a depreciation tends to aggravate and perpetuate itself . As it operates continually to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it naturally fosters extravagance in the former , while it impoverishes the rest of the people ; thus doubly diminishing the surplus earnings of the community . By enhancing the cost of all merchandise , it compels the Government to pay dearer for its supplies , while it renders taxation less and less productive . Capitalists of course will not lend to a Government to be repaid at a discount hereafter , and therefore currency must continue to be issued and tn depreciate , until it is repudiated altogether . Thus it happened with the American Continental currency , and the necessity of the case excused it . Thus it will probably happen with the Southern Confederate currency , and such a result would be in perfect harmony with every part of that gigantic swindle . But before such a consummation could be tolerated by the Government and people of the United States , surely the tongue of every honest citizen must cleave to the roof of his mouth , and his right hand forget its cunnino* It has been a great misfortune of the loyal states in the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their prosperity . A heavy tax bill at the outset , with the continuance of specie payments by banks and government , would have been the best possible financial position for the country . The nearer we can now approach to - it by bringing our paper money as near as possible to a specie standard , ( which can only be done by withdrawing a large portion of it from circulation , ) the greater will be the economy practised by both government and people , and the more they will get for their money . // Our recent experience in currency may enable us to judge what effect the introduction of " free bankino ' " based on United States stocks , would have on the finances of the community . If the issues of a central treasury , moderate at first , and always exchangeable at par for United States bonds , have had the effect at once to stop specie payments and in a few months to drive gold to a premium of 30 or 40 per cent. , what would , what could be the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushrooms over the country with the power of investing their whole capital in United States bonds , and exchanging those bonds for notes to be used as money ! Should these notes fail to be redeemed on presentation , the bonds must again be sold to redeem them , and thus it would be in the power of any petty gang of swindlers to affect unfavorably the public funds . This , however , would be as nothing , compared with the wide-spread destruction which would result from the collapse of such a currency , expanded during a period of speculation to twice its proper dimensions , culrninating in a disastrous revulsion , as munch worse than any i n our past history , as the system that led to it would be more unwieldy and more fatal . Yet such issubstantially the favorite financial scheme of the Secretary of the Treasury . An engine of far more political power than was the United States Bank in its proudest days , and far more dangerous financially , because entirely wanting in the centralization which is indispensable to a sound convertible currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guard it by insisting upon a permanent reserve of specie , and by demanding periodical statements of asset* and liabilities . But when these statements are numbered by hundreds and thousands , even supposing they are honestly rendered , who will be able to read them ? And as to the specie , that may all belong to depositors and still conform to the requisitions of the law . Even if there were no depositors , and the specie were a bonafide reserve , it might be swept away in the first commercial crisis , and still leave the bank hopelessly insolvent . There is indeed one , and only one , argument to be used in // favor of this scheme , which by the time these lines meet the reader 's eye , will probably be a subject of earnest debate in Congress . While it is the unquestionable right of the general government to furnish the paper currency of the country , that right has been so long waived that the issues of lqcal banks have superseded it , and have acquired a prescriptive claim on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It seemsprobable that the Secretary , despairing of success in putting them down altogether , preferred to attempt the more feasible compromise of inducing Jocal banks to issue a quasi national currency , guaranteed by deposits of national stocks , and therefore safe as regards ultimate redemption . But this forms no guarantee against the danger of overissues referred to above , producing periodical collapses in the currency and extensive financial ruin to the community . Whether these can be prevented at all under a " free banking " system , which opens the door to practically unlimited issues of paper money , seems doubtful  --  but possibly a provision that no bank should in any case invest more than one half of its capital in this way , and a prohibition of loans by such banks on mortgage or any securities , except commercial paper of moderate length , and above all a general release from all usury laws , at least up to some such limit as 9 or 12 per cent. , might enable the experiment to succeed , until a real national currency could be substituted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patience of oni readers for the present . In bringing these somewhat desultory remarks to a close , we have no better moral to offer than what political economy has long since established : That labor is the only true source of wealth ; that the best credit may be abused ; that a redundant currency must depreciate ; and that for nations as for individuals , " honesty is the best policy . " Since the above was in type , the report of the Secretary of the Treasury has been presented to Congress . Its conservative tone is as gratifying as it is unexpected ; and we devoutly hope that he will allow no external pressure to interfere with his // resolution to cheek the issues of currency and to dispose of United States bonds at their market value . We can not see that he could not have done this without further legislation , for the bids of lenders aie the best evidence of market valuebnt we concur with him in his proposed modifications of the law . We would also strongly recommend leaving the ter ? n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The provision for optional redemption after five years , is " di8counted , " as the French say , by capitalists , who take it for granted that the bonds will be redeemed at the end of five years , and therefore bid much lower rates than they would for a positive ten years loan . By all means let the Government have all the money it can command on the shortest time , but should the conditions prove too unfavorable , let the longer term be resorted to . At any rate let the term , short or long , be fixed when the loan is made . The Secretary 's arguments to show that the currency has not depreciated , we must , with due deference , pronounce to be unsatisfactory . Of course the more notes are issued , the more will be required , when every fresh issue is accompanied by a rise in prices . Admitting the depreciation at present to be temporary in its character , how long will it take to make it permanent ? The call for fresh notes means that the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the land to enhance prices , and to build np and sustain fictitious values , want more for the same purpose . Meantime this nominal wealth is being squandered with frightful rapidity , while the Government needs every dollar the people can save to lend it . Precisely the same phenomenon occurred during the suspension of the Bank of Ei*gland , and its directors argued as Mr. Chase does now , that the people needed the currency for their legitimate business . But when specie payments were resumed , though gradually and after long notice , half th*om mercial world was ruined . Yet what would the notes have been worth without such resumption ? Let us be warned in time . It is no reply to this to show that certain great staples have depreciated as well as the currency . No wonder if wheat , // pork , and even corn , kept back from their natural market , fall in value . But let peace return and the starving South be reopened to trade , and these commodities will soon follow the example of flour , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a few months about as much as gold . Mr. Chase refers to the monetary derangement caused by the loan of some thirteen million dollars , made by him in November last , but omits to state that the amount was borrowed first in advance ; then ten per cent . of the bids ( making above $3,600,000 ) was paid in , and finally the loan itself was paid up . Had lie asked for fifty millions , payable in installments of ten per cent . at intervals of ten days , the derangement would have been far less , and the aid to the Government far greater . We may also assure him that if the New York money market was disturbed , and legal tender notes were scarce , it was because the huge flood of speculation had swept them to places where they never should have gone  --  and no theory will ever remedy this state of things , " which grows by what it feeds on , " but a reduction of inflated values to a legitimate basis . We may further assure him that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agonies of liquidation , money was abundant for commercial purposes , and that the financial atmosphere elsewhere was as calm as a summer morning ! We long for . a national currency as munch as Mr. Chase does , and we would rather have his quasi national currency than none at all-provided Congress will so modify the scheme as to protect the commercial public against the ruinous effects of over issues . It is idle to assert that the possession of even the best securities can ensure convertibility into coin . These do not create money-they only draw it from other quarters where in times of crisis it may be even more needed . It is equally idle to suppose that banks will , of their own accord , keep down their issues because they have to deposit security . Such banks as would do this would be safe without any security  --  but the ignorant and reckless will be tempted by the hope of double interest to expand their issues to the utmost , and at the first collapse they will be ruined , and nei // ther the note-holders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less severe . But if for every dollar thus invested in currency , a bank must have another dollar of specie , the loan of which shall be limited strictly to short mercantile paper , the currency will increase only as fast as money capital increases , and the one will protect the other . Without this , or some equivalent safeguard , the experiment , we fear , will sooner or later prove a disastrous one . Again we thank the Secretary for his conservative and able report , and most heartily wish him success in the difficult task he has undertaken .
