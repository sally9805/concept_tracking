txt //ion . For a long time , no doubt , error sprang from that country ; but years and events have passed since that state of things existed . The liberal and tolerant spirit , enlightened by philosophy , which has spread all over liberal England , has also been reflected in the opinions formed of men , and has modified many pages of biography and history and made Englishmen feel how numerous were the wrongs of which they were guilty toward their illustrious countryman . It is useless to speak of the national selfishness of England , and pretend that she only appreciates or rewards with her love and esteem such writers as flatter her pride or hide her defects from the eyes of foreigners . This may be true , generally speaking ; but Lord Byron 's patriotic feelings were of a very different cast . He thought it best to expose to the world at large the faults of his countrymen , in order to correct them . His patriotism was influenced by the superiority of the noble sentiments which actuated his life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , a member of the great human community , and declaring it openly ; despising popularity , if it cost him the sacrifice of a truth which he deemed it useful and right to proclaim , and thus going against many of the passions , prejudices , and opinions of his countrymen , Byron certainly wounded many susceptibilities ; and could we forget all he had to suffer at the hands of the English , we might almost say he was too severe in his judgments upon them . Notwithstanding , however , it is almost impossible to travel in England without meeting everywhere some token of homage paid to the memory of Byron . Scotland , who looks upon him almost as a son , is proud to show the several houses wherein he lived when a child , and preserves his name and memory with love and respect . To have seen him once , is a recollection of which one is proud . A particular charm encircles the places , mountains , rivers , and bridge of Don , of which he speaks , simply because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any thing which has belonged to him is looked upon as a treasure . At Harrow , the beloved residence of his youth , the growing generation bow with affectionate respect before the pyramid which has been erected to his memory by the love of a former youthful generation . At Cambridge , among all the monuments which recall the glories of the past , Lord Byron 's statue commands the rest , and occupies the place of honor . The rooms which he had there are shown and reverenced as places which have harbored genius . In Parliament the same man who formerly , by unjust and unmerited criticisms of the youthful poet , decried his growing genius , and who was guilty of other wrongs against him , has made an act of reparation and of justice by expressing publicly his regret that a grudge of the dean in Byron 's time had prevailed to prevent a monument being erected in Westminster Abbey to the memory of the poet . The pilgrimage to Newstead is looked upon as an intellectual feast , if not as a duty , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them that they do not admit that he is equalled by any contemporary poet or likely to be surpassed by those who follow . No doubt , therefore , England now-a-days only prefers what formerly she used to exact from her poets . Moore 's culpable timidities and Macaulay 's declamatory exaggerations must , at least , be looked upon as weaknesses of character , which would have been disowned by themselves , had they lived long enough to witness the change in public opinion . Although full justice has not yet been done to the noble character of the man , still partial justice has been rendered to Byron 's memory by the summary dismissal of the numerous false writings which appeared and which tended to replace the truth by the creations of fancy , and to put into the mouth of the poet the thoughts of their authors and not his own , or to insult him by a magnanimous defense , the honor and glory of which was to redound entirely to the writers . It is necessary to observe , that if Byron was openly calumniated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his death by disguised slander , especially by that kind of absolution which in reality is one of the most odious forms of calumny , since it is the most hypocritical and most difficult to deal with , and least likely to be touched . But England has at last understood the truth and settled all such opinions . To England , therefore , these pages , which contain the rectification of certain old opinions , will be useless . But can the same be said of other countries , and of France especially ? Even now-a-days , we read such fanciful appreciation of Byron 's character that we could almost believe that the rumors and calumnies which came from England had never been refuted ; and that extraordinary views expressed by Lamartine in beautiful verse are still entertained , and the question still asked , whether Byron was " a devil or an angel ? " On reading such appreciations , it seems opportune to present those who admire genius and truth with a very humble but conscientious study of Byron 's great mind . Can it be objected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the interest of the reader ? Can a genius be a stranger to man , and does not the earth seem too small to contain such exceptional beings ? Our civilization , which has almost suppressed every physical barrier that exists between the nations of the earth , has still further annihilated those of the intellect : so much so , that Shakspeare , Dante , Goethe , are as much revered in France as in their respective countries , notwithstanding the difference of the idioms in which they have written . The same will occur in respect to Lord Byron , whose name alone opposes every barrier , and against whom the difference of nationality can not form any obstacle . The language of genius is not of one country only , but appertains to humanity in general : and God Himself has implanted its rules in every heart . This book is not a regular nor a methodical biography . Nor is it an apology ; but rather a study , an analysis , the portrait of a great mind seen under all its aspects , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the truth , and to rest upon indisputable facts and rely upon unimpeachable testimony . The public now , it is said , can not bear eulogy , and cares only to know the weak points of great men . We do not believe this to be the case . It would be too severe a criticism of human nature in general , and of our times in particular . In any case , we can not accept the statement as correct , when applied to noble characters to whom we especially dedicate this work . It may be , the reader will find in our essay beauties which he had not yet observed , which have hitherto been disputed in the original , and which less sympathetic natures than ours might term complacent eulogies ; but the fear of being blamed and of being unpopular shall not deter us from our intention of bringing them forth . No criticism can prevent our praising , when he deserves it , the man who never knew the weaknesses of jealousy , and who never failed to bestow eulogy upon every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In publishing the book we are , moreover , certain that what to-day may appear praise , to-morrow will be termed justice . Lord Byron shone at a period when a school called Romantic was in progress of formation . That school wanted a type by which to mould its heroes , as a planet requires a sun to give it light . It took Byron as that type , and adorned him with all the qualities which pleased its fancy , but the time has more than arrived when it is necessary that truth should reveal him in his true light . My book is not likely to dispel every cloud , but a few shades only add to the lustre and brilliancy of a landscape . LORD BYRON . " Others form the man : I tell of him . "  --  MONTAIGNE . At all times the world has been very unjust ; and ( who does not know it ? ) in the history of nations many an Aristides has paid with exile the price of his virtues and his popularity . Great men , great countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear up against injustice ; and the truth is , that vice has so often taken the place of virtue , evil of good , and error of truth , some have been judged so severely and others so leniently , that , could the book of redress be written , not only would it be too voluminous , but it would also be too painful to peruse . Honest people would feel shame to see the judgments before which many a great mind has had to bend ; and how often party spirit , either religious or political , moved by the basest passions  --  such as hatred , envy , rivalry , vengeance , fanaticism , intolerance , self-love  --  has been a pretext for disfiguring in the eyes of the public the greatest and noblest characters . It would then be seen how some censor ( profiting by the breach which circumstances , or even a slight fault on the part of these great minds , may have made , and joining issue with other inferior judges of character ) has often succeeded in throwing a shade on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation , like those little insects which from their number actually succeed , notwithstanding their smallness , in darkening the rays of the sun . What is worse , however , is , that when history has once been erroneously written , and a hero has been put forward in colors which are not real , the public actually becomes accessory to the deception practiced upon it : for it becomes so enamored of the false type which has been held out to its admiration that it will not loosen its hold on it . Public opinion , once fixed , becomes a perfect despotism . Never , perhaps , has this phenomenon shown itself more visibly and more remarkably than in the case of Lord Byron . Not only was he a victim of these obstinate prejudices , but in his case the annihilation of truth and the creation of an imaginary type have been possible only at the cost of common sense , and notwithstanding the most palpable contradictions . So that he has really proved to be one of the most curious instances of the levity with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various phases of this phenomenon , one of the principal causes of which has been the resolution to identify the poet with the first heroes of his poems . Such a mode of proceeding was as disloyal as it was contrary to all the received rules of literature . It was inspired by hatred and vengeance , adopted by an idle and frivolous public , and the result has proved to be something entirely opposed to the truth . As long as such a whimsical creation was harmless , it amused Byron himself and his friends ; but the day came when it ceased to be harmless without ceasing to be eccentric , and became to Byron a true robe of Nessus . At his death the truth was demanded of his biographers ; but the puppet which had been erected stood there , and amazed the good , while it served the malice of the wicked . His genius was analyzed , but no conscientious study of his character was made , and Byron , as man , remained an unknown personage . Yet among his biographers there were men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek to raise themselves at the cost of depreciating him , nor to gain popularity by sparing individuals at the expense of Lord Byron . If among them many proved to be black sheep , there were several , on the other hand , who were sincere , and even kindly disposed . Yet not one did full justice to Byron , not one defended him as he deserved , not one explained his true character with the conscientious energy which in itself constitutes authority . We shall speak elsewhere of the causes which gave rise to this phenomenon . We shall mention the part which public opinion played in England when suddenly displeased with a poet who dared sound the deepest recesses of the human heart ; and who as an artist and a psychologist was interested in watching the growth of every passion , and especially that of love , regardless of the conjugal felicity which that public wished him to respect . It began to fear that its enthusiasm for Lord Byron was a national crime , and by degrees became accessory to the calumnies which were heaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want of patriotism , and his refusal to be blind to the defects of the mother-country . We shall see how his biographers , preferring invention to strict adherence to the truth , compounded a Lord Byron such as not to be any longer recognizable , and to become even  --  especially in France  --  a caricature . Of all this we shall speak hereafter . We shall now rather point to the curious than to the unjust character of this fact , and notice the contradictions to which Byron 's biographers have lent themselves . All , or nearly all , have granted to him an infinity of virtues , and naturally fine qualities  --  such as sensitiveness , generosity , frankness , humility , charity , soberness , greatness of soul , force of wit , manly pride , and nobility of sentiment ; but , at the same time , they do not sufficiently clear him of the faults which directly exclude the above-mentioned qualities . The moral man does not sufficiently appear in their writings : they do not sufficiently proclaim his character  --  one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? Are these virtues such that , like excellent and salutary substances , they become poisoned when placed in contact within the same crucible ? In this refusal to do justice there is contradiction ; and as error exists where contradiction lies , it is precisely in that contradiction that we must seek the means of refuting error and assert the power of truth . Nature always proceeds logically , and the effect is always in direct analogy with its cause . Even in the moral world the precise character of exact sciences must be found . If in a problem we meet with a contradiction , are we not certain that its solution has been badly worked out , and that we must begin it over again to find a true result ? The same reasoning holds good for the moral spheres . When a judgment has been wrongly formed , that is , when there appears to be contradiction between various opinions , that judgment must be remodelled , the cause of the error must be looked for , truth must be separated from falsehood , and regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weigh impartially every assertion , and to discuss equally the ayes and noes . Let this be done for Lord Byron . Let us analyze facts , question the eye-witnesses of his life , and peruse his admirable and simply-written letters , wherein his soul has , so to say , photographed itself . Acts are unquestionably more significative than words ; yet if we wish to inquire into his poetry , not by way of appreciating his genius ( with which at present we have nothing to do ) , but the nature of the man , let us do so loyally . Let us not attribute to him the character which he lends to his heroes , nor the customs which he attributes to them , simply because here and there he has given to the one something of his manner , to the other some of his sentiments ; or because he has harbored them , in the belief that hospitality can be extended to the wicked without the good suffering from it . Let us first examine " Childe Harold , "  --  the poem which principally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type of which we have already spoken . Childe Harold does not tell his own story . His life is told by a poet . There are , therefore , two well-marked personages on the scene , perfectly distinct and different from one another . The first is the young nobleman in whom Byron intended to personify the precocious perversion of mind and soul of the age , and in general the blased existence of the young men of the day , of whom he had met many types at Cambridge , and on his first launch into society . The second is the minstrel who tells his story . The heart of the former is closed to all joy and to all the finest impulses of the soul ; whereas that of the other beats with delight at the prospect of all that is noble , great , good , and just in the world . Why identify the author rather with the one than with the other  --  with the former rather than with the latter ? Why take from him his own sentiments , to give him those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysterious , since in his preface Byron tells us himself the moral object for which he has selected him . If Childe Harold personifies Lord Byron , who will personify the poet ? That poet ( and he is no other than Lord Byron ) plays a far greater part than the hero . He is much oftener on the scene . In the greater part of the poem the minstrel alone speaks . In the ninety-three stanzas of which the first canto is composed , Harold is on the scene during nineteen stanzas only , while the poet speaks in his own name during the seventy-four other stanzas , displaying a beautiful soul under various aspects , and exhibiting no melancholy other than that inherent to all elevated poetry . As for the second canto , it opens with a monologue of the minstrel , and Harold is forgotten until the sixteenth stanza . Then only does the melancholy hero appear , to disappear and reappear again for a few moments . But he rather seems to annoy the minstrel , who finishes at the seventy-third stanza by dismissing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canto the wretched and unamiable personage does not reappear . To whom , then , belong all the admirable sentiments and all the virtuous aspirations which we read of toward the end of the canto ?  --  to whom , if not to the minstrel himself ? that is , to Lord Byron . What poet has paid so noble a tribute to every virtue ? Could that vigor and freshness of mind which breathe upon the lips of the poet , and which well belonged to him , suit the corrupted nature of Harold ? If Byron dismisses his hero so often , it is because he experiences toward him the feelings of a logical moralist . Why then identify Lord Byron with a personage he himself disowns as his prototype , both in his notes , in his preface , in his conversations ; and who is proved by facts , by the poem itself , and by the poet 's logical and moral reasoning , to be entirely different from his creation ? It is true that Byron conceived the unfortunate idea of surrounding his hero by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the social circle to which he himself belonged , and to give him a mother and a sister , a disappointed love , a Newstead Abbey like his own , and to make him travel where he had travelled and experience the same adventures . That is true , and such an act of imprudence can only be explained , by the confidence on which he relied that the identification could never have been thought of . At twenty-one conscience speaks louder than experience . But if we can justify the accusation of his having been imprudent , can we justify his having been calumniated ? Eight years after the publication of the second canto , Byron wrote the third ; and here the pilgrim occasionally appears , but so changed that he seems to have been merged into the poet , and to form with him one person only . Childe Harold 's sorrows are those of Lord Byron , but there no longer exists any trace of misanthropy or of satiety . His heart already beats with that of the poet for chaste and devoted affections , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most sublime of sentiments . He loves the flowers , the smiling and glorious , the charming and sublime aspect of nature . " Yet not insensible to all which here Awoke the jocund birds to early song In glens which might have made even exile dear ; Though on his brow were graven lines austere , And tranquil sternness , which had ta'en the place Of feelings fiercer far but less severe , Joy was not always absent from his face , But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace . " No longer , then , is satiety depicted upon the pilgrim 's brow , but " lines austere ; " and the poet seems so desirous of proving to us that Harold is metamorphosed , that when he expresses sentiments full of sympathy , humanity , and goodness , his horror for war and his dislike for the beauties of the Rhine , because  --  " A thousand battles have assail 'd thy banks , " he takes care to add  --  " Thus Harold inly said " .... Harold , then , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who in the first canto remains unmoved in presence of the attractions of Florence the beautiful , who inspired the poet with such different sentiments that in the midst even of a storm which threatens to swallow him up he actually finds strength enough to express his sentiments of real love for the lovely absent one  --  of a love , indeed , which is evidently returned . His heart , like the poet 's , now beats with a pure love , and causes him to chant the absence of his friend in the most beautiful strain . Where is the old Harold ? It would seem as if the poet , tired of a companion so disagreeable and so opposed to his tastes , and wishing to get rid of him but not knowing how , had first changed and moulded him to his own likeness by giving him his own sentiments , his own great heart , his own pains , his own affections , and , not finding the change natural , had dismissed him altogether . And so it appears , for after the fifty-fifth stanza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus at the beginning of the fourth canto , which was published a year after , under the auspices of an Italian sky , the reader finds himself in the presence of the poet only . He meets in him a great and generous soul , but the victim of the most odious and unmerited persecution , who takes his revenge in forgiving the wrongs which are done to him , and who reserves all his energies to consecrate them to the love of that which is lovable , to the admiration of that which calls for it , and who at twenty-nine years of age is imbued with Christian and philosophical qualities , which his wearied hero could never have possessed . Why then again have identified Byron with Childe Harold ? For what reason ? It strikes us , that the simplest notions of fairness require us at least to take into account the words of the author himself , and to listen to the protestations of a man who despised unmerited praise more than unjust reproof . " A fictitious character , " says Byron , " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piece .... " It had been easy to varnish over his faults , to make him do more and express less , but he never was intended as an example , further than to show that early perversion of mind and morals leads to satiety of past pleasures and disappointment in new ones , and that even the beauties of nature and the stimulus of travel are lost on a soul so constituted , or rather misdirected . " It has been suggested to me by friends , on whose opinions I set a high value , that in this fictitious character , ' Childe Harold , ' I may incur the suspicion of having intended some real personage : this I beg leave once for all to disclaim  --  Harold is the child of imagination , for the purpose I have stated . In some very trivial particulars , and those merely local , there might be grounds for such a notion : but in the main points , I should hope , none whatever . " Warned by his friends of the danger which there was for him being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem . He had written it rather by way of recreation than for any other motive ; and when Dallas expressed to him his great desire to see the works published , Byron told him how unwilling he was that it should appear in print , and thus wrote to him , after having given way to Dallas 's wishes in the matter :  --  " I must wish to avoid identifying Childe Harold 's character with mine . If in certain passages it is believed that I wished to identify my hero with myself , believe that is only in certain parts , and even then I shall not allow it . As for the manor of Childe Harold being an old monastic residence , I thought I might better describe what I have seen than what I invent . I would not for worlds be a man like my hero . " A year after , in writing to Moore on the occasion of dedicating his " Corsair " to him , after saying that not only had his heroes been criticised , but that he had almost been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself , he adds : " Those who know me are undeceived , and those who do not I have little interest in undeceiving . I have no particular desire that any but my acquaintance should think the author better than the beings of his imagining ; but I can not help a little surprise , and perhaps amusement , at some odd critical exceptions in the present instance , when I see several bards in very reputable plight , and quite exempted from all participation in the faults of their heroes , who nevertheless might be found with little more morality than the Giaour ; and perhaps  --  but no  --  I must admit Childe Harold to be a very repulsive personage , and as to his identity , those who like it must give him whatever alias they please . " And in order to embrace the whole of his life in these quotations , we will add what he said at Cephalonia , to Dr. Kennedy , shortly before his death :  --  " I can not conceive why people will always mix up my own character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a poet , I have the right and liberty to draw . " " They certainly do not spare your lordship in that respect , " replied Kennedy ; " and in ' Childe Harold , ' ' Lara , ' the ' Giaour , ' and ' Don Juan , ' they are too much disposed to think that you paint in many instances yourself , and that these characters are only the vehicles for the expression of your own sentiments and feelings . " " They do me great injustice , " he replied , " and what was never before done to any poet .... But even in ' Don Juan ' I have been misunderstood . I take a vicious and unprincipled character , and lead him through those ranks of society whose high external accomplishments cover and cloak internal and secret vices , and I paint the natural effects of such characters , and certainly they are not so highly colored as we find them in real life . " " This may be true , " said Kennedy , " but the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but scenes of vice and folly ? " " To remove the cloak which the manners and maxims of society , " said his lordship , " throw over their secret sins , and show them to the world as they really are . You have not , " added he , " been so much in high and noble life as I have been ; but if you had fully entered into it , and seen what was going on , you would have felt convinced that it was time to unmask the specious hypocrisy , and show it in its native colors ! " Kennedy having then remarked that the lower and middling classes of society never entertained the opinion that the highest classes exhibited models of piety and virtue , and were , indeed , disposed to believe them worse than they really were , Byron replied :  --  " It is impossible you can believe the higher classes of society worse than they are in England , France , and Italy , for no language can sufficiently paint them . " " But still , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to improve them , and by what right , and under what title do you too come forward in this undertaking ? " " By the right , " he replied , " which every one has who abhors vice united with hypocrisy . My plan is to lead Don Juan through various ranks of society and show that wherever you go vice is to be found . " The doctor then observed , that satire had never done any good , or converted one man from vice to virtue , and that while his satires were useless , they would call upon his head the disapproval both of the virtuous and the wicked . " But it is strange , " answered Byron , " that I should be attacked on all sides , not only from magazines and reviews , but also from the pulpit . They preach against me as an advocate of infidelity and immorality , and I have missed my mark sadly in having succeeded in pleasing nobody . That those whose vices I depicted and unmasked should cry out is natural , but that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " said he , smiling , " that I am assisting you in my own way as a poet , by endeavoring to convince people of their depravity ; for it is a doctrine of yours  --  is it not ?  --  that the human heart is corrupted ; and therefore if I show that it is so in those ranks which assume the external marks of politeness and benevolence ,  --  having had the best opportunities , and better than most poets , of observing it ,  --  am I not doing an essential service to your cause , by first convincing them of their sins , and thus enabling you to throw in your doctrine with more effect ? " " All this is true , " said Kennedy ; " but you have not shown them what to do , however much you may have shown them what they are . You are like the surgeon who tears the bandages from the numerous wounds of his ulcerated patients , and , instead of giving fresh remedies , you expose them to the air and disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' How filthy these fellows are ! ' " " But I shall not be so bad as that , " said Lord Byron ; " you shall see what a winding up I shall give to the story . " The end was to justify and give a moral to every thing . While reproving , however , this system of identification , which not only leads to error but also to calumny , can it , however , be denied that there was not some reason , if not to justify it , at least to explain it ? To deny that there is , would , we think , be to commit another error . The nature of Lord Byron 's genius , the circumstances of his life , the innate qualities of his heart and soul , were unquestionably aids to his detractors . Upon the measure of the relations which existed between reality and fiction in his poems , and especially as applied to his own history , here are the words of Moore :  --  " As the mathematician of old required but a spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boasted , to move the world , so a certain degree of foundation in fact seemed necessary to Byron , before that lever which he knew how to apply to the world of the passions could be wielded by him . So small , however , was , in many instances , the connection with reality which satisfied him , that to aim at tracing through his stories these links with his own fate and fortunes , which were after all , perhaps , visible but to his own fancy , would be a task as uncertain as unsafe ; and this remark applies not only to the ' Bride of Abydos , ' but to the ' Corsair , ' ' Lara , ' and all the other beautiful fictions that followed , in which , though the emotions expressed by the poet may be in general regarded as vivid recollections of what had at different times agitated his own bosom , there are but little grounds , however he might himself occasionally encourage such a supposition , for connecting him personally with the groundwork or incidents of the stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the personal character of Byron and that of the poet would form a very curious psychological study . It would be even an act of justice toward his memory , but one which would prove too long , and would ill suit these pages . Let us merely declare , that both analogies and differences have existed , and that if the same can not be said of him as has been said of men of less renown , " the poet is different from the man , " it must be allowed that in Byron the two characters were associated without being coupled . This association did not exist between himself and the creatures of his fancy , but merely with the principal features of his poetry , their energy and sensitiveness . As to certain analogies between his heroes , or between them and himself , when they really exist , they should be pointed out ; the duty of criticism being to discern and to point to the nature and limits of these analogies . When Byron began his travels , his genius ever sought an outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had only made known what were his tendencies . The education of his genius began in his childhood , on the romantic banks of the Dee and on the shores of the ocean ; in the midst of the Scottish firs , in the house of his mother , which was peopled with relics of the past ; and at Newstead Abbey , situated in the heart of the romantic forest of Sherwood , which is surrounded by the ruins of the great Norman abbeys , and teems with traditional recollections of Robin Hood . The character of that sympathetic chief of the outlaws , who was a nobleman by birth , and who was always followed by the lovely Marian , dressed up as a page ; his generosity , his courage , his cleverness , his mixture of virtue and vice , his pride , his buoyant and chivalrous nature , his death even , which was so touching , must , to our mind , have produced a powerful impression upon one who , like Byron , was gifted with as much heart as imagination . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man himself , must have been influenced by these early impressions ; and , no doubt , Conrad , and other heroes of his early poems , must have sprung from the poet 's recollections of the legendary stories in the midst of which he had been nursed . In any case , however , the impressions which he had received did not affect his nature . He had , notwithstanding his youthful years , been able to show the measure , not the tendency of his genius , as well as his aversion for all that is artificial , superficial , insipid , and effeminate ; and he had proved that the two great characteristics of his nature were energy and sensitiveness . An education thus begun was to be continued and matured during his first voyage among scenes the most poetical and romantic in the world ; in the glorious East , where there exists a perpetual contrast between the passionate nature of man and the soft hue of the heavens under the canopy of which he lives . The manners , character , ideas , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet tamed down ; their energy , which often betrays itself in the perpetration of the greatest crimes , and as frequently in the practice of the finest qualities ; and the life which Byron was forced to lead among them , all produced a great impression upon his mind , and became precious materials to help the development of his intellect . In the same way that , as it has been said , Salvator Rosa 's encounters with bandits contributed to the development of his talent , so did the adventures of Lord Byron during this first journey contribute to form his particular taste . Had he always remained in the midst of extremely civilized nations , in which poetry and the great passions are lost , and the heart too often becomes cold , his mind might have developed itself in a less brilliant and original manner . It was this extraordinary union of energy and sensitiveness in Byron which was to determine the choice of subjects . No doubt the desire to produce an effect had a part in the selection , especially at the dawn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture of satiated pleasure as represented by Childe Harold , and in the strange nature of Manfred . But this is only a portion of the reality . His principal qualities were the real arbiters in the selection of subjects which he made . God has not given to us all the same voice . The largest trees  --  the oaks  --  require the help of storms to make their voices heard , while the reed only needs the help of the summer breeze . Byron 's attention was ever directed to what was uncommon , either in nature or in the human heart ; either in good or in evil , either in the ordinary course of things or beyond its limits . To the study of placid nature he preferred that of that soul which , though less well regulated , yet rises superior to fortune by its energy and will . The spark which lit up his genius could not live in that goodness which constituted the groundwork of his nature , but in passion , called forth by the sight of great misfortunes , great faults , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all which attracted or repelled him , which was most in harmony with his energetic character , or at greatest variance with his sensitive nature . One of the motives which actuated his mind was sympathy  --  the other , antipathy ; which exercised over him the same kind of fascination which the bird feels whom the serpent 's glance has fascinated , or like the unaccountable impulse which causes a man to throw himself down the precipice on the verge of which he stands . The various aspects of nature exercised a similar influence over him . With his exquisite sense of their beauties , Byron no doubt often described the enchanting climates in the midst of which he placed the action of his poems ; but his pen had always a manly action , with a mixture of grace and vigor in it quite inimitable . His descriptions , however , always appeared to be secondary objects in his mind , and rather constituted the frames which encircled the man whom he wished to depict . One would say that the soft beauties of a landscape and the playful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effeminate subjects for him to dwell upon . His preferences evidently point to the savage side of nature , to the struggles between physical forces , to the sublimities of the tempest , and almost , I would say , to a certain disorganization of nature ; provided , of course , all is restored to order the moment such a disorganization threatens the existence of beauty in art or in the moral world . At that time , what Byron could not find in his real and historical subject , he took from another reality , which was himself ,  --  that is , his own qualities , the circumstances of his life , his tastes ; without ever inquiring whether Conrad 's fear at the sight of the mysterious drop of blood on Gulnare 's forehead was that of Byron , whether the Venetian renegade Alp could really experience the horror which Byron did at Constantinople at the sight of dogs feasting upon human carcasses ; or whether the association of the qualities with which he idealized his heroes would not induce psychologists to accuse him of sinning against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . In this Lord Byron confided in his powers . He felt that the love of truth , and of what is beautiful , was too strong in him ever to depart from or cause him to violate the essential rules of art ; but he wished to remain a poet while trusting in reality . When he went to the East , and found himself there in contact with outward circumstances so in harmony with the natural bent of his views , and in presence of men like Ali Pasha , of whose victims he could almost hear the moans and the screams " in the clime " " Where all save the spirit of man is divine ; Where wild as the accents of lovers ' farewell Are the hearts which they bear and the tales which they tell , " he felt that he was at last in the land most likely to fire his natural genius , and to permit of his satisfying the imperious want which his observing mind constantly experienced of resting upon reality and upon truth . The terrible Ali Pasha of Yanina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ali Pasha , " says Galt , " is at the bottom of all his Oriental heroes . His ' Corsair ' is almost the history of Ali Pasha . " In the " Bride of Abydos " the old Giaffir is again Ali . As for " Lara , " it is thought that Byron conceived him on being very strongly impressed by the sight of a nobleman who was accused of murder , and who was pointed out to him at the Cagliari theatre . " I always thought , " says Galt , who was present on the occasion , " that this incident had a share in the conception of ' Lara , ' so small are the germs which fructify genius . " The " Giaour " is due to a personal adventure of Byron 's , in which he played , as was his wont , a most energetic and generous part . The origin of " Manfred " lies in the midst of sublime Alpine scenery , where , on a rock , Byron discovered an inscription bearing the names of two brothers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The history of Venice inspired him with Alp the renegade , who , disgusted with the unjust severities of his countrymen , turned Mohammedan and swore vengeance against the land of his birth . It is , however , indispensable to remark , that in each of these characters there are two distinct realities . The one tries , by a display of too much energy , to overstep the limits of the natural ; the other brings the subject back to its true proportions by idealizing it . The first is the result of the poet 's observations of men and their customs , or of his study of history ; the other , by the impossibility which he knows to exist in him of departing from the rules of art by pushing reality to the point of making of it a positive suffering . In the first case his heroes are like one another by their analogy in the use and abuse of strength ; in the other they are like Byron , because he has almost instilled a portion of his own life into them , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AEgean Sea : independent , haughty , terrible in battle , full of energy and daring such as becomes the chief of corsairs , and such as Byron 's study of the country where the action lies pointed out to him that such a man should be placed . But the poet describes himself when he makes Conrad , at the risk of his own life , save women from a harem , or shudder at the sight of a drop of blood on the brow of a lovely maiden . The spot on Gulnare 's forehead , while causing him to suspect some crime , banishes all her charms in his eyes , and inspires him with the greater horror from the fact that the love which she had sworn him probably inspired her with the foul act , to save his life and restore him to liberty . He accuses himself with having been the involuntary cause of it , and feels that his gratitude will be a torture ; his former love for Gulnare an impossibility . We find Byron 's own nature again in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in his passionate and ideal tenderness for Medora , whose love , in his eyes , surpasses all the happiness of this world , and whose death plunges him into irretrievable despair . In the " Siege of Corinth , " Alp is the real type of the historical Venetian renegade , who is incapable of forgiveness , and who makes use of all his energies to gratify his revenge . But he represents Byron when he speaks of the impressions which he felt under the starry canopy of heaven the night before the battle , when his imagination , taking him back to the happy , innocent days of his childhood , he contrasts them with the present , which for him is one of remorse , and when there glimmer still in his soul faint lights of humanity which make him turn away from the horrible sight of dogs devouring the dead bodies of men . Byron speaks in his own person in the introduction of the " Giaour , " which is replete with most exquisite beauty . In it he opens to the reader unexplored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all is joy for the senses , where all recollections are a feast for the soul , and where his love of moral beauty is as strongly marked in his praise of olden Greece , as is his condemnation of modern degraded Greece . Byron speaks again in his own name when he puts invectives in the mouth of the Mussulman fisherman , and makes him curse so strongly the crime of the Giaour and the criminal himself , whose despair is the expiation of his crimes and the beautiful triumph of morality . In the " Bride of Abydos " ( where the terrible Ali again comes forward in the shape of the old Giaffir ) the amiable and unfortunate Selim and the poet share the real sentiments of Byron . Byron is also himself when he adorns his heroine with every grace and perfection of body and soul , and also whenever it is necessary to idealize in order that a too rigorous imitation of reality may not offend either the laws of art or the feelings of the reader . As for " Don Juan , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserved the persecution which it brought upon him . Yet , if we judge the poem with no preconceived severity , we shall find that , with the exception of certain passages where he went beyond the limits prescribed to satire , from his hatred of hypocrisy , and also at times as a revenge against his persecutors , the poem is charming . These passages he intended to suppress , 1 but death prevented him . This is greatly to be regretted , for otherwise " Don Juan " would have been the most charming satirical poem in existence , and especially had not the last four cantos , written in Greece , been destroyed . The scene lay in England , and the views expressed in them explained many things which can never now be known . In allowing such an act to be committed for the sake of sparing the feelings of some influential persons and national susceptibilities , Byron 's friends failed in their duty to his memory , for the last four cantos gave the key to the previous ones , and justified them . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart against feeling ; and he kept to his resolution not to give way to his natural goodness of disposition , wishing the poem to be a satire as well as an act of revenge . Here and there , however , his great soul pierces through , and shows itself in such a true light that Byron 's portrait could be better drawn from passages of " Don Juan , " than from any other of his poems. 2 We have sufficiently proved , we think , that the uniform character of Byron 's heroes , which has been blamed by the poet 's enemies , was merely the reflection of the moral beauty which he drew from himself . It might almost be said that the qualities with which he had been gifted by Heaven conspired against him . We have been led to dwell upon this phase of his literary career , at the risk even of tiring the patience of the reader , from the necessity which we believe exists to destroy the phantom of identification which has been invoked , and to explain the moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet under other aspects . It is not in " Harold " or in " Conrad , " nor in any of his Oriental poems , that we are likely to trace the moral character of Byron , for , although it would be easy to detach the author 's sentiments from those of the personages of these poems , yet they might offer a pretext of blame to those who hate to look into a subject to discover the truth which does not appear at first sight . Nor is it in " Manfred "  --  the only one of his poems wherein , perhaps , reason may be said to be at fault , owing to the sickness under which his soul labored at the time when it was written , and to his diseased imagination , produced by solitude and unmerited grief . In his lyrical poems Byron 's soul must be sought . There he speaks and sings in his own name , expresses his own sentiments , breathes his own thoughts ; or , again , in his elegies and in his miscellaneous poems , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his satires  --  the noble and courageous independence of which has never been surpassed by any satirist , ancient or modern  --  and generally in all the poems which he wrote in Italy , and which might almost be called his second form . In these poems no medium is any longer required between his soul and that of the reader . It is not possible any longer to make any mistake about him in these . The melancholy and the energy displayed in them can not serve any more to give him the mask of a Conrad , or of a Harold , or of a misanthrope , or of a haughty individual , but they place in relief what there is of tender , amiable , affectionate sublime in those chosen beings whom God occasionally sends upon earth to testify here below of the things above :  --  " Per far di colassu fede fra noi. "  --  PETRARCH . Thus , in his elegy upon the death of Thyrza , " far too beautiful , " says Moore , " and too pure to have been inspired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitiveness ! What charm in his sonnets to Guinevre ! What soft melancholy , what profound and intimate knowledge of the immortality and spirituality of our soul , in his Hebrew melodies ! " They seem as though they had been inspired by Isaiah and written by Shakspeare , " says the Very Rev. Dr. Stanley , Dean of Westminster . What touching family affection in his domestic poems , and what generosity in the avowal of certain wrongs ! What great and moral feeling pervade the two last cantos of " Childe Harold , " melancholy though they be , like all things which are beautiful ! How one feels that the pain they tell of has its origin in unmerited persecution , and how his intellect came to his aid , and enabled him to bear with calmness the uncertainties incident to our nature ! What greatness of soul in the forgiveness of what to others would seem unpardonable ! What love of humanity and of its rights ! What hatred of injustice , tyranny , and oppression in the " Ode to Venice , " in " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dante , " and in general in all his latter poems , even in the " Isle , " a poem little known , which was written a short time before he left Genoa for Greece . Here , more than in any other of his poems , we see the admirable peace of mind which he had created for himself , and how far too high his great intellect soared to be any longer moved by the world 's injustice . Quotations from his poems would be impossible . How choose without regretting what has been discarded ? They must be read ; and those must be pitied who do not feel morally better after having read them . This is precisely what has been least done up to the present time : people have been content with reading his early poems , and with seeking Byron in " Childe Harold " or in the heroes of his Oriental poems ; which is about as just as to look for Shakspeare in Iago , Milton in Satan , Goethe in Mephistopheles , or Lamartine in the blasphemies of his ninth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man with the imaginary beings of his poems , and neglecting to seek him where they could have found him , relying upon judgments formed in England , and too often by people prejudiced against Byron ,  --  have themselves adopted false views with respect to the author and his works . Thus , again , poetry  --  which without any preconceived teaching or any particular doctrine of its own , without transgressing the rules laid down by art , moved the soul , purified and elevated it , and taught it to despise the base and cowardly desires of nature , and excited in it the admiration of all that is noble and heroic ,  --  was declared to be suspicious even in France , because too often it had proclaimed openly the truth where one would have wished truth to have been disguised . Many would fain have thought otherwise , but they preferred remaining silent , and to draw from that poetry the poetical riches of which they might be in want . Our intention being to consecrate a chapter to the examination of the moral tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . We must add , however , that these views which had been so easily adopted in France were not those of the majority of right-thinking persons in England , although they dared not proclaim their opinions then as they can now . I shall only quote the opinion of two Englishmen of great merit ( Moore and Sir Egerton Brydges ) , who can neither one nor the other be suspected of partiality ; the first , on account of his great fear of ever wounding the susceptibilities of his countrymen , the other by the independence and nobility of his character . " How few are the pages in his poems , " says Moore , " even if perused rapidly , which by their natural tendency toward virtue , or some splendid tribute to the greatness of God 's works , or by an explosion of natural piety more touching than any homily , do not entitle him to be admitted in the purest temple of which Christianity may have the keep ! "  --  Moore , vol. ii . Sir Egerton Brydges , after having fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " They give to the reader 's best instincts an impulse which elevates , purifies , instructs , charms , and affords us the noblest and purest of joys . "  --  Sir E. Brydges , vol. x. p. 141 . These quotations perhaps will be found too many , but are they not necessary ? Is truth which can be so easily changed equally easy to re-establish ? Are not a thousand words wanted to restore a reputation which a light word or , may be , slight malice has tarnished ? If the author of these pages only expressed individual opinions without adducing any proof , that is to say , without accompanying them with the disinterested and enlightened testimonies of people who have known Byron personally , these volumes might gain in interest by being condensed in a shorter space . But in shortening the road would the author attain the desired end ? would the self-imposed task be fulfilled ? would his or her own convictions become those of others ? Should not authors sacrifice themselves to their subject in all works inspired by a devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished to prove what had already been conceded by every body ? that the value of the proofs adduced is lessened by the fact that they are nearly all already known ? In answer , and without noticing the words " nearly all , " he might say that , as truth has several aspects , one may almost , without mentioning new facts , arrive at being what might be called the guide in the tour round the soul , and fathom its depth in search of the reality ; just as when we have looked at all the sides of a picture , we return to it , in order to find in it fresh beauties which may have escaped our notice on a first inspection . There are certain souls , to fathom which it is absolutely necessary to employ a retrospective method ; in the same way that the pictures , for instance , of Salvator Rosa enchant on close inspection of the great beauties which in some lights seem hid by a mass of clouds . " One can hardly employ too many means , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is , to understand him to be something more than an intellectual being . As long as we have not asked ourselves a certain number of questions about such and such an author , and as long as they have not been satisfactorily answered , we are not sure of having completely made him out , even were such questions to be wholly irrelevant to the subjects upon which he has written . " What did he think upon religious matters ? " How did the aspect of nature affect him ? " How did he behave in regard to women ? " How about money ? " What rules did he follow ? " What was his daily life ? etc. , etc . " Finally , what was his peculiar vice and foible ? Every man has one . " Not one of these questions is unimportant in order to appreciate an author or his book , provided the book does not treat of pure mathematics ; and especially if it is a literary work , that is to say , a book wherein there is something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eminent critic our rule and an encouragement to our efforts . We are well aware that in France , now-a-days , writers do not like to use the same materials in describing a character as are used by other nations , and especially by England . A study of this kind in France must not be a judgment pronounced upon the individual who is the object of it , and still less an inquiry . The qualities and defects of a man of genius do not constitute the principal business of the artist . Man is now rather examined as a work of art or as an object of science . When reason has made him out , and intellectual curiosity has been satisfied , the wish to understand him is not carried out further . The subject is abandoned , lest the reader may be tired . This may be good reasoning in many cases ; but in the present perhaps the best rule is " in medio tutissimus . " When a good painting is spoilt by overpolish , to wash the polish off is not to restore it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result , however , no pains should be spared ; and upon this principle we must act with regard to Byron . In psychological studies the whole depends upon all the parts , and what may at first seem unimportant may prove to be the best confirmation of the thesis . To be stopped by details ( I might almost say repetitions ) would therefore be to exhibit a fear in adducing proof . Can it be said that we have not sufficiently condemned ? To add this interest to the volume would not have been a difficult task . To attack is easier than to defend ; but we should then have had to invent our facts , and , at the same time , to add romance to history . The world , says a great moralist of our times , prefers a vice which amuses it rather than a virtue which bores it ; but our respect for the reader convinces us that the adoption of such a means of arriving at success would forfeit their respect for us and be as repugnant to their sense of justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means have more than once been employed , and with the more success by those who have united to their skill the charms of style . But in claiming no talent , no power to interest , and in refusing to appear as an author from motives of pusillanimity , idleness , or self-love , is one less excusable for hiding the truth when one is acquainted with it ? If it is the duty of a man of honor and a Christian to come to the rescue of a victim to violence when it is in one 's power , is it not incumbent upon one to raise a voice in the defense of those who can no longer resent an insult , when we know that they are wrongly accused ? To be silent under such circumstances would be productive of remorse ; and the remorse is greater when felt on the score of those whose genius constitutes the monopoly of the whole world , and forms part of the common treasure of humanity , which enjoins that it should be respected . Is not their reputation a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outraged would , in our minds , be as culpable as to hide a portion of a treasure which is not our own . " Truth , " says Lamartine , " does not require style . Its light shines of itself ; its appearance is its proof . " In publishing these pages , written conscientiously and scrupulously , we confide in the opinion expressed above in the magic language of the man who can create any prestige . If the reader finds these guarantees of truth sufficient , and deigns to accept our conscientious remarks with indulgence and kindness ; if , after examining Byron 's character under all its aspects , after repeating his words , recalling his acts , and speaking of his life  --  especially of that which he led in Italy  --  and mentioning the various impressions which he produced upon those who knew him personally , we are justified in the reader 's opinion in having endeavored to clear the reality from all the clouds which imagination has gathered round the person of Byron , and in trying to earn for his memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the antipathy which falsehood has hitherto obtained for him , our object will have been obtained . To endeavor to restore Byron 's reputation is the more necessary , since Moore himself , who is his best biographer , failed not only in his duty as a friend , but as the historian of the poet 's life : for he knew the truth , and dared not proclaim it . Who , for instance , could better inform us of the cause which led to Byron 's separation from his wife ? And yet Moore chose to keep the matter secret . Who was better acquainted with the conduct of Byron 's colleagues at the time of his conjugal differences  --  with the curious proposals which were made to him by them to recover their good graces  --  with his refusal to regain them at such a cost  --  with the persecution to which he was , after that , subjected  --  with the names of the people who instigated a popular demonstration against him  --  with all the bad treatment which obliged him to quit England ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than Moore , could tell of the friends on whom Byron relied , and who at the time of his divorce sided with Lady Byron , and even went so far as to aggravate the case by falsely publishing reports of his having ill-treated Lady Byron and discharged loaded guns in order to frighten her ? Who was better acquainted with the fact that the last cantos of " Don Juan , " written in Greece , had been destroyed in England , and that the journal which he kept after his departure from Genoa had been destroyed in Greece ? Moore knew it very well , and did not reveal these facts , lest he should create enemies for himself . He actually went so far as to pretend that Byron never wrote any thing in Greece. 5 Who better than Moore knew that Byron was not irreligious ?  --  And yet he pretended that he was . And finally , Who was better aware that Byron 's greatest aim was to be useful to humanity , and yet encouraged the belief that Byron 's expedition to Greece was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as a superior man ? In a few words , Moore has not made the best of Byron 's qualities , has kept silence over many things which might have enhanced his character in public opinion ; and wished , above all , to show the greatness of his poetical genius , which was never questioned . One would almost say that Moore did not like Byron to be too well spoken of : for whenever he praises , he ever accompanies the praise with a blame , a " but " or an " if ; " and instead of openly contradicting accusations which he knew to be false , and honestly proclaiming the truth , he , too , preferred to excuse the poet 's supposed shortcomings . Moore was wanting in courage . He was good , amiable , and clever ; but weak , poor , and a lover of rank  --  where , naturally , he met with many political enemies of Byron . He , therefore , dared not then tell the truth , having too many interests to consider . Hence his concessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and in many cases , when it was a question between the departed Byron and one of his high detractors , the one sacrificed was the dead friend who could no longer defend himself . All such considerations for the living were wrongs toward the memory of Byron . The gravest accusation , however , to which Moore is open is , that he did not preserve the Memoirs which Byron gave him on the sworn condition that nothing should prevent their publication . The promise thus given had restored peace to Byron 's mind , so confident was he that it would be fulfilled . To have broken his word is a crime for which posterity will never forgive Moore . Can it be alleged , by way of excuse , that he gave extracts from it ? But besides the authenticity of the extracts , which might be questioned , of what value can be a composition like Moore 's in presence of Byron 's very words ? No one can pretend to be identified with such a mind as Byron 's in the expression of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Moore 's . The " Memoirs , " then , which were the justification of Byron 's life ; the last cantos , which were the justification of the poet and of the man ; the journal , which showed his prudence and sagacity beyond his age , which by the simple relation of facts proved how he had got rid of all the imperfections of youth , and at last become the follower of wisdom , so much so that he would have been one of the most virtuous men in England  --  all have been lost to the world : they have descended with him into the tomb , and thus made room for the malice of his detractors . Hence the duty of not remaining silent on the subject of this highly-gifted man . In restoring , however , facts to their true light , we do not pretend to make Byron appear always superior to humanity in his conduct as a man and a poet . Could he , with so sensitive and passionate a nature as his was , and living only that period when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from age no longer are affected by them ? If it is easy not to give way to our passions at seventy , is it equally so at twenty or at thirty ? Persecuted as he was , could Byron be expected to remain unmoved ? If his passion for truth made him inexorable in some of his poems ; if his passion for justice allowed his pen at times to go beyond the limits which it should have respected ; if even at times he was unjust , because he had been too much injured and irritated ,  --  he undoubtedly would have compensated for his involuntary and slight offenses , had he not been carried off so early . As for the imperfection of these pages ,  --  once we have dissipated error , and caused truth to be definitely received as regards Byron ,  --  an abler pen can easily correct it , and do away with the numberless repetitions with which we are aware we shall be reproached . We could not do otherwise , as we wished to multiply proofs . Others , some day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our work is like the stream which falls from the mountain and is filled with ooze : its only merit is to swell the river into which it runs . But , sooner or later , a stronger current will purify it , and give clearness and brilliancy to it , without taking from it the merit of having increased the bulk of the waters . Such as it is , we dedicate this humble work to the noble souls who worship truth . They will feel that we have been able to place them in a more intimate connection with another great mind , and thus we shall have gained our reward . FOOTNOTES : Footnote 1 : He often told and promised his friends at Genoa that he would alter the passages which are unjust and reprehensible , and that , before it was finished , " Don Juan " would become a chaste and irreproachable satire .

Footnote 4 : When the persecution to which Lord Byron was exposed by his separation had attained its greatest height , an influential person  --  not belonging to the peerage  --  came to visit him , and told him that , if he wished to see how far the folly of men went , he had only to give orders for having it shown that nothing said against him was true , but that then he must change politics and come over to the Tory party . Lord Byron replied that he would prefer death and all kinds of tortures to such meanness . Hereupon the person in question said that he must suffer the consequences , which would be heavy , since his colleagues were determined on his ruin , out of party spirit and political hatred . It was at this time that , going one day to the House , he was insulted by the populace , and even treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , nor approached to give any explanation of such a proceeding , except Lord Holland , who was always kind to him , and indeed to every one else . Others  --  such as the Duke of Sussex , Lord Minto , Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey  --  would fain have acted in a like manner ; but they suffered themselves to be influenced by his enemies , among whom more than one was animated by personal rancor because the young lord had laughed at them and shown up their incapacity . Lord Byron , finding himself received in this way by his colleagues , pretended not to see it , and after a few moments quitted the House , never more to set foot within it . Footnote 5 : Lord Byron 's mind , incapable of idleness , was constantly at work , even despite himself and amid pressing active occupations . During his stay in the Ionian Islands , Missolonghi , he wrote five cantos of Don Juan . The scene of the cantos that followed was laid first in England and then in Greece . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most interesting , and , besides , they explained a host of things quite justifying them . They were taken to England with Lord Byron 's other papers ; but there they were probably considered not sufficiently respectful toward England , on which they formed a sort of satire too outspoken with regard to living personages , and doubtless it was deemed an act of patriotism to destroy them . And so the world was deprived of them . Lord Byron had also kept a journal since the day of his departure from Genoa up to the time when illness made the pen drop from his hand . To it he had consigned his most intimate thoughts ; and we may well imagine how full of interest it must have been , written amid all the emotions agitating his soul at that time . This journal was found among his papers by a personage of high standing in Greece , who was the first to inspect them , and who , seeing his own name and conduct mentioned in no flattering terms , destroyed them in order to hide from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often speaks of this journal in the letters addressed at this period to his sister . We leave the reader to make his own comments on these too regrettable facts . CHAPTER I. LORD BYRON AND M. DE LAMARTINE . To Count de  --   --  . Paris , 17th June , 1860 . MY DEAR COUNT ,  --  Confiding in your willingness to oblige , I beg to ask a favor and your advice . I received , a short time ago , a prospectus of a subscription to be raised for a general addition of the works of M. de Lamartine . You are aware that when it is a question of showing my sympathy for M. de Lamartine I would never miss the opportunity of doing so ; but on this occasion I see on the programme the promise of a Life of Lord Byron . Such an announcement must alarm the friends of that great man ; for they remember too vividly the sixteenth number of the " Cours Litteraire " to subscribe hastily to a work when they have not more information than is therein given . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange judgment of Byron formed by M. de Lamartine in that article . Identifying the man with the poet , and associating his great name with that of Heine on account of some rather hazardous lines in " Don Juan , " and forgetting the license allowed to such poetry  --  an imitation of the Italian poets Berni , Ariosto , Pulci , Buratti  --  M. de Lamartine did not forget a few personal attacks upon himself , and called Byron the founder of the school for promoting satanic laughter , while he heaped upon him the most monstrous accusations . M. de Lamartine ventured to say of Byron things which even his greatest enemies never dared to utter at that time when in England it was the custom to revile him . Although the time has not yet come when Lord Byron 's life should be written , since the true sources of collecting information respecting him are unattainable so long as the people live to whom his letters were addressed , still it is easy to perceive that the time has at length arrived when in England the desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is felt by the nation generally . Moore , Parry , Medwin , etc. , have already attempted to make known the character of the man as distinct from that of the poet . They no longer sought to find in him a resemblance with Childe Harold , or the Corsair , or Manfred , or Don Juan , nor to judge of him by the conversations in which he sought to mystify those with whom he conversed ; but they judged him by his acts and by his correspondence . If so happy a reaction , however , is visible in England the same can not be said of France , where there being no time to read what is published elsewhere , an error is too soon embraced and ingrafted on the mind of the public as a consequence of a certain method which dispenses with all research . Hence the imaginary creation which has been called Byron , and which has been maintained in France notwithstanding its being wholly unacceptable as a portrait of the man , and totally different from the Byron known personally to some happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsomest , the most amiable of men , and the greatest genius whom God has created . But M. de Lamartine , who wishes particularly to show the character of the man , instead of adding to the numerous proofs of courage and grandeur of mind which he has personally shown to the world  --  that of confessing that he has erred in his judgment of Byron  --  endeavors to study him only in his works . But in doing this , and even though a moral object may be found in each of Byron 's works , it strikes us that M. de Lamartine would have done better to pursue this line in the analysis of the intellectual part of the man , and not the moral side . " You err " ( wrote Byron to Moore on the occasion of the latter saying that such a poem as the " Vision of Judgment " could not have been written in a desponding mood ) : " a man 's poetry is a distinct faculty or soul , and has no more to do with the every-day individual than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To which Moore observes : " My remark has been hasty and inconsiderate , and Lord Byron 's is the view borne out by all experience . Almost all the tragic and gloomy writers have been , in social life , mirthful persons . The author of the ' Night Thoughts ' was a fellow of infinite jest ; and of the pathetic Otway , Pope says , ' He ! why , he would laugh all the day long ; he would do nothing but laugh ! ' " It is known that many licentious writers have led very regular and chaste lives ; that many who have sung their success with women have not dared to declare their love to one woman ; that all Sterne 's sentiment was perfectly ideal , and proceeded always from the head and never from the heart ; that Seneca 's morality was no barrier to his practicing usury ; and that , according to Plutarch , Demosthenes was a very questionable moralist in practice . Why , then , necessarily conclude that a moralist is a moral man , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who describes scenes of blood and carnage a monster of cruelty ? Does not Montaigne say of authors that they must be judged by their merits , and not by their morals , nor by that show of works which they exhibit to the world ? Why , then , does M. Lamartine appreciate Byron according to his satirical works , when all those who knew him assert that his real character was very different to his literary one ? He did not personify , but create his heroes ; which are two very different things . Like Salvator Rosa , who , the meekest of men in private life , could only find a vent to his talent by painting scenes of brigandage and horror , so did Byron 's genius require to go down into the darkest recesses of the passions which generate remorse , crime , and heroism , to find that spark which fired his genius . But it must be owned , that even his great qualities were causes of the false judgment of the world upon him . Thus , in describing Childe Harold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had not yet been seen . At the scenes of despair , at the scenes of doubt which assail him , the poet assists rather as the historian than as the actor . And the same holds good for other poems , where he describes those peculiar diseases of the mind which great geniuses alone can comprehend , though they need not have experienced them . But it was the very life which he infused into his heroes that made it appear as if they could not personify any one but himself . And as to their faults , because he was wont to give them his qualities , it was argued , that since the latter were observable to be common to the author and the creations of his fancy , the faults of these must likewise be his . If only the faults , why not also the crimes ? Thus it came that , caring little for their want of argument , Byron 's enemies erected themselves into avengers of too much talent bestowed upon one single man . Byron might have taken up his own defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did it carelessly in some letters written to intimate friends . To Moore he wrote :  --  " Like all imaginative men , I , of course , embody myself with the character while I draw it ; but not a moment after the pen is from the paper . " He always , however , begged that he might be judged by his acts ; and a short time before he died at Missolonghi , after recommending Colonel Stanhope to desist from then pressing the necessity of giving liberty to the press , and from recommending the works of Bentham to a people who could not even read , Byron replied to the colonel 's rather hasty remarks , " Judge me by my acts . " This request he had often repeated , as his life was not one of those which fear the light of day . All in vain . His enemies were not satisfied with this means of putting an end to their calumnies . Where does M. de Lamartine find the truth which he proposes to tell the world about Byron ? Not surely among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge or of speculation , and sometimes both . Not in the conversations which Byron had with several people , and on the credulity of whom he loved to speculate . It can not , therefore , be in the biographies of men who have written erroneously , and have not understood their subject ; but in Moore , in Parry , in Count Gamba 's works , and , may be , in a few others . I am , however , far from saying , that Moore has acted toward Lord Byron with all that friendly feeling which Byron recommended to him on asking him to write the Life of Sheridan , " without offending the living or insulting the dead . " Quite the contrary . I take it that Moore has wholly disregarded his duties as a true friend , by publishing essentially private letters , by introducing into his books certain anecdotes which he might , if even they were true , have advantageously left out ; and in failing , from fear of wounding living susceptibilities , to assert with energy that which he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one , Moore experienced the fatal influence which injures independence in aristocratic England . An Irishman by birth , and a commoner , Moore was flattered to find himself elevated by his talents to a position in aristocratic circles which he owed to his talents , but which he was loath to resign . The English aristocracy then formed a kind of clique whose wish it was to govern England on the condition that its secret of governing should not be revealed , and was furious with Byron , who was one of them , for revealing their weaknesses and upbraiding their pretensions . Moore wished to live among the statesmen and noblemen whose despotic views and bad policy Byron had openly condemned , and among those lovely islanders in whose number there might be found more Adelinas than Auroras , and to whom Byron had preferred foreign beauties . Moore , in short , wished to live with the literary men whom Byron had ridiculed in his satires , and among the high clergy , then as intolerant as they were hypocritical , and who , as Byron said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose necessity it had become to live among these open revilers and enemies of Byron , after allowing the memoirs of Byron to be burnt , because in them some of the above-named personages were unmasked , this Moore was weak enough not to proclaim energetically that Byron 's character was as great as his genius , but to do so only timidly . By way of obtaining pardon even for this mite of justice to the friend who was gone , Moore actually condescended to associate himself with those who pleaded extenuating circumstances for Byron 's temper , like Walter Scott and other poets . But truth comes out , nevertheless , in Moore ; and in the perusal of Byron 's truthful and simple letters we find him there displayed in all his admirable and unique worth as an intellectual and a moral man . We find him adorned with all the virtues which Heaven gave him at his birth ; his real goodness , which neither injustice nor misfortune could alter ; his generosity , which not only made him disbelieve in ingratitude , but actually incited him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " he could not keep his resentments ; " his gratitude for the little that is done for him ; his sincerity ; his openness of character ; his greatness and disinterestedness . " His very failings were those of a sincere , a generous , and a noble mind , " says a biographer who knew him well . His contempt for base actions ; his love of equity ; his passion for truth , which was carried almost to a hatred of cant and hypocrisy , were the immediate causes of his want of fairness in his opinion of himself and of his self-accusation of things most contrary to his nature . So singular a trait in his character was by no means the result of eccentricity , but the result of an exceptional assembly of rare qualities which met for the first time in one man , and which , shining in the midst of a most corrupt society , constituted almost more an anomaly which became a real defect , hurtful , however , to himself only . His ideal of the beautiful magnified weaknesses into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that with the saints the slightest transgression of the laws appears at once in the light of mortal sin . St. Augustin calls the greediness of his youth a crime . The result of all this was that his very virtues mystified the world and caused it to believe that the faults which he attributed to himself were nothing in comparison of those which he really had . Byron , however , was indignant at being so unfairly treated . He treated with contempt the men who calumniated him , and as if they were idiots . He can safely , therefore , be blamed for not urging enough his own defense . This , to my mind , constitutes his capital fault , unless one considers defects of character those changes of humor which rapidly passed from gayety to melancholy , or his pretended irritability , which was merely a slight disposition to be impatient . These were all the result of his poetical nature , added to the effects of early education and to those of certain family circumstances . It would be too hard and too unfair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius to a bad nature or to misanthropy . Had Lord Byron not been impatient he must have been satisfied with his own condition and indifferent to that of others . In other words , he must have been an egotist , which he was not . He was gay by nature , and repeatedly showed it ; but he had been sorely wounded by the injustice of men , and his marriage with Miss Milbank had undermined his peace and happiness . How , then , could he escape the occasional pangs of grief , and not betray outwardly the pain which devoured him inwardly . In such moments it was a relief to him to heave a sigh , or take up a pen to vent his grief in rhyme . His misanthropy was quite foreign to his nature . All those who knew him can bear testimony to the falseness of the accusation . Moore , who knew him so well , and who always speaks the truth when no longer under the influences which at times overpower him , after speaking of the charm of Byron 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends by saying : " It may be asserted that never did there exist before , and it is most probable never will exist again , a combination of such vast mental power and surpassing genius , with so many others of those advantages and attractions by which the world is in general dazzled and captivated . " When , therefore , M. de Lamartine seeks the truth in Moore , Parry , and some other biographers respecting Byron , he will find that this eminently beautiful form was in harmony with the splendid intellect and moral qualities of the man . M. de Lamartine will see that Byron was a good and devoted son , a tender father and brother , a faithful friend , and indulgent master , beloved by all who ever knew him , and who was never accused , even by his enemies , of having tried to seduce an innocent young girl , or having disturbed the peace of conjugal bliss . He will behold his charity , which was universal and unbounded ; a pride which never stooped to be subservient of those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public dignities , so far as they reflected glory upon himself ; and such a spirit of humility that he was ever ready to blame himself and follow the advice of those whom he deemed to be animated by no hostile spirit against himself . When M. de Lamartine sees all this , not merely written down as in these pages , but actually proved by facts and irrefutable testimonies , his loyal soul must revolt and wish to do justice to himself by rejecting his former opinions . He will understand that if he himself has been called a drinker of blood by the party whom he styles bigoted and composed of old men , Byron , too , may have been calumniated . Looking , then , at the great poet in his proper light , that is , in the plenitude of his rare qualities , and considering him under each of the circumstances of his life , M. de Lamartine will own that he had misunderstood that most admirable of characters , and grant that the " satanic laughter " of which he spoke was , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might have lighted up by its magic soft rays the dark regions of Satan . His doubts being cleared away , M. de Lamartine will end by saying that Byron was an " angel , not a demon . " Byron 's misfortune was to have been born in the England of those days . Do you remember his beautiful lines in the " Due Foscari ? "  --  " He might have lived , So formed for gentle privacy of life , So loving , so beloved ; the native of Another land , and who so bless 'd and blessing As my poor Foscari ? Nothing was wanting Unto his happiness and mine save not To be Venetian . " In writing these lines Byron must have thought of his own fate . He was scarcely British by origin , and very little so by his turn of mind , or by his tastes or by the nature of his genius . " My ancestors are not Saxon , they are Norman , " he said ; " and my blood is all meridian . " If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come before the world when his star would have been hailed with the same love and regard that was granted to Dante in Italy , to Chateaubriand and Lamartine in France , or to Goethe in Germany , who would ever have blamed him for the slight errors which fell from his pen in " Don Juan , "  --  a poem written hastily and with carelessness , but of which it can be said , as Montesquieu said of the prettiest women , " their part has more gravity and importance than is generally thought . " If the sense of the ridiculous is ever stronger among people whose appreciation of the beautiful is keenest , who more than Byron could have possessed it to a higher degree ? Is it therefore to be marvelled at that , in order to make the truth he revealed accessible to all , and such whose minds had rusted in egotism and routine , he should have given to them a new and sarcastic form ? Had he been born anywhere but in the England of those days , he never would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reality of character , and not that superficial form which he saw existed then in society . He believed it right to scorn the appearances of virtue put on only for the purpose of reaping its advantages . No one respected more than he did all that was really holy , virtuous , and respectable ; but who could blame him for wishing to denounce hypocrisy ? As for his supposed skepticism , and his expressions of despair , they may be classed with the misgivings of Job , of Pascal , of Lamartine , of Chateaubriand , and of other great minds , for whom the unknown world is a source of constant anxiety of thought , and whose cry of despair is rather a supplication to the Almighty that He would reveal himself more to their eyes . It must be borne in mind that the skepticism which some lines in his poems denounce is one of which the desponding nature calls more for our sympathy than our denunciations , since " we discover in the midst of these doubts , " says Moore , " an innate piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His own words should be remembered when he writes , as a note to the two first cantos of " Childe Harold , " that the spirit of the stanzas reflects grief and illness , more than an obstinate and mocking skepticism ; and so they do . They do not embody any conclusions , but are only the expression of a passionate appeal to the Almighty to come to the rescue and proclaim the victory of faith . Could any thing but a very ordinary event be seen in his separation from a wife who was in no way suited to him , and whose worth can be esteemed by the remark which she addressed to Byron some three weeks after her marriage : " When , my lord , do you intend to give up your habit of versifying ? " And , alas ! could he possibly be happy , born as he was in a country where party prejudices ran so high ? where his first satire had created for him so many enemies ? where some of his poems had roused political anger against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not patiently bear with the hypocrisy of those who surrounded him , and where , in fact , he had had the misfortune to marry Miss Milbank ? The great minds whom God designs to be the apostles of truth on earth , make use for that purpose of the most efficacious means at their disposal . The universal genius of Byron allowed of his making use of every means to arrive at his end . He was able to be at once pathetic , comic , tragical , satirical , vehement , scoffing , bitter , and pleasant . This universality of talents , directed against Englishmen , was injurious to his peace of mind . When Byron went to Italy his heart was broken down with real and not imaginary sorrows . These were not of that kind which create perfection , but were the result of an unheard-of persecution on account of a family difference in which he was much more the victim than the culprit . He required to live in a milder climate , and a softer atmosphere to breathe in . He found both at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new turn , which had remained undeveloped while in his own clouded country . In the study of Italian literature he met with the Bernesque poetry , which is so lightly and elegantly sarcastic . He made the acquaintance of Buratti , the clever and charming satirist . He began , himself , to perceive the baseness of men , and found in an aesthetical mockery of human failings the most copious of the poetical currents of his mind . The more his friends and his enemies told him of the calumnies which were uttered against him , so much the more did Byron 's contempt swell into disdain ; and to this circumstance did " Beppo " and " Don Juan " owe their appearance . The social condition of his country and the prevalent cant opened to him a field for reflection at Venice , where customs were so different and manners so tolerant . Seeing new horizons before him , he was more than ever disgusted at the judgments of those who calumniated him , and ended by believing it to be best to laugh at their silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and afterward " Don Juan . " He was mistaken , however , in believing that in England this new style of poetry would be liked . His jests and sarcasms were not understood by the greater portion of those against whom they were levelled . The nature of the Bernese poetry being essentially French , England could not , with its serious tendencies , like a production in which the moral purpose was artistically veiled . From that day forward a severance took place between Byron and his countrymen . What had enchanted the French displeased them , and Byron in vain translated the " Morgante " of Pulci , to show them what a priest could say in that style of poetry in a Catholic country . In vain did he write to his friends that " Don Juan " will be known by-and-by for what it is intended ,  --  a satire on the abuses of the present state of society , and not a eulogy of vice . It may be now and then voluptuous : I ca n't help it . Ariosto is worse ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl will ever be seduced by reading " Don Juan , " etc . But he was blamed just because he jested . To his ultramontane tone they would have preferred him to blaspheme in coarse Saxon . One of the best of Byron 's biographers asserts that he was a French mind lost on the borders of the Thames . Lord Byron had every kind of mind , and that is why he was equally French . But in addressing his countrymen , as such , he heaped a mountain of abuse upon his head . With the most moral portion of the English public a violent satire would have had better chance of success . With the higher classes the work was read with avidity and pleasure . It was not owned , because there were too many reasons for condemning it ; but it found its way under many a pillow , to prove to the country how virtue and patriotism were endangered by this production . Murray made himself the echo of all this wrath , and Lord Byron , not able at times to contain his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I intend to write my best work in Italian , and I am working at it . As for the opinion of the English , which you mention , let them know how much it is worth before they come and insult me by their condescension . " I have not written for their pleasure ; if they find theirs in the perusal of my works , it is because they wish it . I have never flattered their opinion or their pride , nor shall I ever do so . I have no intention either of writing books for women or to ' dilettar le femine e la plese . ' I have written merely from impulse and from passion , and not for their sweet voices . I know what their applause is worth ; few writers have had more . They made of me a kind of popular idol without my ever wishing , and kicked me down from the pedestal upon which their caprice had raised me . But the idol did not break in the fall , and now they would raise it again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that Byron was perfectly happy in Italy , and that their abuse did him but very little harm , they gave full vent to their rage . They had shown how little they knew him when they identified him with his heroes ; they found that they knew even less of him when he appeared to them in the reality of his character . Calumny followed upon calumny . Unable to find him at fault , they interpreted his words themselves , and gave them a different meaning . Every thing was figurative of some wickedness , and to the simplest expressions some vile intention was attributed . They depreciated his works , in which are to be found such admirable and varied types of women characters , that they even surpass in beauty those of Shakspeare ( Angiolina , Myrrha , Anna ) : they said that Faliero wanted interest , that Sardanapalus was a voluptuary ; that Satan in " Cain " did not speak as a theologian ( how could he ? ) , that there were irreverent tendencies in his sacred dramas  --  and finally that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean , Earth , air , stars ,  --  all that springs from the great Whole , Who hath produced , and will receive the soul , " was hazardous , and almost that of an atheist . Atheist ! he ! who considered atheists fools . On leaving Venice for Ravenna , 6 where he had spent a few months , only by way of distraction in the midst of his sorrows and serious occupations , he was accused of dissolute conduct ; and the serious attachment which he had wished to avoid , but which had mastered his whole heart , and induced him to live an isolated life with the person he loved in a town of Romagna , far from all that could flatter his vanity and from all intercourse with his countrymen , was brought against him to show that he lived the life of an Epicurean , and brought misery into the heart of families . All this , no doubt , might have again called for his contempt , but on his way from Ravenna to Pisa he wrote the outpourings of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are :  --  " Oh Fame ! if I e'er took delight in thy praises , ' T was less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases , Than to see the bright eyes of the dear one discover , The thought that I was not unworthy to love her . " There chiefly I sought thee , there only I found thee ; Her glance was the best of the rays that surround thee ; When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story , I knew it was love , and I felt it was glory . " His heart was wounded by the persecutions to which those he loved were subjected . His thoughts were for his daughter , who was growing up in the midst of her father 's enemies , and for his beloved sister who was praying for him . He contemplated in the future the time when he could show the moral and heroic power of his soul . He looked forward to the great deeds by which he was going to astonish them , and perhaps call for their admiration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him any thing but pain . " If I live , " he wrote to Moore , " you will see that I shall do something better than rhyming . " Truth however , when told by such men as Byron , and however ungraciously received , must guide in the end the steps of those who walk in its wake . This has been the case with Byron 's poetry . Its influence over the minds of Englishmen has been very salutary and great , and is one of the principal causes which brought on a reform of the rooted prejudices and opinions of the public in England , by the necessity under which it placed them of looking into the defects of the law and of the constitution , to which they had hitherto so crouchingly submitted . Since then the feeling of good-will toward other nations has materially increased in that great country . Others have improved the way which Byron opened up for reform , and thanks to him England at his death began to lose her excessive susceptibility . She became accustomed to listen to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to be exiled , or to suffer as Byron did up to the time of his death . His sufferings , no doubt , paved his way to everlasting glory , but his heroic death left him at the mercy of the enemies who survived him . If ever a premature death was unfortunate , Byron 's was ; not only for him , because he was on the point of giving to the world the proof of those virtues which had been denied him , but also for humanity , by the loss of various treasures which will probably never be found again . The epoch , however , of faint words and unbecoming silence has gone by even in England . Already one of the greatest men of England has claimed a monument in Westminster Abbey , which had been denied to his memory by the bigoted rancor of the man who was dean at the time of Byron 's death , denied to that poet whom another great English statesman has called " a great writer , but a still greater man . " There remains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been able to appreciate his great qualities . That duty is to proclaim them and to prevent the further spread of falsehood and error as to his real character . This is a very long letter , my dear count , but you know how long all letters must be which are intended to refute opinions and to rectify judgments . M. de Lamartine has the excellent habit of listening to your advice , and that is why I have had at heart to let you know the truth about Byron . The present work will adduce the proofs of the appreciations contained in this letter . I know that you do not require them , but also that the public does . Pray accept , etc.  --   --  . FOOTNOTES : Footnote 6 : Galt says , " It was in the course of the passage to the island of Zea , where he was put on shore , that one of the most emphatic incidents of his life occurred ; an incident which throws a remarkable gleam into the springs and intricacies of his character , more perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , as he was walking the quarter-deck , he lifted an attaghan ( it might be one of the midshipmen 's weapons ) , and unsheathing it , said , contemplating the blade , ' I should like to know how a person feels after committing murder . ' By those who have inquiringly noticed the extraordinary cast of his metaphysical associations , this dagger scene must be regarded as both impressive and solemn ; the wish to know how a man felt after committing murder does not imply any desire to perpetrate the crime . The feeling might be appreciated by experiencing any actual degree of guilt ; for it is not the deed ,  --  the sentiment which follows it makes the horror . But it is doing injustice to suppose the expression of such a wish dictated by desire . Lord Byron has been heard to express , in the eccentricity of conversation , wishes for a more intense knowledge of remorse than murder itself could give . There is , however , a wide and wild difference between the curiosity that prompts the wish to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direful passions that instigate to guilty gratifications. "  --  Galt , 152 . His curiosity was psychological and philosophical , that of a great artist wishing to explore the heart of man in its darkest depths . On the eve of his departure from Rome he assisted at the execution of three assassins , remaining to the end , although this spectacle threw him into a perfect fever , causing such thirst and trembling that he could hardly hold up his opera-glass . At Venice he preferred Madame Benzoni 's conversation to that of Madame Albrizzi , because she was more thoroughly Venetian , and as such more fitted for the study he wished to make of national manners . He used to say that every thing in the world ought to be seen once , and it is to this idea that we must specially attribute some of the oddities so exaggerated and so much criticised during his short stay at Venice , for in reality he had none of these tastes .

"  --  Parry , 180 . CHAPTER II . PORTRAIT OF LORD BYRON . The following letter was addressed to M. de Lamartine , who had asked the author of these pages to give him the " portrait physique " of Lord Byron . MY DEAR MONSIEUR DE LAMARTINE ,  --  Being on the point of departure , I nevertheless wish to send you a few explanations which must serve as my apology . You have asked me to draw the portrait of Lord Byron , and I have promised you that I would do so . I now see that my promise was presumptuous . Every time I have endeavored to trace it , I have had to put down my pen , discouraged as I was by the fact of my always discovering too many obstacles between my reminiscences and the possibility of expressing them . My attempts appeared to me at times to be a profanation by the smallness of their character ; at others , they bore the mark of an extreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak in its results and very ridiculous in its want of power . Images which are preserved in thought to a degree which may almost be considered supernatural , are susceptible of too much change during the short transit of the mind to the pen . The Almighty has created beings of such harmonious and ideal beauty that they defy description or analysis . Such a one was Lord Byron . His wonderful beauty of expression has never been rendered either by the brush of the painter or the sculptor 's chisel . It summed up in one magnificent type the highest expression of every possible kind of beauty . If his genius and his great heart could have chosen a human form by which they could have been well represented , they could not have chosen another ! Genius shone in his very looks . All the effects and emotions of a great soul were therein reflected as well as those of an eminently good and generous heart , and indeed contrasts were visible which are scarcely ever united in one and the same person . His eyes seized and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and transparency such as called forth from Sir Walter Scott the remark , that the fine head of his young rival " was like unto a beautiful alabaster vase lightened up by an interior lamp . " To see him , was to understand thoroughly how really false were the calumnies spread about as to his character . The mass , by their obstinacy in identifying him with the imaginary types of his poems , and in judging him by a few eccentricities of early youth , as well as by various bold thoughts and expressions , had represented to themselves a factitious Byron , totally at variance with the real man . Calumnies , which unfortunately he passed over in disdainful silence , have circulated as acknowledged facts . Time has destroyed many , but it would not be correct to say that they have all entirely been destroyed . Lord Byron was silent , because he depended upon time to silence his calumniators . All those who saw him must have experienced the charm which surrounded him as a kind of sympathetic atmosphere , gaining all hearts to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ? Tell them to look at the pictures of him which were painted by Saunders , by Phillips , by Holmes , or by Westall ? All these , although the works of great artists , are full of faults . Saunders 's picture represents him with thick lips , whereas his lips were harmoniously perfect : Holmes almost gives him a large instead of his well-proportioned and elegant head ! In Phillips 's picture the expression is one of haughtiness and affected dignity , never once visible to those who ever saw him. 7 " These portraits , " says Dallas , " will certainly present to the stranger and to posterity that which it is possible for the brush to reproduce so far as the features are concerned , but the charm of speech and the grace of movement must be left to the imagination of those who have had no opportunity to observe them . No brush can paint these . " The picture of Byron by Westall is superior to the others , but does not come up to the original . As for the copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and circulated , they are all exaggerated , and deserve the appellation of caricatures . Can his portrait be found in the descriptions given by his biographers ? But biographers seek far more to amuse and astonish , in order that their writings may be read , than to adhere to the simple truth . It can not be denied , however , that in the portraits which several , such as Moore , Dallas , Sir Walter Scott , Disraeli in London , the Countess Albrizzi at Venice , Beyle ( Stendhal ) at Milan , Lady Blessington and Mrs. Shelley in Italy , have drawn of Lord Byron there is much truth , accompanied by certain qualifications which it is well to explain . I shall therefore give in their own words ( preferring them to my own impressions ) the unanimous testimony of those who saw him , be they friends or beings for whom he was indifferent . Here are Moore 's words :  --  " Of his face , the beauty may be pronounced to have been of the highest order , as combining at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His eyes , though of a light gray , were capable of all extremes of expression , from the most joyous hilarity to the deepest sadness , from the very sunshine of benevolence to the most concentrated scorn or rage . But it was in the mouth and chin that the great beauty as well as expression of his fine countenance lay . " His head was remarkably small , so much so as to be rather out of proportion with his face . The forehead , though a little too narrow , was high , and appeared more so from his having his hair ( to preserve it , as he said ) shaved over the temples . Still the glossy dark-brown curls , clustering over his head , gave the finish to its beauty . When to this is added that his nose , though handsomely was rather thickly shaped , that his teeth were white and regular , and his complexion colorless , as good an idea perhaps as it is in the power of mere words to convey may be conceived of his features . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ informed us , five feet eight inches and a half , and to the length of his limbs he attributed his being such a good swimmer . His hands were very white , and , according to his own notions of the size of hands as indicating birth , aristocratically small . " " What I chiefly remember to have remarked , " adds Moore , " when I was first introduced to him , was the gentleness of his voice and manners , the nobleness of his air , his beauty , and his marked kindness to myself . Being in mourning for his mother , the color as well of his dress , as of his glossy , curling and picturesque hair , gave more effect to the pure , spiritual paleness of his features , in the expression of which , when he spoke , there was a perpetual play of lively thought , though melancholy was their habitual character when in repose . " When Moore saw him again at Venice , some eight years after the first impressions which Byron 's beauty had produced upon him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the character of that beauty . " He had grown fatter both in person and face , and the latter had most suffered by the change  --  having lost by the enlargement of the features some of that refined and spiritualized look that had in other times distinguished it .... He was still , however , eminently handsome , and in exchange for whatever his features might have lost of their high romantic character , they had become more fitted for the expression of that arch , waggish wisdom , that epicurean play of humor , which he had shown to be equally inherent in his various and prodigally gifted nature ; while by the somewhat increased roundness of the contours the resemblance of his finely-formed mouth and chin to those of the Belvedere Apollo had become still more striking . " 8 Here are now the words of Lady B  --   --  , who saw him a few weeks only before his last departure for Greece . This lady had conceived a totally different idea of Byron . According to her , Byron would have appeared affected , triste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his poems . But , if in order not to cause any jealousy among the living , she dared not reveal all her admiration , she at least suffered it to appear from time to time . " There are moments , " she says , " when Lord Byron 's face is shadowed over with the pale cast of thought , and then his head might serve as a model for a sculptor or a painter to represent the ideal of poesy . His head is particularly well formed : his forehead is high , and powerfully indicative of his intellect : his eyes are full of expression : his nose is beautiful in profile , though a little thickly shaped . His eyebrows are perfectly drawn , but his mouth is perfection . Many pictures have been painted of him , but the excessive beauty of his lips escaped every painter and sculptor . In their ceaseless play they represented every motion , whether pale with anger , curled in disdain , smiling in triumph , or dimpled with archness and love . " This portrait can not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she did not enjoy Lord Byron 's sympathy , and knew it ; she had also to forgive him various little circumstances which had wounded her " amour propre , " and was obliged to measure her praise in order not to create any jealousy with certain people who surrounded him and who had some pretension to beauty . Here is the portrait of him which another lady ( the Comtesse Albrizzi of Venice ) has drawn , notwithstanding her wounded pride at the refusal of Lord Byron to allow her to write a portrait of him and to continue her visits to him at Venice :  --  " What serenity on his forehead ! What beautiful auburn , silken , brilliant , and naturally curled hair ! What variety of expression in his sky-blue eyes ! His teeth were like pearls , his cheeks had the delicate tint of a pale rose ; his neck , which was always bare , was of the purest white . His hands were real works of art . His whole frame was faultless , and many found rather a particular grace of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person on entering a room . This bending of the body was , however , so slight that the cause of it was hardly ever inquired into . " As I have mentioned the deformity of his foot , even before quoting other testimonies to his beauty , I shall tarry a while and speak of this defect , the only one in so pre-eminently favored a being . What was this defect , since all becomes illustrious in an illustrious man ? Was it visible ? Was it true that Lord Byron felt this imperfection so keenly ? Here is the truth . No defect existed in the formation of his limbs ; his slight infirmity was nothing but the result of weakness of one of his ankles . His habit of ever being on horseback had brought on the emaciation of his legs , as evinced by the post-mortem examination ; besides which , the best proof of this has been lately given in an English newspaper much to the following effect :  --  " Mrs. Wildman ( the widow of the colonel who had bought Newstead ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had belonged to Lord Byron , and among others his boot and shoe trees . These trees are about nine inches long , narrow , and generally of a symmetrical form . They were accompanied by the following statement of Mr. Swift , bootmaker , who worked for his lordship from 1805 to 1807 . Swift is still alive , and continues to reside at Southwell . His testimony as to the genuineness of the trees , and to the nature of Lord Byron 's deformity , of which so many contradictory assertions have circulated , is as follows :  --  " ' William Swift , bootmaker at Southwell , Nottinghamshire , having had the honor of working for Lord Byron when residing at Southwell from 1805 to 1807 , asserts that these were the trees upon which his lordship 's boots and shoes were made , and that the last pair delivered was on the 10th of May , 1807 . He , moreover , affirms that his lordship had not a club foot , as has been said , but that both his feet were equally well formed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half shorter than the other . The defect was not in the foot but in the ankle , which , being weak , caused the foot to turn out too much . To remedy this his lordship wore a very light and thin boot , which was tightly laced just under the sole , and , when a boy he was made to wear a piece of iron with a joint at the ankle , which passed behind the leg and was tied behind the shoe . The calf of this leg was weaker than the other , and it was the left leg . ( Signed ) WILLIAM SWIFT . ' " This , then , is the extent of the defect of which so much has been said , and which has been called a deformity . As to its being visible , all those who knew him assert that it was so little evident that it was even impossible to discover in which of the legs or feet the fault existed . To the testimonies already quoted I must add another :  --  " His defect , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a way of walking which made it appear almost imperceptible , and indeed entirely so . I spent several days on board a ship with him without discovering this defect ; and , in truth , so little perceptible was it that a doubt always existed in my mind whether it might not be the effect of a temporary accident rather than a natural defect . " All those who knew him being therefore agreed in this opinion , that of people who were not acquainted with him is of no value . But if , in the material appreciation of a defect , they have not been able to err , several have erred in their moral appreciation of the fact by pretending that Lord Byron , for imaginary reasons , was exceedingly sensible of this defect . This excessive sensibility was a pure invention on the part of his biographers . When he did experience it ( which was never but to a very moderate extent ) , it was only because , physically speaking , he suffered from it . Under the sole of the weak foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long walks . " Once , at Genoa , " says Mme. G. , " he walked down the hill of Albaro to the seaside with me , by a rugged and rough path . When we had reached the shore he was very well and lively . But it was an exceedingly hot day , and the return home fatigued him greatly . When home I told him I thought he looked ill . ' Yes , ' said he , ' I suffer greatly from my foot ; it can hardly be conceived how much I suffer at times from that pain , ' and he continued to speak to me about this defect with great simplicity and indifference . " He used often even to laugh at it , so superior was he to that weakness . " Beware , " said Count Gamba to him on one occasion while riding with him , and on reaching some dangerous spot , " beware of falling and breaking your neck . " " I should decidedly not like it , " said Byron ; " but if this leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break , it would be the same to me , and perhaps then I should be able to procure myself a more useful one . " The sensitiveness , therefore , which he was said to experience , and which would have been childish in him , was in reality only the occasional experience of a physical pain which did not , however , affect his strength , nor the grace of his movements , in all those physical exercises to which he was so much attached . It in no wise altered his good looks , and , as a proof of this , I shall again bring testimonies , giving first that of M.N. , who was at Constantinople when Byron arrived there for the first time , and who thus describes him in a review which he wrote of him after Byron 's death :  --  " A stranger then entered the bazar . He wore a scarlet cloak , richly embroidered with gold in the style of an English aid-de-camp 's dress uniform . He was attended by a janissary attached to the English Embassy and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His features were of so exquisite a delicacy , that one might almost have given him a feminine appearance , but for the manly expression of his fine blue eyes . On entering the inner shop he took off his hat , and showed a head of curly auburn hair , which improved in no small degree the uncommon beauty of his face . The impression his whole appearance made upon my mind , was such that it has ever remained most deeply engraven on it ; and although fifteen years have since gone by , the lapse of time has not in the least impaired the freshness of the recollection . " Then , speaking of his manner , he goes on to say : " There was so irresistible an attraction in his manner , that only those who have been so fortunate as to be admitted to his intimacy can have felt its power . " Moore once asked Lady Holland whether she believed that Lady Byron had ever really loved Lord Byron . " Could it be otherwise ? " replied Lady Holland . " Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him there now , surrounded as it were by that great light : oh , how handsome he was ! " One of the most difficult things to define was the color of his eyes . It was a mixture of blue , gray , and violet , and these various colors were each uppermost according to the thought which occupied his mind or his heart . " Tell me , dear , " said the little Eliza to her sister , whose enthusiasm for Byron she shared , " tell me what is the color of his eyes ? " " I can not say ; I believe them to be dark , " answered Miss Eliza , " but all I know is that they have quite a supernatural splendor . " And one day , having looked at them with greater attention in order to ascertain their color , she said , " They are the finest eyes in the world , but not dark , as I had at first believed . Their hue is that of the eyes of Mary Stuart , and his long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I before , nor ever again shall I , see such eyes ! As for his hands , they are the most beautiful hands , for a man , I ever saw . His voice is a sweet melody . " 9 Sir Walter Scott was enchanted when he could dilate on the extraordinary beauty of Byron . One day , at Mr. Home Drummond 's , he exclaimed :  --  " As for poets , I have seen the best that this country has produced , and although Burns had the finest eyes that can be imagined , I never thought that any man except Byron could give an artist the exact idea of a poet . His portraits do not do him the least justice ; the varnish is there , but the ray of sunshine is wanting to light them up . The beauty of Byron , " he added " is one which makes one dream . " Colonel Wildman , his colleague at Harrow , and his friend , was always wont to say , " Lord Byron is the only man among all those I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a really handsome man . " Disraeli , in his novel entitled " Venetia , " speaks thus of the beauty of Hubert ( who is Lord Byron ) when Venetia finds his portrait :  --  " That being of supernatural beauty is her father . Young as he was , command and genius , the pride of noble passions , all the glory of a creative mind , seemed stamped upon his brow . With all his marvellous beauty he seemed a being born for greatness .... Its reality exceeded the wildest dreams of her romance , her brightest visions of grace and loveliness and genius seemed personified in this form . He was a man in the very spring of sunny youth and of radiant beauty . He was above the middle height , yet with a form that displayed exquisite grace .... It was a countenance of singular loveliness and power . The lips and the moulding of the chin resembled the eager and impassioned tenderness of the shape of Antinous ; but instead of the effeminate sullenness of the eye and the narrow smoothness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On each side of the clear and open brow descended , even to the shoulders , the clustering locks of golden hair ; while the eyes large and yet deep , beamed with a spiritual energy , and shone like two wells of crystalline water that reflect the all-beholding heavens . " M. Beyle ( Stendhal ) writes to Mr. Swanton Belloc :  --  " It was in the autumn of the year 1816 that I met Lord Byron at the theatre of the Scala , at Milan , in the box of the Bremen Minister . I was struck with Lord Byron 's eyes at the time when he was listening to a sestetto in Mayer 's opera of " Elena . " I never in my life saw any thing more beautiful or more expressive . Even now , when I think of the expression which a great painter should give to genius , I always have before me that magnificent head . I had a moment of enthusiasm . " And further , he adds that one day he saw him listening to Monti while the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I shall never forget , " said he , " the divine expression of his look ; it was the serene look of genius and power . " I might multiply these testimonies of people who have seen him , and fill many pages ; their particular character is their uniform resemblance . This proves the soundness of the ground on which their truth is based . I will add one more testimony to the others , that of Mrs. Shelley , which is even nearer the truth , and condenses all the others :  --  " Lord Byron , " said this distinguished woman , " was the first genius of his age and the handsomest of men . " In all these portraits there is much truth , but they are not sufficiently complete to give those who never saw him any but a faint idea of his smile , or of his mouth , which seemed to be not suited to material purposes , and to be purely intellectual and divine ; of his eyes , which changed from one color to another according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which was that of an infinite and intense softness ; of his sublime and noble brow ; of his melodious voice , which attracted and captivated ; and of that kind of supernatural light which seemed to surround him like a halo . This inability on the part of artists and biographers to render exactly Byron 's features and looks , is not to be wondered at , for although perfectly regular , his features derived their principal beauty from the life which his soul instilled into them . The emotions of his heart , the changes of his thoughts , appeared so variously upon his countenance , and gave the latter so changeable a cast , that it sufficed not for the artist who had to portray him , to gaze at and study him , as one generally does less gifted or elevated organizations . The reality was more likely to be well interpreted when it stood a prey to the various emotions of the soul ; in his leisure hours , in the full enjoyment of life and love , he was satisfied with the knowledge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it was that his beauty became , as it were , radiant and brilliant like a ray of sunshine . The time to see him was when , under the influence of genius , his soul was tormented with the desire of pouring out the numberless ideas and thoughts which flooded his mind : at such moments one scarcely dared approach him , awed , as it were , by the feeling of one 's own nothingness in comparison with his greatness . Again , the time to see him was when , coming down from the high regions to which a moment before he had soared , he became once more the simple child adorned with goodness and every grace ; taking an interest in all things , as if he were really a child . It was impossible then to refrain from the contemplation of this placid beauty , which , without taking away in the least from the admiration which it inspired , drew one toward him , and made him more accessible to one , and more familiar by lessening a little the distance which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should have been seen during the last days of his stay in Italy , when his soul had to sustain the most cruel blows ; when heroism got the better of his affections , of his worldly interests , and even of his love of ease and tranquillity ; when his health , already shaken , appeared to fail him each day more and more , to the loss of his intellectual powers . Had one seen him then as we saw him , it would scarcely have been possible to paint him as he looked . Does not genius require genius to be its interpreter ? Thorwaldsen alone has , in his marble bust of him , been able to blend the regular beauty of his features with the sublime expression of his countenance . Had the reader seen him , he would have exclaimed with Sir Walter Scott , " that no picture is like him . " Not only would he have observed in his handsome face the denial of all the absurd statements which had been made about him , but he would have noticed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the acts which he performed on this earth ; he would have read in unmistakable characters , not only what he was ,  --  a good man ,  --  but the promise of a moral and his life , and by the consequences of undeserved sorrow , it was well proved by his whole conduct toward the end of his life , and in the last poems which he wrote . His poems from year to year assumed a more perfect beauty , and increased constantly , not only in the splendor of their conception , but also in the force of their expressions , and their moral tendency , visible especially in his dramas . In them will be found types surpassing in purity , in delicacy , in grandeur , in heroism , without ever being untrue to nature , all that ever was conceived by the best poets of England . Shakspeare , in all his master creations , has not conceived a more noble soul than that of Angiolina , or a more tender one than Marina 's or even one more heroic than Myrrha 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more perfect . But the Almighty , who does not allow perfection to be of this world , did not permit him to remain on earth , when once he had reached that point . He allowed him , however ,  --  and this perhaps as a compensation for all the injuries which he had suffered ,  --  to die in the prime of life a death worthy of him ; the death of a virtuous man , of a hero , of a philosopher . Excuse this long letter , for if I have ventured to speak to you at such length of the moral , and  --  may I say the word ?  --  " physical " beauty of the illustrious Englishman , it is because one genius can appreciate another , and that , in speaking of so great a man as Lord Byron , there is no fear of tiring the listeners . FOOTNOTES : Footnote 7 : Among the bad portraits of Lord Byron spread over the world , there is one that surpasses all others in ugliness , which is often put up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for a good likeness ; it was done by an American , Mr. West ,  --  an excellent man , but a very bad painter . This portrait , which America requested to have taken , and which Lord Byron consented to sit for , was begun at Montenero , near Leghorn ; but Lord Byron , being obliged to leave Montenero suddenly , could only give Mr. West two or three sittings . It was then finished from memory , and far from being at all like Lord Byron , is a frightful caricature , which his family or friends ought to destroy . Footnote 8 : Moore . vol. ii . p. 248 . Footnote 9 : Miss E. Smith . CHAPTER III . FRENCH PORTRAIT . " I see that the greater part of the men of my time endeavor to blemish the glory of the generous and fine actions of olden days by giving to them some vile interpretation , or by finding some vain cause or occasion which produced them  --  very clever , indeed ! I shall use a similar license , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  --  MONTAIGNE , chap . " Glory . " The portrait of Lord Byron , in a moral point of view , is still to be drawn . Many causes have conspired to make the task difficult , and the portrait unlike . Physically speaking , on account of his matchless beauty  --  mentally , owing to his genius  --  and morally , owing to the rare qualities of his soul , Lord Byron was certainly a phenomenon . The world agrees in this opinion ; but is not yet agreed upon the nature and moral value of the phenomenon . But as all phenomena have , besides a primary and extraordinary cause , some secondary and accidental causes , which it is necessary to examine in order that they may be understood ; so , to explain Byron 's nature , we must not neglect to observe the causes which have contributed chiefly to the formation of his individuality . His biographers have rather considered the results than the causes . Even Moore , the best among them , if not , indeed , the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of Lord Byron and its operations were inexplicable , but does not give himself the trouble to understand them . Here are his own words :  --  " So various indeed , and contradictory were his attributes , both moral and intellectual , that he may be pronounced to have been not one , but many : nor would it be any great exaggeration of the truth to say , that out of the mere partition of the properties of his single mind , a plurality of characters , all different and all vigorous , might have been furnished . It was this multiform aspect exhibited by him that led the world , during his short , wondrous career , to compare him with the medley host of personages , almost all differing from each other , which he playfully enumerates in one of his journals . " The object of so many contradictory comparisons must probably be like something different from them all ; but what that is , is more than I know , or any body else . " But , while merely explaining the extraordinary richness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his changeable character , by the frankness which ever made his heart speak that which it felt , by his excessive sensitiveness , which made him the slave of momentary impressions , by his almost childlike delight and astonishment at things , Moore does not arrive at the true causes of the phenomenon . He registers , it is true , certain effects which become causes when they draw upon the head of Lord Byron certain false judgments , and open the door to every calumny . Without adopting the system of the influence of races on mankind  --  which , if pushed to its extreme consequences , must lead to the disastrous and deplorable doctrine of fatalism , and would make of man a mere machine  --  it is , however , impossible to deny that races and their amalgamation do exercise a great influence over our species . It is to this very influence of race , which was so evident in Lord Byron , that we attribute , in a measure , the exceptional nature of the great English poet . As the reader knows , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble race of the Birons of France . His ancestors accompanied William the Conqueror to England , aided him in the conquest of that country , and distinguished themselves in the various fields of battle which ultimately led to the total subjugation of the island . In his family , the sympathies of the original race always remained strong . His father , a youthful and brilliant officer , was never happy except in France . He was very intimate with the Marechal de Biron , who looked upon him as a connection . He even settled in Paris with his first wife , the Marchioness of Carmarthen . Soon after his second marriage , he brought his wife over to France , and it was in France that she conceived the future poet . When obliged to return to England to be confined , she was so far advanced in pregnancy that she could not reach London in time , but gave birth to Lord Byron at Dover . It was in France that Byron 's father died at thirty-five years of age . Through his mother  --  a Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had Scotch blood in his veins . The powerful influence exercised by the Norman Conquest , in the modification of all the old habits of Great Britain , and in making the English that which they now are , has descended as an heirloom to some old aristocratic families of the kingdom , where it discovers itself at different times in different individuals . Nowhere , perhaps , did this influence show itself more clearly than in the person of Lord Byron . His duplicate or triplicate origin was already visible in the cast of his features . Without any analogy to the type of beauty belonging to the men of his country ( a beauty seldom found apart from a kind of cold reserve ) , Lord Byron 's beauty appeared to unite the energy of the western with the splendor and the mildness of the southern climes . The influence of this mixture of races was equally visible in his moral and intellectual character . He belonged to the Gallic race ( modified by the Latin and Celtic elements ) by his vivacity and mobility of character , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ridiculous , by those smiles and sarcasms which hide or discover a profound philosophy , by his perception of humor without malice , by all those amiable qualities which in the daily intercourse of life made of him a being of such irresistible attraction . He belonged to that race likewise by his great sensitiveness , by his expansive good-nature , by his politeness , by his tractableness , by his universal character which rendered every species of success easy to him ; by his great generosity , by his love of glory , by his passion for honor , his intuitive perception of great deeds , by a courage which might have appeared rash , had it not been heroic , and which , in presence of the greatest perils and even of death , ever preserved for him that serenity of mind which allowed him to laugh , even at such times ; by his energy , and also by his numerous mental and bodily requirements ; and by his defects ,  --  which were , a slight tendency to indiscretion , a want of prudence injurious to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apparent fickleness . He belonged to the western race by his vast intellect , by his practical common sense , which formed the basis of his intellect , and which never allowed him to divorce sublime conceptions from sound sense and good reason ,  --  two qualities , in fact , which so governed his imagination as to make people say he had not any ; by the depth of his feelings , the extent of his learning , his passion for independence , his contempt of death , his thirst for the infinite , and by that kind of melancholy which seemed to follow him into the midst of every pleasure . All these various elements , which belonged separately to individuals in France , in England , and in various countries , being united in Lord Byron , produced a kind of anomaly which startled systematic critics , and even honest biographers . The apparent contradiction of all these qualities caused his critics to lose their psychological compass in their estimate of his charming nature , and justice , together with truth , suffered by the result . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remains to be painted . The most imaginary portrait , however , of Lord Byron , and certainly the least like him , is that which has general currency in France : not only has that portrait not been drawn from nature , not only is it a caricature , but it is also a calumny . Those who drew it took romance for history . They charged or exaggerated incidents in his life and peculiarities of his character ; thus the harmony of the tout ensemble was lost . Ugliness and eccentricity , which amuse , succeeded beauty and truth , which are sometimes wearisome . Those who knew and loved Lord Byron even more as a man than a genius ( and , after all , these are those who knew him personally ) suffer by this injustice done to him , and feel the absurdity of making so privileged a being act so whimsical a part , and one so contrary to his nature as well as to the reality of his life . If this imaginary portrait , however , were more like those which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory would become so difficult a task as to be almost impossible . Happily it is not so ; and those who would conscientiously consult Moore , Parry , and Gamba , must at least give up the idea that this admirable genius was the eccentric and unamiable being he has been represented . To reach this point would , perhaps , require a greater respect for truth . Even in France there are many superior persons who , struck by the force of facts , have at times endeavored to seize certain features which might lead to the discovery of truth , and have attempted to show that Lord Byron 's noble character and beauty of soul , as well as his genius , did honor to humanity . But their efforts have been vain in presence of the absurd and contradictory creation of fancy which has been styled " Lord Byron , " and which with few modifications , continues to be called so to this day . How has this occurred ? what gave rise to it ? ignorance , or carelessness ? Both causes in France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in cant ,  --  a species of scourge which is becoming quite the fashion . The first of these French biographers ( I mean of those who have written upon and wished to characterize Lord Byron ) , without knowing the man they were writing about , set to work with a ready-made Byron . This , no doubt , they found to be an easier method to follow , and one of which the results must prove at least original . But where had they found , and from whose hands did they receive this ready-made poet , whose features they reproduced and offered to the world ? Probably from a few lines , not without merit , of Lamartine , who by the aid of his rich imagination had identified Byron with the types which he had conceived for his Oriental poems , mixing up the whole with a heap of calumnies which had just been circulated about him . Perhaps also from certain critics who believed in the statements of various calumniators , and who themselves had probably not had any better authority than a few articles in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron . We all know , by what we see daily in France , how little we can trust the moderation of these , and the justice they render to their adversaries ; what must it not have been in England at that time , when passions ran so high ?  --  Perhaps also from the jealousy of dethroned rivals !  --  the echoes , perhaps , of the revenge of a woman equally distinguished by her rank and by her talent , but whose passion approached the boundaries of madness , or of the implacable hatred of a few fanatics who , substituting in the most shameless manner their worldly and sectarian interests for the Gospel , denounced him as an atheist because he himself had proclaimed them hypocrites . Finally , perhaps , from a host of absurd rumors , equally odious and vague , caused by his separation from his wife , and by the articles published in newspapers printed at Venice and at Milan . For Byron 's noble , simple , and sublime person was therefore substituted an imaginary being , formed out of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be believed , and by dint of sheer malice . Thus enveloped in a dense atmosphere , which became an obstacle to the disclosure of truth as the clouds are to the rays of the sun , his image only appeared in fantastical outlines borrowed from " Conrad the Corsair , " or " Childe Harold , " or " Lara , " or " Manfred , " or indeed " Don Juan . " Analogies were sought which do not exist , and to the poet were attributed the sentiments , and even the acts , of these imaginary beings , albeit without any of the great qualities which constituted his great and noble soul , and which he has not imparted to any of his poetical creations . Upon him were heaped every possible and most contradictory accusation  --  of skepticism and pantheism , of deism and atheism , of superstition and enthusiasm , of irony and passion , of sensuality and ideality , of generosity and avarice . These went to form his portrait , presenting every contrast and every antagonism , which God Himself , the Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all harmony , could not have assembled in one and the same being unless He made of him a species of new Frankenstein , incapable of treading the ordinary paths of physical , moral , or intellectual , nay , of the most ordinary existence . After thus producing such an eccentric character ,  --  the more extraordinary that they entirely forgot to consult the true and most simple history of his life , where if some of the ordinary excusable faults of youth are to be found , " some remarkable qualities , however , must be noticed , "  --  these wonderful biographers exclaim , astonished as it were at their own conclusions :  --  " This is indeed a most singular , extraordinary , and not-to-be-defined being ! " I should think so : it is their own work , not the noble , amiable , and sublime mind , the work of God , and which he always exhibited in himself , " Per far di colassa fede fra noi. "  --  PETRARCH . Happily , if to paint the portrait of Byron has become impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belviso , " it is easy to describe his moral character . His invisible form is , it is true , above , but a conscientious examination of his whole life will give us an idea of it . He knew this so well himself , that a few days before his death he begged , as a favor , of his friend Lord Harrington , then Colonel Stanhope , at Missolonghi , to judge him only by his deeds . " Judge me by my deeds . " All bombastic expressions , all systematic views should be discarded , and attention paid only to facts , in order to discover the fine intellectual figure of Lord Byron so completely lost sight of by his detractors . Since the imaginary creations of his pen in moments of exalted passion should not be taken as the real manifestation of his character , the latter is to be found in his own deeds , and in the testimony of those who knew him personally . Herein shall we seek truth by which we are to deal with the fanciful statements which have too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions of those who by their authority have a right to portray him , while we study the various causes which have contributed to lead the public into errors which time has nearly consecrated , but which shall be corrected in France , and indeed in every country where passion and animosity have no interest in maintaining them . " Public opinion , " says M. Cousin , " has its errors , but these can not be of long duration . " They lasted a long time , however , as regards Lord Byron ; but , thanks to God , they will not be eternal . He depended upon this himself , for he once at Ravenna wrote these prophetic words in a memorandum :  --  " Never mind the wicked , who have ever persecuted me with the help of Lady Byron : triumphant justice will be done to me when the hand which writes this is as cold as the hearts that have wounded me . " In England , Lord Byron triumphed over many jealous enemies whom his first satire earned for him , no less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , instead of appearing by degrees , burst forth at once , as it were , and towering over many established reputations . The prestige which he acquired was such that every obstacle was surmounted , and in one day he saw himself raised against his will , and without his having ever sought the honor , to the highest pinnacle of fashion and literary fame . In a country where success is all , his enemies , and those who were jealous of his name , were obliged to fall back ; but they did not give up their weapons nor their spite . One curious element was introduced in the national veneration for the poet . It was agreed that never had such an accumulation of various gifts been heaped upon the head of one man : he was to be revered and honored , but on one condition . He was to be a mysterious being whose genius should not transgress the boundaries of the East ; who was to allow himself to be identified with the imaginary beings of his own fancy , however disagreeable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True , his personal conduct ( at twenty-four ) was to be above all human weakness ; if not , he was to be treated , as certain superstitious votaries treat their idols if they do not obtain at once the miracles they ask for . His secret enemies perfidiously made use of these stupid demands of the public . Insinuating and giving out at times one calumny after another , they always kept behind the scenes , resolved , however , to ruin him in the public esteem on the first opportunity , which they knew they would not have long to wait for from one so open , so passionate , so generous as Lord Byron . The greatest misfortune of his life  --  his marriage  --  gave them their opportunity . Then they came forth , threw down the mask which they had hitherto worn , to put on one more hideous still ; overturned the statue from the pedestal upon which the public had raised it , and tried to mutilate its remains . But as the stuff of which it was made was a marble which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and outlawed it . Then it was that France made acquaintance with Lord Byron . She saw him first mysteriously enveloped in the romantic semblance of a Corsair , of a skeptical Harold , of a young lord who had despised and wounded his mother-country , from which he had almost been obliged to exile himself , in consequence of a series of eccentricities , faults , and  --  who knows ?  --  of crimes , perhaps . Thus caught in a perfidious net , Lord Byron left England for Switzerland . He found Shelley , whom he only knew by name , at Geneva , where he stopped . Shelley was another victim of English fanatical and intolerant opinions ; but he , it may be allowed at least , had given cause for this by some reprehensible writings , in which he had declared himself an atheist . No allowance had been made for his youth , for he was only seventeen when he wrote " Queen Mab , " and he found himself expelled not only from the university but also from his home , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Between these two great minds there existed a wide gulf  --  that which exists between pantheism and spiritualism ; but they had one great point of resemblance , their mutual passionate love for justice and humanity , their hatred of cant and hypocrisy , in fact , all the elevated sentiments of the moral and social man . With Lord Byron these noble dispositions of the heart and mind were naturally the consequence of his tastes and opinions , which were essentially spiritualistic . With Shelley , though in contradiction with his metaphysics , they were notwithstanding in harmony with the beautiful sentiments of his soul , which , when he was only twenty-three years of age , had already experienced the unkindness of man . Their respective souls , wounded and hurt by the perfidiousness and injustice of the world , felt themselves attracted to each other . A real friendship sprang up between them . They saw one another often , and it was in the conversations which they held together at this time that the seed was sown which shortly was to produce the works of genius which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alps and under the blue sky of Italy . Although Lord Byron 's heart was mortally wounded , still no feeling of hatred could find its way into it . The sorrow which he felt , the painful knowledge which he had of cruel and perfidious wrongs done to him , the pain of finding out the timidity of character of his friends , and the recollection of the many ungrateful people of whom he was the victim , all and each of these sentiments found their echo in the " Prisoner of Chillon , " in the third canto of " Childe Harold , " in " Manfred , " in the pathetic stanzas addressed to his sister , in the admirable and sublime monody on the death of Sheridan , and in the " Dream , " which according to Moore , he must have written while shedding many bitter tears . According to the same authority , the latter poem is the most melancholy and pathetic history that ever came forth from human pen . I shall not mention here the persecution to which Byron was subjected then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it drew forth from the noble poet in the midst of his retired , studious , regular , and virtuous existence . I shall speak of it elsewhere ; but I will say now that so unexampled , atrocious , and foolish was this persecution , that his enemies must have feared the awakening of the public conscience and the effects of a reaction , which might make them lose all the fruits of their victory , if they tarried in their efforts to prevent it . The most cruel among them was the poet laureate , in whose eyes Byron could have had but one defect  --  that of being superior to him . True , Byron had mentioned him in the famous satire which was the work of his youth ; but he had most generously expiated his crime by confessing it , in buying up the fifth edition so as to annihilate it , and by declaring that he would have willingly suppressed even the memory of it . This noble action had gained for him the forgiveness and even the friendship of the most generous among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Byron said , " of those who forgive . " This man arrived at Geneva , and at once set about his hateful work of revenge . This was all the easier on account of the spirit of cant which reigned in that country , and owing to the intimacy which he found to be existing between Byron and Shelley , for whom likewise he had conceived a malignant hatred . It must be said , however , that the laureate having to account for , among other works , his " Wat Tyler " ( which had been pronounced to be an immoral book , and had been prohibited on that account ) , rather trusted to his hypocrisy to regain for him the former credit he enjoyed . The intimacy between Byron and the spurned atheist Shelley presented a capital opportunity for this man to take his revenge . He circulated in Geneva all the false reports which had been current in London , and described Byron under the worst colors . Switzerland was at that time overrun by the English , whom the recently-signed Peace had attracted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who tried to make the good but bigoted people of Geneva believe in all the tittle-tattle against Byron which was passed about in London , and actually attempted to make a scandal of his very presence in their town . When he passed in the streets they stopped to stare at him insolently , putting up their glasses to their eyes . They followed him in his rides ; they reported that he was seducing all the girls in the " Rue Basse , " and , in fact , although his life was perfectly virtuous , one would have said that his presence was a contagion . Having found in a travellers ' register the name of Shelley , accompanied by the qualification of " atheist ! " which Byron had amiably struck out with his pen , the laureate caught at this and gave out that the two friends had declared themselves to be atheists . He attributed their friendship to infamous motives ; he spoke of incest and of other abominations , so odious , that Byron 's friends deemed it prudent not to speak to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only learned it at Venice later. 10 Loaded with this very creditable amount of falsehoods , most of which were believed in Geneva , the laureate returned to London to spread them in England , so as to prevent the effects of the beautiful and touching poems which were poured forth from the great and wounded soul of Byron , and which might have restored him to the esteem of all the honest and just minds of his country . Meanwhile Lady C. L  --   --  having failed to discover any one who would accept the reward she offered to the person who would take Byron 's life , had recourse to another means of injuring him  --  to a kind of moral assassination  --  which she effected by the publication of her revengeful sentiments in the three volumes entitled " Glenarvon . " Such a work might justify a biographer in passing it over with contempt without even mentioning it ; but as enemies of Lord Byron have made capital out of this book ,  --  as it found credence even with some superior minds , such as Goethe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensation all over England , and was a source of continual vexation and pain for Byron  --  it must not be passed over without comment , as Moore did to spare the susceptibility of living personages . Lady C. L  --   --  ( afterward Lady M  --   --  ) belonged to the high aristocracy of England . Young , clever , and fashionable , but a little eccentric , she had been married some years when she fell so desperately in love with Lord Byron that she braved every thing for him . It was not Byron who made the first advances , for his powers of seduction were only the attractions with which nature had endowed him . His person , his voice , his look ,  --  all in him was irresistible . In presenting himself anywhere , he could very well say with Shakspeare , in " Othello , "  --  " This only is the witchcraft I have used . " Lord Byron , who was then only twenty-three years of age , and not married , was flattered , and more than pleased , by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ' s beauty was not particularly attractive to him , and although her character was exactly opposite to the ideal which he had formed of what woman 's character should be , yet she contrived to interest him , to captivate him by the power of her love , and in a very short time to persuade him that he loved her . This sort of love could not last . It was destined to end in a catastrophe . Lady L  --   --  ' s jealousy was ridiculous . Dressed sometimes as a page , sometimes in another costume , she was wont to follow him by means of these disguises . She quarrelled and played the heroine , etc . Byron , who disliked quarrels of all kinds ( and perhaps even the lady herself ) , besides being intimate with all her family , was too much the sufferer by this conduct not to endeavor to bring her back to a sense of reason and of her duty . He was indulging in the hope that he had succeeded in these endeavors when , at a ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after vain efforts to attract Byron 's attention , went up to him and asked him whether she might waltz . Byron replied , half-absently , that he saw no reason why she should not ; upon which her pride and her passion became so excited that she seized hold of a knife , and feigned to commit suicide . The ball was at once at an end , and all London was soon filled with accounts of this incident . Lady L  --   --  had scarcely recovered from the slight wound she had inflicted on herself , when she wrote to a young peer , and made him all kinds of extravagant promises , if he would consent to call out Byron and kill him . This , however , did not prevent her calling again upon Lord Byron , not , however , says Medwin , with the intention of blowing his brains out ; as he was not at home , she wrote on one of his books " Remember me . " On returning home , Byron read what she had written , and , filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Remember thee ! Ay , doubt it not , " and sent her back several of her letters sealed up . " Glenarvon " was her revenge . She painted Byron in fiendish colors , giving herself all the qualities he possessed , so as to appear an angel , and to him all the passions of the " Giaour , " of the " Corsair , " and of " Childe Harold , " so that he might be taken for a demon . In this novel , the result of revenge , truth asserts its rights , notwithstanding all the contradictions of which the book is full . Thus Lady L  --   --  can not help depicting Byron under some of his real characteristics . She was asked , for instance , what she thought of him , when she met him for the first time after hearing of his great reputation , and she answers , while gazing at the soft loveliness of his smile ,  --  " What do I think ? I think that never did the hand of God imprint upon a human form so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she adds :  --  " Never did the Sculptor 's hand , in the sublimest product of his talent , imagine a form and a face so exquisite , so full of animation or so varied in expression . Can one see him without being moved ? Oh ! is there in the nature of woman the possibility of listening to him , without cherishing every word he utters ? and having listened to him once , is it possible for any human heart ever to forget those accents which awaken every sentiment and calm every fear ? " Again :  --  " Oh better far to have died than to see or listen to Glenarvon . When he smiled , his smile was like the light of heaven ; his voice was more soothing from its softness than the softest music . In his manner there was such a charm , that it would have been vain to affect even to be offended by its sweetness . " But while she was obliged to obey the voice of passion and of truth , she took on the other hand as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " which even applied to the " Corsair " is not altogether just , for he was gifted with more than " one virtue :  --  " " He left a Corsair 's name to other times , Link 'd with one virtue and a thousand crimes . " It is , however , fair to add , that this revenge became the punishment of the heroine ; she never again found any rest , struggled against a troubled mind , and never succeeded in forgetting her love . It is even said that , diseased in mind and body , she was one day walking along one of the alleys of her beautiful place , on the road to Newstead Abbey , when she saw a funeral procession coming up the road in the direction of Newstead . Having inquired whose funeral it was , and being told it was that of the great poet , whose mortal remains were being conveyed to their last resting-place , she fainted , and died a few days afterward . His name was the last word she uttered , and this she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever the authoress was known , the book had no success , but the case was different abroad and in the provinces . Attracted as he always was toward all that is good , great , and sincere , Byron was wont to break the monotony of his retired life in the villa Diodati by frequent visits to Madame de Stael at her country-seat , " Coppet . " She was the first who mentioned " Glenarvon " to him , and when Murray wrote to him on the subject , Byron simply replied ,  --  " Of Glenarvon , Madame de Stael told me ( ten days ago at Coppet ) marvellous and grievous things ; but I have seen nothing of it but the motto , which promises amiably ' for us and for our tragedy ' ... ' a name to all succeeding , ' etc . The generous moment selected for the publication is probably its kindest accompaniment , and , truth to say , the time was well chosen . " 11 " I have not even a guess at its contents , " said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But a few days later he had a proof of the bad effect which its appearance had produced , for all this venom against him had so poisoned the mind of a poor old woman of sixty-three , an authoress , that on Lord Byron entering Madame de Stael 's drawing-room one afternoon , she fainted , or feigned to do so . Poor soul ! a writer of novels herself , and probably most partial to such reading , she had , no doubt , from the perusal of " Glenarvon " gleaned the idea that she had before her eyes that hideous monster of seduction and perpetrator of crimes who was therein depicted ! At last Lord Byron read this too famous novel , and wrote to Moore as follows on the subject :  --  " Madame de Stael lent me ' Glenarvon ' last autumn . It seems to me that if the author had written the truth , and nothing but the truth , and the whole truth , the novel might not only have been more romantic but more amusing . As for the likeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit long enough for it . " From Venice Byron wrote as follows to Murray , in consequence of a series of articles which appeared in Germany , where a serious view had been taken of the novel of " Glenarvon : "  --  " An Italian translation of ' Glenarvon ' was lately printed at Venice . The censor ( Sgr . Petrolini ) refused to sanction the publication till he had seen me on the subject . I told him that I did not recognize the slightest relation between that book and myself ; but that , whatever opinions might be held on that subject , I would never prevent or oppose the publication of any book in any language , on my own private account , and desired him ( against his inclination ) to permit the poor translator to publish his labors . It is going forward in consequence . You may say this , with my compliments , to the author . " 12 Madame de Stael had a great affection for Lord Byron , but his detractors had found their way into her house. 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been injured by any speech or word of Lord Byron , but who , setting himself up as an amateur enemy of the poet , had , under an anonymous designation , been one of his bitterest detractors in the " Edinburgh Review , " on the occasion of the publication of his early poems . This same lawyer endeavored to gain Madame de Stael over to his opinion of Byron 's merit , probably on account of the very knowledge that he had of the harm he had done him ; hatred , like nobility , has its obligations . But Madame de Stael , who , on reading " Farewell , " was wont to say that she wished almost she had been as unfortunate as Lady Byron , was too elevated in mind and too noble in character to listen quietly to the abuse of Byron in which his enemies indulged . She , however , tried to induce Lord Byron to become reconciled to his wife , on the ground that one should never struggle against the current of public opinion . Madame de Stael actually succeeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but the lawyer before mentioned used every argument to prevent her pursuing this project of mediation . Lord Byron 's biographers have told how Lady Byron received this proposal ; which , after the way in which he had been treated , appears to have been , on the part of Byron , an act of almost superhuman generosity . Such an offer should have moved any being gifted with a heart and a soul . But I will not here speak of her refusal and of its consequences ; all I wish to state is , that the calumnies put forward against him being too absurd for Byron to condescend to notice , assumed a degree of consistency which deceived the public , and even made dupes of superior men , who in their turn contributed to make dupes of others . At this time , then , when the war and the continental blockade were at an end , when each and every one came pouring on to the Continent , did the star of Byron begin to shine on the European horizon ; but , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by dark and ominous clouds . Lamartine , who was then travelling in Switzerland , was able to find in this sad state of things materials for his fine poem " Meditation , " and for doubts whether Byron was " an angel , or a demon , " according to the manner in which he was viewed , be it as a poet or as a man ; and , as if all this were not enough , a host of bad writings were attributed to his pen , which brought forth the following expressions in a letter to Murray , his publisher :  --  " I had hoped that some other lie would have replaced and succeeded to the thousand and one falsehoods amassed during the winter . I can forgive all that is said of or against me , but not what I am made to say or sing under my own name . I have quite enough to answer for my own writings . It would be too much even for Job to bear what he has not said . I believe that the Arabian patriarch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did not go so far as to be willing to sign his name on the first page . " But the public mind was so disposed to look at Byron in the light of a demon , as traced by Lamartine , that when some young scattered-brain youth published out of vanity , or perhaps for speculative motives , another monstrous invention , in the hope of passing it off as a work of Byron , he actually succeeded for some time in his object without being discovered . " Strange destiny both of books and their authors ! " exclaims the writer of the " Essai sur Lord Byron , " published in 1823 ,  --  " an evidently apocryphal production , which was at once seen not to be genuine by all persons of taste , notwithstanding the forgery of the title , has contributed as much to make Byron known in France as have his best poems . A certain P  --   --  had impudence enough to attribute indirectly to the noble lord himself the absurd and disgusting tale of the ' Vampire , ' which Galignani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of Byron . Upon this Lord Byron hastened to remonstrate with Messieurs Galignani ; but unfortunately too late , and after the reputation of the book was already widespread . Our theatres appropriated the subject , and the story of Lord Ruthven swelled into two volumes which created some sensation . " 14 Goethe also believed the novels to be true stories , and was especially impressed with " Glenarvon. " 15 It is reported that he became jealous of Byron on the appearance of the poem of " Manfred . " If he were not , it is at least certain that the pagan patriarch never could sympathize with the new generation of Christian geniuses . On the 7th of June , however , of the year 1820 , Byron writes as follows to Murray , from Ravenna :  --  " Inclosed is something which will interest you , to wit , the opinion of the greatest man of Germany , perhaps of Europe , upon one of the great men of your advertisements ( all ' famous hands , ' as Jacob Tonson used to say of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's upon ' Manfred . ' There is the original , an English translation , and an Italian one ; keep them all in your archives , for the opinions of such a man as Goethe , whether favorable or not , are always interesting ; and this more so , as being favorable . His ' Faust ' I never read , for I do n't know German ; but Matthew Monk Lewis , in 1816 , at Geneva , translated most of it to me viva voce , and I was naturally much struck with it : but it was the ' Steinbach , ' and the ' Yungfrau , ' and something else , much more than ' Faustus , ' that made me write ' Manfred . ' The first scene , however , and that of ' Faustus ' are very similar . " One can scarcely conceive how so great a mind as that of Goethe could have been duped by such mystifications . And yet this is what he wrote at that time in a German paper relative to Byron 's " Manfred : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most astonishing talent borne to be its own tormentor . The character of Lord Byron 's life and poetry hardly permits a just and equitable appreciation . He has often enough confessed what it is that torments him . He has repeatedly portrayed it , and scarcely any one feels compassion for this intolerable suffering over which he is ever laboriously ruminating . There are , properly speaking , two females whose phantoms forever haunt him , and which , in this piece also , perform principal parts , one under the name of Astarte , the other without form or actual presence , and merely a voice . Of the horrid occurrence which took place with the former the following is related . When a bold and enterprising young man , he won the affections of a Florentine lady . Her husband discovered the amour , and murdered his wife ; but the murderer was the same night found dead in the street , and there was no one to whom any suspicion could be attached . Lord Byron removed from Florence , and these spirits haunted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered highly probable by innumerable allusions to it in his poems . " And Moore adds :  --  " The grave confidence with which the venerable critic traces the fancies of his brother poet to real persons and events , making no difficulty even of a double murder at Florence , to furnish grounds for his theory , affords an amusing instance of the disposition , so prevalent throughout Europe , to picture Byron as a man full of marvels and mysteries , as well in his life as his poetry . To these exaggerated or wholly false notions of him , the numerous fictions palmed upon the world , of his romantic tours and wonderful adventures in places he never saw , and with persons who never existed , have , no doubt , considerably contributed , and the consequence is , so utterly out of truth and nature are the representations of his life and character long current upon the Continent , that it may be questioned whether the real ' flesh and blood ' hero of these pages ( the social , practical-minded , and , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , to the over-exalted imaginations of most of his foreign admirers , appear only an ordinary , unromantic , and prosaic personage . " Then , quoting some of the falsehoods which were spread everywhere about Byron , Moore says :  --  " Of this kind are the accounts , filled with all sorts of circumstantial wonders , of his residence in the island of Mytilene ; his voyages to Sicily , to Ithaca , with the Countess Guiccioli , etc . But the most absurd , perhaps , of all these fabrications are the stories told by Pouqueville , of the poet 's religious conferences in the cell of Father Paul , at Athens ; and the still more unconscionable fiction in which Rizo has indulged , in giving the details of a pretended theatrical scene , got up ( according to this poetical historian ) between Lord Byron and the Archbishop of Arta , at the tomb of Botzaris , at Missolonghi . " As the numerous causes which led to the false judgment of Byron 's true character never ceased to exist during his lifetime , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been able to arrive at the truth of matters concerning him . The contrast which existed between the real and imaginary personage was such as to cause the greatest astonishment to all those who , having hitherto adopted the received notions about him , at last came to know him at Ravenna , at Pisa , at Genoa , and in Greece , up to the very last days of his life . But , before quoting some of these fortunate travellers , I must transcribe a few more passages from Moore : " On my rejoining him in town this spring , I found the enthusiasm about his writings and himself , which I had left so prevalent , both in the world of literature and society , grown , if any thing , still more genuine and intense . In the immediate circle perhaps around him , familiarity of intercourse must have begun to produce its usual disenchanting effect . " " His own liveliness and unreserve , on a more intimate acquaintance , would not be long in dispelling that charm of poetic sadness , which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romantic notions , connected by some of his fair readers with those past and nameless loves alluded to in his poems , ran some risk of abatement from too near an acquaintance with the supposed objects of his fancy and fondness at present . " " But , whatever of its first romantic impression the personal character of the poet may , from such causes , have lost in the circle he most frequented , this disappointment of the imagination was far more than compensated by the frank , social , and engaging qualities , both of disposition and manner , which , on a nearer intercourse , he disclosed , as well as by that entire absence of any literary assumption or pedantry , which entitled him fully to the praise bestowed by Sprat upon Cowley  --  that few could ever discover he was a great poet by his discourse . " While thus by his friends , he was seen in his true colors , in his weakness and in his strength , to strangers , and such as were out of this immediate circle , the sternness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , supposed to belong , not only as regarded mind , but manners , to himself . So prevalent and persevering has been this notion , that , in some disquisitions on his character published since his death , and containing otherwise many just and striking views , we find , in the portrait drawn of him , such features as the following :  --  " Lord Byron had a stern , direct , severe mind : a sarcastic , disdainful , gloomy temper . He had no sympathy with a flippant cheerfulness : upon the surface was sourness , discontent , displeasure , ill-will . Of this sort of double aspect which he presented , the aspect in which he was viewed by the world and by his friends , he was himself fully aware ; and it not only amused him , but indeed to a certain extent , flattered his pride . " " And if there was ever any tendency to derangement in his mental conformation , on this point alone could it be pronounced to have manifested itself . In the early part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this humor , I have known him more than once , as we have sat together after dinner , to fall seriously into this sort of dark and self-accusing mood , and throw out hints of his past life with an air of gloom and mystery designed evidently to awaken curiosity and interest .... It has sometimes occurred to me that the occult cause of his lady 's separation from him , round which herself and her legal adviser have thrown such formidable mystery , may have been nothing more , after all , than some imposture of this kind , intended only to mystify and surprise , while it was taken in sober seriousness . " I have mentioned elsewhere how Moore , while justly appreciating the consequences of this youthful eccentricity ,  --  of which later , but too late , Byron corrected himself ,  --  does not equally appreciate the motives , or rather the principal motive , which gave rise to it . As , however , he judges rightly of the results , I shall continue to quote him for the reader 's benefit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished with a short memoir of Lord Byron for the purpose of prefixing it to the French edition of his works , I had said jestingly , in a preceding letter to his lordship , that it would but be a fair satire on the disposition of the world to ' remonster his features ' if he would write for the public , English as well as French , a sort of mock heroic account of himself , outdoing in horrors and wonders all that had been yet related or believed of him , and leaving even Goethe 's story of the double murder at Florence far behind . " Lord Byron replied from Pisa , on the 12th of December , 1821 :  --  " What you say about Galignani 's two biographies is very amusing ; and , if I were not lazy , I would certainly do what you desire . But I doubt my present stock of facetiousness  --  that is , of good serious humor  --  so as not to let the cat out of the bag . I wish you would undertake it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beforehand , for any thing ludicrous that might keep those fools in their own dear belief that a man is a loup-garou . " I suppose I told you that the ' Giaour ' story had actually some foundation in fact .... I should not like marvels to rest upon any account of my own , and shall say nothing about it .... The worst of any real adventures is that they involve living people . " He at last tired of always appearing in the guise of a corsair , or of a mysterious criminal , or of a hero of melodrama . These various disguises had afforded him too much pain , and one day he said to Mr. Medwin :  --  " When Galignani thought of publishing a fresh edition of my works he wrote to Moore to ask him to give him some anecdotes respecting me : and we thought of composing a narrative filled with the most impossible and incredible adventures , to amuse the Parisians . But I reflected that there were already too many ready-made stories about me , to puzzle my brain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The reader will laugh when he hears that one of my friends assured me that the lines of Thyrza , published with the first canto to ' Childe Harold , ' were addressed by Byron to his bear ! There is nothing too wicked to be invented by hatred , or believed by ignorance . " Moore often refers to the wonderful contrast which existed between the real and imaginary Byron . Thus , in speaking of his incredibly active and sublime genius at Venice , he says :  --  " While thus at this period , more remarkably than at any other during his life , the unparalleled versatility of his genius was unfolding itself , those quick , chameleon-like changes of which his character , too , was capable , were , during the same time , most vividly and in strongest contrast , drawn out . To the world , and more especially to England ,  --  the scene at once of his glories and his wrongs ,  --  he presented himself in no other aspect than that of a stern , haughty misanthrope , self-banished from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Englishmen .... " How totally all this differed from the Byron of the social hour , they who lived in familiar intercourse with him may be safely left to tell . The reputation which he had acquired for himself abroad , prevented numbers , of course , of his countrymen , whom he would most cordially have welcomed , from seeking his acquaintance . But as it was , no " English gentleman ever approached him , with the common forms of introduction , that did not come away at once surprised and charmed by the kind courtesy and facility of his manners , the unpretending play of his conversation , and , on a nearer intercourse , the frank youthful spirits , to the flow of which he gave way with such a zest as even to deceive some of those who best knew him into the impression that gayety was , after all , the true bent of his disposition . " I must confine myself to these quotations , as it is not in my power to reproduce all that Moore has said on the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  First , that Lord Byron , instead of being a dark and gloomy hero of romance , was a man full of amiability , goodness , grace , sociability , and liveliness . Of the impression produced upon all those who knew him in these combined qualities , I shall have occasion to speak hereafter . Secondly , that since even after Byron 's death the fantastical notions about him were entertained even by so impartial and so enlightened a person as Sir Edward Brydges , it is not surprising ( nor should they be blamed for it ) that Frenchmen , and all foreigners in general , and even a great portion of Englishmen , should have believed in this fallacy . There was no means at that time of clearing up the mystery , nor can one see in this belief , however exaggerated , especially in France and on the Continent , any spirit either of direct hostility , or even ill-will toward him . The error was exported from England , and upon it they reasoned , logically and oftentimes wittily . But surely those can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the true state of things had been disclosed at the poet 's death in the writings of such biographers as Moore , Parry , Medwin himself , Count Gamba , and others who knew Byron personally . That a portion of the British public should maintain certain prejudices , and preserve a certain animosity against Byron , is not matter of astonishment to those who have at all studied the English character . The spirit of tolerance which exists in the laws , is far from pervading the habits of the people ; cant is on the decrease , but not quite gone , and may still lead one to a very fair social position . There still live a host of enemies whom Byron had made during his lifetime , and the number of whom ( owing to a bona fide treachery , by the indiscreet publication of a correspondence which was destined to be kept secret and in the dark ) , increased greatly after his death from the number of people whose pride he had therein wounded . He may be liable to the punishment due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtue , as intimated in the condemnation of the imaginary immorality of some of his works . He may be accused , with some truth , of having been too severe toward several persons and things . But not one of these reasons has any locus standi in France ,  --  a country which might claim a certain share in the honor of having been his mother-country . Besides having a French turn of mind in many respects , Byron , descended directly from a French stock , had been conceived in France , and had long lived in its neighborhood . If those , therefore , may be absolved who falsely appreciated Byron 's character both before and immediately after his death , the same indulgence can not be extended to those who persist in their unjust conclusions . Such men were greatly to blame ; for , in writing about Byron , they were bound in conscience to consult the biographers who had known him , and having neglected to do so , either from idleness or from party spirit , they failed in their duty as just and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add to these pages , which were written many years ago , a few remarks suggested by the perusal of a recent work which has caused great sensation by the talent which pervades it , by its boldness , and original writing . I allude to the work of M. Taine upon English literature ; therein he appreciates , in a manly , fine style , all the loftiness of Lord Byron 's poetry , but always under the influence of a received , and not self-formed , opinion . He likewise deserves , by his appreciations and conclusions , the reproaches addressed to the other critics of the illustrious and calumniated poet . In this work , which is rather magnificent than solid , and which contains a whole psychological system , one note is ever uppermost ,  --  that of disdain . Contempt , however , is not his object , but only his means . All must be sacrificed to the triumph of his opinions . The glory of nations , great souls , great minds , their works , their deeds , all must serve to complement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Corneille , Byron , all have erred . If he despises them , if he blames them , it is only to show that they have not been able to discover the logical conclusions which M. Taine at last reveals to us ,  --  conclusions which are to transform and change the soul as well as the understanding . This doctrine has hitherto been but a dream , and society has , up to the present time , walked in darkness . This philosophical system is so beautifully set forth , that it can only be compared to a skeleton , upon which a profusion of lovely-scented flowers and precious jewels have been heaped , so that , notwithstanding the horror it inspires , one is unable to leave it . Here , then , we find that M. Taine comes forth resolutely , by the help of a vigorous understanding and a surpassing talent , to review all that England has produced in a literary sense ,  --  authors as well as their works . The type which he has conceived alone escapes his censure . This type must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , centre and time . History must prove its correctness . History and logic might in vain claim his indulgence on behalf of other types . He has conceived his system in his own mind , and , to establish it , facts and characters are made subservient to it ; history 's duty is to prove their correctness . Indulgence can be shown to one type only . All he says is , however , so well said , that if he offended truth a little less , if he only spoke for beings in another planet , and above all , if , under these beautiful surroundings , one failed to notice the gloom of a heaven without God , the work would enchant one . It must be allowed that the charms of truth are still to be preferred ; we must therefore be allowed to say a few words about M. Taine 's system . It can only be in one sense ; not on account of any philosophical pretension , nor in the hope of restoring nature to its rights , however much we may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nay , a vegetable , and alas ! may be , a mineral system . Many able pens will repeat the admirable words of one of the cleverest men of the day , who , in his criticism upon M. Taine 's book , has so thoroughly examined how far a physiological method could be applied to the comprehension of moral and intellectual phenomena , and has shown to what fatal consequences such a method must lead . The analysis of the moral world , the study of souls and of talent , of doctrines and of characters , become in M. Taine 's mind only a branch of zoology , and psychology ends by being only a part of natural history . Many other able writers will echo the noble words of M. Caro , and will not fail to point out the numerous contradictions which exist between the work itself and history proper , between it and natural history , and , finally , between it and the author himself . Thus , men who have never allowed that a thistle could produce a rose , will question also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such glowing colors ,  --  " So active , " says he , " just like harriers on the beat flaring the air in the midst of the hunt , " can be transformed in a few years " into beings resembling animals good for slaughter , with appearances equally anxious , vacant , and stupid ; gentlemen six feet high , with long and stout German bodies , issuing from their forests with savage-looking whiskers and rolling eyes of pale earthenware-blue color . " Such critics will question whether the " pale earthenware-blue eyes " of these ugly sires can possibly be those of the fathers of the candid-eyed girls , the fairest among the fair treasures of this earth , whom M. Taine describes in such exquisite terms :  --  " Delightful creatures , whose freshness and innocence can not be conceived by those who have never seen them ! full-blown flowers , of which a morning rose , with its delicious and delicate color , with its petals dipped in dew , can alone give an idea . " Critics will deny the possibility of the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation does it seem to be . Such airy-like forms can not be produced by such heavy brutes as he describes . Say what he likes , nature can not act in the manner indicated by M. Taine . Nature must ever follow the same track . We , however , shall confine ourselves to oppose the real Lord Byron to the fanciful one of M. Taine ; and we say that the portrait of the poet drawn by the latter is drawn systematically , in such a manner as to contribute to the general harmony of his work . But truth can not be subservient to systems . As M. Taine views Lord Byron from a false starting point , it follows that , of course , the whole portrait of him is equally unreal . All the colors in his picture are too dark . What he says of the poet is not so false as it is exaggerated . This is a method peculiar to him . He decidedly perceives the real person , but exaggerates him , and thus fails to realize the original . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the consequences suggested to him by them , are always eminently so . When the facts seem ever so little to lend themselves to his reasoning , when the proportions of his victim allow of their being placed in the bed of Procrustes , the magnificent draperies of which do not hide the atrocious torture ; then , indeed , does M. Taine respect history more or less ; when this is not the case , his imagination supplies the deficiency . On this principle he gives us his details of Lord Byron 's parents and of the poet 's childhood . He makes use of Lord Byron as an artist makes use of a machine : he places him in the position which he has chosen himself , gives him the gesture he pleases , and the expression he wishes . The portrait he shows us of him may be a little like Lord Byron ; but a very distant likeness , one surrounded by a world of caprice of fancy and eccentricity which serve to make up a powerful picture . It is the effect of a well-posed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the disposal of M. Taine 's system . The features may be slightly those of Lord Byron , but the gestures and the general physiognomy are the clever creations of the artist . This is how he proceeds , in order to obtain the triumph of his views :  --  He selects some quarter of an hour from the life of a man , probably that during which he obeyed the impulses of nature , and judges his whole existence and character by this short space of time . He takes from the author 's career one page , perhaps that which he may have written in a moment of hallucination or of extreme passion ; and by this single page he judges the author of ten volumes . Take Lord Byron , for instance . With regard to his infancy , M. Taine takes care to set aside all that he knows to be admirable in the boy , and only notices one instance of energy , one fit of heroic passion , into which the unjust reprimand of a maid had driven him . The touching tears which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his playmates , he is informed that he has been raised to the dignity of a peer of the realm , are no sign to M. Taine of a character equally timid , sensitive , and good , but the result of pride . In this trait alone , M. Taine sees almost sufficient ground to lay thereon the foundations of his work , and to show us in the boy what the man was to be . A similar process is used in the examination of Byron as an author . He analyzes " Manfred , " which is most decidedly a work of prodigious power , and all he says of it is certainly both true and worthy of his own great talent ; but is it fair to say that the poet and the man are entirely revealed in this work , and to dismiss all the other creations of the poet , wherein milder qualities , such as feeling , tenderness , and goodness are revealed , and shine forth most prominently ? " Manfred " is the cry of an ulcerated heart , still struggling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the brutal decrees of a recent persecution . Lord Byron felt himself to be the victim of the relentless conduct of Lady Byron , and if his mind was not deranged , at least his soul was wounded and ill at ease , and it was this spirit that dictated " Manfred . " Did he not clearly confess it himself ? When he sent " Manfred " to Murray , did he not say that it was a drama as mad as the tragedy of " Lee Bedlam , " in twenty-five acts , and a few comic scenes  --  his own being only in three acts ? Did he not write to Moore as follows ?  --  " I wrote a sort of mad drama for the sake of introducing the Alpine scenery . Almost all the dramatis personae are spirits , ghosts , or magicians ; and the scene is in the Alps and the other world , so you may suppose what a Bedlam tragedy it must be .... The third act , like the Archbishop of Grenada 's homily ( which savored of the palsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was written . It must on no account be published in its present state .... The speech of Manfred to the sun is the only part of this act I thought good myself ; the rest is certainly as bad as bad can be , and I wonder what the devil possessed me . " But let Byron 's ideas take a different turn , as the lovely blue Italian sky and the refreshing breezes from the Adriatic waters contribute to quicken his blood , and other tones will be heard , wherein no longer shall the excesses , but the beauties only of energy be discernible . What does M. Taine say then ? This new aspect does not , evidently , satisfy him ! but what of that ? He goes on to say that Byron 's genius is falling off . If the poet takes advantage of a few moments of melancholy common to all poetical and feeling souls , M. Taine declares that the melancholy English nature is always associated with the epicurean . What is it to him , that England thinks differently ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceptions are the poems which he wrote in Italy , and even on the eve of his death ? and that she finds his liveliness " too real and too ultramontane to suit her national tastes ? " Nothing of this troubles M. Taine . Is it quite fair to judge so powerful a mind , so great and yet so simple a being as Lord Byron , only by his " Manfred , " or by some other passages of his works , and especially of " Don Juan ? " Can his amiable , docile , tender , and feeling nature honestly be seen in the child of three years of age , who tears his clothes because his nurse has punished him unfairly ? No ; all that we see is what M. Taine wishes us to see for the purpose he has in view , that is , admiration of the Lord Byron he has conceived , and who is necessary to his cause ,  --  a Byron only to be likened to a furious storm . Wishing Byron to appear as the type of energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Satan defying all powers on earth and in heaven . The better to mould him to the form he has chosen , he begins by disfiguring him in the arms of his mother , whom with his father and his family he scruples not to calumniate . Storms having their origin in the rupture of the elements , and a violent character being , according to M. Taine , the result of several forces acting internally and mechanically ; it follows that its primary cause is to be found in the disturbed moral condition of those who have given birth to him in the circumstances under which the child was born , and in the influence under which he has been brought up . Hence the necessity of supplementing from imagination the historical and logical facts which otherwise might be at fault . As for Lord Byron 's softness of manner , and as to that tenderness of character which was the bane of his existence ,  --  as to his real and great goodness , which made him loved always and everywhere , and which caused such bitter tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  these qualities are not to be sought in the strange , fanciful being who is styled Byron by M. Taine . These qualities would be out of place ; they would be opposed to the idea upon which his entire system is founded . They must be merged in the energy and greatness of intellect of the poetical giant . Unfortunately for M. Taine , facts speak too forcibly and too inopportunely against him . Not one of the causes which he mentions , not one of the conclusions which he draws in respect to Lord Byron 's character as a poet , and as a mere mortal , are to be relied upon . He , who contends that he possesses pre-eminently the power of comprehending the man and the author , insists that Lord Byron was no exception to the rule , though his best biographer , Moore , most distinctly opposes this opinion :  --  " In Lord Byron , however , this sort of pivot of character was almost wholly wanting .... So various indeed , and contradictory , were his attributes , both moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one , but many ; nor would it be any great exaggeration of the truth to say that out of the mere partition of the properties of his single mind a plurality of characters , all different and all vigorous , might have been furnished . " On the other hand , M. Taine , who generally pays little attention to the opinion of others , gives as Lord Byron 's predominant characteristic that which phrenologists denominate " combativite . " Which of the two is likely to be right ? If Moore is right , Lord Byron must have been almost wanting in consistency of character ; if Taine is correct , then Byron was really of a most passionate nature . But as we have proved that Lord Byron was not inconsistent , as Moore declares , except in cases where this want of consistency did not interfere with his character as a man , and , on the other hand , that no one had a less combative disposition , we are forced to arrive at the conclusion that if Byron had one dominant passion , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is impossible to deny that if in his early youth signs of resistance may have appeared in his character , yet these had so completely disappeared with the development of his intellect and of his moral sentiments that no one more than himself hated controversies and discussions of all kinds . In fact , no one was more obedient to the call of reason and of friendship ; and his whole life is an illustration of it . In order that Lord Byron should represent the English type , even if we adopt M. Taine 's philosophy , he should have had a deal of Saxon blood in his veins . But this was not the case . It is the Norman blood which predominates . He may be said to have been almost borne in France , and to be of French extraction by his father , and of Scotch origin through his mother . The total absence of the Saxon element , which was so remarkable in him , was equally noticeable in his tastes , mind , sympathies , and inclinations . He loved France very dearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pasha had got over the fright caused by the announcement that a young traveller , named Byron ( his name had been pronounced Bairon , which made the Pasha believe he was a Turk in disguise ) , wished to see him , he received the young lord very cordially . As he had just conquered Preveza from the French , Ali Pasha thought he should be pleasing the Englishman by announcing the fact to him . Byron replied  --  " But I am no enemy of France . Quite the contrary , I love France . " It might almost be said that he was quite the opposite of what a Saxon should be . Lord Byron could not remain , and , actually , lived a very short time , in England . His habits were not English , nor his mode of living . Far from over-eating , as the English , according to M. Taine , are said to do , Byron did not eat enough . He was as sober as a monk . His favorite food was vegetables . His abstinence from meat dated from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ material wants of his country . This remarkable sobriety was the effect of taste and principle , and was in no ways broken by excesses which might have acted as compensations . The excesses of which M. Taine speaks must have been at the utmost some slight deviations from the real Pythagorean abstinence which he had laid down as the rule of his life . Abroad , where he lived almost all his life , he had none of the habits of his countrymen . He lived everywhere as a cosmopolitan . All that his body craved for was cleanliness , and this only served to improve his health and the marvellous beauty with which God had gifted him . Lord Byron was so little partial to the characteristic features and customs of the country in which he was born  --  " but where he would not die "  --  that the then so susceptible amour-propre of his countrymen reproached him with it as a most unpardonable fault . It was not he who would have placed England and the English above all foreigners , and Frenchmen in particular ; nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the princes of the human race . Justice and truth forbade his committing himself to such statements in the name of national pride . Are the animal rather than moral , and moral rather than intellectual instincts of energy and will , which M. Taine so much admires in the Saxon race , defects or qualities in his eyes ? It is difficult to say , for one never knows when he is praising or when he is condemning . Judging by the very material causes from which he derives this energy ,  --  namely , the constitution of the people , their climate , their frequent craving for food , their way of cooking the food they eat , their drinks , and all the consequences of these necessities visible in the absence of all sense of delicacy , of all appreciation of the fine arts , and the comprehension of philosophy ,  --  he must evidently intend to depreciate them . But as regards Lord Byron in particular , it is equally certain that he has no intention of depreciating him . For him alone he finds expressions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent the whole nation , and to be the incarnation of the English character ; but on one condition ,  --  that of ruling it as its sovereign . Thanks to this supremacy , the poet escapes more or less the exigencies of M. Taine 's theories . M. Taine , however , is not subject to the weakness of enthusiasm . Judging , as he does , in the light of a lover of nature , both of the merits of virtue and of the demerits of vice , which to him are but fatal results of the constitution , the climate , and the soil  --  " in a like manner will sugar and vitriol "  --  why care about Lord Byron doing this or the other rightly or wrongly rather than any one else ? Nature follows its necessary track , seeks its equilibrium , and ends by finding it . What pleases him in Lord Byron , is the facility which is offered to him of proving the truth of this fatalist philosophy which appears at every page of his book . No one more than Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it were , the basis of his philosophical operations . His powerful genius , his short but eventful existence , which did not give time for the cooling down of the ardor of youth , to harmonize it with the tempered dictates of mature age ,  --  the universality of his mind , which can furnish arguments to every species of critics ,  --  all contributed wonderfully to the realization of M. Taine 's object . Thus , thanks to the deceptive but generally received portrait which is said to be that of Lord Byron , and to his identification with the heroes of his poems , and in particular with " Manfred " and " Childe Harold , " aided by the impossibility which the human mind finds in estimating moral subjects as it would a proposition of " Euclid , " M. Taine has been able to make use of a great name , and to make a fine demonstration of his system , to call Byron the interpreter of the British genius , and his poetry the expression of the man himself . In many respects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this way without violating historical facts . This is what I hope to point out in these pages , the object of which is to describe Byron as he was , and to substitute , without any derogation to his sublimity of character , the reality for the fiction created by M. Taine . To refute so brilliant and so powerful a writer , my only means is to proceed in this work with the help of positive proofs of the statements which I make , and by invoking unimpeachable testimonies . These alone constitute weighty arguments , since they all contribute to produce the same impression . In order that truth may be restored to history , I shall adopt a system diametrically opposed to that of M. Taine , or rather I shall abstain from all systems , and from all pretensions to literary merit , and confine myself entirely to facts and to reason . The reader will judge whether I shall be able to accomplish this object ; he will see how really unimportant are the causes which cast a shade upon the memory of Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credit too implicitly to the sincerity of that hypocritical praise which several of his biographers have bestowed upon him . They have , as it were , generally , taken a kind of pleasure in dwelling upon his age , his rank , and other extenuating circumstances , as a cover to their censure , just as if Byron ever required their forgiveness . In thus searching into the secrets of his heart , and analyzing his life , the reader will soon be obliged to admit , that if Byron , in common with others , had a few of the faults of youth , he in return had a host of virtues which belonged only to him . In short , if Byron is received in the light in which he was esteemed by those who knew him personally , he will still constitute one of the finest , most amiable , and grandest characters of his century . As for ourselves , in summing up the merits of this very humble , but very conscientious work , we can only repeat with delight the beautiful words in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth : " Should the effect of my humble labors be to clear away some of those mists that hung round my friend , and show him , in most respects , as worthy of love as he was , in all , of admiration , then will the chief and sole aim of this work have been accomplished . " 16 FOOTNOTES : Footnote 10 : When political events obliged Count Gamba to quit Romagna , he thought at first of going with his family to take up his abode at Geneva . Lord Byron , on learning this , through a letter from the Countess Guiccioli , who had rejoined her family at Florence , disapproved of their design , and begged Shelley  --  then on a visit to him at Ravenna  --  to express for him his disapprobation , and state the reasons of it . Shelley addressed the following letter in Italian to the countess , and the project was abandoned :  --  " MADAM ,  --  At the request of my friend , Lord Byron , I consider it my duty to offer you some considerations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give you an idea of the undesirable results likely to follow . I flatter myself that you will accept this request of his , together with the motives leading me to acquiesce , as an excuse for the liberty taken by a total stranger . In acting thus , the sole object I have in view is my friend 's peace of mind , and that of those in whom he is so deeply interested . I have no other motive , nor can entertain any other ; and let it suffice , in proof of my perfect sincerity , to assure you that I also have suffered from an intolerant clergy at home , and from tyranny , and that I like your family , have met with persecution and calumny as my sole reward for love of country . " Allow me , madam , to state the reasons for which it seems to me that Geneva would not be an appropriate residence for your family . Your circumstances offer some analogy with those existing between my family and Lord Byron in the summer of 1816 . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet and retired ; it would be impossible to imagine an existence simpler than ours , less calculated to draw down the aspersions cast upon us . " These calumnies were of the most unheard-of nature ,  --  really too infamous to permit us to treat them with disdain . Both Genevans and English established at Geneva affirmed that we were leading a life of the most unblushing profligacy . They said that we had made a compact together for outraging all held most sacred in human society . Pardon me , madam , if I spare you the details . I will only say that incest , atheism , and many other things equally ridiculous or horrible , were imputed to us . The English newspapers were not slow in propagating the scandal , and the nation lent entire faith . " Hardly any mode of annoying us was neglected . Persons living on the borders of the lake opposite Lord Byron 's house made use of telescopes to spy out all his movements . An English lady fainted , or pretended to faint , with horror on seeing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his friends were circulated ; and all this took place in the short period of three months . " The effect of this , on Lord Byron 's mind , was most unhappy . His natural gayety abandoned him almost entirely . A man must be more or less than a stoic to bear such injuries with patience . " Do not flatter yourself , madam , with the idea , that because Englishmen acknowledge Lord Byron as the greatest poet of the day , they would therefore abstain from annoying him , and , as far as it depended on them , from persecuting him . Their admiration for his works is unwillingly extorted , and the pleasure they experience in reading them does not allay prejudice nor stop calumny . " As to the Genevans , they would not disturb him , if there were not a colony of English established in the town ,  --  persons who have carried with them a host of mean prejudices and hatred against all those who excel or avoid them ; and as these causes would continue to exist , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about as numerous at Geneva as the natives , and their riches cause them to be sought after ; for the Genevans , compared to their guests , are like valets , or , at best , like hotel-keepers , having let their whole town to foreigners . " A circumstance , personally known to me , may afford proof of what is to be expected at Geneva . The only inhabitant on whose attachment and honor Lord Byron thought he had every reason to count , turned out one of those who invented the most infamous calumnies . A friend of mine , deceived by him , involuntarily unveiled all his wickedness to me , and I was therefore obliged to inform my friend of the hypocrisy and perversity we had discovered in this individual . You can not , madam , conceive the excessive violence with which Englishmen , of a certain class , detest those whose conduct and opinions are not exactly framed on the model of their own . This system of ideas forms a superstition unceasingly demanding victims , and unceasingly finding them . But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields in intensity to social hatred . This system is quite the order of the day at Geneva ; and , having once been brought into play for the disquiet of Lord Byron and his friends , I much fear that the same causes would soon produce the same effects , if the intended journey took place . Accustomed as you are , madam , to the gentler manners of Italy , you will scarcely be able to conceive to what a pitch this social hatred is carried in less favored regions . I have been forced to pass through this hard experience , and to see all dearest to me entangled in inextricable slanders . My position bore some resemblance to that of your brother , and it is for that reason I hasten to write you , in order to spare you and your family the evil I so fatally experienced . I refrain from adding other reasons , and I pray you to excuse the freedom with which I have written , since it is dictated by sincerest motives , and justified by my friend 's request . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my devotion to his interests , and to all those dear to him .

Footnote 12 : When that extravagant book " Glenarvon " appeared , Moore wrote a comic review on it , and sent the paper to Jeffrey , who thought it a good caricature , and wanted to publish it in the " Edinburgh Review . " But the friends of the author of " Glenarvon " interfered to such purpose that Jeffrey gave up the idea of mentioning the novel at all , which was also approved by Lord Byron 's friends as the best means of proving , by silence , the contempt such a book merited . Footnote 13 : Madame de Stael said one day at Coppet , with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , Lord Byron , in your bark upon the lake , accompanied by a white phantom . " " Yes , " answered he , " ' t is my dog . " Madame de Stael shook her head , not at all convinced that he kept such innocent company , for her head had been filled with fantastic tales and lies about him . In this instance , however , she was somewhat right ; for the white phantom was not only his dog , but often Mrs. Shelley , and even sometimes a young woman intimate with her . This lady , with whom he had , and would have , nothing to do , was bent on running after him , although he did all in his power to avoid her . She succeeded sometimes in getting into the boat with the Shelleys , and thus made inquisitive people talk . But Lord Byron was very innocent in it all , and even victimized , for the ennui it caused him made him quit Switzerland and the Alps , he loved so well , before the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron , " p. 177 . Footnote 15 : Lord Byron wrote to Moore in November , 1820 :  --  " Pray , where did you get hold of Goethe 's ' Florentine ' husband-killing story ? Upon such matters , in general , I may say , with Beau Clinker , in reply to Erraud 's wife :  --  " ' Oh , the villain , he hath murdered my poor Timothy ! ' " Clinker.  --  ' Damn your Timothy ! I tell you , woman , your husband has murdered me  --  he has carried away my fine jubilee clothes . ' " Footnote 16 : Moore , vol. ii . p. 782 CHAPTER IV . LORD BYRON 'S RELIGIOUS OPINIONS . " When the triumph of a cause of such importance to humanity is in question , there never can be too many advocates .... But it is not enough to count up the votes ; their value must , above all , be weighed . "  --  SHERER . The struggles between heart and reason , in religious matters , began almost with Lord Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , if unsuccessful , his mind was perplexed and restless . He was not , as it were , out of the cradle , when , in the midst of his childish play , the great problems of life already filled his youthful thoughts ; and his good nurse May , who was wont to sing psalms to him when rocking him to sleep , had also to answer questions which showed the dangerous curiosity of his mind . " Among the traits , " says Moore , " which should be recorded of his earlier years , I should mention , that , according to the character given of him by his first nurse 's husband , he was , when a mere child , ' particularly inquisitive and puzzling about religion . ' " At ten years of age , he was sent to school , at Dulwich , under the care of the Rev. Dr. Glennie , who , in the account given by him to Moore , and after speaking of the amiable qualities of Byron , adds : that " At that age he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Scriptures , and was particularly delighted when he could speak of them to him , especially on Sunday evenings after worship . " He was wont then to reason upon all the facts contained in the Bible , with every appearance of faith in the doctrine which it teaches . But while his heart was thus drawn toward its Creator , the power of his reason began imperiously to assert its rights . As long as he remained sheltered under his father 's roof , under the eyes of his mother , and of young ecclesiastics who were his first teachers , and whose practice agreed with their teaching ,  --  as long as his reason had not reached a certain degree of development ,  --  he remained orthodox and pious . But when he went to college , and particularly when he was received at Cambridge , a vast field of contradictions opened before his observing and thinking mind . His reflections , together with the study of the great psychological questions , soon clouded his mind , and threw a shade over his orthodoxy . If Lord Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier age than ordinary children , the simple faith of his childhood , the fact is not to be wondered at . By the universality of his genius he added to the faculties which form the poet , those of an eminently logical and practical mind ; and being precocious in all things , he was likewise so in his powers of reflection and reasoning . " Never , " says Moore , " did Lord Byron lose sight of reality and of common practical sense ; his genius , however high it soared , ever preserved upon earth a support of some kind . " His intellectual inquisitiveness was likewise , with him , a precocious passion , and circumstances stood so well in the way to serve this craving , that when fifteen years of age ( incredible as it seems ) , he had already perused two thousand volumes , among which his powerful and vivid intellect had been able to weigh the contradictions of all the principal modern and ancient systems of philosophy . This thirst for knowledge ( anomalous according to the rules of both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed in him together with a passionate love for boyish play , and the indulgence in all the bodily exercises , in which he excelled , and on which he prided himself . But as he stored his mind after the usual college hours , and apart from the influences of that routine discipline , which , with Milton , Pope , and almost all the great minds , he so cordially hated , the real progress of his intellect remained unobserved by his masters , and even by his fellow-students . This mistake , on the part of men little gifted with quickness of perception , was not shared by Disraeli , who could so justly appreciate genius ; and of Byron he spoke as of a studious boy , who loved to hide this quality from his comrades , thinking it more amiable on his part to appear idle in their eyes . While the young man thus strengthened his intellect by hard though irregular study , his meditative and impassioned nature , feeling in the highest degree the necessity of confirming its impressions , experienced more imperatively than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining the traditional teachings which had been transmitted to him . Byron felt the necessity of inquiring on what irrevocable proofs the dogmas which he was called upon to believe were based . Holy writ , aided by the infallibility of the teachings of the Church , etc. , were adduced as the proofs he required . He was wont , therefore , to read with avidity a number of books treating on religious matters ; and he perused them , both with artless ingenuity and in the hope of their strengthening his faith . But , could he truly find faith in their pages ? Are not such books rather dangerous than otherwise for some minds ? " The truth is , " says the author of the " Essays , " " that a mind which has never entertained a doubt in revelation , may conceive some doubts by reading books written in its defense . " And he adds elsewhere , in speaking of the writers of such controversial works , that " impatient of the least hesitation , they deny with anger the value of their adversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting over difficulties , a humor which injures the effects of their reasoning , and of the proofs they make use of to help their arguments . " After reading several of these books , he must have found , as did the great Pitt , " that such readings provoke many more doubts than they dispel ; " and , in fact , they rather disquieted and shook , than strengthened his faith . At the same time , he was alive to another striking contradiction . He noticed that the men who taught the doctrines , too often forgot to make these and their practice agree ; and in losing his respect for his masters , he still further doubted the sincerity of their teaching . Thus , while remaining religiously inclined , he must have felt his faith becoming more and more shaken , and in the memorandum of his early days , after enumerating the books treating upon religious subjects which he had read , he says : " All very tedious . I hate books treating of religious subjects ; although I adore and love God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this state of mind , of which one especially finds a proof in his earlier poems , the philosophy of Locke , which is that professed at Cambridge , and which he had already skimmed , as it were , together with other philosophical systems , became his study . It only added an enormous weight in the way of contradictions to the already heavy weight of doubt . Could it be otherwise ? Does not Locke teach that all ideas being the creation of the senses , the notion of God , unless aided by tradition , has no other basis but our senses and the sight of the external world ? If this be not the doctrine professed by Locke , it is the reading which a logical mind may give to it . He believes in God ; yet the notion of God , as it appears from his philosophical teaching , is not that which is taught by Christian doctrine . According to him , God is not even proclaimed to be the Creator of the Universe . But even were He proclaimed such , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be that God is distinct from the world ? Would God possess then all those attributes which reason , independently of all philosophy , points to in the Divinity ? Would power , goodness , infinite perfection be God 's ? Certainly not : as we are unable to know Him except through a world of imperfections , where good and evil , order and confusion , are mixed together , and not by the conception of the infinite , which alone can give us a true and perfect idea of God , it follows that God would be much superior to the world , but would not be absolute perfection . After this depreciation of the Omnipotent , what says this philosophy of our soul ? It does away altogether with one of the essential proofs of its spiritual nature , and thereby compromises the soul itself , declaring as it does , that " it is not unlikely that matter is capable of thought . " But then of what necessity would the soul be , if the body can think ? How hope for immortality , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? As for our liberty , it would be annihilated as a consequence of such doctrines ; for it is not supposed to derive its essence from the interior activity of the soul , but would seem to be limited to our power of moving . Yet we are hourly experiencing what our weakness is in comparison with the power of the laws of nature , which rule us in every sense and way . In making , therefore , all things derivable from sensations , Locke fell from one error into another , and nearly arrived at that point when duty and all principles of justice and morality might be altogether denied . Being himself , however , both good , honest , liberal , and Christian-minded , he could only save himself from the social wreck to which he exposed others , by stopping on the brink of the abyss which he had himself created , and by becoming in practice inconsistent with his speculative notions . His successors , such as Condillac and Cabanis , fell by following his system and by carrying it too far . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining the religious truths which are the grounds of all moral teaching , and which allows tradition the privilege only of bestowing faith ; a system of metaphysics , which can not avoid the dangers in which morality must perish , owing to its contradictions and its inconsistencies , must be perilous for all but those happily constituted minds for whom simple faith and submission are a part of their essence , who believe on hearsay and seek not to understand , but merely glance at the surface of the difficult and venturesome questions which are discussed before them , either because they feel their weakness , or because the light of revelation shines upon them so strongly as to make that of reason pale . For more logical minds , however , for such who are inquisitive , whose reason is both anxious and exacting , who want to understand before they believe , for whom the ties which linked them to tradition have been loosened , owing to their having reflected on a number of contradictions ( the least of which , in the case of Lord Byron , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and adopted in a clerical university ) ; for minds like these such doctrines must necessarily lead to atheism . Though Lord Byron 's mind was one of these , he escaped the fearful results by a still greater effort of his reason , which made him reject the precepts of the sensualists , and comprehend their inconsistencies . His protest against the doctrines of the sensualists is entered in his memorandum , where , after naming all the authors of the philosophical systems which he had read , and , coming to the head of that school , he exclaims from the bottom of his heart : " Hobbes ! I detest him ! " And notwithstanding the respect with which the good and great Locke must individually have inspired him , he evidently must have repudiated his precepts , inasmuch as they were not strong enough to uproot from his mind the religious truths which reason proclaims , nor prevent either his coming out of his philosophical struggle a firm believer in all the dogmas which are imperiously upheld to the human reason , or his proclaiming his belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the immortality of the soul . This glorious and noble victory of his mind and true religious tendencies at that time , is evinced in his " Prayer to Nature , " written when he had not yet reached his eighteenth year . In this beautiful prayer , which his so-called orthodox friends succeeded in having cut out of the volume containing his earliest poems , we find both great power of contemplation and humility and confidence in prayer  --  a soul too near the Creator to doubt of His Omnipotence , but also too far from Him for his faith and confidence in the divine mercy not to be mixed up with a little fear ; in fact , all the essential elements of a noble prayer which is not orthodox . Though written on the threshold of life , he might , with few modifications , have signed it on the eve of his death ; when , still young , fate had spared him nothing , from the sweetest to the bitterest feelings , from every deserved pleasure to every undeserved pain . THE PRAYER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven ! Hear'st thou the accents of despair ? Can guilt like man 's be e'er forgiven ? Can vice atone for crimes by prayer ? Father of Light , on thee I call ! Thou seest my soul is dark within ; Thou who canst mark the sparrow 's fall , Avert from me the death of sin . No shrine I seek , to sects unknown ; Oh , point to me the path of truth ! Thy dread omnipotence I own ; Spare , yet amend , the faults of youth . Let bigots rear a gloomy fane , Let superstition hail the pile , Let priests , to spread their sable reign , With tales of mystic rites beguile . Shall man confine his Maker 's sway To Gothic domes of mouldering stone ? Thy temple is the face of day ; Earth , ocean , heaven , thy boundless throne . Shall man condemn his race to hell , Unless they bend in pompous form ? Tell us that all , for one who fell , Must perish in the mingling storm ? Shall each pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expire , Whose soul a different hope supplies , Or doctrines less severe inspire ? Shall these , by creeds they ca n't expound , Prepare a fancied bliss or woe ? Shall reptiles , grovelling on the ground , Their great Creator 's purpose know ? Shall those who live for self alone , Whose years float on in daily crime  - -  Shall they by faith for guilt atone , And live beyond the bounds of Time ? Father ! no prophet 's laws I seek ,  - -  Thy laws in Nature 's works appear ;  - -  I own myself corrupt and weak , Yet will I pray , for thou wilt hear ! Thou , who canst guide the wandering star Through trackless realms of aether 's space ; Who calm'st the elemental war , Whose hand from pole to pole I trace : Thou , who in wisdom placed me here , Who , when thou wilt , canst take me hence , Ah ! while I tread this earthly sphere , Extend to me thy wide defence . To Thee , my God , to thee I call ! Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fall , In thy protection I confide . If , when this dust to dust 's restored , My soul shall float on airy wing , How shall thy glorious name adored Inspire her feeble voice to sing ! But , if this fleeting spirit share With clay the grave 's eternal bed , While life yet throbs I raise my prayer , Though doom 'd no more to quit the dead . To Thee I breathe my humble strain , Grateful for all thy mercies past , And hope , my God , to thee again This erring life may fly at last . December 29 , 1806 . First published , 1830 . As much may be said of another poem which he likewise wrote in his youth ; when , very dangerously ill , and believing his last end to be near , he turned all his thoughts to the other world , and conceived the touching poem which ended in the lines :  --  " Forget this world , my restless sprite ; Turn , turn thy thoughts to Heaven ; There must thou soon direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Byron did not adopt Locke 's philosophy he at least paid the greatest tribute of regard to his goodness by following ever more closely his best precept , which is to the effect that to love truth for the sake of truth is an essential part of human perfection in this world , and the fertile soil on which is sown the seed of every virtue . While his mind thus wavered between a thousand contradictory opinions , and , finding part of the truth only in every philosophical system which he examined , but not the whole truth  --  which was what his soul thirsted for ; calling himself at times skeptic , because he hesitated in adhering to one school , in consequence of the numerous errors and inconsistencies common to all ( the great school which has , to the honor of France , harmonized them all , was not yet open ) ; but not losing sight of the great eternal truths of which he felt inwardly the proofs , he made the acquaintance of a young man who had just completed his university education with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great influence over all his fellow-students , owing to his superior intellect , influenced Byron in a similar manner . Bold , logical , inflexible , he was not swayed by the dangers which the sensualistic teaching presented to all logical minds ; dangers which had frightened the chief of that school himself , and who , in wishing to oppose them , had not been able to do so except by contradictions . This young man , by a noble inconsistency , drew back in presence of the moral conclusions of that metaphysical doctrine , but not without culling from the master 's thoughts conclusions , such that they leave all that is spiritual and immortal without defense , together with all the legitimate inferences to be derived from the principles he taught , however impious or absurd . Among the Germans he had likewise met with several bold doctrines ; but , merely to speak here of the conclusions to which the school he belonged necessarily brought him , he arrived at those conclusions by a series of deductions from the study of those great questions , which experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Compelled by the tenets of that school , to solve all these problems by means of the sensations only , he was naturally led to the conclusion that no such thing existed as the spirituality of the soul , and hence , that it had neither the gift of immortality nor that of liberty , nor any principles of morality . Finally , obliged to seek in tradition the conviction that a God existed , and that He can only be perceived through a maze of imperfections , and not as reason conceives Him clearly and simply with all His necessary attributes of perfection , he was even led to the necessity of losing sight of a Creator altogether . The fatal precipice , which this young student himself avoided by the practical conclusions by which he abided , Byron likewise escaped both by his conclusions and his theoretical notions . He even hated the name of atheist to that degree , that at Harrow he wished to fight his companion Lord Althorpe , because he had written the word atheist under Byron 's name . This is so true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ever be given without making allowances for the intolerant spirit and the exaggeration required by his notions of orthodoxy and by his party prejudices , after regretting that Lord Byron should not have had a shield during his minority to protect him against his comrades , " proud , free-thinking , and acute sophists , " as he calls them , adds that , if surprise must be expressed , it is not that Byron should have erred , but that he should have pierced the clouds which surrounded him , and have dispersed them by the sole rays of his genius . So many struggles , however , so many contradictions , so many strains upon the mind , while leaving his heart untouched , could not but multiply the doubts which he conceived , and more or less modify his mind , and even give to it a tinge of skepticism . When he left England for the first time , his mind was in this transitory , suffering state . The various countries which he visited , the various creeds with which he became acquainted the intolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to their superstitious and irrational practices ; the truly touching piety which he found in the Greek monasteries ( at Zytza and at Athens ) , in the midst of which and in the silence of whose cloisters , he loved to share the peace and even the austerities of a monkish life ; his transition from the Western countries , where reason is placed above imagination , to the East , where the opposite is aimed at  --  all contributed to prevent what was vacillating in his mind from becoming settled . Meanwhile endless disappointments , bitter sorrows , and broken illusions contributed their share to the pain which his mind experienced at every stage of its philosophical inquiry , and contributed to give him , in the loneliness of his life , a tinge of misanthropy opposed to his natural character , which suggested the rather philosophical and generous than prudent conception of " Childe Harold 's Pilgrimage , " where he depicts his hero as intellectually imbued with philosophical doctrines which lead practical minds to skepticism and materialism ! These doctrines resulted in causing " Childe Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul by insuring conviction to the mind . The poet shows the impossibility of withdrawing himself from their disastrous results when arrived at the age when passions assert their rule , and when in a certain social position , they must be carried into practice . Nature not having gifted him with a sufficiently generous heart to check the disease of his mind , Childe Harold , disgusted with the sins of his youth , no longer seeks the road to virtue , but begins to experience with Solomon the vanity of human things , becomes a prey to satiety , ennui , and to insensibility to both physical and moral worth . Byron , who made the intellectual education of his day responsible for Childe Harold 's faults , had conceived this character in his earliest days at Harrow . It was in any case , he said , a characteristic of the youth of those days , although idealized and drawn from his own imagination . His enemies and his rivals have endeavored to prove that he wished to describe in this poem the state of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local circumstances , to give to their falsehood some appearance of truth . But only those who did not know him personally could be ignorant how improbable it was that any resemblance between the poet and his hero could be maintained . Let us confine ourselves to the remark that Lord Byron , instead of personifying his hero , personifies no one but simply the poet . Let us add , besides , that in no case could Lord Byron be made responsible for the consequences of the doctrines of the materialists , as held by his hero . Not only because of his nature , which was totally opposed to them , but also and especially because of his tendencies , which were eminently and persistently those of a spiritualist , and which clung to him throughout his life even at the time when he was accused of skepticism . This was at the time when he wrote the second canto of " Childe Harold . " Thoughts , little in unison with , if not entirely opposed to his intimate convictions , sprang from his sick heart to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copious tears so obscured his eyes as to veil from them for a time the existence of the Almighty , which he seemed to question ; and he appeared to think that if the Cambridge philosophy was right in doubting the soul 's spirituality , its immortality might be equally questioned . These doubts having been expressed in his own , and not in his hero 's name , at the outset of the second canto of " Childe Harold , " led to his being also accused of skepticism . But if pain actually paralyzed for a time the elasticity of his mind , the latter very soon recovered its natural vigor and showed itself in all its glowing energy in the eighth and ninth stanzas , which are most delicate emanations from a beautiful soul . The first stanzas alone , however , continued to occupy the attention of some orthodox and over-scrupulous minds : poetry not necessarily being a mode of teaching philosophy . We must besides remark that the meaning of the lines is purely hypothetical . In saying that the soul might not be immortal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Locke in the words the soul is perhaps spiritual ? Is not that perishable which is capable of dissolution according to the laws of the world ? Lord Byron , though a stanch spiritualist at heart , derived his doubts from other much less exalted authorities . Believing implicitly in the omnipotence of the Creator , could he not modestly fear that God , who had made his soul out of nothing , might cause it to return to nothing ? Might he not imagine that the contrary belief was rather the result of our wishes , of our pride , and of the importance which we love to attach to ourselves ? Can the conviction of the existence of immortality , unless founded upon revelation , be any thing else but a hope or a sentiment ? Pantheists alone find immortality to be the fatal consequence of their presumptuous doctrine . But what an immortality ! One to be laughed at , as a philosopher of our days so well expresses it . Accused of skepticism , Byron replied by explaining the meaning of his lines in a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also consented to suppress with his habitual good-nature , and in which he endeavored to show that the spirit which pervaded the whole of the poem was rather one of discouragement and despair , than raillery at religion , and that , after all , the effect of religion upon the world had been less to make men love their equals than to excite the various sects to a hatred against one another , and thus give rise to those fanatical wars which have caused so much bloodshed and injured so deeply the cause which they were intended to defend . In reading this note again , one can with difficulty make out what Dallas 's objections were , and why he tried so hard to have it suppressed ; for it savors much more of a spirit of toleration and charity than of skepticism . Lord Byron nevertheless withdrew it . But this was not enough to satisfy the British straight-lacedness . As the accusations against his skepticism were on the increase daily , Mr. Gifford , for whose enlightened opinion Byron ever had great respect , advised him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will do as you advise in regard to religious matters . The best would perhaps be to avoid them altogether . Certainly the passages already published are rather too rigorously interpreted . I am no bigot of incredulity , and I did not expect that I should be accused of denying the existence of God , because I had expressed some doubts as to the immortality of the soul .... After all , I believe my doubts to be but the effects of some mental illness . " It is clear from this letter , the tone of which is so honest and sincere , that if in the stanzas which his rivals blamed there was really more skepticism than can be gathered from the consideration of man 's littleness and God 's greatness , yet it was not his real conviction . Perhaps it was only a kind of cloud overhanging the mind , produced by the great grief which weighed on his heart . These sentiments , however , must have been really his own for some time longer . In his journal of 1813 he expresses himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something within that ' passeth show . ' It is for him who made it to prolong that spark of celestial fire which illuminates yet burns this frail tenement .... In the mean time I am grateful for some good , and tolerably patient under certain evils , grace a Dieu et a mon bon temperament . " But all this , as we have said , amounted to the opinion that an omnipotent God is the author of our soul , which is of a totally different nature to that of our body , and that the soul being spiritual and not subjected to the laws which rule the body , the soul must be immortal . That he who made it out of nothing can cause it to return to nothing . The orthodox doctrine does not teach , as pantheism does , that our soul can not perish . It gives it only an individual immortality . Notwithstanding this , and indeed on account of it , he was accused of being an atheist , in a poem entitled " Anti-Byron . " This poem was the work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a party . Murray hesitated to publish it , but Byron , who was always just , praised the poem , and advised its publication . " If the author thinks that I have written poetry with such tendencies , he is quite right to contradict it . " But having done so much for others , this time , at least , he fulfilled a duty toward himself by adding :  --  " The author is however wrong on one point ; I am not in the least an atheist ; " and ends by saying , " It is very odd ; eight lines may have produced eight thousand , if we calculate what has been and may still be said on the subject . " He speaks of the same work to Moore , in the same tone of pleasantry :  --  " Oh , by-the-by , I had nearly forgot . There is a long poem  --  an ' Anti-Byron '  --  coming out , to prove that I have formed a conspiracy to overthrow by rhyme all religion and government , and have already made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and ethereal . I never felt myself important till I saw and heard of my being such a little Voltaire as to induce such a production . " He therefore laughed at these accusations as too absurd . As for skepticism , he did not defend himself from a touch of it ; for not only did he feel that the suspicious stanza could partly justify the belief , but also because there did exist in him a kind of religious skepticism which proceeded far more from meditation and observation than from a passion for it . Such a skepticism is in truth a sigh for conviction . A painful vision which appears to most reflective minds in a more or less indistinct and vague manner , but which appeared more forcibly to him , inasmuch as it sought to be expressed in words . " He , " says Montaigne , " who analyzes all the circumstances which have brought about matters , and all the consequences which have been derived from them , debars himself from having any choice , and remains skeptical . " This skepticism of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of permissible doubt , as prescribed by an intelligence desirous of improvement . This privilege he exercised ; and one might say that he remained , as it were , suspended between heaven and earth , ever looking up toward heaven , from whence he felt that light must come in the end ,  --  a light ever on the increase , which would daily steady him in the great principles which form the fundamental basis of truth ,  --  one God the creator , the real immortality of our soul , our liberty and our responsibility before God . Tired , however , of ever being the butt of the invectives of his enemies , and of the clergy , whom he had roughly handled in his writings , Lord Byron preferred remaining silent ; and until his arrival in Switzerland he ceased making any allusions in his writings to any philosophical doubts which he may have entertained . The heroes which he selected for his Oriental poems were , moreover , too passionate to allow the mysterious voices from heaven to silence the cries from their heart . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although absorbed himself by various passions of a different kind ; he was at that time almost surrounded by an idolizing public , and rocked in the cradle of success and popularity . This is but too visible whenever he ceases to talk the language of his heroes , and expresses merely his own ideas and his own personal feelings . It was at this time that he wrote those delicious " Hebrew Melodies , " in which a belief in spirituality and immortality is everywhere manifest , and in which is to be found the moral indication , if not the metaphysical proof , of the working of his mind in a religious point of view , as he matured in years . Two of these Melodies especially , the third and the fifteenth , contain so positive a profession of faith in the spiritualist doctrines , and carry with them the mark of so elevated a Christian sentiment , that I can not forbear quoting them in extenso .

There is no passage in Plato , or in St. Augustin , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was in this painful state of mind that he spent the unfortunate year of his marriage . Having separated from his wife , he came to Geneva . Here , at the same hotel  --  Hotel de Secheron  --  Shelley had also arrived , who some years previously had offered Byron a copy of his poem entitled " Queen Mab . " Here they became acquainted . Although only twenty-three years of age , Shelley had already experienced much sorrow during his short existence . Born of rich and aristocratic parents , and who professed very religious and Tory principles , Shelley had been sent to Eton at thirteen . His character was most peculiar . He had none of the tastes of the young , could not stand scholastic discipline , despised every rule and regulation , and spent his time in writing novels . He published two when fifteen years old only , which appeared to be far above what could be expected from a boy of his age , but which deserved censure from their immoral tone . Owing to the nature of his mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Shelley had conceived a great taste for the books which were disapproved of at college . Consequently the doctrines of the materialist school , which were the most in fashion then both in France and in England , so poisoned his mind as to cause him to become an atheist , and to argue as such against several theologians . He even published a pamphlet , so exaggerated in tone that he entitled it , " On the Necessity of Atheism . " To crown this folly , Shelley sent round to all the bishops a copy of this work , and signed it with his own name . Brought before the authorities to answer the charge of this audacious act , he persisted in his doctrines , and was actually preparing an answer to the judges in the same sense , when he was expelled from the university . For people who know England a little , it is easy to conceive what an impression such conduct must have produced on the part of the eldest son of a family like his , of Tory principles , belonging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stanch , orthodox and severe in their religious tenets . Expelled from college , he was likewise sent away from home ; and when his indignant father consented to see him again , Shelley was treated with such coldness that he was enraged at being received as a stranger in the bosom of a family of which he was the eldest son . This was not all : even the young lady for whom Shelley had already conceived an affection , deemed it right to cast him off . Overwhelmed by all these but too well merited misfortunes , he took refuge in an inn , where he tried to poison himself . As he was struggling between life and death , a young girl of fifteen , Miss Westbrook , took care of him . Believing himself to be past recovery , and having no other means of rewarding her attention except by marrying her , he did so , in the hope that after his death his family would provide for her . But it is not always so easy to die , and he did not die . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that remained to him besides was an ill-assorted marriage . After the Gretna Green ceremony , Shelley went to reside in Edinburgh . His marriage so exasperated his father , that from that time he ceased to have any intercourse with him . From Scotland Shelley went to Ireland , which was then in a very disturbed state . His metaphysics led him to conceive the most dangerous social theories . Conquered by a very real love of humanity , which he hoped to serve by the realization of his chimerical views , he even believed it to be his duty to make proselytes . While recommending the observance of peace , and of a spirit of moderation on the one hand , he , on the other , published pamphlets and spoke at meetings with a degree of talent which earned for him a certain amount of reputation , if not of fame . Then he was seized with a violent admiration for the English school called " Lockists , " and devoted himself to poetry by way of giving a literary expression to his metaphysical reveries , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mab , " a poem full of talent and imagination , but which is only the frame which encircles his most deplorable fancies . He sent a copy of it to all the noted literary men of England , and among them to Lord Byron , whose star had risen since the publication of " Childe Harold . " Lord Byron declared , as may be seen in a note to the " Due Foscari , " that the metaphysical portion of the poem was quite in opposition with his own opinions ; but , with his usual impartiality and justice , he admired the poetry which is noticeable in this work , agreeing in this " with all those who are not blinded by bigotry and baseness of mind . " Shelley 's marriage , contracted as it was under such strange auspices , was , of course , very unfortunate . By his acquaintance with Godwin , one of the greatest literary characters of his day , Shelley came to know Mary , his daughter , by his marriage with the celebrated Mrs. Woolstonecraft . Each fell in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry Miss Godwin . He separated from the wife he had chosen only from grateful motives , although he had two children by her , and he left England for the first time , where he had become the object of persecutions of all kinds , and of a hatred which at a later period culminated in taking away his right to the guardianship of his children . Such was his position when Lord Byron arrived in Switzerland , and alighted at the Hotel Secheron . To make acquaintance , therefore , with the author of " Queen Mab , " and with the daughter of Godwin , for whom he entertained great regard , was a natural consequence on the part of the author of " Childe Harold . " Notwithstanding their difference of character , their diversity of taste , and their different habits , owing to the very opposite mode of living which they had followed , the two poets felt drawn to one another by that irresistible sympathy which springs up in the souls of two persecuted beings , however just that persecution may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regards Byron . Here we must allow Moore to speak :  --  " The conversation of Shelley , from the extent of his poetic reading , and the strange , mystic speculations into which his systems of philosophy led him , was of a nature strongly to interest the attention of Lord Byron , and to turn him away from worldly associations and topics into more abstract and untrodden ways of thought . As far as contrast indeed is an enlivening ingredient of such intercourse , it would be difficult to find two persons more formed to whet each other 's faculties by discussion , as on few points of common interest between them did their opinions agree : and that this difference had its root deep in the conformation of their respective minds , needs but a glance through the rich , glittering labyrinth of Shelley 's pages to assure us . " In Lord Byron , the real was never forgotten in the fanciful . However Imagination had placed her whole realm at his disposal , he was no less a man of this world than a ruler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and most subtle creations of his brain , still the life-blood of truth and reality circulates . With Shelley it was far otherwise : his fancy was the medium through which he saw all things , his facts as well as his theories ; and not only the greater part of his poetry , but the political and philosophical speculations in which he indulged , were all distilled through the same over-refining and unrealizing alembic . Having started as a teacher and reformer of the world , at an age when he could know nothing of the world but from fancy , the persecution he met with on the threshold of this boyish enterprise only confirmed him in his first paradoxical views of human ills , and their remedies . Instead of waiting to take lessons from those of greater experience , he with a courage , admirable , had it been but wisely directed , made war upon both .... With a mind , by nature , fervidly pious , he yet refused to acknowledge a Supreme Providence , and substituted some airy abstraction of ' Universal Love ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I understand , also in appearance and manners , he was yet a leveller in politics , and to such an utopian extent as to be the serious advocate of a community of goods . Though benevolent and generous to an extent that seemed to exclude all idea of selfishness , he yet scrupled not , in the pride of system , to disturb wantonly the faith of his fellow-men , and , without substituting any equivalent good in its place , to rob the wretched of a hope , which , even if false , would be better than all this world 's best truths . " Upon no point were the opposite tendencies of the two friends more observable than in their notions on philosophical subjects : Lord Byron being , with the great bulk of mankind , a believer in the existence of matter and evil , while Shelley so far refined upon the theory of Berkeley , as not only to resolve the whole of creation into spirit , but to add also to this immaterial system , some pervading principle , some abstract nonentity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least for Deity  --  the philosophic bishop had never dreamed . " The difference existing between their philosophical doctrines was that which existed between the two most opposed systems of spiritualism and pantheism . I said that Shelley , notwithstanding his originality of mind , was destined , through the mobility of his impressions , to be easily influenced by what he read . The study of Plato and of Spinoza had already given to his metaphysical views a different bent . But before his transition from atheism to a mystical pantheism , before finding God in all things , after having sought him in vain everywhere , before considering himself to be a fragment of a chosen existence , and before shutting himself up in a kind of mysticism which did actually absorb him at a later period , he confined himself to a positive worship of nature , which appeared to him then in the glorious shape of the mountains and lakes of Helvetia . Wordsworth was his oracle , and thus cultivating a poetry which deified nature , Shelley , in reality , remained at heart an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiasm and with his opinions . Himself greatly delighted with the beauties of the scenery in the midst of which they lived , and , as he was wont to say in laughter , having received many large doses of Wordsworth from Shelley , Lord Byron wrote several stanzas in which the same enthusiasm may be met with , recorded in terms almost of adoration . It was only a poetical form , however , a poetical illusion , which was succeeded by stanzas in which God himself as our creator , was loudly proclaimed . If in the seventy-second and following stanzas of the third canto , opinions were expressed which savored of pantheistic tendencies , they were at once followed by some such as these :  --  " All heaven and earth are still  --  though not in sleep , But breathless , as we grow when feeling most ; And silent , as we stand in thought too deep :  - -  All heaven and earth are still : from the high host Of stars to the lull 'd lake and mountain-coast , All is concentred in a life intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf is lost , But hath a part of being , and a sense Of that which is of all Creator and Defense . " And again , on viewing the Alps , he writes the poem of " Manfred , " in which his belief in a One God , and Creator , is expressed in sublime lines . His repugnance to atheism and to materialism is testified not only in his poetry , but also by his own actions . On reaching Montauvert with his friend Hobhouse , and on the point of ascending Mont Blanc with him , he found Shelley 's name in the register of the travellers , and under it the qualification of " atheist " written in Shelley 's own hand . Lord Byron at once scratched it out . But on reading , a little below , a remark by another traveller , who had justly rebuked Shelley 's folly , Byron added the words , " The appellation is well deserved . " He soon after left the Alps , and came to Italy , without his views , either philosophical or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " that serpent , " as he jokingly denominated Shelley . We shall now follow him , step by step , until the end of his life , and we shall see whether he will not show himself stanch in his adherence to great principles . Lord Byron had enough of systems , and was disgusted with their absurdity , their proud dogmatical views , and their intolerant spirit . Whenever the great questions of life and the dictates of the soul occupy his thoughts , either in the silence of the night or in the absence of passion , we shall see him set himself resolutely to the examination of his own conscience , for the purpose of arriving at truth and justice . The answers which his powerful reasoning suggested to him served to determine and confirm his faith in God . On leaving Geneva , Lord Byron proceeded to Milan . " One day , " says Mr. Stendhall , who knew Lord Byron at Milan , in 1817 , and saw a great deal of him there , " some people alluded to a couplet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poet appears to take credit to himself for being an unbeliever , and expresses it in the lines which may thus be translated :  --  ' Listen , oh my son , to the thunder as it rolls . But what is it to us what Jupiter does up there ? Let us rejoice down here if betroubled above ; Let the common herd of mortals dread his blows : And let the world go to ruin , I will only think Of what pleases me ; and if I become dust again , I shall only be what I have already been . ' Lord Byron says that these lines were written under the influence of spleen . A belief in the existence of a superior Being was a necessity for the fiery and tender nature of Tasso . He was , besides , far too Platonic to try to reconcile such contrary opinions . When he wrote those lines , he probably was in want of a piece of bread and a mistress . " Lord Byron reached Venice , and there his most agreeable hours and days were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armenian priests . He also wrote , at this time , the sublimely moral poem entitled " Manfred , " in which he renders justice to the existence of God , to the free will of man , the abuse of which has resulted in the loss of " Manfred , " and retraces , in splendid lines , all the duties incumbent upon man , together with the limits which he is not allowed to pass . The apparition of his lovely and young victim , the uncertainty of her happiness , which causes Manfred 's greatest grief , and finally his supplication to her that he may know whether she is enjoying eternal bliss , ... " That I do bear This punishment for both  --  that thou wilt be One of the blessed  --  .... " the whole bears the impress of a truly religious spirit . He shortly afterward visited Rome , and finding himself in presence of St. Peter 's , he again gave expression to his religious sentiments , in the admirable fourth canto of " Childe Harold , " which Englishmen do not hesitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortal hands . TO ST . PETER . Stanza 153. * * * * * * * " Christ 's mighty shrine above his martyr 's tomb ! " Stanza 154 . " But thou , of temples old , or altars new , Standest alone , with nothing like to thee . * * * * * * * Power , glory , strength , and beauty all are aisled In this eternal ark of worship undefiled . " From Venice he went on to Ravenna . The persecution to which he was subjected , on the ground of religion and morality , on account of the publication of the two first cantos of " Don Juan , " was then at its height , and he was tormented in every possible way . It was useless for him to protest , in verse , in prose , by letter , or by words , against the accusation of his being an atheist and a skeptic . It was asserted that " Manfred " was the expression of his doubts upon the dispensation of Providence , and that his other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had tendencies of an irreverent nature in respect to the Divinity . His two famous stanzas in " Childe Harold " were always held up to him by the innumerable army of hypocrites and wicked people who assailed him . All were not hypocrites , however ; some were his enemies in good faith , but were blinded by sectarian prejudices . Among these was an Irishman of the name of Mulock , author of a work entitled " Atheism Answered . " Lord Byron one day at Ravenna received a paper from the editor of the " Bologna Telegraph , " with extracts from this work , in which " there is a long eulogium of " his " poetry , and a great compatimento for " his " misery " on account of his being a skeptic and an unbeliever in Christ ; " although , " says Mr. Mulock , " his bold skepticism is far preferable to the pharisaical parodists of the religion of the Gospel , who preach and persecute with an equally intolerant spirit . " Lord Byron , writing that day to Murray , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean by accusing me of irreligion . They may , however , have it their own way . This gentleman seems to be my great admirer , so I take what he says in good part , as he evidently intends kindness , to which I ca n't accuse myself of being insensible . " In the evening he talked to and laughed a good deal with the Countess Guiccioli about this great compatimento , 17 treating it as a great oddity . A few months later , Moore having written to him about this same Mr. Mulock , and told him that that gentleman was giving lectures upon religion , Lord Byron , while riding with the young Count G  --   --  in the forest of Ravenna , made his profession of faith , and finding his youthful companion not quite orthodox , said to him : " The nature of classical and philosophical studies generally paralyzes all logical minds , and that is why many young heads leave college unbelievers : you are even still more so , because you mix up your religious views with your political antipathies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I left college , where I had to bow to very superior and stronger minds who themselves were under various evil influences of college and of youth , I was more than heterodox . Time and reflection have changed my mind upon these subjects , and I consider Atheism as a folly . As for Catholicism , so little is it objectionable to me , that I wish my daughter to be brought up in that religion , and some day to marry a Catholic . If Catholicism , after all , suggests difficulties of a nature which it is difficult for reason to get over , are these less great than those which Protestantism creates ? Are not all the mysteries common to both creeds ? Catholicism at least offers the consolation of Purgatory , of the Sacraments , of absolution and forgiveness ; whereas Protestantism is barren of consolation for the soul . " This open profession of faith , expressed by such a man as Lord Byron , in a calm and dispassionate tone , produced a great impression upon the young count . It had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one would say that even his friends were of the same opinion . Some time had elapsed since Byron had sent a translation from the Armenian of one of the Epistles of St. Paul , which Murray delayed in publishing . Rather annoyed by this delay , Byron wrote to him on the 9th of October , 1821 , from Ravenna :  --  " The Epistle of St. Paul , which I translated from the Armenian , for what reason have you kept it back , though you published that stuff which gave rise to the ' Vampire ? ' Is it because you are afraid to print any thing in opposition to the cant of the ' Quarterly ' about Manicheism ? Let me have a proof of that Epistle directly . I am a better Christian than those parsons of yours , though not paid for being so . " If Byron hated fanatical and persecuting clergymen , he , on the other hand , entertained great regard for priests of every denomination , when he knew that they exercised their functions without fanaticism and in a tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two young clergymen , 18 both distinguished in their profession by their piety and their attainments . At Ravenna , his alms in favor of churches and monasteries were very liberal . If the organ were not in order , if the steeple wanted repairs , Lord Byron 's pecuniary assistance was asked for , and he ever gave liberally though it was for the benefit of the Catholic community . He was always indignant at his writings , especially if connected with religion , being sent back to him by Murray with alterations to which he was no party . On one occasion he reproached him in the following terms :  --  " In referring to the mistake in stanza 132 , I take the opportunity to desire that in future , in all parts of my writings referring to religion , you will be more careful , and not forget that it is possible that in addressing the Deity a blunder may become a blasphemy : and I do not choose to suffer such infamous perversions of my words or of my intentions . I saw the canto by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education to be given to his natural daughter , Allegra , who was with him at Ravenna . In writing to Mr. and Mrs. Hoppner , to give them tidings of his dear Allegra , whom he had sent to a convent in Romagna to be educated there , he declares that in presence of the political disquietude which reigned in the Romagna , he thought he could not do better than send his child to that convent . Here " she would receive a little instruction , and some notions of morality and the principles of religion . " Moore adds to this letter a note , which runs thus :  --  " With such anxiety did he look to this essential part of his daughter 's education , that notwithstanding the many advantages she was sure to derive from the kind and feminine superintendence of Mrs. Shelley , his apprehensions lest her feelings upon religious subjects might be disturbed by the conversation of Shelley himself prevented him from allowing her to remain under his friend 's roof . " The Bible , as is well known , constituted his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry of the Bible matter for inspiration . His " Hebrew Melodies " prove it , and as for the Book of Job , he used to say that it was far too sublime for him even to attempt to translate it , as he would have wished . Toward the end of his stay at Ravenna , when his genius was most fertile and almost superhuman  --  ( he wrote five dramas and many other admirable poems in fifteen months , that is to say , in less time than it requires to copy them )  --  two biblical subjects inspired his muse : " Cain , " and " Heaven and Earth . " Both were admirably suited to his pen . He naturally treated them as a philosopher , but without any preconceived notion of making any religious converts . His enemies nevertheless seized hold of these pieces , to incriminate him and impugn his religious belief . I have spoken elsewhere19 of that truly scandalous persecution . I will only add here that Moore , timid as he usually was when he had to face an unpopularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cries proceeding from party spirit , wrote to approve the beauty of the poem in enthusiastic terms , but disapproved of the harm which some doubts expressed therein might produce . Byron replied :  --  " There is nothing against the immortality of the soul in ' Cain , ' that I recollect . I hold no such opinions ; but in a drama the first rebel and the first murderer must be made to talk according to his character . " And in another letter he says , with regard to the same subject :  --  " With respect to religion , can I never convince you that I have no such opinions as the characters in that drama , which seem to have frightened every body ? Yet they are nothing to the expressions in Goethe 's ' Faust ' ( which are ten times hardier ) , and not a whit more bold than those of Milton 's ' Satan . ' My ideas of character may run away with me : like all imaginative men , I , of course , embody myself with the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen is from off the paper . " I am no enemy to religion , but the contrary . As a proof , I am educating my natural daughter a strict Catholic in a convent of Romagna , for I think people can never have enough of religion , if they are to have any . I incline myself very much to the Catholic doctrines ; but if I am to write a drama , I must make my characters speak as I conceive them likely to argue . " The sympathy of persons sincerely religious was extremely agreeable to him . A short time after he had left Ravenna for Pisa , a Mr. John Sheppard sent him a prayer he had found among the papers belonging to his young wife , whom he had lost some two years before . Lord Byron thanked him in a beautiful letter , in which he consoled the distressed husband by assuring him of his belief in immortality , and of his confidence that he would again see the worthy person whom himself he could not but admire , for her virtues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to you , " he added , " for your good wishes , and more than obliged by the extract from the papers of the beloved object whose qualities you have so well described in a few words . I can assure you that all the fame which ever cheated humanity into higher notions of its own importance , would never weigh in my mind against the pure and pious interest which a virtuous being may be pleased to take in my welfare . In this point of view I would not exchange the prayers of the deceased in my behalf for the united glory of Homer , Caesar , and Napoleon , could such be accumulated upon a living head . Do me at least the justice to suppose that ' Video meliora proboque , ' however the deteriora sequor may have been applied to my conduct . BYRON . " Not only did Lord Byron prevent his reason being influenced by the arguments of others , but even by the dictates of his own heart . Both his mind and his heart were perfectly independent of one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him unquestionably painful to see such a division , but it was the fatal result of the excessive development of the powers of each . In the same letter to Mr. Sheppard which we have quoted , and which is full of gratitude for the prayers which the young wife had addressed to heaven to obtain his conversion , Byron adds :  --  " A man 's creed does not depend upon himself : who can say , ' I will believe this , that , or the other ? ' and , least of all , that which he least can comprehend . " Walter Scott once told him in London that he was convinced he would daily become more and more religious . " What ! " vehemently replied Lord Byron , " do you believe that I could become bigoted ? " " No , " said Walter Scott , " I only think that the influence of some great mind might modify your religious views . " Galt says the same thing :  --  " A mind like Byron 's , " says he , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary men . Truth , in visiting him , must come accompanied by every kind of solemnity , and preceded by respect and reverence . A marked superiority , a recognized celebrity , were indispensable to command his sincere attention . " Without taking implicitly for granted the rather exaggerated opinion of Galt with respect to Lord Byron , we must allow that the great poet 's attention could not be captivated by reasonings of a superficial kind , but could be influenced only by great learning , and powerful arguments which had conviction for their basis . But he might have found at Pisa the great intellectual influence spoken of , for he found Shelley there . Seeing him every day , in the quiet intimacy which the delightful sojourn in Tuscany procured for them , it was easy for both to forget all the troubles of an agitated and political existence , and only to think about the world of spirits . Shelley had every opportunity for inculcating his doctrines , having , or rather being able to exercise , the most exclusive influence upon Byron 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , for what reason ? We have said that Shelley , notwithstanding his original views , his extreme readiness to be impressed by every thing he heard and saw , was often the victim of his reading . He had read a great deal , and though since he had written the " Apology for Atheism " he had not changed his mind as to his metaphysical tenets , nevertheless the study of the German philosophy , and especially of Spinoza 's , had produced on him a revolution of ideas . From a materialistic atheism , which denies the existence of God in every thing , he had gone over to a kind of mystic pantheism , which supposes God to be everywhere and in every thing . This species of pantheism is in reality but a disguised atheism , but which , in such a man as Shelley , appeared more in the actions of his life as a pervading devotion than an impious belief . Shelley ever adored all that is beautiful , true , and holy . From this it followed that his doctrines , far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the contrary , to be founded upon humility , sacrifice , and devotion to humanity . If the mystic pantheism of Spinoza could have found a living justification of its silly principles , and an excuse for its want of power , Shelley would have supplied both . The individuality , always more or less egotistical , which is prominent in the word ego , seemed positively to have ceased to exist with him : one would have said that he almost already felt himself absorbed in that universal and divine substance , which is the God of Spinoza . If in a century like ours such a philosophy as Eclecticism could return and become again a doctrinal institution , Shelley might have personified it . He had so sacrificed his individuality to chimeras of all kinds , that he appeared to consider himself a mere phenomenon , and to look upon the external world as mere fiction , in order that the impossible and never-to-be-found divinity of his dreams might occupy all the space . He was perhaps the meekest , most generous , and the most modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet persistently refused to recognize as his Creator . If , however , there was no impiety in his irreligion , no real pride , in his pride , there existed that weakness , if I may use the word , peculiar to a brain which can not grasp at reality , but adheres to a chimera as a basis for its arguments . " His works , " says Galt , " are soiled by the false judgments proceeding from a mind which made him look at every thing in a false light , and it must be allowed that that mind was either troubled or defective by nature . " If this opinion is too severe , it is , however , certain that Shelley had so exalted an imagination that his judgment suffered by it . As he is in his works , so was he in all the commonest actions of his life . A few anecdotes will serve to make him still better known . Once , at Pisa , he went to see Count Gamba , who expected him , for some charitable purpose which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burst forth suddenly , and the wind tore a tile from a roof , and caused it to fall on Shelley 's head . The blow was very great , and his forehead was covered with blood . This , however , did not in the least prevent his proceeding on his way . When Count Gamba saw him in this state he was much alarmed , and asked him how it had occurred . Shelley replied quite calmly , passing his hand over his head , just as if he had forgotten all about it , that it was true that the wind had blown down a tile which had fallen on his head , but that he would be taken care of later upon his return home . Shelley was not rich , but whenever he went to his banker 's it was necessary that no one should require his assistance , in order that the money which he had gone to fetch should come home untouched . As , on one occasion , he was returning from a visit to his banker 's , some one at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up the stairs , and throwing down his gold and notes on the floor , rushed suddenly away , crying out to Mrs. Shelley , " There , pick it all up . " This the lady did as well as she could , for she was a woman of order , and as much attached to the reality of things as her husband was wanting in that particular . I shall not multiply these characteristic instances of the man , but will only add that such incidents were by no means uncommon , nay , that they were matters of daily occurrence . There was almost a kind of analogy in his life between him and Spinoza . Notwithstanding their great qualities and merits , both were hated and persecuted for sufficiently just motives ,  --  society having the right of repudiating doctrines which tend to its destruction ; but both were persecuted in undue and unfair proportions . Both had weak and sickly constitutions . Both had great and generous souls . Both endeavored to understand the laws which govern the destiny of the world , without ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves to be practically useful to their fellow-creatures  --  a contradiction which was the effect of their too generous minds . In Shelley 's heart the dominant wish was to see society entirely reorganized . The sight of human miseries and infirmities distressed him to the greatest degree ; but , too modest himself to believe that he was called upon to take the initiative , and inaugurate a new era of good government and fresh laws for the benefit of humanity , he would have been pleased to see such a genius as Byron take the initiative in this undertaking . " He can be the regenerator of his country , " wrote Shelley , speaking of Byron , in 1818 , at Venice . Shelley therefore did his best to influence Lord Byron . But the latter hated discussions : he could not bear entering into philosophical speculation at times when his soul craved the consolations of friendship and his mind a little rest . He was quite insensible to reasonings , which often appear sublime because they are clothed in words incomprehensible to those who have not sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in favor of Shelley . He knew that he could not shake his faith in a doctrine founded upon illusions , by his incredulity : but he listened to him with pleasure , not only on account of Shelley 's good faith and sincerity of meaning , but also because he argued upon false data with such talent and originality that he was both interested and amused . But with all his great and noble qualities was it to be expected that Lord Byron would fall into the doctrines proffered by pantheists ? Doctrines rejected by reason , which wound the heart , are opposed to the most imperative necessities of our nature , and only bring desolation to our minds . Lord Byron had examined every kind and species of philosophy by the light of common sense , and by the instinct of his genius : the result had been to make him compassionate toward the vain weaknesses of the human understanding , and to convince him that all systems which have hypothesis as groundwork are illusions , and consequently likely to perish with their authors . Pantheism in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the greatest of absurdities . He made no difference between the Pantheism " absolute , " which mixes up that which is infinite with that which is finite , and that which struggles in vain to keep clear of Atheism . In an age like ours , when the common tendency is of a materialistic character , such as almost to defy the power of man , mysticism has little or no locus standi . Shelley 's opinions , on account of their appearance of spiritualism , were most likely of any to interest Byron ; but , founded as they are upon fancy , could they please him ? Could he possibly consent to lose his individuality , deny his own freedom of will , all responsibility of action , and hence all his privileges , his future existence , and all principles of morality ? Could he possibly admit that the doctrine which prescribed these sacrifices was better than any other ? Even with the best intentions , could any of the essential , moral , and holy principles of nature be introduced into such a system ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all Shelley 's views to the aberrations of a mind which is happier when it dreams than when it denies . Here , then , was the cause of his being inaccessible to Shelley 's arguments . He used sometimes to exclaim , " Why Shelley appears to me to be mad with his metaphysics . " This he one day repeated to Count Gamba at Pisa , as Shelley walked out and he came in . " We have been discussing metaphysics , " said he : " what trash in all these systems ! Say what they will , mystery for mystery , I still find that of the Creation the most reasonable of any . " He made no disguise of the difficulties which he found in admitting the doctrine of a God , Creator of the world , and entirely distinct from it ; but he added , " I prefer even that mystery to the contradictions by which other systems endeavor to replace it . " He certainly found that in the mystery of Creation there existed the proof of the weakness of our minds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too evident for a logical mind to adopt its tenets . " They find , " said he , " that reason is more easily satisfied with a system of unity like theirs , in which all is derived from one principle only : may be , but what do we ask of truth ? why all our never-ceasing efforts in its pursuit ? Is it merely that we may exercise the mind , and make truth the toy of our imagination ? Impossible . At any rate it would be a secret to which , as yet , God has not given us any clue . But in doing this , in constantly placing the phenomena of creation before us without their causes or without ever explaining them , and at the same time instilling into our souls an insatiable thirst for truth , the Almighty has placed within us a voice which at times reminds us that He is preparing some surprise for us ; and we trust that that surprise may be a happy one . " Poor Shelley lost his time with Byron . But , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar objection to Shelley himself , for whom he professed a great respect and admiration . He grieved to find so noble an intellect the victim of hallucination which entirely blinded him to the perception of truth . Shelley , however , did not despair of succeeding in making Byron some day give up what he termed his philosophical errors , and his persistency earned for him the appellation of " serpent " which Byron gave him in jest . This persistency , which at the same time indicates the merit of Byron 's resistance , has often been mentioned by Shelley himself . Writing from Pisa to a friend in England , a very few days before his death , and alluding to a letter from Moore which Byron had shown him , and wherein " Cain " was attributed to the influence which he ( Shelley ) had evidently exercised over Byron , he said , " Pray assure Moore that in a philosophical point of view I have not the slightest influence over Byron ; if I had , be sure I should use it for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived ' Cain ' many years ago , and he had already commenced writing it when I saw him last year at Ravenna . How happy I should be could I attribute to myself , even indirectly , a part in that immortal work ! " Moore wrote to Byron on the same subject a little later , and received the following reply :  --  " As for poor Shelley , who also frightens you and the world , he is , to my knowledge , the least egotistical and kindest of men . I know no one who has so sacrificed both fortune and sentiments for the good of others ; as for his speculative opinions , we have none in common , nor do I wish to have any . " All the poems which he wrote at this time , and which admitted of his introducing the religious element either purposely or accidentally into them , prove one and all that his mind , as regards religion , was as we have shown it to be . This is particularly noticeable in his mystery called " Heaven and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , such as the " Island , " and even to some passages in " Don Juan . " " Heaven and Earth "  --  a poem which appeared about this time , and which he styled " A Mystery "  --  is a biblical poem in which all the thoughts agree with the Book of Genesis , and " which was inspired , " says Galt , " by a mind both serious and patriarchal , and is an echo of the oracles of Adam and of Melchisedec . " In this work he exhibits as much veneration for scriptural theology as Milton himself . In the " Island , " which he wrote at Genoa , there are passages which penetrate the soul with so religious a feeling , that Benjamin Constant , in reading it , and indignant at hearing Byron called an unbeliever , exclaimed in his work on religion , " I am assured that there are men who accuse Lord Byron of atheism and impiety . There is more religion in the twelve lines which I have quoted than in the past , present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Even in " Don Juan , " in that admirable satire which , not being rightly understood , has given rise to so many calumnies , he says , after having spoken in the fifteenth canto of the moral greatness of various men , and among others of Socrates :  --  " And thou , Diviner still , Whose lot it is by man to be mistaken , And thy pure creed made sanction of all ill ? Redeeming worlds to be by bigots shaken , How was thy toil rewarded ? " At the end of this stanza he wrote the following note :  --   --  " As it is necessary in these times to avoid ambiguity , I say that I mean by ' Diviner still , ' Christ . If ever God was man  --  or man God  --  he was both . I never arraigned his creed , but the use or abuse made of it . Mr. Canning one day quoted Christianity to sanction negro slavery , and Mr. Wilberforce had little to say in reply . And was Christ crucified that black men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born a mulatto , to give both colors an equal chance of freedom , or at least salvation . " Notwithstanding these beautiful lines , which were equally professions of faith , England , instead of doing Byron justice , continued more than ever to persecute him . Shortly afterward he embarked at Genoa for Greece , and halted at Cephalonia . He there made the acquaintance of a young Scotchman , named Kennedy , who was attached as doctor to the Greek army . Before taking to medicine this young man had studied law , with the intention of going to the Edinburgh bar . He was so deeply convinced of the truths of Christianity , and so familiar with its teaching , that he would fain have imparted his belief to every one he met . From his position he found himself among a host of young officers , mostly Scotch , and all more or less lax in their religious practices . Among these , however , he met with four who consented to listen to his explanation of the doctrines of Christianity . As their principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine origin , he accepted the challenge in the hope of making some conversions . One of these officers informed Lord Byron of this projected meeting , and Byron , from the interest which he always took in the subject which was to be their ground of discussion , expressed a wish to be present . " You know , " said he , " that I am looked upon as a black sheep , and yet I am not as black as the world makes me out , nor worse than others , "  --  words , which , from the fact of his rarely doing himself justice , were noteworthy in his mouth . Under such auspices , then , was Kennedy fortunate enough to open his discussion , and Lord Byron was present in company of the young Count Gamba and Dr. Bruno . Mr. Kennedy has given a detailed account of this meeting , as also of his subsequent conversations with Lord Byron . We will mention some of them here , because they show Lord Byron 's religious opinions in the latter portion of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be allowed to speak , without being interrupted , but at various intervals , for twelve hours . This condition , was soon set aside , and then Lord Byron joined the conversation . After exciting admiration by his patient silence , he astounded every one as an interlocutor . If Kennedy was well versed in the Scriptures , Lord Byron was not less so , and even able to correct a misquotation from Holy Writ . The direct object of the meeting was to prove that the Scriptures contained the genuine and direct revelation of God 's will . Mr. Kennedy , however , becoming a little entangled in a series of quotations , which had not the force that was required to prove his statements , and , seeing that a little impatience betrayed itself among the audience , could not resist showing some temper , and accusing his hearers of ignorance . " Strange accusation , when applied to Lord Byron , " says Galt . Lord Byron , who had come there to be interested , and to learn , did not notice the taunt of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be desired is to be convinced of the truth of the Bible , as containing really the word of God ; for if this is sincerely believed , it must follow , as a necessary consequence , that one must believe all the doctrines contained in it . " He then added , that in his youth he had been brought up by his mother in very strict religious principles ; had read a large number of theological works , and that Barrow 's writings had most pleased him ; that he regularly went to church , that he was by no means an unbeliever who denied the Scriptures , and wished to grope in atheism ; but , on the contrary , that all his wish was to increase his belief , as half-convictions made him wretched . He declared , however , that he could not thoroughly understand the Scriptures . He also added , that he entertained the highest respect for , and confidence in , those who believed conscientiously ; but that he had met with many whose conduct differed from the principles they professed simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who really believed in the Scriptures to be very small . He asked him about his opinion as to various writers against religion , and among others of Sir W. Hamilton , Bellamy , and Warburton , who pretend that the Jews had no notion of a future existence . He confessed that the sight of so much evil was a difficulty to him , which he could not explain , and which made him question the perfect goodness of the Creator . He dwelt upon this argument a long time , exhibiting as much tenderness of heart as force of reasoning . Kennedy 's answers were weak , as must be those of one who denies the measure of evil , in order that he may not be compassionate toward it , and who promises a reward in after life to escape the necessity of its being bestowed in the present . In reply Lord Byron pointed to moral and physical evil which exists among savages , to whom Scripture is unknown , and who are bereft of all the means of becoming civilized people . Why are they deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the ultimate fate of Pagans ? He quoted several objections made to our Lord by the apostles ; mentioned prophecies which had never been fulfilled , and spoke of the consequences of religious wars . Kennedy replied with much ability , and even with a certain degree of eloquence , and prudently made use of the ordinary theological arguments . But to influence such a mind as Byron 's more was required . In the search after truth , he looked for hard logic , and eloquence was not required by him . Fenelon could not have persuaded him ; but Descartes might have influenced him . He preferred , in fact , in such arguments , the method of the geometrician to that of the artist ; the one uses truth to arrive at truth , the other makes use of the beautiful only , to arrive at the same end . The meeting lasted four hours , and created much sensation in the island , and every one agreed in praising Lord Byron 's great knowledge of the Scriptures , joined to his moderation and modesty . Kennedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his adversary , did his best to dissipate the impression produced by it . He went so far as to reproach his friends for having allowed themselves to be blinded by the rank , the celebrity , and the prestige of Lord Byron . " His theological knowledge being , " said he , " in reality quite ordinary and superficial . " This meeting was the only one in which Lord Byron took a part , for he left Argostoli for Metaxata . The meetings continued , however , for some time longer , and Kennedy showed a zeal which deserved to meet with better success . He brought before his audience with talent every possible reasoning in favor of orthodoxy ; but his audience , composed of young men , were far too engrossed with worldly occupations to be caught by the ardor of their master 's zeal . Disappointed at not seeing Lord Byron again among them , they all deserted Kennedy 's lectures just at the time when he was going to speak of miracles and prophecies , the subject of all others upon which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desert the hall , but actually overwhelmed the speaker with mockery . Some declared they would put off their conversion to a more advanced age ; others actually maintained that they had less faith than before . Meanwhile Kennedy , though disappointed in his religious enthusiasm on the one hand , received some consolation on the other , at the hands of Lord Byron , who had not forgotten him , and who often inquired after him though he had not been convinced by his arguments . Kennedy also had conceived a great liking for Byron . He admired in the poet all his graceful qualities and his unequalled talents . He wished , but dared not yet , visit Lord Byron . Meeting , however , Count Gamba at Argostoli on one occasion , and hearing from him that Byron was on the point of departure for Continental Greece , he resolved to pay him a visit , " as much , " said he , " to show the respect which is due to such a man , as to satisfy one 's own curiosity in seeing and hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his natural cordiality . He made him stay to dinner with him , and thus gave him the opportunity of entering into a long conversation . Kennedy , who never lost sight of his mission of proselytism , brought the conversation round to the object of his wishes , and prefaced his arguments by saying that he was prepared to talk upon the matter ; but that he had no doubt lost his time , since it was not likely that his lordship would consider these subjects urgent at that moment . Byron smiled and replied , " It is true that at the present time I have not given that important subject all my attention , but I should nevertheless be curious to know the motives which not only have convinced you , as a man of sense and reflection , as you undoubtedly are , of the truth of religion , but also have induced you to profess Christianity with such zeal . " " If there had been men , " said Kennedy , " who had rejected Christianity , there were greater men still who had accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have adopted it is not to act rationally , unless it is proved that the great minds which adopted it were mistaken . " " But I have not the slightest desire , " answered Byron , " to reject a doctrine without having investigated it . Quite the contrary ; I wish to believe , because I feel extremely unhappy in a state of uncertainty as to what I am to believe . " Kennedy having told him then that to obtain the grace of faith , he should pray humbly for it , Byron replied , that prayer does not consist in the act of kneeling or of repeating certain words in a solemn manner : " Devotion is the affection of the heart , and that I possess , for when I look at the marvels of creation I bow before the Majesty of Heaven , and when I experience the delights of life , health , and happiness , then my heart dilates in gratitude toward God for all His blessings . " " That is not sufficient , " continued the doctor . " I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , having prayed earnestly before that the Almighty may grant you the grace to understand it . For , however great your talents , the book will be a sealed letter to you unless the Holy Spirit inspires you . " " I read the Bible more than you think , " said Byron . " I have a Bible which my sister , who is goodness itself , gave me , and I often peruse it . " He then went into his bedroom , and brought out a handsomely-bound pocket Bible which he showed the doctor . The latter advised his continuing to read it , but expressed his surprise that Byron should not have better understood it . He looked out several passages in which it is enjoined that we should pray with humility if we wish to understand the truth of the Gospel ; and where it is expressly said that no human wisdom can fathom these truths ; but that God alone can reveal them to us , and enlighten our understanding ; that we must not scrutinize His acts , but be submissive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the sin of our first parents , and our own evil inclinations , has become for us a positive difficulty , we must change our hearts before we can obey or take pleasure in obeying the commandments of our Lord God ; and , finally , that all , whatever the rank of each , are subject to the necessity of obedience . Byron 's occupations and ideas at that time were not quite in accordance with the nature of these holy words , but he received them with his usual kind and modest manner , because they came from one who was sincere . He only replied , that , as to the wickedness of the world , he was quite of his opinion , as he had found it in every class of society ; but that the doctrines which he had put forth would oblige him to plunge into all the problems respecting the Old Testament and original sin , which many learned persons , as good Christians as Dr. Kennedy , did not hesitate to reject . He then showed the doctor , in answer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible , how conversant he was with the subject by quoting several Christian authors who thought differently . He quoted Bishop Watson , who , while professing Christianity , did not attribute such authority to the contents of the Bible . He also mentioned the Waldenses , who were such good Christians that they were called " the true Church of Christ , " but who , nevertheless , looked upon the Bible as merely the history of the Jews . He then showed that the Book of Genesis was considered by many doctors of divinity as a mere symbol or allegory . He took up the defense of Gibbon against Kennedy 's insinuation that the great historian had maliciously and intentionally kept back the truth ; he quoted Warburton as a man whose ingenious theories have found much favor with many learned persons ; finally , he proved to the doctor that , in any case , he could not himself be accused of ignorance of the subject . This conversation afforded him the opportunity also of refuting the accusation brought against him by some of his numerous enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctrines of Manicheism . Kennedy having said that the spirit of evil , as well as the angels , is subject to the will of God , Lord Byron replied ,  --   --  " If received in a literal sense , I find that it gives one a far higher notion of God 's majesty , power , and wisdom , if we believe that the spirit of evil is really subject to the will of the Almighty , and is as easily controlled by Him as the elements follow the respective laws which He has made for them . " Byron could not bear any thing which took away from the greatness of the Divinity , and his words all tended to replace the Divinity in that incomprehensible space where He must be silently acknowledged and adored . Their conversation extended to other points of religious belief . While the doctor , taking the Bible to be the salvation of mankind , indulged in exaggerated and intolerant condemnation of the Catholic Church , which he called an abominable hierarchy not less to be regretted than Deism and Socinianism , Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disapproved of the doctor 's language , he did not contradict him , believing him to be sincere in his recriminations , but brought back the conversation to that point from which common sense should never depart . He deplored with him existing hypocrisies and superstitions , which he looked upon as the cause of the unbelief of many in the existence of God ; but he added , that it was not confined to the Continent only , but likewise existed in England . Instead of resting his hopes upon the Bible , he said that he knew the Scriptures well enough " to be sure that if the spirit of meekness and goodness which the religion of the Gospel contains were put into practice by men , there would certainly be a marvellous change in this wicked world ; " and he finished by saying , that as for himself he had , as a rule , ever respected those who believed conscientiously , whatever that belief might be ; in the same manner as he detested from his heart hypocrites of all kinds , and especially hypocrites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned it to literature . All he said on that subject is so interesting that I reserve the record of it to another chapter . The doctor , however , soon resumed the former subject of their conversation , and , more in the spirit of a missionary than a philosopher , he went on to recommend the study of Christianity , which he said was summed up entirely in the Scriptures . " But what will you have me do ? " said Byron . " I do not reject the doctrines of Christianity , I only ask a few more proofs to profess them sincerely . I do not believe myself to be the vile Christian which many  --  to whom I have never done any harm , and many of whom do not even know me  --  strenuously assert that I am , and attack me violently in consequence . " The doctor insisted . " But , " said Byron , " you go too fast . There are many points still to be cleared up , and when these shall have been explained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What are those difficulties ? " replied the doctor . " If the subject is important , why delay its explanation ? You have time ; reason upon it ; reflect . You have the means of disposing of the difficulty at your command . " " True , " answered Byron , " but I am the slave of circumstances , and the sphere in which I live is not likely to make me consider the subject . " As the doctor became more urgent , Byron said  --   --  " How will you have me begin ? " " Begin this very night to pray God that he may forgive you your sins , and may grant you grace to know the truth . If you pray , and read your Bible with purity of intention , the result must be that which we so ardently wish for . " " Well , yes , " replied Byron , " I will certainly study these matters with attention . " " But your lordship must bear in mind , that you should not be discouraged , even were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be understood without sufficient time and pains . You must weigh conscientiously each argument , and continue to pray to God , in whom at least you believe , to give you the necessary understanding . " " Why then , " asked Byron , " increase the difficulties , when they are already so great ? " The doctor then took the mystery of the Trinity as an example , and spoke of it as a man who has faith and accepts the mystery as a revealed dogma . " It is not the province of man , " said he , " to comprehend or analyze the nature of an existence which is entirely spiritual , such as that of the Divinity ; but we must accept it , and believe in it , because it has been revealed to us , being fully convinced that man in his present state will never be able to fathom such mysteries . " He not only blamed those who wish to explain all things , but likewise the presumption of certain theologians in mixing up their own arguments with the revelations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trinity , and who speculate upon the attributes of the Deity to ascertain the relative mode of existence of each of the three persons who compose the Trinity . " They must fall , " he added , " or lead others to a similar end . " Hence he concluded that mysteries should be believed in implicitly , as children believe fully what their parents tell them . " I therefore advise your lordship , " said he , " to put aside all difficult subjects ,  --  such as the origin of sin , the fall of man , the nature of the Trinity , the mystery of predestination , etc. ,  --  and to study Christianity not in books of theology , which , even the best , are all more or less imperfect , but in the careful examination of the Scriptures . By comparing each part of it , you will at last find a harmony so great in all its constituent parts , and so much wisdom in its entire whole , that you will no longer be able to doubt its divine origin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " To so firm and enviable a faith , Byron replied as follows :  --  " You recommend what is very difficult ; for how is it possible for one who is acquainted with ecclesiastical history , as well as with the writings of the most renowned theologians , with all the difficult questions which have agitated the minds of the most learned , and who sees the divisions and sects which abound in Christianity , and the bitter language which is often used by the one against the other ; how is it possible , I ask , for such a one not to inquire into the nature of the doctrines which have given rise to so much discussion ? One Council has pronounced against another ; Popes have belied their predecessors , books have been written against other books , and sects have risen to replace other sects ; the Pope has opposed the Protestants and the Protestants the Pope . We have heard of Arianism , Socinianism , Methodism , Quakerism , and numberless other sects . Why have these existed ? It is a puzzle for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seem safer to say ' Let us be neutral ; let those fight who will , and when they have settled which is the best religion , then shall we also begin to study it ? ' " I , however , like , " he continued , " your way of thinking , in many respects ; you make short work of decrees and councils , you reject all which is not in harmony with the Scriptures , you do not admit of theological works filled with Latin and Greek of both high and low church , you would even suppress many abuses which have crept into the Church , and you are right ; but I question whether the Archbishop of Canterbury or the Scotch Presbyterians would consider you their ally . " As for predestination , I do not believe as S  --   --  and M  --   --  do on that subject , but as you do ; for it appears to me that I am influenced in a manner which I can not understand , and am led to do things which my will does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a supreme Ruler of the universe , and if , as you say , He rules , over both good and bad spirits , then those actions which we perform against our will are likewise under His direction . I have never tried to sift this subject , but satisfied myself by believing that there is , in certain events , a predestination which depends upon the will of God . " The doctor replied , " that he had founded his belief upon his own grounds . " The doctor then touched upon the differences which existed in religious opinions , and expressed his regret at this , while showing , nevertheless , some indulgence for those Christian sects which do not attack the actual fundamental doctrines of Christianity . But he was intolerant as regards other sects , such as Arianism , Socinianism , and Swedenborgianism , of which he spoke almost with passion . " You seem to hate the Socinians greatly , " remarked Byron , " but is this charitable ? Why exclude a Socinian , who believes honestly , from any hope of salvation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bible ? It is a religion which gains ground daily . Lady Byron is much in favor with its followers . We were wont to discuss religious matters together , and many of our misunderstandings have arisen from that . Yet , on the whole , I think her religion and mine were much alike . " Of course the doctor deplored the existence of such bold doctrines . Lord Byron then spoke of Shelley :  --  " I wish , " he said , " you had known him , and that I might have got you both together . You remind me of him , not only in looks , but by your manner of speaking . " Besides physical appearance , it is easy to understand that there existed a great likeness between the two minds , different though their moral tendencies might have been . In both could be traced that degree of mysticism and expansiveness , which make the poet and the missionary . Byron praised the virtues of Shelley , and styled them Christian , and spoke mainly of his great benevolence of character , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " replied the doctor , " such rare virtues are esteemed among Christians , but they can not be called Christian virtues , unless they spring from Christian principles : and in Shelley they were not so . His virtues might deserve human praise , they were no doubt pagan virtues ; but they were nothing in the eyes of God , since God has declared that nothing pleases Him but that which springs from a good motive , especially the love of and belief in Christ , which was wanting in Shelley . " When Kennedy had characterized Shelley in even stronger terms , Byron said to him : " I see it is impossible to move your soul to any sympathy , or even to obtain from you in common justice a little indulgence for an unfortunate young man , gifted with a lofty mind and a fine imagination . " These remarks reveal the tolerant spirit of Lord Byron , but they also show how the best natures are spoiled by dogmatism . The conversation had lasted several hours . Night was coming on , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hour . His host , however , did nothing to remind him of it , and when Kennedy got up to take his leave , he said to Byron , after making excuses for remaining so long , " God having gifted you , my lord , with a mind which can grasp every subject , I am convinced that if your lordship would devote yourself to the study of religion , you would become one of its lights , the pride of your country , and the consolation of every honest person . " Lord Byron replied :  --  " I certainly intend to study the matter , but you must give me a little time . You see that I have begun well : I listen to all you say . Do n't you find that my arguments are more like your own than you would have thought ? " " Yes , " answered the doctor , " and it gives me great pleasure . I have far better hopes of your lordship 's conversion than of that of the young officers who listened to me without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater patience and candor than I could have imagined you to be capable of ; whereas they , on the contrary , exhibited so hardened a spirit that they appeared to look upon the subject as one which lent itself admirably to ridicule and laughter . " " You must allow , " said Byron , " that in the times in which we are now living it is difficult to bestow attention to any serious religious matter . I think , however , I can promise to reflect even more on the subject than I have done hitherto , without , however , promising to adopt your orthodox views . " The doctor then asked him leave to present him with the work of B  --   --  , which he commended in high terms . Lord Byron said he would have great pleasure in reading it , and told the doctor that he should always be happy to see him , and at any time that he liked to come . " Should I be out when you come , " he added , " take my books and read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected over all that had taken place , and feared that his zeal had carried him too far  --  that his long conversation might have tired rather than interested Byron ; but on the whole , he concluded by saying to himself , " It appears to me , that Byron never exhibited the least symptom of fatigue , but , on the contrary , continually showed great attention from beginning to end . " We have , perhaps , dwelt too much in our report of this conversation , but we wished to do so for several reasons . First , because it shows , better than a public debate , the real thoughts and feelings of Byron on religious matters , next , the real nature of his religious opinions , and finally we find , in Byron 's conversation , virtues such as amiability , goodness , patience , delicacy , and toleration , which have not been sufficiently noticed . The sympathy which Kennedy had conceived for Byron after the public meeting greatly increased after this first conversation . The candor and simplicity depicted on his handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than any one else , grasp the theories of the doctor ; and the latter felt that if he could not prevail in making Byron a believer in his own orthodox views , at least he could prepare the way for the acquirement of every virtue , and he resolved , therefore , to profit by the permission given him of often visiting Byron . Meanwhile , the young officers continued their jokes , and pretended that Byron was laughing at the doctor , and making use of him in order to study Methodism , which he wished to introduce into his poem of " Don Juan . " There is , however , a community of feeling between two frank natures , and Byron felt that the doctor 's sincerity commanded respect , while the doctor , on the other hand , knew that Lord Byron was too earnest to condescend to a mockery of him . " There was , " says Kennedy , " nothing flighty in his manner with me , and nothing which showed any desire to laugh at religion . " When he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preoccupied with his approaching departure for Continental Greece , and engrossed with a multitude of various occupations and visits . Byron , nevertheless , received him most graciously , and maintained that jovial humor which was one of his characteristics in conversation . Byron had reflected a good deal since his last interview with the doctor , but the direction which his thoughts had taken was not precisely that which the doctor had advised him to pursue . They did not agree with the tenets of the doctor 's religion . The latter had not advised an unlimited use of one 's reason , but , on the contrary , had recommended reliance on the traditional and orthodox teachings of the Church . To reason , however , constituted in Byron a positive necessity . He could not admit that God had given us the power of thought not to make use of it , and obliged us to believe that which in religion , as in other things , appears ridiculous to our reason and shocks our sense of justice . " It is useless to tell me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am to believe and not to reason : you might just as well tell a man , ' Wake not , but sleep . ' Then to be threatened with eternal sufferings and torments !  --  I can not help thinking that as many devils are created by the threat of eternal punishment , as numberless criminals are made by the severity of the penal laws . " Mysteries and dogmas , however , were not objectionable to Byron . This was shown in his conversation with Kennedy on the subject of the Trinity and of predestination . However little disposed he may have been to believe in mysteries , he nevertheless bowed in submission before their existence , and respected the faith which they inspire in minds more happily constituted than his own . His partial skepticism , or rather that in him which has been so denominated , was humble and modest in comparison to Montaigne 's skepticism . Byron admitted that these were mysteries because the littleness of man and the greatness of God were ever present to him . He would have agreed with Newton in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beach with the waves which bathed the sands . The water with which he played was what he knew ; what he ignored was the widespread ocean before him . " Surrounded as we are by mysteries on all sides , he would have esteemed it presumption on his part to reject , in the name of science , all the mysteries of religion , when science itself has only to deal with phenomena . All is necessarily a mystery in its origin , and not to understand was no sufficient reason in the eyes of Byron to deny altogether the existence of matters relating to the Divinity . Could he reject religious dogmas under the pretext of not being able to understand them , when he admitted others equally difficult of comprehension , although supported by logical proofs ? Among the mysteries of religion founded entirely upon revelation , there was one , however , which not only weighed upon his mind , but actually gave him positive pain . This was the dogma of eternal punishment , which he could not reconcile with the idea of an omnipotent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which the ideal has been implanted in our hearts . Here again his objections sprang from kindness of disposition . After speaking a while on the subject of prayer , Byron said to Kennedy :  --  " There is a book which I must show you , " and , having chosen from a number of books on the table an octavo volume , entitled " Illustrations of the Moral Government of God , by E. Smith , M.D. , London , " he showed it to Kennedy , and asked him whether he knew of it . On Kennedy replying in the negative , Byron said that the author of the book proved that hell was not a place of eternal punishment . " This is no new doctrine , " replied Kennedy , " and I presume the author to be a Socinian , who , if consistent at all with his opinions , will sooner or later reject the Bible entirely , and avow himself to be what he really is already , namely , a Deist . Where did your lordship find the book ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Byron , " to convert me , I suppose . The author 's arguments are very powerful . They are taken from the Bible , and , while proving that the day will come when every intellectual being will enjoy the bliss of eternal happiness , he shows how impossible is the doctrine which pretends that sin and misery can exist eternally under the government of a God whose principle attributes are goodness and love . " " But , " said Kennedy , " how does he then explain the existence of sin in the world for upward of 6000 years ? That is equally inconsistent with the notion of perfect love and goodness as united in God . " " I can not admit the soundness of your argument , " replied Byron ; " for God may allow sin and misery to co-exist for a time , but His goodness must prevail in the end , and cause their existence to cease . At any rate it is better to believe that the infinite goodness of God , while allowing evil to exist as a means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day when every intellectual being shall be purified and freed from the bondage of sin and misery . " As Kennedy persisted in arguing against the author 's opinions , Lord Byron asked him " Why he was so desirous of proving the eternity of hell , since such a doctrine was most decidedly against the gentle and kind character of the teaching of Christ ? " To other arguments on the same subject , Byron replied , that he could not determine as to the justice of their conclusions , but that he could not help thinking it would be very desirable to show that in the end all created beings must be happy , and therefore rather agreed with Mr. Smith than with the doctor . As Lord Byron , however , had always allowed that man was free in thought and action , and therefore a responsible being made to justify the ends of Providence , he believed that Providence did give some sanction to the laws implanted in our natures . Sinners must be punished , but a merciful God must proportion punishments to the weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic belief in Purgatory , which agreed better with his own appreciation of the goodness and mercy of God . Lord Byron 's preference for Catholicism is well known . His first successes of oratory in the House of Lords were due to the cause of Catholicism in Ireland , which he defended ; and when he wished his little daughter Allegra to be brought up in the Catholic faith , he wrote to Mr. Hoppner , British consul at Venice , who had always taken a lively interest in the child , to say that :  --  " In the convent of Bagna-Cavallo she will at least have her education advanced , and her morals and religion cared for .... It is , besides , my wish that she should be a Roman Catholic , which I look upon as the best religion , as it is assuredly the oldest of the various branches of Christianity . " This predilection for Catholicism was not the result of the poetry of that religion , or of the effect which its pomps and gorgeous ceremonies produced upon the imagination . They , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily impressed as his , but not sufficient to justify his preference ; for Byron , although a poet , never allowed his reason to be swayed by his imagination . He reasoned upon every subject . His objections proceeded as much from his mind as his heart . " Catholicism , " he was wont say , " is the most ancient of worships ; and as for our own heresy , it unquestionably had its origin in vice . With regard to those difficulties which baffle our understanding , are they more easily explained by Protestants than by Catholics ? " Catholicism , at least , is a consoling religion , and its belief in Purgatory conciliates the justice of the Almighty with His goodness . Why has Protestantism given up so human a belief ? To intercede for and do good to beings whom we have loved here below , is to be not altogether separated from them . " " I often regretted , " he said on one occasion at Pisa , " that I was not born a Catholic . Purgatory is a consoling doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or that they did not at least substitute for it something equally consoling . " " It is , " he remarked to Shelley , " a refinement of the doctrine of transmigration taught by your stupid philosophers . " It was , therefore , chiefly this doctrine , and his abhorrence of Calvin , which attracted Byron toward Catholicism . A comparison was made before him , on one occasion , between Catholicism and Protestantism . " What matters , " said Byron , " that Protestantism has decreased the number of its obligations , and reduced its articles of faith ? Both religions proceed from the same origin ,  --  authority and examination . It matters little that the measures of either be different ; but why does the Protestant deny to the Catholic the privilege , which he claims more than he uses , of free examination ? Catholics also claim the right of proving the soundness of their belief , and , therefore , admit likewise the right of discussion and examination . As for authority , if the Catholic obeys the Church and considers it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible ? And while recognizing the authority of the Church on the one hand , on the other he claims a right to free examination , does he not incur the liability of being thought inconsistent ? And , after all , is not the authority of the Church the better of the two ? There seems to greater peace for the mind who confides in it , than in the belief in the authority of a book , where one must ever seek the way to salvation by becoming a theologian , as it were . And is it not fairer to have certain books , such , for instance , as the ' Apocalypse , ' explained to us by the Church , than to have them expounded by people more or less well informed or prejudiced ? " Such were Byron 's views , if not his very words . Before Byron left for Greece , Kennedy had several other conversations with him ; but as the limits of this chapter do not allow of my entering into them , I will merely add that they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gentleness of his nature in dealing with persons of contrary opinions to his own , but who argued honestly and from conviction . So it came about that , although the most docile of the doctor 's pupils , he refused to change his views concerning eternal punishment . During one of the last of Kennedy 's visits to him , he found several young men with Lord Byron , and among these M. S  --   --  , and M. F  --   --  . The former , seated at one corner of the table , was explaining to Count Gamba certain views which were any thing but orthodox . Lord Byron turned to the doctor , and said :  --  " Have you heard what S  --   --  said ? I assure you , he has not made one step toward conversion ; he is worse than I am . " M. F  --   --  having joined in the conversation , and said that there were many contradictions in the Scriptures , Byron replied :  --  " This is saying too much : I am a sufficiently good believer not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , upon reflection , be explained ; what most troubles me is eternal punishment : I am not prepared to believe in so terrible a dogma , and this is my only difference with the doctor 's views ; but he will not allow that I am an orthodox Christian , unless I agree with him in that matter . " This was said half-seriously , half-jestingly , but in so amiable a manner , and in a tone which was so free from mockery , that even the austere doctor was fain to forgive him for entertaining such erroneous views . When Byron left for Missolonghi , he carried away with him a real regard for Kennedy , notwithstanding their differences of opinion . Kennedy , on the other hand , had conceived for Byron the greatest liking , and , indeed , shows it in his book . His portrait of Lord Byron is so good , that we have thought it right to reproduce it , together with his general impressions in another chapter . Byron 's death plunged Kennedy into the deepest grief ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had with Lord Byron into one volume , which he published . But his friends , or so-called friends , showed themselves hostile to the publication . Some feared that he would exaggerate either Lord Byron 's faith or want of it , and others , less disinterested , apprehended the revelation of some of their own views , which might fail to meet with the approval of the public at home . When , therefore , Kennedy applied to several of these who were at Missolonghi to know in what religious frame of mind Byron died , he met with rebukes of all kinds , and his credit was attacked by articles in newspapers , endeavoring to show that Byron had all along been laughing at the doctor . All these attacks might have influenced Kennedy 's picture of Byron , but it will be seen that , with the exception of a few puritanical touches , the artist 's picture is not unworthy of the original . In the preface to his book , the doctor , not knowing whether he should make use of the conversation he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , the object of which was to be of use to the public , answers his own objections in the following words :  --  " If my doing so would injure his character or fame , there could not be a moment 's hesitation in deciding on the baseness of the measure . But , as far as I can judge , a true statement of what occurred will place his lordship 's character in a fairer light than he has himself done in many of his writings , or than can , perhaps , be done by a friendly biographer . The brightest parts of his life were those which he spent in Cephalonia and Missolonghi , and the fact of his wishing to hear Christianity explained by one , simply because he believed him to be sincere , confessing that he derived no happiness from his unsettled notions on religion , expressing a desire to be convinced , and his carrying with him religious books , and promising to give the subject a more attentive study than he had ever done , will throw a certain lustre over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deists of the right of quoting him as a cool , deliberate rejecter of Christianity . " To these very significant declarations , coming as they do from so conscientious a believer as Kennedy , I shall add the testimony of a few persons who have been conspicuous by their hostility to Byron . Mr. Galt is one of these , and yet he says :  --  " I am persuaded , nevertheless , that to class him among absolute infidels were to do injustice to his memory , and that he has suffered uncharitably in the opinion of the ' rigidly righteous , ' who , because he had not attached himself to any particular sect or congregation , assumed that he was an adversary to religion . To claim for him any credit as a pious man would be absurd ; but , to suppose he had not as deep an interest as other men ' in his soul 's health and welfare , ' was to impute to him a nature which can not exist . " And elsewhere , after showing , first , what Byron did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to believe , but which had not sufficient grounds to satisfy his reason ; thirdly , what he did actually believe , Mr. Galt adds :  --  " Whatever was the degree of Lord Byron 's dubiety as to points of faith and doctrine , he could not be accused of gross ignorance , nor described as animated by any hostile feeling against religion . " The same biographer says elsewhere :  --  " That Byron was deeply imbued with the essence of natural piety ; that he often felt the power and being of a God thrilling in all his frame , and glowing in his bosom , I declare my thorough persuasion ; and that he believed in some of the tenets and in the philosophy of Christianity , as they influence the spirit and conduct of men , I am as little disposed to doubt ; especially if those portions of his works which only trench upon the subject , and which bear the impression of fervor and earnestness , may be admitted as evidence . But he was not a member of any particular church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority , before his vanity was wounded by the publication of writings wherein his good faith was questioned , and it was shown that Lord Byron had no great esteem for his talents , says ,  --  " It is difficult to judge , from the contradictory nature of his writings , what the religious opinions of Lord Byron were . But on the whole , if he were occasionally skeptical , yet his wavering never amounted to a disbelief in the divine Founder of Christianity . ' I always took great delight , ' observed he , ' in the English Cathedral service . It can not fail to inspire every man who feels at all , with devotion . Notwithstanding which , Christianity is not the best source of inspiration for a poet . No poet should be tied down to a direct profession of faith . Metaphysics open a vast field . Nature and heterodoxy present to the poet 's imagination fertile sources from which Christianity forbids him to draw ; ' and he exemplified his meaning by a review of the works of Tasso and Milton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about Christianity , " he said to Shelley and me , ' that has made me very uncomfortable . The reasoning seems to me very strong , the proofs are very staggering . I do n't think you can answer it , Shelley ; at least , I am sure I ca n't , and , what is more , I do n't wish to do so . ' " Speaking of Gibbon , he says ,  --  " L  --   --  B  --   --  thought the question set at rest in the ' History of the Decline and Fall , ' but I am not so easily convinced . It is not a matter of volition to unbelieve . Who likes to own that he has been a fool all his life ,  --  to unlearn all that he has been taught in his youth ? Or can think that some of the best men that ever lived have been fools ? " And again ,  --  " You believe in Plato 's three principles , why not in the Trinity ? One is not more mystical than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enemy to religion , and an unbeliever . I disowned the other day that I was of Shelley 's school in metaphysics , though I admired his poetry . " " Although , " says Lord Harrington , " Byron was no Christian , he was a firm believer in the existence of a God . It is , therefore , equally remote from truth to represent him as either an atheist or a Christian . He was , as he has often told me , a confirmed Deist . " Further on , the same writer adds :  --  " Byron always maintained that he was a skeptic , but he was not so at all . During a ride at Cephalonia , which lasted two or three hours almost without a pause , he began to talk about ' Cain ' and his religious opinions , and he condemned all atheists , and maintained the principles of Deism . " Mr. Finlay , who used to see Lord Byron in Greece , says , in a letter to his friend Lord Harrington :  --  " Lord Byron liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once heard him openly profess to be a Deist . " These quotations are sufficiently numerous , and all point to the same conclusion , but I must quote the words of Gamba before I conclude this subject . He was , as it is known , the great friend of Byron , and alas ! sacrificed his noble self , at the age of twenty-four , to the cause of Greece . To Kennedy 's inquiries respecting Lord Byron 's religious tendencies at Missolonghi , P. Gamba replied as follows :  --  " My belief is that his religious opinions were not fixed . I mean , that he was not more inclined toward one than toward another of the Christian sects ; but that his feelings were thoroughly religious , and that he entertained the highest respect for the doctrines of Christ , which he considered to be the source of virtue and of goodness . As for the incomprehensible mysteries of religion , his mind floated in doubts which he wished most earnestly to dispel , as they oppressed him , and that is why he never avoided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aware . " I have often had an opportunity of observing him at times when the soul involuntarily expresses its most sincere convictions ; in the midst of dangers , both at sea and on land ; in the quiet contemplation of a calm and beautiful night , in the deepest solitude , etc. ; and I remarked that his thoughts always were imbued with a religious sentiment . The first time I ever had a conversation with him on that subject was at Ravenna , my native place , a little more than four years ago . We were riding together in a pine wood , on a beautiful spring day , and all was conducive to religious meditation . ' How , ' said he ' raising our eyes to heaven , or directing them to the earth , can we doubt of the existence of God ? Or how , turning them inward , can we doubt that there is something within us more noble and more durable than the clay of which we are formed ? Those who do not hear , or are unwilling to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . ' I answered him with all those reasons which the superficial philosophy of Helvetius , his disciples and his masters , have taught . He replied with very strong arguments and profound eloquence , and I perceived that obstinate contradiction on this subject , forcing him to reason upon it , gave him pain . This discourse made a deep impression on me . " Many times , and in various circumstances , I have heard him confirm the same sentiments , and he always seemed to me to be deeply convinced of their truth . Last year , at Genoa , when we were preparing for our journey to Greece , he used to converse with me alone for two or three hours every evening , seated on the terrace of his palace in Albano , in the fine evenings of spring , whence there opened a magnificent view of that superb city and the adjoining sea . Our conversation turned almost always on Greece , for which we were so soon to depart , or on religious subjects . In various ways I heard him confirm the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , then , ' said I to him , ' have you earned for yourself the name of impious , and enemy of all religious belief , from your writings ? ' He answered , ' They are not understood , and are wrongly interpreted by the malevolent . My object is only to combat hypocrisy , which I abhor in every thing , and particularly in religion , and which now unfortunately appears to me to be prevalent , ... and for this alone do those to whom you allude wish to render me odious , and make me out to be an impious person , and a monster of incredulity . ' " For the Bible he had always a particular respect . It was his custom to have it always on his study table , particularly during these last months ; and you well know how familiar it was to him , since he sometimes knew how to correct your inaccurate citations . " Fletcher may have informed you about his happy state of mind in his last moments . He often repeated subjects from the Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had in vain attempted to make known his wishes with respect to his daughter , and others most dear to him in life , and when , on account of the wanderings of his mind , he could not succeed in making himself understood , Fletcher answered him , ' Nothing is nearer my heart than to execute your wishes ; but , unfortunately , I have scarcely been able to comprehend half of them . ' ' Is it possible ? ' he replied . ' Alas ! it is too late . How unfortunate ! Not my will , but the will of God be done . ' There remained to him only a few intervals of reason and interruptions of delirium , the effect of determination of blood to the head . " He often expressed to me the contempt which he felt for those called esprits forts ( a set of ignorant egotists , incapable of any generous action , and hypocrites themselves ) , in their affected contempt of every faith . " He professed a complete toleration , and a particular respect for every sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detach any one persuaded of the truth from his belief , although it might be tinctured with absurdity , because he believed it could lead to no other end than to render him an infidel . " After so many proofs of Byron 's religious tendencies , is it not right to ask , What was that skepticism of which so much has been said that it has been almost received as a fact by the world generally ? Did he not believe in the necessity of religion ? In a God , Creator of all things ? In the spirituality , and therefore immortality , of the soul ? In our liberty of action , and our moral responsibility ? We have seen what others have said on each of these subjects ; let us now see what he said himself upon the subject . But some will object , " Are you going to judge of his views from his poetry ? Can one attach much importance to opinions expressed in verse ? Do not poets often say that which they do not think , but which genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered as their own views ? " Such objections may be valid , and we shall so far respect them , therefore , as to dismiss Lord Byron 's poetry , and treat only of that which he has written in prose : we will not consider him when under the influence of inspiration and of genius , but when given up entirely to the silent examination of his conscience . What did his thorough good sense tell him about religion in general ? The following note , in which he repels the stupid and wicked attacks of Southey , who called him a skeptic , will prove it :  --  " One mode of worship yields to another , but there never will be a country without a worship of some sort . Some will instance France ; but the Parisians alone , and a fanatical faction of them , maintained for a short time the absurd dogma of theophilanthropy . If the English Church is upset , it will be by the hands of its own sectaries , not by those of skeptics . People are too wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There may exist a few speculators without faith ; but they are small in numbers , and their opinions , being without enthusiasm or appeal to the passions , can not make proselytes unless they are persecuted , that being the only means of augmenting any sects . " " ' I am always , ' he writes in his memorandum , ' most religious upon a sunshiny day , as if there were some association , some internal approach to greater light and purity and the kindler of this dark lantern of our existence . " ' The night had also a religious influence , and even more so when I viewed the moon and stars through Herschel 's telescope , and saw that they were worlds . ' " And what thought Byron of the existence of God ? " Supposing even , " he says , " that man existed before God , even his higher pre-Adamite supposititious creation must have had an origin and a creator , for a creation is a more natural imagination than a fortuitous concourse of atoms ; all things remount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If , according to some speculations , you could prove the world many thousand years older than the Mosaic chronology , or if you could get rid of Adam and Eve , and the apple , and serpent , still what is to be set up in their stead ? or how is the difficulty removed ? Things must have had a beginning , and what matters it when or how ? " If Byron did not question the existence of God , did he doubt the spirituality and immortality of the soul ? Here are some of his answers :  --  " What is poetry ? " he asked himself in his memorandum , and he replied  --  " The feeling of a former world and future . " And further , in the same memorandum :  --  " Of the immortality of the soul , it appears to me that there can be little doubt , if we attend to the action of the mind for a moment : it is in perpetual activity . I used to doubt it , but reflection has taught me better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' a soul which draws a carcass '  --  a heavy chain , to be sure , but all chains , being material , may be shaken off . How far our future life will be individual , or , rather , how far it will at all resemble our present existence , is another question ; but that the mind is eternal , seems as probable as that the body is not so . Of course , I here venture upon the question without recurring to revelation , which , however , is at least as rational a solution of it as any other . A material resurrection seems strange and even absurd , except for purposes of punishment : and all punishment which is to revenge , rather than correct , must be morally wrong : and when the world is at an end , what moral or warning purpose can eternal tortures answer ? Human passions have probably disfigured the Divine doctrines here ; but the whole thing is inscrutable . " And again :  --  " I have often been inclined to materialism in philosophy ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me essentially founded upon the soul . For this reason , Priestley 's ' Christian Materialism ' always struck me as deadly . Believe the resurrection of the body , if you will , but not without a soul . The deuce is in it , if after having had a soul ( as , surely , the mind , or whatever you call it , is ) in this world , we must part with it in the next , even for an immortal materiality ; and I own my partiality for spirit . " It has already been seen that , in his early youth , he was intimately convinced of the immortality of his soul , by the fact of the existence of his conscience . But it is equally proved that , as his soul became more perfect , and rose more and more toward all that is great and virtuous , his conviction of the immortality of the soul became still more certain . The beautiful words which he addressed to Mr. Parry , a few hours before his agony , confirm our assertions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this subject , thank God , I am happy and at ease . The thought of living eternally , of again reviving , is a great pleasure . Christianity is the purest and most liberal religion in the world ; but the numerous teachers who are continually worrying mankind with their denunciations and their doctrines , are the greatest enemies of religion . I have read , with more attention than half of them , the Book of Christianity , and I admire the liberal and truly charitable principles which Christ has laid down . There are questions connected with this subject , which none but Almighty God can solve . Time and space , who can conceive ? None but God : on Him I rely . " If he neither questioned the existence of God nor the spirituality and immortality of the soul , did he question our liberty of thought , and hence our moral responsibility ? To put such a question , is to misunderstand Byron completely . Who , more than Byron , ever believed in our right of judgment , and proclaimed that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verse ? Let any one who has read " Manfred , " say whether a poet ever developed such Christian and philosophical views with greater energy and power . Did Lord Byron really question , in his poems , the infinite goodness of God , as he has been accused of doing ? Did his doubts and perplexities of mind , caused by the terrible knowledge of the existence of evil , ever go beyond the limits of the doubts which beset the minds of intellectual men , when the light of faith fails to aid them in their philosophical researches after truth ? When he published his drama , " Cain , a Mystery , " he was attacked by enemies in the most violent manner . They selected the arguments put into the mouth of Lucifer , and their influence upon Cain , to prove that this biblical poem was a blasphemous composition , and that its author was consequently deserving of being outlawed , as having attempted to question the supreme wisdom of God . But most certainly Lucifer speaks in the poem as Lucifer should speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a theologian , and the first assassin as a meek orthodox Christian ? Byron gave them each the language logically most suited to their respective characters , as Milton did , without , however , incurring the accusation of impiety . It was argued that Byron ought , at least , to have introduced some one charged with the defense of the right doctrines . But was not the drama entitled a Mystery , and was not the title to be justified , as it were ? Could he have done otherwise , even if he had wished it ever so much ? What could Adam , or even God 's angel , do better than remain silent in presence of the mental agony of Cain , and only advise his bowing to the incomprehensibility of the mystery ? Again , if discussion was fruitful of results with Abel , must it be the same with Cain ? Was Lord Byron to turn both these personages into theologians , ready to discuss any and every metaphysical question , and to explain the origin and effects of evil ? Had they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have succeeded in persuading Cain of the solidity of their argument , or in dispelling the clouds which obscured his mind , and both calm his despair and satisfy so inquisitive a nature , influenced and mastered , as it was , by evil passions . If Lord Byron thought he could explain the existence of evil , he would not have entitled his poem " a Mystery . " But , above all , Lord Byron did not wish to outstep the limits of reason to prove still more how powerless is reason , alone and unaided , in its endeavors to conciliate contradictory attributes . The drama was called a Mystery , and Byron wished it to remain such . Were some of his biographers right in asserting that he had adopted Cuvier 's system ? But Cuvier never denied the existence of the Creator , as Moore seems to believe . On the contrary , he endeavored to show , even more forcibly , the admirable work of the Creation , in order to bring out still more in relief the perfection of its Creator . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of evil to be so great an injustice to the infinite goodness of God , and expressed in his memorandum the opinion " that history and experience show that good and evil are counterbalanced on earth . " " Were I to begin life again , " he said , in the same memorandum , " I do n't think I would change any thing in mine . " A proof that , without understanding why or wherefore , he felt our life on earth to be but the beginning of one which is to be continued in another sphere , under the rule of Him whose gentle hand can be traced in all things created . For the same reason he was reconciled to the injustice of mankind , believing this life to be a trial , and bearing it with noble courage and fortitude . This mental resignation , however , did not prevent his suffering bitterly in a moral sense . All pleasure became a pain to him at the sight of the sufferings of others . He declared on one occasion , at Cephalonia , that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be saved , he would prefer being damned with the rest . This excess of generosity may have appeared eccentric , but can scarcely seem too exaggerated to those who knew him . Certain it is , that to witness the sufferings of others with resignation , appeared to him to be egotism , and to evince a coldheartedness , which would have been unpardonable in his eyes . Sometimes even the energy of his writings , dictated , as they were , by his great generosity of heart , appeared as the revolt of a noble nature against the miseries of humanity . In such a frame of mind was he when he wrote " Cain , " at Ravenna , in the midst of people who were for the most part unjustly proscribed , and in the midst of sufferings which he always tried to alleviate . Did he deserve the appellation of skeptic , because he despised that vain philosophy which believes it can explain all things , even God 's nature itself , by the sole force of reason ? or because , while respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preferred to follow the principles of a philosophy that argues with diffidence , and humbly owns its inability to explain all things , and which caused him to exclaim in " Don Juan "  --  " For me , I know naught ; nothing I deny , Admit , reject , contemn : and what know you , Except , perhaps , that you were born to die ? " But to whom were these lines addressed ? To those metaphysicians , of course , whom he would also have denominated " men who know nothing , but who , among the truths which they ignore , ignore their own ignorance most , "  --  to those arrogant minds who wish to fathom even the ways which God has kept back from us , and who , in seeking to know the wherefore of all things in creation , are forced to give the name of explanation to mere comparisons . Byron says , in " Don Juan , "  --  " Explain me your explanation . " He addressed himself finally , to all hypocrites and intolerant men ; Byron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincere and orthodox Catholic , who holds that the negation of a dogma constitutes skepticism , should have called Byron a skeptic because he questioned the doctrine of eternal punishment , is not to be wondered at ; but what is matter of astonishment is , that the reproach was addressed to him by the writer of " Faust , " and by the writer of " Elvire , " and the " Meditations . " Yet it is so ; and if this psychological problem is not yet solved , let others do it ,  --  we can not . To sum up , we may declare , from what we have said , that as regards Lord Byron there has been a confusion of words , and that his skepticism has merely been a natural and inevitable situation in which certain minds who , as it were , are the victims of their own contradictory thoughts , are placed , notwithstanding their wish to believe . Faith , being a part of poetical feeling , could not but form a part likewise of Byron 's nature , but there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merits of the opinions of others , and consequently the desire not to arrive too hastily at conclusions . This combination of instinctive faith and a philosophical mind could not produce in him the belief in those things which did not appear to him to have been first submitted to the test of argument , and proved to be just by the convictions resulting from the test of reasoning to which they had been subjected . It produced , on the contrary , a species of expectant doubt , a state of mind awaiting some decisive explanation , to reject error and embrace the truth . His skepticism , therefore , may be said to have been the result of thought , not of passion . In religion , however , it must be allowed that his skepticism never went so far as to cause him to deny its fundamental doctrines . These he proclaimed from heartfelt convictions , and his modest , humble , and manly skepticism may be said to have been that of great minds , and his failings , also , theirs . Is a day said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rays of the sun ? Is it necessary to say any thing about what he doubted ? In showing what he believed , the exception will be found unnecessary . He believed in a Creator , in a spiritual and consequently immortal soul , but which God can reduce to nothing , as He created it out of nothing . He believed in liberty of thought , in our responsibility , our privileges , our duties , and especially in the obligation of practicing the great precept which constitutes Christianity ; namely , that of charity and devotion toward our neighbor , even to the sacrifice of our existence for his sake . He believed in every virtue , but his experience forbade his according faith to appearances , and trusting in fine phrases . He often found it wise and prudent to scrutinize the idol he was called upon to worship , but when once that idol had borne the test of scrutiny no worship was so sincere . " Was he orthodox ? " will again be asked . To such a question it may be justly answered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed by the Scriptures that faith which he was called upon to possess , it was not for want of desiring so powerful an auxiliary to his reason . He felt that , however strong reason might be , it always retains a little wavering and anxious character ; and , though essentially religious at heart , he could not master that blind faith required in matters which baffle the efforts of reason to prove their truth logically and definitively . This is to be accounted for by the conflict of his conscience and his philosophical turn of mind . Conviction , for him , was a difficult thing to attain . Hence for him the difficulty of saying " I believe , " and hence the accusation of skepticism to which he became liable . He wanted proofs of a decisive character , and his doubts belonged to that school which made Bacon confess that a philosopher who can doubt , knows more than all the wise men together . Byron would never have contested absolutely the truth of any mystery , but have merely stated that , as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such a mystery must be liable to be questioned . He was wont to add , however , that the mysteries of religion did not appear to him less comprehensible than those of science and of reason . As for miracles , how could he think them absurd and impossible , since he admitted the omnipotence of God ? His mind was far too just not to understand that miracles surround us , even from the first origin of our race . He often asked himself , whether the first man could ever have been created a child ? " Reason , " says a great Christian philosopher , " does not require the aid of the Book of Genesis to believe in that miracle . " One evening at Pisa , in the drawing-room of the Countess G  --   --  , where Byron was wont to spend all his evenings , a great discussion arose respecting a certain miracle which was said to have taken place at Lucca . The miracle had been accompanied by several rather ludicrous circumstances , and of course laughter was not spared . Shelley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miracles as deplorable superstitions . Lord Byron laughed at the absurdity of the history told , without any malice however . Madame G  --   --  alone did not laugh . " Do you , then , believe in that miracle ? " asked Byron . " I do not say I exactly believe in that miracle , " she replied ; " but I believe in miracles , since I believe in God and in His omnipotence ; nor could I believe that God can be deprived of His liberty , when I feel that I have mine . Were I no longer to believe in miracles , it seems to me I should no longer believe in God , and that I should lose my faith . " Lord Byron stopped joking , and said  --  " Well , after all , the philosophy of common sense is the truest and the best . " The conversation continued , in the jesting tone in which it had begun , and M. M  --   --  , an esprit fort , went so far as to condemn the supernatural in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to look upon miracles as the legends of a by-gone age , and as errors which affect the ignorant . From what had gone before , he probably fancied that Byron was going to join issue with him . But there was often a wide gulf between the intimate thoughts of Byron and his expressions of them . " We allow ourselves too often , " he said , " to give way to a jocular mood , and to laugh at everything , probably because God has granted us this faculty to compensate for the difficulty which we find in believing , in the same manner as playthings are given to children . But I really do not see why God should be obliged to preserve in the universe the same order which He once established . To whom did He promise that He would never change it , either wholly or in part ? Who knows whether some day He will not give the moon an oval or a square shape instead of a round one ? " This he said smiling , but added immediately after , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a God , Creator of the universe , can not refuse their belief in the possibility of miracles , for they behold in God the first of all miracles . " Finally , Lord Byron determined himself the limits of what he deemed his necessary belief ; and remained throughout life a stanch supporter of those opinions , but he never ceased to evince a tendency to steer clear of intolerance , which according to him only brought one back to total unbelief . Let us not omit to add that , as he grew older , he saw better the arrogant weakness of those who screen themselves under the cover of science , and recognized more clearly each day the hand of the Creator in the works of nature . " Did Lord Byron pray ? " is another objection which will be made . We have already seen what he thought of prayer ; we have shown that his poems often took the form of a prayer , and we have read with admiration various passages containing some most sublime lines which completely answer those who accused him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his soul toward God . We also know with what feelings of respect he approached places devoted to a religious life , and what charms he found in the ceremonies of the Church . All this is proof enough , it would seem ; but , in any case , we must add that if his prayers were not those advised by Kennedy , they were at least the prayers of a great soul which soars upward to bow before its Creator . " Outward ceremonies , " says Fenelon , " are only tokens of that essential point , the religion of the soul , and Byron 's prayer was rather a thanksgiving than a request . "  --  " In the eyes of God , " says some one , " a good action is worth more than a prayer . " Such was his mode of communing with God even in his early youth , but especially in his last moments , which were so sublime . Can one doubt , that at that solemn moment his greatest desire was to be allowed to live ? He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His harvest was only just beginning to ripen . By dint of heroism , he was at last becoming known . He was young , scarcely thirty-six years of age , handsome , rich . Rank and genius were his . He was beloved by many , notwithstanding a host of jealous rivals ; and yet , on the point of losing all these advantages , what was his prayer ? Was it egotistical or presumptuous ? was it to solicit a miracle in his favor ? No , his last words were those of noble resignation . " Let Thy holy will , my God , be done , and not mine ! " and then absorbed , as it were , in the infinity of God 's goodness , and , confiding entirely in God 's mercy , he begged that he might be left alone to sleep quietly and peacefully into eternity . On the very day which brought to us the hope of our immortality , he would awake in the bosom of God . FOOTNOTES : Footnote 17 : Sympathy . Footnote 18 : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 : Article on his Life in Italy and at Pisa . CHAPTER V. CHILDHOOD AND YOUTH OF LORD BYRON . All Byron 's biographers ( at least all those who knew him ) have borne testimony to his great goodness , but they have not dwelt sufficiently upon this principal feature in his character . Biographers generally wish to produce an effect . But goodness is not a sufficiently noticeable quality to be dilated upon ; it would not repay ambition or curiosity . It is a quality mostly attributed to the saints , and a biographer prefers dilating upon the defects of his hero , upon some adventure or scandal  --  means by which it is easy , with a spark of cleverness , to make a monster of a saint : for , alas ! the most rooted convictions are often sacrificed for the sake of amusing a reader who is difficult to please , and of satisfying an editor . Lord Byron 's goodness , however , was so exceptional , and contrasted so strongly with the qualities attributed to him by those who only knew him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , astonishment , at the very least , might have been the result . If we look at him conscientiously in every act of his life , in his letters , and in his poetry , we must sympathize particularly with him . We find that his goodness shines as prominently as does his genius , and we feel that it can bear any test at any epoch of , alas ! his too short existence . As , however , I do not purpose here to write his biography , I shall confine myself merely to a few instances , and will give only a few proofs taken from his early life . To no one can the words of Alfieri be better applied than to Byron :  --  " He is the continuation of the child "  --  an idea which has been expressed even more elegantly of late by Disraeli , in his " Literary Characters : "  --  " As the sun is seen best at its rising and its setting , so men 's native dispositions are clearly perceived while they are children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of those who have written Byron 's life , the best disposed among them have not sufficiently noticed his admirable perfection of character when a child , as revealed to us by sundry anecdotes and by his own poems , entitled " Hours of Idleness : "  --  " There was in his disposition , " says Moore , " as appears from the concurrent testimony of nurses , tutors , and all who were employed about him , a mixture of affectionate sweetness and playfulness , by which it was impossible not to be attached , and which rendered him then , as in his riper years , easily manageable by those who loved and understood him sufficiently to be at once gentle and firm enough for the task . The female attendant whom he had taken the most fancy to was the youngest of two sisters , named Mary Gray , and she had succeeded in gaining an influence over his mind against which he very rarely rebelled . " By an accident which occurred at the time of his birth one of his feet was twisted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limb to shape , expedients were used under the direction of the celebrated Dr. Hunter . Mary Gray , to whom fell the task of putting on the bandages at bed-time , used to sing him to sleep , or tell him Scotch ballads and legends , in which he delighted , or teach him psalms , and thus lighten his pain . Mary Gray was a very pious woman , and she unquestionably inspired Byron with that love of the Scriptures which he preserved to his last day . She only parted from Byron when he was placed at school at Dulwich , in 1800 . The child loved her as she loved him . He gave her his watch , and , later , sent her his portrait . Both these treasures were given to Dr. Ewing ( an enthusiast of Byron , who had collected the dying words of Mary Gray , which were all for the child she had nursed ) , by her grateful husband . The same gratitude was shown by Byron to Mary Gray 's sister , who had been his first nursery governess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to ask news of her , and to announce with delight that he could now put on an ordinary shoe  --  an event , he said , which he had greatly looked forward to , and which he was sure it would give her pleasure to hear . Before going to school at Aberdeen , Byron had two tutors , Ross and Paterson , both young , intelligent , and amiable ecclesiastics , for whom he always entertained a pleasing and affectionate remembrance . At seven years of age he went to the Aberdeen Grammar School , and the general impression which he left there , as evinced by the testimony of several of his colleagues who are still living , was , says Moore , " that he was quick , courageous , passionate , to a remarkable degree venturous and fearless , but affectionate and companionable . " He was most anxious to distinguish himself among his school-fellows by prowess in all sports and exercises , but , though quick when he could be persuaded to attend , he was in general very low in his class , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anecdotes told of him at this time all prove his fine nature , and show the goodness and greatness of soul which characterized him up to his last day . All the qualities which are to shine in the man will be found already marked in the child . On one occasion he was taken to see a piece at the Edinburgh theatre , in which one of the actors pretends that the moon is the sun . The child , notwithstanding his timidity , was shocked by this insult to his understanding , rose from his seat , and cried out , " I assure you , my dear sir , that it is the moon . " Here , again , we can trace that love of truth which in after life made him so courageous in its proclamation at any cost . When , at Aberdeen , he was , on one occasion , styled Dominus Byron in the school-room , by way of announcing to him his accession to the title , the child began to cry . Can not these tears be explained by the mixture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment  --  pleasure at becoming a peer , and distress at not being able to share this pleasure with his comrades ? Are they not a prelude of the sacrifice of himself which he afterward made by actually placing himself in the wrong , in order that at the time of his greatest triumph his rivals might not be too jealous of him ? On one occasion , as he was riding with a friend , they arrived at the bridge of Balgounie , on the river Dee , and , remembering suddenly the old ballad which threatens with death the man who passes the bridge first on a pony , Byron stopped his comrade , and requested to be allowed to pass first ; because if the ballad said true , and that one of them must die , it was better , said he , that it should be him , rather than his friend , because he had only a mother to mourn his loss , whereas his friend had a father and a mother , and the pain of his death would fall upon two persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generosity of character of which Byron 's life offers so many instances . On another occasion he saw a poor woman coming out of a bookseller 's shop , distressed and mortified at not having enough to buy herself the Bible she wanted . The child ran after her , brought her back , made her a present of the desired book , and , in doing so , obeyed that same craving of the heart to do good which placed him all his life at the service of others . These instances will suffice at present . On his accession to the title , as heir to his great uncle , he left Scotland , and was taken to see Newstead Abbey , his future residence . He spent the winter at Nottingham , the most important of the towns round Newstead . His mother , who was blindly fond of him , could not bear to see any physical defect in him , however slight . She confided him to a quack doctor named Lavender , who promised to cure him , while his studies were continued under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to undergo being both painful and tedious , furnishes us with the opportunity of admiring his strength of mind . Mr. Rogers , who had conceived a great liking for the child , noticed on one occasion that he was suffering . " Pray do not notice it , " said Byron , " you will see that I shall behave in such a way that you will not perceive it . " Notwithstanding his own want of skill , Mr. Lavender might , perhaps , have cured the child . But Byron , who had no faith in him , always found fault with every thing he did , and played tricks upon him . At last his mother agreed with Lord Carlisle , who was his guardian , to take him to London , to be better educated and taken care of . He was sent to Mr. Glennie 's school at Dulwich , and his foot was to be attended to by the famous Dr. Baillie . For the first time , then , did Byron leave the home where he had been rather spoiled than neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , made him sleep in his own study , and watched with an equal care the progress of his studies and the cure of his foot . This latter task was no easy one , owing to the restlessness of the child , who would join in all the gymnastic exercises suitable to his age , whereas absolute repose was prescribed for him . Dr. Glennie says , however , that , once back in the study-room , Byron 's docility was equal to his vivacity . He had been instructed according to the mode of teaching adopted at Aberdeen , and had to retrace his steps , owing to the difference of teaching prescribed in English schools . " I found him enter upon his tasks , " says Dr. Glennie , " with alacrity and success . He was playful , good-humored , and beloved by his companions . His reading in history and poetry was far beyond the usual standard of his age , and in my study he found , among other works , a set of our poets  --  from Chaucer to Churchill  --  which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than once perused from beginning to end . He showed at this age an intimate acquaintance with the historical parts of the Holy Scriptures , upon which he seemed delighted to converse with me , and reasoned upon the facts contained in the sacred volume with every appearance of belief in the divine truths which they unfold . That the impressions thus imbibed in his boyhood had , notwithstanding the irregularities of his after life , sunk deep into his mind , will appear , I think , to every impartial reader of his works , and I never have been able to divest myself of the persuasion , that he must have found it difficult to violate the better principles early instilled into him . " He remained two years with Dr. Glennie , during which time he does not appear to have made great progress in his studies , owing to the too frequent amusements procured for him by his over-fond mother . But though Mr. and Mrs. Glennie saw the child very seldom after he left them , they always remained much attached to him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine qualities which they had loved and admired in him as a child . At thirteen years old he went to Harrow , the head master of which school was Dr. Drury , who at once conceived a great fancy for the boy , and remained attached to him all his life . He thus expresses himself with regard to Byron :  --  " A degree of shyness hung about him for some time . His manner and temper soon convinced me that he might be led by a silken string , rather than by a cable . On that principle I acted . " To Lord Carlisle 's inquiries about Byron , Drury replied :  --  " He has talents , my lord , which will add lustre to his rank . " After having been his master he remained his friend , and shortly before his death , Byron declared that , of all the masters and friends he ever had , the best was Dr. Drury , for whom he should entertain as much regard as he would have done for his own father . Now that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that we have seen them all , without exception , beloved by the child as they loved him , we must take a glance at his college life , and see how he came to possess such charms of manner and of character . In the youth will appear those great qualities which began in the child , and will shine in the man . On one occasion he prevented his comrades from setting fire to the school , by appealing to their filial love , and pointing to the names of their parents on the walls which they wished to destroy . He thus saved the school . " When Lord Byron and Mr. Peel were at Harrow together , " says Moore , " a tyrant some few years older , whose name was N  --   --  , claimed a right to fag little Peel , which claim Peel resisted . His resistance was vain , and N  --   --  not only subdued him , but determined also to punish the refractory slave by inflicting a bastinado on the inner fleshy side of the boy 's right arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor Peel was writhing under them , Byron saw and felt for the misery of his friend ; and , although he knew he was not strong enough to fight N  --   - -  with any hope of success , and that it was dangerous even to approach him , he advanced to the scene of action , and , with a flush of rage , tears in his eyes , and a voice trembling between terror and indignation , asked very humbly if N  --   --  would be pleased to tell him how many stripes he meant to inflict ? ' Why , ' returned the executioner , ' you little rascal , what is that to you ? ' ' Because , if you please , ' said Byron , holding out his arm , ' I would take half . ' There is a mixture of simplicity and magnanimity in this little trait which is truly heroic . " At fifteen Byron was still at Harrow . A certain Mr. Peel ordered his fag , Lord Gort , to make him some toast for tea . The little fag did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red-hot iron applied to the palm of his hand . The child cried , and the masters requested that he should name the author of such cruelty . He did not , however , as the expulsion of Peel might have resulted from the avowal . Byron , highly pleased with this courageous act , went up to Lord Gort and said , " You are a brave fellow , and , if you like it , I shall take you as my fag , and you will not have to suffer any more ill-treatment . " " I became his fag , " says Lord Gort , " and was very fortunate in obtaining so good a master , and one who constantly gave me presents as he did . " When he gave dinners he always recommended his fag to partake of all the delicacies which he had ordered for his guests . " At all times Byron 's greatest pleasure was to make people happy , and his conduct to his fags showed the kind heart with which through life he acted toward his subordinates . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How much he loved him can be seen in the beautiful lines which he addressed to the duke on leaving Harrow , and which reveal his noble heart :  --  TO THE DUKE OF DORSET . Dorset ! whose early steps with mine have stray 'd , Exploring every path of Ida 's glade ; Whom still affection taught me to defend , And made me less a tyrant than a friend , Though the harsh custom of our youthful band Bade thee obey , and gave me to command ; Thee , on whose head a few short years will shower The gift of riches and the pride of power ; E'en now a name illustrious is thine own , Renown 'd in rank , nor far beneath the throne . Yet , Dorset , let not this seduce thy soul To shun fair science , or evade control , Though passive tutors , fearful to dispraise The titled child , whose future breath may raise , View ducal errors with indulgent eyes , And wink at faults they tremble to chastise .

It was especially at Harrow that Byron contracted those friendships which were like cravings of his heart , and which , although partaking of a passionate character , had nevertheless none of the instability which is the characteristic of passion . The death of some of his friends , and the coldness of others , caused him the greatest grief , and broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misanthropy discernible in some of his poems , though contrary to his real character . For those , on the other hand , who were spared , and remained faithful to him , Byron preserved through life the warmest affection and the tenderest regard ; the principal feature of his nature being the unchanging character of his sentiments . Although he showed at an early age his disposition to a poetical turn of mind , by the force of his feelings and by his meditative wanderings  --  in Scotland among the mountains and on the sea-shore at Cheltenham ;  --  by his rapturous admiration of the setting sun , as well as by the delight which he took in the legends told him by his nurses , and the emotions which he experienced to a degree which made him lose all appetite , all rest , and all peace of mind ; yet no one would have believed at that time that a gigantic poetical genius lay dormant in so active a nature . Soon , however , did his soul light up his intelligence , and obliged him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From that moment his genius spread its roots in his heart , and Harrow became his paradise owing to the affection which he met with there . It was at Harrow that he wrote , between his fourteenth and eighteenth year , the " Hours of Idleness , by a Minor , " of which he had printed at the request of his friends , a few copies for private circulation only . These modest poems did not , however , escape the brutal attacks of critics . Mackenzie , however , a man of talent himself , soon discovered that at the bottom of these poems there lay the roots of a great poetical genius . The " Hours of Idleness " are a treasure of intellectual and psychological gleanings . They showed man as God created him , and before his noble soul , depressed by the insolence of his enemies and the troubles of life , endeavored to escape the eyes of the world , or at least of those who could not or would not understand him . The noblest instincts of human nature shine so conspicuously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God that he created such a noble mind , while we feel indignant toward those who could not appreciate it . But to understand him better he must reveal himself , and we shall therefore quote a few of his own sayings as a boy . His first grief brought forth his first poem . A young cousin of his died , and of her death he spoke to this effect in his memorandum :  --  " My first recourse to poetry was due to my passion for my cousin Margaret Parker . She was , without doubt , one of the most beautiful and ethereal beings I ever knew . I have forgotten the lines , but never shall I forget her . I was twelve years of age , and she was older than myself by nearly a year . I loved her so passionately , that I could neither sleep , nor get rest , or eat when thinking of her . She died of consumption , and it was at Harrow that I heard both of her illness and of her death . " Then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizes as " very dull ; " but it is interesting as his first poetical essay , and as the first cry of pain uttered by a child who vents his grief in verse , and reveals in it the goodness of his heart and the power of his great mind . On a calm and dark night he goes to her tomb and strews it with flowers ; then , speaking of her virtues , exclaims :  --  " But wherefore weep ? Her matchless spirit soars Beyond where splendid shines the orb of day ; And weeping angels lead her to those bowers Where endless pleasures virtue 's deeds repay . " And shall presumptuous mortals Heaven arraign , And , madly , godlike Providence accuse ? Ah , no ! far fly from me attempts so vain ;  - -  I 'll ne'er submission to my God refuse . " Yet is remembrance of those virtues dear , Yet fresh the memory of that beauteous face , Still they call forth my warm affection 's tear , Still in my heart retain their wonted place . " 1802 . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals itself more and more in each poem of this first collection ; and on this account , rather than because of its poetical merits , are the " Hours of Idleness " interesting to the psychological biographer of Byron . " Whoever , " says Sainte-Beuve , " has not watched a youthful talent at its outset , will never form for himself a perfect and really true appreciation of it . " Moore adds : " It is but justice to remark that the early verses of Lord Byron give but little promise of those dazzling miracles of poesy with which he afterward astonished and enchanted the world , however distinguished they are by tenderness and grace . " There is , indeed , one point of view in which these productions are deeply and intrinsically interesting ; as faithful reflections of his character at that period of life , they enable us to judge of what he was before any influences were brought to bear upon him , and so in them we find him pictured exactly such as each anecdote of his boyish days exhibits him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or injustice , but still more so in the cause of others than in his own ; and yet , with all this vehemence , docile and placable at the least touch of a hand authorized by love to guide him . The affectionateness , indeed , of his disposition , traceable as it is through every page of this volume , is yet but faintly done justice to even by himself ; his whole youth being from earliest childhood a series of the most passionate attachments , of those overflowings of the soul , both in friendship and love , which are still more rarely responded to than felt , and which , when checked or sent back upon the heart , are sure to turn into bitterness . " While his soul expanded with the first rays of love which dawned upon it , friendship too began to assert its influence over him . But in continuing to observe in him the effects of incipient love , let us remark that , while such precocious impressions are only with others the natural development of physical instincts , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul that expands , of an amiability , of a tenderness ever on the increase . Though sensible to physical beauty as he always was through life , his principal attraction , however , was in that beauty which expresses the beauty of the soul , without which condition no physical perfection commanded his attention . We have seen what an ethereal creature Miss Margaret Parker was . Miss Chaworth succeeded her in Byron 's affections , and was his second , if not third love if we notice his youthful passion at nine years of age for Mary Duff . But his third love was the occasion of great pain to him . Miss Chaworth was heiress to the grounds and property of Annesley , which were in the immediate neighborhood of Newstead . Notwithstanding , however , the enmity which had existed between the two families for a long time , on account of a duel which had resulted in the death of Miss Chaworth 's grandfather , Byron was received most cordially at Annesley . Mrs. Chaworth thought that a marriage between her daughter and Byron might perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existed between their respective families . Byron therefore found his school-boy advances encouraged by both mother and daughter , and his imagination naturally was kindled . The result was that Byron fell desperately in love with Miss Chaworth ; but he was only fifteen years old , and yet an awkward schoolboy , with none of that splendid and attractive beauty for which he was afterward distinguished . Miss Chaworth was three years older , and unfortunately her heart was already engaged to the man who , to her misfortune , she married the year after . She therefore looked upon Byron as a mere child , as a younger brother , and his love almost amused her . She , however , not only gave him a ring , her portrait , and some of her hair , but actually carried on a secret correspondence with him . These were the faults for which she afterward had to suffer so bitterly . Such a union , however , with so great a difference of age , would not have been natural . It could only be a dream ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had its effect upon Byron , in order to show the beauty of his soul under another aspect . I can only add here that he had attributed every virtue to this girl whom he afterward styled frivolous and deceitful . On his return to Harrow this love and his passionate friendships divided his heart . But when the following vacation came , his dream vanished . Miss Chaworth was engaged to another , and on his return to Harrow he vainly tried to forget her who had deceived and wounded him . Like other young men , he devoted his time during the Harrow or Cambridge vacations to paying his respects and offering his regards to numerous belles , whose names appear variously in his poems as Emma , Caroline , Helen , and Mary . Moore believes them to have been imaginary loves . A slight acquaintance with the liberty enjoyed by young men at English universities would lead one to believe these loves to have been any thing but unreal . This can be the more readily believed , as Byron always sought in reality the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly support , though the slightest , as Moore observes , in speaking of the charming lines with which his love for Miss Chaworth inspired him , at the time when the recollection of it made him compare his misfortune in marrying Miss Milbank , with the happier lot which might have been his had he married Miss Chaworth . Whether these loves were real or not , however , it must be borne in mind that Byron deemed all physical beauty to be nothing if unaccompanied by moral beauty . Thus , in speaking of a vain young girl , he exclaims :  --  " One who is thus from nature vain , I pity , but I can not love . " And to Miss N. N  --   --  , who was exquisitely beautiful , but in whose eyes earthly passion shone too powerfully , he says :  --  " Oh , did those eyes , instead of fire , With bright but mild affection shine , Though they might kindle less desire , Love , more than mortal , would be thine . For thou art form 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We must admire , but still despair ; That fatal glance forbids esteem . " In a letter to Miss Pigott , which he wrote from Cambridge , he says :  --  " Saw a girl at St. Mary 's the image of Ann  --   --  ; thought it was her  --  all in the wrong  --  the lady stared , so did I  --  I blushed , so did not the lady  --  sad thing  --  wish women had more modesty . " On awaking from his dream , and on finding that the jewels with which he had believed Mary 's nature to be adorned were of his own creation , he sought his consolation in friendship . His heart , which was essentially a loving one , could not be consoled except by love , and Harrow , to use his own expressions , became a paradise to him . In tracing the picture of Tasso 's infancy he has drawn a picture of himself :  --  " From my very birth My soul was drunk with love , which did pervade And mingle with whate'er I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and out of wild and lonely flowers , And rocks , whereby they grew , a paradise Where I did lay me down within the shade Of waving trees , and dreamed uncounted hours , Though I was chid for wandering .... " This sentiment of friendship , which is always more powerful in England than on the Continent , owing to the system of education which takes children away from their parents at an early age , was keenly developed in Byron , whose affectionate disposition wanted something to make up for the privation of a father 's and a brother 's love . In his pure and passionate heart friendship and love became mixed : his love partook of the purity of friendship , and his friendships of all the ardor of love . But to return to his fourteenth year . While expressing in verse his love for his cousin , he expressed at the same time in poetry the strong friendship he had conceived , even before going to Harrow , for a boy who had been his companion . This boy , who had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the son of one of his tenants at Newstead . Aristocratic prejudices ran high in England , and this friendship of Byron for a commoner was sure to call forth the raillery of some of his companions . Notwithstanding this , Byron , at twelve years and a half old , replied in these terms to the mockery of others :  --  To E  --   --  . Let Folly smile to view the names Of thee and me in friendship twined ; Yet Virtue will have greater claims To love , than rank with vice combined . And though unequal is thy fate , Since title deck 'd my higher birth ! Yet envy not this gaudy state ; Thine is the pride of modest worth . Our souls at least congenial meet , Nor can thy lot my rank disgrace ; Our intercourse is not less sweet , Since worth of rank supplies the place . What noble views in a child of twelve ! How well one feels that , whatever may be his fate , such a nature will never lose its independence , nor allow prejudice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that its device will always be , " Fais ce que dois , advienne que pourra . " " I do what I ought , come what may . " At thirteen he wrote some lines in which he seemed to have a kind of presentiment of the glory that awaited him , and , at any rate , in which he displayed his resolve to deserve it :  --  A FRAGMENT . When to their airy hall , my fathers ' voice Shall call my spirit , joyful in their choice ; When , poised upon the gale , my form shall ride , Or , dark in mist , descend the mountain 's side ; Oh ! may my shade behold no sculptured urns To mark the spot where earth to earth returns ! No lengthen 'd scroll , no praise-encumber 'd stone ; My epitaph shall be my name alone : If that with honor fail to crown my clay , Oh ! may no other fame my deeds repay ! That , only that , shall single out the spot ; By that remember 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a visit to Newstead inspired him with the following beautiful lines :  --  ON LEAVING NEWSTEAD ABBEY . " Why dost thou build the hall , son of the winged days ? Thou lookest from thy tower to-day ; yet a few years , and the blast of the desert comes , it howls in thy empty court . "  --  OSSIAN . Through thy battlements , Newstead , the hollow winds whistle ; Thou , the hall of my fathers , art gone to decay : In thy once smiling garden , the hemlock and thistle Have choked up the rose which late bloom 'd in the way . Of the mail-cover 'd Barons , who proudly to battle Led their vassals from Europe to Palestine 's plain , The escutcheon and shield , which with every blast rattle , Are the only sad vestiges now that remain . No more doth old Robert , with harp-stringing numbers , Raise a flame in the breast for the war-laurell 'd wreath ; Near Askalon 's towers John of Horistan slumbers , Unnerved is the hand of his minstrel by death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley of Cressy ; For the safety of Edward and England they fell : My fathers ! the tears of your country redress ye ; How you fought , how you died , still her annals can tell . On Marston , with Rupert , ' gainst traitors contending , 21 Four brothers enrich 'd with their blood the bleak field ; For the rights of a monarch their country defending , Till death their attachment to royalty seal 'd . Shades of heroes , farewell ! your descendant departing From the seat of his ancestors , bids you adieu !

Though a tear dim his eye at this sad separation , ' T is nature , not fear , that excites his regret ; Far distant he goes , with the same emulation , The fame of his fathers he ne'er can forget .

" Greek : Aster prin men elampes eni zooisin heoos. "  --  LAERTIUS . Oh , Friend ! forever loved , forever dear ! What fruitless tears have bathed thy honor 'd bier ! What sighs re-echo 'd to thy parting breath , While thou wast struggling in the pangs of death ! Could tears retard the tyrant in his course ; Could sighs avert his dart 's relentless force ; Could youth and virtue claim a short delay , Or beauty charm the spectre from his prey ; Thou still hadst lived to bless my aching sight , Thy comrade 's honor and thy friend 's delight . If yet thy gentle spirit hover nigh The spot where now thy mouldering ashes lie , Here wilt thou read , recorded on my heart , A grief too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marks thy couch of lowly sleep , But living statues there are seen to weep ; Affliction 's semblance bends not o'er thy tomb , Affliction 's self deplores thy youthful doom . What though thy sire lament his failing line , A father 's sorrows can not equal mine ! Though none , like thee , his dying hour will cheer , Yet other offspring soothe his anguish here : But who with me shall hold thy former place ? Thine image , what new friendship can efface ? Ah , none !  --  a father 's tears will cease to flow , Time will assuage an infant brother 's woe ; To all , save one , is consolation known , While solitary friendship sighs alone . Other friends succeeded his earliest one and consoled him for his loss . At Harrow , those he loved best were Wingfield , Tattersall , Clare , Delaware , and Long . His great heart sought to express in verse what it felt for each of them . But it is observable that what touched him most was the excellence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved . To prove this I shall quote in part a poem which he wrote shortly after leaving Harrow for Cambridge , entitled " Childish Recollections . " After giving a picture of his life at Harrow in the midst of his companions , and after describing very freshly and vividly the scene when he was chosen Captain of the School , he exclaims :  --  " Dear honest race ! though now we meet no more , One last long look on what we were before  - -  Our first kind greetings , and our last adieu  - -  Drew tears from eyes unused to weep with you . Through splendid circles , fashion 's gaudy world , Where folly 's glaring standard waves unfurl 'd , I plunged to drown in noise my fond regret , And all I sought or hoped was to forget . Vain wish ! if chance some well-remember 'd face , Some old companion of my early race , Advanced to claim his friend with honest joy , My eyes , my heart , proclaim 'd me still a boy ; The glittering scene , the fluttering groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; The smiles of beauty  --  ( for , alas ! I 've known What ' t is to bend before Love 's mighty throne )  - -  The smiles of beauty , though those smiles were dear , Could hardly charm me , when that friend was near ; My thoughts bewilder 'd in the fond surprise , The woods of Ida danced before my eyes ; I saw the sprightly wand'rers pour along , I saw and join 'd again the joyous throng ; Panting , again I traced her lofty grove , And friendship 's feelings triumph 'd over love . " After deploring his fate :  --  " Stern Death forbade my orphan youth to share The tender guidance of a father 's care . * * * * * * * " What brother springs a brother 's love to seek ? What sister 's gentle kiss has prest my cheek ? * * * * * * * " Thus must I cling to some endearing hand , And none more dear than Ida 's social band : "  --  he goes on to name his dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Wingfield ; Davus , Tattersall ; Lycus , Lord Clare : Euryalus , Lord Delaware ; and Cleon , Long :  --  " Alonzo ! best and dearest of my friends , Thy name ennobles him who thus commends : From this fond tribute thou canst gain no praise : The praise is his who now that tribute pays . Oh ! in the promise of thy early youth , If hope anticipate the words of truth , Some loftier bard shall sing thy glorious name , To build his own upon thy deathless fame . Friend of my heart , and foremost of the list Of those with whom I lived supremely blest , Oft have we drain 'd the font of ancient lore ; Though drinking deeply , thirsting still the more .

Still I remember , in the factious strife , The rustic 's musket aim 'd against my life : High poised in air the massy weapon hung , A cry of horror burst from every tongue ; While I , in combat with another foe , Fought on , unconscious of th ' impending blow ; Your arm , brave boy , arrested his career  - -  Forward you sprung , insensible to fear ; Disarm 'd and baffled by your conquering hand , The grovelling savage roll 'd upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repay ?

Well canst thou boast , to lead in senates fit , A Spartan firmness with Athenian wit : Though yet in embryo these perfections shine , Lycus ! thy father 's fame will soon be thine . Where learning nurtures the superior mind , What may we hope from genius thus refin 'd ! When time at length matures thy growing years , How wilt thou tower above thy fellow-peers ! Prudence and sense , a spirit bold and free , With honor 's soul , united , beam in thee . " Shall fair Euryalus pass by unsung ?

Haply , in polish 'd courts might be thy seat , But that thy tongue could never forge deceit : The courtier 's supple bow and sneering smile , The flow of compliment , the slippery wile . Would make that breast with indignation burn , And all the glittering snares to tempt thee spurn . Domestic happiness will stamp thy fate ; Sacred to love , unclouded e'er by hate ; The world admire thee , and thy friends adore ; Ambition 's slave alone would toil for more .

On the same day our studious race begun , On the same day our studious race was run ; Thus side by side we pass 'd our first career , Thus side by side we strove for many a year ; At last concluded our scholastic life , We neither conquer 'd in the classic strife : As speakers , each supports an equal name , 22 And crowds allow to both a partial fame : To soothe a youthful rival 's early pride , Though Cleon 's candor would the palm divide , Yet candor 's self compels me now to own Justice awards it to my friend alone . " Oh ! friends regretted , scenes forever dear , Remembrance hails you with her warmest tear !

For all my humble fame , to him alone The praise is due , who made that fame my own . Oh ! could I soar above these feeble lays , These young effusions of my early days , To him my muse her noblest strain would give : The song might perish , but the theme might live . Yet why for him the needless verse essay ? His honored name requires no vain display : By every son of grateful Ida blest , It finds an echo in each youthful breast ; A fame beyond the glories of the proud , Or all the plaudits of the venal crowd .

How many a friend deserves the grateful strain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me hush this echo of the past , This parting song , the dearest and the last ; And brood in secret o'er those hours of joy , To me a silent and a sweet employ , While , future hope and fear alike unknown , I think with pleasure on the past alone ; Yes , to the past alone my heart confine , And chase the phantom of what once was mine . " Ida ! still o'er thy hills in joy preside , And proudly steer through time 's eventful tide ; Still may thy blooming sons thy name revere , Smile in thy bower , but quit thee with a tear ,  - -  That tear , perhaps , the fondest which will flow O'er their last scene of happiness below .

Ah , no ! amid the gloomy calm of age You turn with faltering hand life 's varied page ; Peruse the record of your days on earth , Unsullied only where it marks your birth ; Still lingering pause above each checker 'd leaf , And blot with tears the sable lines of grief ; When Passion o'er the theme her mantle threw , Or weeping Virtue sigh 'd a faint adieu ; But bless the scroll which fairer words adorn , Traced by the rosy finger of the morn ; When Friendship bow 'd before the shrine of Truth , And Love , without his pinion , smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , Byron felt that he was saying adieu to youth and to its pleasures , and he was as yet unable to replace these by the feasts of the mind . This filled his heart with regret in addition to the sorrows which he experienced by those reflections upon existence which are common to all poetical natures . The cold discipline of Cambridge fell like ice upon his warm nature . He fell ill , and , by way of seeking a relief to the oppression of his mind , he wrote the above transcribed poem . Harrow is called Ida , as his friends are denominated by fictitious names . To the college itself , and to the recollections which it brought back to his memory of physical and mental suffering , he addresses himself :  --  " Ida ! blest spot , where Science holds her reign , How joyous once I join 'd thy youthful train ! Bright in idea gleams thy lofty spire , Again I mingle with thy playful quire. * * * * * * * My wonted haunts , my scenes of joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foe ; Our feuds dissolved , but not my friendship past , I bless the former , and forgive the last . " The same kind , affectionate disposition can be traced in all his other poems , together with those well-inculcated notions of God 's justice , wisdom , and mercy , of toleration and forgiveness , of hatred of falsehood and contempt of prejudices , which never abandoned him throughout his life . I really pity those who could read " The Tear " without being touched by its simple , plaintive style , written in the tenderest strain , or " L'Amitie est l'Amour sans Ailes , " or the lines to the Duke of Dorset on leaving Harrow , or the " Prayer of Nature , " or his stanzas to Lord Clare , to Lord Delaware , to Edward Long , or his generous forgiveness of Miss Chaworth ; or , again , his lines on believing that he was going to die , his answer to a poem called " The Common Lot , " his reply to Dr. Beecher , and , finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw his friendship :  --  " What friend for thee , howe'er inclined , Will deign to own a kindred care ? Who will debase his manly mind , For friendship every fool may share ? " In time forbear ; amid the throng No more so base a thing be seen ; No more so idly pass along ; Be something , any thing but  --  mean . " Since our object is to show in these effusions of a youthful mind , its natural beauty , and not that genius which is shortly to be developed by contact with the troubles and pains of this life , it may not be irrelevant to our subject to give in parts , if not entirely , some of the poems which he wrote at this time :  --  THE TEAR . " O lachrymarum fons , tenero sacros Ducentium ortus ex animo ; quater Felix ! in imo qui scatentem Pectore te , pia Nympha , sensit. "  --  GRAY . When Friendship or Love our sympathies move , When truth in a glance should appear , The lips may beguile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection 's a Tear . Too oft is a smile but the hypocrite 's wile , To mask detestation or fear ; Give me the soft sigh , while the soul-telling eye Is dimm 'd for a time with a Tear . Mild Charity 's glow , to us mortals below , Shows the soul from barbarity clear ; Compassion will melt where this virtue is felt , And its dew is diffused in a Tear . The man doom 'd to sail with the blast of the gale , Through billows Atlantic to steer , As he bends o'er the wave which may soon be his grave , The green sparkles bright with a Tear . The soldier braves death for a fanciful wreath In glory 's romantic career ; But he raises the foe when in battle laid low , And bathes every wound with a Tear . If with high-bounding pride he return to his bride , Renouncing the gore-crimson 'd spear , All his toils are repaid , when , embracing the maid , From her eyelid he kisses the Tear . Sweet scene of my youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chased each fast-fleeting year , Loth to leave thee , I mourn 'd , for a last look I turn 'd , But thy spire was scarce seen through a Tear . Though my vows I can pour to my Mary no more , My Mary to love once so dear , In the shade of her bower I remember the hour She rewarded those vows with a Tear . By another possest , she may live ever blest ! Her name still my heart must revere : With a sigh I resign what I once thought was mine , And forgive her deceit with a Tear . Ye friends of my heart , ere from you I depart , This hope to my breast is most near : If again we shall meet in this rural retreat , May we meet as we part , with a Tear . When my soul wings her flight to the regions of night , And my corse shall recline on its bier , As ye pass by the tomb where my ashes consume , Oh ! moisten their dust with a Tear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of vanity rear ; No fiction of fame shall blazon my name , All I ask  --  all I wish  --  is a Tear . * * * * * L'AMITIE EST L'AMOUR SANS AILES . Why should my anxious breast repine , Because my youth is fled ? Days of delight may still be mine ; Affection is not dead . In tracing back the years of youth , One firm record , one lasting truth , Celestial consolation brings ; Bear it , ye breezes , to the seat , Where first my heart responsive beat , " Friendship is Love without his wings ! " Through few , but deeply checker 'd years , What moments have been mine ! Now half-obscured by clouds of tears , Now bright in rays divine ; Howe'er my future doom be cast , My soul enraptured with the past , To one idea fondly clings ; Friendship ! that thought is all thine own , Worth worlds of bliss , that thought alone  --  " Friendship is Love without his wings !
