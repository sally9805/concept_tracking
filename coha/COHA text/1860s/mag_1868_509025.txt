NEW MONTHLY MAGAZINE . No . CCXX. - SEPTEMBER , 1868 ,  --  VOL . XXXVII . SILVER AND SILVER PLATE . SILVER is an admirable product of nature . In London once a grain of silver was beaten out so thin that it covered ninety-eight square inches . This experiment proved that silver is more malleable than gold , for a grain of gold has never been spread over more than seventy*-five square inches . If eleven hundred of those films of silver had been laid one upon another , they would have formed a sheet about ns thick as the paper upon which these words are printed . If it had been required to form a pile of them one inch high , about three hundred and twenty thousand leaves would have been necessary . Now three hundred and twenty thousand sheets of good thick printing-paper would make a stack as high as an ordinary church-steeple . If we desired to make a pile of those thinnest leaves of silver as high as that , we should require four or five hundred millions of them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even these inconceivably thin silvery films could be beaten out still thinner if more delicate means could be devised for doing the work , for when the implements employed could effect nothing further the malleability of the metal did not seem to be near exhaustion . Tested in another way , silvcr shows the fineness of its temper , and a slight superiority over gold . When mechanics desire to ascertain tbc tensile strength of a material , they get a slow , steady pull upon a bar of it one inch square , and note how many pounds that bar will bear before being pulled apart . There is a beautiful machine for the purpose , which consists of a series of levers so arranged that half a pound placed upon the first lever pulls five thousand pounds upon the bar to be tested . It has been found that an inch bar of cast lead breaks at 860 pounds , while the same thickness of oak wood will sustain before breaking 17,300 pounds , and locust 20,000 pounds . An inch bar of cast gold will sustain twenty-two thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not break until it has been subjected to a strain of forty-one thousand five hundred pounds . Thus silver is not greatly inferior in strength to the best cast iron , an inch bar of which sustains 59,000 pounds . The best wrought iron , however , will support a weight of eighty-four thouICE 30WL. - 5ILvElI .

It is a curious thing , however , that a mixture of two metals is stronger than either of its ingredients ; and here gold has a slight advantage over silver . An inch bar composed of five ounces of silver and one ounce of copper breaks at forty-eight thousand five hundred pounds ; hut one made of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fifty thousand pound pull is brought to bear upon it . Of the eight metals now ranked as precious , namely , gold , silver , platinum , iridium , rhodium , palladium , ruthenium , and osmium , each possesses some quality or qualities which render it uniquely valuable for some purposes ; but silver is the one which unites in itself the greatest number of useful properties with very great beauty . Few of us have ever seen a gold dinner service . I never did ; but I saw once the large gold communion vessels of a cathedral , and I remember thinking at the time that if silver were fifteen times dearer than gold , instead of gold being fifteen times more costly than silver , we should all feel that silver was by far the more beautiful metal . The appearance of a dinner-table set with silver for a large party is so exceedingly splendid that we canhardlywonder that fashion has adopted this metal for her own . Nothing conveys a more vivid impression of royal magnificence and imperial state . The snowy table-cloth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnished metal glittering and gorgeous under the gas-light , make up a scene which to unaccustomed eyes is literally one of enchantment . Human nature , perhaps , never appears in a more attractive light than when a brave company of men thoroughly groomed , and of fair women elegantly attired , seat themselves at such a table to enjoy one another 's society while partaking of a refined repast . If the act of taking sustenance proves them to be akin to the beasts of the field , the beautiful manner in which that act is performed appears almost to exalt them above mankind . Show me the way people dine , and I will tell you their rank among civilized beings . It is a duty we owe ourselves and one another to glorify and refine eating and drinking , so as to place an infinite distance between ourselves and the brutes , even at the moment when we are enjoying a pleasure which we have in common with them . This duty , however , is one which we are not likely to neglect in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grows as rapidly as our means increase of indulging it . Few readers , probably , will be prepared for the statement that , even now , at this early period of our history , there is more solid silver plate owned in the United States than in any other country in the world . Such is , at least , the opinion of some of the largest dealers in the article , and notably that of the President of the Gorham Silver Manufacturing Company , who has traveled extensively in foreign lands for the sole purpose of studying the trade in silver-ware . Traveled readers will find it difficult to agree with him ; for , at the mention of the subject , there will flash upon their memories the spacious side-boards of Europe covered with clumsy and ponderous vessels of silver , under which a side-board of taste might very properly gioan . There are houses in Europe which exhibit more than a hundred thousand ounces of silver plate to the awe-struck minds of men . But Europe is a gross deceiver . It heaps up great masses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cries out , Behold our abundance ! But the roving American citizen , accustomed to the universal plenty of his own country , says to himself , What matters it if a thousand men have parks , while thirty millions have not gardens ? The palaces and castles of a country are but a mockery and a shame so long as its people dwell in huts . Let no country vftunt its great collections of massive plate so long as not one bride in fifty possesses so much as a silver tea-spoon , nor one child in a thousand a silver mug . The wealthiest country in Europe is Great Britain ; but even there , if all the silver , jewels , watches , and trinkets were divided equally among the people , each individual would have but four pounds ' worth ! In France , where the great mass of the population never see gold or silver except in the form of money , the average is said to be something less than a quarter of this sum . In the United States there are no means of ascertaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deliberate opinion of those who are most conversant with the subject that we possess , and have in daily use , more silver-ware than any other people . There are few families among us so poor as not to have a few ounces of silver plate , and forlorn indeed must be the bride who does not receive upon her wedding-day some articles made of this beautiful metal . The lavish manner in which we are accustomed to give away silver-ware at our silver weddings is well known . There was a silver wedding some time ago in Massachusetts , at which about sixteen thousand ounces of silver were presented . We are all very ready to give to those who do not need our gifts . When the golden wedding of Commodore Vanderbilt was celebrated a few years ago , there were more than a hundred articles of gold given to tha venerable pair . It is , therefore , not so surprising that we should be excelling all nations both in the excellence and the beauty of our plate . Indeed , it may be laid down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on in the United States on a great scale , we shall beat the world in it . Excellence is becoming more and more a necessity to the American manufacturer . It is one of the laws of trade , to which the exceptions are only apparent , that the greater the amount of business done , // // the better it is done . The point of competition now in the United States is not cheapness , but excellence ; and the volume of business is such as to warrant the expenditure of immense sums of money for even comparatively unimportant improvements . Any of our leading men , in leading branches of production , would eagerly give thousands of dollars for a better process or an improved material , end , after possessing it thirty days , would promptly discard it in favor of an improvement more desirable . The secret is , that American manufacturers work for the million . Enjoying a boundless field , and being surrounded by keen competitors , they are compelled not only to produce excellence , hut to produce that excellence by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should all naturally suppose that the makers of solid silver plate would be the servants of the wealthy few ; but democratic America compels even them to study the tastes of the great public , and to practice a certain compliance with its preferences . Of the beauty of American silver and silverplated ware our readers can judge , in some degree , from the specimens presented to them in the accompanying illustrations . The articles are all the products of the Gorham Company of Providence , who have taken the lead iu improvingthis branch of manufacture in the United States . Engravings , however , can only exhibit one of the beautiful features of the objects portrayed-their elegance of form . To appreciate the enduring workmanship , the brilliancy of color , and the splendor of the general effect , the reader may avail himself of those free museums and galleries of art , the shop-windows , where first I saw and admired the Gorham ware , and where now I often linger to note the curious elegance of some alluring novelty of their producing . Blessed be he who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the triumphs of ingenuity and taste without taking upon ourselves the charge of possessing them ! We can not all own these beautiful things , nor even visit the humming manufactory at Providence , where four hundred men sit assiduous , in light , clean , and airy shops , producing articles , silver and silver-plated , from a salt5poon to a " testimonial " of a thousand ounces . The shop-window , however , is the poor man s art-gallery and plate-closet , of which he owns every thing but the key . To speak of the progress in the United States of the various arts involved in the production of silver plate without giving prominence to the Gorham Manufacturing Company would be impossible , for that progress is essentially their work . Their establishment , too , is a representative one . What they have done in silver , other Americans have done and are doing in other materials . During the last thirty years the in ( lustry of the country has been emerging from the condition represented by the word shop to the height and amplitude indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done on the grand scale . The solitary peddler , trudging along over the hills with his pack , has given place to the alert , accomplished Agent , who represents a great Company , travels in the cars , lodges in splendid hotels , regales his customer with turtle and Champagne , and sells more goods in one transaction than the peddler did in a lifetime . Whole streets of retail stores vanish before the superior advantages offered by the Stewart of the town . The petty , anxious proprietors in twenty-five counties are gradually merged into one commanding establishment that supplies half a continent with its products . This tendency is irresistible ; it will continue to operate until the entire work of man is done on the precise scale which unites the greatest efficiency with the greatest economy . The process , the transition , has its inconveniences ; nay , it has its anguish and its tragedy . A thousand cobblers disappear that one prodigious manufactory of shoes may exist , and each cobbler of them all watches with dismay his dwindling business , and struggles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nevertheless , nothing is more certain than that the change will result in an immense and universal increase of the happiness and dignity of man . This revolution , yet incomplete , is well represented in all its many phases by the progress of the Gorham Silver Works , from one man tinkering out silver spoons in a corner of a small shop , to the present manufactory , wherein hundreds of men produce silver-ware by the aid of machinery which multiplies each man 's productive power , and increases his ability to produce uniform excellence beyond computation . It is a literal truth that four thousand men , working in scattered shops by ancient methods , could not accomplish more than four hundred men who work under one roof and one direction , aided by modern machinery ; nor could the ware hammered out by these scattered mechanics bear a moment 's comparison with the uniformity of perfection produced hy a well-regulated manufactory . Roger Williams little thought what he was doing when , after wandering fourteen weeks in the wilderness in mid-winter , " not knowing what bread or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon Narragansett Bay. , and named it Providence , " desiring , " as he said , " it might be for a shelter for persons distressed for oonscience . " His bones lie buried in the heart of the city , but not a stone marks the spot . The people of Providence perhaps feel that there is an incongruity between the stern , uncompromising character of their founder and much of the industry carried on in the town . Providence is getting to be the centre of the manufacture of jewelry , gold* chains , trinkets , silver plate , plated ware , and many other pretty , pleasant things , for which neither the early Puritan nor the early Baptist entertained much respect . The projected monumant to the rigorous Roger Williams would be a standing rebuke to such pursuits , and this may be the reason why the monument exists only upon paper . // Providence , however , fell into this agreeable line of business naturally enough . In old times , when Rhode Island had a thriving commerce with Africa ( buying slaves in Guinea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies for molasses , and bringing home that molasses to be converted into rum ) , parcels of gold dust used frequently to find their way to Newport and Providence . Much of this gold dust was melted and hammered into the form of solid gold heads . There were no savings-banks then , and yet there was surplus money to be saved . Our race has never been much addicted to burying money , and so the custom grew for the industrious girls of New England to invest their savings in these beads of Guinea gold , which they could wear round their necks , and thus exhibit to young men a shining proof of their economical habits . In remote parts of New England old ladies may still be occasionally met who possess a string of those heavy beads , earned by years of self-denial , and made from the gold gained in this infernal commerce . Gold chains were also made of the Guinea gold dust in Providence soon after the Revolutionary War , and hy the year 1800 the making of gold heads and chains was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone on increasing and varying until there are now about seventy-five manufacturers of jewelry and trinkets there . The making of silver-ware is of more recent origin , but it grew directly out of the manufacture of jewelry . Again we have to commend the industrious girls of old New England , , for it was their improved idea of investing money which compelled Jnbez Gorham , manufacturing jeweler , of Providence , to begin the making of silver-ware . Gold beads and chains , considered in the light of a savings-bank , are not without their advantages ; but toward 1830 the best of the girls had grown superior to such a primitive style of investment , which paid no interest and slowly consumed the principal . Jahez Gorham had been for many a year a successful manufacturer of jewelry ; but business was dull with him in 1831 . His peddlers had been buying fewer gold beads of late , fewer yards of gold chain , and a smaller supply of gold rings and pins than usual . Lowell and other manufacturing towns were beginning to afford the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before ; but they were becoming indifferent to the charms of jewelry , and were placing their hopes of future happiness more upon the possession of silver spoons . The peddlers , therefore , ever watchful of the changing fancies of their customers , constantly increased their stock of spoons , and lessened that of the more brilliant but less serviceable articles . A Yankee is seldom at a loss in a conjuncture of this nature . Honest Jabez Gorham said to his peddlers : " Very well ; if it is spoons you want , I can make spoons as well as the Boston people . " And so saying he drove off to Boston , forty miles distant , brought home with him a young man who knew how to make silver spoons , and established the business in a corner of his jewelry-shop . Rude in the extreme were the processes of manufacture then . They used to take a bar of silver , heat it in a common blacksmith 's fire , roll it to the proper thickness by a windlass , and then hammer it into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would forge a horseshoe . Each spoon , in the course of manufacture , had to be made hot nine times . Two men , by exceedingly hard and sometimes violent exertion , could make in a day two dozen of their rough tea-spoons , no two of which were alike in shape or weight . But they answered the purpose intended ; they were approved by the girls of the farm and the factory , who liked them none the less from observing that the girl who had provided herself with a set of silver spoons , in addition to an ample stock of clothes , was the least likely to wait long for a beau . The young men of that day , it seems , had a quality in common with the celebrated Oxford horse , which was so strong that he could " dra*v an inference . " fa this simple way was founded the famous Silver Works , which have grown in thirty-six years to he by far the most extensive and complete in the world . From spoons Jabez Gorham advanced to fruit-knives , butter-knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only articles commonly made by American silversmiths thirty years ago . Silver forks were then scarcely known in the United States . They had been an article of luxury among the nobility of France for a century or more , and had been introduced from that country into England ; but in the United States , as recently as 1835 , their use was confined to persons who possessed considerable wealth . They were not common at that time in any but the best hotels , and not one person in ten had ever seen them used . The small shop of thirty years ago has become a grand manufactory , filled with ingenious machinery . Only men who have personally wrought such a change as this can form an idea of the amount of thought which it absorbs . A system had to be created from the beginning . The object was to apply steam and modern labor-saving devices to the ' performance of a kind of work which for thousands of years had been done slowly and by hand . , The Company wanted to strike out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam , and yet produce a better spoon than the unassisted hand of man ever formed . They wished to make the steam engine take bars and sheets of silver and convert them into a dinner service fit for an emperor or a poet , with only the interposition of human muscles in the parts of the work which are purely artistic  --  the designing , embossing , and engraving . They desired to stamp out a silver fork , form a mug , roll up a napkin-ring , and shape a pitcher as rapidly and certainly as articles are made of tin and fron . From walking // over the factory as it exists to-day , no one can tell what it has cost to do this , because ninetenths of the work of creating a new system is rejected and put out of sight forever . Beau Brummell only wore one cravat , but his servant carried off , we are told , an armful of " failures . " This Magazine may only contain a score of articles ; but in order to select that small number , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spoon-making machinery in these works was ten years in reaching its present efficiency , and now that it is all but perfect , it looks to a visitor as though it must have worked just so from the start . In such an establishment , too , there is much that does not catch the eye at alL There are , for example , in this manufactory eight or nine distinct tystems of pipes  --  the veins , arteries , and air-passages of the industrial system . There are pipes running through all the forty rooms which convey the " dead steam " which warms them . There are tin pipes for the whispering of messages and orders . There are pipes for the " live " steam which heats some of the liquids employed . There are pipes for the pure rainwater needed in many processes . There are pipes for hard water used for all the common purposes . There are pipes for carrying to the basement the water containing particles of gold or silver . There are pipes for the gas which lights the building ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wind " which is used in blowing some of the furnaces to the great heat which is occ*-sionally required . A visitor would as little observe these pipe systems as we ordinarily do those in the bodies of living creatures . When a new wing is added , it is no slight effort of mechanical ingenuity to place the new rooms in connection with the pipe systems of the main edifice . The Company , however , during the formation of the new establishment , did not delay to attempt the higher branches of their business . It was a great day for them when they exhibited in Providence their first silver tea set . The design and the wax models were executed for them in New York . It was the old Chinese pattern , with chased scenes representing the culture of tea and coffee . From their total want of all proper facilities for such work it was hammered out with great labor and expense . Nevertheless , they were amply rewarded-not , indeed , in money , but in glory . When it was exhibited at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind ever executed in Rhode Island , it excited the highest admiration , and readily found a punThaser at seven hundred dollars . Their triumph , however , was shortlived , for the designer , not holding in awe these unknown men of Providence , dishonorably sold the same design to a New York *ilversmith ; so that when next a member of the Company was in Broadway he was horrified to see a fac-simile of their tea set in a shop-window , and to hear the Company charged with piracy . There is still much fraud similar to this practiced in all countries . The Gorham Company , who never yet borrowed nor imitated a pattern , have frequently seen their own designs servilely copied in Sheffield ware , and offered for sale in our cities in competition with their own . They have also seen in Britannia metal , covered with the merest film of silver , articles which they had originated in solid sib ver only a few weeks before . There is little chance of redress in this species of plunder , and they are frequently obliged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sincerest flattery . In the manufacture of silver-ware the first operation is , of course , to buy the silver . Wall Street is the usual source of supply . Occasionally , however , a long-hoarded treasure will find its way to the melting-pot from remote and TEA 5ET. - 5ILYER. // unexpected quarters . The vicissitudes of life sometimes consign to the crucible a quantity of the clumsy " old plate " which people used to cherish with so much pride ; and many persons now deliberately exchange their ancient implemeuts and vessels for the elegant creations of modern taste . Recently the Gorham Company received from Ogdensburg , in the State of New York , a bag of silver coins for melting , which had been the secret hoard of a miser for forty years , and was found to contain three thousand dollars ' worth of the precious metal . There were coins of every country and of every denomination , a few of which were of considerable value as specimens . The poor man had counted these rough , dull coins , no doubt , a thousand times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasure and sure resonrce in time of need . Useless to him , they found their way at last to the melting-room , to be converted into forms of beauty , and adorn the tables of more generous spirits . Generally , however , it is to Wall Street or its vicinity that the makers of silver-ware resort for their daily supply of the precious metals . In these times , when the price of gold and silver changes every minute or two , and sometimes more than once in a minute , no one buys a large quantity in advance . There are often in course of treatment , in the various apartments of the Gorham factory , as much as three tons of silver ; but it is only necessary to start one or two thousand ounces every morning on their progress through the establishment in order to keep every department in full activity . The entire consumption of silver in the arts throughout the world is estimated at one hundred thousand ounces for each working-day . Three precious commodities have to be purchased by this Company . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ware . Usually the standard of purity for silver American and French silver coin being nine hundred parts silver to one hundred parts copper , the genuine plate of those countries has conformed to that standard . English coin is nine hundred and twenty- five parts silver to seventy-five parts copper , and , consequently , English plate , when it is honestly made , is of that degree of purity . To this standard has been applied , for six hundred and seventy years , the word now so familiar , and yet so pregnant with meaning - Sterling . The derivation of this word was formerly supposed to be lost in the haze of antiquity , but it is now known to be only an abbreviated form of Easterlinq . The correctness of this derivation becomes apparent from several passages in ancient historians . The following , from Camden , suffices of itself : " In the time of King Richard the First , monie coined in the east parts of Germanie began to be of especiall request in England for the puritie thereof , and was called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were called Easterliags ; and shortly after , some of that countrie , skillful in mint matters and alloies , were sent for into this realme to bring the come to perfeefion ; which since that time was called of them sterling , for Easterliag . " This is conclusive . Sterling plate is really no better , except in pecuniary value , than coin plate ; nevertheless , the Gorham Company , whose fundamental irinciple of action is , and ever has been , to produce the absolutely best silver-ware made in the world , have now adopted the sterling standard , and guarantee all their plate to contain nine hundred and twenty-five parts in a thousand of pure silver . Hence the necessity for purchasing something besides the daily supply of , coin . Coin being the form in which silver is usually bought for manufacturing purposes , the Company are obliged to buy a certain quantityof pure silver for the purpose of raising the standard to sterling , which is usually brought to New York in the form of small , rough , silver bricks . These are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very rarely .999k . Perfectly pure silver is scarcely ever sold in the market , nor indeed is it required for any of the purposes of business . Besides the daily supply of silver , silversmiths must also have a certain quantity of gold for TEA SET-PLATED. // daily consumption . Almost all fine silver plate is now lined with gold , and there is an occasional demand for small articles of solid gold plate , such as pocket communion vessels , saltcellars , snuff-boxes , medals , and other testimonial pieces . I saw myself , at the Gorham Works , at Providence , the other day , a testimonial in course of manufacture which contained three or four pounds of gold , upon which an artist had been working steadily for seven months . All these precious articles-silver coin , pure silver , and gold-are sold by the coin and bullion dealers of Wall Street . Like other commodities , they are sometimes scarce , sometimes abundant , and occasionally superabundant . The time has been when silversmiths could not buy in all New York five hundred dollars ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chatham Street hunting up little lots of dimes and halfdimes that used to be displayed in the windows of lottery shops . Generally , however , large kegs of Mexican dollars are to be seen in the vaults or behind the counters of the dealers in bullion , as numerous as kegs of nails in a hardware store . The price is not so much affected either by scarcity or by abundance as is the case with other articles . The present price of silver coin is one dollar nineteen cents and a fraction , in gold , per ounce ; but during the last four years it has never been lower than one dollar sixteen cents , nor higher than one dollar twenty-four cents . The average price of pure silver is not far from one dollar thirty-five cents , in gold , per ounce . The purchase of these precious metals is accomplished with Gold - Room celerity . The purchaser strolls into the region of the moneychangers , looks in at brokers ' offices as he goes by , and , with scarcely any expenditure of breath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BUTTEn DIsH-SLavER. the price of gold , no words are necessary nowadays to ascertain its momentary changcs ; for every broker 's office is provided with a goldclock or indicator , which is connected with the telegraphic apparatus in the Gold-Room . The moment a transaction in gold has occurred at a price different from the last quotation , the operator communicates the new price by a click or two to every indicator in the street , and to every important business centre in the country . As the price frequently changes that operator is kept pretty busy , and the news from the GoldRoom is running over the wires continually . The buyer of silver , therefore , when he is informed that silver is nineteen and three-quarters ( i.e. $1 19k , in gold , per ounce ) , has but to glance at the gold indicator in order to complete his information . It often happens that while he is making the calculation with his lead-pencil , before drawing his check , the indicator announces that gold is a point higher or lower . I saw , myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought at half past two , which , at a quarter to three , had increased in nominal or paper value ten dollars . These bullion and coin d*p&amp;s in Wall Street are interesting to the unaccustomed visitor . There is something respectable , if not impressive , about a long row of large , smooth kegs of Mexican or Peruvian dollars rough from the mint . It is pleasing to behold a line of young gentlemen doing what the king did in his counting-house at the hour when the queen was eating bread and honey in the parlor . It produces a certain effect upon the mind when you kick against something hard and heavy upon the floor of a vault , and find , on picking it up , that it is a large gold brick covered with stamped letters and figures , from which you learn that it is worth two or three thousand dollars . Nor is it less gratifying to see a little wall of smaller silver bricks , marked .999 fine . Highly interesting , also , is it to observe little trays full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we read of in sea - novels but rarely handle . Most interesting of all is it to see great heaps of the small silver coin of the country , long lost to sight , to memory dear . I ventured to ask the great King of the Bullion Dealers - one of those mighty men who buy half a million of gold with a wink , and sell it again with a nod-I say 1 took courage to ask this potentate what had become of all the small silver coin which we used to have in circulation , but which children six years of age have never seen . " Where , " said I , " are the // SILVER AND SILVER PLATE . dimes and half-dimes and quarters at this moment ? The silver-smiths melt only dollars and half-dollars . Where , then , have the small coins gone ? " He replied that a large quantity of them had found their way to Canada ; more still to the West Indies and South America ; but that there is still a large amount of it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant and timid people . A proof of this is that parcels of it frequently come into " the street " from distant points . I saw , myself , that day ten thousand dollars ' worth in one heap , which had just arrived from the country , and was about to he shipped to Havana , where it would then he used to advantage . When you have bought a quantity of silver in Wall Street the next thing is to get it carried home . There are two hundred and eight pounds in twenty-five hundred ounces . We must have a cart . All the bullion and coin of Wall Street is carried about the streets in common , open carts , precisely such as are used in carrying ordinary merchandise . For twenty-two years past one carman , John C. Barkley , best known in the street as " Honest John , " whose three carts stand at the busy corner of Wall and Broad streets , has done the carting for the bullion dealers and hankers of the city , any of whom would trust him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ruddy , Honest John has in his countenance precisely the expression which we should expect to see in the face of one who for so many years has borne so honorable a name . He began in the street twenty-seven years ago , and , after his fifth year , he became the established carman of the coin and bullion men . It is his carts that go to the California steamers and convey their kegs of gold to the vaults to which they are consigned . his carts assist to restore the financial balance between the two continents by conveying gold to and from the Cunard steamers in Jersey City . He has occasionally carried for short distances , down hill , a million dollars in gold , which weighs two tons ; but his opinion is that seven hundred thousand dollars is about as much as a humane man will ever permit his horse to draw over these rough pavements for any considerable ( histance . On a busy day he will have as many ns twenty loads of precious metals . A load of gold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a clerk of the house to which it belongs ; but it often happens that Honest John is quite alone when he has as much gold on his cart as a horse can draw . For such service he gets higher compensation than when he carries an office-desk or a load of printing-paper ; and , indeed , he has the air of a man who could show a little gold and silver of his own if there were occasion . The silver being safely delivered by Honest John , and transported by express to Providence , it begins its tortuous and noisy course through the manufactory . Its exact weight is first recorded , as well as the degree of purity which it is supposed to possess . But in this establishmeat the character of no silver is taken upon trust ; not even that which bears upon its face the stamp of the United States Mint . The consequences of an error are too serious to be risked . With every piece of silver sold by this Company a written guarantee , in legal form , is given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silver is not of sterling purity , to refund the price , and yet allow the purchaser to keep the article . The utmost care , therefore , is taken , and must he taken , to guard against the possibility of the metal falling below the standard . Not merely the character of the establishment depends upon it , but its existence . So complete and certain is the system , however , that , during the entire period which has elapsed since the formation of this Company , not a piece of plate under the standard guaranteed has ever left the factory . This is a good deal to say of a business which has sent forth many millions of dollars ' worth of silver-ware . It is , nevertheless , as true of this establishment as of the Mint at Philadelphia , and for the same reason . Never but once was the Gorham plate called in question . One morning , several years ago , a letter reached the manufactory from a great firm of jewelers , informing them that a certain tea-pot , bearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard . An engraver , it seems , had saved the silver chips cut from the tea-pot by the tool , and hind them assayed . He reported to his employers , as the result of the assay , that the silver was eightthousandths below the standard guaranteed by the Company , and this report led to the writing of the letter just meiitioned . The Company were in consternation ! If one piece was wrong many must be . If fraud had been committed upon them it must have been committed upon system , and concealed with consummate art . The works were instantly stopped . Filings of ' finished plate , as well as from pieces in various stages of manufacture , were most scruptilously assayed . Every thing was correct , and even more than correct ; for this Company have always used the additional precaution of making their silver-ware a little above the guaranteed standard . Still puzzled , though less alarmed than before , they wrote to their correspondents , asking them to cut a piece out of the middle of the tea-pot , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , assay one themselves , and have the third assayed at the Mint . The result of each of these assays completely restored the character of the tea-pot ; for each of them proved the silver to be of a higher standard of purity than it had claimed to be . The house apologized for the error of their engraver most handsomely . lIe had probably been deceived by a few particles of base metal getting mixed with the silver cuttings . The first thing done at the factory is to pick out the counterfeit coin . Before the war , when the coin consigned to the melting-pot had froquently formed part of the circulating mediunin , there used to be four or five counterfeits // in almost every thousand silver coins . At It is surprising to see what a great number present , when the dollars come directly from of curious operations are performed upon a fine the mints of Mexico and Peru , a counterfeit is piece of plate , from the time when the dull sheet seldom found . Nevertheless , none of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy hour when it graces a bride 's trousseau , or shines resplendent upon her table . In this one manufactory there are carried on twelve distinct trades , to each of which boys are regularly apprenticed . It is a trade by itself ( and a very good trade too ) to make silver forks , spoons , and small table-ware . It is another to make the larger silver vessels . Chasing is , of course , a separate and most difficult branch . Embossing is a trade . Die-cutting , pattern-making , moulding , engraving , burnishing , plating , designing , polishing , and stamping , all are separate trades , to which boys are apprenticed . Let us look about for a moment among the forty rooms of this humming hive of industry , and observe what these skillful workmen are doing with so much steadiness and care . The informing soul of all this beautiful labor dwells in the Designing Room . To perfect utility until it becomes elegance ; to produce forms novel and pleasing , because they are perfectly convenient ; to devise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to adorn ; always to keep a little in advance of the public taste , so as to educate while delighting it-these are the constant aims of the designer of an establishment like this . It is easy for an accomplished designer to produce articles many years in advance of the public demand . Occasionally the Gorhain artists have amused themselves by chasing a vase in so exquisite a manner that upon twenty dollars ' worth of silver there was several hundred dollars ' worth of work ; but , as yet , there are not , upon the whole continent of America , more than a dozen people who could be expected to purchase such a dainty product . The triumphs aimed at here are such as the whole silver-using public can appropriate . The most signal success of this kind ever achieved , perhaps , was the Gorham Company 's well-known " Cottage Pattern " of forks and spoons , designed in a happy moment by a member of the Company some years ago . It is the perfection of elegance and the perfection of convenience happily combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this design , his experienced eye perceived at a glance all its merit , and after looking at it for some time in silence , he exclaimed with professional enthusiasm , " This is an inspiration ! " Every profession , art , and trade , has its triumphs , which excite a feeling among its nwmbers which others can not always share . The public , however , has ratified the verdict of the trade in this instance ; and in spite of the tempting novelties continually introduced , still manifests a preference for the cottage pattern . It is amusing to a person ignorant of their business to witness the delight with which a fortunate conception of this kind is hailed by those who are competent to judge of it . Such a spoon and fork , taken upon trust ; but each coin is subjected to a process which twists it asunder , and then drops it upon the heap below . If it is false the fact is twice betrayed : first , by the manner in which it tears apart ; and , secondly , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When these broken coins are placed in the crucible to he melted , enough pure silver is added to bring the metal up to the standard of sterling , and , as before remarked , a little above it . To guard against possible errors in the Melting Room , once a week a small piece of silver is tnken here and there from work in progress . Twice a month these pieces are melted together , and a portion of the resulting ingot is taken to the United States Assay Office in Wall Street , where it is assayed , and its degree of purity certified . This assaying is a very simple matter . A small portion of the silver is weighed with the utmost exactness possible ; then the alloy , by an expeditious and easy process , is removed from it ; after which the silver is weighed again . The weight it has lost shows , of course , the quantity of alloy with which it had been blended . Melting silver is a nice operation . The broken coin and pure silver , from two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a crucible , which is placed upon an anthracite fire subjected to a strong , natural draught . The difficulty is to pour off the liquid metal at the precisely best moment . If it is allowed to get too hot the silver will lose much of its malleability ; it will become what the workmen call " puddingy ; " it will not " work well , " as they say ; sometimes nothing can be done with it until it has been melted again . If , on the contrary , the silver is taken from the fire before it is hot enough it will crack and fly , and must be remelted . It is only when it has been poured off at the right instant that it becomes the tough , ductile , and malleable silver previously described . The melter judges only from the appearance of the metal , which , when it is just hot enough , assumes for a moment a certain cloudy aspect , easy to distinguish , but difficult to describe . Among the secrets of this nice operation there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the superstitions of the trade ; but experience shows that they are not . The liquid metal is run into one of two forms . If it is to be converted into spoons , forks , or other solid ware , it is cast into bars of the proper thickness ; hut if into hollow ware , it is run into sheets , or wide , thin bars , which are called " skillets . " These are next taken into what is called the Flattening Room , where , between ponderous iron rollers , they are rolled to the thinness desired , and thus become the material out of which all the infinite variety of silver vessels are made . // for example , as the Gorham Company 's " Medallion Pattern , " which has had a great run among persons fond of the original and peculiar , causes a stir and excitement in Maiden Lane when it is first exhibited . Its merits are canvassed like those of a new hook when the first copies come from the bindery , or of a new picture when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate is soon determined . When the representatives of leading houses have examined it , they generally express their opinion of its merits by the number they order . When the pretty " Rosette " pattern was first shown , a few weeks ago , at the warerooms of this Company , a large dealer instantly gave eloquent utterance to his approval in words like these : " Send me forty dozen . " All the great American triumphs in silver have been of this kind . In truth , our millionaires and people of high fashion do not accumulate silver by the hundred-weight . Our Astors and Vanderhilts and Belmonts have enough for the purposes of elegant hospitality , and enough to make an inviting show upon their side - boards ; and this is replenished or changed as novelties are introduced . The great market for silver , however , is , as before remarked , among the multitude of the thriving people of the country . Hence a tea service , to be successful , must be convenient , and must derive its chief beauty from the symmetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have our tea-pots donbled in value by having a beautiful picture chased upon them of a scene in the tea country . For one person who will buy a highly- chased tea service at twelve hundred dollars , there are twenty who will yield to the allurements of a plainer set at four hundred and fifty to six hundred . Upon being shown into the Designing Room of this establishment , the visitor is surprised to find himself in an apartment which has the appearance of a library . It is indeed well stored with books , and with illustrated works of the costliest description . All beauty is akin . A designer may get from an arch of the Cologne Cathedral an idea for the handle of a mustardspoon , and infuse the spirit of a gorgeous mosque into the design for a caster . lIe may borrow from the gnarled branch of a brave old oak a crook for a pitcher - handle , and imitate the droop of a vine in the bend of its spout . Antique vases , the Elgin marbles , books of animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pictures , statuary , architecture , and all other accumulations of grace and beauty , may be useful to those whose business it is to cover with grace and beauty the tables of mankind . It is interesting to walk about the warerooms and see how the whole realm of beauty has been despoiled for the decoration of human life . Ev SILVER PLATE . 443 CAsTEu. - rLAT D. ery pretty leaf , tendril , bud , blossom ; every arch , groin , and pinnacle ; every pleasing bird , animal , and fish ; every hideous monster and reptile ; all that ancient art , tradition , and literature have of elegant , grotesque , or curious , as well as all that modern life has to suggest of striking and novel-here you behold it , in brilliant silver and burnished gold . Nor , with all this assistance , is it an easy thing to make a ( iesign which shall be at once delightful to the eye and convenient to the hand , easy to clean , and not too difficult to construct . No talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical skill , the perfect integrity , and the courageous enterprise of the Company would not have sufficed to rear so vast and costly an establishment in one generation . In walking about the other apartments of this interesting establishment the visitor is surprised most of all to see the ponderous engines elsewhere used in subduing common materials here employed in conquering the precious metals . There is a room in which salvers and other large objects are stamped into form by the fall of huge masses of iron weighing a ton and a half , the thump of which would shake the building from its propriety if there were not many feet of granite masonry under them , and piles under the masonry . In another apartment silver cups , napkin-rings , and " such small deer " are made . In another the large vessels , // such as tea-pots , coffee-pots , ice-pitchers , are coming into shape upon lathes with admirable ease and rapidity . The chasers sit in other rooms in rows , each with a piece of plate under treatment , filled with hardened pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most interesting operations of all , and gives play to all degrees of skill , from the ordinary dexterity of an engraver up to the genius which executes such pictures as the Night and Morning of Thorwaldsen . Here are some of the artists of the establishment , a few of whom sit and work faithfully at their vocation , while they pine for the pleasant haunts of Paris or Germany which they have left . The first year in America is a hard one to these artists , and it occasionally happens that , completely subdued and overcome by homesickness , they suddenly take passage for their native land , from which they not unfrequently return , resume their place , and become domesticated among us . Generally , however , after pining and moping for a few months , they take root in the new soil , and bloom out into joyous American citizens . The Polishing Rooms are full of noise and bustle . That gorgeous polish , the joy and the despair of housekeepers , is produced by soft wheels that revolve with inconceivable rapidity . Polishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ series of operations , each of which heightens the splendor of the surface . The Modeling and Moulding Rooms , and those where the patient die-cutters sit , the rooms of the embossers , engravers , patternmakers , burnishers , all detain the interested rxTcazu. - sTLvzR. visitor . A curious place to visit is the extensive cellar , where all the dust , the sweepings , the ashes , and other refuse of the factory , is subjected to treatment by which the particles of silver are recovered . The sweepings are burned in a furnace , and the ashes are then ground to the finest powder , from which the silver is washed by a process similar to that employed at the mines . There is , after all , in an establishment like this , a large quantity of silver wasted and lost beyond recovery . The unavoidable waste in a factory of this magnitude would amount to about a hundred ounces a week but the actual loss is always much greater . Every ounce of silver that is given out is weighed , and it is weighed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plate , in its course from the Melting Room to the warehouse , is weighed many times , and its weight many times recorded . Nevcrtheless , when the precious metals go such a long and tedious journey as this , it is seldom that the whole quantity arrives at its destination . The department of this manufactory which is apt to interest the stranger longest is that in which the silver is applied to the fine plated ware , introduced recently by this Company . Even in this land of abundance we can not all pay twelve thousand dollars for a dinner set with which to entertain a company of twentyfour persons ; nor can we all have our tea and coffee handed about upon a silver salver worth a thousand dollars . Many of us have to think twice before purchasing a plain domestic tea set for five hundred dollars , and then go away without doing it . A solid silver iceI pitcher , which holds a gallon of water , and costs two hundred and fifty dollars , looks well upon a rosewood side-board ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination . When we have bought a few table-spoons and forks at sixty or seventy dollars a dozen , and established a silver mug for the baby , and a silver napkin-ring for father and mother , most of us think we have done enough for glory . Hence the Gorham Company have considerately added the department to their works in which a good thick surface of silver is applied to articles composed of metals more durable , though less brilliant . They do not offer the public that insensate trash , which looks more radiant than plate itself for a few weeks or months , and then rapidly fades away into shabbiest brass , or dents into manifest pewter . The ware here referred to would he excellent , and take a fine polish , without a coating of silver ; and yet upon it is laid a silver surface which will last forty years . The // object is to produce plated ware which shall have all the splendor and durability of the best plate , at about one - fourth the cost . Thus a silver tea service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred dollars , costs in this superior kind of plated ware from one to two hundred dollars . Of course the price limits the sale of this description of ware also ; but the number of people in the United States who will not lumber up their shelves and side-boards with brass and pewter having only a " blush " of silver upon it , is always on the increase . I do not wish to intimate that the maunfacturers of the inferior plated ware fail to give their customers an equivalent for their money . If the silver is thin , the price is low . On a plated table-spoon it is rare to find more silver than enters into the composition of a five-cent piece , and it must be a large vessel indeed upon which a dollar 's worth of silver is spread . But then the price dwindles as the precious metal diminishes , and the competition among rival makers always tends to keep the price very close to the real value of the article . It is the keenness of this competition which causes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious fact that a very thin film of silver takes a rather better polish , and shows a finer surface , than a good thick plate , such as our Providence friends apply . But we were speaking of the process . In old times-i. e. , thirty years ago-silver plating was a most laborious and difficult operation . A thin plate of silver was tied by wires to an vAsE. - sILvEa . OOBLET. - SILvEIL. ingot of copper forty times its thickness , and the two were skillfully smelted together . Ponderous machinery gradually rolled the ingot into a sheet of the proper thickness , out of which the plated articles were made . The present method is as different as possible from this clumsy and Titanic process . The articles to be plated are first of all completely made and finished . A fine surface is put upon them , so that the nickel resembles silver before silver is applied to it . They are then suspended in a solution of silver , through which a powerful current of electricity is made to pass by a galvanic battery . Instantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most beautiful smoothness and uniformity upon e ' *ery part of the ware , both inside and outside , and continues to be deposited as long as the electric current flows . Here is the opportunity for deception . To place upon articles the proper thickness of silver is an operation requiring from three to seven hours . Nevertheless , a vessel of large size is completely coated with silver after remaining in the solution only three minutes , and the silver will he thick enough to admit of being burnished to the highest degree of brilliancy . The only objection to it is , that that brilliancy vanishes after a few days of ordinary usage . The Company have recently introduced an ingenious but simple apparatus which enables them to regulate the quantity of silver applied to the surface of articles to the fraction of a grain . This admirable device was purchased at the Paris Exposition of l862* . It reduces to absolute certainty what before was uncertain , and in which certainty was only approximated by a troublesome system of weighing . Oddly enough , this new plated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time ago by // the Bears of Wall Street in Pacific Mail Stock . Complete services of the Gorham plated goods were ordered for the new steamer Japan , belonging to this Company , and now plying between San Francisco and China . Before sending away the goods , Messrs . Tiffany and Co. , through whom they were supplied , exhibited them in the windows of their store in Broadway , and a truly superb appearance they presented , filling all the four windows . Tbis ware , indeed , is so exactly like solid plate in appearance that no silver-smith can perceive any difference . Soon one of the agents of the Pacific Mail Company came up town to beg Messrs . Tiffany to remove the gorgeous show from their windows , because the Bears , among other means of depressing the stock , were circulating the rumor that the Company were guilty of " the most reckless extravagance " in fitting up the new steamship , even going so far as to furnish the tables with solid silver plate . The services were accordingly removed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the brilliant spectacle . The Bears were signally mistaken in supposing the purchase of this ware to he an extravagant outlay . On the contrary , it was the result of a closely calculating economy . China services would , indeed , have been reckless extravagance , and still more reckless would it have been to provide for a steamship the brazen trash usually styled plated ware , that would have worn into shabbiness in one voyage . It was found by actual experiment and comparison before the order was given by Messrs . Tiffany that the Gorham ware had upon its surface four and a half times as much silver as the English plate commonly sold in this market . The Gorham ware was selected solely because it was the cheapest for the purpose . When we consider the great consumption of silver in the decorative arts , and the growing taste for silver plate in all its useful forms , we may naturally be apprehensive that the supply of this beautiful metal will prove inadequate to the future wants of mankind . There is little danger of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ones are exhausted . Potosi , which only began to be worked about the year 1550 , has furnished thirteen hundred millions of ounces of silver . In Mexico there is one vein from which *more than three million ounces have been taken , and another which has been worked six miles , and yielded annually for many years two hundred and eighty - six thousand pounds of silver . Give Mexico peace and suppress robbery on her highways , and she will dig you twenty-five million ounces per annum . In Norway they boast of having once brought out of a mine a mass of pure silver that weighed eight hundred and forty pounds ; and there is a piece in one of the London museums , where it is kept as a specimen , that weighs three hundred pounds . The total annual product of this metal , leaving out that of China and India , is now estimated at eleven thousand tons ! Compared with this enor mous quantity the two thousand ounces melted daily at the Gorham silver works in Providence seem trifling indeed . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectable total of twenty-six tons a year . In China and India , which are rich in silver , the metal still serves as a kind of savings-bank . The people there bury it against a rainy day . A recent traveler in China conjectures that , since the present rebellion began , the Chinese have buried five hundred million dollars ' worth of coin , most of which is silver , and much of which will never be recovered . It seems just as natural for the inhabitants of Hindostan to bury a bag of silver in some out-of-the-way corner of a field as it is for a New York merchant . at half past two r.iu. , to send round his money and checks to the bank . It is buried in the deepest secrecy . " In India , " says a noted traveler , " the Hindoos bury their money underground , often with such secrecy as not to trust their own children with the knowledge of it ; and it is amazing what they will suffer rather than betray it . When their tyrants have tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defile them ; but even that fails ; for , resentment prevailing over love of life , they frequently rip up their bowels or poison themselves , and carry the secret to their graves . And the sums lost in this manner in some measure account why the silver of India does not increase , though there are such quantitles continually coming into it and none going out . " In India , too , silver is the metal usually employed in the decoration of the person . So universal is the custom in Hindostan of wearing ear-rings , rings , pins , and bracelets that the amount of silver thus absorbed has been estimated as high as fifteen hundred millions of dollars , or ten dollars for each inhabitant . Nor is it only in semi-barbarous countries that the custom prevails of burying the precious metals . As in France during the Revolution , so in all countries at times of civil commotion , timid people hasten to hide their treasures beyond the reach of the marauder and the tax-gatherer . In this way , doubtless , much silver was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply must needs be abundant to make good such ceaseless waste , aswell as to furnish the vast quantities of the metal legitimately employed . Besides being widely distributed over the earth , silver pervades many substances from which it can be extracted . The brilliancy which we observe upon the surface of lead is due in part to the presence of this precious metal . A ton of good lead contains from twelve to eighty ounces of silver ; and if there is only the smaller of these quantities , there has been discovered a process by which it can be profitably extracted . In Great Britain they are now getting out of their lead seven hundred thousand ounces of pure silver every year , all of which used to be lost , and the removal of which , strange to say , improves the lead so palpably as to enhance its price . Chumists // tell us , too , that the water of the ocean is so impregnated with silver that it pays to extract the precious metal from the copper sheathing of old ships . One experimenter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons of silver . Notwithstanding the additions made in modern times to the world 's stock of gold , the supply of silver has always been more ahundant . In the year 1150 an ounce of gold would buy but nine onnces of silver . In Shakspeare 's day an ounce of gold was worth eleven ounces of silver . At present we must give fifteen ounces of silver for one of gold . This gradual cheapening is the more remarkable because a large quantity of silver is so used every day that it can never be recovered . There is now in circulation in the whole world an amount of coin equal in value to twenty-five hundred millions of dollars , upon which there is an annual loss by mere wear of thirty-eight millions of dollars ; and the greater part of this irrecoverable loss is from the coin most carried and handled - silver . Millions of ounces also are spread in films and washes over buttons , buckles , harnesses , as well as upon articles supposed by an innocent public to be " plated . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is coated so thinly with silver that the ware weighs a little less after the silver is put on than it did before . Ridiculous as this seems it is nevertheless true ; for the impurities which must be removed from a metallic surface before silver can be applied to it outweigh the film of silver ( twelve hundred times thinner than printing-paper ) which is spread over it . There are scales in Wall Street which can weigh an infant 's hair , and vet can not weigh the " blush " of silver , as the workmen happily style it , upon what is called " target-excursion plate , " which is presented by generous Aldermen to their constituents in the merry month of October . Nevertheless a good many tons of silver are annually wasted upon trash of that kind , and in ware of somewhat higher grades . But there is silver enough for the adornment of the tables of mankind for many an age to come . It seems as if nature had provided for her favorite , man , not only the amplest means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty for its decoration . I am aware that Goethe and other philosophers have expressed an aversion to the idea that the beautiful things of the earth were made for us . The German poet descants somewhere in his works , with disapproval , upon the line of Gray in which it is said that a flower which affords no delight to human senses wastes its sweetness on the desert air . The Duke of Argyle , in his " Reign of Law , " intimates an opinion that the reason why so many objects are beautiful which the eye of man never beholds is , that the Creator of those objects contemplates with constant pleasure the beauty himself has made . I was reminded of this interesting conjecture while I was admiring the wonderfully beautiful tinting of the angel-fish that was boiled in his own tank at the burning of Barnum 's Museum . I could not but ask myself why there should be such singular , such refined , such purposed beauty upon a creature formed to glide unnoticed in the gteen depths of tropical seas , and destined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the deep , that would relish him quite as well " plain " as " colored . " Philosophers find a mystery in this . Probably they , will never be able to give a better explanation of it than the common belief of Christendom : That when the universe was planned it was foreseen that this earth would one day be densely peopled with an inquisitive , aspiring race , ever improving , who would love to surround themselves with beautiful objects . Hence beauty was stored away . against the time when civilized man would need it . For many ages the huge mahogany - trees of honduras existed before they furnished side-boards to man ; but the time came at length when they began to accomplish this final purpose of their creation . And so the angel-fish visits us in this late age of the world to convey to artistic men a lirecious hint , and afford them an exquisite illustration of the combination of colors . In this same America , too , are garnered up those exhaustless stores of the beautiful metals which will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one day to be lived upon this continent . Indeed , when we look within us and see what man is , loves , and wants , and then look about us and observe what this earth is , what it has upon it and within it , it is difficult to think that the earth and man were not made for one another ; and especially when we discover that the amplest provision has been laid away not only for an advanced civilization , but for the most profuse and refined decoration of human life when the whole earth shall swarm with civilized beings . But a truce to speculation . Let us remark , in conclusion , that these enterprising men of Rhode Island , in establishing and organizing this beautiful kind of industry in their native State , have rendered services to the nation which entitle them to such national recognition as may be afforded by the present notice . From time to time , as - their business has expanded , they have brought from foreign lands artisans and artists to exercise and ( what is of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the United States . About ninety-five foreigners in all have crossed the ocean in compliance with their invitation , most of whom* have remained among us , and are still in the employment of this Company . Thus the various arts ihvolved in the production of fine silver plate and plated ware are firmly planted here , and could not but flourish though the Providence Company were destroyed . No solid silver plate is now imported into the United States-none whatever ; the Gorham plate has utterly driven it from the American 0 // market . Nor is there any plated ware of h*qk quality imported . Five years ago all the really serviceahle plated ware-all that it was good economy to huy for household use-was brought here from Sheffield and Birminghiim . The importation of such ware has now ceased , and nothing is imported except the cheaper kinds , which are only cheap in the imagination of the purchaser . The Gorham plated ware blocks the way , making it impossible for the foreign article of equal merit to be imported at a profit . This beautiful ware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Providence makers dared not produce their best-dared not abandon the old forms endeared to the public hy habit and protected by fashion . Many a time they were obliged to modify or lay aside a fine design only hecause the taste of the puhlic was not " up to it " - it was too simple , too violent a departure from established patterns , or else it was " chased beyond the market . " At present they find the public taste responsive to their own . Nothing now can he too elegant to be appreciated ; and whatever the Designing Room at Providence approves wins prompt applause in the warerooms of New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Cincinnati , Chicago , St. Louis , and San Francisco . With increase of wealth there must either come tasteless and barbaric pomp or there must come higher refinement , better education , and more elegant modes of living . We shall either spend our surplus money in pleasures that ennoble or in pleasures that debase . It was well , then , for the more prosperous people of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver from Providence , and it was well for those cunning men of Providence to make the vessels and utensils of our tables and side-hoards so elegant and pleasing that they approach the rank of works of art much more nearly than many which figure in famous galleries and are supposed to adorn them .
