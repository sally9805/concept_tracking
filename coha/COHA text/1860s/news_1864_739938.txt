txt The political surface in France is calm for the moment , and the Government seems anxious to maintain the public mind in this disposition , for the official journal takes pains to contradict the reports of military preparations , and of concentrations of troops in the direction of the Rhine . But the obstinacy and the internal quarrels of the Germans give great satisfaction in France , and the Emperor can not feel otherwise than contented at the turn German affairs are taking . One of the preoccupations of the moment at Paris is the speech of Prince NAPOLEON , delivered at the Suez Canal Banquet . The public in France are be ? ginning to recognize In the Prince a man of more than ordinary talent , and this remarkable improvise . Hon in favor of the famous Canal project , adds materially to his oratorical reputation . The arrival of the Dew Mexican Emperor at Paris is now put down for the middle of March . The vote of the municipalities In Mexico does not , in fact , arrive as rapidly as was expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is said here that one of the reasons which urge the Prince to take the bold step he has , is that he owes in Austria , in bona fide debts , something like eight millions of francs , which his brother refuses to pay , and which he hopes to obtain from Mexico . The Confederate privateer Florida , after all her boasting about being a man-of ? war , and about defying the Kearsage to mortal combat , seems to have run out of the port of Brest on the evening of the 10th inst. , at 9 o'clock at night , and under the protection of an obscurity which prevented the Kearsags from seeing or pursuing her . I had already predicted that his would be the most probable termination of the affair . Two thick brochures on the American question have just been issued from the press in this city , and both strongly in favor of the North . The first is by Mr. F. W. SARGENT , of Philadelphia , and is entitled , The Confederate States and Slavery , 176 pages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is by M. HENRI MOREAU , and is entitled , French Policy in America , 1861-1864 , 250 pages , press of DENTE ! . In the telegraphic dispatch which came through from Cork by the last New-York steamer , was an item which received extensive European circulation and which excited great surprise in political circles at Paris , stating that , according to the New-York Tribune , Mr. DAYTON was about to be recalled from Paris to give place to Gen. FREMONT . As Mr , DAYTON 'S position at the French Court is a very high one , this announcement naturally created surprise , and it is useless to say , was calculated to do our Minister much harm , and to diminish his usefulness . It is to be supposed , therefore , that the writer in the Tribune had some more serious motive tor making this injurious statement than that of simply giving relief to another name , for there is a question of patriotism concerned as well as a question of personalities . Or , perhaps , the writer did not calculate on receiving the honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor of Clinical Medicine at the School of Paris , Dr. TROUSSEAU , has lately described in a series of five lectures at the Hotel Dieu , a new and most interesting disease . That is to say , the disease is not a new one , but it now for the first time takes its nosological rank . After a long discussion between doctors , University men , philologists in general . and even Greeks . as to the etymology of the word most proper to characterize the malady , the Greek word Aphasia was adopted , but not until the various words alalia , amnesia , aphemia , aphrasia and anafdia , had been passed in review and eliminated . This richness of the Greek language in synonyms furnishes to the reader a ready indication of the character of the disease : it is a more or less complete loss of the power of speech . M. TROUSSEAU was not the first , in these series of lectures , to give the history of this singular and interesting affection ; it had already been brought to the notice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other names , by other professors . But a sufficient number of examples have now been collected to entitle the disease to a place In classical works under a distinct head , and that head the school of Paris has decided shall be aphasia . In this ; malady there remains an Integrity of the understanding and a normal condition of the vocal cords . Thus , while preserving all his mental aptitudes and all his intellectual wants , a man may be sequestered for weeks from his fellow  --  creatures . although living in the midst of them , and remaining in everything their equal with the exception of the use of his tongue . Dr. Lonna ; Professor at Montpellier , describes his own case . After a period of mental agitation and of strange nervous symptoms , accompanied by an access of tonsillitis , ( to which he was subject , ) he suddenly , although convalescing from his indisposition , found himself deprived of the power of speech . During the first weeks of the malady the patient had only lost the external part of the function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , remained intact . He was capable of performing the same amount of mentallabor as before his illness , in fact the mental and physical condition was completely restored , only he could not talk . But gradually in losing the recollection of the signification of words pronounced , he lost also the recollection of their visible signs . Finally , syntax disappeared from the words ; the alphabet remained , but the junction of letters for the formation of words had to be restudied . He was in despair at not being able to read the titles of his most familiar books without spelling them out , His despair , however , did not prevent him from smiling over the absurdity of French orthography . After a few weeks of profound melancholy he perceived one day , to his great joy , that tie could read at a distance the titles of the books in his library . From this time forward memory and speech returned , but only fast enough to enable him to notice a change every fortnight . As in other cases , when he first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while said invariably " handkerchief " for " book . " The recovery became finally complete . This occurred in 1842 , and Dr. LORDAT called the disease alalte , or anin6sie verbale , Among the dozen authentic cases of aphasia on record , Dr. ' ROUSSEAU related , at greater length than I can here give , the history of the following singular cases . A lady at Boulogne , who was known for her volubility , and especially for her sharpness of language , was seized suddenly with aphasia . The circumstance w as soon known throughout the city , and as she was detested by her servants and neighbors , her affliction was regarded as a punishment sent from Heaven . Her servants were rejoiced , tor she who had scolded and stormed so much was now reduced to the pronunciation of four words , and those four words , to add to the severity of her humiliation , were the most terrible oath in the French language : S ? n ? de D. No matter what she desired to say , even if it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she get out of her mouth . So that at the end of a year or two she was known throughout the city by the soubriquet of Madame S ? n ? de D. During all this time she remained in perfect health , and conducted her affairs with the same intelligence as before her attack of aphasia . Another lady , during convalesence from an erysipelas of the face , attended with delirium and grave nervous symptoms , lost , to the great alarm of her friends , the power of speech . As her recovery advanced , however , she began to pronounce a few words , but these were always a repetition of those she heard . As for example , when asked , " Will you have a drink ? " she replied , " Will you have a drink ? " Thus the sound of the words awakened in her mind the memory of the word heard , and in ' some sort opened up the furrows in which were concealed the terms of her natural tongue . A lady friend then commenced her education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to say , by giving her a word and making her study up all the words which this one recalled , she Succeeded , by several months ' patient labor , in recomposing her language and her intelligence . This , however , M. TROUSSEAU did not pronounce a case of pure aphasia , since there was here a delirium and a loss of intellikence . Of two men now in the wards of M. TROUSSEAU at the Hotel Dieu Hospital ; both can pronounce a few words , but these words are not those they desire to pronounce . One of them thus far has been only able to say couci , couci , ei , while the other when asked , " How are you ? " replies , " Yes ; " or ' 6 How old are you ? " replies " Mamma , " or " Do you suffer any where ? " replies again " Mamma . " Thus It is continually " Yes " or " Mamma , " to all questions . When asked to write his name on a slate he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when asked to write his two familiar words " Yes , Mamma , " he wrote again " Herm DENIER . " Other peculiarities not less striking than these were observed in the other cases related by Dr. TROUSSEAU . In his conclusions he declared that the cases of aphasia pure , that Is to say , cases in which there was loss of speech without appreciable lesion of the brain , were much more rare than those with lesion of the brain . A discussion is now going on as to the seat of this malady , a discussion which naturally brings up the interminable question as to the location in the brain of the function of speech . M. BROCA contends . with a formidable array of evidence , that this function is located , not in the frontal portion of the brain , as generally supposed , but in the posterior part of the third convolution . M. TROUSSEAU combats this theory . The discussion on the question of spontaneous gen eration at the Academy of Sciences , one of the questions which has occupied the most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is hoped , about to receive a solution . M. POUCHET , the indefatigable propagator of the theory of spontaneous generation , was defied by several of his colleagues of the Academy to submit his experiments to a committee of the Academy , and this challenge was accepted by him in the following words : " I declare that from whatever part of the globe I may take a cubic decimetre of air , from the moment I shall put this air in contact with a pretrescible liquor contained In a retort hermetically sealed , constantly this retort will be filled with living organisms . " Messrs . Jot : and Mussel ' , two other members of the Academy who also believe in their power of generating animal life spontaneously , accepted the challenge in the following terms ; " If a single one of our retorts remains unaltered , we will loyally avow our defeat . " The President named the following distinguished men as the committee for witnessing and verifying these important experiments : Messrs . FLOURENp , DUMAS , BitooNIART , MILNE  --  EDWARDS and BALARD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life is an accident or a creation . What a sublime humiliation is reserved for the proud race of men who now inhabit this earth , if M. POUCHIT and his friends can prove that an animal  --  and if an animal why not a man ? ? can be generated in a chemist 's retort ? Man an accident ? Have we strutted and fussed , and made much of ourselves these six thousand years , to come at last to this ! The School of Medicine is in a state of ebullition on account of Government inter ference in its affairs . A year ago , the Dean of the Faculty , Baron P.m , DuBois , who had arrived at this dignity by the law of rotation , was removed by the Emperor arbitrarily , and replaced by Dr. Rime . The pretext urged was that the school of Paris lacked initiative , that it was losing prestige , that more progress was being made in science elsewhere than at Paris , and this notwithstanding , the school never contained so many distinguished professors at any one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either for Messrs . DUBOIS or RATER , for both are equally popular at Professors , the Latin Quarter opposed this intervention of the Government as a grave infringement on the prerogatives of the school , and an organized opposition to hi . RATER was gotten up with the intention of forcing him to resign . This ob ject has been accomplisned ; RATER was given to understand by a thousand various demonstrations in and out of the School that resistance was impossible , and that notwithstanding the useful measures he had decreed , lie would stand as the principal obstacle to the execution , not only of his own decrees , but to the general interests of the School . M. TARDIEU , Professor of Legal Medicine , has been appointed Dean in M. RATER 'S place , and this appointment , made on the recommendation of the School , is generally accepted . Dr.TARDIEU fills also the functions of Coroner to the Municipality , and is a man of great activity and superior administrative ability . M. TARDIEU is the author of a work In three volumes on Hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of legal medicine . He is little known , however , to the profession out of Paris .
