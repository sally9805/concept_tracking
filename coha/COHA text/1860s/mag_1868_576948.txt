THE LAST OF THE BOURBON STORY . 2 Gs*crr . Here comes the Lady iPaulina 's steward ; he can deliver you more . how goes it now , sir ? this news which is called true , is so like an old tale , that the verity of it is in strong suspicion . Has the king found his heir ? 3 GENT . Most true ; if ever truth were pre*nant hy circumstance ; that , which you hear , you 'll swear you see , there is such unity in the proofs . The mantle of Queen Hermione - her jewel ahont the neck of it :  --  the letters of Antigonus , found with it , which they know to he his character : - the majesty of the creature , in resemhlance of the mother :  --  the affection of nohieness , which nature shows above her ( his ) hreeding , and many other evidences , proclaim her ( him ) , with all certainty to he the king 's daughter ( son ) . WINTER 'S TALE , Act V , Scene 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced on the public mind by the article in Putnam 's Mionthly , of February , 53 , on the claims of the Rev. Eleazar Williams to be regarded as the Dauphin of France , followed , as the article was , by others with further proof . It was an interest which did not have to reach its height through gradual periods of growth . It sprang forth Minerva-like , and secured itself at once ti prominent place in the newspapers , and among the current topics of conversation . In all parts of the country the question , " Have we a Bourbon among us l " divided the community ; and there were few intelligent persons who did not range themselves on one side or the other . The interest was probably due to several causes . France was just then drawing the world 's attention to herself by re-establishing the empire under Napoleon III. , while the Count of Chambord was protesting in behalf of his legitimate Bourbon claims . Then , the matter had just enough raciness in it to make us keenly interested in what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should have weighed our decision more carefully , and tested more anxiously the grounds on which it was formed , had it involved a change of rulers for ourselves . Then , part of the interest was due to Mr. Hanson 's clever and evidently honest advocacy ; and part to the contrast between the manner of Mr. Williams ' previous life , and the position to which , if the claims were true , he was entitled , and out of which he had long been defrauded . But great as the interest was , it subsided , after a little while , as quickly as it arose . For a time the newspaper paragraphists thought it worth their while to chronicle the movements of Mr. Williams ; ladies sought an introduction to his royal presence ; curiosityhunters begged his autograph . But , for some time before Mr. Williams ' death , ten yeas ago , and ever since , there has been a profound indifference as to the whole subject . Nor was this surprising , because nothing arose to feed or prolong the interest ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does not press itself before the public eye . And yet we can hardly believe-so utterly careless are we now as to the merits or issue of the question , so vague have become our impressions of the points which Mr. Hanson so tellingly made-that , besides creating so deep and general an interest in this country and even in Europe , besides securing the adhesion of men of calm judgment and profound historical acumen , such , for instance , as the late Hon. John C. Spencer , IRev . Dr. Hawks , and Dr. Francis ; besides all this , the matter was made the subject of diplomatic communications between foreign ministers here and their governments abroad . And , of course , whatever truth there was in the claim , the subsequent silence has made nothing against it . If the considerations put forth by Mr. Williams were valid , they are as true now as when he was a nameless Indian missionary in the West . But kings , like the gods , play with loaded dice ; the possessors of power can smile compassionately // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if in Mr. Williams the last of the elder line of the ancient Bourbon race expired , it adds but one more to the already long list of lost princes who have died in obscurity and poverty . After the lapse of so many years since his death , circumstances recently threw into our hands his papers , which had lain in the meantime in the house in Hogansburgh where he died . And while they may not do much to confirm his royal claims , they cast many side lights upon a history which is strange and interesting . The papers filled six or eight cases , and had been kept with admirable care ; and besides including a journal of a larger part of his life , and copies of all his letters apparently , furnished such copious memoranda as would enable one to gain a clear view of his interior life and opinions . The disputed period of his life is that previous to his fifteenth year , when , in the year 1800 , he , with his reputed brother , was brought from Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his history is that he was the son of Thomas Williams , who was the grandson of Eunice Williams , the " Fair Captive , " who , with her father , the Rev. John Williams , was carried prisoner to Canada at the capture of Deerfield in 1704 , and who married an Indian , and spent the rest of her life in Canada . Mr. Hanson , in his work , " The Lost Prince , " has elaborated to a larger extent than it would be interesting to follow him the probabilities of Mr. Williams ' identity with the Dauphin , Louis Charles , the son of Louis XVI. , who had been supposed to have died in the Temple in 1795 . While there have ever been doubts hanging about the question as to whether the child that died in the Temple was indeed the Dauphin , or whether the Dauphin was conveyed away , and a moribund child put in his place ; the records of the Temple have such an apparent completeness and force as to establish as firmly as any ordinary matter of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still there are facts , as , for instance , the issue of police orders for the watching of the frontiers immediately after the reported death of the Dauphin , for the stopping of suspected persons , and the actual arrest of one person thought to be the Prince ; the absence of the Dauphin 's name in the funeral solemnities of the Royal Family at the Restoration ; and the evident unwillingness of the government to accord an investigation , although desired , into the claims of the pretender Naundorif ; all of which cast an uncertainty over the matter , and seem to invite the inquiry whether the Dauphin really did die in 1795 , and then , whether Mr. Williams might not have been the Dauphin . There is enough doubt to give zest to the investigation . An article in the Philadelphia Aurora , of October 29 , 1811 , states that a curious rumor was afloat in England , that the Dauphin was alive , and that a person had lately arrived in that country who knew where he resided , and had communicated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchess d'Angoul*me in 1853 , in New Orleans , testified also that her mistress at about the same time believed her brother to be alive . Now , supposing that the Dauphin was rescued from the Temple in 1795 , is there any evidence that Mr. Williams and the Dauphin were the same person ? If the claim was false , Mr. Williams was a half-breed Indian ; and the deception , which was so clever as to enlist the earnest support of many good scholars , and proficients in the knowledge of httman nature , was doubly remarkable , in view of the antecedents of its originator . The fact of the European type of countenance which Mr. Williams had , does not conclude the matter ; because , if he was the son of Thomas Williams , he would have had a large proportion of white blood in his veins . His great grandmother Eunice married an Indian ; but her daughter married an Englishman ; and it was that daughter 's son who was the father of Eleazar . It was // entirely possible , therefore , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features . And yet he undoubtedly did resemble in many of his features the Bourbon family . Not to mention the strong testimony of Dr. Francis and the artist Fagnani , there is a letter among his papers from Mr. Thos . H. White , of Philadelphia , from which the following is an extract : There is residing . in Burlington , New Jersey , a member of the society of Friends , Stephen Grelet ; he was formerly an officer in the French service ; has seen Louis XVL On being shown your likeness , without being told who it was taken for , and asked merely if it resembled any one whom he knew , he replied , " I see no likeness in it to any one but Louis XVI. , , And the coincidence of the fact , and the position of the cicatrized and scrofubus scars on the body of the Dauphin and of Mr. Williams , is a remarkable circumstance . Two tests of the genuineness of his claims occurred to every one , when he put forth his pretensions : the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mother , of course , would know whether Eleazar was her son or not . But she was an Indian , and did not understand English , and so could only be approached through an interpreter . Mr. Williams said that , as she was a Roman Catholic and he a Protestant , the priests had induced her , from consideration for the Church 's interests , to be silent on the subjecf , that she would give no answer whatever to questions concerning Eleazar . Somewhat later , however , in the midst of the discussions concerning his claims , an affidavit appeared signed by his mother declaring positively that Eleazar was her son , and that the scars on his knees came from sores which he brought home with him from school . Still later another affidavit of Mrs. Williams appeared , contradicting much of the former affidavit , and in which Elcazar is mentioned indirectly as her adapted son . In giving this affidavit Mr. Hanson makes no mention of Mr. Williams ' connection with it , but says that it was uttered freely by Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What surprised us , therefore , in looking over the papers was to find several memoranda in Mr. Wilhams ' handwriting in English , which showed that the affidavit had really been composed by him . There were rough copies containing erasures and interlineations , showing how the affidavit had been made up , and all indicating an apparent purpose to steal the desired avowal of his adoption from his mother , without making too broad an issue . In order , therefore , to get at the truth of the matter , we wrote to the Justice before whom both of the affidavits were sworn , and desired him to relate the circumstances , as he remembered them . His answer was as follows : The first affadavit was made under the following circumstances . Rev. Mr. Marcoux of St. Regis came to my office at the time the atfadavit is dated , and said that he had been requested by the editor of some French paper , published in New York , to ascertain from the mother of Mr. Williams whether there was any reason to suppose that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marcoux , and I think one or two other persous . Mr. Mar. coux acted as interpreter . Mrs. Williams did not speak or understand English . The affadavit was drafted by me , and so far as I could judge by the little knowledge I have of the Indian language , she was truly and correctly interpreted , and spoke in that affadavit as she wished to be understood . The second affadavit was taken at the hotel , Mr. Williams and another gentleman with Antoine Barrow , the interpreter , being present . I had no particular knowledge of the matter until called in to take the affadavit , when I found the parties above named , with Mrs. Williams , in the room , and a discussion going on between Mr. Williams and Barrow about the meaning of an Indian word which was to make the mother say that he was adopted . I took the affadavit made by Mrs. Williams , but I never thought that she intended to say that Eleazar was an adopted son , but she seemed very much surprised that he should claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always her answer , except in this single instance . I have never believed she understood the word , or intended to say what she was mads to say in the last affadavit . I think that you will find it rather artfully drawn , and that it does not present such an appearance of truth and frankness as the first . Certainly , if I am mistaken in this view , it was very forcibly impressed on // my mind by the circumstances under which the two affadavits were taken . It seems , therefore , clear that Mrs ; Williams desired to say that Eleazar was her son . She might or might not be uttering the truth ; but such was her declaration . It therefore fares badly with Mr. Williams ' credibility to find him writing to the Rev. Mr. Hale that " his mother was justly indignant at the statement " ( that Eleazar was not the son of Louis XVI. , but was her son ) , " and calls the utterer of it a dishonest villain and a liar , to invent such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , true that Eleazar 's name does not appear among those of the other children of Thomas Williams on the baptismal register at Qtughnawaga . This is certainly surprising , considering the carefulness of the Roman Catholics in the matter of the baptism of their children . The names of all the other children are there except Eleazar 's . The , perhaps insufficient , reason for the omission , given by the mother and the priest , was that the child was weakly , and was baptized privately , and , in consequence , no record was kept . But the statement made by Mr. Williams to Mr. Hanson , that " the births of the children follow so closely upon each other in regular intervals of two years each , that it does not seem naturally possible I could have been her child , " is hardly borne out by the record . Mrs. Williams says that Eleazar was her fourth child ; and the births follow , according to the baptismal register , at these intervals ; 1780 , 1781 , 1786 , 1791 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; so that , at the time named by Mrs. Williams , there is an unusual interval , in which , in order to preserve the regularity , it is possible , perhaps , likely , that a child was born . The baptismal register , on the evidence in which Mr. Williams so greatly depended , is not , therefore , conclusive in his favor . When appealed to as regards his memory of his early life , Mr. Williams said that his life , up to within a short time before he went to Massachusetts in 1800 , was to him a blank , that a few floating images in his mind was all that he retained . The immediate cause of the return to him of reason was , he said , a fall into the waters of Lake George from a high rock up to . which he had clambered . So that , presuming that Mr. Williams was honest , all hope of gaining any clue to the truth from his memory was at an end . A circumstance is told by Mr. Hanson , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of those many slight , concurring incidents that rendered his plea for Mr. Williams so apparently conclusive ; but which an examination of original documents proves to be false . He says that , while Eleazar and his reputed brother were together in Massachusetts being educated , and while the expenses for his brother 's education were altogether a charge upon the benevolent , part of the means for Eleazar's. support was furnished from an unknown source . Now we have before us the package of original bills and appropriations , and no such distinction is anywhere apparent . It is absolutely certain that Eleazar , like his brother , was educated wholly at the charge of certain benevolent societies in Massachusetts , with a view to future ministry among the Indians . There is not the slightest appearance of mystery . Mr. Hanson quotes the authority of an Albany newspaper for the statement that Mr. Bleecker of that city was the agent for Mr. Jourdan , and supplied Thomas Williams with money for the education of the foreign boy . But I have before me the copy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under a fictitious name to the Albany Knickerbocker , which is the origin of all the assertions which Mr. Hanson says came from an undoubted source . For all we can gather to the contrary they came from Mr. Williams ' imagination , as no authority whatever is referred to . After completing his education in Massachusetts , and after his participation as ranger in the second war , in which he was wounded , Mr. Williams , in 1816 , commenced his work among the Indians at Oneida ; and , five years - *II * // later , emigrated with a part of the tribe to Green Bay , Wisconsin , near which place he continued to reside until 1850 , when he returned East . As early as 1822 a disposition appeared in Mr. Williams , which continued to manifest itself ever afterwards , to engage in genealogical researches . In that year he writes to a relative that he is about to prepare a life of Solomon Williams , and desires documents . In 1845 he assisted in preparing a memoir of his great grandmother Eunice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses on the two hundredth anniversary of the death of the Rev. John Williams . At this time , too , he began to collect accounts of Indian history , manners , and traditions . In 1823 numerous letters indicate that he had become known in New York , Philadelphia , Boston , and Hartford as an authority in Indian matters . Letters of inquiry from the Rev. Dr. Jarvis , Mrs. Sigourney , Mr. Cope , and others , were answered with such fulness as to indicate that he had already made fair progress in what he afterwards continued ,  --  inquiries as to the labors of the early French missionaries among the Indians , and the travels and discoveries of La Salle , Hennepin and Marquette . And at a date no later than 1826 the following extract from the Hampshire Gazette is found in his journal , and may indicate the drift of his mind : WELSH JNnTANs. - The Welsh have a tradition that one of their princes , by the name of Madoc , sailed from Wales about the year liZO , with 300 men , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America , and report that a tribe of white Indians , who speak the Welsh language , now inhabit some part of the country west of the Mississippi . In December , 1822 , a gentleman in Wales wrote a letter to Rev. E. Chapman , one of the American missionaries stationed among the Osages , requesting information respecting a tribe of Indians inhabiting the Rocky Mountains , near Santa Fe , and furnished him with a small vocabulary of Welsh words , to ascertain whether these Indians had any knowledge of the Welsh language . Mr. Chapman , iu his reply , states that he had been informed by a party of hunters that the NEzra , joes , a singular people , live in the midst of the mountains northwest of Santa Fe ; that they cultivate all kinds of vegetables ; possess herds of cattle , horses , sheep , &amp;c. ; do not live in villages , but on their plantations ; manufacture various articles of clothing ; and dress unlike all other Indians . The men cultivate the earth and tend the flocks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , and their own native priest , and refuse to admit the Spanish clergy . Their weapons resemble those of the ancient Britons . Mr. C. had found no opportunity to compare their language with the Welsh . There is very little probability , in our opinion , that these Indians will turn out to be the descendants of Madoc and his friends . There is no more reason to suppose that they have derived some of the arts of civilized life , and some knowledge of Christianity from their neighbors , the Spaniards. - Ham*s7*ire Gazette . From the time of Mr. Williams ' removal from New York began that course which was the bane of all his after life , lie became mixed up in the temporal affairs of the Indians , and in a short time was but little else than a hanger on about the committee rooms and departments at Washington . This so secularized his character , and to this he so subordinated his clerical duties that , within two or three years after his removal West , his missionary stipend was withdrawn , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems to have rendered only occasional ministerial services , and his thoughts are wholly absorbed in the prosecution of Indian claims . It would be needless to enumerate all the schemes which kept him constantly in or near Washington , watching the varying fortunes of his petitions ; but laments over the worldliness of his mind , and conjectures as to the success of his suits before Congress form , daring this period the staple of his journal . After being fi*ttered with many delusive hopes , he met at length , on the whole , with the fate of all federal claimants . He secured some appropriations for the Indians , out of which considerable sums had to be deducted for his expenses . But he became poorer and poorer , until , in 1850 , he had no foot left to stand upon in the West . He had been called to account for ministerial // irregularities by the Bishop of New York , and the Bishop of Wisconsin ; arid the Boston missionary society , of which he had latterly become a stipendiary , received a complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only wanted money . And the cause of it all , as he confesses in his journal , was his absorption in secular affairs . He had been drawn into the vortex at Washington , and , in waiting for his claims to be allowed , he lost his ministerial devotion , and all his property besides . With a single exception , in either his letters , or journals , or papers , we see not the slightest mention of his royal claims until the year 1848 . That exception is the single entry in one place in his journal in 1841 of his interview with Prince de Joinville , and the reported disclosure of his royal bii*th made to him then . Certain it is that there is n* other allusion to this most stupendous revelation of his origin in any other form for seven years after it was said to have been made . And no person has been found to whom , during this interval , Mr. Williams spoke of the strange history . He explains this silence by saying that he was incredulous as to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until afterwards revived by further circumstances . Certainly , the difficulty of assigning a motive for such gratuitous disclosures to an obscure missionary on the part of the Prince , whose father was then in apparently secure possession of the throne of France , was always an inexplicable point in Mr. Williams ' story . And it is no small task to harmonize Mr. Williams ' refusal of such splendid offers as he says were then made to him with his extreme poverty at the time , and the toughening of scruple which must have been induced in him by so long contact with the influences at Washington . Moreover , the political sentiments put into the Prince 's mouth during the interview , more especially the remarks relative to the connection between the French Revolution and the misfortunes of Louis XVI. , and the aid rendered by France to us during our own Revolutionary struggle , are found in almost identical words among Mr. Williams ' papers at a date long anterior to his interview with the Prince . It is , of course , unquestionable that the Prince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him . But , as we have seen , Mr. Williams had long been known in the Eastern cities as one versed in those subjects of early French history in this country in which the Prince would naturally be interested . And nothing would be more obvious than that he should have had Mr. Williams ' name given to him , and that , when he went West , he should have inquired for Mr. Williams . This is the Prince 's version of the matter ; and the likelihood of its truth is certified by the following circumstance . Immediately after parting from each other , at the Prince 's suggestion , Mr. Williams prepared and sent to the Prince in New York some information about La Salle and Charlevoix . The reception of this information the Prince courteously acknowledges through his secretary ; but there is not the slightest intimation of any occult matter between them . In 1843 Mr. Williams , in the name of his Indian brethren , sends a request to the King of the French , through the Prince , for some books of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the King has complied with the request and sends the books . On account of interruptions in mail communications the letter and the box remain for a little time in New York ; and , when they are forwarded , the Consul General of France in a note says that he " was unable before to present to Mr. Williams the enclosed letter and the box of books sent by the King of the French . " On these words , in order to heighten Mr. Williams ' importance , and as an additional voucher for his claims , the assertion is founded that the King thought Mr. Williams worthy of an autograph letter , which was lost . The letter referred to is , of course , that of the Prince 's secretary . A copy of Mr. Williams ' reply to this // PuT*AM 's MAGiZINE. lies before me ; and , in order to sliow how inconsistent its tone is with the disclosures asserted to have been made by the Prince , the following extract will suffice : So well pleased am I with the books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Highness ' benevolence and friendship , as to embolden me to appear before him as a suppliant for a similar favor . For years I have been desirous to acquaint myself with the writings of the French , either in civil or ecclesiastical histories , as well as in theology . If it is not asking and intruding too much upon your Royal Highness ' goodness , may I hope that he will give a favorable hearing to my humble request . From these facts , which theory seems to be more likely ; - that they had had a friendly communication together on historical subjects ; or that the Prince had revealed to Mr. Williams the awful intelligence that he was the rightful King of France , and he was himself his subject ? ' The journal in which the circumstances of the Prince 's visit are narrated consists of sheets stitched loosely together ; and it would be entirely possible to interpellate new matter into it , or indeed to write it wholly over . The New York Gourrier des Etats Unis in February , 1854 , says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Buffalo , Mr. Geo . H. Haskins , who affirms that nearly two years before the journey of the Prince de Joinville to the United States , Mr. Williams had confided to him , under the seal of the most profound secrecy , that he was not what he appeared to be , and that he was in reality the Dauphin of France . As proof on this point , Mr. Williams showed Mr. Haskins an engraved portrait of Marie Antoinette , that he might judge of the resemblance between them , and also a small copper medal*of devotion , such as the Indians wear about the neck , and not having any connection with any historical medal of the reign of Louis XVI . The story included all the imaginary circumstances that Mr. Hanson has collected ,  --  the idiocy of early infancy , the sanative fall into Lake George , and the resi dence of his guardian in New Orleans . This interview , adds Mr. Haskins , took place in Buffalo , partly in my father 's office , and partly at the Farmer 's Hotel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not remember the precise date , I can affirm most positively that this conversation took place more than a year and a half before Mr. Williams ' meeting with the Prince de Joinville . " In connection with this , the fact appears from his journal that Mr. Williams was in Buffalo at about that time ; and that he was in the habit of lodging at the Farmer 's Hotel . If this testimony be true , it indicates that Mr. Williams did not derive his first impressions of his royal origin from the Prince , but that he had been brooding over the matter long before . It also goes far to cast distrust over all Mr. Williams ' assertions . Furthermore , it is noticeable that , although much inquired after , no original medals or documents of any kind were ever produced by Mr. Williams . Subsequently he said that he had received letters from several French bishops and one cardinal , and also one from the secretary of the present Emperor , all inquiring into his history . But when these , or any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always declared that they had been lost , or burnt , or been mysteriously stolen . And while to one person Mr. Williams says that he immediately answered the Emperor 's letter , to another he writes that he has refused to notice it . But , in 1848 , Mr. Williams says that he received a letter from Thos . Kimball , of Baton Rouge , informing him that an aged French gentleman had just died in New Orleans , who , on his death-bed , had broken the oath of silence which he had long before been forced to take ; and that he had declared that it was he who had brought the Dauphin to this country , and had placed him among the Indians , and that the Dauphin was none other than Eleazar Williams . Now , in the first place , there are two copies of this journal among Mr. Wil 96 // hams ' papers ; and the copy from which Mr. Hanson wrote is evidently the later transcript ; and it differs in several remarkable particulars from the earlier copy . Some things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a change of the words " New Orleans or Havana , " for " New Orleans and Helena ; " and there is nothing about Yanderheyden , of Albany , in the first copy . Then , while this is all the information which the journal gives , and Mr. Williams states that lie derived all his information on this subject from this letter of Mr. Kimball 's ; in another part of Mr. Williams ' papers we have a most elaborate , extra-historical account of the circumstances under which the oath was taken by Bellanger in France , the name of the bishop who administered it , " &amp;c . Then , while Mr. Hanson , in April , 1853 ( Putnam 's , p. 450 ) , says that " at the time that his previous article was prepared ( January , 1853 ) , Mr. Williams was not a*vare that any person named Bellanger was known historically to have been in communication with the Dauphin during the last hours spent in the Temple , " I have before me a statement written by Mr. Williams lefore 1850 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brave and humane Bellanger who had charge of the Dauphin arrived at Lake George , " &amp;c . I know not how we can extricate Mr. Williams in such a case without concluding that he was deceiving Mr. Hanson . Then , finally , although Mr. Kimball is spoken of as an acquaintance of Mr. Williams in the first copy of the journal ,  --  not in , the last , the published copy ,  --  we never meet with any mention of him before or after in his life . Inquiries were naturally put to Mr. Williams as to where this person was ; but he never answered them . And , although Mr. Hanson searched diligently in New Orleans , he could find no trace whatever of the death of any such Frenchman as Mr. Kimball mentions . But from this time , 1848 , paragraphs began to appear in various newspapers , in New York , Philadelphia , Buffalo , Albany , and other places , respecting VOL . IL-7 Mr. Williams ' claims . They spoke of Mr. Williams in the third person , and purported to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public mind was being educated to wonder who this person was , and what truth there was in his claims . But , in reality , under whatever names these articles were sent to the publishers , they all emanated from Mr. Williams himself . And this manner of writing anonymously , or under an assumed name , and as though great facts were held in reserve , was a method by which ever aftcrward Mr. Williams kept himself before the public eye . I quote one letter , out of many which could be given , as a specimen , written in December , 1848 , to the Rev. Mr. Clark , of Manlius , New York ; and this is in hr . Williams ' handwrit-ing : May I add here , to what I have already stated of Mr. Williams ' origin , that there is certainly a mystery in the birth and descent of this man . The register of the baptisms of the family of his reputed father in Canada , which I have received within a few days past from the priest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family of Thomas Williams . There are circumstances apparently strong in their nature which indnce me to think that Mr. Williams is the Dauphin , or Louis XVII. of France . And I have before me a letter written in July , 1848 , to Mr. E. Irving , of New York , thanking him for the trouble which he had been at in going to half a dozen offices before he could get the notice of the Dauphin published . A strong point made by Mr. Hanson in Mr. Williams ' hehalf was that , so far from bringing his claims before the public , Mr. Williams had been strongly averse to it . The facts which I have given prove the contrary . It is noticeable that , in these earlier publications , the point which Mr. Williams insists upon mainly is the absence of his name from the register at Caughuawaga , and the proof that he finds therein that he is not Thos . Williams ' son . He barely alludes to the Prince 's visit and Kimball 's letter , and asks what these must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work up the antecedent probabilities , // 95 PUTNAM 'S MAo*&amp;zINz. and to elaborate and multiply the proofs . At length , in July , 1849 , an article appeared in the United States Magazine which purported to be a review of a life of the Dauphin written by Mr. H. B. Ely . But the book had no existence outside of the review , and , although I can not say positively that the article was written by Mr. Williams , yet it is very much in his style ; and , certainly , no such person as Mr. H. B. Ely ever appeared afterward in the controversy , although inquired after . But the article served its purpose as a point d'appui , to which Mr. Williams could refer inquirers , and on which Mr. Williams could support , what was then the more important consideration to him , his claims before Congress . A letter sent under another name , but in Mr. Williams ' handwriting , is before me , addressed to a member , in which he refers to the articles concerning Mr. Williams ' high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , on the strength of them , and of the assistance rendered to the United States by his reputed father , Louis XVI. , a strong speech were made , it could hardly fail to help on his suit . In a letter written in October , 1850 , to a gentleman in this city , while he urges the expediency of throwing out occasional paragraphs in the papers about his claims , he only refers to them as they may help on his case before Congress . Indeed in several letters he urges his friends to keep his name and the subject before the public . And in this anonymous way , with a view to its influencing matters at Washington , with as many men in buckram as he chose to personate , the agitation was kept up until the time when Mr. Hanson commenced his investigations . Thus in August t850 , Mr. Williams wrote , under an assumed name , of course , to a Mr. Reed of Buffalo . It so happened that I was at the Eagle Hotel , in Philadelphia , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . Curiosity , as well as having taken an interest in the history of the unfortunate Prince , has led me to address you , and ask you to have the goodness to inform me if you are in peasession of any historical facts in relation to this wonderful man . But a new direction and spirit were imparted to the subject when Mr. Hanson took the matter up . Whatever Mr. Williams ' disposition was , Mr. Hanson entered into the subject con amore and pursued it with the honest energy which characterized his nature . No hope of ulterior advantages were needed to stimulate the search ; Mr. Hanson believed that Mr. Williams was indeed the Dauphin ; that he had been grossly wronged ; and he determined to befriend his suit . And the effect of the change is as manifest , immediately , in looking over the papers , as is the relief in going out of a fetid atmosphere into the open air . The anonymous paragraphs and correspondence under assumed names now cease , and the royal claims are put forth avowedly . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the West that in 1850 he came East to endeavor to engage his services to certain parties for the removal of the Senecas from the Indian territory to the upper waters of the Mississippi . But , as his overtures were declined , and he was bidden to consider the correspondence closed , and as there was nothing left for him in Wisconsin , he went to St. Regis , in the northern part of this State , where a portion of his father 's tribe had a reservation , and commenced a school there . Then , as he shortly after received a missionary appointment from the Diocesan Society of New York , and the Boston Unitarian Society , and succeeded in procuring many subscriptions for his work , he made up his mind to remain in the East , and resume clerical duty . And this he was the more induced to do as there sprang up under his hand , directly he came East , a brood of new claims upon Congress and the Vermont Legislature which he could more conveniently prosecute at St. Regis . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ; nor had they , in spite of Mr. Williams ' representations to the contrary , even any faith in his royal aspirations . // 99 It is not our business to examine all the new considerations in behalf of Mr. Williams ' kingly claims which Mr. Hanson 's assiduity unearthed . Many of them exhaust themselves in proving that the Dauphin may not have died in 1795 ; whereas the further and more important question for us is whether the facts of Mr. Williams ' life , as revealed by his papers , go to show whether 1*e was the Dauphin , even granting that the Dauphin did not die in 1795 . We have passed in review the main grounds on which Mr. Williams rested his case ; the facts are as they have been stated ; the conclusion from them others may form . A noticeable feature as revealed by Mr. Williams ' papers is that , while at first , he rarely ever asserts his own confidence in his claims , his assurance seems to strengthen itself as the belief gained ground in others . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first articleia Putnam 's 3lontldy , during which time Mr. Hanson 's book appeared , and the controversy waxed hot on the subject , as Mr. Williams was flooded with compliments and communications , he came to believe himself a veritable prince in disguise . Notes are directed to him under the title of Louis XVII. , and he is addressed in them as " Your most gracious Majesty . " He signs himself with the royal cypher , " L. C. ; " he says that " he wishes to maintain the dignity of his family by manifesting at all times in his conduct that sense of honor which becomes his royal race ; " he confidently anticipates the time when he shall be called back to France to restore the government on its old basis ; he writes anonymously a communication for a newspaper , declaring that the Count de Chambcrd is investigating his claims , and that the Bourbon and Orleans branches are uniting in self-defence against him . He prepared also a royal manifesto in these words : It is due to ourselves to say that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , human rights , universal freedom , and the good of the race . And these sentiments have been strengthened and increased by the events of many years up to the present hour . We trust we have learned so much of the Gospel of the Son of God , that whenever an individual of the human race is found , we look upon that person as our brother , without regard to his rank or origin . We have hitherto enjoyed the quiet of a private and retired life ; we have no solicitude for a responsible station in the government . Nor are we insensible to the high trust and arduous responsibilities of the Chief Magistrate of a state . But should we be called to the high office which was formerly held by our ancestors , we shall endeavor so to discharge the duties of that station , as to show that the confidence reposed in us was not misplaced . What use he made of this paper it is impossible to say . He also declares in a letter to a gentleman in this city , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , he says , to all appearance are searching into the history of his life ; a fact which rests on no other authority than his word . Although it does not appear that he ever had any foreign correspondent , except , in that one instance , the Prince de Joinville , he writes to a friend that he " had lately received a communication from a respectable gentleman in France who is the nephew of Mr. Laurent , who attended upon the Dauphin for a time in the Temple . This aged gentleman , now eighty-four years old , states that he was the very person who took the Dauphin , in the night when the Dauphin was rescued , from the Temple , and bore him to a little boat in the river Seine , where he was received by friendly hands . " And in 1857 he says that a letter from Lyons had been sent , " in the care of the house of Cope , Philadelphia , " in which the following information was contained : Monsieur I- says , " With faltering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed ; on this low couch the sovereign of France was lying , under the effects ' of a powerful opiate . With a throbbing heart I stretched forth my arms ) and put one of them gently under his shoulders , and raised him up . Lend me some assistance for a moment , Monsieur , ' said I. We wrapped him in a large black mantle . The mightiest of the kings of Europe was now in our arms a helpless babe . We began to descend . At the second turn , // Who goes there ? ' was the challenge . Hearen and earth ! ' thought I , I have been deceived . ' But at the next moment the voice of the officer of the guard was heard , Pass , pass . ' " But this is not the only point at which information springs up conveniently for Mr. William 's benefit , which no previous historian had ever recorded . In a memoir of Louis XVI . and Marie , during their imprisonment , in Mr. Williams ' handwriting , we have this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnish . In the night following the baptism of the Dauphin , that is worthy of notice which is said to have happened to the queen in her sleep , in relation to the infant . She saw her child in manhood , and his dress was all black , and he was in the midst of a large concourse of people , whom he was addressing in the most forcible language , entreating them to obey the Word of God . When the queen related her nocturnal vision to the king and and other friends , it was done with an air of pleasantry ? " What , " she says , " will my son be a minister of religion ? Will he proclaim the faith of Christ in the fields ? For surely it was in the meadow where I saw him and the people , and he was in the dress of the Reformed ministers ! " And further , while even Mr. Hanson , after all his researches , leaves the manner of the Dauphin 's removal obscure , Mr. Williams conveniently furnishes a minute account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To effect the Dauphin 's liberation , every preparation had been made by the few active friends in Paris , upon whom a profound secrecy had been enjoined as necessary to the success of their perilous enterprise , and to the preservation of their own lives . The several parts assigned to the actors immediately at the Temple were most faithfully performed , and this gave a favorable turn to the whole movement . At two o'clock in the morning , the young Dauphin , wrapped up in a bed mattress , was conveyed to a house in the neighborhood , where he was dressed in clothes made for the journey , and thence to the carriage in which he and his attendants were to be carried to Flanders and Holland , and thence*to England . The Dauphin was in such a feeble state that his little remaining strength gave way as they were leaving the barriers of Paris ; and the attendants became alarmed lest he should expire in their arms . He fainted several times and ceased to breathe . Buton the application of restoratives he revived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Really , at this rate , the manufacture of history becomes the easiest thing in the world . But , by reason of his absorption in this matter , and the continued prosecution of his Indian claims at Washington , and the consequent absences from home , Mr. Williams ' duties became neglected to such an extent that his missionary stipend was withdrawn in 1855 . Just before this , too , his indefatigable friend , Mr. Hanson died ; and , while the Bourbon discussion brought him notoriety and some presents , it did not bring success to his suite before Congress , and Mr. Williams began to be in want , lie drew heavily upon the generosity of his friends ; but he never was very provident , and the Indians used to say , with regard to the money which he was soliciting for them , that " he had a hole in his pocket . " In 1856 he fancied that poison had been administered to him by foreign emissaries either in Philadelphia or in this city , the effects of which poison he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1858 , the public prints gave out that Mr. Williams had narrowly escaped assassination at Washington . In writing to a friend , Mr. Williams gives the following account of the affair : For more than two years I have been warned by my friends in the Atlantic cities to be careful , and not walk out in the evenings without an attendant . I was informed in Washington that the French Emperor had agents and spies all over the country , under pretence of seeking after those who had attempted his life . The police of the city was doubled in the vicinity of my residence . In the night of the affair my spirit was raised to the highest pitch in defence of my life . I fell upon my antagonist like a furions lion , drove him from one corner of the room to the other , until I wrested the instrument of death from his hands . He then fled , and left the dagger on the floor , and it is now in my possession . How much of this was fact , and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet , in this connection , it is but just to give Mr. Hanson 's // narrative of a strange occurrence which happened to him in April , 1854 : I have had a call from C- . lie behaved very strangely , and whether he wanted to assassinate me , or to make some bona fide proposition from Henry V. , I do not know , but it was one or the other . He called about halfpast seven in the morning , stayed to breakfast , and remained some hours after . To keep the door shut seemed his great anxiety , and he would come close up to me with hand behind his back , and something apparently wrapped up in his pockct handkerchief . And though I repeatedly put the table , or the distance of the room between us , he would follow me and come up as close as possible . So , finding I could not avoid him , I improved upon his example , moved still closer to him , and looked him in the eyes . The burden of his talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some political object in writing about Mr. Williams , and to urge the expediency of an alliance with Henry V. I told him I had no political object , although it was by no means improbable that political results might grow out of it ; but that , if I ever had such intentions , he might be very certain that I would not commit* myself , nor would Mr. Williams to any persons without knowing the object of the application , and seeing credentials . He then began to talk at random about affairs on the continent , as if to distract my attention , plying me with questions ; but I kept my eyes on him till I got him out of the door . As he was going away , he said that since I would not confess that I had a political object , or wished to work against the Emperor , he could not make the propositions he had designed , and that the responsibility of the failure must rest upon Mr. Williams and myself . At length , however , after his last claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , being palleci with the Bourbon question , had turned to some fresher excitement , Mr. Williams retired , wearied out , to his lonely home at llogansburgh . And , although he had yet other plans in view , it became evident that his long and chequcred career was drawing to a close . For some weeks he lingered , at first in severe need , at length made comfortable by timely assistance ; and so , nursed by Indians , he died quietly on the 28th of August , 1858 . He was buried near his house , and no stone marks his grave . Was he Bourbon , or halfbreed I If the first , as so many thought , were ever so many vicissitudes condensed into one mortal life ? If the last , what a triumph over disadvantages , what a fertility of invention marked this member of what is generally considered an ignoble race !
