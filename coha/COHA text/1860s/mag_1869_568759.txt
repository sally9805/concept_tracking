ARTICLE 111. - YALE COLLEGE AND THE LATE MEET ING OF THE ALUMNI IN NEW YORK . Yale College in 1868 . Some Statements resJ9ect*ng the late progress and present condition of the various Departments of the University , for the i*formation of its Graduates , Friends , and Benejactors . Prepared by the Executive Committee of the Society of the Alumni . New Haven : 1868 . Reports of the iJileeting qi ' the Yale Alumni Association of New York , held on the 29th of January , 1869 . New York Times , and Tribune , of Jan. 30 , 1869 . THE graduates of Yale College , who reside in several of our larger cities , and in their immediate neighborhood , have recently formed a number of " Alumni Associations " for the purpose of keeping alive and perpetuating their interest in one another and in the College . ln Boston and Philadelphia at the east ; and in Cincinnati and Chicago at the west , these associations have held annual meetings for two or three years past , and with most satisfactory results in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 29th of January of the present year , the Alumni*in New York assembled , for the first time , at a public dinner , and , under very favorable circumstances , inaugurated their association , which is to be , of course , by far the largest in the country . The nearness of New haven to the city of New York , and the abundant openings , which are found in that city , for young men entering every department of professional or business life , have led large numbers of Yale graduates , for many years past , to establish themselves there . Every class , indeed , as it leaves the College , sends many of its members to represent it in the metrol ) olis , and the tendency thitherward increases continually and rapidly . It is said that , already , about five hundred may be enrolled as members of the * ew York Association . The assembling together // of so large a body of liberally educated men , who , however widely separated they may be in their present employments , are yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the past , is an event of no little interest in itself . Bnt when we think of the relations which they sustain to the University where they received their education , and of the good which they may be led to do in its behalf as their affection for it is quickened and strengthened , their meeting gathers around itself an interest of another sort . These gentlemen are in one of the great centres of commercial life . Many of them are men of prominence and repntation , who may not only bear witness , by the very position which they hold , of the excellence of the College from which they came , but also may , thiough their influence upon others , help the College , both directly and indirectly , in many ways . Many of them , also , have already acquired or are now rapidly acquiring wealth , and the spirit of generosity awakened in them may lead to most happy results in coming time . We are glad , then , both for their own sake and for the sake of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been devised , in these recent years , to bring together the graduates , and to make them feel that they belong to Yale College . The late meeting in New York was attended by about two hundred and fifty persons , including , in addition to a large coin pany of graduates residin* in the city , a few of the prominent benefactors of the College and the President , together with eleven of the frof*ssors , who , in response to a cordial invitation , had gone from New Haven in order to be present . The President was received with marks of esteem and affection , which were unmistakable and universal , and which to those who are daily witnesses of the faithful and disinterested spirit in which his great abilities and acquirements are devoted to the service of the College , must have been in the highest degree gratit*ing . The greatest good feeling and enthusiasm prevailed , and the words of the various speakers , so far as allusion was made to the College , were words of warm interest in their Alma Mater . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held elsewhere in one important i.espect-nalnely , in that reporters for the Press were present , // who , on the following morning , gave to the public much of what had been said . These reported remarks of different persons have since led to considerable discussion , both among the graduates and in other quarters ; and , as they referred to subjects of importance to the future well-being of the College , it is a matter of much moment that the questions should be properly understood . Discussion , in itself is not an evil . It is only when it proceeds on mistaken grounds , or involves serious uw founded complaints , or betrays a want of appreciation of the necessities of the case , that it becomes an injury to the cause which it is professedly designed to aid . That the great body of the graduates of Yale have anything at he art , in their feeling toward the College , but the warmest affection and the most earnest desires for its good , we do not believe . The exceptions are very rarely , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe , that the greater portion of them meet every subject connected with the institution with as much freedom from prejudice and as much candor , as they have in their consideration of any subject whatever . But we believe there are ertoneous views in the minds of a certain number of persons , both within and without the circle of the Alumni , which , in some cases , are diligently spread abroad , and , in general , are in danger of being hastily accepted ; and we believe that it is for the highest interests of the institution , that , when these subjects are forced upon us as they now are , they should be carefully cleared of all such erroneous views . Sometimes such views arise from that want of accurate acquaintance with the facts , which is always and necessarily found , in greater or less degree , among those who are not daily familiar with them . Sometimes they are owing to mistaken notions on the general subject of education , or are the result of a too ready yielding to what is called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be their origin , they are still errors and are injurious , and , as such , should be carefully avoided . We propose , in the present Article , to refer to those topics which were suggested at the meeting at New York , in connection with one or two others , and to ask the attention of our readers to some things which we deem of importance in the consideration of them . // I. PROPOSED CHANGE IN THE CORPORATION . The first of these points has reference to a change in the Corporation of the College , suggested by President Woolsev . This change involves the removal from that body of the six members cf the Senate of the State of Connecticut , who now have a place in it by virtue of the office which they hold , and the appointment of an equal number of graduates of the college , who shall retain their position for at least six or eight years . It is said , that long experience shows that the State Senators do not attend the meetings of the board with any regal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a single year , owing to the firmly-established principle of rotation in office , and to other reasons which it is not important to mention , they are not able to become acquainted either with their own duties , as members of the Corporation , or with the condition or wants of the College . These gentlemen* thus , are of little benefit to the institution . They can not serve its inter in , ey would . They become , ests , any considerable dearee if th of necessity , scarcely more than nominal members , and the burdens and responsibilities devolving upon the board are left to their associates , who are permanently in it . If , on the other hand , their places were supplied by as many persons , selected from among the graduates , who should be chosen for a term of years , and should be re*1igible after that term had expired , there would be a reasonable hope of advantage both from their deep interest in the College where their education had been received , and from their trained judgment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be punctual and regular in their attendance . They would have views " at once enlightened and conservative . " They would be earnest in devising and in carrying out all good measures , and would be in every way " a new strength to their Alma Mater . " The plan , with its advantages , as thus set forth , was first presented to public notice in an Article in the New Englander , in Oct. , 1 866 , and seems to have been suggested to the mind of its distinguished author by a somewhat similar change then lately introduced at Harvard 11 niversity . Its renewed presentation , at the late meeting of which we now speak , shows that the refiec // tion which he has given to it since that time has not altered his view of its advisableness and practicability . Any suggestion on a subject connected with the interests of the Colieo'e which comes from such a source , will , of course , be received with most respectful consideration . Its author has been fain iliar , for more than twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College , and , for a much longer period , he has known its interior life , and studied its wants . And , at the same time , he is known by all ac ( Iuainted with the institution to be one who rarely , and only in the exercise of his most matured judgment , brings forward *proposals of this character affecting its vital interests . It will be interesting , therefore , to notice the reason , and , so far as he has ever given any intimation , the only reason , which has induced President Woolsey to think of this change ; - and , in connection with this point , some general considerations which have a bearing upon the subject may be appropriately presented . The sole reason , then , which has led to his suggestion of the change now proposed , is the one we have mentioned-namely , the fact that graduates of the College , as members of its Board of Trustees , might be expected to be more interested in its welfare , and more qualified to do it good in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if political life , become , for a single year , members of the State Senate . We do not spc* k in his behalf , or with any knowledge ot his views , beyond what is conveyed in his published remarks on the subject , but we think all judicious persons , whose attention is turned to this matter , will be impressed by this fact , and will find in it a conclusive answer to much that has been inconsiderately said by certain advocates of the new arrangement . We propose to notice , briefly , a few points which some persons , who are dissatisfied with the present state of affairs , are disposed to urge . In the first place , it is said that the College is uritorturiately in. the hand8 *t a few Connecticut mini.ste'r8 Sometimes the word " Puritanical** is added , in order to give a rhetorical emphasis to the expression . Since the year 1792 , this has not been the fact , so far as the constitution of the Board is concerned . There have been eight lay members and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the // six Senators  --  the Governor and Lieutenant Governor of the State have been active , efficient , and valuable persons to the College . If the lay members attend the meetings , they have the same voice as their clerical associates , and if they do not attend , the clerical members , as reasonable men , are influenced , in proper measure , by the views and judgment of that body of persons who are most intimately connected with the College as its Faculty of Instruction . That they are Connecticut ministers is no more objectionable-and , for an obvious reason , far less so-than if they were Pennsylvania ministers . That they are Puritanical ministers is a mere charge appealing to the baser nassions of men , and is unworthy of notice . That they are ministers is a fact . And why should they not be ? The Colleges of our country-certainly those of New England-were originally designed to be both literary and religious institutions-places where true learning could be gained , and where all who entered them might be pointed to Christianity and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glory of New England in the past , and , when they cease to have both these characters , they had better be sunk in the ocean than remain to curse the country . But what class of men is there in the community who have been in all the past , and , so far as we can judge , will be in all the future , more safe guardians of these two interests together than Christian ruinisters ? By the very necessities of their profession , they are compelled to be better educated men than the majority of those around them . They learn more thoroughly than most other persons to appreciate the value of scholarship and sound learning , and , in almost avery place , they are , by the spontaneous choice of their fellow-citizens , placed among the number of those who care for the educational interests of the people . Who can doubt , that-on the grounds which are connected with learning only-they ought to have a share in the direction of all such public institutions ? And when we add to these interests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a College is safer for all time if at least one-half its governing Board are members of this honored profession ? But just this is the constitution of that Board which controls the affairs of Yale College . The reformers of the day who would exclude these // ministers altogether , as some of them openly intimate that they would , are no wise well-wishers to the cause of learning consecrated by religion ; and , we may add , they hardly understand the true interests of the former better than those of the latter . But it is said , that ministers are likely to be slow or behind the age . Some of them are so , no doubt , but so are some lawyers and a good many other laymen ;  --  and that ministers , as a class , arc behind the age , and are not as ready for every wise progressive step , in morals or education , as any class of men , is a charge which all the recent history of New England disproves , and which the discussions of the great questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to silence . It is said , however , that learning and religion are not all that a College needs ; - it needs money also , and ministers know nothing about money . Wealthy and large-minded laymen are necessary for financial management . Our only answer to this question is , that the history of Yale College proves the opposite . The statement of President Woolsey , made at Boston and repeated in New York , speaks volumes on this point . He says the Corporation of Yale College have never lost a cent during all the history of the College ,  --  that they can find every dollar in the treasury which has ever been entrusted to their keeping . How many bodies of wealthy and intelligent laymen can say the same of the moneys belonging to institutions of which they have had charge for a long period of years ? " By their fruits ye shall know them . " When the facts are known , the Connecticut ministers begin to appear in a pretty favorable light . But nothing is easier than to speak depreciatingly of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the facts . But , again , it is said , that though they may have taken reasonable care of the funds which they happened to receive , they have done nothing to increase them . We call , for the facts here again . It is well known to every one who has investigated this matter at all , that the age of large gifts to literary institutions-except , indeed , in rare cases-is one of comparatively recent beginning . Thirty or fifty years ago , large fortunes were not comm on , and the collecting of such sums as a Colleoe needs was a work of immense difficulty . And yet , more than // thirty years ago , one hundred thousand dollars were raised by a wide extended effort tinder the direction of the College Corporation ,  --  ( and their agent , we may add , was a minister , ) - and as new departments of the College were established , from time to time , when they were needed , funds were gathered in for their support . And what has been the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars have been raised-so large a sum , indeed , that Yale College has become to many minds an institution rolling in wealth , with no farther needs . Certainly this history-recent and more remote-does not present the appearance of inactivity or incapacity on the part of those who govern the College . The clerical gentlemen , so much complained ot ; have , at least , had the wisdom to appoint College officers who have raised large part of this money ; and they have known how to take care of it and use it well , when it has been raised . Just at the close of a period of ten years , during which the College has received a million of dollars , largely gathered in by its own officers , is a time when it is not very becoming in any one to find fault with the governing board as a body of Connecticut ministers , who are unfit to get or to use any large amount of money . Well might President Woolsey say , as he di ( l at New York , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board , that he offered his proposition for a special change in its constitution . And well might such a man as Governor Buckingham , whose knowledge of money and its noblest uses is surpassed by that of no man living , bear testimony to the efficiency of the body with which he had been so long ' connected ;  --  a testimony which , we may add , in his case , was given not only in words , but in the more emphatic way of intrusting , before he left it , twenty-five thousand dollars to its keeping . Fr inn what has bQen said in some quarters* of late , it would seem to be supposed that these ministers in the Corporation of Yale College are persons who have no connection at all with the Alumni , and no common sympathies with them . The graduates have been shut out ,  --  so it appears to be claimed ,  - -  ever since the beginning , from any influence in the institution , a ! *d now , at last , they ought to find a place in its government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite of this representation . The fact is this ,  --  that , as soon as the College had been in existence long enough to have any graduates of age or standing , th choice of members of the Board of Trustees beo'an to be mainly limited to those who were graduates of the College , and , during the last hundred and thirty years , there have been only twelve persons in the clerical part of the Corpration , who had not received their education at Yale . The clerical gentlemen are members of the body of Alumni , all of them , and have never been anything else . The Faculty of Instruction have been , from the beginning , almost exclusively graduates of the College . The control of the College , in every department of its interests , has thus been entirely in the hands of those who represent the graduates in so far as they belong to their number and are wholly of them . And we are not aware that any evidence has ever been furnished , in the history of any institution in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the whole , wiser or more disinterestedly devoted to its welfare , than those who have chosen the profession of the ministry . The true question to be considered should not be lost sight of , and the mistaken ideas which are being spread abroad should be cleared away . The question is not , whether the graduates should now , for the first time , find a place in the governing Board of the College , but whether , havir ! g substantially already in their possession the clerical portion of the Board  --  to say nothing of the Faculty of Instruction-they should also take that place which has , for sixty or seventy years past , been held by the State Senators . Is it best for the College that this change should be made ? Will the College be better governed and cared for , if , in additin to the clerical members who are already of the Alumni , it has the six other members of the Board chosen from among the graduates in different sections of the land , than if as at present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the College is located ? In the second place , it is urged by many persons who favor changes of the kind under discussion , that Yale College needs to bicome a national institution , and that to this end its guyeriing Board should be composed of ' representatives , not from // Connecticut only , but from all parts of the Union . We agree with all persons who think that Yale College should be , in the future , if possible , the first and best University in the country ; and that , as its doors should be open to students from every section , so students from the most distant parts of the land should gladly come to it . But in order to its having a national character , it does not need to be governed by representatives from Missouri or California . For the highest interests of aL public institutions of learning , unconnected with the general government , it is undoubtedly desirable that they should be managed by small bodies of well qualified men , whose residence is in the vicinity of the institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his judgment and abilities may be-as successfully perform the duties of overseeing a Coilege in Maine , as one who is within a day 's journey of the place where it is located . He needs to be near at hand , not only that he may come readily at its call , but that he may be surrounded constantly by the influences and sympathies of its neighborhood . Our fathers founded this College for the Colony of Connecticut , and very wisely they did not put its management into the hands of Massachusetts or South Carolina , but of Connecticut men . They knew that it would be fostered and cherished most by those nearest to it , and that those who were called to watch over its welfare should be where they could see it . It has grown , indeed , far beyond their highest thought of its future , and has extended its influence far and wide over the country and the world . But its home is in Connecticut still , and , until it ceases to have its home here , its official gnardians should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The thing that is needed is , that , amid all the growth and demands of the future , it should be ,  --  what , in considerable measure at least , it has been in the past ,  --  a College so excellent in its discipline and teaching , that the whole people shall know it as a bright light in the world . in this sense , it may be , and ought to be , a national university ; - that is , a university with a national reputation , and drawing its pupils from the north and the south , the east and the west alike . And in this sense only , is it a matter of high importance that it should be national in its character . It was founded // in Connecticut , and for Connecticut ; - it has been , for more than a hundred and fifty years , one of the brightest ornaments which Connecticut has had to glory in , and we hope the day may never come when the control of its interests shall pass into other hands . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not so much the giving over the entire control of the College into other hands ,  --  for the fathers , in their wisdom , provided that the clerical portion of the board should be Connecticut men , and made this a part of the permanent charter of the institution ; - it is that , in order to give a national character to the College , it is in no wise necessary to change any part of the existing Board . It has had such a character , in a great measure , for many years , as is universally acknowledged , and it bids fair to have it always , if it goes onward as it has done . Its governors should be near it . They should not be swayed by the influences and sympathies of remote places , or , perchance , of other institutions , and thus be out of harmony with the historic growth of the College in the old place . We can scarcely question , that the Legislature of this State will hesitate somewhat to give up the State interest in the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem desirable . We are very glad that it can not give up  --  and that no one else but the successors of the first ten ministers who founded the College can give up-that interest which this State must always retain in its government through the clerical body in its Corporation . A third point , which is urged , is , that the College belong8 to the Alumni , and that they , therefore , have the right to manage it . No more , certainly , than the parents of a family belong to the children , and ought to yield the right of govern nient or of a share in the government of the family to the children who have left their home . The College is under obligations to its Alumni , to love them , to welcome them heartily as they return to their old home , and to care for and rejoice in their fair fame and success . It stands to them in the parental relation . It is their Alma Mater . They , on the other hand , belong , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undying obligations to it . It has given them their education , and has done for them a very large part of that which prepares them for and secures br them // the various blessings and honors of after life . It has bestowed npn every one of them-largely as a charitable gift-everything which they have learned within its walls . It has opened the way , through what it has given them , to all learning . And no one of them , who knows the glory of being an educated rather than an uneducated man , can fail to feel in his inmost soul , that , in so far as it has made him an educated man , or given him the possibility of becoming one , it has bestowed upon him a priceless gift . No graduate of Yale College ( or of any other that is worthy of the name ) who has faithfully used the advantages it offered him , can ever repay the debt he owes to it , any more than he can repay the debt he owes his mother 's love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to do anything he can for it . He may even desire a place in its Board of Trustees , that he may be the better ahle to repay its kindness in good services and helpfulness . But when he claims a right to manage its affairs and direct its government , as some of those who are pressing this matter are now doing in public l ) laces , because he is an alnmnus , he is claiming that the College shall yield itself to his control , not because he has conferred a benefit . upon it , but because it has conferred an inestimable benefit upon him . It should be remarked , also , that while Yale College is a public institution , it is so only in the sense that it is open to the public and was designed by its founders to do good to the world . It belongs to no body , so far as the right of controlling it is concerned , except to those who founded it and to their successors . It is like every other College in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect . It is a corporation designed by its originators to be , and having always been , self-perpetuating . It was founded for special purposes , and its founders , like most other wise men who have had a similar w*rk to do , felt that it was more sure to accomplish these ends for all time , if they gave to its Trustees the power of selecting their own suc2essors , than if they left it to the chances and dangers of the uncertain future . Their wisdom has been justified by its wonderful growth and prosperity for more than a century and a half . When it ceases to do good , let the public withdraw their approbation by withdrawing its students . // I3ot whileit keeps onward in its present course-its numbers and opportunities , and means of usefulness , and rcputation. and permanent funds increosin* with a steady and uninterrupted progress-we have no fears either that it will ever lose its honorable position , or that judicious and Christian men will feel that the fathers made a mistake in creating its Board of Trustees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a public institution , inasmuch as it is for the good of the world . It is a beneficent public institution , inasmuch as it hives the best education which the country affords to every student . who comes to it , at less than one-half of its actual cost . But in its management and government , it is not , and was never designed to be , a public institution . It is what every other institution for benevolence , or for the enlightenment of the world-which is not established by the State -- invariably is ,  --  - namely , a self-perpetuating corporation . And so long as it has the great interests of religion and education to care for and watch over , it should remain what it now is . The great body of the Alumni , as we believe , agree with us in this view ; and we present it thus emphatically , not because we doubt their opinions , but because there is evidently , in the minds of a few , both among the Alumni and outside of their number , an idea that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they ought to have , no more claim to control it than any other body of men . The only question in this matter  --  and it can not be too often repeated or too constantly borne in mind-is not one of rights on the part of any one among the public or even among the Alumni , but solely one which concerns the highest well-being of the University . If this can best be secured by the appointment ( in addition to the present clerical members , who , as we have already seen , have , from the early times , been almost without exception of the number of its graduates ) of the six remaining members of its Board of Trustees from among its Alumni , then it becomes an act of wisdom on its part to appoint them ; - and this , and this alone , is the question which ought now to be discussed . President Woolsey has expressed his opinion in answer to this question , and we have found it to be favorable to this new reception of graduates into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above alluded to , in which his view seems to be more fully expressed than in his remarks in New York , he has suggested one or two dangers , which have appeared to us so serious as to deserve most careful consideration before the plan in its details should be finally determined upon . lie says , " Will not these graduates , if well elected , be a new strength to their Alma Mater ? " and in speaking of the similar changes at Harvard , he says , " What is there to prevent party tickets among the graduates , with the necessary excitements before and ill-t*eling after the election ? " If the graduate members are not " well elected , " they had better not be elected at all . There have been , as far as we are aware , only two methods of choosing these members suggested publicly up to the present time , and both of them seem to us open to serious objections . One of these methods is to have the elections held at the meetings of the graduates at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual meetings are necessarily hurried meetings . They are attended by not more than a sixth part of the living Alumni . They are seasons when a thousand other things are filling the minds of those presetit , unless , indeed , they come for this purpose only . They could , theretore , be very easily " packed "  --  to use the language of politics-in favor of particular candidates , or even by the candidates themselves . They would be liable to have their harmony and good feeling-so large a part of the usefulness and enjoyment of such meetings-broken up by the pressing of " partytickets , " and by the " excitetnents and ill-feeling , " of which Dr. Woolsey speaks . Moreover , there is no opportunity at such meetings for that calmness and seriousness of consideration , which is essential in order to the selecting of suitable men for the office . It is the restless and dissatisfied men who are most active on all such occasions . Those who are content to " let well enough alone , " and see no special change of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will generally be in active . And the field is thus free for the operations ot the former class . Who can doubt that they will , most likely , be successful wherever the conservative section is not roused , as it will not often be , to an earnest opposition ? President Woolsey // paid no mean compliment to the State Senators , and said no light word in favor of the present system , when he said that those gentlemen " had done no harm . " If the method above suggested for choosing the graduate members were to be adopted , we question very much whether , atter twenty years ' experience , it could be said , with equal truth , that they had - " done no harm . " And this , not because the graduates are not the best class of men , but because they are like all other men , and therefore time innovators and hasty reformers and more selfish among them would , under such a system of election , be very often successful in pushing their way into the management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be the fact . Perhaps it might not be oftener than in one case out of every three or four . But the election of one noisy agitator , or of a single individual who was disposed to think , in accordance with the declared views of one of the prominent Trustees of a prominent College in New York , that the reading of the American Encyclopedia would be as good a way of educating the mind as the usual course of College studies , might be an incalculable injury to any institution devoted to the cultivation of sound learning . We have had some opportunities for personal observation in this matter , and we have had testimony founded on l&amp;ng acquaintance with the government of at least one other prominent College ; and we believe that the greatest of all dangers to which such institutions are exposed is from the election into their Boards of Trustees of men who will " do ham 'm . " And in the adoption of any new system of election , the wisest thought and the greatest core ought to be brought into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . The same objections apply , to an equal , if not even greater degree , to the other of the two plans referred to abovenamely , the election of one member of the Corporation by each of the Associations of the Alumni in the various larger cities of the country . These bodies , being much smaller than the one which assembles at the College at Commencement , wou ldbe even more likely to be hurried or engineered into the adoption of ill-judged measures , or the election of unsuitable men . But there are further weighty objections against this scheme . // These bodies , located in different cities , have , of necessity , their local prejudices , and may not unfrequently have views which are determined by the sympathies of the region in which they live . Moreover they , all together , include only a section , and even a small section , of the whole Alumni . The power of election is thus thrown into the hands of a few , while those who are in the more remote and retired places are denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are often the ones whose judgment is of most value , and whose minds are least likely to be carried away by ill-consideren views . We see no reason why Boston arid Philadelphia graduates , for cxample , should take this matter into their own hands , whije the alumnus , whose work in life calls him to live in Northern Vermont , or the interior of set entirely aside , simply because of his residence . It might , possibly , be desirable , at some time , that a particular graduate from i3ostomm or from Philadelphia should be in the Corporation ot the College , 1 ) ut , even if it should be so , he should not , for very obvious reasons , be elected by his associates only whose home is in the same city . This plan , however , so far as we are aware , has never been suggested by any one except a single speaker , iii a few extemporaneous remarks at a late public dinner , and doubtless it was , in his own mind , only the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so utterly impiacticable , that we can hardly believe it would ever be seriously entertained . Such a change should not be made in a day . It should be carefully considered . And the consideration and decision of it should turn-as we think all judiciQus persons will admit-solely upon what is for the highest good ( f the ( *ollege . We believe that neither of the plans suggested will best conduce to this end . A much better plan , as it seems to us , would be this . Let the present Corporation , who would be able to do it with much deli I eration-with entire freedom fro in prejudices-with a due regard to the interests of all sections-with a thorough knowledge of the needs of the College , and with the warm affection for it which has , undeniably , characterized all the permanent members in the past , select six new members from among the graduates , who shall hold their office either for life , or for such a considerable period of years as shall give them // opportunity for good service ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death or otherwise , let the Board , as then existing , elect successors to fill the vacancies . By this means , the best men can be found  --  the men who know most about educational interests , who have most sympathy with sound learning , and whose opinions and efforts will be most beneficial to the College . The conservative and progressive elements can thus be best united , and the serious dangers of every kind can be most successfully avoided . And we see no reason why , at least in rare cases , the choice might not go beyond the circle of the Alumni , and rest upon such men as Governor Buckingham , whose education has been outside of college walls , indeed , but whose interest in the cause of learning is as honorable as their judgment is wise . The men who elect the Trustees should , in general , be the men who are best qualified to do so . No one will question this . NYc believe that these men are the ones who are most familiar with the College history and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent a body of persons , no doubt , as the country contains . They are possessed *f wisdom and knowledge and high character , as much as any men . Their opinions , on many subjects , are worthy of high regard . But comparatively few of them , after leaving the College at their graduation , are able to know anything of its interior life . They are widely removed from it in space . They are busily engaged in pursuits which draw their thoughts away from it , and which give them little opportunity for reflection on the great subjects of education . At the end of five , or ten , or twenty years , therefore , they have , by the very necessities of life , lost their powers 9f passing an intelligent judgment on questions which arise in regard to the progress or interests of the institution with which they were once familiar as students . They have become unqualified , fur the same reason , to decide intelligently who are the best persons to be chosen for the management of its affairs . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are thus disqualified . The same is true in regard to every department of life . If I have been connected with a college for twenty years as an instructor or a trustee , if I have daily watched its growth and known everything belogning to it , if I have had a large share in raising all its fund // which have been gathered in during all that period , if I have canvassed the field , over and over again , and have become acquainted , in this way , with all the probabilities and possibilities of enlarging its means of good , if I have made its work my life 's work , and have filled my mind with those thin*rs which lie within its field of study and of usefulness , I am , for this very reason , better qualified ,  --  and vastly better qualified ,  --  to judge what is for its good , or what person will be most useful as one of its governing Board , than my classmate who has passed those same twenty years in a New York bank or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place my views on questions belonging to his line of life on an equality with his , as it is to place his , in my line of life , on an equality with mine , lie may be a much abler man than I am in many respects , but he is inferior to me in this respect , because he has , of necessity , been thinking mainly of other things . No one can reflect upon this subject , with any seriousness , without admitting the truth of what we say . It would be a disgrace to either party , if it were not so . It is no depreciation , therefore , of the merits of the graduates of*ny one of our Colleges to say thatgreat numbers of them have not the essential qualifications to give judgment on its management , or the necessary knowledge of the subject , in all its relations , to make them wise voters for its offices of trust . In the case of the government of the country this is not so , for every intelligent man , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to think constantly and intelligently on political subjects , but , in the case of colleges and all private institutions for the public good , what we have said is certainly true . A very large section of those who leave our colleges never give any study , and , from the pressure of their work in life , are never able to give any serious study , to the subject of College education ;  --  and they surely ought not to vote on the subject . If they do vote , what shall prevent their voting wrong ,  --  or what shall prevent their voting for the wrong man , being led by his prominence and reputation to believe him to be qualified for what he has really no fitness for at all ? But if the election is put into the hands of the men who thoroughly know what they are doing-that is , into the hands of the Board , which has justified its claim to wisdom // 18 ( 39 . Yale College . 287 and disinterestedness by a long course of service , then all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be with any arrangement which can be devised . The change in the Corporation which is now under discussion has not , as is erroneously believed by many , been called for , for some years past , by any general movement of the graduates , nor , so far as any evidence has yet been given , by any large body among the graduates . A few persons , no doubt , here and there had spoken of some such thing , and wished that some change might take place in the constitution of the Board . But when the first suggestion of it was made by President Woolsey , it was a new thought to almost every one . Since its suggestion very few of the Alumni have earnestly advocated it , and we have reason to believe that numbers among them do not feel that it is very desirable . But , however this may be , one thing is clearly manifest-that there has been neither any universal , nor any general , nor any specially noticeable complaint among the Alumni as to the general management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling is that which President Woolsey has so decidedly and pnblicly expressed-namely , that of confidence in it . A small number of graduates and of other persons-most of whom have no intimate knowledge whatever of the affairs of the Collegehave spoken depreciatingly of the Corporation . Complaints in regard to certain things in its action or want of action , from time to time , have been heard from different quarters , and some ot them may have been just ones . But as for any general dissatisfaction with the present government , or any feeling that a change ought to be made on this account , there is not only no evidence existing of any such thing , but there is every reason to believe that it is far otherwise . The graduates of Yale College are not , and never have been , dissatisfied with its management , or without confidence in its Corporation ;  --  and the statement that they are so is one of those loose statements which we so often hear in these days , and which rest mainly , if not wholly , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No man , or body of men , is perfect . Mistakes will inevitably occur in the course of years ; - and , when they occur , they will be seen , and will , sometimes at least , be spoken of . // But we do not believe any Corporation ever existed in the country against whom less complaint was made , than has been made against the Corporation of Yale College by its great body of j udicious graduates . The idea , then , which has been thrown out in some quarters , that the graduates of Yale have not contributed more largely to its ' funds because they were unwilling to intrust their money to the keeping of Trustees who were so unqualified to take care of it , is an idea , as we believe , totally withoutfoundatiom . It is a very remarkable fact , if it be a fact ; - for during the last few years , within which these assertions of wide spread dissatisfaction have especially been made , nearly a million of dollars has been given into the hands of this Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no care as to what becomes of it ,  --  a sum not only larger by far than had ever been given before , but larger than has been contributed , during the same period , to any other College in the country ,  --  not excepting harvard itself ; whose vicinity to the rich men of Boston has always given it special advantages in this regard , and whose pre*niinence in the amount of its donations has , until this recent period , been unquestioned . The gentlemen who are troubled in view of the incapacity of the present Corporation to manage the College funds are not among the generous and wealthy men of the country . Nor do they , as we believe , include the great body of such men among the graduates , for , within this same period , more has been given by graduates to the College than ever before . A single one among them has presented to the College the sum of nearly three hundred thousand dollars . And another , who resides in New Haven , and who has had opportunities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a most frequent and liberal donor-so much so that , probably , no man in the country has ever proved himself to be a more wise , more constant , or more t*aiththl friend to the cause of education in Literature or Art than has he in what he has done for Yale College . Surely , if evidence cami be obtained anywhere , that the possessors of wealth have the same confidence , which Dr. Woolsey has , in this Board of Trustees , here is such evidence of a most unmistakable character-in a most abundant degree . Why , then , have not the graduates generally // made larger contributions ? There are several reasons why they have not . One is , that most of them have always been men of moderate means , and , until quite recently , almost none of them have been possessors of ample fortunes . Another is , that , in this imperfect world , very few persons give very largely to any object entirely of their own impulse , or except as they are impelled to it by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , like those of harvard , live in its imrnediate neighborhood , but are scattered all over the country , where they have never been reached by persons soliciting in behalf of the College . Still another reason is , that , in this day , men who have only a small sum to give  --  a few hundred dollars , perhaps-feel that it is lost , and that it becomes almost useless among the gifts of tens of thousands from wealthy men around them . The feeling has come to be this , that a large gift must be given to a great institution , or none at all ; and men who can not give large sums feel themselves , therefore , almost shut np to the other alternative . We have met hundreds of the graduates of Yale from every section of the country , during the past twenty years , and have conversed with them freely on the subject of the College . We have heard from them numberless expressions of warm affection and giatitude for what the College had bestowed upon them while members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gladly aid it by peenniary gifts , if they could . But we have never seen a single one who expressed the slightest unwillinguebs to intrust anything which he had to give to its Board of Trustees . And even one of the most active and energetic advocates of the present proposed change , with whom we were personally connected for a considerable period , was not only willing to subscribe according to his ability for the assistance of the College , but to press its claims far and wide upon others . We believe that nothing is more true than that the great body of the Alumuni are satisfied , in the main , with the financial managemerit of the College , so far as they are qualified , by knowledge of the facts , to judge of the matter ; and that the reason of the small number of gifts which have been received from them , is to be sought elsewhere than in any feeling of discontent . We do not doubt that the number of gifts , and of large gifts , from // the graduates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . We believe it , because the graduates , as well as othet men , are growing richer constantly , because the habit of giving is extending itself and becoming more settled everywhere in the country , and because there will doubtless be more systematic arrangements hereafter to solicit such gifts . But we do not believe the proposed change in the Corporation - whatever other advantages may result from it-will renmve any unwillingness , or increase materially the willingness , of the graduates to give to the College . Money for benevolent causes is gathered in only by hard work . It is very easy , in the enthusiasm of a public meeting or the good fellowship of a public dinner , to say , Undertake this or that gigantic enterprise and present the bill to the Alutani . But the man who should begin to carry out the enterprise on the ground of this encouragement , would show that he had had little experience in the matter of raising money by contributions . The gifis to Yale College , during the past ten , not to say the vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large measure , because the officers of the College have earnestly and patiently solicited them . The same thing will be true in all time to come , and it will mainly be in answ*r to their personal and patient solicitations that money will ever be obtained . And the mere fact , that the Alumni are represented in the Corporation by a few honorable gentlemen , will not change the great law of the world . Men will not be inspired by this fact to give largely . They will , in general , give largely , if at all , just as they have done , because the College Faculty  --  the men who have given themselves to the College , and who live in it every day-go out among them , with all the influence and earnestness which they possess , and tell , as no one else can tell , the story of its wants . We have spoken , thus , at some length upon this subject , because we feel that certain erroneous , and , on the part of some persons , diligently disseminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The reason for the proposed change is not to be found in any one of these things to which reference has been made ; and as the discussion of the subject is entered upon seriously , it ought to be confined to the real // point in question . Jf the College will , on the whole , be benefited by the presence in its Corporation of six of its graduates , in place of the present equal number of State Senators , then , dou* ) tle*s , the change may well be made , but not otherwise . This is the reason given by President Woolsey for favoring the change , aud is t*4e only reason which he has given or which is worthy of consideration . like bighest interests of the College as i%tluenced by the character of the men composing its Board of Trustees-this is the whole question to be discussed . We do not think this question ought to be decided , except after deliberate consideration . But , if it is decided , and decided favorably for the proposed change , then there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manner in which these persons shall be chosen . We believe the plans snggested are fraught with possibilities of danger and evil , as we have already shown ; and we have no doubt that the plan of election by the members of the Board itself from among the Alumni , is a plan which will be most free from all evil , and which will best secure th' great ends of deliberation and wisdom in the choice , as well as the possession of a thorough knowledge of all the essential qualifications for the office on the part of those who make the choice . II . THE REMOVAL OF THE COLLEGE . The second prominent subject referred to at the New York meeting was also brought forward by President Woolsey . It was the subject of a removal of the College from its present site , and building anew at a distance of a mile and a quarter from the center of the city , where it now is . The President , in speaking upon this point ; * announced a decision which had been reached after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most careful estimate of the cost of the undertaking ,  --  nam ely , a decision that the Cilege must remain where it is . As this subject , also , has been discussed in the public papers and elsewhere quite extensively of late , and as few persons , who have not patiently looked into it on all sides , appreciate it in its various bearings , it is deemed not inappropriate to say a few words in regard to it here ,  --  presenting the // matter in what we believe to be its proper light , and showing that some of the arguments urged in favor of a removal are of little weight , while others are overbalanced by the difficulties which lie in the way of accomplishiig it . The removal of Yale College from its present site has been advocated chiefly on account of the present size and prospective growth of the city of New Haven . It has been thought by many that , if a new site could be procured on the east side of Prospect street , on the elevated land which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advantages would result from the change . Any other site among those which have been named and which could be procured , would be , in our judgment , undesirable ; and the question of removing to any other would not deserve to be entertained . Among the reasons advanced in favor of removal , is the conside " ation of health . It is thought that the new situation would be in this respect decidedly preferable to the place where the Colleges now stand . To this argument we are not inclined to attach much weight . New Haven , whatever representatmns have been made to the contrary , is one of the most healthful towns in the country . Its soil , though flat , is porous , and it is washed half round its borders by the tides of the sea . During the month of August , which is here the least salubriotis month in the year , the students are dispersed for vacation . It is rare that anything that can be called an epidemic prevails here . A year ago there were a few cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proved fatal . But at that time , the aggregate amount of sickness in College , as physicians assure us , was not greater than is usually the fact at the same season of the year ; and the reports of the unhealthy condition of the city , which were , spread abroad in the newspal ) ers , were largely the product of fau*y . Students , as a rule , are far from being distinguished for their prudence as regards the care of their bodies ; and yet the average health of the members of College is remarkable . The present site , if provisions are made for drainage-which can be made easily . at a small cost-will afford no ground for apprehension or complaint on this score . It has been urged that the moral cxposures of students will constitute an increasing evil connected // with its present position . In reply , it nmy be said that these are not to be lessened by removing to a short distance from the city . The city will still be readily accessible . Cambridge is several miles from Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as great as if the College were in the city itself . As far as manners and deportment are concerned , a city is to be preferred to a country town as a place for a university . In the latter , the restraint from the local police and from the public opinion of citizens is comparatively small . Most of the great universities-as those of Paris , Edinburgh , . Berlin , Heidelberg-are in cities . Students are less disorderly and are more easily controlled in a large town than in a small one . It should also be observed that the growth of New Haven has thus far not been such as to deprive it of the character of a rural city . There is room still for indefinite expansion without crowding . It is true that the business part of the town will be compactly built and have the characteristics that belong to marts everywhere . The possibility that the Collye will be annoyed by the vicinity of noise and business , is the chief claim that can be urged in favor of a change of location . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose its force . At present the College is fully protected in front by the public Green , the quiet beanty of which is familiar to all who know anything of New Haven . An extension of the College limits in other directions , by judicious purchases , would go far to remove the difficulty which we have stated . The trade and manufacturing of the town have rather tended to move away from the College than towards it heretofore ; and this will , also , probably be the cAse hereafter . Were the dormitory system given up , no embarrassu*ent would be felt from the contracted extent of the old site . But it is wisely decided to retain this system , so far at least , as to provide accommodations for a majority of the students on the College grounds . We have mentioned the considerations which have an importance as beariug on the question whether a removal is expedient . It will be seen that there is no such pressing necessity of a change as has been represented . The Institution can be comftrtablc , can continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is consecrated in the memories and attachments of so large a number of graduates . Few universities in existence can boast of what is , on the whole , so beautiful and commodious a position . But , granting that a removal might be desirable , is it practicable ? The first answer would generally be in the affirm ative . New and costly buildings are to be erected ; man yof the old buildings must before long disappear , and the new Art Building , being designed , in part , for the benefit of the city , may be left where it is . The valuable land on which the Institution is now placed can be sold , and , with the proceeds , the new site can be purchased , and the new edifices erected . This would be the first impression of most persons to whom the question of the practicabieness of a removal should be submitted . A more thorough inquiry , however , would change this impression . On the most careful and sober estimate it has been ascertained , that the College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hundred thousand dollars over and above the proceeds of the sale of the present square , with the buildings upon it , together with the land adjacent that is owned by the College . And this large outlay would only give the same amount of accommodations , in the way of public and private rooms , which the College now has in its present place , leaving all enlargements in these respects*-That is , the erection of any additional number of buildings ,  --  to be provided for by a still farther outlay of money . To undertake the removal , without a half of a million of dollars to begin with , would be an imprudent and unwarrantable proceeding on the part of the Corporation . Can this large sum be raised for such a purpose ? In considering this question , it is important to bear in mind several facts . One of these is , that there are pressing and acknowledged wants of the institution , which it is very difficult to obtain the means of supplying . The Professors are not more than half paid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family respectably in New Haven . Then the library fund is miserably inadequate . The Professors are grievously embarrassed in prosecuting the researches that belong to their various departments of study , for want of the needed books . Then , again , for the best // efficiency of the Academical Department , its corps of instructors ought to be doubled . These are among the ibvious necessities of the College , of which the graduates are aware , but which , as we have said , it is very hard to supply . Another fact is , that direct efforts to solicit contributions for the Institution by any appeal to considerable numbers of persons or the general public , even when prosecuted with energy and judgment , have never been attended with more than moderate success ; - while , as to large gifts from individual perso s , they have most of them come only after there had been long reflection on the part of the donor , and*as the r*pe fruit of a benevolent purpose slowly and deliberately formed . But the absolute necessity of erecting those new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within a comparatively brief period , will not permit the determination of the question as to locating them to be indefinitely delayed . Still another point is , that , even it a half of a million of dollars could be collected merely to change the location of the Collet*e , it might , not improbably , fbllow that the giving power of its friends would be so far exhausted that it would suffer for a long time to come ,  --  suffer , we mean , in its higher , immaterial interests . But as to the feasibleness of obtaining this large sum for the purpose named , the opinion of those who have had most experience in the financial affairs of the College , who have been most successful in obtaining gifts for it , and who are best acquainted with its graduates , must be heeded . Their opinion is that it would be utterly impracticable . It is easy to be very sanguine in regard to such a subject ; but let those who are most sanguine say , first , how much they would give themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much they can promise on behalf of their acquaintance , with a reasonable probability that the promise would be verified . The results of consultation with friends of the College in the leading cities are most unfavorable to the hope that the requisite fund could be obtained . After dinner enthusiasm , when coined into money , as we have already said , often yields an unexpectedly small sum ; and the only way for practieal men , who are charged with responsibility , to determine a question of this sort is to make inquiries here and there , and to be guided by the results of such inquiries and by // the lights of experience . It being thus impracticable to change the site of the College , it behooves the institution to be content ( as well it may ) where it is . The friends of the College will do well to direct their attention to those wants of the institution which are more imperative and more serious than any that are likely to arise from the dimensions and situation of its grounds , and of which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE WANTS OF THE COLLEGE . We have alluded , in a former part of this Article , to the very large sum of money which has been given to the College within the past few years , and yet , in the remarks just made , we have stated that the wants of the institution are very pressing . How are these two statements to be reconciled ? This is a question which has riser ) , doubtless , in many minds , and it can scarcely be wondered at if the general conviction of late years is that the College abounds in wealth . A pamphlet has been recently placed in the hands of many of the Alumni , entitled " Yale College in 1868 , " and prepared by the Executive Committee of the General Society of the Alumni , which contains a careful statement of the condition of the College at present . At the end of this pamphlet is given a list of all the benefactions which have been received since 1860. and which severally amount to $5,000 or more . On looking over this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of it , that the General Fund of the Academical Department has only been increased to the extent of $5,000 , and , we may ald , that a very large proportion of the whole amount has been *iveu for the special purpose of erecting new buildings . These more special gifts have been , and will he , of great service to the College in the way of providing superior accommodations for its students , and of furnishing places for depositing its collections in the departments of Natural History and of the Fine Arts . Iflut it is m*inifcst that they do little , if anything , toward enlaroIn* ' the means of instruction , or supplying what we have called the " immaterial " wants of the College . Most perso us , who are not very familiar with the interior life of our // col1e*iate institutions , have no adequate idea of the amount of money which is needed to carry forward those institutions with the highest efficiency and *ucce*s . The mere cost of suitable buildings is enormous , and a very large aw ount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be necessary to answer all its demands . A simple arithmetical calculation , founded upon the cost of a single appropriate building , will convince any person of the correctness of this statement . But the wants , which are independent of these outward things , are very large . The insufficient salaries of the Colle*e officers have been already incidentally alluded to on a former page . We may refer to this matter again as an example i point . The present salaries of the l*rofessors in the Academical Department are scarcely more than half that of several of the clergymen in New Haven-those of the Professors in the other Departments are even less . The necessity laid upon these gentlemen . by reason of this fact , to do other and outside work , of course impairs their efficiency for the College , and so far hinders its highest well-being . Moreover , how are men to be called to the service of the Colle* e hereafter , when even in that most poorly paid of all the professions , the ministry , they are able to command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more comfortable support ? And , again , how is the number of Professors and teachers to be increased , as it must be in the early future , and ought to be now ? The increase of endowment , which should be adequate to the raising of the salaries of the existing Professors in the several Departments of the College , so as to be equal to those of the ministers of New Haven , would be an increase of the l ) resent funds by an amount which would surprise most persons who have not thought of the subject ; and yet this , again , is a simple arithmetical matter , and the conclusion forces itself irresistibly on the mind which once cowziders it . It is quite within bounds to say that a sum amounting to at least one-half of a million of dollars is needed for this one object alone . The increase in the number of Professorships would also require a corresponding increase in the funds of the College . And though the College may get on , as it has done , with honorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as successful as the other Colleges // which surround it , in case they are no more largely endowed ; yet it is very clear that it can not do all that it might do , and that its most devoted friends hope that it may be enabled to do in the future , unless its Professorship funds are very largely increased . The wants of the College Library have also been hinted at , on a preceding page , and are of the most pressing character . No University can accomplish its work , as it ought to be accomplished for the good of the country and the cause of education , without provision , in the way of books , for the most varied and thorough investigations in every branch of learning . The implements are wanting for the carrying forward of the work until these are supplied , and they can not be supplied without large outlays of money . There should be an annual income of some thousands of dollars for this object , instead of the small amount which can now be devoted to itonly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the pamphlet of which we have spoken , says that the scanty income at present received has been necessarily anticipated to such an extent that but few purchases , and those only of absolute necessity , can now be ventured upon . " It will be a surprise to many , " he adds , " to learn that during the last twenty years , while the cost of books has nearly doubled , and the demand arising from the growth of the College , and still more from the iucreased activity in every department of knowledge , has multiplied fourfold , the increase of the library funds is expressed by so small a traction as one-tenth . " No rich man or body of rich men could do a greater service to learning than by adding one or two hundred thousand dollars to the scanty fund on which the Library now rests . The various departments of the College , also , have peculiar needs of their own . The School of Science , which has been aided so maunificently by one of New Haven 's most liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offerings of those generous-minded men of wealth who are interested in the progress of scientific knowledge in the country . Its rapid growth and great success , during the past few years , give every promise for the future , if it can be sustained as it should he . And now that it affords not only a purely scientific education in the several departments of Natural Science , but also a general education // for those young men who do not desire to pursue a classical course , it appeals to all who are interested in establishing such a course of study in our Collegiate institutions . The Theological Department , which , during almost all its history , has been exceedingly limited in its funds , has for some years been slowly gaining in this respect , but it needs Thorn one hundred and fifty to two hundred thousand dollars , in addition to what it is now in possession ot ; in order that it may complete its new building , and may afford that pecuniary assistance to its students which will be an absolute necessity , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enable them not only to support themselves after they have entered upon their work , but to discharge the debts incurred during their education . The Law and Medical Schools are , if possible , in even more pressing need than those mentioned already . Their past efficiency can not be increased in the future , as their officers and graduates would wish it to be , unless they are provided with those abundant resources which the times demand . We have spoken briefly , and in only a general way , of some of those things which the College still requires ; and we think any one who carefully looks into the matter will feel that it is wonderfui that so great results have been accomplished in the past with so limited means , and will also feel that the numerous generous gifts which have been bestowed upon the institution within the past ten years , though amounting to nearly a million of dollars , yet leave very great and urgent necessities still unsupplied . A million of dollars more given for the increase of the means of instrifetion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , would be no more than is needed at once . The Alumni , in the past , have had only a limited ability to help the College in this way . But they are now , many of them , men of large property , and they are rapidly increasing their means with every passing year . Shall we not all remember the debt we owe to our Alma Mater ? In the suggestions which we have offered on the foregoing topics , all of which were more or less fully introduced at the late meeting in New York , we have intended to address ourselves // more especially to the graduates of the College . We have endeavored to clear away certain mistaken views which have sometimes been pressed upon their notice , and to present the subj&amp;ts referred to in the true light . We have , also , called their attention to the wants of the Institution . As members of the great company of the Alumni , we have believed that it was not unsuitable for us to speak on these important subjects , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to them has already commenced . The Alumni of Yale are her glory , even as the children of a family are the glory of their parents , and , as they are widely scattered over the land , they may do much for her prosperity if they will give to her of their substance . In the pages which follow , we desire to add a few words on one or two other subjects which are of interest to the graduates . And as the fourth point of which we speak ,  --  being partakers with them all in the blessings of the liberal education which has been so generously bestowed upon us ,  --  we are glad to assure them that , in the great controversies of the present tirne* the College takes no uncertain ground . IV . TuE IRELATION OF THE COLLEGE TO EDUCATIONAL I*EFORM . Yale College has kept pace with the times in introducing new branches of study into its system of education . The astonishing progress of the physical sciences , and the great work to be done in developing the material resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of courses oftinstruc* tion , in which these studies should have the principal place . The Scientific School , founded mainly by the munificence of Mr. Joseph E. Sheffield , meets this need . The Scientific School , we may add , is one section of the more extensive IDepartment of Philosophy and the Arts , which undertakes to provide higher instruction also in Philology , history , and Metaphysics . The small number of Bachelors of Arts who desire to pursue a post-graduate course , is the only reason that prevents this last section of the Department from assuming die prominence which has been attained by the School of Science . We do not see that Cornell University offers any superior ad // vantages , as regards the number and variety of studies and courses of study , which are provided . Without any flourish of trumpets , Yale College has met the reasonable demands of the time , in this particular , quite as fully as any other institution . But Yale has refused to take any step which implies a diminished esteem for liberal education according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classics still hold their place . The degrees that are proper to those who have pursued this course are not given to others . There is no disposition here , as far as we know , to yield to the clamor for the substitution of other branches for Greek and Latin , for the reason that this clamor is considered to spring from superficial and false ideas of education . The advantage of the new or special courses for a large class of young men , whose circumstances and plans of life render it inexpedient for them to receive a learned education , is freely conceded . But the peculiar and indispensable l ) lace of a classical training in a system of liberal education , depends on facts which man can not alter . The character of the ancient nations and their relation to the history of civilization , apart from the superior disciplinary value of the study of their languages , settles this question . To all schemes for subverting or radically altering the College curriculum , or for degrading its importance , Yale is thoroughly hostile . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the selection of studies on the part of the student ; but the optional system is not to be extended so far as to lessen materially the time that is given to the ancient languages . We regard the recent changes at Harvard as inexpedient and dangerous , so thr as they involve a departure from this canon . Everything that tends to supplant general education by special , instead of making the former the basis and preparation of the latter , is founded in a false principle , and will be productive of mischievous consequences . In nine cases out of ten , young students who choose their studies will select such as are easiest to them , and because they are easiest ; but this is a poor criterion for determining what branches it is best for them to pursue . The truth is that , generally speaking , they are incapable of determining this question for themselves . The science of education is something which they very poorly // understand . We believe that all such selections , whenever they are to be allowed , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that , in general , a prescribed course , which has been settled upon by the juigment of the most able men , and the excellence of which has been proved by the experience of the past , should be enjoined upon the whole body of the students . The great thing which our country needs is not less but more of sound learning . Instead of throwing out the classical studies , or limiting them to the briefest possible space , our Universities ought all to do what Yale has done-namely , to offer opportunities for higher and more extended cultivation of them after the ordinary Academical course is ended . V. Cnrricis*is OF THE COLLEGE . All our Colleges , of late years , seem to have been exposed to a large share of criticism . The advocates of almost every new theory of education and the different classes of persons , who think that in any respect , whether of government or discipline or instruction , they could manage these institutions better than they are now managed , hasten to present their views and complaints before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as in all others , consider the past and its wisdom of little account , and they are not content even to wait for that slow progress by which great and long-established institutions can alone be safely changed . But we are happy to believe that in regard to Yale'College , to say nothing of any other , the persons who thus criticise it , and who would transform it into something essentially different from what it has been , are not its great company of graduates . They understand too well what it once did for themselves , and what it is now doing for others , to wish it to lose its old character and glory . The men who charge it with want of sympathy with progress , or 1 ) ublic welfare , or great moral reforms , or everything that is good , are generally persons who have never seen the interior life of the College , or known the influence which has gone out from it . And while a public institution , like a private individual , can not hope to pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to censures and complaints , it may well take satisfaction , when the persons who are most familiar with it , and have lived in it as sharers in its beneficent gifts , are those whose commendation of it is warmest and most tin varying . We believe that Yale College can take to itself this feeling of satisfaction as fully as any institution of any kind which has ever been known in our country .. We doubt not , if it goes onward as it has done , that such will always be the fact . We had proposed to close our Article with some remarks on those criticisms which come from quarters where there is less information or less love for the College . But since writing that portion of it which precedes this point , we have found in a Norwich newspaper a communication signed by Professor Gilman , and relating to certain strictures respecting the College , which had gained admittance to the newspapers of that place . Not having read those strictures , we can say nothing as to the spirit in which they are conceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the remarks of Professor Gilman are so valuable in themselves , as bearing upon the class of criticisms to which we have referred , and the views which they express in regard to the system of study at Yale are so coincident with our own , that we shall quote a large part of his communication . If some thoughts differ little from those which have been presented in the preceding pages , the reader will pardon the repetition . After alluding to some things which had been said respecting the governing Board of the College , Professor Gilman proceeds as follows " It is also a judicious and a progressive body . The history of Yale College is one of the wonders of the land . how a few country ministers , ' robbing their scanty book shelves for material with which to found a College . have built up a national power ; how a few country ministers , ' with their scanty funds , have not only kept the College out of debt and out of discredit , but have made it a beacon light of truth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers ' have attracted to their graceless barracks , ' and their ill ventilated lecture rooms , scholars from every State in the Union , // from every wn 1k in life , from every denomination of Christians , and have fitted those scholars to shine on the bench , in the pulpit , and in the inventor 's laboratory , in the editor 's chair , in the Senate , in the Cabinet , and in the World of Letters ,  --  all this I say is a wonder of wonders to those who are not mindful that the country ministers ' of Connecticut are a wise , a self-sacrificing , a sagacious , a learned , and a public spirited body of men . " This Corporation , while exer*ising , in behalf of the public , a constant supervision over the affairs of the College , have a resident body of counselors in the various faculties of the College . In all great moneyed institutions , it is necessary to success that the resident managers should be vested with a large amount of power . This is especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , residents in College , giving to it all their time , are more likely to understand the College necessities than any body of nonresident trustees . Any serious change in this respect would certainly be disastrous . " Jerky , meddlesome interference with Colleges is damaging to all their interests ; the faculty , the students , and the public , all suffer . Learning is checked The education of the country is impeded . An old College like Yale should go forward , always growing wiser and better ; but it ought to go 8*eady , ' and take no steps backward . It has too much of an investment in reputation and influence to engage in extra hazardous risks . " A second complaint is that the College is losing ground by not keeping up with the spirit of the age . This has been so well answered in your columns that little remains to be said . More students , more funds , more professors , more buildings , more courses of study , more strictness of admission and of graduation , more recognition of science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other so-called modern studies , ' are certainly signs that the College is not yet losing ground . ' But the spirit of the age* in educational discussions refers , I suppose , to the recognition of modern science . INow , in this dispute , which is in progress all over the world , respecting the comparative value of scientific ' and classical // education , ' Yale College has taken no hesitating stand . She has solved the problem , wisely , harmoniously , permanently . She has now two departments , both well equipped ; first , an academic , or classical , department , where letters , or the humanities , ' are , as of old , the chief studies , with some recognition of natural science and , second , a scientific department , where the realities , ' or the various modern sciences , are the chief themes of instruction , languages and history holdin subordinate places . So that now and henceforward , at New Haven , the student may follow , at his option , the old path or the new . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; or , if he prefer , natural sciences , mathematics and the modern languages may constitute his studies . Time will decide which course is best , which course is most wanted . Both are maintained in Yale College . To me this does not seem like foolish conservatism , nor sheer old fogyism . ' It is not jerky radicalism . It is steady , judicious progress , in harmony with the movement of the age . What institution of learning in any land has more wisely marked out its course in deference not only to the spirit of the age , ' but to the spirit of the ages ? ' " The third complaint is also made that the College officers are exclusive , that they do not take a frequent part in the reforms , the conventions , the moral and religious movements of the day . There is no foundation for such insinuations , as a few facts will show . If the charges were true , it might be said in extenuation that the College professors arc overworked . Two of them , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have broken down in health . Several whose scanty salaries are inadequate to the support of their fhmilies , are hard at work , in all their supposed hours of leisure , earning a decent living . Three or four hours a day in recitation i*ooms , constant calls from students , parents and teachers , the necessamy study required to keep up with the progress of science , official and literary correspondence , the correction of written exercises and examination papers , attendance on faculty meetings-all this is enough official work for half-paid men . Moreover , within the College walls there are frequent literary , religious , and social meetings which call for sympathy , // addresses and attendance . I will only allude to the work which some of the Professors perform in vacau.t pulpits , in Mission Sunday Schools , in the Young Men 's Christian Association , in the delivery of public lectures , in ministerial and ecclesiastical councils . Besides all this , most of the College officers are at work with their pens for the advancement of science and the promotion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Science , the Journal of the American Oriental Society , and the Thedogical Eclectic , are edited by Professors in Yale College . The North American Review , the Nation , the Hearth and Home , the American Naturalist , Hours at Home , and other periodicals , receive frequent con tri butions from this same body of writers . Within a very short time past several new books have been published by officers of Yale College , and several more are known to be in the works . I state them as I rccall them , leaving others to speak of their merit . President Woolsey 's International Law , ' in a revised edition ; Dana and Brush 's Mineralogy ' ( 800 PP- Svo . ) ; Loumis 's Meteorology , ' and Algebra ( revised edition ) ; Johnson 's How Crops Grow ; ' Porter 's Human Intellect ; ' Fisher 's Life of Silliman ' and Evidences of Christianity ; Hoppin s Old England : Its Scenery , Art , and People ; ' Whitney 's Lectures on Language ; ' Hadley 's Greek Grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world as signs of the recent and present intellectual activity of the College . " It is said , however , that this implies no personal ' contact with the world . What time is left , I inquire , for such intercourse ? Very little , but that little is employed . I wish the Col lege Professors could come more into contact with the community at large . It might do both parties good , but it can not be done until every man is provided with a clerk , or with a Double , ' or till he is relieved of half of his present tasks and duties . Professor Thacher has identified himself with the cause of common schools ; Professor Northrop is prominent in the councils of the republicans ; President Woolsey is the President of the American 1-lome Missionary Society , and an efficient member of the Committee on Versions in the American Bible Society ; IDr . Bacon is a man of imiark in almost every ecclesiastical conference of this region ; the Scientific Professors are not wanting // in the national and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agricultural meetings ; the philologists are to be found in the meetings of the Oriental Society and in other philological associations . Courses of lectures are annually given to the mechanics of New Haven . In short , we can not all do everything ; but the Faculty of Yale College do not shirk their share of public service . They think their first duty is to serve the College , to do all they can to advance its usefulness and influence . After that they are ready to help along all other good social institutions . As a single illustration of their interest in moral reforms , remember how early , how unitedly , and how boldly they stood in opposition to slavery , and how much obloquy some of their number endured for their efficient zeal . " Having thus referred to the complaints which the public ' have made through your columns against the College , let me say a word about THE GREAT DUFF CT , yet scarcely referred to . It is THE DEFECT OF FUNDS . Yale College is wothily poor . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , but most of these have been for buildings , and many of them are positive taxes upon the general treasury . Meanwhile , the corps of Professors is far from being numerous enough for the work to be performed . Yale College needs more men in its faculty ; more men to teach and govern and guide its great body of students ; more men to prosecute science in all its phases ; more men to write books and lectures ; more men to influence the public . But it can not afford to pay decently those whom it has already enlisted . How can it get more ? If the Faculty were twice as large as it now is , an ( l if the men who compose it were free from anxiety for the res angusta domi , many of the detects referred to would vanish . " It is scholars who make a College ; not bricks and mortar . It is endowments which secure the time and services of scholars . Next to scholars , books are essential , but Yale College has not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tw9 years , its scanty library income having already been expended in advance . "
