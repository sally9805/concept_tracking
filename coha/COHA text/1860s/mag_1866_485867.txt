KARL Know , known to all readers of ' cycling journals , at last announces for February , 1886 , his long elaborated Ten Thousand Miles on a Bicycle ' ? not , as the title might imply , a simple record of personal adventure , but a most practical and minute guide for those who follow after in respect to roads , inns , transportation , etc. , etc . It is safe to say that it will be an indispensable book to every tourist on the wheel . The addresses of subscribers will be printed with it . Karl Kron 's address is University Building , Washington Square , New York city . Ginn &; Co. , Boston , have in press Adolf Kaegi 's Rigveda , ' translated by R. Arrowsmith ; and a Music Primer , ' by G. A , Veazie , jr . S. C. Heath &; Co. , Boston , will issue next month an American edition of Conipayre 's Fri8-toire de la Pddagogie , ' translated by W. H.

A new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the interests of the academic study of English , German , and the Romance languages , is announced to appear with the new year , under the editorial management of Prof. A. M. Elliott , aided by several of his colleagues and assistants in the Johns Hopkins University . The Modern Language Association of America , by the way , will hold its third annual meeting in Boston on December 29 , SO . T. Fisher Unwin 's ' Annual for 1885 ' is to be called The Broken Shaft , ' and will consist of seven tales and an introduction by the clever writers caught on the steamer Bavaria in the Christmas season by the accident above-mentioned . Mr. Henry Norman edits the collection , and furnishes the introduction and the seventh tale . F. M. Crawford , - R. L. Stevenson , F. Anstey , W. H. Pollock , William Archer , and Tighe Hopkins are his co-laborers . A few illustrations adorn the work . D. Appleton &; Co. will be the American publishers . Mr. Archer , by the way , has a critical study of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of Time . The second volume in Roberts Brothers ' translations from Balzac is the ? Duchesse de Langeais , ' with some smaller and ( in the original ) not savory pieces . We have also received After-Dinner Stories from Balzac , done into English by Myndart Verelst , with an introduction by Edgar Saltus ' ( New York : George J. Coombes ) . In both cases the translations are bad ? very unfaithful , we may add , without reference to the expurgations ( in the interest of Anglo-Saxon decency ) which characterize tho Boston volume particularly . On this point it can not be necessary to expatiate . That which is of the essence of an anther 's work can not honestly be sup- The Wide Awake Art Prints ' ( Boston : D. Lotbrop &; Co. ) are a set of excellent photogravure reproductions , by the new Lewis process , of original drawings and paintings originating in the Wide Awake Magazihe , and are sold at a cheap rate .

Schmidt sends us a corresponding German organ , Seemann 's Litterarischer Jahresbericht and lVeihnachtskatalog , in which-the engravings are as a rule inferior to our own , but which nevertheless employs colored inks in a way suggestive of great recklessness as to cost . The color may be uniform for text and engraving , or it may be reserved for the latter alone , and there may be more than one tint . Doubtless it is more expensive to print cuts with the care that we do in black and white , than to indulge in these fancy tints occasionally , with extra press-work . At all events a magazine like Vow Fels zuni Meer , or a catalogue like Seemann 's ( which , by the way , is printed in Roman type ) . does colorwise " what is almost never attempted among us .

Without putting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Co. ) , we may be sure that the compiler had little difficulty in finding 365 passages able to stand on their own legs , as it were , and worth committing by heart for ' their own sake  --  if that , by no means the worst use these calendars can be put to , should be attempted . The background of this particular calendar is of gilt , with a good portrait of Mr. Lowell , and a view of his ancestral Elmwood in " June , dear June , " in lively colors . From D. Lothrop &; Co. , Boston , we have a " Golden-Text Calendar , " of a Scriptural and Sunday-school cast . Freakish is the " Ruling Lights Calendar " devised by Miss E. N. Little and published ( or manufactured and sold ) by A. L. Cassino , Boston . A nickel-plated standard , with cross yoke , holds in front a lozenge-shaped mat bearing the name of the month , a landscape or other design , and some pietistic symbolism ; and at each extremity of the yoke round pasteboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so hung on rings as to permit of being turned back daily or monthly . But clearness , the first requisite in a calendar , has been lost sight of , and it would be worth one 's eyes to use this steadily . Mr. Duncan MacGregor Crerar 's poem , read before the Burns Society of this city on the 126th anniversary of the poet 's birthday , has been very tastefully printed in brown ink on rough paper by Marcus Ward &; Co . Each stanza has a leaf to itself , and the page is adorned with some view or design memorial of Burns , as his birthplace , his farm , his mausoleum , Stirling Castle , Ayr , etc. , etc .. His bold autograph is imitated on the first leaf . A blue ribbon is the only binding . The souvenir is well calculated to please the Scottish fancy . So varied are the contents of Vols. 70 , 71 of Harper 's Monthly , just received in their bound form , that they can hardly be summarized . The illustrations have fully maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Grant are preeminent , while the series representing Jersey cattle in America , the cuts after Barye 's sculpture , and the landscape views attending ( and outweighing ) Nature 's Serial Story , ' are perfection in their respective kinds . The ' Family Genealogical Record , ' issued by W. B. Clarke &; Carruth , Boston , is a compact - arrangement of blank spaces , comprehending ten generations of ancestry . It appears to us , however , inferior to the ingenious Trumbull-Whitmore ' Ancestral Tablets ' ( Boston : Cupples , Upham &; Co : ) , which , moreover , is quite as roomy as the ordinary pedigree-hunter needs . The Second part of the great ' New English Dic- - tionary , ' edited for the Philological Society by Dr. Murray ( Oxford : Clarendon Press ; New York : Macmillan ) , is now procurable . It extends from Anta to Battening . We shall speak of it in detail hereafter . It is pleasant to read of the fresh voluntary assistance rendered in the most disinterested way by scholars and authors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulness and accuracy of Part I. , Dr. Fitzedward Hall still honorably represents our country and our learning . The customary novelty in Science is for the last issue a plate of portraits- of Washington , in three groups  --  profile , nearly full face , and three- quarters  --  with . a resultant " composite " from each . That- derived from the five in the lower right-hand corner ( which range from 1785 to 1790 , and include Houdon 's bust and Trumbull 's portrait ) is quite the most satisfactory . Among the articles noteworthy are Mr. Arnold Hague 's account of the disintegration of the Central Park obelisk , under its new climatic conditions , and a discussion of a map of statures in France , the tall Gauls being those north and east of a line drawn approximately from Grenoble to Havre . Mrs. Howard Vincent , who visited this country last year , has just published an account of her travels , entitled ' Forty Thousand Miles over Land and Water . ' The information which she was able to gather is at times exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her description of Boston : " There is the old Scotch church , so famous as the political meeting-place of the Boston Tea Party ; Tancred ? Hall , the Cradle of Liberty , ' nurtured by the patriotic orations of Adams , Everett , and above all of Daniel Webster . " In another place she says : " The Toronto University is second only to Harvard on the American Continent . " This latter remark reminds us that a recent writer in a foreign journal speaks of the university at " St. Ann " s Harbour " in Michigan . The most important of the works commemorative of the revocation of the Edict of Nantes appears to be the History of the French Colony in Brandenburg , Prussia , ' recently published by the Consistory of the French Church in Berlin . It is a large . richly illustrated volume , in the preparation of which the editor , Dr. Ed . Muret. has had access to the documents preserved in the State and Refuge archives . In an appendix there are detailed accounts of each of the forty-nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the close of the seventeenth century , formed a fourth part of the population of Berlin . Striking evidence is given in it of the reviving influence which the refugees had upon education , literature , the industries , and the horticulture of Prussia , coming as they did at a time when the country was still prostrate from the effects of the Thirty Years ' War .. The contributions made to German literature by these colonists and their descendants is even still more forcibly shown in the France Protestante ' of M. Haig . This monumental work , which was first published in 1846-59 , contains not only biographies of all French Protestants of note and their descendants , but also elaborate bibliographical descriptions of their wcrks , chiefly French and German . The first part of the fifth volume of a second and greatly enlarged edition of this work , containing the letter D , has just been published in Paris . The Antiquarium of F. A. Brockhausi in Leipzig , has purchased the library of the late Professor Lepsius , of Berlin . The " first part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the works on Egyptology , has just arrived , and , as a bibliographical guide alone , is very valuable and worthy of preservation for reference . ? An inedited contemporary account of the early exploits of Joan of Arc has lately been brought to light in the archives of Rome . Examination shows that it is properly an additional chapter to the chronicle published at Poitiers in 1579 under the title Breviarium Historiale . ' Several manuscripts are extant of this work , but only one , that at Rome , contains the part relating to the Maid of Orleans . The author of the narrative is ' unknown , but theie are some indications in the text that he was an attach ? of the Court of Martin V. , and was in Rome in 1428-29 . No new facts are brought to light . Among the latest French announcements are the second series of M. Paul Bourget 's ? Essais de Psychologie Contemporaine , ' devoted to M. Dumas fils , the Goncourts , Arffiel , Turgeneff , and M. Leconte de Lisle  --  whose name , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cable-message into " Le Comte de Lisle " ; and an Etude sur Mistress Elizabeth Browning , suivie de ses quarante-quatres Sonnets portugais , et de quelques ' autres de ses poemes , traduits par Charles des Guerrois . ' M. Auguste Vita , who has been the dramatic critic of the . lrigaro for now a dozen years . has begun to collect into volumes the criticisms he ? has written from day to day , or rather froth night to night . Under the title , Les Mille et line Nuits du Theatre , ' two volumes have already appeared ( Paris : 011endorff ; New York : F. W. Christern ) , coming down to March 29 , 1874 , when the Comtesse do Sommerive " was acted in Paris not long before it was produced in New York as " Alixe . " M. Vita is not as well equipped or as acute a dramatic critic as M. Sarcey , and his articles naturally lack the judicial ' calmness of M. Sarcey 's weekly dehverances ; but they have a value of their own . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form fit for preservation . In a recent issue we inadvertently spoke of St. Paul as a great lumber-distributing ' centre . We ' should , of course , have said Minneapolis , as there is comparatively little lumber business carried on in St. Paul itself ; but these two cities are so closely connected , geographically , commercially , and socially , that it is often difficult to think of them otherwise than collectively . One or two persons have called our attention to the fact that Miss Jessie Fothergill 's Healey , ' noticed among recent novels , in No. 1064 of the Nation , , is her first book , dating in England some ten years back , and not , as we had supposed from the date of its appearance here , her latest . Our inference , therefore , of decadence on the part of ? this writer should rather be changed into the oppbsite . ? " X. " reminds us : " In your review of Ropes 's ' Napoleon L ' your reviewer has illegally promoted our late visitor , Doctor Farrar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicar of St. Margaret 's parish and also Archdeacon of Westminster , in the diocese of London . His ' deanery and even his episcopal palace may be awaiting him , but he certainly has reached neither yet . " ? lialiac , in some dithyrambic remarks on the sense of touch and on the hand as its principal implement , states that " men of strong intellect have almost always had beautiful hands , the perfeetion of Which is the distinctive index of a high destination . " In SuppOrt of this- view he instancEs a number of well-known facts in common life : Had he iive4 in tiies6 days of experiMental psychological research he would have been enabled to greatly enlarge his notions on this subject . Professor G. Stanley Hall and Doctor H. H. Donaldson , of Johns Hopkins University , who , independently of the vain , of their discoveries , deserve commendation as being among the earliest pioneers in introducing in this country the exact methods of psychologic research employed in Germany , have issued , in a separate reprint from Mind , two pamphlets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Skin , " in which a number of curious observations , partly new and partly corroborative of the discoveries of Blix , Goldscheider , and others , are recorded . These , taken in connection with the biologic fact that all our senses have their genetic origin in the external embryological layer , justify the authors in claiming that they " indicate the skin as not only the primeval and only reliable source of our knowledge of the external world , or the archmological field of psychology , but as a just-opening experimental domain of great breadth , where work seems now possible that may compare in both quality and quantity with that accomplithed , in physiological optics , and which may shed new light on some of the most fundamental problems of psychical ac-ton. and unfolding . " So little attention has hitherto been given to dermal psychology that it seems hardly strange that , even among educated persons , the notion should prevail that the " sense of touch " ? or , still more vaguely , the " sense of feeling " ? is the unique psychic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlets now before us show conclusively that not only is there a distinct and separate apparatus for touch , pressure , and temperature , but that there are distinctly localized spots on the skin , on some of which cold is felt , on others warmth , and pain , and pressure , respectively . These spots are never superposed on one another ; and a needle may , for instance ; be plunged into a cold spot or a heat spot without causing any pain . - The experiments showed that the skin between-the cold spots was not sensitive to cold ; that the points were differently distributed in different parts of the same individual , and in similar parts of different individuals ; that they were very small but permanent , so that they could always be found again ; and that- they were easily exhausted . Between the heat and pain sensations , there seems to be a certain relationship . Contrary to Weber 's statement , the oesophagus , through its entitle length , was found sensitive to temperature . ? The experiments in testing the direction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the various sensations produced are also full of interest and suggestion . With a slight electric stimulus , " for a time tickling is quite unpleasantly dominant , at other places the point seems to scratch , at others the thrilling , quivering ' sensation familiar in ' electric stimulation seems dominant , while at others sharp , sudden cutting pains , and at still others no sensations save that of a moving point , are felt . . . . It is , moreover , extremely hard to sharply differentiate and identify sensations that seem to be so impacted and run together , and which language has never before been called upon to disentangle . " One of the most interesting and novel points in these pamphlets is the showing how the progress of medicine may unexpectedly help to solve a psychological problem . Thus the discovery of cocaine has demonstrated beyond all doubt that the sensations of heat and cold are completely differentiated from touch and pain . By means of a 5 per cent , solution of muriate of cocaine , Mr. Donaldson rendered his eye completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt heat and cold . The drug had clearly paralyied one cleits of neriree , leaving the othere an , influenced . With the assistance of these researches histologists will perhaps have less difficulty than heretofore in distinguishing these nerves from one another . ? A late London Times gives an account of the nomination of the sh. , .. riffs . As this office exemplifies the old etymology honos est onus , having no pay connected with it and being subject to onerous expenses , the number of , people who with one consent began to make excuse was naturally very great . The principal reason for not wishing to serve was crippled- resources ; it is really touching to read of the long array of county gentlemen of consideration reduced to straits . Let the following serve as a specimen : " In Leicestershire a gentleman asked to be excused on the ground that since 1879 , when the agricultural depression began , his income ' had been greatly reduced ; that many of his tenants had left , and he had 1,400 acres in hand , which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , to meet a mortgage debt of 10.000 charged on the estate , and had for these purposes to borrow .214,000 ; that his principal tenant could not or would not pay his rent , and that most of lus income was absorbed in charges and expenses . " The occasion was ' furthermore interesting as being one of the most ancient ceremonies of the law , which has existed for about six centuries . The Queen 's Remembrancer attends in state costume , and reads over the names for each county ; the list i3 afterwards to be laid before the Queen for selection , " Her Majesty , " says the Times , " making her selection by pricking the list with a gold bodkin , a usage which arose , Ls Lord Campbell when Lord Chancellor told Her Majesty , in an age when kings coul ! not write their names . " Is this necessarily the reason ? Or is it not rather merely to save writing , as the Times itself suggests ? A somewhat analogous custom appears elsewhere ; once when Emperor Claudius was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's serving who had a valid excuse , and one is reminded of " pricking the Sheriffs " and the Queen 's gold bodkin by the word expungeret , punched out , pricked out , ' used by Suetonius , Claud. 15 : emu decurias reruns aria expungeret , eum , gui dissimulata vacatione quasi beneficio ltherorum , habebat responderat , ut eupidum iudicandi dimisit . ? Professor Paul Frederic% of Ghent , whose description of the systems of historical instruction in the universities of Germany and of France we have already noticed , has sent us a companion paper upon England and Scotland . As to the Scotch universities , it is almost literally true that there is no historical instruction given in them ; only two or three pages are therefore devoted to Scotland . The universities of Cambridge , Oxford , and London , on the other band , receive detailed consideration , and due credit is given to the energy and success with which historical study is pursued in them . Professors Seeley , of Cambridge , Stubbs and Freeman , of Oxford . and Beesly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have worked a marvelLus change in this branch of education ; for it is only a few years since England was as derelict as Scotland now is . Even as it is , he thinks that there is a lack , in these in ' stitutions , of study of the authorities at first hand  --  what the Germans call Quellenstudien . The assigned work seems to be too much in the line of mere reading , especially at Oxford  --  a course of reading so varied and extensive that it seems likely to result in vague and superficial knowledge . The same with the examinations . It is generally recognized that the system of written examination is carried to a greater extent in England than elsewhere  --  we have reason to believe that the English themselves are coming to think this a mistake ; and Professor Fredericq , from an inspection and comparison of the as , amination papers , comes to the conclusion that they point to a kind of work which covers too much ground , and consists too much in acquiring a large number of disconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However this may be , there is no doubt thift the younger school of historical students in England are doing excellent work , thorough in preparation and admirable in execution . Their defect is at all events just the opposite to that which Professor Fredericq criticised in Germany , where it appeared to him that the too exclusive devotion to the study of original documents , in very minute points of detail , is apt to result in the loss of broad general views and a due sense of proportion . ? Professor Fredericq has sent us another recent publication , entitled ' De Nederlanden onder Keizer Karl ' ( The Netherlands under Emperor Charles ) ; the present publication being the first part , and covering the thirty first years of the sixteenth century . It is a duodecimo of 194 pages , and consists of fourteen chapters . No less than ten of these chapters are devoted to the history of the Reformation in the Netherlands during this period , and it would appear that the Reformation had got more of a foothold there at this early date than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the conte ... porary literature , art , etc. , and of the general history of the Netherlands . The work is written in Flemish  --  essentially the same language as Dutch ; but no person who reads German need have much difficulty with this related tongue , and students of the Reformation period will find here an interesting and neglected field . ? Histories of German literature are so numerous that one would suppose the production of one was obligatory on whoever purposed setting up as a critic ; but upon closer examination one finds that , with the exception of Julian Schmidt 's , and , very recently , Wilhelm Scherer 's , they all are written by second or third-rate authors , and that one is superior to another only as respects its typography and date of issue . The real critics , such as Heine , Karl Frillebrand , Herman Grimm , and Paul Lindell , have published only monographs . The latest of these works , of which the third and concluding volume has just appeared , is by Franz Hirsch , and we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by " notices of the press , " but in a more strictly commercial fashion , namely , by sample . The reader is invited to buy the work on the strength of the author 's opinions of three writers of the day , which are given in full . The only one of the three ( Karl Bleibtreu ) for whom Mr. Hirsch has a good word , is quite unknown to us , though as he was not born till 1859 we probably shall yet have the pleasure of making his acquaintance . But the remaining two are old friends , and if Mr. Hirsch 's judgments on other authors are as " spicy " as are his views of these , we shall not wonder if his book attracts considerable attention . His first victim is " E. Marlitt , " whose " astonishing success is not due to any merit of whatever kind . Her books are a mixture of old maids ' commonplace , of middle-class lubricity , partially concealed under a mantle of phrases , " and of other things too numerous to mention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is outraged and healthy feeling corrupted , " and much more in the same strain . Judged by any but alow standard , the " Marlitt " books are certainly worthless , yet they hardly deserve condemnation so severe as this . Such criticism , however , clears the air , and it might be wmith while for responsible critics occasionally to take up our own works of a similar character , which , in spite of the high price incident to copyright protection , must , as regards sales , put to shame the most popular issues of the cheap " libraries . " Mr. Hirsch 's " third sample is devoted to Johannes Scherr , but we forbear to quote the savage attack on this ( involuntary ) historical novelist " who " knew his public well enough to achieve wide success . " ? Besides the men of science , a good many Americans will regretfully note the resignation by Sir Joseph Hooker of the directorship of that noble institution which is inadequately designated by its title , the Royal Gardens , Kew . The King 's garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III . at Kew had somehow come to be botanically notable a hundred years ago ; and , although decayed , it still preserved a certain importance and hopefulness when , in the year 1839 , it was turned over by the Crown to the Government for more public and popular as well as scientific uses , and the late Sir William Hooker was translated from the professorship and garden at Glasgow , which he had made illustrious , to the charge of the now national establishment . " Kew " has ever since meant ' Kew Gardens , with its museums and herbaria and galleries , as well as its pleasure grounds , arboretum , and conservatories . It was developed from small beginnings into the great establishment which is now of unrivalled scientific importance as well as popularity ; and all these years it has been under the direction of the Hookers , father and son , who indeed have made it what it is , and have so identified themselves with it that , just now , Kew without a Hooker will seem to be out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promotion of the assistant director , Mr. Dyer , places the establishment in the charge of a man of tried scientific as well as administrative ability  --  one , moreover , who , although he came without such ties , is connected by marriage with the Hookerian family . ? Still more pleasant and most important it is to know that this change which the late Director has decided upon , while still vigorous and of undiminished powers , is merely from administrative to more strictly scientific work , that he may prosecute more steadily and hopefully the botanical undertakings which he has in hand , and which are enough to task all the energies of a younger man , but which yet demand  --  as such work does  --  all the various knowledge and critical tact and sureness of judgment which comes only with long experience . And here let us record our dissent from the doctrine of Huxley 's playful suggestion that every scientific worker should commit the happy despatch when he reaches the age of sixty years ; that before this he will have done all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more likely to hinder than to help the progress of original scientific research . It is true enough that the older men will not be likely to strike out new lines or discover new principles , but the advance guard fights only a small part of the battle . If the veteran has ever done . good work in his younger days , and has followed 1.1 up with the steady devotion that wins , he has not only acquired a deal of judgment , but has laid out more work than he can ever hope to accomplish , yet which no one else is likely to do so well , or at least so readily . Therefore let us hope still for years of excellent fruit-bearing in age by the retired President of the Royal Society and from his predecessor , the retiring Director of Kew . ? Readers to whom the story of the Waldensian revolt against Rome possesses perennial interest will find much food for thought in the Hiscoire Litt6raire des Vaudois du Pidmont , ' by Edouard Montet ( Paris : Fischbacher , 1885 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the same field will be prepared to find in it a work of solid erudition and Sound criticism . The labors of Dieckhoff , Herzog , Bradshaw , and others have already served to dissipate the nebulous antiquity with which Perrin and L4ger had succeeded in investing the development of the Waldensian faith , but it was reserved for M. Montet to give a conscientious examination and collation of all the remains of its literature preserved in the collections of Geneva , Strassburg , Cambridge , and Dublin . Although these are not as abundant as could be wished , they are sufficient to show how slow was the growth of what we are accustomed to regard as distinctively Waldensian doctrines , and how long the sectaries clung to the church which recognized them only to exterminate them . To indicate this has required close and laborious investigation and comparison , for the details of the subject are intricate , but M. Montet possesses the true historical instinct , together with the literary ability to present his results in a clear and perspicuous manner . No one hereafter can pretend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assistance of this compact resume of the spiritual life of the martyrs of Angrogna and Val Louise .
