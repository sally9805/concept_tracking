ART . VII . -1 . The American Crisis considered . By CHARLES LEMPRIERE , D. C. L. , of the Inner Temple , late Fellow of St. John 's College , in the University of Oxford . London . 1861. 2 . The American Union . By JAMES SPENCE . London . 1861. 3 . Les Etats Unis en 1861 . Un Grand Peuple qui se reh*ve . Par le COMTE AGENOR DE GASPARIN . Paris : Michel L6vy Fr*res. 1861 . WE propose to ourselves the somewhat ungracious task of examining the contrast , which all must have noted , between the French and the English method in the discussion of the present troubles in the United States . In both countries , the interest in the American question has been absorbing . This interest is especially remarkable in France , where we have seen torpid journals , with the life half crushed out of them by the long-continued pressure of imperial supervision , plunging day after day into all the complicated political and social questions to which it gives rise , and treating them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a life and vigor which seem to show how much they rejoice in an opportunity of talking politics with freedom , even though it be but foreign politics ; - while in England the leading columns of the innumerable periodicals , high and low , Whig and Tory , daily , weekly , monthly , and quarterly , are filled with the speculations and prophecies of interested journalists , now calm and authoritative , now heated and violent , and once in a while earnest and friendly ; and , as if this were not enough , at the rate of about two each month , more ambitious essays are published , in the shape of octavo volumes , claiming each to exhaust the subject up to the date of its issue . We have placed at the head of this article the titles of three books , two English , and one French , which we think may fairly stand as exponents of the prevailing sentiment in the two countries ; and if we give a brief sketch of their contents , and indicate in some degree the views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall perhaps be doing some service to those who believe in the unanimity of European opinion on American affairs . // Of the two English books we may say that , had they been published anonymously , we should have confidently pronounced them to be the work of men with whose views and manner of expressing them we all had had occasion to be more than sufficiently familiar . Mr. Lempriere 's book we should have assigned to the Hon. Mr. Wigfall , late Senator from the Commonwealth of Texas , - or to the Hon. Mr. Keitt , late Representative from the sovereign State of South Carolina , - so much has it the air of a compilation from the speeches of those types of a class of statesmen who once ruled the nation , and have now departed from its councils , we trust forever . Mr. Spence 's book we should have accredited to Mr. J. ID . B. De Bow , whose Review it emulates in ' its aversion to figures , - or perhaps , in a more generous mood , to Mr. Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity in making white appear black , and black white . But as the great seats of English learning have not yet gone so far in their appreciation of our Southern brethren as to bestow fellowships upon them , and furthermore , as one of the books bears on its title-page a name which of late has become somewhat noted in the commercial circles of so great a port as Liverpool , we are forced reluctantly to deprive the new Confederacy of the credit of a literary beginning so distinguished , and to add these to the number , already large , of the extraordinary contributions to political knowledge with which English writers have favored us within the short period of our domestic troubles . To have obtained the fellowship and the degree which are announced on the title-page copied above , Mr. Lempriere must necessarily be a man of some education and of some culture . It is in this view alone that we can feel ourselves justified even in the shortest notice of a book , of which , in this view , the ignorance and vulgarity are absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrate these qualities sufficiently without the need of any comments upon them . On page vi . of the Introduction he speaks of " the coercion and abolition which has been the policy of the leading portion of the Northern statesmen for the last twenty years . " On page 2 he finds " a right of resist // ance " to the authority of a newly elected administration , Ka the legislative action of the several States , or of the whole coinbined , in Senate and Congress . " " Nor is it any answer to say that the President , being duly elected according to law , became ipso facto governor of the country . He did not , until he was accepted by the legislatures both of the separate States and of the whole combined , which we know has never been the case . " On page 96 he says : " The North , by a systematic and violent attack on the property , and even lives , of their fellow-citizens , forced them into an attitude of defence . The armed and fierce action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to arms , and on them is the heavy onus . " We give these passages as examples of the author 's ignorance , because it is less unpleasant than to assume them to have been deliberately published with a knowledge of their falsity , - which is the only alternative . As an example of the other quality which we specified , we give this passage from the chapter in which the author reviews the Letter of Mr. Motley to the London Times : " Englishmen know that the oft-repeated assertion that the Republican party , in its desire to set bounds to the extension of slavery , had no design , secret or avowed , against slavery in the States , ' is a palpable , patent , and wicked lie , - and the noble and generous desire of all parties in the free States to vindicate the sullied honor of their flao* ' is mere bunkum to get him the loaves and fishes , which we see Mr. Motley has posted off to Washington to secure . " These extracts , taken at random , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " late Fellow of St. John 's College " has produced , and any further notice of it is as unnecessary as it is distasteful . Mr. Spence 's book is of quite another character , and we shall notice it more at length . The author is a Liverpool merchant of distinction , - a loyal subject of King Cotton , - and was chairman of the excited meeting held by his fellow-subjects in the Cotton-sales room , in response to the placards of the Secessionist emissaries , on the day of the arrival in England of the news of the seizure of Mason and Slidell on board the Trent . The sound and fury of that meeting our readers will no doubt remember , and also the manner in which the // good sense of some of its speakers stepped in to modify the absurdity of its resolutions . The report of the meeting which was sent to the London Times concluded with this quiet remark : " At the conclusion of the meeting , which was at four o'clock , a number of the older merchants on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been premature . " The chairman 's book had been given to the press some three weeks previously , judging from the date of its Preface , and he must have sorely regretted his inability to introduce into that publication the additional element of popularity which it would have gained by the discussion of so interesting a topic as the seizure of the rebel emissaries , and the " affront to the British flag . " We have said that Mr. Spence 's book is of quite a different character from that of Mr. Lempriere . It is different , however , not in its conclusions , but in its manner of treating the subject , and in its temper . It is calm throughout , and respectably well written , with a vein of philosophy running through its discussions , and a continued profession of the most friendly sentiments , which , even in their expression , seem to attach rather to the country , geographically considered , than to the inhabitants . " What desire has any one here , except to see that great country the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the human breast than love of kindred . " And again : " Personal considerations and valued friendships incline me without exception to the Northern side . " These he has so far successfully resisted as to be able to say , at the beginning of the Preface , what is fully justified by every chapter which follows : " Lest the neutral title of the present work should beguile the reader to assume that neutrality of opinion will pervade it , I warn him at once , on the threshold , that he will soon encountei* a current of reasoning strongly adverse to the present doctrine and action of the Northern party . " After a Preface of which this is the key-note , the book opens with a chapter on the political institutions of the United States , of which the aim is to prove these institutions defective in theory and destructive in practice , - unphilosophic in themselves , and wholly unsuited to the needs of so large and populous a country . Its reasoning is in many instances ingenious , and its quotation of // American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear case of special pleading throughout , and the argument , as a whole , entirely fallacious . He assumes , for instance , that the population of the United States is not homogeneous ; each State having marked peculiarities of custom and interest , and a patriotism more or less limited to its own borders ; - and then , after enumerating the various instances of the formation of confederacies in history , he says : " Certainly , in every other instance on record , federal republicanism , where the component states have had the dimensions of powers and not of provinces , has proved a signal failure . " But this is precisely what was not the case with the parties to the Constitution of 1789 . Not one of the thirteen Colonies had ever even claimed the dignity of a " power , " or had possessed for a day any other nationality than that represented by the government at London or the Continental Congress. * Through all the vicissitudes of party violence since that time , the instances in which State pride has been invoked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inconspicuous , in the face of the steady adherence to the federal government and respect for its laws , that the argument would fall to the ground at once , had it not the apparent countenance of the present sharply-defined division . This circumstance , however , fails to give it any real weight , because the division follows so closely the line of demarcation between slavery and freedom , and because when that line disappears , and the anomalous interest which created the rebellion shall have happily ceased to exist , there will remain absolutely nothing to prevent the thirty-four States from becoming as completely " homogeneous " as the eighteen free States are to-day . All will admit that , with the possible exception of France , there is not a nation in Europe which possesses the desirable quality implied by that extremely awkward word in as great a degree as the Northern United States . Yet if difference of commercial , manufacturing , and agricultural interests , - if diversity in laws regulating internal affairs , - if the strongest contrasts in // tastes , habits , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Climate and geographical position among a people stretching from the Atlantic to the Rocky Mountains , ay , and thence to the Pacific , - could alienate one portion of such a people from another portion , or distract or divide the allegiance which all should bear to the central government , should we have seen , almost within the limits of a single generation , the rapid and continual advance of this people westward , and the formation of State after State from the wilderness of yesterday , each with its own conscious future bright with the promise of strength and vigor , and all without a whisper in one of them of any other ambition but to be soonest admitted a loyal member of the great family of States , and farthest to advance the general welfare and glory ? Does any intelligent man , honest at the same time , believe that anything has prevented a similar exhibition of good faith and honorable ambition in the States which have been admitted south of that illomened line , but the adoption of a domestic theory and policy which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which nothing honest or worthy ever can be or ought to be " homogeneous " ? It is a fair question , if any institutions other than the freest and most enlightened could have existed for seventy years under such a burden . Mr. Mill , in his admirable book on " Representative Government , " says : " In America , all the conditions for the maintenance of union exist at the highest point , with the sole drawback of difference of institutions on the single but most important article of slavery . " He might have added , that , if the North had believed slavery to be a permanent and unalterable fact in the Southern States , there would have been but one answer to any demand of the South for a separation , and that would have been , " Go , in Heaven 's name , and relieve us at least of the weight you choose to carry . " It was because the recognition of slavery as a transient evil was universal , and the difference of opinion was on the single question how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the greatest certainty the perils which must follow premature or unwise legislation , that the North has borne and forborne even to the end , of which we trust we already see the beginning ; and if Mr. Spence were but half 35* // as candid and friendly as he professes to be , he would see and acknowledge that the examples of the old federations of history - which have been formed for purposes of offensive or defensive warfare , out of states which had possessed separate nationalities for ages , and have fallen asunder when the special ends for which they united had been more or less completely answered - have no just parallel in the formation , history , and growth of the United States . Mr. Spence tells some mournful truths in regard to our national defects of character and manners , of which we are only too conscious , and whose existence we must frankly admit . We have never assumed , except perhaps in the inflated utterances of our Fourth of July celebrations , that the great machinery has worked perfectly as yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members . The regime which still excludes from the highest places the worthiest men ; the lack of dignity and elevation in the proceedings of Congress ; the savage and sordid avarice which governs the system of " rotation in office " ; the prevalence of the shameless and detestable business of " lobbying , " - all these abuses , and more as bad , still continue to mortify our just pride , and to make us painfully aware that much wisdom and labor are yet to be given to the work of perfecting our republican system . But it is by no means certain that all or most of these abuses are peculiar to that system . Most of them , we think , may be recognized , under varying conditions , not always equally conspicuous , in all forms of government , from democracy to despotism . But it is the fortune of a republic , whether for good or ill we need not say , that its defects are visible and conspicuous ; while under a despotism the deadliest influences may be at work at the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterior of the court . Very nearly all the abuses which Mr. Spence is so fond of exhibiting were in full flower when IDe Tocqueville was in the country , and his intelligent mind did not fail to observe and to deplore their existence ; yet they did not prevent his writing these words to a friend in France , which do not sound much like the words of one who feared for the stability of the fabric he had come to examine : " Christianity rests // here upon a firmer basis than in any other country that I know , and I have no doubt that the religious element influences the political one . It induces morality and regularity ; it restrains the eccentricities of the spirit of innovation ; above all , it is almost fatal to the mental condition so common with us , in which men leap over every obstacle , per fas et nefas , to gain their point . " * After all , perhaps the best claim we can make for our institutions is that they provide for their own amendment whenever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be satisfied of the need . The first chapter closes with an emphatic condemnation of the rule by which the Cabinet ministers have no place or voice in Congress ; and Mr. Spence 's remarks on this topic seem to us so just , that we venture to quote them at length , and to say further that the subject is one which might at a proper time be advantageously considered by the government and people . " We have seen that , under the system in force , ability is excluded from the highest office in the state ; there is another cause which very largely excludes it from the legislative chambers . The ministers are not permitted to take part in the proceedings of Congress . To judge of the effects of this , we have only to imagine the result of excluding the whole of the ministry from the House of Commons . The men who of all others have access to the sources of information , who are thoroughly conversant with details , and who possess the requisite experience and ability to guide the debates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within its walls . And this deprivation of ability is a small evil compared with others that result . Who can put a question to a minister who is never there to he questioned ? There is a complete absence of that sharp and effective responsibility to the people through their representatives which we should hardly like to exchange for a system of secret management of the House by parties who can never be seen face to face . Thus no minister can introduce and explain his own measure , he must do so second-hand . He can not be made to avow his own opinions , - no responsibility can be fixed upon him . He must work the business of the government through private arrangement with members of the House , and use patronage to supply the place of ability or knowledge . We have some impatience of the // very idea of what is called back-stairs influence , ' and what shall we say to a system in which the whole business of the government is conducted on the back-stairs principle , and where , indeed , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here is some exaggeration , no doubt , but the objection has force , and the views are those of every British writer who has had occasion to introduce the topic . Hallam , in his " Constitutional History , " speaking of the threatened exclusion of the ministers from the House of Commons , in 1693 , says : " Such a separation and want of intelligence between the crown and Parliament must have destroyed the one and weakened the other . It is one of the greatest safeguards of our liberty , that eloquent and ambitious men , such as aspire to guide the councils of the crown , are from habit and use so connected with the Houses of Parliament , and derive from them so much of their renown and influence , that they lie under no temptation , nor could without insanity be persuaded , to diminish the authority and privileges of that assembly . " The present is no time for attempting reforms in the Constitution or customs of the House of Representatives ; but we hope the day is not far distant when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom and all the strength of the nation shall leave its wisest minds at liberty to take such topics into consideration . In the chapter which follows , professing to treat of the effects of the institutions of the country on the national character , our author records a great variety of hasty judgments , made up at a distance of three thousand miles from the scene of action , chiefly from false or exaggerated newspaper accounts , and not in any case , so far as we can guess , froni personal study or from authentic information , all agreeing in the main point , quod erat demonstrandum , that very little , if anything , is left in the United States , either of institutions or people , that is worth preserving . Here are a few examples of these decisions : - " It is the established practice of the country , in the face of ample records of the facts , wilfully to pervert its own history , in order to satisfy this desire for exaggeration . It is not easy to imagine a more deplorable spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge and forming // their opinions on the exaggerations of declaimers , each striving to outvie his predecessors . " ( p. 50 . ) The authority for this generalization is an account of a Fourth of July Oration which Miss Martineau once heard and described . Again : " The Union has now a Paris . Whoever has studied the progress of the momentous events now occurring will have seen that the Washington government simply follows the impulse of the people ; but the people of the North , in their turn , implicitly follow the lead of New York . Whatever decision is formed there flies over the land by telegraph , and is adopted before the day is out . " ( p. 5T . ) The collision between the civil and military authorities in the Merryman case , the seizure by the government of the telegraphic records , the confiscation of rebel property , and certain unfortunate acts of violence in New York and elsewhere during the excited days of April , are of course pressed into service , as conclusive evidence that , " whatever may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has become a thing of the past . " ( p. 60 . ) The assault on Mr. Sumner in the Senate , ( the fact of the assailant being a Representative from South Carolina is forgotten , ) and the murder of the District Attorney at Washington by a New York Representative , are cited as natural results of the political system ; and while the former is described as having occurred " in open session , " the latter is said to have been rewarded by " the adoption of the murderer as an object of public sympathy and admiration , " and his elevation to the rank of Brigadier-General in the Northern army . These we cite as instances of the way in which Mr. Spence , by a skilful study of the " art of putting things , " is enabled to give the impression he wishes to convey without often resorting to direct falsehood . His inquiry into the causes of disruption is ingenious and plausible , and one which might have been made and promulgated by Jefferson Davis as a public document , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , entirely unjust to the character and motives of the North , which so slowly and timidly advanced to the election of Mr. Lincoln , it makes an assumption of fairness and candor which is ill sustained by the entire absence of any allusion to the condition of the rebellious States , which has made it for years past // a more dangerous thing for a Northern man with Northern principles to travel freely in South Carolina or Alabama than in Madagascar , - ill sustaiiied by the ready forgiveness of such crimes as blacken the records of the Buchanan Cabinet , by the elaborate argument for the inferiority of the negro race , by his abuse of the Abolitionists , by his assertion that " the present contest is not ( on the part of the South ) for the furtherance of slavery , " and his arraignment of the North ( just enough by itself ) for the protection and favor it has bestowed upon that institution , and by his claim for the " superior iiitellectual culture of the South . " The anti-slavery feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Democrat supports slavery , - the object of the Republican is to defeat the Democrat , - therefore lie must needs object to slavery as a party matter . " A precedent for the present rebellion and its proper treatment is found in the Nullification Act of South Carolina in 1832 , on which occasion he declares that " the State was right so far as justice was concerned , " and that " the fact is admitted by the ablest Northern writers of the present day , " and was so far admitted by Jackson and the Congress , that a conciliatory policy was adopted toward the rebellious State , and " a measure for the removal of the grievance was introduced by Mr. Clay , and " pushed through with unprecedented rapidity , by an evasion of the rules . " Such are the tone and manner of this inquiry , which closes with the declaration ( p. 246 ) , that " secession is a just and clear constitutional right of the States , and no violation of any enactment of the federal compact . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle for the preservation of the Union , in which the blunders and misstatements are so thick-set that we can only indicate a few of the most flagrant . The advantages of the conflict are found to be almost wholly with the South , - the numerical and financial superiority of the North being counted rather unfavorable than otherwise . The industrial conditions in the South are greatly in its favor ; - the rebels are rich in internal resources , and if they were poor , all the better ; " history affords ample evidence that the absence of wealth has proved no barrier to the defence of an invaded country . " // ( p. 255 . ) Again , the discipline of the troops is much more easily maintained in the Southern than in the Northern armies . " The Northerner will obey with impatience under feelings of restraint that seek escape , - his position is repugnant to all his former theories , - impatient of control as a child , it is impossible he can be docile under the bonds of discipline The Southerner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether to command or to obey , as the proper order of things . " ( p. 261 . ) The blockade is unconstitutional as well as foolish . England blockaded France twenty years , and in the midst of it all France achieved her greatest triumphs . It may be injurious to the South , " but to the North disastrous in the end , " - by stimulating privateering , which may become an intolerable nuisance to Northern trade , - by paralyzing the Northern manufactures , and leading in the end to the interference of foreign powers . ( p. 273 . ) The reduction of Charleston is well nigh impossible , and useless if accomplished . The Mississippi expedition is ludicrous , because troops can not be sent in the river boats , and to construct a flotilla which could face artillery , and at the same time convey the requisite number of troops , would be the work of years . He pronounces the emancipation of the slaves " an impotent act of vengeance , " says that the proclamation of Fremont " copies the ferocity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiant speech of Mr. Iverson of Georgia in the Senate , last winter , He scoffs at the idea of any natural friendship between England and the Northern States , gives a rancorous sketch of the numerous offences committed by us against the dignity and interest of Great Britain , and concludes finally that " the attempt to subdue the Southern country and people is a lamentable delusion , attempted not as the decision of calm judgment , but the rash result of that unreasoning excitement to which the people of the North are now subject , " and that his " clear conviction " is " that nothing is more essential to the real welfare of the American people than a termination of the American Union . " After spending so much time in this somewhat tedious review of the book of Mr. Spence , it will be unnecessary to make any extended remarks upon its merits . This is rendered all the more needless by the transparent character and // aim of the book , which is a singularly characteristic illustration of the curiously divided duty which the manufacturing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes , his feelings , his natural sympathies , all incline him decisively to the Northern side - that is to say , to the national side - of the question ; but his manufacturing and commercial instincts are stronger than tastes , or feelings , or sympathies , and determine irresistibly the direction of his support . So , while declaiming with fine emphasis against slavery , he opens wide arms of welcome to the envoys of the Confederacy which declares slavery to be its corner-stone . So , while complaining bitterly of the long series of insults and injuries which England has borne at the hands of America within a generation , he carefully forgets that the men who , if any , instigated those indignities are now the traitors , of whose cause he is willing to become the advocate and patron . And as the typical Englishman is unmistakably manufacturing and commercial , it follows that the national bent , in a case like the present , is precisely that which finds just and clear expression in the book before us . We do not wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England within the past year which take precisely the opposite ground , and recognize with perfect candor and freedom the magnitude of the issue , and the justice of the Northern cause . But no man can believe , in the face of all that has been written and spoken in England since the commencement of our troubles , that such books represent the people of Great Britain ; and he must have studied human nature to little purpose who , in reading the books and the journals which do represent it , feels any lasting wonder at the warmth of their sympathy with the rebellious South , or at the misrepresentations and calumnies in which they indulge toward the loyal North . Let us now turn , and we confess to an infinite relief in doing so , to a brief analysis of the work of M. de Gasparin , of which a short notice was contained in a former number of this Review , but which , from the character of its author , as well as from its own merits , deserves a more emphatic judgment than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Its author has never travelled in America , and is known here chiefly by // his book on Slavery and the Slave*trade , * a serious and earnest work devoted to the advocacy of emancipation in the French West Indies , according to a plan proposed and elaborated with much thought by the author , and which bore on its title-page this motto from the Italian theatre , of which the application was at once felicitous and pungent - " Ricardo . - lo nol posso - Giorgio. - Tu non vuoi . " M. de Gasparin , after the publication of this work , labored diligently with pen and voice for the accomplishment of this worthy end , until he had the happiness of seeing his labors meet with substantial success . Since the re-establishment of the Empire , he has lived , for the most part , in a dignified retirement , - of which Miss Bremer , in her last-published book , gives us a pleasant glimpse , - interested in whatever social or political movement seems to promise any real advance in the halting and irregular march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite free from the inevitable errors and misapprehensions of an author who writes of a country he has never seen , and of a people he has never studied face to face . Also , in the quick march of events since the book was published , many of its speculations have quite lost their value , except as records of the extraordinary excitement and bewilderment of the public mind which made them possible ; and it is a noticeable fact , that this book , of which the Preface is dated " Orange , March 19 , 1861 , " already seems more like a production of the past than did the work of De Tocqueville two years ago . But the errors we can overlook , and the speculations , whether verified or disproved by subsequent events , never formed the chief value of the book , which seems rather to consist in its generous enthusiasm for a noble cause ; in its singular freedom from any tinge of political bigotry ; in its joyful and almost triumphant perception of the greatness of the movement by which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to establish on a firmer foundation than ever before the great principle of self-government and the supremacy of constitutional law ; and in its recognition . * Esciavage et Traite . Paris . 1838. // of the fact that the struggle and agony of the conflict , far from being taken as evidence of approaching dissolution , should be regarded as evidence of new life , and a promise of renewed strength and health . " On vient de sauver les Etats Unis ! " he cries , with ardor , - I repeat it with profound and deliberate conviction , - " the United States have been saved . " And here is the point upon which the author takes issue with those in his own country , and elsewhere in Europe , who read the signs of the times as indicating the speedy ruin of the republic whose growth and development had for three generations not ceased to astonish and puzzle them . The croakers are always the most numerous body whenever a government or an individual is overtaken by disaster , and never hesitate to predict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this case our author assures these prophets of ill , with a confidence equal to their own , that they are to be disappointed , - that the patient is young and vigorous , that the greatest danger is past , and the future full of hope . Let us here give his own words . " The common opinion is that the progress of the United States ceased with the election of Mr. Lincoln , and that since that period they have only declined . It is not difficult , and it is very necessary , to prove this opinion to be entirely false . Before the recent victory of the opponents of slavery , the American Union , spite of its material progress and its apparent prosperity , was suffering from a dreadful disease , which was very near proving fatal ; - now an operation has been performed , the pain has increased , and the gravity of the situation reveals itself for the first time , perhaps , to careless eyes . Shall we say that the situation was not grave until it seemed so ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cure was possible ? I do not deplore , - I admire ! I recognize in this vigorous reaction against the disease the moral health of a people accustomed to the laborious struggles of liberty . Such an uprising of a people is one of the most rare and marvellous spectacles to be found in the annals of the race . Commonly , nations which have begun to waver lean constantly more and more to their fall . It is a rare vitality indeed which enables one to recover itself and stand erect after the decline has once begun Till lately the United States were marching straight to their ruin . Till lately we had enough to lament in thinking of them , - we could count the steps which they had yet to take , to complete the alliance of their destiny with that of an accursed institution which deserves only to perish , // - of an institution which corrupts and destroys all that it touches . To-day a new prospect is opened to them ; - there must be struggle , labor , suffering ; the crime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day ; the path of national justice once lost is not to be regained without effort ; a nation can not , more than a man , break away without sacrifice from guilty traditions and the complicities of ages , but it is nevertheless true that the hour of effort and of sacrifice , painful as it may be , is yet the hour of deliverance . The election of Mr. Lincoln will be one of the great points of American history , - it closes the past , but it opens the future . With it has commenced , if only the same spirit be maintained , - if excessive concessions shall not succeed in undoing what has been done , - a new order of things , at once more pure and more great than that which has come to an end . " - pp. 3-6 . This is very noble . Our enemies , foreign and domestic , would say it is too enthusiastic to be philosophical , and would extend their objection to the whole of the book , which is pervaded throughout by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prefer the honest enthusiasm of friendship to the calmness which proceeds from the calculations of a selfish ambition , and of which we have seen so admirable examples in the treatises with which the London Times has favored us for some months past , as well as in some of the oldest and most respectable of the quarterlies of Great Britain . As our friendly author gracefully says ,  --  " The side which is beautiful is often the side which is true ; if the eyes of Love are bandaged , I perceive a triple bandage over the eyes of Hate . Charity has its privileges , and I do not think myself less favorably placed than another for judging the United States because they inspire me with a thoughtful sympathy , or because , having mourned over their faults and trembled at their perils , I have joyfully hailed the noble and manly policy of which the election of Mr. Lincoln was the symptom . " That the enthusiasm of M. de Gasparin is not the blind partiality of a partisan , and that his eyes are as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American people , take the following passage as proof : - " I do not admire vulgarity , and I do not admit that it is the necessary companion of energy ; the tone of the public journals , and that of the debates in Congress , are often such as to excite a just reprobation. // There is also in the United States a tendency to level downward ( un nivellement par le bas ) , a jealousy of acquired superiority , and especially of hereditary distinctions , which proceeds from the worst feelings of the heart . What is still more serious , the more kindly and tender side of our nature , that which shines in the pages of the Gospel , is too seldom seen among this people , with whom , nevertheless , that Gospel is held in reverence , but in whom the labors incident to so enormous a growth have developed the active virtues at the expense of the more amiable . The Americans are cold ( secs ) , even when they are good , benevolent , and religious ' The author makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those men in the North who have been its advocates and supporters . Some of these still remain in the sheltering obscurity and tolerance of our Northern cities , and by such the book is doubtless set down as the work of a " fanatic " and a " man of one idea . " Nothing could be farther from the truth . Slavery he sees and declares to have threatened for more than one generation the ruin of the nation . In the defeat of slavery at the last election he recognizes the cause , and the only cause , of the rebellion , and in the uprising of the loyal North against the rebellion he reads the approaching doom of that ancient enemy of civilization , and the beginning of the reign of real freedom . It is the old cry of the Marshal of France , " Le roi est mort , - vive le Roi ! " This , it is true , is the theme and burden of the whole melody , and with it is mingled so much of cordial good-will and of congratulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so great a movement , that it is hard to see how any American whose loyalty is more than a pretence can read this book without some emotions of gratitude to a friend who sends us such words of lofty cheer in a time of need . As we have said , a considerable portion of the work is given to the direct consideration of slavery in its character of chief conspirator , and of the questions which must arise either from its failure or its success in achieving its desired independence . But throughout this discussion , though the tone is earnest and zealous to a remarkable degree , there is yet no trace of faiaticism or of bitterness . He is always ready to acknowledge the natural influence of birth and education upon the // opinions of those in the South who labor for the support and extension of their favorite system , and to confess the probability that the best of those whose wrath is excited by their misdeeds might , with similar precedents , have been similarly guilty . " Severity is almost always a fault of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin by forgetting our own history . We Frenchmen , who have with such difficulty freed our own slaves , - we who have tried to repeal in part , by our colonial regulations , the liberty once granted to the blacks , - who have allowed the recruiting by purchase on the coast of Africa , - nay , who once organized an expedition charged with the duty of re-establishing slavery and the slavetrade in San Domingo , - we whose conscience is burdened with these misdeeds , are bound to use all possible consideration toward the States of the South . " ( p. 111 . ) A single extract like this is surely sufficient to remove any suspicion of fanaticism , - a reproach which has in this country been so often and persistently misapplied as to have become almost synonymous with steadfastness and honest self-devotion , - and the same spirit of Christian tolerance and forgiveness is to be noticed throughout the whole work . We have dwelt so long on the tone and temper of this book , that we have left ourselves space only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapters are taken up with the development and proof of the proposition laid down in the Preface , and which we have quoted above . The succession of reasoning is clearly enoi*gh indicated to us who know the sad history by heart , by the titles of the chapters - I. American Slavery ; II . Whither the United States were going before the Election of Mr. Lincoln ; III . What that Election signified ; IV . What must be thought of the United States ; V. The Churches and Slavery ; VI . The Gospel and Slavery . Of these six chapters the conclusion is briefly this , - that the position which the North took in the election of 1860 , and took just in time , was delayed by many causes , chief among which were the apathy of the great religious bodies on the subject of slavery , and the direct interest which the commercial cities felt in its continuance , and that it was in spite of the opposition of these two great forces , theology and commerce , that 36* // the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it if yet there were time . They made the effort , and " the nation was saved . " All this seems very trite , no doubt , to one who has been steeped for years in the bitterness and intensity of these discussions ; but let us not forget that , up to this time , even the cultivated classes of Europe have had but the dimmest possible ideas on the subject of American politics , and that , if we care for their opinion , it is important that they should be enlightened as to the facts . It is this service that M. de Gasparin has performed for us , with a clearness and point which most American writers would have found it hard to excel . Having in the first half of the book given this succinct historical review , he devotes the remainder to the consideration of the actual crisis and its probable consequences . Here let it be remembered that the book was published at a time when only six of the eleven rebellious States had declared their treason , and before the attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , with the most remarkable precision in the statement of facts up to the time of writing , the author had slight grounds for judgment as to the probable issue of the troubles which were then but just beginning . This he frankly confesses , disclaiming at the outset any pretensions to the gift of prophecy . He nevertheless attacks the future courageously , and after a rapid survey of the condition of affairs at the time of the inauguration , including a scorching review of the conduct of Mr. Buchanan and his Cabinet of traitors during the four months previous to that event , and expressing the utter astonishment with which all foreign eyes beheld the mad race of the South in their road to ruin , he makes a very clear and succinct statement of the argument for the right of secession , exposing its utter fallacy , and imagining the condition of a confederacy of states which should start with a pronounced avowal of this right , and where each state would always be able to hold over the others the threat of separation in case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , would be like those old horse-back Diets of Poland , where a single contrary vote brought everything to a dead-lock , so that there was no alternative but to finish the voting by sabrestrokes . He figures the great slave empire which rises in the // heated imaginations of the Southern leaders , " stretching from the Delaware to the Uraguay , - a colossal negro-jail , continually supplying itself by a slave-trade not less colossal , - the barracoons filled once more on the coast of Africa , the hunting of fugitives organized on a scale hitherto unknown , - squadrons of slave-ships transporting their wretched cargoes under the Southern flag , proudly spread to the breeze ; - such is the project in its majestic unity ; such the dream which the extreme South once hoped to realize through its union with the North , and which it now hopes to realize through a separation . " ( p. 189 . ) Our author proceeds to show the manner in which the attempt at carrying out this scheme would prove ultimately fatal to its originators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever the present programme , which is from the necessity of the case merely temporary , should be rendered useless . By the revival of the foreign slave-trade the domestic and internal traffic between State and State would nearly cease , while at the same time the price of slaves must fall , causing heavy loss to planters throughout the confederacy . Hence would surely arise a radical division of interest , and consequent dissensions . A new South and a new North would be formed ; - " they believe themselves united , - they proclaim themselves united , up to the inevitable moment when they discover that they have neither the same object nor the same spirit : nothing divides like a bad cause which turns out badly . " Next , the filibustering by which the territorial extension must be effected , if at all , would provoke the direct interference of foreign powers , predisposed to interference by natural disgust at the creation of a nation with such a programme . The extreme poverty of the South , the impossibility of sustaining any practicable system of revenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain causes of decline and of dissension . Finally , the influence , direct and indirect , of the Northern Sta4*es , with their free institutions , coupled with the varying interests of the various tiers of slave States , - these producing , those consuming , - would in a few years insure the return of the border States to the old Union , and the consequent loss of // the most compact and productive part of the population . " Unhappy country , which a blind passion , and still more an overweening pride , has plunged into the gulf of crime and misery ! Poor excommunicated nation , - its principles accursed , its flag suspected , its contact shunned , its constantly recurring humiliations hardly compensated by some scanty profits , - the heart bleeds at the clear , certain , inevitable future that awaits such a number of men , who are , it should seem , not so much guilty as demented . With nothing in common with the rest of the world , with a police system along their frontier to resist the fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can have with them either political or moral or religious sympathy ? " ( p. 246 . ) This picture of the wretched coil in which the rebel States have wound themselves is graphic , and in the main undoubtedly true , though the author lays , very naturally , more stress on the weight and power of foreign opinion than has been justified by the subsequent events . The " maledictions of the universe " have not yet descended on the Southern cause , and will not descend until that cause becomes hopeless . The Southern " Cabinet " has not yet begun to tremble at the hostility , though they may have been bitterly disappointed by the continued neutrality , of the European powers . Unhappily the conscience of M. de Gasparin is not yet the conscience of England , or even of France . At the middle of March , while we were yet resolutely closing our eyes to the prospect of war , our author could say : " Let us not deceive ourselves ; the chances of civil war have been increasing for several weeks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckons the relative positions and advantages of North and South very differently from Mr. Spence , whose views we have given above , ( and who had , moreover , the observation of six months of actual war to guide him , ) but does not endeavor to predict the issue of so terrible a conflict . He is nevertheless convinced that , even should the Soathern States succeed in establishing their independence , they will fail of the consolation of having ruined the United States , which must still keep their rank among the nations , with all the old traditions and all the actual power ,  --  " of one // mind , masters of themselves , knowing their own needs , and putting to the service of a noble cause a constantly increasing power . " But in the face of such a contrast in all the elements of national strength , the author does not believe in the permanent separation of the Union ; and , besides , he believes that the reciprocal interest of the North and South in each other would of itself operate eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , each portion stands in need of the other portion , - agricultural , manufacturing , commercial , they form together one of the most homogeneous countries that I know . I can not believe that such a country is destined to be permanently divided , and that too in an age when the tendency is rather toward the union of small nations than toward the severance of great ones . " ( p. 253 . ) A chapter follows on the coexistence of the white and black races after emancipation . Its views are intelligent and humane ; but yet it seems to us that the most philosophic discussion of such a subject fails inevitably of any practical result , and that so many conditions will enter into the solution of that vast problem , which are at present utterly unforeseen , and must remain so until the question comes up for settlement , that we may as well pass the whole subject over at once into the list of problems whose only solution is empirical , and trust , with M. de Gasparin , that , if there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master the question of emancipcttion itself , there will also be enough to solve the supplementary question of the coexistence of the races in freedom . The book closes with a noble chapter on the regenerating influence which the present crisis must needs work on our political institutions and national character . The nation has come under another influence . That of the South was evil , and in the long period of its continuance had compromised everything . That of the North now begins , which is to elevate and save both institutions and character . Gasparin confesses he has no partiality for the republican form of government , - he prefers the English constitution ; but he is careful not to put form above substance . Moreover , he thinks he sees , with De Tocqueville , that France , spite of her present absolutism , tends toward democracy ; and he says that , in // view of such a possibility , it becomes intelligent Frenchmen to examine and understand the working of democratic institutions in America , and not to encourage a contempt for Americans because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its violence , its levelling propensities , and the like - are on the surface , and must gradually disappear . The loss of individuality in the mass , the absorption of private conscience by the state , the tyranny of the majority , - these are graver evils , and the probability of safely avoiding them has increased immensely with the movement by which the nation has cast off its old subserviency to the Southern power . This chapter is worthy of De Tocqueville , and is nearly or quite free from the enthusiasm of the earlier portions . With two more extracts we must take our leave of this most interesting book . The first is a serious warning to England against forsaking her ancient ground as the champion and advocate of Freedom against Slavery - " Let England take heed ! She had better lose Malta , Corfu , and Gibraltar than abandon the glorious position which her long struggle against slavery and the slave-trade has gained for her in the esteem of the nations . Even in this , the day of iron-clad frigates and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank God , the moral force . Woe to that nation which consents to let go that force , and to sacrifice its principles to its interests . From the beginning , the enemies of England , and they are many , have prophesied that the cause of Cotton would be heavier in her balance than the cause of Justice and Liberty . The world prepares to judge her by her conduct in the American crisis . Once more , let her take heed ! - p. 392 . The other extract is one in which we are assured of the sympathy and good-will of France - " It is from a distance that we express our sympathy , but it concerns events of which one judges better perhaps from a distance than close at hand . Europe is well placed for appreciating the actual crisis . The opinion of France in particular should have some weight in the United States . Independently of our old alliance , we are perhaps the nation most interested in the success of the Union . There are friendly voices which here and there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our good wishes . In wishing the final triumph of the North , we are hoping for the welfare of North and South , - for their common grandeur and lasting prosperity . " - p. 408. // If we are right in accepting such books as those of Mr. Spence and M. de Gasparin as in some degree representative of the feeling and mode of thought adopted , whether consciously or unconsciously , in their respective countries , we have only another instance ( more pronounced and decided than those which have preceded it , in proportion to the unequalled magnitude of the occasion ) of the singular variance which has always existed between the French and English views in regard to the United States . We are not speaking now of friendliness and aversion , of cordiality and coldness , of interest and indifference ,  --  though just now , unfortunately , we do not lack for evidence that our late growing cordiality with Great Britain has been more sentimental than solid . But those Englishmen who have visited this country with the view of book-making ( and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all consideration of institutions with a hopeless chapter or two , to seize upon the trivial peculiarities of speech , of dress , of personal and daily habit ; and have been contented if , on reaching home , they could send to the press their descriptions , brilliant or stupid as the case might be , of these crudities , and their prediction of certain and deserved ruin to the institutions which could produce them . Here let us say that we trust and believe that we have no undue sensitiveness in regard to the comments and criticisms of foreign writers on these topics . Toward Mrs. Trollope , Captain Hall , Mr. Dickens , Mr. Colley Grattan , and the rest of the numerous company of more or less intelligent critics , we have never felt the least tinge of that bitterness which was so generally excited by their books . We are perfectly assured that even the strictures of Mrs. Trollope did us unmixed good as a people , and had a much greater effect than was ever conceded to them in mitigating certain of the more startling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was most outraged by their publication . And we should be sorry to deny , what it is nevertheless painful to confess , that the " American Notes " of Mr. Dickens , though filled with the most laughable , and doubt* less intentional exaggerations , and in the main with no more pretension to the character of an authentic narrative than the " Pickwick Papers , " did nevertheless contain some perfectly se // rious criticism on the tone of society and the conduct of affairs , in some most important particulars , which no true American could ever read without acknowledging with shame and sorrow their disgraceful truth . Such was that chapter toward the close of the book , on the character of the newspaper press of the United States ,  --  a chapter which , we regret to say , is very nearly as true to-day as it was twenty years ago . We believe that the criticism of strangers , if intelligent and honest , is wholly beneficial , and more so than the same criticism from native writers . And yet is is impossible not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though keen enough in detecting the trivialities of which we have spoken , have been utterly blind to the stronger peculiarities of constitution and laws , and to the principles which make their foundation ; while so prolonged and constant a residence at the centre of affairs as that of the " Times Correspondent , " an unusually practised and intelligent observer , seems to have qualified him only for the most complete misapprehension of the present , and the most stupid prophecies of the future . Such a uniform failure in apprehending the worth and the effects of our institutions can not without absurdity be attributed to incompetency in a nation which has produced such writers as Beiitham and Adam Smith in the past , and as Buckle and Mill in the present , - the rather as those institutions rest on the same ground of constitutional liberty and representation with their own ; - and , debarred from so easy a conclusion , we can not be far wrong in believing that it may be due , partly at least , to a certain jealousy ( stoutly denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth in wealth and consideration which has resulted from those institutions , and to an uneasy consciousness that much in their own forms might profit by a revision and comparison which the pride of Englishmen will not yet allow them to undertake . Thus the very likeness arid relation between the two nations has operated as a bar to intimate sympathy , and to candid and intelligent criticism . But with France the case has been widely different . From the days of Lafayette down through those of De Tocqueville to the present , the French mind , always more subtile and philosophic than the English , has seemed to delight in recognizing // with a certain surprise and curiosity the peculiarities of the young republic which began , continued , and is likely to end , in utter repudiation of every maxim of French policy , and every canon of French taste . There has never been much French travel in the United States , nor any intimate literary relations between the two countries ; - our boisterous politics must have disgusted Frenchmen at least as much as Englishmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; - our offences against good taste in the conduct of domestic affairs can not have been less conspicuous to the most polite people in Europe , than to that which is perhaps the least polite ; - and yet we find such men as De Tocqueville , Brissot de Warville , Michel Chevalier , Laboulaye , and IDe Gasparin inquiring with the liveliest interest into the working of our political system , and into the public and private manners of our people , and discussing , not always favorably we admit , but rarely with serious misapprehension , and never with bitterness , questions which the English writers have passed by in contemptuous silence , or have made the subjects for sneers and abuse . Remembering these facts , we shall not be surprised that the same contrast which established itself in the days of the Revolution , and has existed more or less visibly ever since , reappears to-day , in stronger colors than ever , in the dignity and patience with which the French nation has awaited the event of the present . struggle , and the bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same trial . From the strange and stern experiences of the time , this government and people will have learned , among other lessons of greater or less importance , two which they will not be likely soon to forget ; - first , that no people , however perfect in the -- ory its institutions , or however favorable may seem the conditions under which its political and social life moves on , is ever so safe from internal disturbance and revolt as to be justified . in neglecting the means of enforcing , on the largest scale , its legitimate authority ; and secondly , that , when such disturb -- ance comes , the nation affected can never look for any honest . expression of sympathy or support from foreign governments beyond what is prompted by their clearest interests . In our long period of unbroken prosperity , we had so perseveringly von . xciV. - NO. 195. 37 // put far from us all recognition of the possibility of such a thing as actual rebellion under a popular government administered like our own , as to have quite lost sight of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every community a stronger motive for political action than any regard for plighted faith , or for the rights of majorities , - a fact quite sufficient to account both for the rebellion at home , and for the support it receives abroad . It was because we had lost sight of this great fact , that , during those dreary months when the South was getting ready for the conflict , the people of the loyal States looked on at those ominous preparations more in wonder and incredulity than in apprehension , - and at the wickedness of the conniving government at Washington with the charity of a community utterly blind to its most obvious results . It was because we had lost sight of this great fact , that , after the struggle had fairly begun , after the breathless and agonizing apprehension with which the people followed the rush of the three-months ' men to the capital , - when its safety was at length assured , and the nation with a sigh of relief put by its first hot enthusiasm and settled to its work , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - we then looked across the water for the expected words of good cheer from " the mother country , " and were smitten with a keen disappointment when , after a most unpromising silence , we found , first , the proclamation of neutrality , next , an illconcealed popular sympathy with the South , and then misrepresentation of the character and aims of the North , developing rapidly into open and avowed advocacy of the rebel cause , coupled with the most malignant and brutal abuse of the government and the people of the loyal States . If on the Continent , where governments and people are seldom on so good terms with each other as in England , we saw now and then some evidence of a popular sympathy with the national cause , we were not long in discovering that the courts and ministers of Europe were not likely to look with much disfavor on the expected humiliation of a rival power whose traditions were those of popular liberty ; and , with the exception of the cordial note of the Russian Minister , every incident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The disappointment was bitter , but wholesome . We have cared too anxiously for the opinion of foreign nations , and have often claimed their admiration on grounds wholly unworthy the enthusiasm or the pride of a great people . If now where we looked for friendship we find only indifference , and where we looked for neutrality we find secret or avowed antagonism , it may save us from the complications which might well arise from foreign alliances , and keep our eyes and thoughts turned steadfastly to the great work and its clear and unmistakable issue . Then we shall prove to foreign nations , what we began by telling them , that our motive is not ambition , nor love of power , but a deep sense of responsibility to the cause of the people and of self-government throughout the world . When this shall have been proved by great deeds and generous sacrifices , and the sublime work of restoration and of pacification shall have been accomplished , - then , as the nation moves forward once more in the majesty of a new life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proud satisfaction , that we shall look back , and remember that we have fought our way through the darkness alone , and have come forth into the light , invincible , and ready to meet friendship or enmity with equal serenity.
