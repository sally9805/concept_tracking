Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : Scenes . from Poems , in The Southern Amaranth ( 1869 ) Oh , God ! if gifted with an angel 's flight , And somewhat of an angel 's mystic sight , ' T were ours to pass this bleeding country over What visions would those piercing orbs discover ! What horrors branded on the shrinking brain Would burn and burn like purgatorial pain , Thrilling throughout our consciousness to rise In nightmare terror on our sleeping eyes ! Nay ! though our flight be fancy 's  --  and our view But owns the magic of an insight true , We well may pause and tremble as we see Revived , in all their shame and infamy , The cruel orgies of that later day Of Rome , which knew the Borgia 's cruel sway Ere Rome sunk to perdition  --  ! But with these Are mingled tenderer scenes and images , Mournful as any Shakspeare pitying wrought On the dim canvas of pathetic thought . Farewells , whereat no scorching tears are shed , Mute claspings of the brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart be broke And the soul withered at the lightning 's stroke Of supreme grief ! unconscious children playing Despite a father 's curse , a mother 's praying ; Fair maidens , smiling on despair , to make A lover 's death-bed softer for love 's sake , And all home 's fragrant ministries that bring Full blosoms and odors ( like a sudden spring Born in mid winter ) to the sufferer 's room , Wafting both light and sweetness through the gloom Yet o'er it all , fierce tumult and false calm , Unseen , but sovereign , rules the dread " I Am ! " His prescience guides the complex threads of Fate , His mercy will not leave us desolate , For in our blood , our tears , and pain and sorrow , Rest the rich germs of some sublime to-morrow !

Allston ! o'er whose illustrious way Two Muses shed their separate ray , Each struggling for the regal sway :  --  Painting and Poesy !  --  he won From both , ere yet his race was run , The plaudit of a deep " well done !

" Poet of Woodlands ! " men will see More clearly what they owned in Thee When thou , oh Bard ! hast ceased to be ! And Wilde ! his polished numbers glide Serenely ; on that roseate tide , A hundred charmed Fancies ride , Like golden shallops o'er a stream Of fairy-land ; how gently seem Affection 's moon-like rays to gleam Across his manly brow , who sung " My Father , " with a trembling tongue , And tears from heart-deep memories wrung ! And Pike ! whose Muse  --  a sylvan maid  --  Thro ' all the woodland haunts hath strayed , Fair Dian of the Western glade !

But lo ! our younger Minstrels rise , High-browed , with kindling mien and eyes , Bathed in the bliss of Earth and Skies ! Not dead to us , but fair as when He charmed the listening ears of men With music from his mountain glen ; Soft threnodies from soul and brain Pierced by an inward thorn of pain  --  Most touching in his " Florence Vane , " Cooke and his Poet-Brother pass , Musing amid the autumn grass , Of rich Virginia woods ; alas , That they  --  twin Minstrels , bold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those rare songs , mixed fire and dew !

Oh , golden lays ! no common lyre Outpours those strains of love or ire , All instinct with the sacred fire ! The " Call to Arms , " in thrilling tone , Rings like a silver trumpet blown , For Knights to guard their Sovereign 's Throne ! And " Carolina , " like a wail , First strikes the dubious spirit pale  --  Then , as a keen sword smiting mail Of proof , extorts an answer clear , ' T were well the sullen Foe should hear , With echoings of a stern " Beware !

Still must we make our music heard ; These genuine numbers , long deferred Full audience , shall not leave unstirred , In callous scorn , the hearts of those Who , pondering in a cold repose , Have watched our strife with ruffian foes ! The storm must break  --  the spring-time come ! No longer drowned by trump or drum , Truth 's voice shall waken Christendom ! Then , with the war-cloud rolled afar , And all undimmed our natal star , Mankind SHALL know us  --  AS WE ARE !  --  A people , liberal , noble , brave , And courteous to the feeblest slave , Trembling at fourscore o'er his grave !

Then Art will build her stately Fane , And Song resound from Height to Plain , Re-echoing to the Heights again ! Till , in the ripened time , shall rise , With deep , divinely-thoughtful eyes , And brow whereon the Destinies Placed even at birth , a shadowy crown , The Poet whose august renown Will smite the haughtiest natures down To homage !  --  from whose " golden mouth , " ( Fit well-spring for a World in drouth , ) Outspeaks the Shakspeare of the South !
