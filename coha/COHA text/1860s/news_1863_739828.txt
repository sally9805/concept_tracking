txt From the following special dispatch to the Missouri Democrat it will be seen that the recent rebel raid was likely to have been a formidable affair , had not Gen. BROWN so suddenly checked it : JEITERBON CITY , Sunday evening , Oct . IL 1863 . A refugee by the name of Dr. Fasase , of Ilumansvine , Polk County , informs me that the rebels , 1,600 strong , under COFFEE or SHELBY , took Greenfield on Monday withoct opposition . The residents are fleeing for their lives . The rebels burned the Courthouse , and marched on Stockton. where were a company of Rangers under Capts , WALKER and SIMMONS , who retreated . Ile ( the Doctor ) dues not know what damage was done . On Wednesday at ' b A. M. , they attacked Humansville in large force . Fe.sasui. and all the male citizens retreated , as well as twenty of Capt . SuTLIERIAND 's company , in ALLEN 'S regiment , leaving the women anti children to the rebels . From the border of the town he saw smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees retreated to Warsaw and gave the alarm . Company E , Seventh M. S. AL , formed , and the rebels attacked them on Thursday morning . FRAzER heard the fight , and saw two Lieutenants one mile out , running front the town , who said all the company were killed or captured . Ile feels sure that Ilumansville is burned . Great excitement prevails all through Polk , Benton and Dade Counties . This is his statement , based partly on rumors , and must he received with caution . From reliable sources here I learn that the Greenfield Court-house was burned . The rebels burned Lamine bridge and water station , and it is reported that the guard , about 12 in number , were captured , the rebels changing clothes with them , after which they were paroled . They also captured Otter vine . on the railroad , out did not do ally damage to the town or property . The revels , when last heard from , were in force four miles north of Tipton . Citizens here are excited and formed into home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fourth M. S. M. cavalry , An engine , with three teen , Pear Tipton , was attacked on Friday by eighty rebels . The men fired , alai killed one rebel , and ran the engine off the trace . Col. COLE is in cormnand of the forces sent from the East . Gen. Times is in command About three hundred feet of track destroyed east of Tipton w as replaced today , The special correspondent of the same paper says : JEFERSON CITY , Monday Morning , The invasion of the State by an armed force of rebels , variously estimated at from 1,600 to 5,000 , has created the most intense alarm all through the southern counties , aid ? the inhabitants are seeking refuge in flight . There appears to be no thought among the people of resistance , as they possess the idea that the military force of the State , under preetit management , is inadequate to insure life and property , and for the residents of any single town to attempt to cope with the enemy sieele-handed , and poorly armed as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to He all mounted , well clothed and armed , and capable of performing long marches by the ail of their superior horse-flesh. ? * The refugees are loud in their denunciations of the State Government , in not checking the invasion at the first , before the rebels could exchange their wornout animals for fresh ones , and gather to their standard the numerous squads of prowling plunderers who infest the counties on the border of Arkansas . Of the destruction of the Court-house at Greenfield on Monday there can be no doubt , but as tar as my information extends no further damage was done the town . This is to be accounted for by the circumstance that these raiders were aiming at Sedalia , where there is valuable plunder , and they did not wish to delay their arrival there or impede their progress by the transportation of artioles of little or no value . Warsaw was attacked at sunrise on the morning of Thursday . At that post Company E , of the Seventh M. S. M. , ( Puere 's regiment , ) vv as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dr. FRAZER and other Polk County refugees , of the approach of the rebels , and to his credit be it said , instead of deserting his post ( I guess he must be a Radical ) he resolved to give them a warm reception , should the force not prove too large . On the alarm being given , skirmishing commenced between the advance guard of SHELBY and the pickets of Company E. The pickets were soon driven in , and the enemy advanced in two columns , it is said , in heavy force . This was the signal for the retreat of the refugees , who left the militia to hold them in check while they saved themselves in flight . But arriving beyond the range of bullets on the outskirts of the town a halt was made by the refugees , from which point they distinctly heard the clack of rifles and the clashing of swords . * * w Arriving at Cole Camp , the enemy , no doubt , learned of the large force under Gen. BROWN near Sedalia and Clinton , and deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they turned east and struck the railroad above Tipton on Friday . They proceeded through Otterville , doing little or no damage , arrived at the Lamede Bridge , took the guard of ten or twelve men prisoners , broke their arms , made them exchange clothes , and paroled therm . One soldier sayste exchanged clothes several times . At this point they were in force , They had small squads out to the right and left during their entire journey , but on striking the Pacific Railroad they called them in , and proceeded east along the road , with scouts out in every direction . They burned the water station this sloe of Lamede Bridge , and pushed on toward Tipton , burning about three hundred yards of the track east of teat town . Before this , on their approach to the town . the telegraph operator , Mr , WOODRUM , packed up his papers and retreated east . Subsequently the operator , in company with Mr. Mclitssoce , Superintendent , Capt . Tner.ev and an engineer , proceeded up the road upon an engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was burned , they came suddenly upon a company of rebels drawn up in line near the track .
