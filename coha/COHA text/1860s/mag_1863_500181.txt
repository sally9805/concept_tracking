A TRIP TO ANTIETAM . TUE great battle of the Antictam had been fought , and a veteran army was gathered nround Harper 's Ferry recruiting for fresh campaigns . Here was a chance to see a battle field and warriors to be celebrated for all time . From childhood up we have been taught history ; and all history , except some few dry constitutional treatises , has been accounts of great commanders , of the marches and retreats of bronzed soldiers , of empires won by the sword , of dynasties established by con uests . Our hymn book , our clergymen , and our Bible have exhorted us to be soldiers of the cross , to buckle on our armor and to fight the . good fight , even when taming the other check when smitten on the one . Now thfs opportunity to see actual history , a battle field , and veteran troops , and great leaders whose names are to be household words , could not be resisted ; so , taking a couple of blankets apiece , and a few clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started by rail for Baltimore , and thence for the army . Around Baltimore were several regiments . Those that we visited were of the recent levies , and were improving fast in discipline and drill . They were placed in strong positions to prevent a rebel attack from the west , and to coininand the city . The stars and stripes floated over houses in all parts of the town . We met a little company of boys seven miles out playing soldier , with the star-spangled banner , a cheering sign of the loyalty of the place . At Baltimore my friend and I took seats in the car for Harper 's Ferry . The train was crowded with a most miscellaneous set of passengers , officers of all grades , from general with stars to second lieutenant with plain bands , common soldiers , sutlers , Jews , and country people . Some of the Jews , after a voL. ni. - lO time , became the most noisy part of the crowd , and belied their proverbial reputation for shrewdness by imbibing from bottles , which they circulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . The most interesting companion we met was a member of the Maryland House of Representatives , a very sensible man , and of course a strong Unionist . He did not approve of the President 's emancipation proclamation ; thought it would alienate Union men in the Border States , and made other objections to it . He informed us that his negroes were of no profit to him ; that the proclamation had made them believe they would all be free ; that they did pretty much what they chose ; and that Maryland would have to accede to the President 's advice to the Union Border States to emancipate their slaves and receive compensation for so doing . The railroad , after leaving the Relay House , runs along the Patapseo river , amid most beautiful scenery . We passed numerous trains with Government stores-one of bag* , age cars fitted up with rough seats and crowded inside and on the top with a regiment of Uncle Sam 's bluecoats , cheering and singing as new troops only do . There were no signs of the devastations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their campaign in Maryland , the rebels at one time made this river their line of defence : it was supposed that they would make here a stand against McClellan 's advance from Wshington . They had burnt the woodwork of the bridge , twisted the long iron rods of the structure to one side , destroyed all the railroad building , engines , and cars they could lay hands on , and bad done everything to retard our force . A new bridge had now been recently built , over which we were obliged to pass // slowly . Immediately after leaving the rivei* , the road branched , one track leading to Frederick , then an immense hospital containing seven thousand wounded soldiers , the other keeping on and striking the Potomac at the Point of Rocks . We saw soldiers and sentries at several places , but were surprised that we did not see more . The road keeps close to the river for some miles to Harper 's Ferry . On the other side the ground was frequently occupied by the enemy 's pickets ; the difficulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelling of trains on our side . Thc Potomac was unusually low ; thcrc had been a long season of dry , beautiful weathcr , rendering it fordablc in many places . At the Point of Rocks we enter upon the mountains of the Blue Ridge , and the railroad winds in the deep valley worn by the river , amid the most picturesque and beautiful scenery . The canal is between the railroad and river : its locks had been destroyed and the water drained out by the rebel hordes ; for it is a great artery of life to Washington , and invaluable to an army encamped along its borders , furnishing economically the transportation of the great supplies necessary for the soldiers ' subsistence . At this time it seemed of no use except *s a depository for the carcasses of dead horses . With the exception of this dismal empty canal , there were very few signs of the ravages of the armies which had lately swept through these charming valleys . A few miles from Harper 's Ferry , by the side of the railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overflowing . As we approached Sandy Hook , a village of a few houses on the north side of the Potomac , about a mile from Harper 's Ferry , w* saw on the road , which ran close to the railroad track , thousands of the bluebodied , white-topped army wagons . In the most crowded thoroughfare of London one would not see so many teams . From this neighborhood the great army of the Potomac drew the most of its supplies . The ninth army corps was moving this day to its camp , two or three miles northward ; and part of its cannon , their brazen throats still tarnished by sulphurous smoke , added to the throng . It is surprising how large a portion of the army is composed of these baggage trains , and of the camp followers , teamsters , servants , and sutlers . A regiment of infantry , under the little shelter tents is crowded , into a small space ; but the bulky baggage trains cover much ground . We spent the best part of a day , in going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small wayside tavern in this little village of Sandy Hook , with no other amusement than watching the moving of the teamsters , chatting with stray officers and soldiers , and seeing what may be called the back-stair life of the army . And we wish here to protest against the abuse which has been so abundantly heaped upon the teamsters : we found them , as a class , a respectable body of men , quite skilful in the management of their animals , comparing well with those in the same occupation in our great cities : there was certainly not so much swearing , and not so much abuse of their mules and horses , as one sees in New York . I remember their kind attention to me , some days afterward , when , in my impatience to get by a long train of teams filling up a little country road , I had imprudently urged my horse on to a ledge of rocks , where he , not being an old warhorse , hesitated , slipped , and fell fiat on his side , among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the horse , with my leg under him , was rolling to recover himself , the anxiety of the teamsters as to whether I was hurt , and then as to my horse , a fine animal , who had out himself a little on the rocks . Their proffered assistance was very different from the oaths I should have met under similar circumstances in some Northern cities . The army wagons are large , with // great white cotton coverings , and generally drawn by six mules : the driver , usually a colored man , rides the first nigh mule , and has one rein , called the jerky rein , ' running over the head of the mule before him , through a ring fastened to his headstall , and dividing on the back of the leader , and fastening to his bit . The mule is directed to one side or another by the driver twitching the rein and shouting . There were some few wagons driven from the box , but in all these cases that we noticed , the animals were horses , four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mules and horses were generally in good condition , and quite a contrast to those in the cavah-y service , which , even in a crack regiment , like the sixth regular , presented a most sorry appearance of overwork and terribly hard usage . The baggage trains and camp followers are a necessary portion of every army , and its efficiency depends in a great measure upon the perfect organization of this essential part . In the French army this organization is carried to a high degree of perfection . A small army of ten or twenty thousand men can get along with a fewer proportional number of followers , as it lives more upon the country , than a great army of one hundred thousand . Every regiment has its own baggage wagons to carry its tents , cooking apparatus , officers ' mess chests , and personal baggage . At the beginning of the war , each of the Massachusetts regiments was fitted out with from fifteen to twenty-four wagons . A recent United States regulation has limited the number to six for one regiment . The personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the great transportation of an army . The spare ammunition is no small matter ; every cannon having a supply of round shot , shell , canister , and grape : all these may be needed by each piece in a battle , as the shot used depends upon the distance of the foe . A full regiment of infantry may fire in one battle sixty thousand rounds of ammunition , weighing nearly three tons . The pontoon trains , the baggage of the staff the forage for the horses of the artillery and of the generals , field officers , and their staffs , the food of the army , and the food and forage for this further army of camp followers-all have to be transported . The cavalry are expected to forage for their horses from off the country ; all the rest have to be provided for . To carry the subsistence of a regiment of nine hundred men for one day , requires one of the six-mule teams : for a march of twenty days there must be twenty wagons . One will see from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the great post of responsibility . Tie has to see that all the supplies are obtained and forwarded to the right place . He commands all these countless wagons with their teamsters . It is also his duty , when on the march , to pick out the camp , unless the general may take it from out of his hands . The army , as a general thing , will not fight well unless it is well fed and well cared for . To assist him , the quartermaster has his necessary clerks , for he carries on a large business , with Uncle Sam as his principal , and he must account to him for every pound of coffee , bacon , flour , and hay , barrel of vinegar , keg of nails , tent or tent pin that he receives , and finally return them , or tell him satisfactorily where they have gone , and produce his vouchers ; or he and his bondsmen must pay their value . All this is done by system and rule : there are mounted wagonmasters to look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of discipline prevails among these non-enlisted men . A great army must be a moving city , capable of subsisting itself in the uncultivated and desert regions through which it often passes . Every cavalry soldier carries his spare horseshoes and nails ; and every cavalry regiment and every battery of artillery has its own forge , tools , and materials for shoeing its horses and // making repairs : even the quartermaster 's train must have its blacksmiths and their supplies . In travelling down the Rhone during the Crimean war , I was vainly trying to make out the meaning of the letters on the military button of an officer sitting before me ; when one of his companions , who happened to be at my side , a well-educated , intelligent man , good-naturedly informed me that they indicated that the wearer belonged to the bureau of the post . He and several others on the boat had been educated for this branch of the service at a military school in Paris , and were en route for the sole purpose of taking charge of this department . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , in many respects , is an army of volunteers ; but still a messenger had to go every day to Washington for the letters of the army corps , and the telegraph and its wires travel with the camp . The officers ' servants alone , in an armyofa hundred and fifty thousand men , number more than the thirty-nine hundred soldiers the city of Boston has to raise for her proportion of the levy of ninemonths men . The number of servants and horses of an officer depends upon his rank ; he draws subsistence for the number allowed to him . A mere cavalry captain can draw for and usually has two horses . His horses and trappings , his mess , must be cared for by others ; and hence the thousands of servants that must go with the thousands of officers . But let us pass from this , which is common to every army , and proceed on our journey . The easily pulverized , light , claycy soil around Sandy Hook was raised in huge clouds by the countless wagons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , couriers , and wagonmasters . The little tavern was once , the old woman who ke1 t it assured us , surrounded by a pretty fence and a garden with grass and flowers : now the fence was half gone , and to its pickets were tied the horses of officers , quartermasters , baggagemasters , a orderlies , and the flowers were trampled into light dust . The provisions in the house had been eaten by hungry travellers , who were supplied with very scanty fare , and were thankful to get that . The old woman , having dealt out to us the little she had left , for which she demanded most abundant compensation , amused us with her tales . Her house had been alternately the home of Unionists and rebels . It was not many days since divisions of rebels had gone by and encamped there , both before and after the surrender of Harper 's Ferry . The shells fired in that fight had passed over her tavern . Her description of the hungry , tired troopers , arriving in the evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under their horses ' bellies , horses and men packed in together as thick as a swarm of bees , was quite graphic . Her accounts of her conversations with the great rebel leaders were interesting , but I feared were apocryphal , as she ended by assuring us that General Lee had to sleep supperless on her woodpile . If it were not for this last tale , kind reader , you would have been entertained with the conversations of the great chiefs of rebeldom , as related by a reliable witness . We did hear from her , and from officers who saw the rebel soldiers at Harper 's Ferry , of the pitiable condition of some of the infantry , of their naked , bleeding feet , and their gaunt looks . Our landlady affirmed that we could not find a dog in the neighborhood ; for they had gone before the rebel hordes in the way that such flesh disappears before the Chinese and Pacific Islanders . It is probably true that at times they were hard pressed for food , and many badly off for shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead at Antietam that , though not so well shod as our men , they were shod , and they had provisions in their haversacks . The rebels have flour dealt out to them as rations on the march , and // they have to cook it . Our troops have hard biscuit , called tack ; ' it is made in squares , and some which was fresh was very good ; but it often comes to the regiments with maggots . This is not so much objected to ; but when , in addition , it is mouldy , the men grumble . By the side of the fresh tack were some Sandy Hook veteran biscuit , that had been through the Peninsular campaign , and had come last from Harrison 's Landing ; the outside of the boxes was enough to condemn them , and the commissary was saying that he must get Uncle Sam 's inspector-general to examine and pass upon them . When we saw this hard , mouldy old tack , we appreciated the joke of the Western boys , who declared they found the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B .. C. , ' Before Christ . ' The luxury of soft bread is prized by the troops . Near Baltimore , where the 38th Massachusetts were stationed for some weeks , nice ovens were built , after the fashion of the French army , and fresh bread , meats , and the Yankee Sunday beans cooked . With the army in the field this can not be done , but the ovens could have been built during the weeks our soldiers were resting on the banks of the Potomac . Our troops at this time were fed on the hard tack and fresh beef ; and some of the men in a camp near Sharpsburg complained of the want of salt provisions . This seemed unreasonable , until we heard that they had no salt , the long distance it had to be teamed being the excuse given for the unpardonable want of it . This hard tack is doing one good thing : it is giving the men white teeth ; you can tell an old soldier by his polished ivory ; his teeth approach the appearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bread . Reader , did you ever try to work your way through the hard loaf of the peasant 's fare ? The army regulations require tooth brushes for the men ; it is supposed that the proper use keeps off ague and disease ; still many regiments were without one to a company . But to return to our old woman at the little tavern of Sandy Hook . She had tales , too , of our officers . That morning she had seen our handsomest and our most splendid-looking general - in appearance the ideal of the brigand of the romance-Burnside , riding by , with his black , tall , army felt hat , without plume or gilt eagle , brim turned down , his dark blue blouse covered with dust . Why , ' said she , he looked , in his dusty blue shirt , with two old tin dippers strung by the handle at his belt , like any farmer ; but I suppose he had some better clothes . ' Her lament for the gallant fellows who had fallen by disease , torn by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the sufferings of the poor , sick , lame , and mutilated soldiers ; and her solemn asseverations that there was something wrong in the hearts of the leaders on both sides , to permit this suffering and loss of so many good men , was truly touching . We could not reason it out with her ; logic had to give place to her pathetic lamentation . I do not , however , intend to keep my readers so long a time at this little wayside inn as I was ; and will pass on to Harper 's Ferry , a mile beyond . But before we part , we certainly should not fail to notice a modern addition to the camp follower that Napoleon did not have in his grand armies  --  the newsboy  --  the omnipresent , the irrepressible gamin of the press . New ' York , Philadelphia , Baltimore , . Washington , all had contributed their quota , and what a glorious harvest they were reaping I Baltimore Americans , at five cents each ; New York Heralds , Ti'ilI ? enes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold early . One little fellow was strutting around with a pair of spurs on , and styled himself colonel ; ' the others he introduced as his staff . The day 's work was over , and larking had begun . I found the spurs were for use . The colonel had bought an old // condemned brute , which his companions were trying to buy at the advanced price of ten dollars . The camps were at a distance , from two miles upward , and a mounted boy could bring his wares to market first . And so the whole afternoon every rider of a particularly bad horse was pestered by an offer of five or ten dollars , from a throng of dirty , noisy , scampish ragamuffins . Later in the evening , the guard went by with some three or four of the boys , for once without a grin on their faces , under arrest . We asked the colonel , who had the reputation of being an honest fellow , what was the matter with his suite . He only replied that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way things were going ; and walked off , clanking his long spurs over the stones . The railroad and road from Sandy Hook to Harper 's Ferry run under the Maryland Heights , the rocks having been blasted away for a passage . The railroad bridge had been rebuilt , not permanently , but so that trains could again cross . Lower down the river were the remains of the pontoon bridge destroyed by the rebels . Higher up on the other side of the railroad was a new pontoon bridge , built on boats , painted with Uncle Sam 's light blue color . Farther up , the wagons were fording the stream . As you crossed the pontoon bridge , you came directly to the little stone engine house , with its belfry , where John Brown held the power of the great State of Virginia at bay . All else of the Government buildings are in ruins . The long lines of brick and stone walls blackened by fire , and the picturesque broken arches of the engine-house windows , were a fit greeting to one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Through the clouds of dust and the noise and confusion of the village upon the hill rising immediately above the river , we rode , noting the signs of the recent contest , or looking down on the blue Potomac , flowing peacefully below . One large brick house had a breach in the basement story large enough for us to ride in , caused by some bursting shell . Dead horses still lay in the road ; the tailpiece of a broken cannon was yet there . As we emerged out of the dust at the top of the hill beyond , toward the afternoon sun , rose Bolivar Heights , and the innumerable white tents of General Sumner ' s large army corps . The soldiers were out for drill or dress parade . The distant sounds of the bands and bugles and drums , sometimes succeeding each other , then mingling together , fell softened but constantly on the ear , and everywhere was the gleam of the declining sun on glistening sword or bright musket barrel . Behind us to the east , and beyond the Shenandoah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose the high London Mountains ; on the north , on the other side of the Potomac , were the Maryland Heights , with the road to Sharpsburgh and Williamsport winding along* its wooded base . The tops of these mountains were lighted up and wreathed with the smoke of the fires kindled to destroy the thick woods that might afford shelter to approaching enemies . It was most charming mountain scenery . We enjoyed the view long , but had to turn our backs at last ; itnd as we recrossed the pontoon bridge we wiped off from the soles of our feet a large portion of the sacred soil of Vi*rginia . Yes , the sacred soil of Virginia , the mother of presidents , the home of Washington , Patrick Henry , Jefferson , and Madison , and of how many others famous in our history . O Virginia , what a contrast is there now ! the blood of thy boasted chivalry struggling manfully stains the ground ; thy soil is ground to powder under the heel of the hated mudsils of the North ; thy fertile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the fierce contest , and desolation and want have come to every household ; and the cry arises for thy sons that are not ! The headquarters of Gen. MeClel // lan were two or three miles north of Knoxville , a little village on the Potomac , about three miles below Harper 's Ferry . The day that we were there , the General was absent on his way to meet Mrs. McClellan , and though the telegraph wires ran to headquarters , nothing was there known of the foray Stuart had begun early that morning from Hancock , in the rear of our forces ; not till evening , and until his arrival at Chambersburg did the news arrive . If the telegraph wires had been laid , or the signal corps so stationed as to have given warning of the inception of this movement , these bold rebels could not have advanced so far , but would have been compelled to retreat as they came . Between the General 's headquarters and the river were the famous sixth cavalry of regulars and some batteries of artillery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the northeast , where Stuart 's cavalry passed on their way to the Potomac . The camp itselI* was not well placed , and was soon changed . In going from it we rode through a most beautiful country by the side of an officer of the sixth cavalry , and listened to his enthusiastic account of scouting in front of our lines , in the footsteps of the retreating enemy , over the very roads we were travelling safely and without concern ; and yet we were not many miles from the foe , and within reach of the marvellous flight of the mini6 ball , which some lurking rifleman might aim from the other side of the Potomac . These cavalry soldiers and horses have had a terribly hard time of it . The horses of the sixth were more broken down and thinner than in the artillery or baggage trains . Two squadrons had lately been part of the force sent on a reconnoisance to Leesburg ; and upon the return of our troops it had been the duty of our companion , then in command , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some two hundred had fallen out of the ranks from mere exhaustion . To leave any of these soldiers behind would be giving them up as prisoners , and affording the enemy the opportunity of obtaining information which it was of the utmost importance for the safety of the expedition to keep back . The troopers had therefore to drive them on with their swords-not a pleasant duty , when the poor fellows were faint and used up by fatigue-still it must be done . This service creates quite a dislike between the two arms . The infantry man hates the horseman , and the cavalry man despises the foot soldier . At this time straggling was quite prevalent : we saw on byroads many who had left the ranks , almost invariably having thrown away their arms , and subsisting on plunder . The cavalry were scounug the roads for them , and were bringing them in as prisoners for punishment . This sixth cavalry , like all the old regiments which had been through the Peninsular campaign and the disastrous retreat under Pope , was frightfully reduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards out of the eleven hundred who first took the field . Many had fallen on picket or been cut off singly , more by disease , but alike doing their duty , unmentioned and unnoticed . A larger number were yet suffering from overwork and sickness ; and the regiment would in time recruit to seven hundred , from men now disabled , if there should be no more casualties . A few days in camp , in a good-sized tent-none of the two-feet-bigh shelter affairs-in pleasant summer weather , is , on the whole , something new and exhilarating . The ground , to be sure , is rather hard , particularly when you have no straw ; and a soldier 's table is not always the most luxurious in the world . Now that we are safe , dry , and warm , at home , we can venture to declare that we were very unfortunate in losing the sensation of going without food , of sleeping in the mud and in the rain-our arms girded on-any // moment to be aroused by the whistle of the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadly strife . To us ; however , it was all couleur de rose . In the early morn , at break of day , it was not the crow of the cock , or the jarring rattle of the wheels of the city baker or milkman , but the reveille that waked us from our martial dreams . The drum of the infantry , the bugles of the cavalry and artillery would begin ; some early riser would rouse up his regiment ; then another would take it up ; until the call had gone through every corps . The old staid rub-a-dub of the English drummer is giving place to the stirring French rat-a-plan . And there was one band that generally led off in a splendid style . They did beat their drums lively and sharply . Not being obliged to be up with the sun and cook our own breakfast , we generally contrived to get a little more sleep . After breakfast , the bands were playing for guardmounting ; and we sat gazing down into the valley from our tent upon the large army corps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blue Ridge , through whose gaps not many days before , a few miles farther north , Franklin had successfully fought he way . Still farther up , Burnside , with Reno and Hooker under him , had at South Munutain driven the enemy in-that battle which came to us so welcome , the first victory after Pope 's disasters , and the retreat from the Peninsula . The valley below us was Pleasant Valley . The opposite side to our tent was a short spur of the Blue Ridge ; the southern extremity of which is the Maryland Heights , so *ell known in the history of the surrender of Harper 's Ferry . The valley between is fertile and highly cultivated , full of mountain springs and brooks , emptying into one stream of sufficient size to turn the wheels of a lame mill ; the water is delicious ; the prevailing limestone does not reach this valley . In the morning before the army moved there , the little river was clear as crystal ; at night it was changed into an opaque white color , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleanliness of our men . There were no clothes lines , however , but many of the washers were so scantily off for clothing that they put their garments on to dry . The farmhouses in the valley are mostly of stone . It is a most charming and beautiful place , and , appropriately called Pleasant Valley . ' The farmers are prosperous ; and the land so rich that it sells for the high price of seventy and eighty dollars an acre . The mountains rising on the sides of the valley are thickly wooded ; and in the cultivated fields between were crowded the tents of the ninth army corps . With the exception of one or two new regiments who had wall tents , the soldiers were under little shelter tents , of which each man carries a piece . The infantry were encamped in divisions and brigades ; the cavalry generally picketed along a fence ; the horses and men , except the officers , without shelter . The encampments of the artillery and cavalry with their horses , forges , and wagons , covered much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was surprising to see how many men a small encampment would turn out . In the afternoon came drills , sometimes of regiments , sometimes of brigades , and the unfailing dress parade . There were a few regiments of new levies just arrived , a thousand strong ; all provided with overcoats , and looking finely in their new , cle n clothesquite a contrast to the old soldiers . In one of the old regiments on brigade drill we saw an officer , probably a sergeant , in a checked knit undervest , his neck and part of his arms bare-coinmanding a company . A sentry on guard before the quarters of the general in command , had great holes in both elbows of his dirty jacket , and his shoes were untied . The brigades were generally of five regiments , a new regiment being one , and composing fully // two fifths of the line . It is not wholly , however , by the casualties of the battle or the greater losses from exposure , overwork , and disease , that the regiments are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is detailed to the forge ; others are detached as ambi4-lance drivers , or as hospital attendants or clerks . This thins the ranks of the old regiments . It is surprising , however , to see how much better the veterans will bear exposure than men coming fresh from home . The old regiments - ere frightfully diminished by disease on the Peninsula ; but I saw very few that could not rally more men than the 35th Massachusetts , that had been out of the State only a little over a month . They had but three hundred men of the original thousand . They left Washington without their knapsacks ; and had marched without even the shelter tents , officers and , men alike bivouacking on the ground , wearing the same clothes without a change . " he long marches , the exposures , the excitement of battle , and the unaccustomed food had disabled four hundred men ; some of them undoubtedly never strong enough to have enlisted , and who should have been rejected by the examining surgeons . The old regiments , who had gradually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to thrive on the soldier 's fare , lost comparatively few in this way . The brigade drills and the manoeuvres in line were not so well executed as we expected . There was no practice in firing at a mark ; probably from a want of ammunition . From accounts of officers on the field of battle , it certainly is the case in our army that some of the fresh soldiers will fire in the air , and even close their eyes . The Hythe system , as now taught in the English army , and among the rifle clubs , makes excellent marksmen ; and the greater part of the instruction is without the use of powder . It is a pity it can not be more extensively introduced in our army . One does not expect to find the same training before the enemy as in the great French camps of instruction . It was my good fortune to visit the camp of a portion of the great Crimean army . The privates , besides their military drill , were exercised in running , leaping , fencing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I fob lowed a regiment of the chasseurs of Vincennes to their field of drill . For an hour or two they went through different maneuvres by the bugle , performing many of the movements at the double quick . Then came a rest as soon as that was ordered , the fine band of the regiment came forward and struck up a lively dance , to the tune of which several of the privates amused and refreshed themselves by waltzing round the field . Returning , however , to our picturesque camp in this charming valley . There was no more striking scene than when darkness came on and the thousand camp fires and lights in the tents were all in sight . The rail fences , bought by the thoughtful quartermaster , and paid for as an army supply , were used as fuel ; a truly considerate act , for a quartermaster can buy fuel for the army , but he can not pay damages done to property . This same ground , now covered by our troops , had been camped over by Lee 's army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying for them in the worthless Confederate scrip . Soon after dark , the bright lights of the signal corps appeared on the mountain north of the aryland Heights , and messages were sent to McClellan 's headquarters . Flags are used in the day , and at night lanterns . The si6nal officer has two lights ; they are held one above the other , the lower one being stationary ; moving the upper light to the right means number one ; moving the light to the left , number two ; moving first to the right and then to the left , number three ; by lowering the upper light in front of the under one , a fourth signal is given ; and so on . There are // about five numbers ; and by the different combinations of these five numbers , there is made a great number of signals , which can be read by the officers who have the key . The mode is much the same as that used by our mercantile marine with their signal flags . The signals are given very rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the messages . Evening is the time for talk around the camp fires ; and the conversation often turns upon our rebellious brethren . Among our regular officers you meet the classmates and old companions in arms of the rebels , and hear of little traits and peculiarities that only intimate acquaintances can relate . Civilians who had known General Lee at Washington , have spoken of him as very formal , and rather pompous in his manner , giving the impression that he was a man of more show and pretence than abilities . We learned here , however , that , in Texas , or California , where he was for a long time before he took his high position on Scott 's staff , he was famous for marching his men without the usual encumbrances of baggage , on the most severe expeditions against the Indians , in the snow and cold of the winter . Stonewall Jackson has always been famed for his peculiarities . When a young man , he was possessed with the idea that he was in danger of having his limbs paralyzed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , counting the strokes , and annoyed beyond measure by the interruptions of his companions breaking up his count . Our officers , both regular and volunteer , who have been in actual battle , have a great respect for the rebel leaders and soldiers ; they speak veryhighly of their drill , and believe that straggling exists to a less extent among them , in battle , than with us . From the rebel newspapers I should doubt whether this is the case . One tfiing we have not considered , which has given the rebels a great advantage in this contest . It is the large number of military colleges in the South ; not like our few private schools at the North , but well-endowed academies . In the summer of 1860 , immediately before the election of Lincoln , I visited the military academy at Lexington , Virginia . It was supported at the expense of the State , with two hundred and more pupils , coming from the different counties in proportion to their population . They were practised in the actual firing of cannon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about two hours , much of the time at the double quick . The principal was a graduate of West Point ; and he was assisted by a respectable board of instructors . A good civil and military education , after the mode of instruction at West Point , was afforded to the students . This institution had been in existence for years ; and one can readily appreciate the advantage that Virginia has in this war from the graduates of this school . Alabama and several other of the Southern States have similar colleges ; while we at the North have been obliged to educate all our volunteer officers by actual service . The morning Stuart with his cavalry left Chambersburg , we rode forth for the battle field of the Antietam . We noticed the disappearance of some of the camps of the infantry brigades . We knew of the patrolling of the cavalry along the road we were pursuing , and fouad the picket guards farther out , and passes and countersigus necessary where before we went unchallenged . We were several hours in getting to the battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large brick farmhouse , where the battle on the left began . The hospital flag was still flying over the building , though no patients had been there for a day or two . Twenty-seven died in that one farmhouse from wounds received in that bloody fight . On the night of the battle , cows , sheep , poultry , and fences disappeared before our cold and hungry troops . But since then , though the house was in the neighborhood // of several camps , the old lady and her daughters , who alone were at home , had been undisturbed , except bythe small pilferings of stragglers . The great battle has been so well described by the correspondents of the newspaper press , and by those who were over the field before we were , that I shall only mention a f3w incidents to which our attention was called . The principal contest was on the right , west of the Antietam river . Here Hooker with his army corps began the battle , and fought so long and spendidly . Both armies crowded their forces to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been with their belts on since three in the morning , brought up his large corps , drawn up in three columns , forty paces apart , to r&amp;nforce Hooker 's hard-pressed soldiers , who were retreating before the fresh and overwhelming re*inforcemcnts of the enemy . In less than an hour , the whole of Sumner 's corps was swept back , broken and entirely routed , and never appeared in the field again ; the column in the rear not being in position to fire a gun , but losing as many men as those in front . The manner in which General Sumner brought his troops into action has been severely criticized , even by officers of his own corps ; whether justly or not , it is difficult to decide . No commander was more confided in by his soldiers than Sumner . He has risen from the ranks , and been through all the grades of the service , ' He knows how to treat his men , ' were expressions constantly heard . General Hooker 's reputation as a fighting general was admitted everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as most excellent . It was also on the right that the desperate fighting in the woods and the deadly struggle at close quarters in the cornfield with such fearful loss of life took place . An officer who was on the battle fields of Magenta and Solferino , says that the scene here was much more horrible . Many spoke of the scenes they saw with a shudder . They could not throw off the impression made by the masses of wounded and dead ; the wounded often lying neglected and helpless under the dead , sometimes crushed to death by the wheels of our own artillery . Our left at Antietam was far off from the right : in these days of guns of long range the line of battle is longer than it was formerly . At Waterloo the Enb - lish occupied a front of less than two miles . In this battle ours was about four miles . In the battle of Solferino the engagement exteaded for eighteea miles . The contest on the left was fought by General Burnside with only one army corps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most gallant affair , but has excited less attention than the bloody fight on the right . In the dusty , tiresome march through Maryland , in th' skirmishes in and around Frederick , during the glorious hearty welcome our troops received in that old town , the advance , consisting of both Hooker 's and Reno 's army corps , had been commanded by Burnside . With them he had fought the successful and brilliant battle of South Mountain , coming to us so gratefully after the disastrous repulse and retreat of Pope . Reno had unfortunately fallen , and General Burnside took command of his corps : it was his old force from North Carolina , increased by General Cox 's Kanawha troops , and some new regiments , in all a little short of twenty thousand men . On the morning of the battle , Burnside took his station on the east side of the Antietam , in a field overlooking the country on the other side of the river . The gathering of his staff to their breakfast brought the shells of the enemy in their midst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some haystacks . On the same hill was placed a formidable battery of rifled cannon , throwing twenty-pound shot , commanded by Lieutenant Benjamin , // of the regular artillery . The guns are so heavy that they each have eight horses to drag them , and the caissons have six . There was unfortunately a short supply of ammunition , and the battery was fired slowly during the day . The guns were well placed and served , and aimed with wonderful accuracy . Shells were planted in two of the enemy 's ammunition carts , blowing them to pieces ; ad the fire of cannon was so hot that it compelled a rebel battery tv* miles off coming down a road to get into position , to wheel round and gallop over the hill . Proud , indeed , were the Lieutenant 's men of their exploits on that day , and wonderful stories they told of their famous battery . The Antietam in front of Burnside was deep , not fordable , flowing in the bottom of a charming valley , and overshadowed by trees . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches , rising picturesquely in the centre with stone parapets on the sides , the parapets spreading at both ends of the structure . One would almost imagine that it was an old Italian bridge transported to our wooden-building land . The side of the valley held by the rebel troops rises sharply , not densely wooded , but covered by large trees thickly placed , as in an old English park . Along the top of this ridge ran a solid stone wall , thicker and of heavier stones than any we saw in the neighborhood . Where the wall ended rifle pits had been dug . Behind the massive trunks , and in the branches of the old trees , behind this wall and in the pits , were crowded the sharpshooters of the rebels . The ascent from the bridge out of the valley on the enemy 's side , was too steep for a straight road up the ridge . If ever a bridge could be defended , that should have been ; the only disadvanta*e the rebels were under was that they could not sweep it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge ; twice had they been repulsed . On the right our troops were hard pressed ; much of the ground gained in the morning had beeen lost ; Hooker was wounded , Sumner 's corps routed Mansfield killed , and his corps beaten back . Then McClellan ordered Burnside to take the bridge , ad hold it at any cost . Burnside sent some troops farther down the river , where it was fordable , lie called up one of his old brigades that had been with him in North Carolina , saying , if any brigade could take the bridge , that one would . It was composed of the 51st New York , 51st Pennsylvania , 21st Massachusetts , and a Rhode Island regiment ; on their colors were inscribed , Roanoke , ' Newbern , ' two of our most glorious victories . With these veteran troops was the 35th Massachusetts , a new regiment that had left home only a month before , but who nobly did their part . Down went the 51st Pennsylvania in column in the advance , at the run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge , bringing down the rebels from the trees , suffering themselves , but never halting . They crossed and deployed on the other side . Next came the 35th Massachusetts , over the bridge , up the valley , then forming in line of battle on the top of the small hill commanding the stream . The enemy were drawn up before them , quite a distance off , on the top of the next hill . Every inch of ground between was commanded by the rebel fire ; but our brave fellows charged on up this hill , driving the foe before them : they did not halt there , for another still higher hill , which could now for the first time be seen farther on , rose up before them . Nothing daunted , they followed up their charge , and drove the enemy from this hill , and took this most commanding position . There they halted , close to Sharpsburg , almost in the rear of the rebels . Some of our troops even penetrated to Sharpsburg itself , and were taken prisoners . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct // retreat to the Potomac . Rebel troops were seen hurrying on the road to the river . Our men were now fired upon by artillery , and attacked by fresh bodies of infantry coming up , as the enemy say m their account , from Harper 's Ferry . Our brave fellows , however , stood their ground , waiting for reinforcements , which Burnside called for . But McClellan , unfortunately , dared not throw in his reserves ; his object had probably been gained in making a diversion from the hard contested field on our right . Our gallant fellows had to stand there unsupported until their ammunition gave out ; they fired their sixty rounds of ammunition , collecting all they could from their dead and wounded comrades , and then began to retreat . Benjamin 's battery of artillery was also short of ammunition , and could not support them . Our brave boys only retreated to the next hill , not to the hill above the Antietam , and then lay on their arms during the night , and there they stayed during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounds of earth , covering fallen heroes , point out the course of our soldiers all the way from this side of the Antietam to the top of the farthest hill . Here our men were so much more exposed than the rebels that our loss was greater than theirs . On the right the rebel loss was much the larger . In the battle beyond the river , the Hawkins Zouaves , another of the regiments distinguished in North Carolina , captured a rebel battery at the point of the bayonet . In the rebel account we are told how the brave General Toombs , with a whole brigade , retook the battery and defeated this single regiment , which they magnify into an immense force . General McClellan , with all his knowledge and great skill and success in defensive warfare , as shown in his Peninsular campaign , after our defeat at Gaines 's Mill , is wanting in the ra pidity of comprehension and audacity which are necessary components of the highest military talent . He waits for too many chances , and fears any risk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh men under Fitz John Porter in the centre . The enemy had probably used their last soldier , for the correspondent of the Charleston Courier , who has given the best rebel account of the battle , impliedly states that they had no reserves left . Ignorant of our unused troops , he laments the want of a few more rebel men , and says , that if only five thousand of their stragglers , who were on the way to Winchester , had been present , a most decisive rebel victory would have been obtained . If McClellan had added Fitz John Porter 's reserve to Burnside 's soldiers , he would have had nearly thirty-five thousand men flanking the enemy , already beaten , and threatening their retreat across the Potomac . Who knows what those fresh men might not have done ? Many think that the doubtful victory would have ended in the most brilliant decided success , and the stone bridge of . Antietam would have stood in history by the side of Arcola and Lodi . But let us be thankful for what we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , discouraged , defeated , demoralized , and even mutinous army , that had suffered terribly in killed and wounded , and lost prisoners and large numbers of cannon and material , was again reformed , and marched triumph utly against a victorious foe ; achieved on Sunday the brilliant victory of South Mountain , and on Wednesday fought the bloody fight of Antietam . There we c* ptured cannon , small arms , and standards , and lost none . Many have forgotten that ever since spring the rebels have boasted that the war was to be carried within our territory ; that they had begun this programme ; and that General Lee in entering Maryland had issued a boasting proclamation , promising to redeem it from a hated tyranny . If he had // succeeded , and defeated McClellan , as he had beaten Pope between Manassas and Washington , we had no reinforcements or forts to prevent his march to Philadelphia . McClellan 's presence stirred the common soldier as Napoleon 's did , and it was this unbounded enthusiasm which he excited , that saved the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing that made me more indignant than the folly of some ladies who , among his soldiers on the Potomac , decried and denounced him as an imbecile . What treachery can be worse than the attempt to destroy the confidence of the soldiers in their leader , when their lives depend upon his judgment and skill , and there can be only dejection and despair when that judgment and skill are doubted . Upon our return from the battle field to Pleasant Valley , we heard that orders to McClellan to advance had come from Washington . The only answers to inquiries when the advance would take place , were ominous shakings of the head or shrugs of the shoulders , which were indicative of anything but belief in a speedy movement . We also heard of the appointment of General Burnside to the command of three army corps , the precursor of a greater command yet to come . We have in our new commander-in-chief a general who has an implicit belief that our cause is just , and a trust in Providence that he will make the just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general who believed in Providence , and who has always shown great reverence in his writings . General McClellan is reticent . You can , however , tell somewhat of the opinion of the head of the house from his children and judging from the tone of belief among the General 's military family , from that long delay after Antietam , it was pretty evident that in his opinion the South can not be subdued , and that the question between us was a matter of boundary . With General Bumside we have no such belief . His faults , if they are faults , are those of the bold general , not of the Fabian order . At Newbern he brought at once into the fight every soldier he had , not keeping one in reserve ; and he gained the battle by his audacious policy . And it is the wonder to this day of every one who has been over the battle field , that the enemy should have been beaten . With all this boldness , he is a modest man ; twice before having refused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time Pope was appointed ; again when McClellan took ft before Washington . Of a commanding figure , every inch a soldier , one can not look upon him and his kindly eye without instant admiration . His modest way of riding *mong the men , alone or attended by a single orderly , will make him beloved by our republican soldiers . He was so then , and Old Burn , ' as they familiarly called him , was everywhere he rtily received . By the way , leClellan 's nickname on the Peninsula was George , ' and not Little Mac , ' as is generally supposed . General Burnside , we believe , is a good judge of men . The generals he selected for his North Carolina expedition , though previously unkno *n , and but captains in the service , have already distinguished themselves and justified his choice . General Foster , now commanding the department of North Carolina , has shown himself an able , active general . All who have been connected with him , speak highly of him . Though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts troops : he was first at Annapolis , and picked out for the first brigade the Massachusetts soldiers . Recently , through the Governor , he has obtained some eight or ten more regimnents , and in some way or other he has the crack ones . General Reno , who was Buraside 's second brigadier , has made a reputation that will live forever in bis country 's history . At the battle of Roanoke the little general , but a month before a // captain of ordnance , stood up fearlessly in the swamp amid his men , when they were lying down by his direction , and coolly gave his orders and encouraged them , entirely regardless of the balls flying round him on every side . In Pope 's retreat , and amid disaster and defeat , he acquired new reputation by his skill , energy , and daring . A Virginian by birth , he was truly a loyal man ; and , unlike some generals of our army corps , obeyed orders , and did all that could be done for the country and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispositions were good , if he had only been obeyed , should weigh much in that general 's favor . After the victory of South Mountain , he was reconnoitring the enemy , when he fell by a random shot , which came , so those who were in the action say , from some soldier of our force . Lyon , Kearny , Reno , gone ! Have we three such men left ? General Park , an accomplished soldier , who particularly distinguished himself at the battle of Newbern , was General Burnside 's third bri0adier . The country will feel renewed confidence from his remaining with our ncw commander as chief of staff . On the morning we left the camp , a squad from a new regiment just arrived had bean detailed for the guard at headquarters ; one of the sentries was smoking his pipe as he marched up and down ; another , who should have been patrolling his beat , was seated on the ground , cleaning his musket with a piece of wash leather he pulled from his pocket The General was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opinion that the boys in that regiment had never been to a country muster ; but they were stout fellows and looked like fight . At Sandy Hook , on the day of our return , we had to wait until nine in the evening for the train to Baltimore . Stuart 's cavalry had been over the road in the morning , making their escape into Virginia . They dared not stay to do mischief ; our forces were at all the important points . Considering the immense supplies in the rear of the army , Stuart did very little harm ; his eight hundred fresh horses were not worth the risk he ran . If he could have seized our supplies at Monocacy Station , and burnt the bridge there , he would have inflicted a serious loss upon the army . The nature of his raid seemed well understood , and there was no apprehension then of the enemy 's holding the railroad ; for the train from Baltimore had passed over the restored rails a few hours after the retreating troopers . At every important point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear that seven of the sick troopers , used up by their hard service , had fallen behind and been taken . We learned that General Pleasanton with some of our cavalry was in pursuit , and there were several stories about an engagement : the firing of cannon had been heard . General Pleasanton at that time was held in very little esteem , and seemed to have particularly disgusted those who had served under him , and was often cited as an example of McClellan 's lack of judgment in men . He appears since to have acquired a newspaper reputation for ability and energy . I only hope that it is ( leserved , and that the opinions we heard so often were not well founded . We arrived at the Baltimore depot at four in the morning amid a rain , and found it occupied by some one or two thousand soldiers , standing and sitting about in their blue overcoats with their arms stacked . Not a carriage could be obtained , and so , shouldering our bag in military fashion , we marched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , marking it as the headquarters of MajorGeneral Wool . We passed by unchallenged ; in our bag , however , we had rebel ammunition : a loaded shell fired at our men as they were crossing the stone bridge at Antietam . Fortunately // the fuse had gone out , and it remained a trophy for one of the despicable Down-East Yankees . We heard the old General was still the centre of attraction to the pretty secesh ladies who had friends or relatives in durance vile in Fort Ndllenry . The veteran hero , though rich , wears a uni form that shows the marks of service . That , however , does not prevent the constant presents of delicious fruit and beautiful flowers , and invitations to drive to the fort , from those bewitching belles of Baltimore : whereat some strong Union people grumble loudly .
