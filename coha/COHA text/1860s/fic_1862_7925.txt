Whitman , Sarah Helen , 1803-1878 : AFTER THE FIGHT AT MANASSAS. from After the fight at Manassas ( 1862 ) By the great bells swinging slow The solemn dirges of our woe , By the heavy flags that fall Trailing from the bastioned wall , Miserere , Domine ! By our country 's common blame , By our silent years of shame , By our curbed and bated breath Under dynasties of Death , Miserere , Domine ! By the sin we dared disown , Till its " dragon teeth " were sown , By the cause , yet unavowed , By the fire behind the cloud , Miserere , Domine ! By our Northern host betrayed , At Manassas ' bloody raid , By our losses unatoned  --  Our dead heroes , heart-enthroned , Miserere , Domine ! For Rhode Island 's gallant stand  --  Her " unconquerable band ; "  --  For the dear , familiar names , Now linked to old , historic fames , Te laudamus , Domine ! For our boys that knew not fear , For their " gallant Brigadier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their praise on every tongue ! Te laudamus , Domine ! By the hope that suffers long , And grows through holy sorrow strong , By all the starry flags unfurled , For the last war-field of the world , Give us , O God , the victory !  --  Providence Daily Journal , Aug. 6.
