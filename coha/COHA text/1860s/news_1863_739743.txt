txt The Louisville Journal , in an article highly laudatory of Gen. BURNSIDE , takes occasion to make this statement : " His order , No. 38 , has worked like a charm , and given peace , quiet and security to many portions of the State which have been infested by rebel sympathizers and marauders . Previous to its publication , many parts of the State were infested by MORGAN 'S men and other rebels , whose presence Drought fear and terror ; but since its enforcement there are none to be found within our lines , except a few desperate characters , who come and go secretly to act the spy ; and these are caught whenever found , and ex ecu ted . " This . order No. 38 was the same against which VALLANDIGHAM directed the seditious and incendiary speech which caused his military arrest , trial and punishment . He denounced it as " a base usurpation of arbitrary authority , " proclaimed that " he for one would not regard it , " and did his utmost to madden the people against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measure- would have been resisted and nullified before it Wei aday old , and its author been driven from the Department as a public enemy . The Kentucky paper which testifies concerning the practical effect of that order is no follower of the Administration . It is honestly for the war , but has habitually complained of the management of the war . It has agreed with Mr. CRITTENDEN and GARRET DATcs , and found little to approve in the general policy of the President . Yet it unequivocally gives its evidence that the military order for opposing which VALLANDIGHAM was arrested " has worked like a charm ; " giving " peace , quiet and security , " where before " fear and terror " onlylprevailed . If this testimony be accepted ? and no reasonable man will impeach it ? it follows that the rebel cause in Kentucky has seriously suffered in consequence of that military order ; and that VALLANDIGHAM , in trying to break down the order , was actually upholding the rebel cause so far as in him lay . The result , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he deserves the sympathy of none but disloyal men . It will not answer for VALLANDIGH4 M 'S friends to pretend that his denunciation of that order .. pplied only to its operation in Ohio , and not in Kentucky . He made no such discrimination . His language was put in the most unqualified form . It was the existence of the order that he railed against , and not its particular geographical scope . Like other orders emanating from the chief of a military department , it applied to the entire department , which includes Ohio as well as Kentucky . In fact , there was not a word in it calculated to wrong or endanger a truly loyal man in either State ; but VALLANDIGHAM made no particular claims for the citizens of one State over the other . He put in no special plea that Ohio was not-within the theatre of active war , and , therefore , should be exempt from military orders like No. 38 . He was more manly in this respect than some of his defenders . The geographical distinction is without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rebel army ? giving minute information to the enemy harboring , protecting , feeding and clothing those in the service of the enemy-7-the habitual public expression of sympathy for the enemy  --  are in both States an insufferable military injury . Doubtless , in some respects , the military circumstances of the two States differ  --  consequent upon the greater proximity of the one to the rebel lines  --  and , in some particulars , this may well make a difference in military management . But not the particulars named in this order No. 38 . Those are intolerable everywhere . VALLANDIGHAM did not pretend that they ought to be tolerated in one part of Gen. BURNSIDE 'S department and not in another . He took the broad ground that the order interdicting them and subjecting the violators to military punishment , wan a base usurpation of arbitrary authority , " and he labored to make an end of it without reserve . He defied it in all its strength , and struck at its very heart . We believe in giving even the arch-rebel himself his due , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the locomotive , made a very square issue . Even euotoosintf  --  which is not the Wail. ? that Gen. Bnineimen order put the people Of Ohio under uncomfortable restraint , true loyalty would have dictated patient submission to it . The fact that it was producing such an excellent effect in Kentucky , that it was giving that portion of the department a peace and security unknown there from the first outbreak of the rebellion , would have reconciled every man of genuine patriotism to it without a VALLANDIGHAM 'S special grievance was that the order subjected civilians to a military tribunal , and deprived them of the guarantee of a regular jury trial . He took no account that the offences specified were military injuries , and therefore rightly cognizable by military courts , but contended that it was usurpation and tyranny to arrest and try civilians by any other than civil process . Though he did not in so many words say it , yet his doctrine involved that rebels in Kentucky and insurgents against the enrollment in Ohio , should be unmolested until the civil magistrates of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrest , and should go unpunished until an impanneled jury of twelve men , ( traitors of every hue included , ) should unanimously agree to convict them . VALLANDIGHAM cared nothing for the obstructive and ruinous ' effect this sort of procedure would have upon military operations ; or , if be did care , it was only to be glad that he could thus paralyze the military arm , and help on the peace he had labored for from the beginning . But the citizen who wishes to strengthen the army , and to circumscribe the rebellion , would cheerfully submit to any limitations upon his ordinary civil rights that would contribute to that end . Even though he did not approve the particular scope or shape of a military order , so long as its practical operation was a benefit to the cause in any region ? as this order No. 38 has confessedly been in Kentucky ? if he did not express satisfaction , he at least would keep silent . Never would he undertake to use it as a means of exciting hatred and antagonism to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is that the animus of all this opposition to Gen. BURNSIDE 'S order was hostility to the war . It was essentially a disloyal spirit . And it is preciseli.the same which has prompted the nomination of VALLANDIG ? nem for the Governorship of Ohio . The prime object is to weaken the army and embarrass the Government . This talk about the vindication of free speech and jury trial ? is sheer duplicity . The assertion of civil rights in their extreme application comes not from any peculiar reverence for them intrinsically , but because it opens the way , as is imagined , to make the war impracticable . No artifice can hide this from the people of Ohio , the , great body of whom are thoroughly loyal . We have not the slightest apprehension of the result of the election . The people will ratify the action of the Government with an emphasis that will send dismay into every creature of the Vallandigham type , the wide land through .                @ @ @ @ @
