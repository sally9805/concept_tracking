ON THE RELATION OF ART TO NATURE . IN TWO PARTS . PART L THE notion that Painting and Sculpture are concerned oniy with the * imitation of Nature , " - that is , with copying the forms and colors of existing things ,  - -  though so often expelled , as it were , with a pitchfork , persistently recurs , not only in popular talk , but in deliberate criticism , and in the practice of artists . There are periods when this notion gets the upperhand , as at the end of the fifteenth century , and again at the end of the eighteenth , when Rousseau prescribed a return to Nature as the panacea for all defect , in Art as elsewhere . Then Wiuckelmaun and his successors triumphed over it for a while , - showed at least the crudity of that statement . This is the purpose of much of Sir Joshua Reynolds 's lectures . Now it seems to be coming up again , - thanks partly to Mr. Ruskin , though he might be quoted on both sides , - and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of photography , what it does in fact amount to . It is a very general opinion that pho-. tography has made painting superfluous , - or , at least , that it will do so as soon as further improvements in the process shall enable it to render color as well as light and shade . And our artists seem to give in to this view , in the deference they show to the subject , as if it mattered not so much what it was , or how , as that it is there , - a pious tenderness towards barns and rail-fences and stone walls and the confused monotony of the forest , not as having any special fitness , not as beautiful , but because they exist , - a scrupulous anxiety to give the everyday look of the objects they portray , as any passer - by would see them , free from any distorting personality . To do them justice , however , this submissiveness to the matter-of-fact , with the more gifted at least , is a virtue that is praised and starves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when they come to paint , they are under a spell that does not allow them to see in things only material qualities , but , without any violence to Nature , raises it to a higher plane , where oth5 value , s and other connections prevail . Art , where it exists to any serious purpose , follows Nature , but not the natural ,  --  according to Raphael 's maxim , that " the artist 's aim is to make things not as Nature makes them , but as she intends them . " But these audacities , though they make their own excuse in the work itself , do not pass in a statement without cavil at the arrogance that would exalt the work of men 's hands above the work of God . Shall we strive with our pigments to outshine the sun , or teach the secrets of form to the cunning Artificer by whom the world was made ? What room for Art , except as the feeble reflex of the splendors of the actual world ? But if that be all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from upholstery ? Why pile our mole-hills by the side of the mountains ? We can see the landscape itself any day ; - whence this extraordinary interest in seeing a bit of it painted , - except , indeed , as furniture for the drawing-room , to be ordered with the frame at so much the yard from the picture-dealer ? The root of the difficulty lies in this slippery phrase , Nature . We talk of the facts of Nature , meaning the existence now and here of the hills , sky , trees , etc. , as if these were fixed quantities , - as if a house or a tree must be the same at all times and to everybody . But in a child 's drawing we see that these things are not // the same to us and to him . He is careful to give the doors and windows , the chimneys with their smoke , the lines of the fence , and the walk in front ; he insists on the divisions of the bricks and the window - panes : but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie gives what the house is to him , merely a house in general , any house ; it would not help it , but only make the defect more prominent , to straighten and complete the lines . An artist , with fewer and more careless lines , would give more of what we see in it ; and if he be a man of high power , he may teach us in turn the limitation of our seeing , by showing that the vague , half- defined sentiment that attaches to it has also a visible expression , if we knew where to look for it . We hear people say they know nothing of Art , but that they can judge as well as anybody whether a picture is like Nature or not . No doubt Giotto 's contemporaries thought so , too , and they were grow a men , with senses as good as ours ; but we smile when Boccaecio says , " There was nothing in Nature that Giotto could not depict , whether with the pencil , the pen , or the brush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thing itself . " We smile superior , but Giotto had as keen an eye and as ready a hand as any man since . The lesson is , that we , too , have not come to the end of even the most familiar objects , but that to another age our view of them may seem as queer as his seems to us . For the facts in Nature are not fixed , hut transcendental quantities , and their value depends on the use that is made of them . It is in this direction that the artist 's genius avails ; his skill in execution is secondary and incidental . The measure of his ability is the depth to which he has penetrated the world of matter , not the number or the accuracy of his facts . Every landscape wears many faces , as many as there are men and different moods of the same man . To one the forest is so many cords of wood ; to another , an arboretum ; to another , a workshop or a museum ; to another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the forest exists for beauty and for firewood , and lends itself indifferently to either use . Nature wears this air of impartiality , because her figures are only zeros , deriving all their significance from their position . We do not require a like impartiality in the artist , because what he is to give is not Nature , but what Nature inspires . His endeavor to be impartial would result only in giving us his opinions or the opinions of others , instead of the utterance of the oracle . For Nature hides her secret , not by silence , but in a Babel of sweet voices , heard by each according to the fineness of his sense : by one as mere noise , by another as a jangle of pleasing sounds , by the artist as harmony . They are all of them Nature 's voices ; - he adds nothing and omits nothing , but hears with a preoccupied attention , the justification being that his hearing is thus most complete , as one who understands a language seizes the sense of words rapidly spoken better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sounds . The test of " truth , " therefore , in the sense of fact , is insufficient . The question is , Truth for whom ? Not for a child or a savage . If we were to show a fine landscape to a Hottentot , it would be a mistake to say he saw it , though the image might be demonstrable on the retina of his eye . He would not see what we mean when we speak of it , any more than we should see the footstep on the ground or hear the stirring in the grass that is plain enough to him , and hits our organs , too , though we are not trained to perceive it . If the test of merit be the production of a likeness to something we see , then the artist should know no more of Nature than we do . But then , though it may surprise us into momentary admiration to recognize familiar things in this translation ,  --  just as common talk sounds finer in a foreign tongue , - yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limitations of the counterfcit come in , - its narrowness and fixity , - crude paint for // sunbeams , cold and colorless stone for the living form . The only test of a work of Art is , how far it will carry us , - not any comparison by the yardstick . We demand to be raised above our habitual point of view , and be made aware of a deeper interest than we knew of . It is in hope of this alone that we pardon the necessary shortcoming of the means . This deeper interest has its root in nothing arbitrary , or personal to the artist . It is not inventing something finer than Nature , but seeing more truly what Nature shows , that makes the artistic faculty . This is the lesson taught by the history of Art . Take it up where you will , this history is nothing but th' successive unfolding of a truer conception of Nature , only speaking here the language of form and color , instead of words . lit is this that lies at the bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in its prosperity . Where the human form is the theme , the aim must of course be to give its typical perfection . No naturalist describes the defects of his specimens , though it may happen that all are imperfect . Comparatively few persons ever saw our robin in the plumage in which it is always described . Only in early spring , not very commonly then , is the black of the head and tail seen pure . But no one hesitates to call this the true color . The sculptor does not reproduce the peculiarities of his model , but aims to give ideal form as the most natural form of man . But in Painting , and especially in Landscape , it seems less easy to fix upon any ideal , not only from the multifariousness of the details , but , nbove all , from the elusiveness of the standard . We might agree upon an ideal of human beauty , but hardly upon the ideal of anything else . The sophist in the Hippias Major was prepared to define the beauty of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confounded when it was required that the beauty of a pipkin should be deducible from the same principle , and yet worse when it was shown to involve that a wooden spoon was more beautiful than a gold one . What you see in the woods and mountains depends on what you go for and what you carry with you . We may go to them as to a quarry or a wood-pile , or for pleasantness , - the cool spring and the plane-tree shade , as the ancients did , - or to see fine trees , waterfalls , mountains . To many persons the beauty of any scene is measured by its abundance in such specimens of streams , mountains , waterfalls , etc . Of course the connection is demonstrable enough : one collocation of features is more readily suggestive of beauty than another . We expect to find the scenery of a hill-country more attractive than a sand- desert . But comparing a landscape with a statue , or even Painting generally with Sculpture , the connection between a happy effect and any definite arrangement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than the ingredients . It is in every one 's experience that an accidental light , or even an accidental susceptibility , will impart to the mengrest landscape - a bare marsh , a scraggy hillpasture - a charm of which the separate features , or the whole , at another time , give no hint . Often mere bareness , openness , absence of objects , will arouse a deeper feeling than the most famous scenes . We learn from such experiences that the difference between one patch of earth and another is wholly superficial , and indicates not so much anything in it as a greater or less dulness in us . The celebrated panoramas and points of view are not the favorite haunts of great painters . They do not need to travel far for their subjects . Mr. Ruskin tells us that Turner did not paint the high Alps , nor the cumulus , the grandest form of cloud . Calame gives us the nooks and lanes , the rocks and hills , of Switzerland , rather than the high peaks ; Lambinet , an apple-orchard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - not cataracts or forests . This is not affectation or timidity , but an instinct that the famotis scenes are no breaks in the order of Nature , - that // what is seen in them is visible elsewhere as well , only not so obvious , and that the office of Art is not to parrot what is already distinct , but to reveal it where it is obscure . This makes the inspiration of the artist ; this is the source of all his power , and alone distinguishes him from the topographer and vieWmaker . This transcendentalism is more evident in Painting , as the later and more developed form ; but it is common to all Art , and may be read also in the Greek sculptures . The experience of every one who with some practice of eye cor*es for the first time to see the best antiques is not that he falls at once to admiriug theperfection of their anatomy , and wondering at the symmetry and complete development of the men and women of those days , but rather that he is carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which returning he discovers that his previous acquaintance with Sculpture was with masks only , and that the meaning of plastic art as a capital interest of the human mind is now for the first time made known to him . He sees that it was no whim of the Greeks , but an instinct of the infinity it typifies , that made them take the human form as alone possessing beauty enough to stand by itself . iNot the images of their deities alone , but all their statues were gods . The charm of the Lizard-Slayer of Praxiteles , or of those kmmortal riders that swept along the friezes of the Parthenon , is something quite distinct from the beauty of a naked boy playing with an arrow , or a troop of Athenian citizens on horseback . These are the deathless forms of the happy Olympians , high above the cares and turmoil of the finite , self-centred and independent . It is the Paradise age of the world , before the knowledge of good and evil , before sin and death came the worship of the Visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , behold , it was very good . Hence the air of repose , of eternal duration , that marks these figures . They have nothing to regret or to hope , no past or future , but only a timeless existence . It is from this essential self-sufficingness , not from fancied rules , that Sculpture is limited with respect to dramatic expression , that is , expression of passing feeling , accidental action , not identified with the form . In the best period the first requisite was that the interest should be thoroughly id9ntified with the shape in which it is manifested , and not unparted , as by history , association , etc . The decline began when this lofty isolation was felt as negative , needing to have interest and expression added to it . But whatever was added only emphasized without curing the defect . Even the " awful diagonal " of the Laocobn and the godlike triumph of the Belvedere Apollo show a lower age . Why triumph , if he was supreme before ? These are casual incidents only , examples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate concbisive embodiment of an idea . The more elaborately the meaning is wrou* , ht into the form , the more evident that they are not originally identical . In Modern Sculpture this deification of the human form is either expressly banished from the artist 's aim , or at least he is not quite in eartiest with it . For instance , in Mr. Palmer 's White Captive , - exhibited not long since in Boston , - the sculptor 's account of his work is , that it portrays an American girl captured by Indians and bound to a tree . We have to take with us the history ahd the circumstances : a Christian woman of the nineteenth century , dragged from her civilized home and helpless in the hands of savages . This is not at all incidental to the work , but the work is incidental to it . It is a story which the figure helps to tell . This is no universal type of womanhood , nor even American womanhood . American women do not stand naked in the streets , but go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure ; if we must needs represent one naked , we must invent some such accident , some extraordinary // dislocation of all usual relations and circumstances . in place of the antique harmony of character and situation , we have here a painful incongruity that no study or skill can obviate . Nor has Modern Sculpture any better success , when , instead of the pretence of history , it adopts the pretence of personification . Its highest result in this direction is , perhaps , Thorwaldsen 's bas-relief of Night , - a pretty parlor-ornament . There is a fatal sense of unreality about works of this kind that even Thorwaldsea 's genius was unable to remove . They are toys , and it seems rather fiat to have toys so cumbrous and so costly . The reason of this insipidity is , that the ideality aimed at is all on the outside . There is no soul in these bodies , but only an abstraction ; and so the body remains an abstraction , too . In each case the radical defect is the same , namely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not coalesce , but are only arbitrarily connected . We can not have these ideal forms , because we do not believe in them . . We do not believe in gods and goddesses , but in men and women ; that is , we do not at last really identify the character with its manifestation . Such was the fascination of beauty to the Greek mind , that it banished all other considerations . What mattered it to Praxiteles whether his Satyr was a useful member of society or not , or whether the young Apollo stood thus idle and listless for an instant or for a millennium , as long as he was so beautiful ? And the charm so penetrated their works that something of it reaches down even to us , and holds us as long as we look upon them . But as soon as we quit the magic circle , the illusion vanishes , - Apollo is a handsome vagabond whom we incline to send about his business . He ought to be slaying Pythons and drying up swamps , instead of loitering here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the ancients did in heroes ,  --  but in representative men , that is , in ideas , and in men as representing them . Washington is not to us what Achilles or Agamemnon was to the Greeks . The form of Achilles would do as well for a god ; the antiquaries do not know whether the Ludovisi Mars was not an Achilles , - perhaps nobody ever knew . But in all our veneration of Washington , it is not his person we revere , but his virtues ,  --  precisely the impersonal part of him , or his person only from association . There is nothing incongruous in this association as it exists in the mind , any more than there would have been in his presence , because of the overpowering sense of his character and history , to which all the outward show of the man is constantly subordinate . But if we isolate this by making a statue of him , we have only an apotheosis of cocked-hat and small-clothes , in which we see what it really was.to us . This awkward prominence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern dress , but from our unconscious repugnance to petrifying the man in one of his aspects . It is a touch of grave humor in the genius of Art , thus to give us just what we ask for , though not what we want . The Greeks could have portrait-statues , because all they looked for in the man they saw in his form , and , seeing it , could portray it . If the modern sculptor truly saw in the figure of Washington all that the name means to him , he could make a statue woethy to be placed by the side of the Sophocles and the Phocion . These were true portraits , no doubt ; thus it was that these men appeared to their fellow-citizens ; but it does not follow that they would have am peared so to us . What they saw is there ; it is a reality both for them and for us ; but the literal identification of it with the form belongs to them , not to us , and our mimicry of it can result only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these finite shapes , on which , by an illusion , it seemed to rest . The Greek statues are tropes , which we gladly allow in their original use , but , repeated , they become flat and pedantic . Hence the air of caricature in modern portrait-statues ; for caricature does not necessarily imply // falsification , but only that what is given isinsisted on at the expense of more important truth . To the view of the early Christian ages , too , the body is old clothes , ready to be cast off at any moment , good only as means to something higher . It might seem that Christianity should give a higher value to the body , since it was believed to have been inhabited by God himself . But the Passion was a fact of equal ilaportance with the Incarnation . This honor could be allowed to matter only for an instant , and on the condition of immediate resumption . That the Highest should suffer death as a man might well seem to the Greeks foolishness . To the understanding it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete statement of what is involved in the Greek worship of beauty . The complete incarnation of Spirit , which is the definition of beauty , demands equally that there be no point it does not inhabit , and none in which it abides . The transience of things is no defect in them , but only the affirmation of their reality through the incessant casting-off of its inadequate manifestations . It is not from the excellence , but from the impotence of its nature , that the stone endures and does not pass away as the plant and the animal . The higher the organization , the more rapid and thorough the circulation . The same truth holds in Art , also , and drives it to forsake these beautiful petrifactions and seek an expression less bound to the material . Ideal form is good so far as it brings together in one compact image what in Nature is scattered and partial ; but it is an ideality of the surface only , not of the substance . It shuts out the defect of this or that form , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all a thing , and its impassive perfection a stony death . The justification is , that the sculptor did not say quite what he meant . He said flesh , but he meant spirit , and this is what the Greek statues mean to us . The modern sculptor does not mean spirit , andknows that he does not ; and so , with all his efforts , he gives us only the outside . Is it asked , Whence this divorce of flesh and spirit ? why not give both at once as Nature does ? Then we must do as Nature does , and make our forms as fluid as hers . But tkis the sculptor contravenes at the outset . To follow Nature , he should make his statue of snow . To make it of stone is to pretend that the form is something of itself This the Greeks never meant , for then it would follow that all parts of it were alike significant . Haydon was delighted to find reproduced in the Elgin marbles certain obscure and seeming insignificant details of the anatomy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin under the armpit of the Neptune , etc . But any beginner at a life-school could have pointed out in the same statue endless deficiencies in anatomical detail . The fold was put in , not because it was there , but because to the mind of the Greek artist it meant something . Sculptors of the present day comfort themselves with the belief that their works are more complete and more accurate in the anatomy than the antique . Very likely , for the ancients did not dissect . But this accuracy , if it is founded on no interest beyond accuracy , is after all an impertinence . The Greek ideal is founded on the exclusion of accident . It is a declaration that the casual shape is not the true form ; it is only a step farther to the perception that all shape is casual , - the reality seen , not in it , but through it . The ideal is then no longer perfect shape , but transparency to the sentiment ; the image is not sought to be placed before the beholder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Henceforth , suggestion only is aimed at , not representation ; the cooperation of the spectator is relied upon as the indispensable complement of the design . The Zeus of Phidias seemed to the Greeks , Plotinus says , Zeus himself , as he would be , if he chose to appear to human eyes . But a Crucifixion is of itself not at all what the artist meant . It is not the agony of the flesh , but the tri // umph of the spirit , that is intended to be portrayed . If the end be attained , the slighter and more unpromising the means the better . Thus a new scale of values is established ; nothing is worthy or unworthy of itself ; nothing is excluded , but also in nothing is the interest identified with the thing , but imparted . Christian Art , after mere tradition had died out , - for instance , in the Byzantine and early Italian pictures from . the eighth to the middle of the thirteenth century , - presents the strongest contrast to all that had gone before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these figures seems like contempt not only of beauty , but of all natural expression . They are meaningless of themselves , and quite indifferent to the character they represent , which is appended to them by inscriptions , - their relative importance , even , indicated only by size , more or less splendor of costume , * etc. , but the faces all alike , and no attempt made tp adapt the action to the occasion . It is another world they belong to ; the present they pointedly renounce and disdain , condescending to communicate with it only indirectly and by signs . The main peculiarities were common to Painting and Sculpture , though most noticeable in Painting . An interest in the actual world seems never so far lost sight of , and earlier revived , in Sculpture . Even down to the spring-tide of Modern Art in the thirteenth century , the " pleasant days " when Guido of Siena was painting his Ma donna , the improvement in Painting was rather a stirring within the cerements of conventional types , a flush on the cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bas-reliefs of the Pisan sculptors we meet already a realism as much in excess of the antique as the Byzantine fell short of it . It is commonly said that Nicola Pisano revived Art through study of the antique ; his models , even , are pointed out , particularly a sarcophagus , said to have been brought to Pisa in the eleventh century from Greece . But this sarcophagus , wherever it came from , is not Greek , but late Roman work ; and we find in Nicola no mark of direct Greek influence , but only of the late Roman and early Christian sarcophagus-sculptures . In the reliefs upon his celebrated pulpit at Pisa we have the same short-legged , largeheaded , indigenous Italian or Roman figures , and the same arrangement of hair , draperies , etc. , as on those sarcophagi . Taken by themselves , his works would , no doubt , indicate a new direction . But by the side of his son Giovanni , or the sculptors of the Northern cathedrals , he seems to belong to the third century rather than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinctly announced . The Inferno , usually ascribed to him , among the relief* on the front of Orvieto Catbedral , * and in his noble pulpit at Pistoia , shows the traces of the antique only in unimportant details , ornamentation , etc : The antique served him , no doubt , a a hint to independent study , but the whole intent is different ,  --  all the beauties and all the defects arrived at by a different road . In place of the unpassive Minos of the Shades , we have a fiend , serpent - girt4 his judicial impartiality enforced apparently against his will by manacles and anklets of knotted snakes ; and throughout , instead of the calm impersonality of the Greek , dealing out the typical forms of things like a law of Nature , we have the restless , intense , partisan , modern man , not wanting in ten ( lerness , but full of a noble scorn at the unworthiness of the world , and grasping at a reality beyond it . He is intent , first of all and at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and spee ( hily oiitruns the possibilities of his material . He must make his creatures alive to the last superficies ; and as he can not give them motion , he puts an emphasis upon all their bones , sinews , veins , and wrinkles , - every feather is carved , * See Mr. Norton 's " Travel and Study in Italy , " p. 182. t " Giudica e manda , secondo che avvin ghia. " // and even the fishes under the water show their scales . That mere literalness is not the aim is shown by the open disregard of it elsewhere ; for instance , the size of each figure is determined , not by natural rules , but by their relative importance , so that in the Nativity , Mary is twice as large as Joseph and three times as large as the attendants . And the detail is not everywhere equally minute , but follows the intensity of the theme , reaching its height in the lower compartment , where the damned are in suffering , and especially in the figures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a struggle for an emphasis beyond the reach of Sculpture , - taking these means in despair of others , and , in its thirst for expression , careless alike of natural probability , typical perfection of form , and pleasing effect . Different as it seems , the same spirit is at work here and in Painting . In both it is the repudiation of the classic ideal , - in Sculpture by a re ( luctio ad alsurdum , putting its implicit claims to the test of realization , - in Painting by mere negation , as was natural at the outset of a new career , before the means of any positive expression were discovered . Ideal form was to the Greeks the highest result , the success of the universe . The end of Art was conceived *ms Nature 's end as well , whether actually attained or not . Nor was this preference of certain forms arbitrary , but it followe ( l the plain indications written on every particle of matter . What we call brute matter is whatever is means only , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handful of earth is definable only by it chemical or physical properties , which do not distinguish it , but confound it with other things . By itself it is only so much phosphate or silicate , and can come to be something only in a foreign organism , a plant or an animal . In form is seen the dawning of individuality , and just as the thing rises in the scale the principle of form becomes dominant . The handful of earth is sufficiently described by the chemist 's formula , - these ingredients make this substance . But an organic body can not be so described . The chemist 's account of sugar , for instance , is C0 1110 0 ' . But if we ask what starch is , we have , again , C6 H ' 0 0 ' ,  --  and the cellular tissue of plants , also , is the same . These things , then , as far as he knows , are identical . Evidently , he is beyond his depth , and the higher we go in the scale the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the separate importance of the material ingredients constantly decreasing , ahd the importance of their definite connection increasing , as the reference to an individual centre predominates over helpless gravitation . First , aggregation about a centre , as in the crystal , - then , arrangement of the parts , as upper , under , and lateral , as in the plant , - then , organization of these into members . Form is the self- assertion of the thing as no longer means only ; this makes its attractiveness to the artist . The root of his delight in ideal form is that it promises some finality amid the endless maze of matter . But this higher completeness , which is beauty , whether it happen to exist or not , is never the immediate aim of Nature . It is everywhere implied , but nowhere expressed ; for Nature is unwearied in producing , but negligent of the product . As soon as the end seems anywhere about to be attained , it is straightway made means again to something else , and so ' on forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a plant , the flower into fruit , the fruit into flesh , and the animal at last to die and give back again to the air and the earth what they have transmitted to him . Whatever beauty a thing has is by the way , not as the end for which it exists , and so it is left to be baffled and soiled by accident . This is the " jealousy of the gods , " that could not endure that anything should exist without some flaw of imperfection to confess its mortal birth . The world is full of beauty , but as it were hinted , - as in the tendency to make the most conspicuous things the most beautiful , as flowers , fruits , birds , // the insects of the sunshine , the fishes of the surface , the upper side of the leaf ; and perhaps more distinctly ( in accordance with Lord Bacon 's suggestion that " iNature is rather busy not to err , than in labor to produce excellency " ) in the tendency to hide those that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worms , insects that flee the light , the fishes of the bottom , the intestines of animals . But these are hints only , and Nature , as Mr. Ruskin confesses , will sometimes introduce " not ugliness only , but ugliness ifs the wrong place . " XVere beauty the aim , it should be most evident in her chief products ; whereas it is in things transient , minute , subordinate , - flowers , snowflakes , the microscopic details of structure , - tiat it meets us most invariably , rather than in the higher animals or in man . Nor in man does it keep pace with his civilization , but obeys laws that bclong to the lower regions of his nature . This ambiguity of every fact in Nature comes from the difficulty of detecting its true connection . There is reality there , even in blight and corruption ; something is forwArded , only perhaps not the thing before us , - as the virtue of the compost-heap appears not in it , but in the rose-bed . The artist can not forego a jot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , any snore than the canvas and the pigment are the picture . The prose of every-day life is reality in fragments , - the Alps split into paving-stones , - Achilles with a cold in the head . Seen in due connection , they make up the reality ; but their prominence as they occur is casual and shifting , and the result dependent on the spectator 's power of discerning , amid the endless series in which they are involved , more or less of their vital relations . Art is not to be blamed for idealizing , for this is only completing what Nature begins . But the completion of the design is also its limitation . It is final to the artist as well as to the theme , and can not yield to further expansion . In Nature there is no such pretence of finality , and so her work , though never complete , is never convicted of defect . Her circuits are never closed ; she does not aim to cure the defect in the thing , but in something else . Each in turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which never is , but always about to be . The reason is , that the scope of each is wider than immediately appears . It is not simple completeness that is aimed at , but ascent to higher levels , so that the consummation it demands , if granted , would cut it off from more vital connections elsewhere . The ideal of the crystal seems to be clearness and regularity , but better things are in store for it . It must become opaque and shapeless in order to be fitted for higher transformations . The leaf must be cramped to make the flower . Homer 's heroes must hoe potatoes and keep shop before the higher civilization of the race can be reached . The Greek ideal is an endeavor to ignore the imperfections of natural existence . The ideal life is to be rich , strong , powerful , eloquent , high - born , famous . It was a glorification of the earthly , not by transcendin* , but by keeping its limitations out of sight . But this is only making the limitation essential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which in this very avoidance subnuts to recognize it . The statue is not less , bijt more , a thing than the natural body . Life is not mere exclusion of decay , but organization of it , so that the fury of corruption passes into fresh vital power . It is a cycle of changes , the type and show of which are the circulation , constantly removing effete particles and building up new , and therein giving its hue to the flesh . But sculpture supposes the current checked , and one aspect fit to stand for all the rest . The statue is not only a particle , but an isolated particle , and must first of all divert attention from its fragmentariness . Mr. Garbett has remarked that plants should not he copied in sculpture , because the plant is not seen entire , but is partly hidden in the ground . But the point is not the being seen or not , but the suggestion // of incompleteness . The same remark applies to animals , and even to man , unless his relations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept out of sight . But the finite thus isolated is not honored , but degraded . This stagnant perfection is atrophy , - as some poisons are said to kill by arresting the transformation of the tissues , and so to preserve them at the expense of their life . The new era is marked by the perception that these shortcomings are not accidental , but inherent and intended . The chasm is not to be bridged or avoided ,  - -  or , as Plato says , the human to become godlike by taking away here and adding there , - but remains a radical incongruity of Nature , never to be escaped from . It brings death and dissolution to the fair shapes of the earlier world ,  - -  for the worship of form is justified only so long as the mind thinks forms and not ideas . The statue may embody an infinite meaning , but to the artist form and meaning are one . It is not a sentiment that he puts into this shape , but it is the shape itself that inspires him . The symbolism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We know what is meant by Circe and Athene , but Homer did not . It was thus only that the Greek mind oould grasp ideas , - this is the thoroughly artistic character of that people . Their philosophers were always outlaws . What excited the rage of the Athenians against Socrates was his endeavor to detach religion from the images of the gods . When it comes to comparisons between meaning and expression , as adequate or inadequate , it is evident their unity is gone ; - the meaning is first , and the expression only adjunct or illustration . It did not impair the sacredness of the Greek deities that they were the work of the poets and sculptors . But the second Nicene Council forbade as impious any images of Christ as God , and allowed only his human nature to be represented , - a strange decree , if the Church had realized its own doctrine , that the humanity of Christ is as real as his divinity . But the meaning is , that the finite is not there to stand for the infinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that its glory is not to persist in its finiteness , not to hold on to its form , but to be transformed . The figure of Thersites would he very unsuitable for Achilles , but is suitable enough for a saint ; it was a pardonable exaggeration to make it even more suitable . The hero is now the saint ; the ideal life a life of poverty , humility , weakness , labor , - to be long - suffering , to despise and forsake the world . The present life , the heaven of Achilles , is now 1-lades , the forced abode of phantoms having no reality but what is given to them by religion , and the Hades of the Greek the only true and substantial world . The new church fled the light of the sun , and sought impatiently to bury itself in the tomb . The Roman catacombs were not the mere refuge of a persecuted sect , - their use as places of worship continued long after such need had ceased . But " among the graves " they found the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the darkness made it easier to ignore for the few miserable moments that yet remained the vain tumult of the surface . In such a mood the beauty of the outward could awaken no delight , but only suspicion and aversion . Not the earth and its glories , but the fading of these before the unseen and eternal , was the only possible inspiration of Art . The extreme of this direction we see in the Iconoclasm of the eighth century , but it has never completely died out . Gibbon tells us of a Greek priest who refused to receive some pictures that Titian had painted for him , because they were too real : - " Your scandalous figures , " said he , " stand quite out from the canvas ; they are as bad as a group of statues . " It is a tenderness towards the idea , lest it should be dishonored by actuality . Matter is gross , obscure , evil , an obstacle to spirit , - and material existence // tolerable only as momentary , vanishing , and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicion that the Devil has a hand in it . It belongs especially to the Oriental mind , and its logical result is the Buddhist heaven of annihilation . The defect of this view is not that it is too ideal , but that it is not ideal enough . It is an incomplete idealism that through weakness of faith does not hold fast its own point of view , and so does not dispose of matter , hut leaves it outside , as negation , obstacle . The body is allowed to exist , but remains in disgrace and reduced to the barest indication . But it is honoring matter far too much to allow that it can be an obstacle . It is no obstacle , for it is nothing of itself . Rightly understood , this contempt of the body is directed only against the false emphasis placed upon single aspects or manifestations . It is a feeling that the true ideal is not thus shut up in a forced exception , as if it were the subtilized product of a distillation whereby the earthly is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-pervading reality , which the finite can neither hinder nor help , hut only obey , which death and corruption praise , which establishes itself through imperfection and transience . Gibbon , speaking of the Iconoclasts , says , - " The Olympian Jove , created by the muse of homer and the chisel of Phidias , might inspire a philosophic mind with momentary devotion ; but these Catholic images were faintly and flatly delineated by monkish artists in the last degeneracy of taste and genius . " Such comparisons mistake the point . These are not parallel attempts , but opposed from the outset . The " Catholic image " was a declaration that the problem can not be solved in that way . An early legend relates , that a painter , undertaking to copy his Christ from a statue of Jove , had his hand suddenly withered . The attempt is accused because of the pretence it makes to coordinate body and spirit , Nature and God , - as if one configuration of matter were more godlike than another . The figure of the god claims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is seen to be not merely the product of Mind working upon Matter , but the Creation of God out of nothing , - thus altogether His , in one part as much as in another . The only conceivable separateness , antagonism , is that of the sinful XYilI , setting itself up in its vanity ; this it must be that arrogates to itself the ability to represent its Creator . The Christian image is without form or comeliness , - rejects all outward graces , seemingly glories in abasement and deformity , fearing only to attribute to Matter some value of its own . Henceforth the connection is no longer at arm's-length , as of the workman and the material . Resistance to limitation is changed into joyful acceptance ; for it is not in the limitation , but in the resistance , thaf the misery of earth consists . The quarrel with imperfection is over . The finite shall neWher fortify itself in its finiteness , nor seek to abolish it , but only make it the willing instrument of universal ends . Thus the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extenuated or apologized for . The key-note of all this is contained in those verses of the " Dies Irte , " " Qunrens me sedisti lassus , Redemisti crucem p ssus ; Tantus labor non sit cassus . " Here we have in its compactest expre*-sion the difference between this age and the classic : that I ; the vilest of sinners , am the object of God 's highest care , - not the failure and mistake I seem , not the slag and refuse of Nature 's working , but the object of this most stupendous mystery of the Divine economy . It is no purification or idealizing that is needed , - any such attempt must be abomination , - but a new birth of the self , by devotion of it to the purpose for which it was made . The astounding discovery is slowly realized , and the statement of it difficult , from the need to distinguish between the // true self and the false , and to declare that this importance belongs to the individual in virtue of his spiritual nature alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his personality . What have his virtues to do with his gown and shoes ? what , indeed , with his natural disposition , as courageous , irascible , avaricious ? The difficulty is pervading , not to be avoided ; every aspect of him reveals only what is external , dies from him daily , and , if isolated , has already lost its meaninn . It is only in his work , in his connection with the world , that we see him truly . Accordingly , the statue becomes the group , and the group a member of a scries , a cycle in which each is incomplete without the r*st . The classic ideal is shivered into fragments , all to be taken together to make up the meaning . Of the hundreds of statues and reliefs that surround the great Northern cathedrals , ( Didron counts eighteen hundred upon the outside of Chartres , - nine thousand in all , carved or painted , inside and outside , ) each has its appointed place in the sacred epos in stone that unfolds about the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world from the Creation to the Judgment , and subordinated in parallel symbolism the daily life of the community , whatever occupied and interested men , - their virtues and vices , trades and recreations , the seasons*and the elements , jokes , even , and sharp hits at the great and at the clergy , scenes from popular romances , and the radicalism of Reynard the Fox , - in short , all that toiiched the mind of the age , an impartial reflex of the great drama of life , wherein all exists alike to the glory of God . It is not the glory of earth that is hero celebrated . M. Didron says the statues which the mob pulled down from the churches , at the first French Revolution , as the images of their kings , were the kings and heroes of the Old Testament . Had they known this , it might not have saved the statues , but it shows how wide a gulf separated these men from their fathers , that their hands were not held by some instinct that here was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereign importance of man , not as powerful , wise , beautiful , not in virtue of any chance advantage of birth , but in virtue of his religious nature , of the infinite possibilities he infolds . The need to indicate that the source of value is not the accident of Nature , but Nature redeemed , regenerated by spirit , that all values are moral values , led to a certain abstractness o* treatment , - on one side qualities to be embodied , on the other figures to receive them , so that the character seems adventitious , detachable , not thoroughly at one with the form . For instance , the fiends in the Orvieto Inferno are not terror embodied , as the Jove of Phidias embodied dignity and command ; but the terrific is accumulated on the outside of them , as tusks , claws , etc . One can easily believe that the ancient sculptors , had it been lawful , could have put more horror into the calm features of a Medusa than is contained in all , this apparatus and grimace . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing only for each other , is gone ; the union is occasional only , and needs to be certified and kept up afresh on every new occasion . The form must assert itself must show itself alive and quick , not the dead sign of a meaning that has fled . It would have been a poor compliment to a Greek sculptor to say that his work was life-like ; he might answer with the classically disposed visitor of the Elgin marbles in Hayden 's anecdote , - " Like life ! Well , what of that ? " lie meant it for something much better . But during the Middle Ages this is constantly the highest encomium . Amid the utmost rudeness of conception and of execution , we see the first trace of awakening Art in the unmistakable effort to indicate that the figures are alive ; and in the cathedral-scuLpture of the best time this is still a leading characteristic . Even the single statues have for their outlines curves of contrary flexure , expressing // motion ; they seem to wave in the air , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are often uncouth , but the more life-like ; a turn of the head or of the eye , a restless , unbalanced attitude , brings us nearer to the actual living creature than the magnificent repose of the antique lions and eagles , - as if they did not trust to our recognizing their character , but were prepared to demonstrate it with beak and claws . - Even in the plants , though strictly conventionalized , it is the freedom and spring of their lincs that more than anything else characterizes them and defies copying . The world of matter , being no longer endowed with independent reality , is no longer felt as a contamination incurred by the idea in its descent into existence . The discrepancy is not final , so that the supremacy of the spirit is not shown by resIstance , but by taking it to heart , carrying it out , and thereby overcoming it . In a Crucifixion of the twelfth century , Life is figured on one side crowned and victorious , and on the other Death overcome and slain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the liberation , of the infinite . But the statue remains stone ; this unmeaning emphasis of weight and bulk , though diminished , is not to be got rid of . The life that sculpture can give is superficial and abstract , does not penetrate and possess the work ; it is still the petrifaction of an instant , that does not instantly pass away , hut remains as a contradiction to the next . It is the struggle against this fixity that gives to the sculpture of the Renaissance its aspect of unrest , of disdain of the present , ofendless unsatisfied search . Hence the air of conflict that we see in Giovanni Pisano , and still more in later times ,  - -  the sculptor going to the edge of what the stone will allow , and beyond it , and , still unsatisfied , seeking through all means to indicate a yet unexecute ( l possibility . It is this that seethes in those strange , intense , unearthly figures of Donatello 's , wasted as by internal fire , - the rage for an expression that shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is done only makes the failure more evident . The fixity continues , and is only deepened into contortion and grimace . What we see is the effort alone . Hence in modern statues the uneasy , self-distrustful appeal to the spectator , in place of the lofty indifference of the antique . In Michel Angelo th same striving to indicate something in reserve , not expended , led to the exaggerated emphasis of certain parts , ( as the length of the neck , depth of the eye-sockets , etc. , ) and of general inns-. cularity , - a show of force , that gave to the Moses the build of a Titan , and to the Christ of the Last Judgment the air of a gladiator . Michel Angelo often seems immersed in mere anatomy and academic tours de Jbrce , especially in his later works . He seems to see in the subject only a fresh problem in attitude , foreshortening , muscular display , - and this not only where he invents , but also where be borrows , - sometimes most strangely overlooking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he . bor- ' rows from Orcagna and the older painters , even to the position of the arms , but with the touching gesture of reproof perverted into a savage menace ; or in the Expulsion , taken almost line for line from Masaccio , but with the infinite grief expressed in Adam 's figure turned into melodrama by showing his face . It was not for the delight of the eye , nor from over-reverence of the matter-offact . He despised the copying of models , as the makeshift of ignorance . His profound study of anatomy was not for greater accuracy of imitation , but for greater license of invention . Of grace and pleasinguess he became more and more careless , until he who at twenty had carved the lovely angel of S. , Domenico , came at last to make all his men prize-fighters and his women viragos . It is clear that we nowhere get his final meaning , - that he does not fairly . get to his theme at all , but is stopped at the // February , outset , and loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate to that " immense beauty " ever present to his mind , - so that th' matter in hand occupies him only in its superficial aspects . What he sought on all hands , in his endless questioning of the human frame , his impatience of drapery , the furious haste to reach the live surface , and the tender modulation of it when it is reached , was to make the flesh itself speak and reveal the soul present at all points alike and at once . Nothing could have satisfied him but to impart to the marble itself that omnipresence of spirit of which animal life furnishes the hint . In this Titanic attempt the means were in open and direct contradiction to the end . It was a violation of the wise moderation of Sculpture , whose rigid and colorless material pointedly declines a rivalry it could not sustain . Else why not color the stone ? The hue of flesh is the most direct assertion of life , but at the same time a direct negative to that totality and emphasis of the particular shape on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from its transparency to the circulation , - the eternal flux of matter coming to the surface in this its highest form . It is the display in matter itself of* what its true nature is , - not to resist , but to embody change , - to reduce itself to mere appearance , and be taken up without residuum in the momentary manifestation , and then at once give place to fresh manifestations . That the earlier practice of coloring statues was given up just when the need would seem to be the greatest shows its incompatibility with the fundamental conditions of the art . In the twelfth and thirteenth centuries statues were still painted and gilded . Afterwards , color is restricted to parts not directly affected by the circulation , the hair and the eyes ; and at last , when Sculpture is given over to pictorial effect and is about to yield entirely to Painting , it is wholly relinquished . Evidently it was felt that to color a statue in imitation of flesh would only enforce the fact that it is stone . What Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fife , but a unity like that which life gives , in place of the abstractness and partiality inherent in Sculpture . This makes the interest of the fact of life , - that it is the presence of the soul , - the unity established amid the sundered particularity of mi*tter . In free motion a new centre is declared , whereby the inertia of the body , its gravitation to a centre outside of it , is set aside . In sensibility this new centre declares itself supreme , superseding the passive indifference of extension . The whole pervades each part , each testifies to the whole and may stand for it . But the statue , having no such internal unity , is less able to dispense with outward completeness . All the sides must be given , so that the whole can not be seen at one view , but only successively , as an aggregate . In the earlier Greek statues the head remains lifeless , abstract , whilst the limbs are full of expression . In a contrary spirit , more akin to modern ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice of a husband from among all the gods , but having to choose by the feet alone , meaning to take Baldur , got by mistake Niordr , an inferior deity . This does not seem so strange to us ; hut a Greek would have wondered that the daughter of a wise Titan should not know the feet of Apollo from those of Nereus . It was said of Taglioni that she put mind into her legs . But to the modern way of thinking this is clearly exceptional . It is in the face , and especially in the eye , that we look to see the soul present and at work , and not merely in its effects as character . As types of character , the lineaments of the face were explored by the later Greek Art as profoundly as the rest of the body . But the statue is sightless , - its eyes do not meet ours , but seem forever brooding over a world into which the present and its interests do not enter . To the Greek this was no // defect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most vital point of all , since our conception of the soul involves its eternity , that is , that it lives always in the present , is not too fine to exist , secure that it is bound neither by past nor future , but capable of revolutionizing the character at all moments . Here is the ground of the remarkable difference that meets us already in the reliefs of the later classic times . In the reliefs of the best age the figures are always in profile and in action . Complete personification being out of the question , it is expressly avoided , - each figure waives attention to itself , merges itself in the plot . Later , when the profounder idea of a personality that does not isolate or degrade has begun to make itself felt , this constraint is given up , - the figures face the spectator , and enter as it were into relation with the actual world . The Church very early expressed this feeling of the higher significance of the head , by allowing it to be sufficient if the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is naively indicated by exaggerated size of the head and of the eyes , - a very common trait of the earlier times , and not quite obsolete at the time of the Pisani . This clumsy expedient is relinquislied , but the need it indicated continued , without the possibility of finding any complete satisfaction in Sculpture . Instead of the intensity and directness that Art now insists upon , Sculpture can give only extension and indirect hints ; instead of mind present , only its effects and products , with the working cause expressly removed . This is the ground of the seeming injustice to Sculpture at the time of the Revival . Its relative excellence was undervalued , because what it could do was not quite to the point . While the painters went on producing their antediluvian forms , the sculptors saw things much more as we do , - yet the paintings seemed the most life - like . It is astonishing , when we remember that Nicola was older than Cimabue , Giovanni than Giotto , Ghiberti than Fr*t Angelico , that the painters did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things . It is still more astonishing that it is the painters that get all the praise for accuracy . Vasari is endless in his praises of Giotto , Spinello , Stefano , ( called Scimia , or the Ape of iNature , ) and a host of others , for accurate imitation . Giovanni Villani boasts that " it is our fellow-citizen Giotto who has portrayed most naturally every form and action . " Ghiberti finishes an admring account of some paintings of Ambrogio Lorenzotto 's with the exclamation that it is truly niarvellous to think that all this is only a picture . Few pcrsons , probably , would see in the specimens of Ambrogio 's work that still remain anything wonderful for resemblance to Nature , - whilst in Ghiberti 's everybody acknowledges the astonishing truth of the detail . He tells us that he sought " to imitate Nature as far as was possible to him , " - but he seems not to be aware how much better he succeeded than the people he praises . Paolo Uccello , who was twenty years younger than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds . But one would rather undertake to paint birds as well as Paolo than to carve them as well as Ghiberti . We may learn here how little the demand to " imitate Nature " expresses what is intended . No accuracy , however demonstrable , will satisfy it . To interest me in a picture , it is not enough that something is as visible there as it is elsewhere ; it must be something that I was already striving to see . It was not a greater circumstantiality of statement than was demanded , but greater directness , - that it should be relieved of what was unessential to its purpose , tending only to obscure it . A painting , however rude , has at least this negative merit , that , by the express substitution of the appearance for the actual image , needless entanglement in the material is avoided . Weight and bulk are not indeed annihilated , but they are no longer of primary importance , and thus less obstruc // tive . The work gains precisely in what it gives up . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - by the ignoring of size the expression of size becomes possible ; a mountain , fo* iiistance , which would be an absurdity in Sculpture is representable in Painting . Thus , instead of being more abstract than Sculpture , Painting is in truth less so , since what it omits is only negative to the purpose of Art . It seems to us easier to paint than to carve , and we might expect to find Painting the older art . But the difficulty lies less in the execution than in the conception . Painting is not a tinting of surfaces , but the power to see a complex subject in unity . We may think we have no difficulty in seeing the landscape , but most persons , if called upon to state what they saw , pictorially , would show that they could not see the wood for the trees . Beginners suppose it is some knack of the * band that they are to acquire , when they learn to draw ; but that is a small part of the matter ; the great difficulty is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the parts ; but not the picture , or only vaguely . Even the degree of facility that is implied in any enjoyment of scenery is not so much a matter of course as it seems . C*sar occupied himself while crossing the Alps , with composing a grammatical treatise . There is no evidence that there was anything odd in this . Perhaps Petrarch was the first man that ever climbed a hill toenjoy the view . We are*not aware how much of what we see in Nature is due to pictures . Hardly any man is so unsophisticated , but that , if he should try to sketch a landscape , he would betray , in what he did or in what he omitted , that he saw it more or less at second-hand , through the interpretations of Art . A portfolio of Calame 's or Harding 's or Turner 's drawings will give us new eyes for the most familiar scenes . But we are aided still more by our habit of looking at things theoretically , apart from their immediate practical bearing . A savage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a picture . An Indian whom Catlin painted with half his face in shadow became the laughingstock of the tribe , as " the man with half a face . " It is not necessary to suspect Mr. Catlin 's chiaroscuro ; what puzzled them was , doubtless , the bringing together in one view what they had seen only separate . They were accustomed to see the man in light and in shadow ; but what they cared for , and therefore what they saw , was only the effect in making it more or less easy to recoguLe him and to ascertain his state of mind , intentions , etc . His face was either visible or obscured ; if they could see enough for their purpose , they regarded only that . For it to be both at once was possible only from a point of view which they had not reached . A child takes the shading of the portrait for dirt , - that being the form in which darkening of the face is familiar to him . A carved image is easier comprehended , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at on diP ferent sides , and a material connection thereby assured between the various aspects . To transfer this connection to the mind - to see varying distances in one vertical plane , so that mere gradations of light and shade shall suggest all these aspects arranged and harmonized in one view - is a farther step , and the difficulty increases with the variety embraced . Cicero was struck with this superiority in the artists of his time . " How much , " he says , " do painters see in shadow and relief that we do not see ! " Yet their perception seems strangely limited to us . The ancients had little notion of perspective . Their eyes were too sure and too well-practised to overlook the effect of position in foreshortening objects , and they were much experienced in the corrections required , and the effect of converging lines in increasing apparent distance was taken advantage of in their theatre-scenes . But they had not learned that the difference between the actual and the apparexmt form is thorough-going , so that the picture no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beholder , but imposes upon him its own point of view . It was thought remarkable in the Minerva of Fabullus , that it had the appearance of always looking at the specta*or , from whatever point it was viewed . This would be miraculous in a statue , and must seem so in the picture so long as it is looked upon only as one side of a statue . The wall-paintings of Pompeii , doubtless copies or reminiscences of Greek originals ,  --  with masterly skill in the parts , and with some success in the landscape as far as it was easily reducible to one plane , - are only collections of fragments , and show utter incapacity to see the whole at once as a picture . For instance , in one of tbe many pictures of Narcissus beholding himself in the well , the head , which is inclined sideways , instead of being simply inverted in the reflection , is reversed , - so that the chin , which is on the spectator 's left in the figure , is on the right in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way , had placed himself head downwards , and in that position had repeated the face as already painted . Such a blunder could not originate with a copyist , for it would have been much easier to copy correctly . It is clear from the general excellence of the figure that it is not the work of an inferior artist . Nor can it have come from mere carelessness ; it is too elaborate for that , - and , moreover , here is the main point of the picture , that which tells the story . Doubtless the painter had noticed the pleasingness of such reflections , as repeating the human form ; the supreme object of interest ; but the interest stopped there . He saw the face above and the face below , as he would see the different sides of a statue ; but so incapable was be of perceiving the connection and interdependence of them , that , even when Nature had made the picture for him , he could not see it . This is no isolated , casual mistake , but only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though not oien so obvious . In this and other pictures the water is like a bit of looking - glass stuck up in front , - without perspective , without connection with the ground , - the mere assertion of a reflection . The conception embraced only the main figure ; the rest was added like a label , for explanation only . These men did not see the landscape as we see it , because the interest was wanting that combines it into a picture for our eyes . Our " love of Nature would have been incomprehensible and disgusting to a Greek ; be would have called our artists " dirt-painters . " And from his point of view he would be right . Dirt it is , if we abide by the mere facts . The interest of Art lies not in the facts , but in the truth , - that is , in the facts organized , shown in their place . It is not that we care more about stocks and stones than they did , but that we hold the key to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of themselves .
