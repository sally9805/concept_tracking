Pope , from his headquarters at Milwaukee , publishes some information and suggestions for emigrants designing to cross the Plains this Spring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most powerful bands of Sioux Indians early In Spring in Missouri above the mouth of Grand River . A large force of cavalry , under Gen , SULLY , will march against these Indians as soon as there is grass enough on the prairies for the horses to subsist on . Until this expedition moves it will be unsafe for steamersto navigate the Missouri above Fort Pierre . Gen. SULLY 'S force will be strong enough to beat the Indians , if found concentrated on the river . If this concentration is not made , a heavy force of cavalry will scour the country on both sides of the river , drive the Indians into the interior , pursue them during the Summer , and either force a battle or compel a peace . It is recommended that emigrants by water communicate with Gen. Sum , in upper Missouri , and not attempt to pass in advance of his forces , until notified by him that it is safe . As many steamers as possible are advised to go in company , with their vulnerable parts bullet-proof . Emigrants traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start from the Missouti River in numbers less than 300 strong . A cavalry force will be sent from Minnesota as soon as possible to the mouth of Long Lake , and emigrants from that State can avail themselves of the protection of this force if they choose . Gen. Porn hopes by the midale of Summer to render travel across any portion of the Upper Plains as safe as it usually is ; but he enjoins on the emigrants to move cautiously and in strong parties . Mr. Chase and the Presidency . The following is the letter to which Mr. CitAsE refers in that which we have already published declining to permit his name to be used in connection with the Presidential nomination : WASHINGTON , Jan. 18 , 1864 . My DEAR SIR ; Your kind note is just received . As it has been so long on the way , I have telegraphed you that I will reply by mail . At the instance of manywho think that the public interests would be promoted by my election to the Chief Magistracy , a committee composed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here for taking measures to promote that object . This committee , through a sob-committee , has conferred with me , and I have explained to them the objections which seem to me to exist against any use of my name in that oonnection . They have taken these objections into consideration , and assure me that they think I ought not to refuse its use . and I have consented to their wishes ; assuring them , however , that whenever any consideration by them or by the friends of our cause , thought entitled to weight , should indicate the expediency of any other course , no considerations of personal delicacy toward me should be allowed to prevent its being taken . If I know my own heart , I desire nothing so much as the suppression of this rebel ion , and the reestablishment of Union , order and prosperity on sure and safe foundations . And I should despise myself If I felt capable of allowing any personal objects to influence me to any action which would affect by one jot or tittle , injuriously , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of real gratification to believe that those who desire my nomination desire it on public grounds alone , and will not hesitate to act , in any matter which may concern me , upon such grounds , and such grounds only . Of course , under these circumstances , I desire the support of Ohio . If , however , it shall be the pleasure of a majority of our friends in Ohio to indicate a preference for another , I shall accept their action with that cheerful acquiescence which is due from me to friends who have trusted and honored me beyond any claim or merit of mine .
