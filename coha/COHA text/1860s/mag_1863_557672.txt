" Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1863 . THOSE who have been close students of outward nature , the naturalists , the hunters , the poets , the astronomers , the " Lone readers of the woods , the waters , and the skies , " have been amply repaid for their labors by the intimate knowledge they have gained of all things in that outer world . Their writings are fresh with discoveries , suggestions , inferences ; they speak of what they alone know ; and they command attention . To this cause , Cooper , and Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; to this , Wordsworth is indebted for his position as the father of modern poetry ; by this , Humboldt and Agassiz hold their rank as naturalists . It is very true that , if we wish to win a secret , we must make an effort , and no more true in outward nature than in the hidden life of every man . They who listen to the beating of their own hearts , who question actions and thoughts , who sound the depths of their inward being , gain a knowledge which throws upon many a dark problem in human nature the light of spiritual truth . If this introspective study does not degenerate into sentimental feeling , but is carried on by sound healthy thought , it brings to knowledge new facts ; it reveals in our minds to a great extent the working of other minds ; one person becomes the microcosm of humanity . Hence the value of these meditations ; they are not to be set aside as idle dreams , but esteemed as contributions to the yet unwritten philosophy of human life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly prized , yet rather by a sect than by the world at large . They are generally personal revelations , the confessions of some lone spirit who , in default of friends , has begged the great world // to listen . But they often cut the knot of questions which have been asked for centuries , simply because they disclose some new fact or some fresh application of a known truth . They are the writings which descend by degrees into the common currency of thought , and give it depth and life . To this class of books we are glad to add the volumes named at the head of this article , - " Two Friends , " " The Patience of Hope , " and " A Present Heaven . " They were written by Miss Dora Greenwell , a native of England , and a communicant of the English Church . She has also published a volume of poetry which has not yet been reprinted here , but which , if we may judge from the extracts we have seen , differs from her prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a certain masculine freedom of expression , in a style at once strong , clear , and poetic , without much logical sequence , but yet with a firm , nervous grasp of thought . She so states her views that they seem to be intuitively true ; they do not need argument ; they require meditation ; they appeal to your thoughtful experience ; they demand the still hour , the quiet , trustful heart , the sympathy of a warm religious faith ; and when read in this spirit , they unfold an unusual richness of thought and experience . She is familiar with the best things in literature , has a highly cultivated mind , and yet she does not travel at all in hackneyed paths . She has marked out an original course of thought . Her writings have a strong , yet genial personality . They are distinct from whatever has been heretofore written upon these topics . Hence their value is the greater , as the unmistakable testimony of an original mind . We should think the writer had been much alone , working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which beset her own life in silence and in familiar study of the Book of books . It would be difficult to find in all the current writings of women any work which can compare with these little volumes in respect of subtile , fine , spiritual thought . Such books are always the fruit of a meditative life . They grow , like plants , by inward forces unseen by the eye , unheard by the ear . What , then , is their subject ? It is no easy question to answer . They are all meditations upon the solemn , spiritual realities of life . They deal familiarly with topics which are // seldom spoken of even among intimate friends , but which are ever haunting our thoughtful hours . The religions life is the grand theme ; and the treatment is easy and episodical , like conversation . He who looks into them for the commonplaces of religious writing will find nothing to his taste . They are not mawkish , nor sentimental , but strong and deep and quiet . They breathe freely the thoughts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar . The Christian life , the daily teaching of personal experience , the power and weakness of Christianity , its special application to our own time , the peculiar work of the Holy Spirit , are all treated with fulness , point , and originality . We turn now to the special examination of the books themselves . The " Two Friends " is made up apparently from the conversations of two friends upon a variety of religious topics . This is a popular yet ancient way of bringing together disjointed fragments of thought . It allows the freedom of saying what you please ; it removes the stiffness of professed bookmaking . The friends are the author and Philip , who appears as the rector of an English parish church . The book is prefaced by a curious and needlessly involved allegory of human life . The writer wanders by a stream which flows out into the great ocean . The stream is the world , growing more confused and unsteady , as we embark more entirely upon it ; but followed np to its source , a babbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to come from God alone . The writer is guided in her allegory by the teachings of an ancient book ; and in the mountains whence the stream issues she meets Him of whom the ancient book speaks . He unfolds to her the secrets and the meaning of life . The teaching of the allegory seems to consist of the experiences of one who wanders away from God , and yet turns back to him as the only safe guide into all truth . It thus embraces the whole cycle of experience through which any one mind may pass . Philip enters upon the scene at the close of the allegory . Peace had come to the writer 's heart . She had passed over the threshold of a new existence . She says of this change - " There arc some days , even moments , in our lives , *tpon wldck the // l*itrden of the whole seems laid , which , as in a parable , condense within them the mystery , the contradiction of our existence , and perhaps hint at its solution . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These seasons are set apart from the rest by a solemn consecration . We feel that we are anointed above our fellows ' ; it may be for the joy of the bridal , for the wrestler 's struggle , or against the day of our burial , we know not which . " - pp. 25 , 26 . Each had freely used the ancient book ; each had that diverse experience which drew each to the other ; and when they met , " the dying light , the faint shiver of the leaves above us , the mystery , the solitude that enclosed us , - all seemed to exalt , to deepen our converse , to shorten our way into each other 's hearts , by removing all that ofttimes drops like a veil between soul and soul , changing us from our truer , better selves in an evil transfiguration . " The passages which describe the effect of the interview upon the writer 's mind are chastely beautiful in thought and expression . And the character of Philip is drawn by no unloving band . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conception of spiritual manhood as woman ever gave shape to , - a strong , self-centred nature , dependent in the highest things , a lover of truth , a firm , faithful Christian thinker and worker . " His spirit was that of one to whom the day of life , from dawn to dusk , was emphatically the Day after which the Night cometh , wherein no man can work ; and yet there was in him II know not what sweetness and candor of nature , that saved him from the narrowness that so often marks the compact , established mind . " A delightful character , sunny , genial , manly , and , if somewhat ideal , yet none the less useful . The portrait here so lovingly painted lends a charm and confidence to all the discussions in the little volume . These discussions so vary , as the conversation winds in and out of great spiritual truths , that our only resort , to give any adequate idea of the topics discussed , is quotation . Philip and the author are one so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presents different sides of the same subject . There is all the life of real dialogue . It is not the paragraphs of a book distributed to wooden actors . Philip , if entirely a creation of the brain , holds his own individuality admirably well ; if , as is // most likely , he has the lineaments of an intimate friend , he endears himself in these pages to every reader . He gives this simple and beautiful thought on the usefulness of the Ideal , as follows - " There is a region within him man in which she also serves , and serves no less truly because her action is , like all spiritual forces , irre - ular and intermittent , - an influence which comes unwooed , and departs unbidden , no more to be trained and disciplined than the lightning can be steadied into the fire of a household hearth , to live by and cook by . I have long loved art and poetry , because I saw that they had a power to raise and soften Humanity. ; more lately I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence , but from their native affinity with the things that are more excellemit , should come this acknowledged power ? " - p.38 . The same thought is further developed with reference to the future life : - " Man , it is evident , even in that part of him which is sensitive , is forever touching upon a system of things upon which , under the present conditions of his being , he can not fully enter . There is within him an enchanted land of mystery and beauty , a land where all slumbers , until some outward shock , like the kiss of the Fairy Prince , comes to awake it from sleep . So , in that part of our nature which is spiritual , there is a region into which man can not ascend until he is lifted there by God through that supernatural action upon the soul which we call grace ; the voice of the Divine Spirit wakening up the human spirit to its true life . " And hence the connection of Christianity with poetry , music , nature , with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These are helps , lfts to the soul ; and people feel better , more able to believe , to love , to pray , when the finer springs of existence have been touched through any of these . Genius , like Christianity , sees all things in their mutual relation ; its tendency is to throw the many-chambered mansions of the soul into one . The simplest song , where its breath is felt , stirs something which goes through the whole . Is there not a delight* , almost a religious pleasure , in a work of true imaginative genius ? a delight kindred to that . which is derived from the contemplation of nature , - the delight of being carried out of one 's self into something greater and truer than self because more universal . It often seems to me that Imagination is the highest faculty of man . It starts , as Faith does , from a higher level than any of his other powers , and on that level meets and familiarly accosts truths which reason must struggle up // to . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , left to itself it could never either have foreseen the glorious end , nor even the way that led to it . " - pp. 46 - 48 . There is ever , in all these volumes , this blending of fine thought with spiritual truth . The writer sees things from a high point of view . She has the insight of the poet , - that finely imaginative faculty which lends a precious seeing to the mind 's eye . Her thoughts are so expressed that they at once engage the attention of cultivated readers . She passes beyond the limits of the mere religionist to a perfectness , a literary finish , which attracts even the irreligious mind . Here is a thought which we have never seen more truly expressed : - " It is among the ignorant , the out-of-the-way , the commonplace , that the Christian 's daily lot is thrown , and their daily appeals are to him as sacred as those which come more seldom , and with a louder knocking at the gate . That Christianity should so fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a proof of its crowning excellence . A little child shall lead them , ' this , it seems to me , is the pass.word into this kingdom of greatness and simplicity . All other ideals draw away the heart from real life ; the poet , the artist , is continually trying to break out of the narrow circle of visible things ; he asks for better bread than can be made with wheat . ' The Christian ideal alone meets the habitual , the practical , - meets it while immeasurably transcending it , - embraces it , and walks with it hand in hand . " - pp. 57 , 58 . Miss Greenwell has scattered along these pages many hints and suggestions , each of which would furnish materials for a volume . She has glanced keenly into the religious motives and life of the present day . In the following sentences she says what many have felt : - " In all that concerns Christianity under its present dispensation , we must be prepared to meet with a certain degree of check and disappointment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaust the soil that rears it , so that Christianity must always gain much from extraneous sources . It does so , in our own day , from science and general social progress . These are its friends , though sometimes disguised ones ; and Christ still gathers where he did not straw , and reaps where he did not sow . " - p. 149. // " There is something in Christianity , if we examine its history closely , which always for its full development requires an inner circle , a church within the church . " - p. 104 . These sentences put into words the silent , unventured convictions of many minds . They reach down to that undercurrent of thought and feeling which flows beneath outward and familiar things . They speak the language of the spiritual life . The " Two Friends " abounds in thoughts which are more rarely spoken than felt . The author 's point of view is not only religious , but philosophic . Hence there is a broadness and catholicity which seldom enter into merely religious writings ; hence she addresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these volumes have a special attraction to literary men . They speak to those who have a finely cultivated sense of religious truth , to those whom sermons do not often hit , to those who are often led to pay too much deference to taste or to the demands of a strong intellect . They unite fine social and mental culture with a rich spiritual insight . " The Patience of Hope " and " A Present Heaven " strike a deeper vein than the " Two Friends . " They are more theological , and yet they contain , not the dry bones , but the marrow , of theology . " The Patience of Hope " might perhaps be called Meditations upon Christ and his work in the individual heart . Our union with him , the temptations and departures of a religious life , the many-sided lights of the world let in upon religions truth , the strength of the spiritual man , the changefulness of godly experiences , the many glimpses of " thoughts that wander through eternity , " are discoursed upon with loving fondness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pure ; the tone of the whole book is such that one instinctively makes it the companion of his private hours . The reserve of religious experience is taken away ; it is the answer of heart to heart ; all is laid bare . Here are some quotations which show its strata - " There is much even in the renewed mind which , if suffered to remain there , would gradually eat away the heart of its strength and purity ; something in each believer , which he imagined he had left behind when he forsook all and gave himself up to follow Christ , but he finds that it has rushed after him , like Care in the ancient proverb , and holds to him with as tight a grasp as ever . " - p. 140. // " With regard to many of the truths of Christ , we are surely learning to he no more children , ever looking at things in part , ' hut men , able to appreciate them as they bear upon each other , and upon the facts with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is there not something in the very nature of spiritual Truth which demands for its reception more than the mere intellect , let it strive as it will , can compass , and something , too , in our own nature which makes us , as responsible beings , answerable for what , as regards this Divine truth , we see and hear ? To put this in other words , Can a spiritual truth be apprehended otherwise than sacramentally ? " - p. 106 . We might continue these qnotations ; hut enough have been given to show the spirit of the author . She is alive to every influence which affects the religious life ; her writings abound in seminal truths ; she strikes directly at the root of things . The " Present Heaven " has a higher character than either of the other volumes . It is a treatise upon the office arid work of the Holy Spirit , - a living treatment of the subject , " Christ the power of God , and the wisdom of God . " It is divided into five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Gospel received flistorically , the Gospel received Prophetically , the Gospel received implicitly . It opens finely - " Every ama that conieth to God , darkly as he may feel after , and imperfectly as he may find Him , comes to 1-Jim under the twofold conviction upon which the Apostle bases the existence of Faith itself ; he must be persuaded that God is , and that He is the rewarder of such as diligently seek him . ' " - p. 1 . Beginning thus strongly , the author goes on to show the different degrees of Christian belief , and their several effect upon personal character . There is here less of episode ; the subject draws the writer up to its own sublime heights . And* her mind has received such a strong nurture from a hearty study of the Scriptures , a catholic study of church symbols , and a genial acquaintance with literature and art , that she is entitled to speak with some degree of authority . Her familiar expositions of the working of Divine grace will touch the experience of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The greater part of this volume is grouped about a passage from Newton , which she quotes in a note , and which is really the centre to which all her thoughts converge : // " iReligion stands upon two pillars , namely , what Christ did for us in His flesh , and what He performs in us by His Spirit . Most errors arise from an attempt to separate these two . " It is an illuminating commentary upon the more mystical and profound parts of St. Paul 's Epistles . It is peculiarly fitted to be the companion of a religious mind . The author lives so deeply and familiarly in the atmosphere of spiritual things , that the influence of these writings is at once stimulating and refreshing to the soul . They come from the heart ; they return thither . To those who live in the deeper , holier realities of their faith , they must be unspeakably precious . They are a living voice of cheer in a dreary land . They assure us that in an age when the greater number show a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortality of the soul , there are yet " some who live in the faith of an intimate communion between God and man . " Such , then , is a partial , cursory statement of what these volumes contain . It is impossible to classify or epitomize the thought . It must be taken all together , or not at all . But enough has been quoted and said to show that they are a remarkable contribution to our higher literature . If they needed an authoritative introduction to us , Mr. Whittier has admirably performed that service in the delicate and appreciative pages which preface " The Patience of Hope . " But such books make their own way in the world . They have an inherent worth which cultivated minds are not slow to find out . We have no hesitation in calling Miss Greenwell the Thomas is Kempis of the nineteenth century . She has written so entirely to the condition of all devout minds , that her " Present Heaven " will no doubt take the position in this century which the De linitatione Citristi did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manual of the religious life . And what is true of this volume is also true in a great measure of the others . They are all mystical writings ; but there is nothing ascetic in them , nothing morbid . They are so thoroughly seasoned with the New Testament , so thickly sown with Scripture quotations , so informed with the best culture of the age , that the tendency is not so strong as in kindred writings of former // days to build up an intricate fabric of spiritual truth . They are at once Protestant in the openness and freedom of their corninents , and Catholic iu the correct presentation of the Christian life . Their great defect is the defect of all mystical writings , - the slight value attached to outward life and positive institutions and ordinances . But even here they are a vast improvement on Thomas * Kempis and the Theologia Gerrnantca . These books are self-destructive , - they teach self-sacrifice , seclusion , renunciation , self-loss ; but Miss Greenwell never forsakes the plain , homely highway of the religious life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An unlettered Christian can understand her , and the philosopher can do no more . Much of this universality of adaptation is due to her literalness . She is always couching her sayings in some Bible phrase , as clear and weighty as Anglo-Saxon can make it . She has the literalness of St. Bernard , with the depth , the incisiveness , of Pascal . The " Present Heaven " is far more practical than theoretical . It is tangible ; it finds out the reader 's own thought ; it raises him to its own high spiritual level . And this can not always be said of the old mystics . In their attempt to escape from the intense ecclesiasticistn of the age , they shut themselves up like oysters in the shell of their own self ; and there they tried to heal spiritual diseases by steadfastly looking into their own hearts , when they might have found the true remedy in the Latin Vulgate . But here the English Bible , and the social and widely separated intellectual movements of the day , have imparted to mysticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within convent walls . In the old sense , it is not mysticism : it is mysticism breathed upon by the nineteenth century . Accordingly , these books have an important bearing upon the religious questions of the day . They are the testimony of a hitherto silent but catholic mind to the old beliefs . With unerring insight she sees where we are at fault . And she speaks with authority to tl1at large class of literary men who have divorced the intellect from a living faith in Christianity . Let us hear her words : - " We are met , comparatively speaking , by little direct opposition to revealed religion ; its moral teaching is respected ; the sacred person // of its Founder is held in reverence ; it is as a power that Christianity is denied . Our age has nothing in common with the degrading scepticism of the past century , which casts its scorn up to God through the foul dishonoring of His image . We believe , as I have said , in Man ; and our noble and tender faith in Humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persevering and arduous efforts after social amelioration The prophets who come in their own name , the apostles of human development , of social progress , find a willing hearing ; but where is our recognition of a divinely appointed agency here is our faith in that which bath appeared to man ? " - The Patience of Hope . pp. 78 , 79 . " The lightest leaf will show the way the wind is setting , and I know not where we are met by a plainer expression of this tacit , and in some degree respectful denial , than in the popular literature of the day . Here we see a systematic ignoring of Christianity , combined with a rather inconsistent exaltation of the benevolent aspect peculiarly belonging to it . We find in such writings many flowers to please us , but see that , as in a child 's garden , they are stuck into the ground by their stalks only , and have not grown where we now see them . " - Ibid. , p. 78 , note . Literature and art , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a charm of their own , and needed not any other , - now breathe and burn in the fulness of a parasitical life ; the fever of* man 's conflict has passed across them ; their bloom and fragrance feeds and Is fed by fire kindled far down at the central heart . " - ibid. , p. 100 . " To know more of ourselves , and to know meanwhile no more of God , makes our present anguish and desolation . But what if even here were our safety ? What if it were through this very wound that the good Samaritan as he journeys designs to pour in the wine and oil of his consolation ? What if ; in learning more of the awful and tender mystery of our own nature , we become acquainted with the yet more awful , more tender mystery that encompasses it ? " - ibid. , p. 101 . " My intimate conviction Fis that we shall find , so we do but pierce deep enough , that inward decay and outward disorder - all things which , whether in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and defile - hold by one common root , - Unbelief in God 's Word and in His Work . " - A Present Heaven , p. 18 . " It sometimes seems to me that we are on the verge of a great constructive era . Men are beginning to repair the old wastes , the desolations of many generations . The Critical is now having its day ; we may compare its work to that clearing away , which is the first sign of improve // ment ; but its day must pass , as nothing of a simply negative kind can be lasting . Then comes a glad rebuilding , of which I can but prophesy dimly ; but I foresee that the persoa and work of Christ will be its centre . And He , when he is lifted up , will draw all men unto him . - Two Friends , pp. 87 , 88 . " It seems to me that in no other age of the world has the attraction of the Cross been so deeply felt as it is in this , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is now to explain the dark parables of nature ; the grievous contradictions of life . " - ibid. , p. 16* . Here are clearly indicated in broad outline the causes and the cure of our present religious disorders . The humanitarian literature of the day is feverish and untrue to nature . The free streagth of a sound Christian manhood is sadly wanting among popular literary men . But no literature can retain a permanent hold unless its foundation be laid in Christ . A literature of unbelieving men is at once vapid and uncertain ; it is not strong and healthy . Shelley and Byron had not even a parasitical attachment to Christianity ; and their poetry , while passionately beautiful , does not ring with true and earnest feeling . But when a man believes earnestly , and has a heart at rest , he is prepared to think at least with a sane mind ; and if he be rooted in the Christian faith , though he never so much as alludes to it openly , yet the feeling , the atmosphere of faith and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is quite as important to breathe good air as to eat good food . How many men have stifled genius by low associations , giving to impurity what was meant for the service of God ! How many books exhale all their goodness ( if they ever had any ) before the ink dries upon their pages ! The strength , the power , the life , of the intellect flows through the heart ; and if the heart be turned away from a deep and vital faith in Christ , the mind is feeble and dry and juiceless ; it spends its strength upon trifles ; it never attains to the full expansion of its powers . Miss Greenwell has written wise words for literary men . If any delineation of the Chris tian life can have an attraction for the cultivated thinker , he will surely find it in these pages . Nor does she despair of the common faith while her own communion is rocked to and fro by the upbeaval of old beliefs . // 1863 . QUIETISM IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the discussion of the inspired character of God 's Word , she has perhaps touched upon the real state of the case better than any one else . She says : " Revelation is the coming forth of the Father to meet His Son , while He is a great way off ; it is as the Spirit of God moving upon the darkened surface of man 's heart and intellect , and saying , Let there be light . ' " There is real joyfulness in her assurance that the old truths shall yet prevail . She sees all sides of our present unbelief , and with a loving hand she applies the balm of healing . We may all take courage when a spiritual Joan of Arc opens the way to escape from the sorest enemies , - unbelief and doubt and a dead faith . So true it is that , after we have spent half our days amid the distractions of religious discussion , and gone the whole round of religions experiences , the few sharp , intuitive strokes of woman 's logic clear away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troubled heart . Miss Greenwell is not the only writer who in these days has entered within the veil of spiritual truths . Whatever may be the case with popular writers , a portion of our literature partakes largely of this religious element . And this to many is the only redeeming feature in it . The influence of Wordsworth - his lofty and devout spirituality - has given tone and depth to many minds . It is seen , for instance , in Tennyson 's I* lliemoriam , - perhaps the most purely religious poem of the age . Roscoe and Sterling and Vaughan - all now gone to their rest - gave their best thoughts to this kind of literary effort . Carlyle has all the mystic fervor , but none of the quiet self-loss , of the older writers . He inclines largely to German mysticism , which is mostly too obscure , too intangible , for the common understanding . Robert Browning is a genuine mystic ; his thoughts run deep , yet too much in by-paths to give him a wide popularity . But Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the simplicity of his piety and the manly strength of a Christian understanding . His biography is the companion volume to the Present Heaven. ** The lyric poetry of the day has also a finely mystical element . It is not all sad , nor all joyous . The sunlight of a warm religious faith shines through it . Miss Waring , in the // Hymns and Meditations , has struck a tender , delicate , yet truly simple vein of religious feeling . Mrs. Stowe 's poems reflect a loving and devout spirituality . Jones Very has always piped the sweet , sad notes of religious melancholy . Dana writes with a wise , strong spiritual energy . The author of " NightWatches " has breathed out , in poetry beautiful and soothing , the sick-room meditations of a Christ-like spirit . Harriet McEwen Kimball and Mary Clemmer Ames - each as yet unbooked in song - have both published poems which are kindred in depth and in Christian joyousness to the writings of Miss Greenwell , - full of rest and peace and hope . The later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far into the future life . They penetrate within the veil . This lyric poetry is all freighted with rich , tender , and vital Christian experience . Croswell and Keble and Coxe , and the numberless writers of one good hymn , all belong to the same blessed fellowship . The collections of pious lyrics from the Ancient Greek Fathers , from the iloman Breviary and Missal , from the German mystics , from the older English poets , are daily growing more popular with devout minds . The Lyre Gollectanec* are in every library . May not this demand be taken as a sign of the return of many to the old and simple ways of religious devotion ,  --  to the great catholic truths which underlie , and give strength to , religious lyric poetry ? And may we not note another joyful sign in these very mystical writings which find so warm a reception among religions persons ? May we not gather hope for the future from the fact that our Quietistic literature is so largely informed by the spirit and teachings of Christ ? Our mystical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moulds of thought , but rather to drink in inspiration by a devout study of the Divine Word ; and if they draw more meaning out of certain passages than the less intuitive mind can decipher , it does no harm ; and they may be right . No mind can see all sides of any one truth ; and it is almost certain that a writer of clear spiritual insight will discover many hidden gems . It is safer to follow the mystic , especially the mystic of our own day , than the hardened theologian . He has the essence of truth , if not its shell . We thankfully accept these little volumes , then , as a most // 401 valuable contribution to our Christian mystical literature , as a thoughtful solution of many religious problems , as a wise anfolding of the depths of religious consciousness , as a manual of holy living and holy dying which both literary and working men will find to contain the right word in the right place for each and all . They speak tender sympathy to the afflicted they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green pastures of God 's love ; they give the soul peace and rest . This Vesper Hymn , the only one of Miss Greenwell 's poems for which we have room , " beautiful in its Christian humility and self-abnegation , " breathes the very spirit and tone and life of all her writings : - " When I have said my quiet say , When I have sung my little song , How sweet , methought , shall die the day The valley and the hill along ! How sweet the summons , Come away ! That calls me from the busy throno ! " I thought beside the water 's how Awhile to lie beneath the leaves I thought in autumn 's harvest glow To rest my head upon the sheaves . But lo ! methinks the day is brief And cloudy ; flower , nor fruit , nor leaf ; I bring , and yet , accepted , free , And blest , my Lord , I come to Thee !
