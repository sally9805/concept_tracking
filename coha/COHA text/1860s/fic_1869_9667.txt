MORGAN reading ; CHARLES reading ; EDWARD and ALFRED playing chess ; DAVID and GODFREY playing backgammon ; ISAAC and MARK writing . CHARLES  --  ( looking up from his book. )  --  I should like to be a great author ! MR . MORGAN .  --  What has inspired you with that desire so suddenly ? CHARLES .  --  Reading Milton at this moment , Macaulay yesterday , and Dickens perhaps to-morrow . Is it not a great gift , that by the written thought issuing from one man 's pen , thousands may be instructed , pleased , perhaps led from vice to virtue , from sin to God ? MR . MORGAN .  --  It is indeed a noble profession , when taken up in the spirit which you describe , Charles . Not adopted merely for money or fame , but with the sincere desire to ennoble your fellow-men , diffuse knowledge and lead to Christianity . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLES .  --  I know that , sir . But I will study hard to gain knowledge now , that when I take up my pen in future , I may rank as a great author . EDWARD .  --  And I shall study hard too , Charles , to do for men 's bodies what you purpose to do for their minds . MR . MORGAN .  --  You will be a doctor , Edward ? EDWARD .  --  That is my great desire , sir . I would be a famous physician , such as now stand for authorities at the head of their profession . MR . MORGAN .  --  You must be a close student , to realize that dream . EDWARD .  --  True . I would study Science in her highest branches , and then seek out practical uses for my knowledge . A doctor has a grand work before him . MR . MORGAN .  --  The power of alleviating or preventing suffering is certainly one of the noblest gifts given to man . And no man has such power so completely within his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I would be no hermit , to shut myself within four walls for the purpose of crowding my own brains with knowledge , but in the hospitals , among the poor , wherever misery could be relieved , pain conquered , disease baffled , there I would make my study , till I had the science at my own command . And then , Charlie , my hands against your pen , in the work of benefiting mankind . ALFRED .  --  I will be a sailor ! CHARLES .  --  You , Al ! I thought you were to be Edward 's rival in the medical profession ? ALFRED .  --  So they say at home , but the student 's life has no charm for me . I would lead an active life , wrestle with the elements , dare the storm in its fury , court the breeze in its mild humor , till I had steered my vessel safely from port to port , bearing the spices of the East , the furs of the North , the jewels of the South , to trade for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man-of-war , do battle for my country 's flag , and place my name upon the roll of honor , now blazoned in our navy . FRANK .  --  I aspire to becoming an inventor . MR . MORGAN .  --  Of what ? FRANK .  --  Something in the way of a magnetic telegraph , or an iron-clad , sir . All laugh . I am content to commence in an humble way , and take my position as apprentice in a machine shop . I will learn to file a hammer and bore ; will study mechanical drawing , will master civil engineering , until from a workman , I rise to a higher position , master of my trade , knowing the relative powers of material and force , and when my name appears on a patent as important as the locomotive or sewing machine , you fellows will all laugh on the other side of your mouth ! Then Charles may write verses to my honor , Alfred may carry my fame abroad  --  CHARLES .  --  And Edward patch up your worn-out brains and body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Law is the lever by which crime is  --  CHARLES .  --  Elevated to the gallows . DAVID .  --  You shut up , you 've had your say . You have spoiled one of the most eloquent defences of the law , ever spoken outside of a court-room . Perhaps it is just as well , for I can never realize my wish . MR . MORGAN .  --  Why not , David ? DAVID .  --  Father is going to teach me his trade , sir , and expects me to go into his store . EDWARD .  --  What is his trade ? DAVID .  --  Shoemaking ! CHARLES .  --  " Oh , what a fall was there , my countrymen ! " DAVID .  --  From the judge 's wig , to his honor 's boots ! Well , he shall have good boots if I make them , anyhow . MR . MORGAN .  --  That 's the right spirit , David . If you are obeying your father , and performing faithfully the duty appointed for you , you will be as happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge 's . DAVID .  --  What shall you be , Godfrey ? GODFREY .  --  A merchant . I shall charter Alfred 's vessel , and many more , to send to every known port , to collect wares for my stores . I shall open paths of employment for hundreds of my fellow-men . Sailors shall man my vessels , clerks fill my counting-houses , salesmen my stores . My wealth shall find a thousand avenues to benefit others , while enriching myself . MR . MORGAN .  --  An honest , liberal merchant , may do all this , Godfrey ; yet watch carefully , lest the love of amassing wealth contract your philanthropy , till it becomes avarice . ISAAC .  --  I will be a traveler . I will explore the burning plains of Africa , and the frozen paths of the Arctic regions , the deserts of the East , the prairies of the West , will cross the trackless ocean , and journey over the land , culling from every clime her hidden treasures of knowledge . My books shall rival those Edward writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My pen shall print for others what my eyes find worthy of record , and I will place my name among the great explorers . CHARLES .  --  Unless you are eaten up by some of the lions of Africa . DAVID .  --  Or the Polar bears . ALFRED .  --  Captured by the Arabs . GODFREY .  --  Or scalped by the Indians . ISAAC .  --  Bah ! Every life has its dangers . Why do you not threaten Charles with a brain fever , Edward with the small-pox , Alfred with drowning , and Frank with mutilation ? MR . MORGAN .  --  Your defence is just , Isaac . Every profession has its dangers , and a coward would shirk all . But what will our quiet little Mark be ? MARK .  --  A missionary , sir . MR . MORGAN .  --  A noble life , Mark . MARK .  --  I trust to be allowed to realize my wish , sir . My father is willing for me to study for the ministry . And when I am ready , all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  How , Mark ? MARK .  --  Isaac shall tell me where in his travels he finds the greatest need of my services . ISAAC .  --  I 'll hunt up heathens for you , never fear . MARK .  --  Godfrey shall lend me a berth in one of his vessels , to carry me to my destination . GODFREY .  --  It shall be fitted up like a parlor for you . MARK .  --  Alfred shall steer my ship across the ocean . ALFRED .  --  That I will , heartily . MARK .  --  Frank shall aid me in imparting the mysteries of mechanics to my scholars . FRANK .  --  I 'll invent machines for their special benefit . MARK .  --  Edward shall pack my medicine chest . CHARLES .  --  I will write your fame ! DAVID .  --  And I will make your boots ! MR . MORGAN .  --  It gives me great pleasure , dear boys , to find that you all seek to benefit others , not attain merely your own selfish ends . The man who makes wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he works , will arrive at his journey 's end with a sordid and hardened heart . But he who , in his daily routine of duty , will watch for the opportunity of aiding others , elevating his fellow-men , and doing good , whether he be poet or merchant , doctor or mechanic , shoemaker or traveller , lawyer or missionary , must become respected and beloved , and carry a clear conscience and happy heart . Curtain falls .
