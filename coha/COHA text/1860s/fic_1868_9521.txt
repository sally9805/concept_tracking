Devil . Sam Switchell Yes , a real genuine Yankee devil , or a devil of a Yankee ; you may have me either way by paying the discount .

Some of them have gone to ' tend on the House of Lords , and some of them have gone down into Russia to keep an eye upon the Emperor , and others are gone to trade , that is , to swap and bargain with the missionary preachers ; that 's easily done . Them fellows are like a rat with your foot upon his tail , he 'll skin and cut , and clear out when he 's hard run .

Sam Switchell Why , that 's according to the quantity of wood he take . If he belongs to the temperance society , we put a devil to every two , and plenty of Newcastle coal ; but if he 's a real double distilled swell head , he 'll burn a fortnight without any fuel , and can take care of himself . After that , we keep him for a torch , to hang in the hall . You 'd do for a patent chandelier . Bone . Bone Squash Oh , de debbil ! Bone Squash , de patent sweeper , transmogrified into a patent chandelier . How de niggers would laugh if dey was to hear dat . Devil . Sam Switchell Come , what do you say , you brick dust ?

Bone Squash Look a here , Mr. Yankee Debbil ; I 'm no common nigger what you meets wid round de markets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what libs by de sweat ob de chin , as de poet says ; and if you buy me , you must just crowd steam and come up to de landing , pretty saucy . You see , honey , I 'm a free nigger . Crosses , l. h . Devil . Sam Switchell What ! a free nigger ? Well , let 's see you move . Bone crosses to r. h .

" I patronize dat paper for ' ticular reasons ; it ' seminates de useful knowledge to de gubernal branches ob de community . Dat 's de " New York Mirror ; " you may hab dat . I only takes dat paper out ob compliment to de ladies . Devil Sam Switchell Dips his tail into blacking , and writes . Can you write ? Bone . Bone Squash Yes , and cipher too . Devil .

I want de real buttons . Is n't you got any ob de hard cash ? Come , dump up . Devil . Sam Switchell Why , I tell you it will pass on ' change like an omnibus . They all know me ; I 've dealings with all of them . Mention my name , and any of ' em will take old Nick 's check in less time than you 'd light a match . Bone .
