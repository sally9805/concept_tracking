ART . DJ . - CIVIL-SERVICE REFORM . " IN the government of this Commonwealth , the legislative department shall never exercise the executive and judicial powers , or either of them ; the executive shall never exercise the legislative and judicial powers , or either of them ; the judicial shall never exercise the legislative and executive powers , or either of them : to the end it may be a government of laws and not of men . " The Massachusetts Bill of Rights , which contains this article , inimitable for grasp and conciseness , adds elsewhere the warning that among the precautions absolutely necessary for the maintenance of a free government is a frequent recurrence to the fundamental principles of the Constitution . Laying aside , therefore , the usual arguments in favor of civilservice reform , - arguments drawn from finance or from administrative convenience , - this essay will attempt to show that the soundness and vigor , nay , even the purpose of the reform movement , must depend upon its recurrence to the fundamental principles of the Constitution . When President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands a greater power than any President chosen for many years past or likely to be chosen for many years to come . Turn which way he liked , it was supposed that a majority of the people was ready to lend him its support . Whatever might have been said of his abilitie* or character as a whole , it was still universally believed that in the two essential qualities of honesty and obstinacy he enjoyed a considerable superiority over any candidate that the country could hope to see pass the ordeal of a political caucus . If there was one quality expressed in General Grant 's face , it was that of dogged resolution . If there was any moral in his career , it was to be found in the example of silent perseverance . The most careful search could not have produced out of the whole population of the United States a single man who had offered more proofs of a stubborn will , nor one from whom the public might expect a more resolute adherence to a purpose once fixed . It was commonly supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inauguration , on his course in regard // to the civil service . His non-partisan character , his military training , his inheritance of an administrative system in which the two great parties divided the patronage , and , above all , his open and frank expressions of opinion , publicly reported and undenied , all seemed to point towards a very moderate exercise of executive power . The public , outside the ranks of the trifling proportion of citizens who are directly engaged in managing party machinery , accepted this foregone conclusion with a sense of relief and almost of joy . The press was resigned to it , and as a body was ready if not actively to support , at any rate to abstain from actively opposing the conservative tendencies of the President . A stranger who looked at the national institutions with the old assumption that the voice of the people guides the course of the government , would have thought nothing more easy than for the President to lift his administration , by a single touch , out of the mire of political corruption . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events , the most natural explanation of his first proceedings is to be found in some such idea . He selected a Cabinet which seemed to have but one bond of sympathy , and this one bond the common freedom from political entanglement . The wish to escape party dictation was more evident than the means of doing so were well chosen . The attempt failed , and the President yielded to political pressure so far as to make a new selection ; but even after this partial check , the Cabinet contained only one member who was distinctly a representative rather of the Republican party than of the Republican sentiment of the country . The Cabinet once formed , it became necessary to establish a rule in regard to inferior appointments . Here too the popular expectation turned out to be well founded . Instructions were duly given to the effect that there should be no sweeping and partisan changes . Removals from office might indeed be made in cases of incompetence or misbehavior , or for reasons of economy , or even where extreme partisanship had compromised the loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of political opinions was to be authorized . This was the principle laid down by the President to the mem // hers of his Cabinet for the rule of the departments , - a principle sound , just , and popular , which deserved and in the end would probably have received universal applause . How was it that this rule was not carried into effect ? Upon whom does the blame rest that this opportunity , which was so rare and so promising , was thrown away ? That the President 's intentions were defeated here even more decisively than in the arrangement of the Cabinet , is only too evident , but that the blame for this defeat rests on him or on his advisers is an assumption that the public is not justified in making . However strongly one may be prejudiced against General Grant 's final capitulation , it is only his due to say that he did not surrender with a good grace . No distant observer can judge fairly of the difficulties to which a President is subjected when he attempts to maintain such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Nothing could be easier than to announce that faithful and competent servants of the government should not be disturbed , but nothing was more difficult than to maintain the promise . In the struggle which followed , the President stood alone . The great mass of his friends , who cared nothing for office or patronage , could neither see what was going forward , noP could they lend him encouragement or support . They only knew that General Grant , penned up in the White House , was surrounded by a hungry army of political adventurers whose trade was an object of popular odium or contempt . Had the army of office-seekers marched alone against the White House , General Grant would probably have routed it , large as it was , with the utmost ease . Such men might fret him , but they would have found him a difficult instrument to play upon . They came , therefore , supported on one side by all the personal influence , on the other by all the political power , they could control , and day after day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impossible . There are many things that a President can not evade , and among the first of these is the duty of listening with patience and replying with courtesy to the leading men of his party . A senator may be tedious , ill-mannered , and a notorious rogue , but the double majesty of State and Senate speaks from his lips and commands a hearing . // Nor was it possible for the President to say that the remonstrances and the complaints of office-seekers were without foundation . The practice of removing officials , in order to appoint political or personal friends to their vacant posts , was one which custom had firmly established . Whether good or bad , it existed , and President Grant had been nominated and elected without having given any public warning that this custom was to be changed . To act upon the new rule without suitable notice was unfair to his friends ; for however just the reform might be in the abstract , in practice it would be considered a refusal of confidence to individuals , and would tend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly appeal of this sort was difficult to resist . The applicant was perhaps a soldier , a comrade of the President , a man who had suffered in the national cause . His spokesman might be a member of Congress , a consistent Republican , and a cordial supporter of General Grant in days when his supporters were few ; as a member of Congress his value might be all the greater because he came from a district which no other Republican could control , and where even he thought the executive patronage essential for his re-election . He would urge that the principle of rotation in office was a necessary element in the organization of parties ; it held them together , stimulated their activity , and could not be suddenly abandoned without a shock , the only possible result of which would be that the President must lose a devoted friend in Congress in order to substitute a Democrat in his place , and this for the mere purpose of retaining Andrew Johnson s officials . Or if the President held firm against reasoning , there remained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resist or evade than any weapon in the whole armory of logic . Even when this had failed to affect a muscle of the President 's dogged and imperturbable features , there were expedients in reserve which might smooth away every difficulty . There are few things to which politicians will not descend , and one favorite method by which to rid themselves of their enemies , as it is the most dishonest and the most insidious , is generally the most successful . The duties of a government officer are such as very commonly make // trouble between him and the persons with whom he is obliged to come in contact , and it frequently happens that men who imagine themselves ill-treated are ready to believe , and active in spreading , any charges against a government officer whose only fault is perhaps too great activity or too sharp a tongue . To put these charges on paper is an easy task , and to obtain a list of signatures extensive enough to call for attention is not very difficult , if the affair is carefully managed . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , not only by the famous whiskey ring , but by the more dangerous and powerful political ring , to drive old and tried servants from the public service , no one could fail to see that even in the best times the department is often deceived and with difficulty maintains its ground against outside pressure . There seems to be no limit to the elasticity of respectable men 's consciences when their interests and their pride are involved . Thus the provision that governmeiit officers shall not be removed except for cause may be practically evaded , and the President or the Secretary , wearied out by incessant annoy*ance , is happy at last to yield the point and to cover his conscience by the " charges " which he has never investigated . All this , however , is but child 's play . The President might perhaps have yielded to these incessant personal appeals or to the small intrigues which backed them , but he would have yielded in this case to individual influence , not to political combinations ; he would have lowered his personal authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To show that the heart of the evil is here , and that , until reform can reach this height , reform must be imperfect and may be mischievous , it will be necessary to look back for an instant on the past history of the government . The early administrations , from the time of Washington to the time of Jackson , were , in spite of all political differences , practically one continuous government ; that is , the President , whoever he might be , stood as regarded the legislature and the political parties as merely the temporary head of a permanent executive system , which was meant to furnish , and did in fact furnish , the necessary solidity and continuity without which no government can last . The President represented , // not a party , nor even the people either in a mass or in any of its innumerable divisions , but an essential part of the frame of government ; that part which was neither legislature nor judiciary ; a part which in the nature of society must of necessity exist , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system by itself , in order to balance the other portions of the structure . The President might die , but the office could not be x*acant . He might be sent back to private life , but his successor took up the instruments which he laid down . He might be incompetent as a British king , but the permanent system of which he represented the power and the wisdom would save him from contempt . He might be unprincipled as a French emperor , but the established courses of administration , more powerful than mere law , would hold his hand . The five early Presidents accepted and maintained this position , to their own advantage and to that of the country . Nor did President Jackson essentially change it . He introduced , it is true , the rule of punishing officials whose only duty was to the government for holding opinions which were hurt ful only to himself , if they were hurtful at all ; but his very attitude towards the Senate implied a high sense of his official duty , and so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its power , if not in all its dignity . When he passed away , however , and a succession of weaker men assumed his place , the effects of his example were little by little drawn into service to break down this bulwark of the executive . By an unwritten law of the Constitution , which has seldom been found at fault , the nervous system of the great extra-constitutional party organizations finds its centre in the United States Senate . As the party organizations grew in development and strength , the Senate became more and more the *eat of their intrigues ; and when the party organizations discovered that their power would be greatly increased by controlling the executive patronage , the Senate lent all its overruling influence to effect this result , and soon became through its individual members the largest dispenser of this patronage . This was , however , only the first step . Mr. Marcy 's celebrated declaration , drawn from the sink of New York politics , // 449 " To the victors belong the spoils , " was mischievous , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the habit of consulting friendly senators and representatives in regard to special appointments , and when he now broke down the permanence and dignity of that administrative system of which he aught to have been the champion , he only admitted individual members of the legislature to a wider influence in executive patronage than they had hitherto enjoyed . But the movement could not stop here . When it was that Congress first began to claim as a right the nominating power which it had until then held as a favor , is a question difficult to answer with exactness , but at all events the concession has been made within the last ten years . It may be safe to say , on the authority of a person well informed as to the history of times in which he has acted a great part , that the assumption by members of Congress of local patronage as a right was first conceded in principle by the first administration of Mr. Lincoln , in 1861 . The earlier and notorious instance of Mr. Douglas , in his Illinois campaign , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By this concession , the executive , the great , permanent constitutional power , which Washington and Jefferson represented , and which the wisdom of our own times aims to suppress , delivered over to the legislature its independence as a co-ordinate branch of the government . Its moral weight , and its individual character as a permanent influence in the government , ruled by administrative principles and guided by conservative maxims drawn from its own history , were rudely shaken by the first blow , but its absolute power was reduced only by the second . " If the executive power , or any considerable part of it , is left in the hands either of an aristocratical or a democratical assembly , it will corrupt the legislature as necessarily as rust corrupts iron , or as arsenic poisons the human body ; and when the legislature is corrupted the people are undone . " This principle , laid down by an American writer upon government before the Constitution was framed , received a striking illustration in the result of that revolution which threw the executive patronage into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accidental cause of bringing the // evil to a head , and if any one is cnrious to follow the exact process by which this poison of executive power works in corrupting a legislature and a people , it is only necessary to watch what has since occurred . Since the foundation of the government there has been no scandal and no corruption which could be compared in its mischievous effects to the disgraceful bargaining for office which took place between President Johnson and the Senate . Even the men who shared in it were ashamed . No one has a word of defence for it . This attempt on the part of the legislature to exercise the executive power , has produced in Congress and in the country an indifference to strict rules of wrong and right , a contempt for personal dignity , a cynical assumption of official dishonesty , and a patient assent to the supposed necessity of corruption , which nothing but a great popular reaction can overcome . There is no room here for moderate language or for halfway modes of thought . Men must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face to face the bald and disgusting fact that members of Congress can not be honest with such a power in their hands . Even the best will consult his own interests in distributing patronage , and this means that he will convert a sacred public trust into a private property , - an act which by every known code is stigmatized as the highest of crimes . The senator who buys outright with his own money his seat in the national legislature is guilty of an act not more dishonorable to himself and far less hurtful to the public interests than that which he commits in paying for the same dignity out of the nation's* means , at the expense of the nation 's future good , by an appointment to office . Intrigue and venality are the necessary accompaniments of such an adjustment of powers , and un- ' fortunately , under the American system , political corruption can not be confined to a class . An aristocracy may indeed be corrupt without infecting the great mass of people beneath it ; these may remain sound to the core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes intolerable . Such has again and again been the case in England when she seemed tottering on the verge of fall . But in America there is no such reserved force . The inevitable effect of opening a permanent and copi // ous source of corruption in the legislature must be that the people are undone . Thus , when General Grant came into power , the executive which bad originally been organized as a permanent system with a permanent and independent existence , and a temporary head , was wholly changed in its nature . While the first five Presidents had in fact formed a continuous government , protected from encroachments by its continuous character , the last five have been the representatives of so many violent revolutions . At first it had been supposed that these revolutions were only the results of party triumphs ( " I never said that the victors should plunder their own camp , " is the commentary of Mr. Marcy on his own previous declaration ) . As such , they were excused . But this is no longer pretended . The whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whatever happens , Congress has established the right to seize and overthrow the whole administration ' once in every four years forever . It is folly to suppose that the executive can maintain itself while such a right is conceded or even theoretically acknowledged . It is equal folly to imagine that the government itself can endure under a strain which would have broken the Roman Empire into fragments . General Grant , therefore , whether he knew it or not , was attempting a far more serious reform than any mere improvement of the civil service implies , a reform in comparison with which the proposed saving of $ 100,000,000 a year to the treasury was but a trifle . The question was not whether he as an individual would make or refuse to make certain appointments , but whether he had the power to wrest the executive authority from the hands of Congress ; whether he could obey or understand the meaning of his oath ; whether the President was to remain where the Constitution placed him , or whether the Senate was to snatch more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so deep a root that the people in their disgust would cheer on some modern Gracchus to attempt by sedition a reform which could no longer be accomplished by law . What might have been the result of President Grant 's experiment , had he persevered , is a problem // that for the present must remain unsolved . Before a week had passed it had become clear that the President 's perseverance in his attempt would provoke a personal rupture with so many members of the legislature , and secret hostility in so many more , as to endanger the success of the administration . The President gave way . Then began those cruel scenes which for months reduced the city of Washington to such a condition as is caused by an ordinary pestilence or famine . Private suffering is of small consequence where the nation is the chief sufferer . It matters little how many miserable women and worn-out men , the discarded servants of the IRepublic , are to be ground to death under the wheels of this slow-moving idol of faction , since their tears or agony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help these in their supplications to the inexorable appointment-clerk . Therefore , if it is any consolation to the public to doubt or to hope that the private injustice done and misery caused were exaggerated , - although few persons who had occasion to be near will share their trust , - let them have the benefit of the doubt and rejoice in it . The argument can well afford to spare this poor appeal to human sympathy . To a certain extent General Grant 's administration did only what had been done by its predecessors , and what has long been familiar to the public mind . Although much has been said against the President for his selection of personal friends and relatives for office , so far as this choice had any political meaning it was rather deserving of praise and support , as the last remnant of the President 's defeated purpose of rescuing the public service from the taint of political corruption . If a similar process of selection had been carried , with proper care and a wider acquaintance with men , through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low intrigues of partisan politicians , would have been greatly checked . In this particular , on the contrary , it was reserved for the administration of President Grant to descend lower than the worst of its predecessors in the scale of self-degradation . The Grand Army of the Republic was not perhaps organized as a political association . Its nominal object was rather one of charity , and it is believed to have proved useful in lending its // 453 protection or assistance to soldiers and soldiers ' families in distress . As a charitable and useful society , it contains many members of the highest character , and its chief , General Logan , has done good service to the country , and deserves respect for it . But whether the original organization was intended to be political or not , it certainly plunged into politics very soon after its existence began , and by the time General Grant entered office it had already reached the lowest level of political activity . Under the pretence of clearing Rebels from the public service , it organized within the departments an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never yet been degraded enough to cover with its protection . The history of every clerk , from the highest to the lowest , was ransacked to obtain evidence of his political opinions ; and every one who fell under suspicion was watched , his words taken down , even his looks carefully noted . The evidence thus collected was duly reported to the proper authorities of the organization , and the officers of the Grand Army of the Republic , on the strength of this testimony , secretly acquired by means which were once thought disgraceful , then made a formal demand upon the United States government , through the heads of departments , denouncing , like Jacobins of the reign of terror , the criminals thus condemned without a hearing , and demanding their removal for the benefit of soldiers of the Grand Army . If there is anything in the most liberal view of this action that can be made to palliate or excuse the outrage , it would be well to make it known . The government owes it to its own dignity , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever have tolerated any approach to such interference with its duties , while the mere suggestion that its action could have been affected by such means is in itself so near an insult that it would not be fitting for the pages of this Review . But in order that there may be no danger of incurring the charge of exaggerating the importance of the subject , it will be well to insert here the actual form of address used by the Grand Army in communicating with the administration . // " To the Hon. . . . " Secretary of " Sia : - We , the undersigned , a committee of the G. A. R. appointed for the purpose of examining into the political status of the employees of the . . . . Department , have the honor to present to the Honorable Secretary the accompanying lists , and respectfully ask the removal of these persons and the appointment , to fill the vacancies , of soldiers and sailors . " Very respectfully , Then follows the list of names , with the accompanying annotations - " 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 . Those who made it their duty to rigidly enforce my policy ' in word and deed . " Those having no mark against their names are or have been recognized as Democrats until recently . " Those marked doubtful ' left open for further examination . " The extraordinary nature of this performance becomes doubly striking when it is remembered that " we , the undersigned , " who were thus acting as a committee for " examining into the political status of the employees of the departments , " and who assumed to dictate to the Secretary as to who was to be removed and who appointed , were of necessity the Secretary 's own clerks ! The Treasury was the richest field for rewarding the labor of these disinterested men . Mr. Boutwell , fresh from Congress and trained in a partisan school , was the only member of the Cabinet who had thoroughly mastered the practice and principles of that species of political science which is peculiarly American , and who believed in its wisdom and necessity with all the earn*stuess of the New England mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to the work with zeal ; but it would be unfair to suppose that he could lower himself so far as to lend direct support to a system so odious and so disreputable as that pursued by the Grand Army . Mr. Boutwell did not act directly upon the information furnished by the Grand Army . Instead of this , he inaugurated another inquisition of his own , by which he might test the political fidelity of // his subordinates . It is surely impossible that these two tribunals can have carried on their investigations side by side and hand in hand within the walls of the Treasury . Non ; tali auxilio ! Without such an additional humiliation , it 15 enough to know that under this double terror the whole moral tone of the department gave way . Every clerk distrusted his neighbor , and the air of the Treasury , which in ordinary times is not altogether pure , now seemed heavy with the whispers of delators . The new administration began its career by creating or encouraging in its service the same system of spies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an absolute despotism . To palliate it by alleging its narrow field of action is absurd . It not only existed , but its single fault was found to be its too great efficiency . In more than one case the denounced and removed official proved to have been as good and true a Republican as the Secretary himself , no matter how narrow the creed ; and before the work was completed , it was commonly understood at Washington that both Mr. Boutweli and his appointment-clerk had expressed themselves as profoundly disappointed and disgusted with the mistakes which they had made . While these events were taking place in the Treasury building , the city of Washington was filled with adventurers in search of office . Senators and members stood aghast at the work they were expected to do ; but they did it . Almost every department of the executive patronage was swept clean ; and although there may be a question whether the new appointments were as a whole better or worse than the old , there can be no doubt that they were not made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part the same gross political jobs that have for so many years stamped the character of American politics . Yet although the Treasury with its vast power was entirely in the hands of the plunderers , and the Post-Office seemed to follow the Treasury , the resistance to political dictation was still vigorously maintained in other departments of the government , where men of another temper were in control . Several of the Secretaries preserved their trust with courage and dignity , but among all the members of // the Cabinet the most remarkable contrast to the pliability of Mr. Boutwell was fnrnished by the dogged obstinacy of the Attorney-General . Accident had brought side by side in President Grant 's Cabinet two men who might naturally have been supposed to hold the same political ideas . They both came from the same Congressional district ; they had for years belonged to the same political party ; there was no jealousy to divide them ; both were sincere , honest , and capable . Yet one was the type of that narrow political morality which has obtained so general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and party promotion ; the other was by birth and by training a representative of the best New England school , holding his moral rules on the sole authority of his own conscience , indifferent to opposition whether in or out of his party , obstinate to excess , and keenly alive to the weaknesses in which he did not share . Judge Hoar beloiiged in fact to a class of men who had been gradually driven from politics , but whom it is the hope of reformers to restore . Mr. Boutwell belonged to the class which has excluded its rival , but which has failed to fill with equal dignity the place it has usurped . At the outset of the administration the essential difference in the characters of these two men was brought out in lively contrast . While Mr. Boutwell distributed his offices with liberal hands to senators and representatives , Grand Armies and State delegations , the Attorney-General sat silently at his desk , and glared through his spectacles with a sort of grim humor at the man who dared ask him to perpetrate a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was listening with approval to the account of some assessor 's entire unfitness for the Republicans of Ohio or Minnesota , Judge Hoar had reached the somewhat absurd determination that not even his bedridden messenger should be removed , although the Attorney-General should be reduced to running his own errands . The men who attempted to lead the Attorney-General came away from his office with a low opinion of his intelligence , which they expressed with somewhat excusable intemperance both in public and private . They complained that he did not " see things , " where his real offence was in seeing far too much ; and they added that his temper was unpleasantly irritable , and his obstinacy that of a // mule . Much allowance is to be made for politicians in such a position , and it is possibly true that the Attorney-General may have occasionally allowed his wit or his temper to express his thoughts with impolitic freedom . He had not been placed in that office in order to provide for politicians , and he certainly carried out this negative purpose . The removals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made with little reference to personal preferences . Among other posts , the New York marshalship , usually considered as an important item in senatorial patronage , was for once given unsought and unexpected to a man who was by no means calculated to serve the ordinary ends of New York politicians . Such reckless indifference to the claims of party managers was naturally followed by a liberal distribution of personal abuse , which must be the inevitable lot of any public man who holds that his duty to the government is higher than his duty to factions among the people or in the legislature ; and the public may confidently expect that the persevering attempts to drive Judge Hoar from the Cabinet , from which his approach*ing retirement is so regularly announced by the officious agents of the press , will end only when their object is accomplished . Notwithstanding the resistance of this portion of the Cabinet , it is still true that the administration of President Grant as a whole will be considered as having carried the principle of rotation in office and submission to external interference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been reached before . The claim of members of the legislature to control the local and even the general appointments for which the President and the President alone ought to be held responsible has not been met by any sufficient assertion of the executive dignity , and is now so deeply rooted in custom that few members of the legislature can at once succeed in grasping the idea that no correspoAding right exists . One of the characteristic stories told of the Attorney-General represents him as bewildering some delegation that recommended a certain appointment by the simple reply that he did not think the public service required a change of the incumbent . The bewilderment of the gentlemen was due to the fact that this recommendation happened to // be the unanimous act of an entire State delegation in Congress , and it seemed impossible that the executive could assert a higher duty to itself than it owed to an entire State delegation . But even the partial independence which the executive is still allowed , an independence commonly gained by balancing one congressional influence against another , works evil rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable results of the situation that the better class of politicians on whom a President ought to rely , men of dignity and self-respect , will not lower themselves to this struggle for patronage . Their suggestions or wishes once expressed and met by refusal or neglect , they retire , offended and mortified , but too proud to beg for favors . Not so with the baser type of professional politicians . These are never wearied and never absent . IDay and night they weave their web round the President and his advisers . Some intriguer , who has made his way to eminence by means of the skill with which he has managed the tools of political corruption in a State where ev*n before his time political corruption had become an art that few could master ; who by the meanness of his policy and the pliancy of his character had fairly broken the back of his party , which at its last gasp made itself a stepping-stone to pass him safely into the Senate , and then sank into hopeless impotence ; some such man , thus sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy which had already brought a great party into contempt on the narrower field of State politics , allows few things to stand in the way of his determination to control the tremendous patronage which the government holds in his constituency . One repulse does not affect him . The government may at first disregard his remonstrances and scarcely conceal its contempt for his opinions ; but sooner or later his persistence and his skill conquer a foothold , and he stands before the country the dispenser of Federal patronage , while , just as surely " as rust corrupts iron or as arsenic poisons the human body , " his advice and his presence enfeeble and pervert the tone and energy of the administration . This difficulty of dividing responsibility between the exeenlive and the legislature is one which is too serious to exist long . The country has now arrived at a point where it must // either go back or go forward . The great executive authority established by the Constitution as the counterpoise of the great legislative authority has gradually abandoned , first , that character as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of weak Presidents ; secondly , the right of nomination to executive offices which belong within the constituencies of members of the legislature ; and finally , it only remains to adopt a measure formally urged in the last session of Congress , by which the entire patronage of the executive may be allotted between the several States in pro rata proportions , and then the legislature will have grasped the whole executive power , leaving in its place only the empty honor of a name . The experience of the present government has shown that even a President so determined in character and so strong in popular support as General Grant shrank from the attempt to reform the civil service as one which was beyond his powers . Not only has this opportunity been lost , - an opportunity which may never occur again , - but the Republican party by its action in this case seems to have shut the door to reform . Had General Grant succeeded in carrying out his original purpose , public opinion might have been roused to enforce the precedent on future administrations ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Congress can now propose a measure of reform , which , if worth consideration at all , must , by securing the permanence of present office-holders , practically jockey any future administration out of its power ; and it is equally difficult to see why any future Democratic President should consider himself bound by such a law . Nothing remains but to act outside of all party organizations , and to appeal with all the earnestness that the emergency requires , not to Congress nor to the President , but to the people , to return to the first principles of the government , and to shut off forever this source of corruption in the state . If there were any reason to suppose that a deep-laid scheme existed on the part of any member or members of the legisture to usurp the government , there might indeed be some reason to despair ; but in fact the danger is at present due rather to the indifference of the better senators and to their natural and proper . spirit of common pride in the dignity of // their House , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has betrayed the executive , but a long line of Presidents who have failed to respect their trust . And as the evil is due , not so much to Congress as to the Presidents , so the remedy must be sofrght , not in any arbitrary legislation , but in the creation of such a sound public opinion as will hold future Presidents more closely to their charge . Supported by such an aroused public feeliiig , the President will certainly act with success . It is not merely his right , but his duty , to originate any reform in the civil service which may seem to him useful or necessary ; and if he understands the meaning of an oath , he is bound to carry out such a reform in spite of all resistance . Every President , even though steeped from his cradle in an atmosphere of county politics , must still feel , on assuming his office , some part of that permanent responsibility which weighs upon the executive chair no matter who may be its occupant . The outward forms of royalty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person but to the office , are not allowed to republican rulers , but the great administrative system over which the accident of a birth has placed one man , and the still greater accident of a popular caucus has placed another , demands of both the same submission and sacrifice of selfish purposes , and gives to both the same sense of deep responsibility . No ruler will intentionally betray this trust . The system is too vast for one weak man to overthrow . He may indeed betray the people who have trusted him , but he will do his best to defend or increase the powers of his office . He can not entirely pervert the great system behind him into a personal property . He must be controlled and guided by it , even more than it can be controlled by him . If its machinery is clogged , he is the sufferer ; if mistakes are committed , he is responsible ; if violence is at hand , his life is the forfeit . Of the thirty-six million people in the United States , the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the administrative system . The President therefore , be he who he may , must be expected to prefer for his service the old and educated servants of the government , and to exercise , or at least wish to exercise , some discretion in his appointments . Arguing from general // principles , it is safe to assume that the President does as a rule attempt , though of late years more and more feebly , to resist the dictation of politicians within the range of his official duties . With a sympathetic public behind him , the President may commonly be depended upon to institute and to maintain such reforms as experience has proved to be necessary . Even of late years the executive has shown examples of its capacity for originating , and of its persistence in urging , its ideas of reform , such as only need application on a wider field in order to carry every measure that reformers demand . The history of the struggle made by the State Department to improve its consular service throws a flood of light , not only upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the manner in which alone they can be properly met . There are probably few persons in the United States who are aware that any such attempt has ever been made by the government , or who have the least idea whether it has succeeded or whether it has failed . It will therefore be interesting to tell the story , so far as it can be disinterred from congressional debates and executive documents . In 1853 , Mr. Everett , when Secretary of State to President Fillmore , negotiated with the government of France a consular convention , which was then thought to be the most successful model for that especial class of treaty that had yet been framed . Among the articles of the convention was one by which the existence of consular pupils was formally recognized as a part of the system in both countries . No such office , however , existed in the American service , and the department appears to have framed or accepted the article only with the intention of availing itself at some future time of this expedient for quietly improving its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treaty , almost immediately quitted office , and was succeeded by Mr. Marcy under the presidency of Mr. Pierce . Nothing was done by Mr. Marcy either in 1853 or in the following year , nor even when in 1855 the necessity of revising the entire consular system had compelled Congress to pass a very elaborate act for the purpose . But in 1856 it was found that this act of 1855 was itself incomplete , and required a supplementary law , which was duly prepared in committee after // much consultation with the department , and the original draft , furnished by the department to the committee , contained a clause authorizing the President to appoint twenty-five consular pupils with salaries of * 1,000 a year , first having subjected them to a proper examination to secure their fitness for the post . Mr. Marcy had asked for seventy-five , but the committee cut the number down by two thirds , and the department acquiesced , having by its urgency succeeded in convincing the committee of the material advantages to be gained by the new agents thus created . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and passed without debate by common agreement , probably no member outside of the committee ever having taken the trouble to read it . Mr. Marcy instantly issued elaborate instructions regulating the standard of qualification , and the process to be followed in examining candidates , and he promised somewhat too hastily that deserving pupils should be recommended to the President from time to time for promotion to vacant consulates . Unfortunately Congress had made no special appropriation for these pupils , and before Mr. Marcy could make any actual appointment it was necessary to wait for the appropriations of the following year . Accordingly , when Congress met in December , the Appropriation Bill contained the little item : " For consular pupils , $ 25,000 . " No sooner had the House in committee reached this paragraph than it burst into a fit of temper . The Committee of Ways and Means attempted feebly to defend it , but General Quitman , of Mississippi , after stating that consuls were diplomats , and that the best diplomacy was the diplomacy of the backwoods , the honest diplomacy of republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools of Europe , threatened to propose by way of amendment an appropriation for establishing a professorship of diplomacy in the Department of State . This idea , in itself not altogether unworthy of consideration , seemed to settle the doubts of the House . The appropriation was struck out with scarcely a dissentient vote , and the Republican majority for once congratulated itself and its Democratic friends upon an agreement of opinion . The bill next went to the Senate Committee on Finance , of // which Mr. R. M. T. Hunter , of Virginia , was chairman . In the mean while Mr. Marcy had heard of the action taken by the House , and was not prepared to abandon his scheme so easily . He wrote a long letter to Mr. Hunter , urging him to restore the appropriation , and stating with much force the arguments in its favor . Mr. Hunter acceded to his wish , and the bill was reported to the Senate with the item replaced . Debate instantly rose on this point , and continued at some length . Curiously enough , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first , that the project was impracticable , owing to the want of permanence in our system of government ; and , secondly , that it would merely enable the President to cause his friends ' sons to be educated abroad . Mr. Collamer suggested - and his suggestion was met by the laughter of the Senate - that the next step might be to educate a President ; a notion which might perhaps please the public better than it would suit the ambition of senators . But it was reserved for Mr. Hale , of New Hampshire , to state the true ground of objection in a manner which admits of no response . " I am opposed to this policy entirely , " said Mr. Hale . " I am opposed to it , not because I think our consuls are educated too highly as a general fact , but I dislike this way of doing it . If we begin here , where is it to stop ? We shall have then to appoint pupils for amba*sadors , and , when you begin that , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a fallen man , and Mr. Hale is now fallen so low that an assailant must stoop far to reach him . It would be pleasanter now to pass him by and abstain from pointing a moral at his expense ; but in this case Mr. Hale was the representative of a class which must be struck wherever it can be reached , by every legitimate weapon , until it is beaten into insignificance , or the hope of reform may be abandoned at the outset . In the light of subsequent history there is a bitterness of satire in these words of Mr. Hale , that Juvenal might have envied . What was it to Mr. Hale whether ambassadors were to be educated or not ? Was it that such a condition would shut the door to him and his like ? If by any such provision the country could have been spared the degradation which has been inflicted upon it by the conduct // Oct. of men like Mr. Hale as its representatives , there can be no stronger argument for its instant adoption . Mr. IRusk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already had patronage enough , and that this appropriation was made in the interest of politicians to increase it . This objection was ingenious , but it showed either that Mr. iRusk was deeply skilled in the least straightforward practices of European diplomacy , or that his political knowledge was not such as to fit him for the high office of senator . The true secret of opposition to this measure , and to all similar measures which aim at restoring permanence to the public service , is the fear indicated by Mr. Hale that the President will then have fewer offices to divide among members of Congress . The political purity of Mr. Rusk and Mr. Hale stood out in brilliant relief on these two conflicting backgrounds . In spite of the exertions of the two Virginia senators , when the vote was taken twenty-five senators recorded themselves against the measure , while only eleven could be found to support it . Side by side in the majority stand the names of Brown of Mississippi and Collamer of Vermont , of Fessenden of Maine and Fitzpatrick of Alabama , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of Mallory , of Toombs and of Trumbull , of Wade , of Wilson , and of Yulee . The list alone shows that no common principle could have directed the vote , and the result will show whether the honest men or the rogues had reason to be best pleased with such a coalition . Among the minority were Messrs . Bayard , Hunter , Mason , Pugh , Toucey , and- most significant of all - Cass . Not yet satisfied with his triumph , Mr. IRusk immediately offered an amendment repealing the clause in the bill of 1856 , by which the President was authorized to appoint the consular pupils whose pay had so quickly been stopped . It was indeed unusual to introduce such legislation in an appropriation bill , but Mr. Brown justified this step on the ground that " this lubberly Congress , " as lie was pleased to call the body in which he took a somewhat prominent part , would not stop to pass an independent measure ; and all the Republicans present supported the amendment , which was intended to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to // provide the nation with a better service . The clause was accordingly repealed by a vote of twenty-one to fourteen . According to modern theories of the United States government , this signal discomfiture should have stopped further discussion , and the executive should have rested content with such a consular service as Congress was disposed to maintain . The President , it is true , has sworn faithfully to execute the laws , but he never meant in earnest to fulfil his pledge . Congress makes and Congress executes the laws . The President is but the instrument of the legislature . Mr. Marcy , whose name has sheltered from contempt the political maxim which has brought the executive so low , made in this instance an attempt to repair in part the injury he had helped to inflict , and found that it was easier to degrade than to elevate . With one hand he had overthrown the government ; with the other he attempted only to restore an insignificant corner of it , and he failed so utterly as to leave the matter in a worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fifty years ago the whole administrative service was permanent ; yet in 1856 even such a man as Mr. Fessenden could say that the permanence of twenty-five consular clerks was contrary to the spirit of the government , and the public would have believed him if it had cared enough about the subject ever to read the debate . Nevertheless , though Congress had in effect sharply reprQved the executive , though Mr. Marcy was compelled to abandon forever his hope of undoing some slight portion of the mischief he had helped to cause , and though Mr. Fessenden sneered at the notion of permanence and technical education in the civil service , yet the Department of State , vindicating its rights as a permanent executive power which was intended to guide the President as well as to be guided by him , and thus by its experience and knowledge to give character and solidity to the government , refused to accept the result as final , and persevered in its project of reform . Mr. Marcy retired from office in March , 185*T , and was succeeded by Secretary Cass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effort to obtain these consular pupils . A question of salary was involved in the matter , and compli* // Civil - Se reice Reform . Oct. cated it to some extent . This formed a side-issue which had nothing to do with the principle involved . It was perhaps easier both for the Secretary to press , and for Congress to resist , the proposed change when it was presented merely as an increase of salary to a half-starved race of officials who in most cases were incompetent to do their work , than when it came in the form of a direct question of educating public servants . In every point of view , however , the department continned to urge the reform . One letter of Secretary Cass bears date the 25th January , 1858 , another the 11th May of the same year , and the correspondence forms an1 executive document printed for the use of the House in 1859 . Yet Secretary Cass went out of office in 1861 , and the department had not then succeeded in gaining the slightest concession from Congress . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the department in March , 1861 , and during the next year was probably not less busied with his duties than Mr. Cass and Mr. Marcy had been with theirs . It was not likely that a small administrative matter such as this would seem to Mr. Seward to require attention at a time when the national existence depended on his success . Yet , before the year 1862 was over , Congress again received the inevitable document urging the creation of consular pupils . Ten years had now passed since Mr. Everett 's first step , and the department had thus far , in spite of all its obstinacy , failed to make the smallest progress ; nor was it more successful in 1862 . Congress paid no more attention to Mr. Seward than it had paid to Mr. Cass , and the year 1863 passed by without a sign . In those days , however , Mr. Seward had power , and knew how to overcome an obstacle . By the close of 1863 the department had discovered the way to work with effect . Instead of wasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his efforts to the Senate , and when the usual recommendation on behalf of the consular pupils was made by the department to the committees , the Senate Committee had been so thoroughly canvassed that it at last adopted an amendment to the Appropriation Bill as sent up from the House , and , by restoring the old law of 1856 , again brought the whole subject up for discussion in Congress . The debate // that followed was in a somewhat different tone from that of 1856 . Either senators had made a stride in advance , or they had given place to new men . Mr. Hunter , Mr. Mason , and Mr. Pugh , the supporters of Secretary Marcy , had vanished , as well as Mr. Rusk , Mr. Hale , Mr. Brown , and the rest , his opponents . Nevertheless , Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Collamer , Mr. Trumbull , Mr. Wade , and Mr. Wilson , were still there , allowing ample means for determining whether it was the time that had changed , or only the men . In point of fact only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune this one man was Senator Fessenden . His committee had reported the amendment ; and when the amendinent came on for debate , he met the attack of Mr. Collamer with a frank avowal which was likely to carry sympathy wherever it was read . He spoke at once of the old bill of 1856 , and of the opposition which compelled its repeal : " The great and leading consideration for its repeal was that Congress did not believe the thing would be of a permanent character . Upon deliberation I have changed my views , and I am willing to admit that I have changed my views I have a hope that the intelligence of the country will bring it and is fast bringing it to the conclusion that , if we can find men who are competent and educated to the business of attending to our commercial affairs abroad without being politicians and partisans , their services will be recognized by any administration that may come into power , for the benefit of the government itself , and that where they have distinguished themselves they will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to render us vastly better services than we have as yet received from any quarter . " To this appeal , Mr. Sumner added the most energetic support , and between them , these two Senators and their committees made successful head against the attacks of Mr. Collamer and Mr. Reverdy Johnson , Mr. John Sherman and Mr. Grimes . The consular pupils were restored by a vote of twenty to sixteen , - Messrs . Trumbull and Wilson following Mr. Fessenden , while Mr. Wade remained true to his old vote . The amended bill then went back to the House , where an earnest attempt was made to procure its passage , but the // House again took the bit in its teeth and kicked viciously at the consular pupils . The most characteristic argument against them was made by Mr. Brooks of New York . " True , " said he , " there are but twenty-five consular pupils named in this bill , but these twenty-five are but a nest-egg of a vast system which in the end will be imposed upon the whole diplomatic system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great calamity , a great misfortune to this country , if we should be represented abroad in high places by consular pupils , by men who have been twenty or thirty years from their country . It is necessary for every young man to come home witbin five or ten years and free himself of the courtly associations and despotic modes of European thinking , to breathe once more the spirit of our free institutions . " This argument was probably suited to a certain class of congressmen , although personally Mr. Brooks is much too clever to allow his own eyes to be blinded by the dust which he throws in the faces of honest countrymen . Even he allowed , however , that after the short vacation , or purge , of the republican consul , his country might again employ him to advantage . But this argument of Mr. Brooks , even though he never believed a word of it , is certainly one of the most curious instances of the want of selfrespect in American society that has ever been displayed . The ntter contempt and hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demagogues would logically result in the conclusion that , if the American government is not a humbug , the citizen who remained longest abroad would be the truest to his own land . It is the foreign despot who should fear the spirit of free institutions , not the free institutions which should be harmed by the odious spectacle of foreign despotism ; yet it has never been alleged that Napoleon or his brother emperors have feared the contact of free American opinion on their consuls and diplomats , or would have cared what the result might be , so long as their service was improved . The argument made by Mr. Brooks was a cowardly acknowledgment of distrust of democratic society . Had he said in so many words that the American citizen had no love of country and could not be trusted with the charge of himself without running a great risk of learning to hate free- / // dom , he would not have expressed the idea in clearer language . This indeed would be the only possible logical ground for retaining the present consular system ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries like the South American republics , unless the citizen of the United States in his misery loves any foreign soil better than his own . The House , however , sustained Mr. Brooks and non-concurred in the amendment . The Senate insisted ; a committee of conference was appointed , and a compromise was reached , - a compromise of so curious a nature that it is calculated to make its authors somewhat ridiculous . On the one hand , a certain number of men opposed the consular pupils becai*se they were to be made a means of improving the service by promotion , and to gratify these opponents the bill was changed in such a manner as to authorize " clerks , " but on no account to admit the notion of " pupils . " In order to diminish still further the dangers which this formidable array of twenty-five clerks threatened to the national liberties , their number was reduced to thirteen . On the other hand , a certain amount of opposition had been roused by the precisely opposite idea that perhaps , after all , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of members a clause was added providing against removal except for cause . Thus improved , the bill was passed , * and the department , after eleven years ' perseverance , obtained as a result thirteen consular clerks . Nevertheless , to the department consular pupils they were , and such they were sure to remain . Nothing is more curious , in this long contest , than to notice how incessantly the depart- * " The President is hereby authorized . . . . to appoint consular clerks , not exceeding thirteen in number at any one time , who shall be citizens of the United States , and over eighteen years of age at the time of their appointment , and shall be entitled to compensation for their services respectively at a rate , not exceeding one thousand dollars per annum , to be determined by the President ; and to assign such clerks , from time to time , to such consulates and with such duties as he shall direct ; and before the appointment of any such clerk shall be made , it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examination and report by an examining hoard , that the applicant is qualified and fit for the duties to which he shall be assigned ; and such report shall he laid before the President . And no clerk so appointed shall he removed from office , except for cause stated in writing , which shall be submitted to Congress at the session first following such removal . " // ment returned to this idea of pupils , - an idea to which it seemed to cling with a kind of dogged and hopeless desperation , - and how persistently Congress set it aside . Mr. Everett , Mr. Marcy , Mr. Cass , Mr. Seward , one after another , in their vain efforts to benefit the national service begged and implored for pupils . Congress declared in reply that it would create what other offices it saw fit , but pupils they should not have . With the exception of Mr. Sumner and a few others , no members of the legislature dared even to argue in favor of pupils . The argument whenever possible was pressed on different ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , flung its dozen clerks to the department , the department caught at them with great satisfaction , but at once proceeded to make them pupils after its ow*n heart . Mr. Marcy 's instructions for pupils were at once revived . Mr. Seward had indeed reminded the Senate in a long and very interesting letter , written to affect the result , that the foreign service still boasted of men who had served for twenty , thirty , and forty years , and whom the department had always succeeded in protecting against all political influence . He avowed his wish to educate new men to take their places , and he intended to effect his object in the best way he might . The consular clerks therefore were , now as before , not clerks , but pupils , in the view of the department , the act of Congress to the contrary notwithstanding . This expedient answered its purpose admirably so long as it was only necessary for the department to act for itself . The appropriation was this time secured . One by one , candidates appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned , and assigned to consuls abroad . The system worked eminently well . The pupils , so-called clerks , were useful , and their usefulness grew continually greater . Some of them were young men of parts and promise . One in particular passed a highly creditable examination , which attracted the attention of the department . lie was assigned to an important consulate , and his reports were marked by so much ability that the President soon sent in his name to the Senate for promotion to the consulship itself . It is perhaps best not to attempt to penetrate the mysteries of an executive // session , nor to seek any further explanation for the Senate 's action on appointments than such as the long story just told may be thought to indicate . In the language of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights , the legislative department has learned to exercise executive powers , and the government is one of men and not of laws . No senator would protect the consular clerk , and the Senate rejected the nomination . Whatever may have been the immediate cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourage the department . Within a short time another consular clerk was nominated to a vacant consulate , and to him the Senate appears to have offered no opposition . He was confirmed , and the department was so well pleased with its success that it quickly sent in a third and a fourth nomination of the same nature , both of which were duly confirmed by the Senate . Thus , at the close of the last administration , the department had actually made a considerable advance towards its darling object , the improvement of the service . Eleven permanent consular clerks were distributed over the world , and three more had already been promoted to *consulates . The experiment had fully answered every expectation , and the system was at last firmly established . Nevertheless , the department was not yet destined to pass beyond the range of disappointments . Another trial of its patience and endurance was now at hand , - a contingency foreseen by Mr. Fessenden , and strangely pressed by many persons as a ground for discouraging any attempt at reform . A new administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vindictive enemy of all political jobbery and corruption . The story of this disastrous time has already been told . Few disinterested spectators of the outrages then committed under cover of blind power are ever likely to look back upon that experience without a certain warmth of indignation and contempt which seems to require some personal object to vent itself upon ; but in this instance there seems to be no reason for accusing any individual of intentional wrong-doing ; or if any one was to blame the secret is hid in official places , where it can not be reached . All that the Register shows is that the department succeeded in protecting only one of its promoted pupils ; the other two , although no complaint appears to have // Oct. been made either against their efficiency or their loyalty , were removed , and their places filled in the old manner . If these were not corrupt political jobs , the department may consider itself as more than usually fortunate . After more than fifteen years of perseverance , however , which has hitherto proved successful , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary chance . Unless it is crushed outright by the legislature , it will still do its best to serve the public honestly and efficiently , and in this attempt it will receive the support of the best senators . Nor is this statement true of only one department . The story of these consular pupils has been told to show that the executive as a governing influence must and does feel the burden of its responsibility , and that no President , even though he is selected by politicians to act as their tool , can ever entirely forget or betray the trust which a power far beyond the politicians has placed in his hands . If the President is weak , it is merely because public opinion is silent and support is not to be found . Arouse this , and there will then be no danger that the President will prove indifferent to the duty of protecting the purity of his administration , or that politicians within Congress or elsewhere will assume an authority which belongs not to a man nor to any body of men , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand as the basis of any permanent reform may now be gathered together , and summed up in a single sentence : The system of government in the United States has suffered a radical change ; the executive , held by weak hands , has thrown away first its shield and then its sword , first its permanence and then its power , until it has been reduced so low that even General Grant , the most resolute and the most popular of Presidents , has recoiled from the task of raising it . As a necessa+y consequence of a weakened executive , Congress has seized and now claims as its right the most important executive powers . In exercising these powers , the legislature has , in obedience to a principle well understood by students of the science of government , converted a high public trust into an instrument of private gain , - a crime which , in morals if not in law , deserves the punishmont // attached to a felony , and justly causes , and has already brought about , a forfeiture of public confidence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corrupted legislature , party organizations have become the tools of personal intrigue ; public offices serving as the bribes by which a few men purchase personal support at the nation 's expense . Even the remotest local politics have been perverted by this curse , and beyond the limit of political activity the evil extends ultimately to the relations of man to man , degrading and corrupting society itself . If the conclusions insisted on in these pages are in any way correct , the whole subject of civil-service reform is reduced to a single principle , - the same which is asserted in the thirtieth article of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights . Tested by this touchstone , all mere experiment , all novel legislation like that suggested by Mr. Jenckes , however excellent in purpose , must be held wrong both in principle and in detail , calculated to aggravate rather than to check the evil . So far as the legisla- - ture is concerned , there is but one rule to follow . Let Congress keep its hands off executive powers . Let it not undertake to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its sphere , unless indeed it is disposed to make solicitation for office which , omnipotent as it is , respects the principles of government so far that it wisely contents itself with advising or approving competition in the civil service , but has never ventured to legislate upon it . The President already possesses all the law he needs , all the law which Jefferson or Madison required . The executive system should not depend on the legislature for the character of its service . Two separate powers should not be blindly confused . If Congress can give , Congress can take away , and as a necessary result an act of Congress may forbid the President to exercise powers which are essential to the executive office , and confer them upon a creature of the legislature . The executive can not with safety lean on this treacherous staff of legislative enactments . No doubt a great burden of responsibility is thus thrown upon the President ; and if Presidents betray the trust which // the people repose in them , and , knowing what should be done , refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as merely that of a servant to the legislature , and not that of a guardian to the public interests ; if they find their arms too weak to hold up the authority they have sworn to maintain , or if they decide to place their own ease before their official duty ,  --  reform will indeed become more difficult , although still not desperate . With a President equal to his post , who understood and accepted his responsibilities and trusted to the deep public sympathy which seldom fails a bold and honest leader , the struggle would be comparatively short . Such a President might restore the executive to its early dignity , might elevate the tone and morals of the legislature , might redeem the character of party organizations , might purify even local politics ; he might , if competitive examinations are the panacea for every evil , extend a network of them over every office , down to the Treasury porters , and establish his reforms so firmly in the minds of the people that the Republic would never again be in danger on this score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest men , giving to the government many years of renewed life , and , what is better still , a few years of high example : but such a President is to be prayed for rather than expected . Be this as it may , the true policy of reformers is to trust neither to Presidents nor to senators , but appeal directly to the people . Whatever troubles distract the state , public opinion is first responsible either for creating or tolerating them . Whenever public opinion has once declared itself in favor of civil-service reform , and against the corrupt use of patronage by politicians , the evil will cease ; nor need any anxiety be thrown away in regard to resistance by the Senate , since such factious opposition would only give to the people the opportunity of striking at the agents of corruption , an opportunity which may one day be used with effect so soon as old political issues can be finally disposed of . But before this time arrives , the public must be convinced that reform is a vital question , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a lively fancy . To effect this there is no way but to attack corruption in all its holes , to drag it before the public eye , to dissect it and hold the diseased members up to popular disgust , to give the nation 's // 4P*5 Civil-Service Reform . conscience no rest nor peace until mere vehemence of passion overcomes the sluggish self-complacency of the public mind . To build by slow degrees this deep foundation of moral conviction , to erect upon it a comprehensive and solid structure of reform , and to bequeath the result to posterity as a work not inferior in quality to that of the Republic 's founders , is an aim high enough to satisfy the ambition of one generation . Such a movement must necessarily be slow . It is scarcely worth while even to pretend a hope that anything can be at once accomplished , least of all in Congress . The few members of the legislature who are conscious of their own shortcomings , and the still smaller number who would honestly aid in restoring a better tone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common bond of sympathy , and have neither a name nor even a power of combination . Time alone , and the steady increase of corruption , can bring them so close together as to act with any purpose or vigor . Yet if there is one of them who feels in earnest the evils for which many are ready enough to profess a theoretical antipathy , he may by a comparatively simple expedient effect everything that can or need be effected by legislative action . Without in any way interfering with Mr. Jenckes 's bill , - a measure too cumbrous for the weak reforming influence in Congress to put in motion , - let him move , and press to a debate and a vote , two concise resolutions : one , recommending the President to extend the principle of competitive examinations to all branches of the service in which it might in his opinion be usefully applied ; the other , declaring the opinion of Congress that , in respect to removals from office , the executive should return to the early practice of the government . Whenever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will be time enough for the public to discuss the details of reform .
