Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : BEAUTY AFTER DEATH . from The poems ( 1864 ) " I sleep , but my heart waketh . " ..... Death 's blight upon the brow  --  His iron hand 's cold impress on the lip  --  Are not alike relentless unto all . Not always , when made ready for the grave , Are the beloved ones beautiful no more . Nor all alike to the bright throng who wait To give the welcome at the gate of heaven , Seem the pale comers from this world away . And they ,  --  the loveliest to the eyes that mourn ,  --  They , of the blest throng of the sin-forgiven , Who fairest seem to angels  --  seldom they Were of the living who are called most fair  --  Seldom the young , the gifted , or the strong . But THEY WHOM PITY FOR THE POOR HAS KEPT Tender OF HEART  --  THESE , WITH THEIR PARTING BREATH , Put ON THE SAINTLY BEAUTY OF THE BLEST ! For , oh how well that miracle is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That , when life 's changing features first are still  --  When first , with death 's transparent calm , we see Through the far depths what pearl was hidden there  --  Then , o'er the features of the blest ones " known For their good works , " like Dorcas  --  those whose " alms Are in remembrance before God , " like his To whom the " angel in bright clothing " came , Cornelius the centurion  --  there beams Light , from the warm heart that was shrined within  --  Light from the trembling of the pitying tear , Th'undying lamp lit for the sad and lone ! And , by that light  --  a smile upon the lips , Unquenched by life 's last agony  --  we know That such are they who are beloved of God :  --  Made fairer , even in Death 's icy sleep , By the unwearied " waking of the heart " Which smiles as they go beautiful to Heaven . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : FRAGMENT OF A POEM , WRITTEN FOR A MOTHER , AFTER THE DEATH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1864 ) That she we loved is with us , here , no more , We tearfully and mournfully may say  --  But not so mournfully that she is gone . Like one uplifted in a march by night , And borne on , to the morning , ' t is to her But an unwearied minute to the dawn ; While we , with torn feet , on the darkling way , Follow to that same home , where she 's at rest Waiting to give us welcome . Oh sad mother , The voice , within the soft lips where your love Look 'd for its music , is all hush 'd , we know ! The roses that it parted have grown pale . But the same voice , with its accustom 'd tones , Lends to her sweet thoughts utterance where she is ; And oh , while , in the softer air of Heaven , It unlearns only its complaining  --  say !  --  Is't well to wish , that , even to the ears That can not sleep with aching for its music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker , 1806-1867 : WAKING-DREAM IN SICKNESS . from The poems ( 1864 ) ( YALE COLLEGE , 1827 . ) The night creeps wearily . I lit my lamp To hide the brightness of that morning star That mocks me with a sleeplessness like mine  --  Coldly and glitteringly apart and lone ! How unlike life it is  --  this sickness-waking ! Conscious of life 's enfeebled link no more The soul feels death-released ; and , as the star Wakes not the colors of earth 's slumbering flowers , Nor warms the darkness of the mountain brow From which so pathlessly it soars away , So , with strange lift , unnaturally bright , The sick man 's thought soars tracklessly and far : The pale cheek on the pillow , and the pulse Of the sad silent heart , made deathlier only By thought in which their faintness has no share ! Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : TO CHARLES ROUX , OF SWITZERLAND . ( WRITTEN IN HIS ALBUM WHEN HE WAS THE AUTHOR 'S TEACHER IN MODERN LANGUAGES , YALE COLLEGE , 1827. ) from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , if I were thou  --  That glorious land of mountain and of flood , Whereon is graven God . As if its hills were chosen for Earth 's brow , And its loud torrents gave the words he spoke , Leaping from rock to rock . I would not leave it  --  for its children gave Their blood like water , for a word , " be FREE ! " Their last breath , " Liberty ! " Till Switzerland was made a mighty grave  --  A land where heroes like a harvest fell  --  The land of William Tell . I would not leave it :  --  yet the holy wing Of freedom shadoweth this land , as thine ! And when I call it " mine , " I make myself greater than a king . We welcome freemen  --  and we welcome thee  --  Dwell with us , and BE FREE ! Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : THE THOUGHT ANGEL . A WAKING AND SLEEPING DREAM . from The poems ( 1864 ) Night is the sick man 's day , For the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weary hours ; but , with the hush Of midnight , my last memory of pain Behold , all calmly with it , on the cloud , Rode a wing 'd angel with an open book ; And  --  of the hearts it moved  --  and of the dreams , Passions , and hopes it call 'd on as it flew  --  Of all it gave a voice to , that had else Slumber 'd unutter 'd in the Thought-ruled world  --  That angel kept a record . " Thou , hereafter , " Said a voice near me , " shalt that record hear ; For , in thy using of that gift of power , Speeding WHAT Thought THOU WILT ACROSS THE WORLD , Thou speak'st with the pervading voice of God , And , as thy sway of the world 's heart , will be The reckoning with thy Maker . Human Thought , Oh poet , lightly may take wondrous wings . Thy careless link binds words to travel far . But oh , take heed !  --  for see  --  by dream-revealing  --  How Thoughts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pen that writes Their history for Heaven ! " The sun shone in Upon my wind-stirr 'd curtains , and I woke . And this had been a dream . ' T is sometimes so :  --  We dream ourselves what we have striven to be , And hear what had been well for us to hear , Did our dreams shadow what we are . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : DESPONDENCY IN SPRING . from The poems ( 1864 ) Beautiful robin ! with thy feathers red Contrasting , flower-like , with the soft green tree , Making thy little flights , as thou art led By things that tempt a simple one like thee . I would that thou couldst warble me to tears As lightly as the birds of other years ! Idly to lie beneath an April sun , Pressing the perfume from the tender grass ; To watch a joyous rivulet leap on With the clear tinkle of a music glass , And , as I saw the early robin pass , To hear him through his little compass run  --  Only with joys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more know . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : SPRING . from The poems ( 1864 ) " L'onda del mar divisa Bagna la valle e l'monte , Va passegiera In flume , Va prigionera In fonte , Mormora sempre e geme Fin che non torna al mar . " Metastasio . The Spring is here  --  the delicate-footed May , With its slight fingers full of leaves and flowers , And with it comes a thirst to be away , In lovelier scenes to pass these sweeter hours , A feeling like the worm 's awakening wings , Wild for companionship with swifter things . We pass out from the city 's feverish hum , To find refreshment in the silent woods ; And nature , that is beautiful and dumb , Like a cool sleep upon the pulses broods  --  Yet , even there , a restless thought will steal , To teach the indolent heart it still must feel . Strange , that the audible stillness of the noon , The waters tripping with their silver feet , The turning to the light of leaves in June @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange  --  that they fill not , with their tranquil tone , The spirit , walking in their midst alone . There 's no contentment in a world like this , Save in forgetting the immortal dream ; We may not gaze upon the stars of bliss , That through the cloud-rifts radiantly stream ; Bird-like , the prison 'd soul will lift its eye And pine till it is hooded from the sky . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : BIRTHDAY IN A FOREIGN ISLE . from The poems ( 1864 ) ' T is the day my mother bore her son ! She has thought since morn of her absent one . At break of day she remember 'd me With trembling lip and bended knee ; And , at the hour of morning prayer , She has fix 'd her eye on the empty chair ; And , as my father bow 'd to pray , For one much loved and far away , My mother 's heart was stirr 'd anew , And tears have gush 'd her fingers through ; And with moving lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mother ! dear mother ! I 've wander 'd long , And must wander still , in these lands of song . My cheek is burnt with eastern suns ; My boyish blood more tamely runs : My speech is cold , my bosom seal 'd ; My once free nature check 'd and steel 'd ; I have found the world so unlike thee ; I have been so forced a rock to be ; It has froze my heart !  --  of my mother only , When the hours are sad , in places lonely  --  Only of thee  --  does a thought go by That leaves a tear in my weary eye : I see thy smile in the clouded air ; I feel thy hand in my wind-stirr 'd hair ; I hear thy voice , with its pleading tone , When else I had felt in the world alone  --  So alone , that there seem 'd to be Only my mother ' twixt heaven and me ! Mother ! dear mother ! the feeling nurst As I hung at thy bosom , clung round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love 's warm chain ; ' T is the only one that will long remain ; And as , year by year , and day by day , Some friend still trusted drops away , Mother ! dear mother ! oh , dost thou see How the shorten 'd chain brings me nearer thee ! Malta , Jan. 20 , 1834 . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : THE BROKEN BRACELET . from The poems ( 1864 ) ' T was broken in the gliding dance , When thou wert in thy dream of power , When lip and motion , smile and glance Were lovely all  --  the belle 's bright hour . The light lay soft upon thy brow , The music melted in thine ear , And one , perchance forgotten now , With ' wilder 'd thoughts , stood musing near , Marvelling not that links of gold A pulse like thine had not controll 'd . ' T is midnight now  --  the dancers gone  --  And thou in thy rich dreams asleep ; And I , awake , am gazing on The fragments given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That ran beneath these links of gold , And wonder if a thrill of pain Made those bright channels ever cold ! With gifts like thine , I can not think Grief ever chill 'd this broken link . Good night ! ' t is little now to thee That in my ear thy words were spoken , And thou will think of them , and me , As long as of the bracelet broken . And thus is riven many a chain That thou hast fasten 'd but to break , And thus thou'lt sink to sleep again , As careless if another wake ; The only thought thy heart can rend Is  --  what the fellow 'll charge to mend . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : TO JULIA GRISI , AFTER HEARING HER IN " ANNA BOLENA. " from The poems ( 1864 ) When the rose is brightest , Its bloom will soonest die ; When burns the meteor brightest , ' Twill vanish from the sky . If Death but wait until delight O'errun the heart , like wine , And break the cup when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd to-night The last drop into mine . Willis , Nathaniel Parker , 1806-1867 : REVERIES . AN EARLY POEM . from The poems ( 1864 ) I am an eldest son . My years Have been like golden moments nursed ; And if I ever wept , my tears From gentle fountains , gently burst . My mother 's kiss came with my prayer ; My father 's blessing with my sleep ; My sister 's words like music were , And how could I have learn 'd to weep ? I did not  --  and have worn a brow Of sunshine , even until now . Love comes to such like nature 's law , As waters swelling to a gush ; And thus , if light or life I saw , My feelings to their source would rush . A sunny leaf , a flitting shade , A tint of autumn , moonlight , aught By which this glorious world is made So beautiful , my spirit caught  --  And thrilling pleasure , and strange power To love and to be blest rushed by , And I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd to die . You well might deem that I should look On coming days , as looks the sun On leaf and tree , and find the book Of nature seem a brilliant one . Like him I look 'd upon the side The light in my own eye made bright ; And ever found the shadows glide Like guilty spirits from my sight . What marvel then that I should build The dreams this loitering tale would tell , Of light , and that my thought should gild The airy elements too well ?
