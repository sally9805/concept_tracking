txt The Enquirer , of this city , has a pretended Washington dispatch , describing a flank movement of the column of Gen. BANKS from Harper 's Ferry and Sandy Hook , and the occupation of the Ferry by the rebels ? and the passage of the Potomac by Gen. JOHNSTON 'S forces . The following is the dispatch to the Etzquirer alluded to above . It is dated at Washington , Aug. 21 : " Information has been received here to-day that leaves no room for doubt that BANNS ' column has made a flank movement from Harper 's Ferry and Sandy Hook . A gradual concentration of troops in the ' neighborhood of Monocacy was followed by a general movement of the Army , and by noon of Satuntay not a tent or a soldier was to be seen in or about Sandy Hook . The pickets were withdrawn from Harper 's Ferry on Thursday night , and the rebels in squads immediately entered the town . The fact that they immediately exchanged shots across the river , indicating the presence of a considerable force there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost before our pickets had reached the Maryland shore , shows that they were kept fully informed of our movements by the spies , Which they undoubtedly manage to keep within the National lines in spite of all precautions . One thing is very certain , however , that the general movement of the Army was kept profoundly secret from its own officers , few of whom knew that it was to take place . The rebel Army , it is asserted , crossed the Potomac last night in force , notwithstanding the high stage of the river was supposed to be a check upon such a movement . This bold and reckless course of Gen. jOHNSTON is remarkable , as it divides his forces , and places in his rear a wide river to hinder his retreat , which is certain to take place . Gen. SCOTT and Gen. McCLELLAN will meet the occasion , for which they arc fully prepared . BALTIMORE , Thursday , Aug. 22 . From information , believed to be reliable . there is good warrant for saying that the report of Gen. JOHNSTON crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO HAVE ADVANCED TO WINCHESTER . PHILADELPHIA , Thursday , Aug. 22 . Private information from Gen. BANKS ' column says he had advanced to Winchester and taken possession , notwithstandinithe opposition of 4,000 rebels . THE MOVEMENT TO MONOCACY . Correspondence of the Washington Star . POINT OF ROOKS , Monday , Aug. 19 , 1961 . EntToR STAR The whole of Gen. BANKS ' command has left Sandy Hook , and will encamp for the time being near the mouth of the Monocacy River on the Potomac . The rebel pickets occupied Harper 's Ferry last night . There was firing by pickets across the river , and it is said two of the rebels were killed . The work upon the bridge is suspended . It wanted but two spans to complete it . The impression is that JOHNETON will move this way in force . He will get a hot reception . It is possible that as Harper 's Ferry is not occupied , and but one regiment at Sandy Hook , they may turn their attention that way . As we occupy the railroad not far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be made . There is reliable information here that the enemy is concentrated at Leesburgh , some thousands strong , with field pieces . The cool weather and the approach of September will soon bring on movemeets in this region , and we should not be surprised if ** column will soon he in active work . lie is a man of excellent judgment , and all have confidence in him . All well and in good spirits , and want to see JOHNSTON .
