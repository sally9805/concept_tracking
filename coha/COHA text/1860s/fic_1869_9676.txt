Main text By a sailor boy , returned from sea , and his brother , from school . WILLIAM .  --  Advancing with interest , and taking both his hands . Robert , Robert ! Is it possible ! ROBERT .  --  Aye , Willie boy , Robert it is  --  your own Robin Hood as you loved to call me , when we ranged the wild woods after squirrels , and climbed the tall hickery 's to share with them their nuts . WILLIAM .  --  Yes , I see your dimple , now you smile . I could pick you out of a thousand little sailor boys , Robin ; but how glad I am to see you  --  glad , indeed , to feel these rough sailors hands in mine . Good-naturedly shaking both his hands ROBERT .  --  Aye , rough they are , for they have seen rough times ; but you know nothing about being glad . You must let me say that , for how I have longed for home , and would have given worlds , were they mine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a land of strangers . Home is home , Willie , be it ever so homely ; and although I had but a poor prospect in looking that way , yet I could not help wishing to see you , and mother , and little Jeanette , even though it were in a poor-house , for I felt it would even then comfort my broken-hearted mother only to see me , for it would come sweetly over my mind how poor mother and Jeanette , when they petted me , called me their " little Robin . " WILLIAM .  --  Sweet Robin , you know it was ; but no matter for the bygones now  --  you do n't know what good news I have for you . ROBERT .  --  Good news ! I wonder which of the four winds can ever blow fair for Bob Luckless , as the sailor called me  --  for things would go wrong  --  I could not help it . No wonder , Willie , when my heart was all the while away with you ; but when they taunted me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of home now ; " I would add , " Avast , you little lubber , with your love knots ! " but it was all true , for I would be blurred with tears , hardly knowing what I was about . WILLIAM .  --  But you do n't ask about your father , Robert . ROBERT .  --  Oh , brother ! I feared , I feared to touch that subject  --  is he then dead ? WILLIAM  --  No , Robin Hood , he is alive from the dead . Embracing him with feeling . We have a home , now , and a father , too . Yes , we have a father indeed , and no broken-hearted mother now . ROBERT .  --  Can it be true , Willie ? Taking his hand , and looking earnestly at him . Was it not too much to hope for ? What ! is all prosperous and happy again , and have I come in right good season to fill up my mother 's cup of joy ? WILLIAM  --  Yes , Robin ; and we are back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mills . ROBERT .  --  Bought the mills ? WILLIAM .  --  And the meadow , and the orchard , and the mountain lot , where the mill-pond is . ROBERT .  --  What ! the ' Squire 's , where we used to skate ? Stony Creek meadow , too  --  what ! all that ? WILLIAM .  --  Yes , yes , all father 's now ; and Jeanette and I go to school in the village , and have a good time , and mother has the neatest dairy in the country . Mother do n't look pale and sad any more ; and Robin , you would n't know father , now  --  no , not at all . ROBERT .  --  Happy change ! And is all this in store for Bob Luckless ? But tell me , Willie , what has worked this world of wonders ? WILLIAM .  --  Sit down here , and I will tell you all , that we may rejoice together at the return of the wanderer  --  not so much you , dear Robin , but our poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found again . ROBERT .  --  That we will rejoice , for I think lightly of my troubles past , to reach at last so pleasant a port as a peaceful home  --  but quick , come , tell me all ! WILLIAM .  --  Well , you remember that dreadful stormy night in October , in which we parted by the big maple-tree at the mill-race , after father turned you out ? ROBERT .  --  Oh , Willie ! do n't talk of that now , for my heart bleeds afresh . It must have been a bitter night of troubles for my mother . How often have I heard her say , " I have no comfort , if not in my children . " But it is past now . WILLIAM .  --  That night , as you know , you went down to Uncle Jones 's schooner in the bay . ROBERT .  --  Yes , and he received me kindly ; and before midnight , with a running gale , we were on the broad ocean . It was a stormy night . WILLIAM . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robin ; for when mother and little Jeanette grieved after you , father beat them , and thrust them both out in that dreadful storm . I stood in the door-way ; they reached the bottom of the hill , and mother fell exhausted ; then I heard Rover whine , who , poor dog , had followed them as a faithful friend . Returning to the room , all was dark . Father 's tempest of rage had past  --  he was asleep , stretched on the floor . I snatched a few things , closed the doors , and ran with fearful haste to the foot of the hill . ROBERT .  --  And poor mother ?  --  WILLIAM .  --  Had fainted ; and I could not drag little Jeanette away from her . I hastened to neighbor Burns 's , and returned with him , found poor Rover , trembling and whining , stretched across them both , as if to keep off the cold storm . Neighbor Burns kindly brought us all to his house . ROBERT .  --  Good neighbor Burns ! I knew he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his reward in the pleasure of doing it . WILLIAM .  --  The old house was stripped of everything next day ; father was taken quite ill , to the county poor-house . Mother was some days before she could be moved , and she could follow him , saying to us , " Father shall not want for kind nursing in his sickness . " Jeanette and I would not be parted from her , so we all went , and mother nursed him . He was in a few months restored . The winter was severe ; I went to work at neighbor Burns 's , earned a little daily , and got some comforts for mother , so hope again smiled on us.  --  But do n't you remember , Robin , the little society down at Warwick ? ROBERT .  --  What , the little cold water company ? Yes , I do  --  I always thought it a good plan for peace and comfort . WILLIAM .  --  Well , Charles Wilson spent the holidays at neighbor Burns 's . He brought a little green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed a society there . I got a box , too , like Charles 's , copied his papers , and got ever so many names , and almost persuaded father , too , for he seemed quite weaned from drink . And he did sign at last , as I will soon tell you ; and I believe it has saved him and many others from ruin . When father seemed himself again , we went back to the farm house , got a few things together with the help of our neighbors , and we thought all would go well again ; but the storm blew back again , and father joined his old companions , and was worse than ever . ROBERT .  --  Ah , Willie ! that 's the way it is at sea . The storm and wind lulls for awhile , then the tempest bursts with redoubled fury , tearing all to pieces .  --  But poor mother ? WILLIAM .  --  Oh , then she was truly broken-hearted . Hope seemed forever fled . Little Jeanette pined away . At last , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Jeanette , it sorely grieved my mother . You know , Robin , father always favored me for I was named after him , and I often persuaded him home , and he would for awhile seem ashamed and sorry ; but then again , he would be as hard-hearted as ever , and care for nothing . ROBERT .  --  And what , after all , could win him back ? WILLIAM .  --  There was a soft place in his almost seared conscience , Robin , and it was touched at the right time . At the close of one of our long tedious days of suffering , mother was wasting away with grief and want , when father had been from home since the night before . I went in search of him , and then , at a late hour of the night , he was among the wicked crowd . I glided close to him , unnoticed . He was reaching his hand to the counter , and something dropped from it to the floor . It was bright and shining , and I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROBERT .  --  What ! mother 's gold ring she used to weep over when she talked of the good times when she first put it on ? WILLIAM .  --  It was , Robert . I suddenly took father 's hand , looked him kindly in the face , and with a trembling heart , cried " Oh , father , ' T is mother 's gold ring ! " He was for a moment overcome  --  I led him , weeping , to the door . He was quite himself . We walked silently and sadly home . I told mother what had happened , and and she was strengthened to talk to him . She lifted up her feeble hands to heaven , praying for a blessing on those penitent tears , and those earnest promises . Father seemed as one returning to his senses  --  was gentle and mild spoken . I ran to my little green box for my temperance pledge , that had all our names on but his , and I said , " Come , father let us all be alike , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , a whole family in heaven . " With a trembling hand , he signed ; then mother , putting the ring on his finger , said , " This shall be a seal of remembrance , William ; look on it , and forgot the past . " He then renewed his promises , and what a thankful hour it was , that first hour of peace and rest that mother had known for years . Father was as good as his word , and started next morning early , and threshed all day at neighbor Burns 's , and brought his wages to mother at night . Oh , that was a thanksgiving supper , sweetened by the tears of mutual joy and words of peace ; and scanty it was , how truly refreshing , as we experienced how true was the Bible saying , " Better is a dry morsel and a dinner of herbs where love is , than a stalled ox and hatred therewith . " ROBERT .  --  And has all gone straight since that  --  no breakers or head winds , Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went daily with him to watch him and pick up a little work with him ; and never but once did he turn out of the way by temptation , and then I quickly took his hand , and pointed to the shining treasure on his finger , said , " See father ; do n't forget mother 's gold ring . " It was enough ; and now it is two years since , and these have been two years of joy and blessing . Father 's earnings , and mother 's , and sometimes mine , soon laid up a little bank for us ; we got a cow , and bought the Stony Brook meadow lot ; then one piece of furniture after another brightened up our little cottage ; the old place began to lift up its head as fast as its master did . The singing birds seemed to rejoice in its groves , and the grass looked greener than ever , and the flowers , two , were sweeter now . Father was at last able to lift the mortage , and bring all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , and all we sighed for was Robin Hood . Kindly taking his hand . ROBERT .  --  And that sigh shall be hushed to-night , for I will add one more gladdened heart to the happy family , and give another name to the temperance paper in your little green box , and then all the family , as you say , will indeed be one . WILLIAM .  --  What a happy day for all of us and that happiness built on temperance ! Only last night it was , when Jeanette lisped your name . " Yes , poor Robin ! " said mother ; " if he was but here , what more could I wish for ? My cup of bliss would then be full . " ROBERT .  --  So it shall be full and overflowing , too . Mother has all her wishes , and shall sigh no more , and shall never want in days to come , if Robin , the sailor boy , is still spared to her . I have heard wonderful stories , Willie , on the seas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings in fairy tales , but nothing like the story of Hopewell farm ; and no ring like my mother 's gold ring ; and no paper of promise to pay , or payment of sealed deed , like the temperance paper in your little green box , sealed with the tears of penitence and promises of reform . The fame of it shall spread far and wide , wherever Robin the sailor boy goes ; and no champion among the knights or giants shall be braver than he in the cause of temperance ,  --  or this is not your own Robin Hood who shakes you with his rough hand , Willie , boy . And you shall give me the little green box with the parchments therein , and every voyage I 'll bring it home a yard longer . WILLIAM .  --  Then you 'll be my own Robin Hood , and mother 's own sweet Robin once again . ROBERT .  --  Yes , for when I tell the sad , joyful tale of Hopewell farm , I can show father 's trembling signature on the paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch every heart , and the temperance cause shall always gain by the story of my mother 's gold ring . WILLIAM .  --  So it shall , Robin , for it is a magic ring , indeed . It has healed the broken-hearted , transformed a brute into a man , turned a husband to a loving wife , a father to his children , made a sorrowful house a home of joy and thanksgiving , and has blessed all it touched . ROBERT .  --  And the truth of it has touched me , too , Willie , so I shall hoist the temperance flag wherever I sail , teaching the sons of the briny deep to love fresh water as they do the waves of their own salt sea , and I trust I shall see the day when many a little green temperance box shall be stowed away in the sailor 's till , or the captain 's locker , for honest tars are too generous not to give to any cause that will bring relief or comfort to the afflicted , and deliverance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like a little fairy along lane the to the happy farm-house , now to be gladder than ever . WILLIAM .  --  Come then , Robin , my sailor boy . Taking his hand . Let us all sail with this happy breeze of joy into the pleasant port of a temperance home .
