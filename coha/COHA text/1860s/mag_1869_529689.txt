txt CO-OPERATIVE HOUSEKEEPING . V. KNOWLPDGE AND PRUDENCE MUST BE THE STRENG . I OF WOMANHOOD SUFFRAGE . J N a preceding number of this series I surmLed that co-operative housekeeping would so accustom women to act together , and so bring them into direct relations with the eager and powerful world of men , that they would find it nec*s*ary , for their protection and advancement , to maintain representative a*semblies of their own sex , who could fulfil in the state the same persuasive office that every woman does now in the family for herself and her daughters , - plead for the feminine interests and happiness against the involuntary but en*Tro sing selfishness of men . I have said that the feminine vote could express , by its very nature , opinion only , not power , and therefore that its real strength ( as well as , in my judgment , its glory ) would be in its coming before the world simply in its true character of the Collective Wo man 's Voice . For then , perhaps , while men were ruling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard instructing them how ; but were its soft tones , its delicate accents , to be mingled with their fierce shouts in war or their hoarse political cries in peace , surely they would be utterly lost . There is no weakness so fatally weak as pretension . If men not only voted us the vote , - if they voted every vote of ours to count five of theirs , - what would it avail us if some day they voted to take it away again ? So I am against this making of treaties and defining of rights between the all-powerful and the all-weak . Like the international relation between the United States and the Indians , it could only be a sham and a mockery , a political lie , and therefore containing the seeds of political disease and death . Let us have some self-respect . We have not tried yet to influence the world as women ; why , then , should we demandto do it as men ? Should the former fail , it will 286 March , // 1869. be time then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexes is not that men have " rights " and women have none . It is that men are organized among themselves while women are not , and the very fact that we are begging them for rights shows that they are not rights at all , but favors . Therefore I would rather take my stand on that which , as they have not given , so they could hardly take away , - on the solidarity of our sex , - on the moral weight of a united womaniwod . And , in truth , is there not brute force enough in the world already ? Why should we aspire to be the governing power of society instead of its ameliorating influence ? Too long has that or , obstinate traveller , Humanity , been blown upon by the gusts of arrogant authority from this quarter and from that . Let us try , rather , what the sweet sunshine of truth can do with him . Smiling , let us hold up a mirror before his passion-ploughed and tearstained face , instead of clamoring for a seat among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image of his Creator , - for so shall we make him much more anxious to fashion himself after the Divine beauty . Some such gentle and gracious attitude as this , it seems to me , would better befit women in rebard to public - affairs , than that actual taking sides and fighting in the battles of the political arena , to which the exercise of manhood suffra*e would compel us . Should we ever assume it , however , we should never lose sight of the fact that our feminine legislatures , having no material force to back them , and pretending to no authority , must rest all their hopes of respect and influence upon the excellence of their sug*estions . Their functions in the world - will be mainly those of advice and criticism , - two things that men hate so mortally from women , that , unless the advice b* wise , and the criticism temperate , we may be sure that they will not listen to us ; or if , heeding us , we persuade them into a mistake , that their contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore , our legislatures will need on many topics all the enlightenment they can gain . Wisdom does not come by instinct to women any more than to men . It grows by knowledge and experience , and in order that the sex may possess it , may understand what it is about when it attempts to influence the law-making power , the co-operative housekeepers w*ild do well to encourage the few among them who are fitted for such pursuits to devote their attention to the principles and problems of jurisprudence , and of the other studies whose objects are the regulation and happiness of humanity . - The CouncilHall should be the centre of our palace , but communicating with it must be the Courts of Law and the Bureaus of Charity , of Medicine , and of Education . LAW . It may seem the last outrage of strong - minded - femaleism to suggest that women should study and practise law ; since , though there have been stray members of the sex in almost every other masculine profession , no one of them has yet invaded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say nothing of the daughter of the Italian professor who was s* learned in the law that she used to lecture to her father 's students for him , and so beautiful that she had to sit behind a screen lest they should ponder her face more than her instruction , still , every little while , one hears of some *voman whose determination , acuteness , and technical knowledge have The late petition of some New York women in the case of Hester Vaughan , so coldly received by the governor of Pennsylvania , so severely commented upon by the press , is a case in point of how well-weighed any public request by women should be , in order to have effect . Such hasty and ill-judged acts will not be frequent , however , when those who really *-e*reseuf lire sex shall deliberate for it . Enthusiasts , acting from their own impulses , are very diffemut from the well-informed and responsible ma*ons , who , I hope , will one day speak for their fellows , when their general or individual inteiwats require it . The part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not by a sporadic mistake like this , hut by the long , steady , faithful , yet unobtrusive work of the women of the Sanitary Com-mission , // brought her off first-best in some legal battle , even against the most desperate odds . Such a case is that of the celebrated Mrs. Gaines , now in such honorable possession of her immense property ; and if women without a regular legal training can so well help themselves , it is probable that they could with that training help each other . I have known the daughters of lawyers who seemed to me fitted for nothing but the law themselves , and as every co-operative housekeeping association must have a lawyer to keep it from getting into trouble , I think , though no doubt every one will laugh at the suggestion , that its members might do worse than employ one of their own sex in that capacity. * When , too , women prepare measures fot recommendation to the State legislatures or to Congress , they might present as sorry a figure as the legislators do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the actual working of old statutes , and of the probable working of new ones . Who will instruct women in the law , however , I can not guess , for if it has been such a struggle for a few of them to gain a medical education , when the care of the sick is so naturally a feminine occupation , what would it be in the case of this profession , - the immemorial prerogati ( *e of men ? j CHARITY . Justice has so much to learn from mercy , that , next to a knowledge of the law , women have most need of large illumination on the subject of charity and reform . Our generosity is now so thoughtless and unsystematic , our sympathy so shallow , sentimental , and even silly , that it is to be feared much of it is no better than thrown away . But co-operative housekeeping could change * I understand it to be now not uncommon in large firms for one of the partners either to be a lawyer , or to study law as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this , not only in order to save the expense of lawyer 's fees to the company , but also because great sums are often lost for want of due legal knowledge beforehand . t Since writing she above , I see by the papers that a young lady l ? as just been admitted as a student into the Law School of Washington College , St. Louis . all this by organizing in every society a charitable department , and giving it in charge to that woman of the association ( and there is always one such in every circle ) who takes more interestin the poor , and knows more about them , than any other person . Then , instead of each housekeeper 's giving foolishly away at the door , or to her servants , subscribing at haphazard to this wise or that wasted charity , she couldsend all she had to bestow of food or clothing or money to the general Aln*oner . XVomen of like sympathies with herself would naturally cluster about her ( if our churches were rightly organized , they would he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community there would he a compact working body , ready to suggest and carry out the best methods for the relief and reform of all the poor and degraded of the neighborhood . If they found their means and powers inadequate for their designs , they could lay the case before the townmeeting , when , perhaps , it would occur to the tax-payers that , after all , the cheapest and most efficient overseers of the poor might be found among Christian ladies Is it not likely that the sexes together could devise a better plan for the relief of lowly misery than the almshouse system , - so cold , so hard , so distasteful to the poor as it is , and therefore so inadequate to the work it undertakes ? HEALTH . After what I have already said about the responsibilities of women in regard to the study and practice of medicine , it follows that I should hope to see a great stimulus given to it by co-operative housekeeping ; for then , if any woman possessed a peculiar gift for it , the association could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her until she had received a regular medical training , and was qualified to be put in charge of the health department . Should she , out of respect to the r*ident physicians , decline to practise medicine , still she will have a noble function in the prevention of disease // and physical deterioration , and in the assisting of physical development . She will keep a strict eye on everything that goes out of the kitchen and clothing-house , to see that nothing injurious to health , either in food or clothing , be ignorantly adopted by the community , and that whatever is necessary to bodily well-being and beauty be in constant use in every family . Defective teeth , thin hair , pale cheeks , flat and narrow chests , spindling legs and arms , boniness and wrinkles instead of roundness and dimples , - all this melanch oly physical deficiency that h aunts society and makes home unhappy , exists because we do not know how to live physically ; because we are ignorant what elements should preponderate in food and drink , in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we do not make our own and our children 's muscular development in gymnasium and in the open air a solemn duty , or care what hours we keep , and what injurious customs we follow . The judicious head of the health clepartm ent will , however , gradually change all this ; and when the new generation grows up she will point with pride to the blooming Hebes and Junos alkabout as the just results of her enlightened physical teaching . Even before the children are born , she will watch over the expectant mothers , that the formation of the new human beings may go on with every favorable concurrence ; and I suppose that in this connection a mass of phenomena is waiting to be studied by acute and experienced doctresses , of which the medical world little dreams . Another function of the co-operative doctress would be the trainin of her staff of nurses . It is in sickness , indeed , that perhaps co - operative housekeeping would shine the brightest . Some of these nurses will , no doubt , be ladies who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be well if each congregation represented in the association could have one or two of such Nursing Sisters , as they might be called , trained and ready to their pastor 's need . The pillow of many a poor sufferer is stuffed with thorns , as she reflects on the dirt and waste that m* y be running riot down stairs in her absence , or on the discomfort that may be added to the anxieties of the husband whom she loves . In co-operation , however , neither sickness nor health would make any difference in the clock-like workings of the great domestic machine . The Sisters would be trained not only in nursing , but in family management and the care of children , so that in case no relative of a sick mother could be called upon , her little ones would still be attended to . And I really think one angelic office of the co-operative kitchen would be the preparation of food for the sick . What exquisite delicacies would be sent in to tempt the fainting appetite What xvines and cordials would there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grev better , how easy to give her the needed daily ride in the carriage that would be kept by the association especially for its inva-lids EDUCATION . A kindred and indeed necessarily associate spirit with the heads of the charitable and health departments will be the president of the co-operative boards of education . This lady will probably be chosen for her luminous mind and extensive reading , and all the women teachers within the circle of the association , and all who have been teachers , will sit on the board with her . Their duty will be to discuss text-books , the methods of study , the systems and requirements of schools , public and private , and to make known their conclusions to the mothers of the association . Then , at last , will our whole bloodless , heartless , soulless public-school system be brought before the bar of intelligent womanhood , and the sense or nonsense , the kindness or cruelty , of the re*ulations of the present school corn mittees criticised by those whom God made the natural // guardians and teachers of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in almost everything else , hut how it is possible that they have not seen the absolute necessity of placing them on school committees , I can not conceive . The consequence ts a routine so dry , mechanical , and one-sided , that it has got either to be wholly reformed or given up ; for better no national education at all , than one which disposes us to be only a race of cheating traders . The feminine board of education will also have to decide the scarcely less important question of how much lon6er girls are to be kept out of the universities , and , in case they ought to be admitted , in what manner and by what means the sex had best attempt to bring it about . For myself , I think that the offer by women of half a million of dollars to either Harvard , Yale , Michigan , or Cornell , as the price of our admission , should precede all appeal , argument , or protest in the matter . I can not echo the lofty tone of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university education , and that men have no " right " to keep them out of it . I really hope I shall live to see the day when the confusion of the American mind on the subject of " right " - one of the many baleful gifts of false France - is cleared up . How any one can have a right to a thing that he or she has never possessed , I can not imagine . I can maintain that a woman has a natural right to her life or her honor , because these are her original possessions from her Maker . So , too , a native-born , white American citizen has a right to vote , because it is an inheritance from his father , upon which he legally enters when he is twenty-one years of age . But no other person has a " natural right " to the American manhood suffrage , nor any right at all , until he acquire it by purchase , gift , or conquest from the supreme American authority . It is the same with education . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Worcester , Mass. , a lady was to he appointed a member of the School Committee . The world mo es . The whole realm of knowledge has been reclaimed and cultivated by men alone ; it is they who have founded and sustained the great institutions of learning . Certainly , then , they , and not we , have a " right " to say who shall enter them , and if we wish to reap intellectually where we have not sown , why should we not be willing to pay for the privilege what indeed would be but a trifling sum , comprtred with all that men have expended in the gigantic labor ? I would as soon think of demanding as a " right " that the miner , who with toil and struggle had hewn out the golden ore while I stood nerveless by , should halve it with me , as of claiming a right of entrance into the universities for women ; nay , sooner , by as much as wisdom is more precious than gold . Compared with education the vote is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our minds cramped and limited on every side by ignorance of the things we would so gladly have known , had we been permitted " to go to college . " But still we were deprived of a liberal education as much by the supineness of our own sex as by the illiberality of the other . Had women at large possessed any generous love of , or faith in , knowledge for its own sake , the rich among them might long ago have founded professorships and scholarships in the universities for the culture of the sex . As for the " female seminary , " and every development and outgrowth of it , I abhor it . To begin with , where can professors be obtained for it ? for there are no college-bred women , and men of the first rank will not accept the chairs in a " female college . " Even could they be found , however , the intellectual results of such an institution would be as unsatisfactory as are the present moral and aesthetical results of those composed exclusively of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not consist with the divorce of the sexes . In truth , it almost makes one laugh to see Haryard , for example , congratulating herself that she is now a " University , " // 1869 . Co-operative Housekeeping . when the curriculum of her studies is wanting in only about half of the circle of the arts and sciences , and when also she shuts out the best minds of half the human race . No university proper has ever yet existed or can exist , until every department of human knowledge is represented in it , and until mind is free to come there for culture as mind simply , and not as mind plus a particular sex . But to this noble end , since women would reap half the benefit , I would have women contribute to the utmost of their power . The Rochdale Pioneers always devote two per cent of their profits to education , and their example should be imitated by co-operative housekeepers , for so not only schools and colleges could be enriched , but individual cases of great talent stimulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered by the mothers of the community , we may hope that at last the most important of them all , - their fearful responsibility in regard to the morals of society , - may be brought home to them also , so that they will realize how much of the ruin of their own sex now wrought and handed on continually from one , set of young men to another is due to their own neglect of duty . It is too often the case that parents train their boys in every virtue save those of chastity and honor to the other sex . I have said that a great agent in reforming society would be the possibility and encouragement of early marriabe , and the demand of a higher morality from men than young girls now venture to make . But this is only the last half of the work . The first half must come from education , from early discipline . Mothers must teach their young sons to cortrol their selfish impulses , not only as regards theft , violence , lying , deceit , * But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have an existeucc , before attemptisig to enlarge the education of women . What rich woman will give ten thousand dollars toward half a million to be tendered to Harvard University , in case she will admit women to her examinations and degrees , and furnish tutors to prepare them ? Who will *4ve five hundred , one hundred , fifty , or even ten dollars to it ? drinking , the seeds of all of which can often be detected even in little children , but also in regard to that passion which , the most universal and now the most ungoverned of them all , causes more shame , misery , disease , and unspeakable agony , than all the rest of them put together . It seems almost incredible that , with the history of her own sex before her , with the crimes of society all about her , any mother can fail to fortify her son against temptation , or forbear to teach him to respect that womanhood of which she is to him the most sacred representative . So it is , how-ever ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , surely there is none comparable to this Finally , when all the women who crave , and who are worthy of , a liberal education have received it , teachin will not , as now , be limited to those who are obliged to follow it for a living whether they have capacity for it or not . Co-operative hofisekeeping would develop the principle of " natural selection " in this as ' in so many other feminine avocations . The woman who had the talent for it would undertake it , whether married or single , rich or poor , since , if she could teach better than she could superintend cooking or sewing , her fellow - housekeepers would find it for their highest interests even to entreat her to instruct their children . And what a great thing it would be for the manners and ambition of the young , could they feel that their teachers were always the social equals and honored friends of their parents ! The present disadvantage of the profession in this respect is immense . TUE PRESS . If co-operation , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in legislation , in charity , in medicine , in education , they will , of course , need journals wherein they can read news of each other . Then - do not forget , 0 housekeepers , to provide amonb the stately apartments of your edifice a modest sanctum for your editress . For r // if among your number you count a restless spirit with an irresistible desire to inaurrurate all possible and impossible reforms , from dusting the great organ in the Boston Music Hall ( and o how dusty it is ! ) to sweeping the cobwebs off the sky , be sure that she will try to give you an excellent newspaper , with a perfectly independent platform , with all the latest items you ought to know about , with all the good old principles , and all the new ideas , with no fear or favor shown to anybody nor any anonymous editorials , but with a decent respect " for the powers that be , " and a loyal recognition of truth and faithfulness wherever they be founc* Tsut ARTS . But our palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it so we must send also from their housexvifcry all the gifted feminiac artists we have , that they may carve the slender pillar and fling the graceful arch , pant the rich ceilings and inlay the mosaic borders ; while the music swells and falls , and the poetesses from their airy towers survey the wide world like the watching sistcr in the nursery tale , and tell of all the new hopes that appear on the hortzon . PAINTING . In co-operative housekeeping we shall all save so much money , and earn so much money , that we shall feel comparatively rich , and will raise our eyes to delights of which now we do not dream . Among others , we shall all want paintings on our walls and frescos on our ceilings ; then we must not let our feminine artists waste themselves on sewing , but persuade them to beautify our homes for us . Such artistic talent as is now buried in housekeeping ! Lest any should take fright at what has just been said , and 5U**05C that co-operative housekceping Would end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will quiet their fears by saying that by the census of x5*o , out of nearly six millions of male citizens , only about two hundred thousand were engaged in professional or other pursuits requiring education . At the very worst , therefore , not more than the same proportion of women wo*ild be called to forsake the traditional occupations of their *ex . Shall I ever forget my schoolmate , the tall and robust Jocunda ? - bubbling well of laughter and fun and good-nature , - who never had a bit of paper in her hand that it was not presently broad with caricature or tender and graceful with the sweetest little flower-thoughts of babies and fairies and angels and all imaginable ethereal feminine things . But she is married ! Women may never produce a Raphael , - but it is quite enough for me to look throurrh the exquisite illustrations of " The Story without an End , " by the Hon. Mrs. Boyle , an English lady , to know that women can not be spared from the world of art , - for these designs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have imagined them . Art associations among our women , painting and sketching clubs , proper notice and encouragement given to girlish talent , would eventually produce a feminine School of Art in America , as they have already done in England ,  --  but another instance among several which ought to humiliate us , of how much American women talk , and how much English women do . Whether it is that they have indeed more genius , or that so many of their gentlewomen are obliged to support themselves , or that so many of them being unmarried , they are forced into selfdevelopment for want of occupation , I know not ; but certain it is , that while the mass of En*lish women strike Americans as tame and conventional , most of the best work of the feminine world for the last twenty years has been done by them . SCULPTURE AND ARchITEcTuRE . For sculpture American girls seem to have an odd , independent sort of in*tinct , though they have not shown any strictly independent thought in it yet , that I know of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new direction will at first be servile , if not weak , copies of the masculine models . But when women have fairly learned to use their xvings , they will shape their flight for themselves , discover their own truths , draw their own conclusions , conceive 292 March , // their own ideals , - a proposition which I consider proven by the history of the English feminine novel , which , beginfling with the gross masculine imitations of Mrs. Aphara Behn , after a proress ive development of two hundred years is now apparently culminating in the magnificent achievements of George Eliot , - a writer so extraordinary that she sits alone , while there is only one , perchance unattainable , height to which any future woman may ever soar above her . But if American girls are trying sculpture , no woman of us all , I believe , has attempted architecture , which is strange ; for little girls often find the greatest amusement in making groundplans on the slate , and ladies frequently suggest the whole idea of their houses to the architect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in carrying it out . So , whetheP they would ever aspire to cathedrals or not , I am sure women would succeed in planning the loveliest and completest of homes . Houses without any kitchens and " backyards " in them ! Ho*v fascinating ! Think how much more beautiful city ar*hitecture will now be ! The houses , instead of being built round a square , could be set in the middle of it , with only an alley-*vay for ventilation , and grasses , trees , and flowers all about the outside . Every tenth block would contain the kitchen and laundry and clothin ( *-h ou and for these domestic purb * poses the Oriental style could be adopted , of interior court-yards with fountains and grass , secluded from the street . Should not this also be the plan for all the public - school build-ings ? HORTICULTURE . With their unlifriited passion for flowers , and their universal success in cultivating them , *vhy is it that women never have any floral societies ? How ugly our streets and roadsides are , too , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted there ! and alas , how expensive fruit is ! It is said that the English ladies are many of them great florists and botanists , and also practical farmers , so that they understand thoroughly the management of their estates and gardens . Should co-operative housekeeping have that effect upon farming which I have before indicated , I trust American women will begin to imitate their English cousins in these respects . Are we never to begin to prepare the earth for the coming of the Lord ? To think that one small sect of semi-Christians only , - the Shakers , - out of all the millions of Christendom , should cherish this beautiful hope , and put a part of their religion into every tree they plant and every field they sow ! When , indeed , is the wilderness going to blossom as the rose ? At least , let us set our feminine civilization in the midst of grass and flowers , of vines *nd trees , so that even every humble home may be adorned , and every table spread with " all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " MUSIC ANI ) TILE DRAMA . Music is an angel from heaven which should dwell in every household . Then the best amateurs of the associaton must devise how to get and keep her there , - must observe the musical talent in the young , and have it properly trained by means of thorough teachers , choral societies , amateur concerts and operas in every community . I can not express what exquisite musical capacity I have known remain undeveloped through the ignorance or indifference of parents ,  --  what players , what 5mbers , lost ! And , on the other hand , I suppose no estimate can be made of the money sunk in trying to teach music to those who can not learn it ; for it is one of the most complicated and difficult of arts , and not one parent in twenty-five knows whether her children are succeeding in it or not . The true plan would be to give each child in the community a certain amount of careful elementary instruction , after which it should be examined by a competent musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Co-operativc Hozisckeepi ; zg. of the case , and thus save them either from ignorantly flinging away a jewel , or from trying to make one out of a pebble. * Finally , when all other women are earning their living , I trust it will no longer be considered derogatory for a " lady " to sing or play for money . If God creates an exceptional voice for the joy of multitudes , what is to be said of the conventionality that confines the magnificent tones to the limits of a fashionable drawing-room ? I knew a glorious song-bird , that , from the farthest heights of the musical empyrean , might have ravished a listening world . She floods her gilded cage with melody ; but does it fill her yearning heart ? Still she is but a slave where she might have been a queen . A great gift for acting stands in the same category with a great voice . Both should be used for the delight of mankind , and for the benefit of its possessor . I never see the refined and brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who rehearse together only a few weeks , and play together only a few times , without thinking what a pity it is that the stage is not a pure and honorable calling , and the dramatic talent not yet reco0nized as one implanted by the Creator to be developed for his glory and for human happiness as much as any other . I believe Brigham Young 's theory and practice on this point the true one ; and , humiliating as it may be to learn anything from a Mormon , yet , since Christianity can not keep people away from the theatre , had it not better go there itself ? Would the guilty intrigue be represented , the coarse joke applauded , the immodest dance tolerated , if good and noble men and women organized For the sake of giving honor where honor is due , ii will say that , with the beautiful natural voices of our country , it will be a shame if we do not erelong produce a supreme irima do e* for we have now among us one of the great singing-teachers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who has achieved an exhaustive study of the human voice , and completed the most perfect theory of the vocal art ever attempted .

At all events , I believe , with Mrs. Stowe , that the experiment is worth trying . A true civilization should overlook none of the marked tendencies of humanity ; and should women ever form associations among themselves for the higher culture of other aesthetic branches , I hope they will by no means leave out the drama .

And what shall be the golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a splendid society , presided over by ladies famous for their beauty , their wit , or their tact , where every graceful element of human achievement may have free play , and every kindly impulse of human feeling full encouragement , because none " look on their own things , but all look also on the things of others . " I confess I fear it is not to exist on this side of the New Jerusalem . For a perfect society is one wherein every personcomposing it is fitly placed ; whereas in such a world of inequalities in wealth , in attractiveness , in pride , in culture , it is difficult to get more than half a dozen persons together who feel precisely on the same footing . Still , it is to be hoped that not then the women whose husbands have the most money , but the wise and stately matrons who are at the head of the cooperative kitchen , of the sewing-house , of the charitable and other departments , will be in some sort the acknowledged social leaders ; for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to society abroad , - a recognized standard of fine manners to which young people would be expected to conform .

THE RELIGIOUS ASPECT OF THE FEMININE CIVILIZATION . The plan of our palace is complete . There is a place in it for every feminine power , and scope for every feminine aspiration . " But is there to be no hallowed shrine within our walls ? " some deep , religious heart may ask ; " no solemn sanctuary wherein we alone may gather together to worship God ?

I myself am an Episcopalian , and can not wonder enough that , when deaconesses were an integral part of the organization of that pure primitive Church which the Anglican Communion and her Amencan daughter pretend to take for their model , our clergy and bishops are so content to ignore the value of the patient and devoted labors of Christian women , and to withhold official recognition from them . I do not think it necessary , in order to be a deaconess , that a woman should come out and be separate from her home and kindred , any more than that a man should do so in order to be eligible to the priesthood or the episcopate . If a married woman wishes to be a deaconess , and is of suitable age and qualifications , she ought to be ordained as one by the bishop , that she may be a recognized assistant of her pastor wherever she goes . Only , in order to be sure that none but women of the right tact and temper were consecrated , I would have her credentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as my experience , that , though I have been more or less engaged in church work all my life long , it has been always at a conscious disadvantage . Nothing gives any one any ri*kf to interest one 's self in this , that , or the other , and if one chooses to do so , it is at the cost of being thought officious , forward , or overbearing , or of being obliged to play the complacent , see things go all wrong , yet still say nothing . What is true of the Episcopal Church I suppose to be true of all Protestant churches . The priests of them all more or less , in true masculine fashion , ignore half the human race , while the conventual system of the Romish Church is worse still ; - though the Roman Sisters of Charity , were it not for their enforced celibacy and general wai*it of breadth and culture , not to say ignorance , would perfectly represent one of the noblest types of deaconess . But whether men ever give the few among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to remember is this : that , in whichever of the countless chapels of the universal cathedral we worship , the majority of us are knit and covenanted together in the fellowship of the body and blood of Christ . // Most women are " members " of some church . Publicly , therefore , we have taken Jesus for our Head . Call him GOD or man , still we are ranged under his leadership , and if we strive to be faithful followers , or , deeper still , true members of his mystical body , our work must grow up with his inspiration . Not one corner of our civilization , then , simply should be set aside for a sanctuary , but the whole of it should be the yearning irrepressible , the upgrowth and outgrowth of our devotion to his Glad-Tidings preached for the renewing of this blind and diseased and suffering human congregation , into an image of the glorious hierarchies of Heaven . " Thy kingdom come , thy will be done . " Millions of Christian women make this petition every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy to bring it about ? Who of us understands " give us this day our daily bread " to mean " give it to us whether we strive for it or not " ? Not one : and so , perhaps , we may pray unnumbered ages in this stupid and sluggish spirit for Christ 's kingdom to come ; but it never will come until , with all our feminine powers and all our mighty love , we do our share toward hastening it . " Except the Lord build the house , their labor is but lost that build it . " The *vretched history of so many masculine nationalities that go stubbornly along in their own way shows but too well how lost ! Yet , even granting that strong men could do without the Gospel , weak women can not . Jesus was our Iirst , as he is still our best and truest , Friend . In the depths of the unutterable degradation to which paganism had reduced the sex , he alone saw what was in us , and raised us up . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women of heathen nations , we owe it all to him ; and whatever remains to be accomplished of our elevation must come through devotion to his teaching . I believe that , except as ( liristians , " bearing all things " with each other , " believino all things " possible to each other , " hoping *ll things " for each other , " enduring all things " from each other , - and all for our Master 's glory , - women can do nothing . F or we care very little for ourselves or for each other ; nearly all we attempt is for some outside object , - for some child , or some man , or some God . Were men , for instance , to tell us to undertake this reform , we should accomplish it quickly and gladly enough . I think they will tell us no such thing ; but , in view of all the interests that depend on it , can we not believe that HE who loves us , and whom we love beyond men , asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake ? It may not be an easy task , and to succeed in it we shall need our intensest energy , and more than all our present self-command . But what we lack ourselves I believe to exist in the Gospel in all its plenitude . By beginning and continuing perfectly in the spirit of Christ , the Heavenly Powers themselves must be our builders . We need only strive to be living stones in the hand of the Divine Architect . Then all " our walls will be salvation , and all our gates praise , and we shall need " no temple therein , for the Lamb will be its temple . " MAN AND WOMAN FAcE TO FACE . There is a wonderful land called The Future , and somewhere in that land stands the structure of the feminine civilization , - its golden domes glittering in the sunshine , - its airy pinnacles springing into the ether , - bright contrast to the vast , time-worn towers and sombre splendors of its frowning brother . Silently and swiftly it rose , in fewer years than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results that men by little and little so painfully *vrought out for themselves were ready to our requirement ; and noav the perfume of its gardens streams over the sea , its music vibrates round the land , troops of lovely children play over its grassy lawns , and an exquisite birlhood clusters within its deep , sculptured porches . Is it an opposing citadel , or a true home , created by love , whither every man may come to find refreshing , peace , and joy ? Beautiful // it stands , but , against the crowded cannon of the grim masculine battlements , as defenceless as the child 's bubble that an instant rests upon the sward . Will they ever open upon its crystal walls ? nay , xviii they even dare to thunder against each other as they have done through so many bloody generations ? The roar alone would shatter its delicate pillars and fairy arches , and bury their builders in the fall . - The builders ? yes , the women builders , the beloved , the wives and mothers of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more " terrible " in their suppliance than " an army with banners , " and bearing a petition to the nations as they are about to rush forth to their xvild work of war and wasting . What says the petition ? Only this : WAR MURDERS YOU , AND RUINS US . The solemn sentence speaks too much for them not to deliberate over it , and at last they recognize that , be what loss or gain it may to men , to women war never is nor can be anything but incalculable ill . I tell the women of this generation that they may take sides , as pleases the passion of their unthinking sympathy , with this or that masculine war , but there is no war , especially no great or long - continued or expensive war , that does not grind a stratum of the feminine community to powder , and , by just so much , lower all the rest ; and that not alone the women of the country which happens to be the scene of the contest , - their miseries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women of the unscathed , of the winfling side . Ruskin spoke even deeper than he meant , when he said that on the breaking out of a war all the women should go into black . They should go in to mourning , yea , into sackcloth and ashes , for into worse than this must the war , before it ends , bring many a now inn ? wife and maiden . The separating of the hitherto jumbled interests and responsibilities of the two sexes would make these truths so apparent , that one , great result of feminine co-operation and consultation would he the abandoning the national system of warfare , which is as senseless , as wasteful , and more wicked than the private wars of the old feudal barons which kept the world back for six hundred years . For they were ignorant , but we say " we see , " therefore we " have no cloak for our sin . " An international court where the disputes of nations could be adjusted , and an international police of married soldiers to enforce its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demoralization of war can be prevented , and the problem of the application of brute force in government solved for the world at large , as law and courts of justice and constables have solved it for the world 's separate communities . Two FINAL CONSIDERATIONS . At the close of these papers I would say to the women who may have been so kind as to read them , that I place little stress on the particular plan they propose . Co-operative Housekeeping may be wholly practicable or wholly visionary . But two things women must do somehow , as the conditions not only of the future happiness , progress , and elevation of their sex , but of its bare respectability and morality . 1st . They must earn their own livino 2d . They must be organized among themselves . To accomplish these imperative results in the quickest and easiest way has alone been my object in trying to stimulate them to throw themselves , as it were , upon their own resources ; that is , combine together on the capital furnished them by men for their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part , at least , of the retail trade into their hands , and so gain the independent and responsible handling of money , with all its incalculable stimulus to invention , enterprise , and independence of thought . One question is , Is such a feminine development possible ? for to many the dream will seem as extravagant as an opium vision . I answer , to those who know that to the faint beginnings of // trade among the squalid serfs of the Dark Ages Europe owes her powerful middle class , her commerce , her manufactures , her constitutional liberties , her greatest geniuses , - ourselves , her mighty offspring , - my im.a*inings concerning the future unfolding of womanhood will , seem reasonable enough . Close-shut bud that it has remained amid the national storms of a*es , who can tell , indeed , what forms and colors it will assume when at length the Sun of Righteousness pours down upon it unintercepted his *racious beams ! The other question is , Whether , in case such a feminine development be possible , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . It depend0 upon a single consideration . If manhood is commensurate with humanity , and womanhood is only an accident , a temporary provision of physical natum for the perpetuation of the race , then it is probable that nothing worth while wozdd follow from organizing the world of women . This of course is , and always has been , the prevailing sentiment , . otherwise there is no adequate explanation of the contempt men always express for possible feminine achievement and the distrust that , in consequence , women themselves have hitherto felt of it . " They hunt old trails , ' said Cyril , very *eiI ; But when did women ever yet invent ? " ' This is the whole thing in a sentence . Because women do not oribi ' - nate , their practical and mental power is esteemed worthless . And yet the great mystery of Nature might teach us a very different lesson . Granted that all the vitalizing mental power of the race resides with men : the analogy from the physical world seems to show that the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they can only begin . Therefore I , for one ; cheerfully surrencler to them the point of originality ; I may know nothing in the whole realm of thought or invention that they have not started . But I also know nothing that they have perfected . Their learnMarch , . ing , arts , and sciences are all one-sided * their churches inadequate ; their governments and societies at once incoinplete and rotting into dilapidation and : decay . One after another their melancholy civilizations rise , return upon themselves , and are not . To judge what men alone can avail for humanity , it is quite enough to read an article in a recent number of the North British Revie called " The Social Sores of Britain . " With all their genius and all their energy , /k&amp; festering community is the best that the greatest masculine race the world ever saw can show , after trying a thousand years ! while the rapid downward rush of American politics and morals is filling every thoughtful mind with terror . Observh*g all these disorders and ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible to avoid the conclusion that there is a missing element somewhere ; and as . there is no element in humanity beside the two , that it must be the feminine element . I think , then , that women may very gently say to their brethren , with-. out the least disrespect or self-conceit : " Ye L ke too much upon you , ye sons of Adam . We will not meddle with your concerns , but , if you please , . we will just help you by attending to our own , which you have , indeed , most kindly tried to manage for us , but have simply got into the worst confusion . We deny , altogether , being the lesser man , and are tired of the r$Zc of little brother . XVe are not an accident of nature , we are a necessity of Eternity . Our souls stamp the sex upon our bodies , , not our bodies upon our souls . Feminine these are , and feminine they will remain forever . Why , then , are we to wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think that givin a young girl , for a time , the diet and exercise of a prize-fighter would turn her into a man ? It would only help to make her a physically ' strong and perfe6t woman . So , too , the feminine mind and heart can not be made masculine by any abundance of ' education , freedom , and responsibility , , Co-opcraz'ivc Housekcepi ; zg-. // but xviii round , through their means , into curves of beauty and harmony , expressive of force and health indeed , but from these very qualities only the more enchanting . It is not womanhood you get , 0 men , by the conventional repressing process , but childhood ; and thus it is that to this day there is no true marriage of the sexes on the earth , hut a lonely and cruel lord stalks through the neglected and unfinished apartments of his ever-widening palace , while she who should be his friend , his love , his wife , drudges with his menials in the basement , or feebly amuses him in the drawing-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too often a sycophant and a slave . " What is the matter with men , that they do not wish us to be noble , that they are not noble toward us ? It is that they have no faith in the absoluteness of our sex . The " feminine , " the " beautiful " in us constitutes our highest value to them . And seeing our modes of life so different from their own , they imagine that the secret of the charm is in this , and they can not bear any suggestion of chan be . Then we ourselves must be softly brave against their prejudices and distrust ; must insist that women can very easily combine the beautiful and the useful , the real and the ideal ; must show them that , not so much the pursuit itself , but the manner of it , is feminine or unfeminine ; must take care , above all , while we try to advance , that we do not throw aside , as some in the van too rashly have , the graces , the harmonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ womanhood . CONCLUSION . " Old things are passed away . Behold , all things have become new ! " How profound are the words , and how women hate them ! The feminine sphere that for ages stood so immovable beneath our feet , the mighty mechanical powers are rollins , rolling away from under us . In great part it is already gone , and sewing-machines , washing-machines , machines for every smallest office , are taking from us the little that is left of the old manual labor by which we once fed and clothed the world , and whose shadow we yet cling to so desperately . Crowding us together on the fast-lessening area , it would seem as though men were determined that women should have no longer a serious interest or an earnest occupation in the universe . But , in truth , a wider , freer , sunnier orb , that they themselves have created for us , is moving beside us , though all unseen by our timid and reluctant eyes . Their mills and factories by thousands heap up food and clothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is useless . At a ruinous expense both to them and to us they accomplish it ; but by planning our lives as I have indicated , we can assume this useful and profitable office , and thus become again what in the be0inning xvc were created , helps , * for men in their new circumstances , and be in reality , what now we are only in name , " Ladies , " - that is " Loafgivers , " almoners of their bounty , not only to our own families , but to all the needy , the destitute , the wretched of the whole race . The leap is wide , and it must be taken together , but it is our best chance of uniting the grand and true old feminine functions of house-ordering , of food-preparing , and of clothes-providing , with the noble modern elements of taste and culture and freedom . " Give her of the fruit of her hands , and let HER OWN WORKS praise her in the gates . " 0 , when upon the immortal warp , stamped with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall we moderns weave in with glowing thread the still more resplendent feminine ideal , that all the knowledge and advantages of this happier age should teach us ? When indeed ? " Lord , lift Thou up the light of Thy countenance upon us. "
