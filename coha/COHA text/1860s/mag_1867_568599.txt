ARTICLE VJ. - JUDGE FARRAR ON THE CONSTITUTION . ilfanual of the Constitution of the United States of America . By TIMOTHY FARRAR . Boston : Little , Brown &amp; Co. 1867 . THOSE of our readers who remember the Articles from Judge Farrar 's pen , which appeared in this IReview during the war , in which he discussed the powers of the General Government and of the States under the Constitution , will welcome the announcement of this work . Nor will their expectations be disappointed upon a closer acquaintance . An elegant volume , as a mere spe*irnen of book making , its beautiful typography and paper afford to the reader 's eye the same pleasure in its perusal which the clear , strong thought , the logical argument , and the vigorous style of the author , will furnish to his intellectual powers and literary taste . It is interesting in this year 1867 to turn back to the first of Judge Farrar 's Articles above referred to , on " The Adequacy of the Constitution , " written , as it was , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government to survive a civil war , or even to take suitable measures for its own defense , was a question of anxious uncertainty ; and to read again the language of unfaltering courage and implicit faith with which " the plenary adequacy of the Constitution to all the purposes of its creation** is there asserted and maintained . The doctrines there set forth have since been fully sanctioned , and practically vindicated ; so fully , that it may be doubted to-day , whether they will ever again be questioned even as abstract matters of law . That dread ordeal of secession , at whose very approach it was thought the Government and the Constitution must be rolled up as a scroll and pass away with a great noise , has been triumphantly passed through ; and if there is a truth concerning our republic of which the world is still in doubt , it is not that of its ability under the Constitution to meet and // conquer internal convulsions which no other government could survive . Not less instructive is it at the present time to recur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in October , 1862  --  the darkest and most doubtful period of our great struggle for existence . With the same perfect confidence in the strength of the Constitution to sustain successfully the strain upon its endurance , he discusses the status of the rebel states , which had placed themselves outside of its pale , and , as if they were already subdued , the forfeitures and disabilities to which they had subjected themselves by their misuser or nonuser of their rights , duties , and franchises . The question which most men scarcely wearied their anxious minds with then , but which , when the conflict was brought to a successful issue , became , and still continues , a Serbonian bog of inextricable muddle , " Are the rebel states in the Union or out of it ? " Judge Parrar , with foresight of its future importance , treats with sound practical sense and lucid reasoning . In the volume befcre us , in considering " the means by which states may get out of the Union " - pp. 374-381  --  the same ideas are more fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quote the language of the Article . These states , he says , as states , have neglected and disobeyed positive duties imposed upon them in their corporate capacity by the Constitution as states they have abjured their allegiance , declared independence , and made organized war on the General Government . No misuser or nonuser of privileges , to be compared with this , was ever alleged against the city of London , or the Colonies of Massachusetts or Connec. ticut , or any other political community , whose franchises were claimed as forfeited to the Government for that cause . The proceedings in those cases were never complained of , on the ground that they were illegal in form , or that those communities , as well as all others , were not liable to have their rights , privileges , and franchises , declared forfeited and canceled , for good cause , on information quo warranto ; but solely on the ground of an unjust and oppressive use of judicial process , through the servility of corrupt judges . If for these causes , the States that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there must be some reason for the distinction that is not readily perceptible . It is certain that if such violations of duty are not sufficient causes of forfeiture , and the forfeiture may not be exacted , that the States can not be governed . VoL xxi. , p. 704. // And he adds , It is to be hoped the nation will stand till Congress shall wake to the necessity of adopting some law by which the rejected privileges and franchises of rebel states may be legally declared forfeited and canceled ; and so the way be opened for such new divisions , combinations , and organizations , as will guarantee the safety of the nation by securing the loyalty of the people . p. 706 . Five years have passed since these words were written ; more than two since they became of practical importance in their bearing upon Reconstruction . The puzzle of casuistry , which Judge Farrar here and in his Manual disposes of in three pages of unanswerable argument , has meantime distracted the nation almost as dangerously as the war itself . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union " - " The States are out of the Union , " has been and still is kept up , with as little prospect of final agreement as attends the insect discussion , but with far more serious consequences and possibilities . By the divisions it has caused it has given ne*w strength to the pro-rebel party north and south ; it has blocked the wheels of reconstruction in Congress , and caused that body , when every hour was of importance , and systematic action was of vital necessity , to flounder hopelessly for months and years through interminable discussions without a policy ; and ( worst and most afflictive dispensation of all ! ) it has enabled the crazy occupant of the White House , in the midst of the confusion , to escape from control , and to disgust the nation and threaten its safety by his antics . At last , driven by irresistible pressure to some immediate action , whether logical or not , the practical sense of Congress and the people has adopted ( in spite of all their doubts as to its constitutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has here marked out as the legitimate course . At this day , by law of Congress , the abjured franchises of the rebel states are practically declared forfeited and annulled , until , upon promise and guarantees of fnture good behavior , they shall be restored by legislative enactment . What these guarantees should be is expressed by Judge Farrar in the volume before us-p. 377 . The first requisite to any reconstruction , as it should be to any original con. struction , is a loyal population of sufficient physical , moral , and intellectual // power to be adequate to the support and maintenance of the government of a State in the Union , according to the principles of the Constitution . Without this no new State ever ought to have been admitted , and no old State ought , in any form , to be resuscitated . We have referred thus fully to Judge Farrar 's Articles in this review because there is so much identity of thought , language , and topics , between them and his book , that a criticism of the one applies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is more comprehensive in its plan and analysis . It treats of the Constitution in all its parts and provisions , while the Articles referred to discuss it only in its relation to certain controverted subjects . But in the discussion of these subjects it became necessary to recur to the great underlying ideas and principles of the Constitution , by which alone it can be properly understood and interpreted in all its parts , and these ideas and principles themselves , not being universally understood or accepted , required to be more fully developed and established , in order to properly exhibit both their truth and their importance . Accordingly , Judge Farrar , during the war , as he states in his preface , " with a particular view to the practical operation of our Government under all the varieties of its circumstances , and to the principles on which the questions evolved by them have been , or should be , decided , " compiled this treatise . Looking back over the history of our nation , its changing conditions , circumstances , and necessities , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so suggestive of future possibilities , it was natural that he should feel deeply impressed with the importance of applying such principles of construction to the Constitution of our government as should enable it to adapt itself to every possible change of circumstance , and thus prove adequate to every emergency . It was made not for a day but for all time , and it must contain within itself the anticipations of all possible futures . By this adaptability has the Briti3h Constitution maintained itself unshaken and ever-strengthening through six centuries , and without it there is no reason to believe that our own will escape destruction . The Constitution must expand with the country . If it is a bed of Procrustes , to which but one form , size , and shape of people and circumstance is // suited , and to the rigid narrowness of whose original , literal construction the nation must , in every age and condition , be made forcibly to conform , it must inevitably perish . But if it proves in its practical use to be an ample cloak , capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , and adjusting itself to all the varying requirements and exigencies to which nations in the long course of ages are liable , then we may well trust that the author of this volume breathes no vain hope in his reverent prayer , " Edo perpetual " The necessity for this adaptability is thus suggested by Judge Farrar in his preface , p. viii . The difference between a community of three millions of people , scattered along a narrow belt of sea-coast , inclosed by impenetrable forests , and thirty or forty millions , occupying half a continent , and pursuing all the objects , and by all the arts and means , which the reason or passions , the interest or ambition , the virtues or vices , of men could invent ,  --  must soon make itself apparent in the inevitable development of those powers of regulation which were expressly designed and intendbd to provide for just such increasing claims for their exercise . And he adds , p. ix. , The results of our marked experience should be noted and studied , as well to enable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development of the destinies of a great people , as for the permanent use of those who may enjoy the future blessings of our institutions . In these suggestions that our views of the Constitution must enlarge with the growth of the nation and its altering circumstances , Judge Farrar expresses what has long been felt by reflecting minds , and what the events of the past five years have deeply impressed upon the people at large . Indeed , scarcely had it gone into operation before the necessity of adapting it to unforeseen emergencies became apparent , and new views of its scope and purpose began to be taken . That literal construction at first insisted on , which allowed nothing to the General Government for which no clear language of grant could be shown , was speedily found to be totally impracticable . The purchase of Louisiana was almost universally agreed at the time to be an unconstitutional usurpation of power . Mr. Jefferson said that he found no difference of opinion on that subject . Yet so manifestly necessary and // proper was it for the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national government that it was universally approved , and afterwards imitated in similar acquisitions . Warrant was then found for such acts in the idea that they were extra-constitutional  --  the exercise of powers which , though not expressly or impliedly vested in the General Government by the Constitution , were not prohibited by it , and so , not being reserved to the states respectively or to the people , might suitably be adopted by the General Government for want of a better owner . But under the broader views of the Constitution which now begin to prevail , and of which Judge Farrar is the most advanced exponent , it is seen that all these acts are clearly within the constitutional power of the General Government as necessarily incident to its character . The same or similar changes of view have taken place with regard to other controverted acts by different departments of the Government . Judge Story enumerates several in his Coinmentaries , ancbmany more have occurred since that work was written , especially in the course of our civil war . Everybody now sees and admits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usurpations , that they are so necessary and inevitable that if the Constitution confers no other authority for them , such authority legally and logically results from its governmental character . That without which the Government could not exist-could not exercise its functions-needs not be expressly conferred ; it belongs to the Government as a matter of course , otherwise the Constitution perpetrates the absurdity of creating a government and then striking it with paralysis . The fact , if it be a fact , that the founders of the Constitution themselves did not contemplate any such expansion of powers by the General Government as is now accorded it , and that they provided a mode of effecting any necessary changes in its form or authority by amendment , is no argument against the correctness of this view . For the doctrine is that , without amendment , the Government already rightfully possesses all requisite powers . And as to the expectations of its framers , the question is not what expectations they entertained , but what they designed to create . With ideas and experience limited by the then moderate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some vague anticipations indeed of its possible future greatness , but no conception of those immense alterations in its material affairs and social composition , which may be said to have scarcely commenced till fifty years afterward , they yet designed to form an enduring government , one which through all mutations should , for ages to come , be adequate to all the ends and purposes of a national government , and preserve the blessings of liberty to themselves and their posterity . Little did they realize how magnificently their work would transcend their expectations ! by what delicate and desperate tests its powers would be developed ! They builded better than they knew ! Had they threseen the half of what has since transpired , they might well have despaired of devising any form of government that could endure . That their structure still survives , vaster , stronger , and more symnmetrical than it stood in their own conceptions , is no disparagement of their foresight , but evinces that they were guided by a'wisdom higher than their own . What then is the great foundation principle which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and determining its adaptability to every phase and every emergency ? It is nothing newly discovered . It is as old as the Constitution itself . It was present , consciously present in the minds and counsels of its framers , and was by them conspicuously inscribed upon the very portal of their edifice , the record of its great idea and purpose  --  the rule by which it was intended to be judged and used in all its parts and applications . Yet , strangely enough nothing about the Constitution has been so much disputed as this very principle . Its truth has been denied and maintained in every form of writing and con troversy , until finally bloody war , the last argument of all controversialists , has established it , it is to be hoped forever . Judge Farrar lays it down in the very first paragraph of his book as a postulate no longer requiring discussion , that " the Constitution as the supreme law of the land constitutes a GOVERNMENT , , for the purpose , and of course with the power and duty of executing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the introductory clause of the Constitution , he treats as no formal , prelirninary verbiage , but as containing , and designed to convey , the essen // Judge Farrctr on the Cbn8titution . Oct. , tial fundamental idea of the entire instrument . The clause itself he declares is " the essence and epitome " of the whole . It is itself the Constitution , the supreme law of the land , ordained and established by " us , the people , " the original source of all political power , and it proprio vigore creates a government , with all the powers necessarily and properly involved in that term , which are requisite to accomplish the purposes for which it was created . And , farther to avoid all doubt upon this point , these purposes are distinctly specified . They are , " to form a more perfect union , establish justice , ensure domestic tranquillity , provide for the common defense , promote the general welfare , and secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity . " These are the express purposes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ordinance of the American people is the law , the paramount law . The law imposes the duty , and the duty carries with it the power . Here , in this enacting clause , is the epitome and essence of the whole Constitution . Had it ended here , nothing would have been wanting but the details , specifications , limitations , and qualifications which the government itself could have supplied , if the people had seen fit to omit doing it for them . " There can be no doubt , " says Mr. Madison , " that all the particular powers , requisite as means of executing the general powers , would have resulted to the government , by unavoidable implication . No axiom is more clearly established in law or in reason , than that , whenever the end is required , the means are authorized ; wherever a general power to do a thing is given , every particular power necessary for doing it is included . " p. *8 . In the proposition that the whole Constitution is embodied in this enactment of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far in advance of other commentators and of the general view . It constitutes , never theless , the leading idea of his book , and is reiterated and enforced with an emphasis , learning and argument that fully command our attention and respect . Judge Story , in his chapter on " The Preamble , " regards it as matter of inducement onlyexplanatory of what follows . " It can not confer , " he says , " any power per se , ' it can never amount by implication to an enlargement of any power expressly given . * * Its true office is to expound the nature and extent and application of the powers actually conferred by the Constitution , and not substantially to create them . " But Judge Farrar , writing thirty-three years later , and in view of experiences undreamed // of by his predecessor , takes a broader view of this clause and its office . He denies that it is a preamble either in form or object . He claims that it was not so regarded or designated by the framers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with much particularity and research into the history of the clause in the Convention . He insists that it was deliberately adopted after much discussion , and various changes , as expressing authoritatively the purpose and nature of the work- " the first , most authoritative , and commanding portion of the instrument . " As it is a universal rule of construction that the intent is to govern ,  --  this expression of the intent and purpose of the Constituion is the embodiment of it  --  the rest is matter of detail , subordinate and explanatory . Hence , rejecting the designation of " Preamble " he styles it " the enacting clause "  --  the ordaining and establishing Precept . To put all this out of the Constitution , by construction , is to decapitate it entirely . It would leave it only the fragment of a law ; without a lawgiver , without an enactment , without a subject and without an object . On the contrary , this first sentence is the principle and governing clause of the whole instrument . p. 8 ' 7 . Having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farrar adopts , with logical consistency , all the corollaries which result from it , and advances views which thirty , or even ten , years ago would have been denounced as the most extreme and dangerous of political heresies . On any just principles of reasoning , it is impossible to consider the general government unauthorized to do aiiything that the people assert they made it on purpose to do . " In order " to accomplish certain specified objects , those objects are ipso facto submitted to its jurisdiction , and may be accomplished by any means under its control ; and not only all specified powers , but all other necessary means , are expressly placed at its control , for the very purpose of executing the jurisdiction so vested in it . When the Constitution requires an end , it authorizes all the means of the government to be applied to it ; and , when it directs means , ft authorizes their application to any constitutional end . And not only may and must the General Government take all necessary measures to accomplish these general objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even though apparently within the scope of its enumerated powers , are unconstitutional in character . Thus any recognition or toleration of slavery by statute , even as a state institution , // *Jud*ie 7arrar on the Constitution . Oct. , must be unconstitutional upon the general ground that it violates the purpose and duty of the Government " to establish justice and secure the blessings of liberty " to the people . And this being the design and character of the Government , immediately upon its establishment , ipso facto , all laws , customs , or institutions inconsistent with this supreme law became abrogated and void . There is yet another reason why slaves can not be intended by either classification ; which is , because there are none , and can be none , under the jurisdiction of our government . The Constitution was made " to secure the blessings of liberty . " It perpetuates the right to liberty by perpetuating the common-law right to the " writ of habeas corpus , " which restores liberty whenever it is infringed . And it declared that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - - - without due process of law . " So there can be no slaves in the land . There never was , and never can be , a person legally held in slavery under our Constitution . p. 164 . And , accordingly , he considers the 13th amendment , whereby slavery was abolished , entirely superfluous . We have'heretofore seen that the Constitution , as it originally stood , never authorized slavery or property in man , in any form or under any name ; and that the personal rights of the citizen* , whether natural-born or naturalized , recognized and covered by it , are altogether incompatible with the existence of any such relation among the people . So that the only legal operation of this amendment was to reassure the original Constitution in this respect , and to negative and countermand , in express terms , the system of violence and injustice that had been illegally and studiously fostered and extended , under a false construction and maladministration of an instrument adapted and intended to effect its decline and extinction . The 2d section of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by authorizing Congress " to enforce " this particular provision , when they had abundant authority for executing the whole Constitution without it . p. 400 . It will hardly be denied , we think , by Judge Farrar , that these views of Constitutional interpretation are in the extreme van of consolidationalism , and it seems to us that they tend to the ultimate extinction of all state rights and governments . We have serious doubts from our recollections of history , whether the framers of our Constitution really designed to vest such unlimited authority in the central government , as best calculated to secure the establishment of justice or the security of liberty ; and we are quite convinced that if they did , experience has not confirmed their view . The great satety of our country is not in our central system , nor in our federal system , but in both combined-balancing and controlling each // other ; and it would , in our opinion , be as dangerous to reduce the latter to weakness or insignificance as the former . hence we are not yet fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal constructions and judicial decisions of nearly three generations , whereby the limited power of the General Government has been established , and the rule settled , that neither a corporation nor a government , " ordained and established " for designated purposes , can claim an " enacting clause " to be the " essence and epitome " of its charter , and under it exercise " not only its specified powers , but all other neceseary means , as expressly placed at its control for the purpose of executing the jurisdiction so vested . " Yet these views , apart from the rare vigor and ability with which they are enforced , are interesting as a development of doctrines which are constantly growing in influence . The vast growth of the General Government in power and importance since its formation is well understood , and the tendency is still in the same direction . It is , indeed , the only expansible portion of our system . The states must remain stationary both in their territorial and political rights  --  but the grandeur and scope of the General Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The party of strict , literal construction has passed away-that of liberal construction , as heretofore understood , begins to adopt a wider latitude of view  --  and a new school of broad constructionists is appearing who make little of the letter , and much of the spirit  --  and who find in general clauses the best possible warrant for the exercise of every doubtful power . The growth of our country in all the elements of Empire , and in the extent and complication of its interests , will stimulate this school of interpretation to large development . It must inevitably be so . The genius and the destiny of the Republic are to grow , and in another generation , Young America , following this class of commentators in their march over all barriers , and over all rules of construction , will practically adopt as " the essence and epitome " of its national charter , that original constitution first given to man : - " Increase and multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it ; and have dominion over the beasts of the field // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living thing that inoveth upon the earth . " Our space will not permit ns to notice at length the views of Judge Parrar upon other constitutional questions-such as those relating to habeas corpus , treason , and attainder , and the relations of the states to the Federal Government . They are such , however , as to command the general approval and concurrence , and have been already fully presented by him in this Review . Upon the respective powers and duties of the President and Congress in reconstructing the conquered states , he is clear and emphatic . He justly insists that the President has no power whatever to declare or to terminate war . That his sole province is to execute the laws of war towards enemies hostile or subdued until the legislature shall determine the fact and the terms of peace . If he goes beyond this and sets himself up as a legislative department with " a policy " of his own ,  - -  If he undertakes to proclaim peace , abandons his military supervision , and remits them to the independent election and administration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have formerly practised , or may thereafter adopt , he not only violates his trust , and abandons his official duty , but he usurps the sovereignty and authority of the nation which in no sense belong to him , and which only are adequate to confer peace and political rights on such a people . But , even if they could have peace , having no lawful civil government within the Union , and no right to create one , they would be exclusively under the Constitution and laws of the United States . These , as the executive and the only civil magistrate , he would be bound to execute and administer , as they stood , in the most effectual manner he could under the circumstances , till the law-making power should furnish the needful additions . He could make no new laws , nor authorize others to make them , or administer them if they were made , any more than he could do the same things for the rest of the national domain . pp. 442 , 443 . On the other hand , the authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is supreme . They had the same right to organize republican governments for them , and permit them , so far as they deemed it safe , to govern themselves theieby , and to readmit them to all the rights and privileges of " states in the Union , " which they had cast off and rejected , as they had to perform a similar operation in the Territories . It was the failure of Congress in these respects that gave the President the right , and imposed on him the duty , of continuing to govern them by martial law ; and enabled him , by the neglect of that right and the violation of that duty , not to govern them at all , but to leave them. , in destitution ofany suitable exter // nal control , to do what mischief they pleased to each other , and to the rest of the good people of the United States . pp. 444 , 445 . These are , unquestionably , as it seems to us , the only principles by which a republican government can be maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives of the people . The President has simply the subordinate office of executing the laws which the people by their representatives for that purpose duly elected may make . To assume himself to be an equal power in the government , to enter into a factious controversy with the legislature respecting the proper laws to be passed , or to interfere with their independent action by corrupting or intimidating influences , are flagrant violations of his duties and of their privilege . The President of this republic is a chief magistrate simply , and not a despot . There are few greater or more prevalent mistakes than the idea that presidential candidates should be selected from our most brilliant men . If the incumbent of that office will c&amp;nflne himself to his legitimate sphere , great talents are no more necessary to him than to a sovereign of the British Empire . Indeed , an honest man of sound sense , and firm resolution to do his simple duty plainly and well , makes a far safer chief magistrate than a talented , ambitious party chief , who will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , his party , or even of the presidential office . A most interesting and instructive chapter might be written illustrative of this truth drawn from the history of executive usurpations in the progress of our Government . A bold , strong , self-willed man in the presidential chair , may be guilty of the most frequent and dangerous encroachments upon the liberties of the people , and yet by the very heroism of his crimes command their admiration and support . Happily there is some reason , also , to believe that a weak , low minded braggart , in similar attempts , will excite only ridicule and disgust . The crow could not carry off the sheep in imitation of the eagle , and the frog , which assumed to be an ox , only burst himself in the effort . The subject of impeachment we should have been pleased to see more fully treated by Judge Farrar . Though he has given it considerable space , yet , as it may become a subject of much // importance , all the light that can be obtained regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely that in the earlier periods of our Government , impeachment was looked upon as a more simple and easily applied remedy for maladministration than we now regard it . Mr. Madison , in the first Congress , declared , that " for the wanton removal of meritorious officers , the President would be impeached and removed from his high trust . " Yet the proceeding has been sparingly resorted to in the history of the Government , and at the present day it must be viewed , at least in its application to the presidential office , as a proceeding almost revolutionary in its character , dangerous as a precedent , and only to be employed in the very last emergency . Eighty years have passed since the Constitution was framed , and in that period wonderful changes , social , material and intellectual , have passed over our country . Greater changes still are impending . The nation is fast becoming consolidated into a powerful Empire . Are all these changes favorable to the permanence of our republican system ? and how shall the elements of danger which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and of its free institutions continue to work with its original smoothness and precision ; arid if not , what repairs are requisite to save it from ultimate ruin ? These are questions of the utmost interest and importance , and their solution , as it seems to us , must be sought fornotso much in broader constructions of constitutional powers in the government , as in the careful study and constant improvement of those popular institutions upon which the whole fabric of Government rests ; in promoting education and patriotism among the people-in devising and applying laws by which suffrage shall be made to rest upon intelligence , and the tenure of office upon qualification ; by which the rancor and strength of partics shall be subverted through securing the representation of minorities-preventing political proscription , and diminishing patronage ; by which elections shall be so regulated that frauds shall be imupossible , and violence and corruption prevemi ted . What political students most need to employ their attention , skill , and contrivance upon for the next generation , is the 8cience // of practical democracy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fully understood , and it is to be hoped , firmly and forever established . Let all the featnres of practical effort and legislation by which popular institutions can best be guarded from decay or contamination , be studied and tended with equal vigilance and care ; let our republican system be so developed and improved that it shall be complete and perfect in all its details as a system of true principles rightly applied , and the Constitution , the great national heart , nourished and preserved by the pure strong blood of a healthy , popular life , will readily adapt itself to all the varying phases of the national existence , and our liberties will be enduring .
