Longfellow , Samuel , 1819-1892 : PSALM OF LIFE . from A book of hymns ( 1866 ) 1 Tell me not , in mournful numbers , Life is but an empty dream ; For the soul is dead that slumbers , And things are not what they seem . 2 Life is real ! life is earnest ! And the grave is not its goal ; Dust thou art , to dust returnest , Was not spoken of the soul . 3 Not enjoyment , and not sorrow , Is our destined end and way ; But to act , that each to-morrow Find us further than to-day . 4 Lives of true men all remind us We can make our lives sublime , And , departing , leave behind us Footprints on the sands of time ; 5 Footprints which perhaps another , Sailing o'er life 's solemn main , A forlorn and shipwrecked brother , Seeing , shall take heart again . 6 Let us , then , be up and doing , With a heart for any fate ; Still achieving , still pursuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel , 1819-1892 : ORDINATION . from A book of hymns ( 1866 ) 1 Christ to the young man said : " Yet one thing more , If thou wouldst perfect be ; Sell all thou hast and give it to the poor , And come and follow me ! " 2 Within this temple , Christ again , unseen , Those sacred words has said ; And his invisible hands to-day have been Laid on a young man 's head . 3 And evermore beside him on his way , The unseen Christ shall move , That he may lean upon his arm and say , " Dost thou , dear Lord , approve ? " 4 Beside him at the marriage feast shall be , To make the scene more fair ; Beside him in the dark Gethsemane Of pain and midnight prayer . 5 O holy trust ! O endless sense of rest ! Like the beloved John , To lay his head upon the Saviour 's breast , And thus to journey on !             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
