AMERICAN FINANCES AND RESOURCES . LETTER NO. * I , FROM HON. ROBERT J. WALKER . LONDON , 10 Half Moon Street , Piccadilly , August 5 , 1863 . THE question has been often asked me , here and on the continent , Itow has your Secretary of the Treasury ( Yr. ( 1ha*se ) so marvellously sustained American credit during this rebellion , and when wilt your finances collapse ? This question I have frequently answered in conversations with European statesmen and bankers , and the discussion has closed generally in decided approval of Mr. Chase 's financial policy , and great confidence in the wonderful resources of the United States . Thus encouraged , I have concluded to discuss the question in a series of letters , explaining Mr. Chase 's system , and stating the reasons of its remarkable success . The interest in such a topic is not confined to the United States , nor to the present period , but extends to all times and nations . Indeed , finance , as a science , belongs to the world . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations , ' discussed , during the last century , with so much ability by Adam Smith . Although many great principles were then settled , yet political economy is emphatically progressive , especially the important branches of credit , currency , taxation , and revenue . Mr. Chase 's success has been complete under the most appalling difficulties . The preceding administration , by their treasonable course , and anti-coercion heresies , had almost paralyzed the Government . They had increased the rate of interest on Federal loans from six to nearly twelve pay cent . per annum . Their Vice-President ( Mr. Breckenridge ) , their Finance Minister ( Mr. Cobb ) , their Secretary of War ( Mr. Floyd ) , their Secfetary of the Interior ( Mr. Thompson ) , are now in the traitor army . Even the President ( Mr. Buchanan ) , with an evident purpose of aiding the South to dissolve the Union , had announced in his messages the absurd political paradox , that a State has no right to secede , but that the Government has no right to prevent its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head of which stood the President , secretly pledged , at Ostend and Cincinnati , to the South ( as the price of their support ) , to aid them to control or destroy the republic . Thus was it that , in time of profound peace , when our United States six per cents . commanded a few weeks before a large premium , and our debt was less than $65,000,000 , that Mr. Buchanan 's Secretary of the Treasury ( Mr. Cobb ) was borrowing money at an interest of nearly twelve per cent . per annum . Most fortunately that accursed administration was drawing to a close , or the temporary overthrow of the Government would have been effected . Never did any minister of finance undertake a task apparently so hopeless as that so fully accomplished by Mr. Chase in reviving the public credit . A single fact will illustrate the extraordinary result . At the close of the fiscal year ending 1st July , 1860 , our public debt was only $64,769,703 , and Secretary Cobb was borrowing money at twelve per cent . per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the midst of a stupendous rebellion , our debt was $1,097,274,000 , and Mr. Chase had reduced the average rate of interest to 3*89 per cent . per annum , whilst the highest rate was 730 for a comparatively small sum to be paid off next year . This is a financial achievement without a parallel in the history of the world . If I speak on this subject with some enthusiasm , it is in no egotistioal // spirit , for Mr. Chase 's system differs in many respects widely from tliat adopted by me as Minister of Finance during the Mexican war , and which raised United States five per cent8. to a premium . But my system was based on specie , or its real and convertible equivalent , and would not have answered the present emergency , which , by our enormous expenditure , necessarily forced a partial and temporary suspension of specie payments upon our banks and Government . Mr. Chase 's system is exclusively his own , and , in many of its aspects , is without a precedent in history . When first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was forced upon a reluctant Congress by the great emergency , presenting the alternative of its adoption or financial ruin . Indeed , upon a test vote in Congress in February last , it had failed , when the premium on gold rose immediately over twenty per cent . This caused a reconsideration , when the bills were passed and the premium on gold was immediately reduced more than the previous rise , exhibiting the extraordinary difference in a few days of twenty-three per cent. , in the absence of any intermediate Federal victories in the field . Such are the facts . Let me now proceed to detail the causes of these remarkable results . The first element in the success of any Minister of Finance is the just confidence of the country in his ability , integrity , candor , courage , and patriotism . He may find it necessary , in some great emergency , like our rebellion , to diverge somewhat from the via trita of the past , and enter upon paths not lighted by the lamp of experience . He must never , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws developed by the physical sciences . When Mr. Chase , in his first annual Treasury Report of the 9th of December , 1861 , recommended his system of United States banks , organized by Congress throughout the country , furnishing a circulation based upon private means and credit , but se cured also by an adequate amount of Federal stock , held by the Government as security for its redemption , it was very unpopular , and encountered most violent opposition . The State banks , and all the great interests connected with them , were arrayed against the proposed system . When we reflect that many of these banks ( especially in the great State of New York ) were based on State stocks , and in many States that the banks yielded large revenues to the local Government ; - when we see , by our Census Tables of 1860 ( p. 193 ) , that these banks numbered 1642 , with a capital paid up of $421,890 , 095 , loans $691,495,580 , and a circulation and deposits , including specie , of $544 ,  - -  409,134 ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Secretary . This opposition was so formidable , that neither in the public press nor in Congress did this recommendation of Mr. Chase receive any considerable support . Speaking of the currency issued by the State banks , and of the substitute proposed by Mr. Chase , he presented the following views in his first annual Report before referred to , of December , 1861 The whole of this circnlation constitutes a loan without interest from the people to the banks , costing them nothing except the expense of issue and redemption and the interest on the specie kept on hand for the latter purpose ; and it deserves consideration whether sound policy does not require that the advantages of this loan be transferred in part at least , from the banks , representing only the i*terests of the stockholders , to the Government , representing the aggregate interests of the whole people . It has been well questioned by the most eminent statesmen whether a currency of bank notes , issued by local institutions under State laws , is not , in fact , prohibited by the national Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not within the letter , of the constitutional prohibition of the emission of bills of credit by the States , and of the making by them of anything except gold and silver coin a legal tender in payment of debts . // to be reasonably disputed that Congress , uader its constitutional powers to lay taxes , to regulate commerce , and to regulate the value of coin , possesses ample authority to control the credit circulation which enters so largely into the transactions of commerce and affects in so many ways the value of coin . In the judgment of the Secretary the time has arrived when Congress should exercise this authority . The value of the existing bank note circulation depends on the laws of thirty-four States hud the character of some sixteen hundred private corporations . It is usually furnished in greatest proportions by institutions of least actual capital . Circulation , commonly , is in the inverse ratio of solvency . Well-founded institutions , of large and solid capital , have , in general , comparatively little circulation ; while weak corporations almost invariably seek to sustain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this form . Under such a system , or rather lack of system , great fluctuations , and heavy losses in discounts and exchanges , are inevitable ; and not unfrequently , through failures of the issuing institutions , considerable portions of the circulation become suddenly worthless in the hands of the people . The recent experience of several States in the valley of the Mississippi painfully illustrates the justice of these observations ; and enforces by the most cogent practical arguments the duty of protecting commerce and industry against the recurrence of such disorders . The Secretary thinks it possible to combine with this protection a provision for circiflation , safe to the community and convenient for the Government . Two plans for effecting this object are suggested . The first contemplates the gradual withdrawal from circulation of the notes of private corporations and for the issue , in their stead of United States notes , payable in coin on demand , in amounts sufficient for the useful ends of a representative currency . The second contemplates the preparation and delivery , to institutions and associations , of notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured as to prompt convertibility into coin by the pledge of United States bonds and other needful regulations . The first of these plans was partial-465 ly adopted at the last session of Congress in the provision authorizing the Secretary to issue United States notes , payable in coin , to an amount not exceeding fifty millions of dollars . That provision may be so extended as to reach the average circulation of the country , while a moderate tax , gradually augmented , on bank notes , will relieve the national from the competition of local circulation . It has been already suggested that the substitution of a national for a State currency , upon this plan , would be equivalent to a loan to the Government without interest , except on the fund to be kept in coin , and without expense , except the cost of preparation , issue , and redemption ; while the people would gain the additional advantage of a uniform currency , and relief from a considerable burden in the form of interest on debt . These advantages are , doubtless , considerable ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circulation will be certainly and strictly confined to the real needs of the people , and kept constantly equivalent to specie by prompt and certain redemption in coin , it will hardly fail of legislative sanction . The plan , however , is not without serious inconveniences and hazards . The temptation , especially great in times of pressure and danger , to issue notes without adequate provision for redemption ; the ever-present liability to be called on for redemption beyond means , however carefully provided and managed ; the hazards of panics , precipitating demands for coin , concentrated on a few points and a single fund ; the risk of a depreciated , depreciating , and finally worthless paper money ; the immeasurable evils of dishonored public faith and national bankruptcy ; all these are possible consequenccs of the adoption of a system of government circulation . It may be said , and perhaps truly , that they are less deplorable than those of an irredeemable bank circulation . Without entering into that comparison , the Secretary contents himself with observing that , in his judgment , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan that he feels himself constrained to forbear recommending its adoption . The second plan suggested remains for examination . Its principal features are , ( 1st ) a circulation of notes bearing a common impression and authenticated American . FZnance8 and Resour'w*. // by a common authority ; ( 2d ) the redemption of these notes by the associations and institutions to which they may be delivered for issue ; and ( 3d ) the security of that redemption* by the pledge of th@United States stocks , and an adequate provision of specie . In this plan the people , in their ordinary business , would fiuid the advantages of uniformity in currency ; of uniformity in security ; of effectual safeguard , if effectual safeguard is possible , against depreciation ; and of protection from losses in discount and exchanges ; while in the operations of the Government the people would find the further advantage of a large demand for Government securities , of increased facilities for obtaining the loans required by the war , and of some alleviation of the burdens on industry through a diminution in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of circulation , without risking the perils of a great money monopoly . A further and important advantage to the people may be reasonably expected in the increased security of the Union , springing from the common interest in its preservation , created by the distribution of its stocks to associations throughout the country , as the basis of their circulation . The Secretary entertains the opinion that if a credit circulation in any form bo desirable , it is most desirable in this . The notes thus issued and secured would , in his judgment , form the safest currency which this country has ever enjoyed ; while their receivability for all Government dues , except customs , would make them , wherever payable , of equal value , as a currency , in every part of the Union . The large amount of specie now in the United States , reaching a total of not less than two hundred and seventy-five millions of dollars , will easily support payments of duties in coin , while these payments and ordinary demands will aid in retaining this specie in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The whole circulation of the country , except a limited amount of foreign coin , would , after the lapse of two or three years , bear the impress of the nation whether in coin or notes ; while the amount of the latter , always easily ascertainable , and , of course , always generally known , would not be likely to be increased beyond the real wants of business . He expresses an opinion in favor of this plan with the greater confidence , because it has the advantage of recommendation from experience . It is not an untried theory . lathe State of New York , and in one or more of the other States , it has been subjected , in its most essential parts , to the test of experiment , and has been found practicable and useful . The probabilities of success will not he diminished but increased by its adoption under national sanction and for the whole country . It only remains to add that the plan is recommended by one other consideration , which , in the judgment of the Secretary , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not altogether , the evils of a great and sudden change in the currency by offering inducements to solvent existing institutions to . withdraw the circulation issued under State authority , and substitute that provided by the authority of the Union . Thus , through the voluntary action of the existing institutions , aided by wise legislation , the great transition from a currency heterogeneous , unequal , and unsafe , to one uniform , equal , and safe , may be speedily and almost imperceptibly accomplished . If the Secretary has omitted the discussion of the question of the constitutional power of Congress to put this plan into operation , it is because no argument is necessary to establish the proposition that the power to regulate commerce and the value of coin includes the power to regulate the currency of the country , or the collateral proposition that the power to effect the end includes the power to adopt the necessary and expedient mt*ans . The Secretary entertains the hope that the plan now submitted , if adopted with the limitations and safeguards which the experience and wisdom of senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such value and stability to Government securities that it will not be difficult to obtain the additional loans required for the service of the current and the succeeding year at fair and reasonable rates ; especially if the public credit be supported by sufficient and certain , provision for the payment of interest and ultimate redemption of the principal . ' Congress adjourned after a session of eight months , and failed to adopt Mr. 4 // Chase 's recommendation . Indeed , it had then but few advocates in Congress or the country . Events rolled on , and our debt , as anticipated by Mr. Chase , became of vast dimensions . In his Report of December , 1861 , the public debt on the 30th June , 1862 ( the close of the fiscal year ) , was estimated by the Secretary at $517,372,800 ; and it was $514,211,371 , or more than $3,000,000 less than the estimate . In his Report of December 4 , 1862 , our debt , on the 30th June , 1863 , was estimated by Mr. Chase at $1,122,297,403 , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average rate of interest on this debt was 389 , being $41,927,980 , of which $30,141,080 was payable in gold , and $11,786,900 payable in Federal currency . It will thus be seen that the whole truth , as to our heavy debt , was always distinctly stated in advance by Mr. Chase , and that the debt has not now quite reached his estimate . Long before the date of the second annual Report of the Secretary , the banks had suspended specie payinents , and the Secretary renewed his former recommendation on that subject in these words While the Secretary thus repeats the preference he has heretofore expressed for a United States note circulation , even when issucIi direct by the Government , and dependent on the action of the Government for regulation and final redemption , over the note circulation of the numerous and variously organized and variously responsible banks now existing in the country ; and while he now sets forth , more fully than heretofore , the grounds of that preference , he still adheres to the opinion expressed in his last Thport , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking associalions , organized under a general act of Congress , is to be preferred to either . Such a circulation , uniform in general characteristics , and amply secured as to prompt convertibility by national bonds deposited in the treasury , by the associations receiving it , would unite , in his judgment , more elements of soundness and utility than can be combined in any other . A circulation composed exclusively of notes issued directly by the Government , or of such notes and coin , is recommended mainly by two considerations :  --  the first derived from the facility with which it may be provided in emergencies , and the second , from its cheapness The principal objections to such a circulation as a permanent system are , 1st , the facility of excessive expansion when expenditures exceed revenue ; 2d , the danger of lavish and corrupt expenditure , stimulated by facility of expansion ; 3d , the danger of fraud in management and supervision ; 4th , the impossibility of providing it in sufficient amounts for the wants of the people whenever expenditures are reduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all serious . The last requires some elucidation . It will be easily understood , however , if it be considered that a government issuing a credit circulation can not supply , in any given period , an amount of currency greater than the excess of its disbursements over its receipts . To that amount , it may create a debt in small notes , and these notes may be used as currency . This is precisely the way in which the . existing currency of United States notes is supplied . That portion of the expenditure not met by revenue or loans has been met by the issue of these notes . Debt in this form has been substituted for various debts in other forms . Whenever , therefore , the country shall be restored to a healthy normal condition , and receipts exceed expenditures , the supply of United States notes will be arrested , and must progressively diminish . Whatever demand may be made for their redemption in coin must hasten this diminution ; and there can be no reissue ; for reissue , under the condilions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposition , supplies more tha*i is needed for that purpose . There is , then , no mode in which a currency in United States notes can be permanently maintained , except by loans of them , when not required for disbursement , on deposits of coin , or pledge of securities , or in some other way . This would convert the treasury into a government bank , with all its hazards and mischiefs . If these reasonings be sound , little room can remain for doubt that the // evils certain to arise from such a scheme of currency , if adopted as a permanent system , greatly overbalance the temporary though not inconsiderable advantages offered by it . It remains to be considered what results may be reasonably expected from an act authorizing the organization of banking associations , such as the Secretary proposed in his last Report . The central idea of the proposed measure is the establishment of one sound , uniform circulation , of equal value throughout the country , upon the foundation of national credit combined with private capital . Such a currency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized under national legislation . It is proposed that these associations be entirely voluntary . Any persons , desirous of employing real capital in sufficient amounts , can , if the plan he adopted , unite together under proper articles , and having contributed the requisite capital , can invest such part of it , not less than a fixed minimum , in United States bonds , and , having deposited these bonds with the proper officer of thk* United States , can receive United States notes in such denominations as may be desired , and employ them as money in discounts and exchanges . The stockholders of any existing banks can , in like manner , organize under the act , and transfer , by such degrees as may be found convenient , the capital of the old to the use of the new associations . The notes thus put into circulation will be payable , until resumption , in United States notes , and , after resumption , in specie , by the association which issues them , on demand ; and if not so paid will be redeemable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bonds pledged in security . In the practical working of the plan , if sanctioned by Congress , redemption at one or more of the great commercial centres , will probably be provided for by all the associations which circulate the notes , and , in case any association shall fail in such redemption , the treasurer of the United States will probably , under discretionary authority , pay the notes , and cancel the public debt held as security . It seems difficult to conceive of a note circulation which will combine higher local and general credit than this . After a few years no other circulation would be used , nor could the issues of the national circulation be easily increased beyond the legitimate demands of business . Every dollar of circulation would represent real capital , actually invested in national stocks , and the total amount issued could always be easily and quickly ascertained from the books of the treasury . These circumstances , if they might not wholly remove the temptation to excessive issues , would certainly reduce it to the lowest point , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the signatures of national officers , and the imprint of the national seal authenticating the declaration borne on each that it is secured by bonds which represent the faith and capital of the whole country , could not fail to make every note as good in any part of the world as the best known and best esteemed national securities . The Secretary has already mentioned the support to public credit which may be expected from the proposed associations . The importance of this point may excuse some additional observations . The organization proposed , if sanctioned by Congress , would require , within a very few years , for deposit as security for circulation , bonds of the United States to an amount not less than $250,000,000 . It may well he expected , indeed , since the circulation , by uniformity in credit and value , and capacity of quick and cheap transportation , will he likely to he used more extensively than any hitherto issued , that the demand for bonds will overpass this limit . Should Congress see fit to restrict the privilege of deposit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last session , the de* mancl would promptly absorb all of that description already issued and make large room for more . A steady market for The bonds would thus he established and the negotiation of them greatly facilitated . But it is not in immediate results that the value of this support would he only or chiefly seen . There are always holders who desire to sell securities of whatever kind . If buyers are few or uncertain , the market value must decline . But the plan proposed would create a constant demand , equalling and often exceeding the supply . Thus a steady uniformity in price would be // maintained , and generally at a rate somewhat above those of bonds of equal credit , but not available to banking associations . It is not easy to appreciate the full benefits of such conditions to a government obliged to borrow . Another advantage to be derived from such associations would be found in the convenient agencies which they would furnish for the deposit of public moneys . The Secretary does not propose to interfere with the independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assistant treasurers already established in the most important cities , where the customs may be collected as now , in coin or treasury notes issued directly by the Government , but not furnished to banking associations . But whatever the advantages of such arrangements in the commercial cities in relation to customs , it seems clear that the secured national circulation furnished to the banking associations should be received everywhere for all other dues than customs , and that these associations will constitute the best and safest depositaries of the revenues derived from such receipts . The convenience and utility to the Government of their employment in this capacity , and often , also , as agents for payments and as distributors of stamps , need no demonstration . The necessity for some other depositaries than surveyors of ports , receivers , postmasters , and other officers , of whose responsibilities and fitness , in many cases , nothing satisfactory can be known , is acknowledged by the provision for selection by the Secretary contained in the internal revenue act and it seems very clear that the public interest will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations organized as proposed than by any official selection . Another and very important advantage of the proposed plan has already been adverted to . It will reconcile , as far as practicable , the interest of existing institutions with those of the whole people . All changes , however important , should be introduced with caution , and proceeded in with careful regard to every affected interest . Rash innovation is not less dangerous than stupefied inaction . The time has come when a circulation of United States notes , in some form , must be employed . The people demand uniformity in currency , and claim , at least , part of the benefit of debt without interest , made into money , hitherto enjoyed exclusively by the banks . These demands are just and must be respected . But there need be no sudden change ; there need be no hurtful interference with existing interests . As yet the United States note circulation hardly fills the vacuum caused by the temporary withdrawal of coin ; it does not , perhaps , fully meet the demand for increased circulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of payments in money . There is opportunity , therefore , for the wise and beneficial regulation of its substitution for other circulation . The mode of substitution , also , may be judiciously adapted to actual circumstances . The plan suggested consults both purposes . It contemplates gradual withdrawal of bank note circulation , and proposes a United States note circulation , furnished to banking associations , in the advantages of which they may participate in full proportion to the care and responsibility assumed and the services performed by them . The promptitude and zeal with which many of the existing institutions came to the financial support of the Government in the dark days which followed the outbreak of the rebellion is not forgotten . They ventured largely , and boldly , and patriotically on the side of the Union and the constitutional supremacy of the nation over States and citizens . It does not at all detract from the merit of the act that the losses , which they feared but unhesitatingly risked , were transmuted into unexpected gains . It is a solid recommendation of the suggested plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reorganize , continue their business under the proposed act , and with little loss and much advantage , participate in maintaining the new and uniform national currency . The proposed plan is recommended , finally , by the firm anchorage it will supply to the union of the States . Every banking association whose bonds are deposited in the treasury of the Union ; every individual who holds a dollar of the circulation secured by such deposit ; every merchant , every manufacturer , every farmer , every mechanic , interested in transactions de // pendent for success on the credit of that circulation , will feel as an injury every attempt to rend the national unity , with the permanence and stability of which all their interests are so closely and vitally connected . Had the system been possible , and had it actually existed two years ago , can it be doubted that the national interests and sentiments enlisted by it for the Union would have so strengthened the motives for adhesion derived from other sources that the wild treason of secession would have been impossible ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blessing and debt a benefit ; but it is the duty of public men to extract good from evil whenever it is possible . The burdens of taxation may be lightened and even made productive of incidental benefits by wise , and aggravated and made intolerable by unwise , legislation . In like manner debt , by no means desirable in itself may , when circumstances compel nations to incur its obligations , be made by discreet use less burdensome , and even instrumental in the promotion of public and private security and welfare . The rebellion has brought a great debt upon us . It is proposed to use a part of it in such a way that the sense of its burden may be lost in the experience of incidental advantages . The issue of United States notes is such a use ; but if exclusive , is hazardous and temporary . The security by national bonds of similar notes furnished to banking associations is such a use , and is comparatively safe and permanent ; and with this use may be connected , for the present , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the use of the ordinary United States notes in limited amounts . No very early day will probably witness the reduction of the public debt to the amount required as a basis for secured circulation . Should no future wars arrest reduction and again demand expenditures beyond revenue , that day will , however , at length come . When it shall arrive the debt may be retained on low interest at that amount , or some other security for circulation may be devised , or , possibly , the vast supplies of our rich mines may render all circulation unadvisable except gold and the absolute representatives and equivalents , dollar for dollar , of gold in the treasury or on safe deposit elsewhere . But these considerations may be for another generation . The Secretary forbears extended argument on the constitutionality of the suggested system . It is proposed as an auxiliary to the power to borrow money ; as an agency of the power to collect and disburse taxes ; and as an exercise of the power to regulate commerce , and of the power to regulate the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing need be said . The argument relating to them was long since exhausted , and is well known . Of the other two there is not room , nor does it seem needful to say much . If Congress can prescribe the structure , equipment , and management of vessels to navigate rivccs flowing between or through different States as a regulation of commerce , Congress may assuredly determine what currency shall be employed in the interchange of their commodities , which is the very essence of commerce . Statesmen who have agreed in little else have concurred in the opinion that the power to regulate coin is , in substance and effect , a power to regulate currency , and that the framers of the Constitution so intended . It may well enough be admitted that while Congress confines its regulation to weight , fineness , shape , and deviee , banks and individuals may issue notes for currency in competition with coin . But it is difficult to conceive by what process of logic the unquestioned power to regulate coin can be separated from the power to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private or corporate substitutes which affect its value , whenever Congress shall see fit to exercise that power for that purpose . The recommendations , now submitted , of the limited issue of United States notes as a wise expedient for the present time , and as an occasional expedient for future times , and of the organization of banking associations to supply circulation secured by national bonds and convertible always into United States notes , and after resumption of specie payments , into coin , are prompted by no favor to excessive issues of any description of credit money . Ott the contrary , it is the Secretary 's firm belief that by no other path can the resumption of specie payments be so surely reached and so certainly maintained . United States notes receivable for bonds bearing a secure specie inter-9 , // eat are next best to notes convertible into Coin . The circulation of banking associations organized under a general act of Congress , secured by such bonds , can be most surely and safely maintained at the point of certain convertibility into coin . If , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes , resumption of specie payments will not thereby be delayed or endangered , but hastened and secured ; for , just as soon as victory shall restore peace , the ample revenue , already secured by wise legislation , will enable the Government , through advantageous purchases of specie , to replace at once large amounts , and , at no distant day , the whole , of this circulation by coin , without detriment to any interest , but , on the contrary , with great and manifest benefit to all interests . The Secretary recommends , therefore , no mere paper money scheme , but , . on the contrary , a series of measures looking to a safe and gradual return to gold and silver as the only permanent basis , standard , and measure of values recognized by the Constitution-between which and an irredeemable paper currency , as he believes , tbe choice is now to be made . ' Congress , however , was still unwilling to adopt the recommendations of the Secretary , until the necessity was demonstrated by the course of events . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Appendix , it will be found , that the great features of the system of the Secretary were as follows : 1 . A Joan to the Government upon its bonds reimbursable in twenty years but redeemable after five years , at the option of the nation , the interest being six per ceiit. , payable semi-annually in coin , as is also the principal . 2 . The issue of United States legal tender notes , receivable for all dues to the nation except customs , and fundable in this United States 5-20 six per cent . stock . 8 . The authorization of the banks recommended in his Report , whose circulation would be secured not only by private capital , but by adequate deposits of United States stock with the Government . 4 . To maintain , in the meantime , as near to specie as practicable , this Federal Currency ,  --  lst , by making it receivable in all dues to the Government except for customs ; 2d , by the privilege of funding it in United States stock ; 3d , by enhancing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock , both principal and interest , payable in specie , but by making it gradually the ultimate basis of our whole bank circulation , which , as shown by the census tables before referred to ( including deposits ) , nearly doubles every decade . 5 . By imposing such a tax on the circulation of the State banks , as , together with State or municipal taxes , would induce them to transfer their capital to the new banks proposed by the Secretary . 6 . To relieve the new lxen7cs from all State or municipal taxation . 7 . Ia lieu thereof , to impose a moderate Federal tax on all bank circulation , as a bonus to be paid cheerfully by these banks for the great privilege of furnishing ultimately the whole paper currency of the country , and the other advantages secured by these bills . This tax , as proposed by the Secretary , was one per cent . semi-annually , which in effect would have reduced the interest on our principal loans from all to four per cent , per annum , so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Congress , however , fixed this tax at about one halg thus making the interest on such loans equivalent in fact to five per cent , per annum , so far as such loans , at the option of the holder , are made the basis of banking and of bank circulation . This is a privilege which gives great additional value to these loans , for the right to issue the bank paper circulation of the country free from State or municipal taxes , is worth far more than one half per cent . semi-annually , to be paid bn such circulation . That this privilege is worth more than the Federal tax , is // proved by the fact , that many banks are already being organized under this system , and by the further fact , that more than $200,000,000 of legal tenders have already been funded in this stock , and the process continues at the rate of from one to two millions of dollars a day . It will be observed , that the holders of such bonds can keep them , if they please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity , as well as the semi-annual interest , in gold , free from all taxes . This system has been attended with complete success , and notwithstanding the increase of our debt , the premium on gold , for our Federal currency , fundable in this stock , has fallen from 73 per cent , in February last , before the adoption of Mr. Chase 's system , to 27 per cent . at present ; and before the 30th of June next , it is not doubted that this premium must disappear . No loyal American doubts the complete suppression of the rebellion before that date , in which event , our Federal currency will rise at once to the par of gold . In the meantime , however , gold is at a premium of 27 per cent. , which is the least profit ( independent of future advance above par ) so soon to be realized by those purchasing this currency now , and waiting its appreciation , or investing it in our United States 5-20 six per cent . stock . But , besides the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its other advantages are great indeed . It will ultimately displace our whole State bank system and circulation , and give us a national currency , based on ample private capital and Federal stocks , a currency of uniform value throughout the country , and always certainly convertible on demand into coin . Besides , by displacing the State bank circulation , the whole bank note currency of the Union will be based on the stocks of the Government , and give to every citizen who holds the bonds or the currency ( which will embrace the whole community in every State ) , a direct interest in the maintenance of the Union . The annual losses which our people sustain under the separate State bank system , in the rate of exchange , is enormous , whilst the constant and ever-recurring insolvency of so many of these institutions , accompanied by eight general bank suspensions of specie payment , have , from time to time , spread ruin and devastation throughout the country . I believe that , in a period of twenty years , the saving to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new system , would reach a sum very nearly approaching the total amount of our public debt , and in time largely exceeding it . As a question , then , of national wealth , as well as national unity , I believe the gain to the country in time by the adoption of the new system , will far exceed the cost of the war . It was the State bank system in the rebel States that furnished to secession mainly the sinews of war . These banks are now generally insolvent , but , if the banking system now proposed had been in existence , and the circulating medium in all the States had been an uniform national currency based entirely on the stocks of the United States , the rebellion could never have occurred . Every bank , and all its stockholders , and all the holders of the stock and notes of all the banks , embracing our whole paper currency , would have been united to the Government by an interest so direct and universal , that rebellion would have been impossible . Hamilton and Madison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , have declared that to the Federal Government belongs the entire regulation of the currency of the country . ' That power they have now exercised in the adoption of the system recommended by the Secretary . Our whole currency , in coin as well as paper , will soon , now , all be national , which is the most important measure for the security and perpetuity of the Union , and the welfare of the // Voicele. *s iS'inger8. people , ever adopted by Congress . It is to Congress that the Constitution grants the exclusive power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and among the States ; ' and a sound , uniform currency , in coin , or convertible on demand into coin , is one of the most essential instrumentalities connected with trade and exchanges . After these preliminary remarks , I shall proceed with the discussion of the subject in my next letter .
