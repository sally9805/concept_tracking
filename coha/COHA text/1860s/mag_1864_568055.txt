ARTICLE VIIJ. -A NEW WORK BY THE AUTHOR OF THORNDALE . Gravenknr8t : or Thoughts on Good and Evil . By WILLIAM SMITH , Author of " Thorndale , " etc . William Blackwood &amp; Sons , Edinburgh and London . 1862 . Post Svo. pp. 356 . SOME of the American readers of " Thorndale " may not know that the author has followed it by another work , in somewhat the same vein or direction of thought . There is this striking difference between the two-that the one exhibits the Conflict of opinions , without attempting to adjust the strife , while the other seeks to bring these opinions to Harmony . The first describes with boldness and freshness the various types of opinion on the most momentous themes which agitate the minds of the thinking men of these times , leaving the reader to his own resources in deciding which should prevail-furnishing , at the most , only some tentative efforts , outlines , or preliminary studies , which might aid in a right decision . The second furnishes us with a scheme of doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author , uttered after much reading and thought . The style and manner of the two volnines are appropriate to the contents of each . The first is more dramatic and e*citing ; the second is more calm and judicial . There are in both the same attractive features of style and imagery . Both abound in passages of elaborate , yet natural description . There breathes in both the same genial and tender human sympathies , tempered with calm and considerate reflectkrn . In both , there are abstract propositions and re*sonings , and also animated and well sustained conversations , conducted by a few personages who are clearly conceived and successfully individualized . The scene is at Gravenhurst , a retired English village , in the description of which the author displays those remarkably graphic powers which make his pictures of landscape to stand forth from the written page , drawn in outlines so sharp and yet // so delicate , and invested with colors so soft and yet so glowing , that yon can almost behold the scene with the bodily eye . The principal characters are these-Mansfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his niece ; and Sanford , who personates the author . To these personages of the conversations , are now and then introduced the vicar of Gravenhurst , who represents the moderate and not nuphilosophical defender of Christianity , as somewhat modified by modern thinking , and not refusing to give an account of itself to earnest inquirers after the truth . We can not deny our readers the pleasure of perusing the following passage : " Let me stop to observe that if there are moody reasoners who think it fit to express nothing but commiseration for the lives of men battered in the business and rascality of the world , even these will confess that there is something to admire , and a theme for gratulation , in some fair European girl or woman on whom has been showered wealth , beauty , and intelligence , when I see , for instance , a young English girl , full of grace and full of energy withal , dismount from her favorite horse , which she does not quit without a fond and grateful pattin* , of the neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more or less elegantly furnished , supplied with books of a thoughtful character , which are really read , and perhaps with instruments of music that are skillfully played upon , I think I have before me one of the most highly-finished , certainly one of the most significant , products of our civilization . I suppose that a learned jurist or a profound divine would cite themselves , or cite each other , as loftier examples of humanity-as higher types of European culture . I must be permitted to de* mur . I grant , indeed , that either of them may be a shade wiser than the English damsel of nineteen , and many shades more learned ; but it is a newer wonder in the world that there should be many damsels of nineteen intelligent and wise , than that there should be learned lawyers and deep divines . And when I think that the mental cultivation has not disturbed one natural grace or one maidenly virtue-when I think of the blooming health and exquisite play of every limb and feature  --  the vivid emotions , the keen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , that distinguish my English girl-I must pronounce her altogether the far higher creation . Yes , a greater boast of the age than all its chancellors , and even all its bishops ! " Such a charming English girl , you would have said , was Ada Neweome . There came , however , one bitterness in her lot , which marred the picture I have to draw . " I call to mind the first time I saw Ada Newcome . It is now some years ago , but I remember it as vividly as if it were yesterday . She passed me ( I was on the way to her house ) sitting upon her horse . A more light and graceful figure , or a better rider , I thought I had never beheld . The sli* , ht figure sat balanced so perfectly , and swayed so harmoniously with every movement of the high-spirited // yet gentle-hearted animal , that you looked on with unalloyed pleasure , and without one moment 's anxiety for her safety . If her fleet Arabian should give himself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if she were one of the winds herself . I see her rein up that proud Arabian ; I see her dismount at her own door ; she caresses the beautiful creature , who bends down his head to meet the caressing hand . I perceive his eye brightens as he feels that the eye of his mistress is on him . It rests on him with something of a tender gratitude , and there is some unspoken sadness mingling with her fond caress . She leaves the horse and proceeds to walk up the wide old-fashioned staircase of the ancient family house she inhabits . But what is this ? What change has come over my beautiful picture ? Can it be the same figure which I saw a moment ago , light and buoyant as the air , that I now see dragging itself slowly and painfully up those stairs-one hand , sometimes both , clinging to the banisters for aid ? Ada is lame  --  the result , I believe , of some early accident-hopelessly lame . Well might she love that horse ! Seated on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; descended to the earth , one limping and disabled limb mars all . At each slow step the fair figure drops sideways-is broken-sinks and rises , as if each step were a fall and a recovery . The balance is recovered , to be directly lost again . She adVances up the stairs as children do , putting always the same foot foremost , and bringing the other up to it . And when the stairs are accomplished , the level surface that remains to be traversed makes the plunging , broken gait still more conspicuous ; our lily threatens to snap at every instant . " pp* 45-49 . The book is made up of an Introduction , in which the author describes his scene , introduces his personages , announces his themes , and proposes his method . This is followed by Part I. The Exposition : in live chapters , under the following titlesPain and Painful Emotion ; Too much Evil ; Moral Evil ; Remediable Evils , or Man Progressive ; The Irremediable . Part H. Conversation&amp; : consists of familiar discussions between the dramatis personce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Happiness ; Crime and its Punishment ; The Rationale of Punishment ; The Rainbow , or Suffering an Element in our Highest Forms of Mental Life ; The Development of Human Society . inseparable from Contest and IDivision ; Explanatory Hints on Several Topics ; The Whole is One . It will be surmised , at once , from these titles , that the author has grappled with some of the toughest subjects of human speculation , and has ventured , in his way , to give a Theodicy or a vindication of the ways of God to man in the permission of physical and moral evil . // The theory of the author is peculiar , and though by no means novel or original in some of its single features or positions , it is worthy of attention from the ingenuity and interest with which these features are combined . We turn to Chapter III . of " The Exposition " on Moral Evil , and find the following ethical definition : " That which amongst animals , or idiots , is mere hurt or injury , becomes moral evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the interests of society or the presumed judgments of God . Evil , therefore , becomes moral evil-how ? by the development of human reason . And a pleasure-giving act becomes Moral Goodness by the same development of intelligence . The intentional acts of men become moral evil because they are performed or contemplated by beings capable of moral judgments . " This doctrine is sufficiently intelligible . The author 's definition of moral evil needs no addition to make it clear and explicit . The act or intention of causing pain or pleasure which is performed without intelligence , is simply harmful or wholesome , undesirable or desirable . When performed by one who can judge of its relations and its tendency , it becomes morally good or bad . The differentia is intelligence , which , being present , converts natural into moral evil ; or , in the author 's own language , " evil becomes moral evil by the addition of these judgments . " Observe , here , that the author implies , though lie does not distinctly assert , that this is the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new element than that of intelligence is needed to transform the naturally harmful into the morally malicious , or the malevolent . He intends this , however , and would not hesitate to affirm it if asked . The reader can not , however , do justice to the author 's view , or enter fully into the import of his definition , unless he adverts distinctly to the fact that the author is a philosophical necessitarian , and rejects entirely the opinion that freedom or the exercise of the will is necessary to invest an action with moral quality . Upon the back ground of this assumption he projects his entire theory of the evolution of moral quality , and of the possibility of moral judgments . He does not , indeed , give to this matter of the // 163 will any great prominence in the present volume , though he discusses it briefly in one of the Conversations . He is too earnest and too honest to be guilty of any disguise or any intended subreption of thought . That he does hold this view , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to judge of the import and reach of his analysis of moral good and evil . Mr. Sn*ith , then , holds that a naturally useful or harmful action-meaning by act , of course , a spiritual feeling , wish , or desire , and not corporeal exercise only-becomes virtuous or vicious when performed by a being who can judge of its nature . No matter how he comes by the wish or desire , if he only has an intellect sufficiently developed to be able to judge of certain relations of the wish , the wish or feeling is thereby rendered right or wrong . In this opinion , we remark , in passing , he has the happiness or the misfortune to agree with not a few theologians of the more rigorous type , such as teach that sin may pertain to the natural constitution , or pass over by inheritance from parent to child , or ancestor to posterity , or enter into the generic unity of the race to be thence evolved undethe law of regular development , all agreeing , ho**ever , with the author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligence to qualify the person to be morally responsible . As all these theological philosophers are somehow constrained to believe and to admit that the feeling or desire must also , in some sense , belong to the person who is intellectually qualified to judge of it , so , we observe , that our author , perhaps madvertently , uses the epithet " intentional " as an attribute or an accompaniment of the acts in question . We submit that " intentional " can not here signify " intelligent ; " but that there lies hid beneath , an , as it were , extorted concession , that some other relation of the act must be involved than that which it holds to the intellect only . Intentional , when used in such a connection , seems to us to signify , not merely " known in its real relations , " " rightly judged , " " intelligently conceived , " but " indulged notwithstanding it is clearly known , " " deliberately chosen , " " voluntarily designed . " In short , we think that Mr. Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , is no unusual phenomenon . // But leaving this point , we proceed a pace further and ask , or rather Mr. Smith answers , and thus really asks the question for us , what is it , that the intelligence judges to be morally good or evil ,  --  and how is it that it is qualified to pronounce upon the act as right or wrong ? We must confess that we were surprised , if not startled , at his answer : " It is because we have to check and regulate both ourselves and each other , that there is such a thing as morality at all . No theorem in Euclid is more clear than this , that moral good and evil start into existence together . Reason and conscience are themselves developments from the experience of the good and evil of life . The moment reason and conscience are thus developed , good and evil have become moral good and moral evil . The creation of man as a moral being involves the necessity of moral evil . " This Thesis he thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spontaneously from instinct or perfectly balanced passions , there would be no room for the development of the moral sentiments . Conscience would be latent and undeveloped . If you suppose a race all and each uniformly and energetically impelled to act for the best good of the whole , there would be no moral approbation , because there would be no law by which such perfect conduct could be tried or measured , and in view of conformity to which , there might be self-approval . Law is elicited by the antagonism of impulse or unbalanced passion to the well-being of society . This awakens reaction on the 4 part of those iffended , which is expressed in the form of law enforced by the approbation or disapprobation of others . Even should there be irregularity enough to elicit law , and then after law were called into being , the passions of men were to be calmed by and adjusted to this newly developed regulating force , even then there could be no sustained moral sentiments and moral judgments ; or in the author 's own words , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a state of things , when all would be equally obedient to the moral law , there could be any feeling of merit , any glow of virtue , any praise given or received . " In other words , the author must hold that not only to the development of moral law , there must be necessarily moral evil , but in order to its perfection there must // be the repetition of various forms of moral evil so as to call out the reprobation of law in that variety , which is necessary to make the law complete . So also in order to sustain the moral code , in distinct recognition and active force , there must be the constant recurrence of offenses against it . In this way it is that the author seeks to make good his paradox that " the creation of man as a moral being involves the necessity of moral evil . " We do not care to examine how the author meets the views of those who would oppose his own by another ethical theory , or who ask how God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It may be that he successfully sets aside all the theories and objections of others which he brings into the field , particularly if his version of these theories and ob*jections is to be accepted as precisely just . We prefer to call attention to the defects of his own theory . Its first defect is that it leaves out of view the Will as the ground of moral responsibility . A better psychology would have furnished the materials for a more profound and accurate ethical analysis . An " intentional " act is more than an act which is simply intelligent . Second : the moral code or the moral law , which the author contemplates , is simply the code or law which relates to external actions and their relation to human welfare . If we ask what we are to do , in order to bless mankind , we must learn very largely , we have no objection to saying wholly , from experience , what are the consequences or tendencies of our doing8 in respect to human welfare . But if we ask what we ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of knowing , that we ought to intend , i. e. to voluntarily desire their welfare . It is one thing to know the superiority of benevolent love to selfish hatred , and quite another thing to learn what are the actions , the doings , or even the special wishings and desirings to which benevolence and love would prompt . The last is taught by experience , and it is because it is taught by experience that the moral code is continually advancing , and may never , be complete . But the first of these may not be dependent on experience at all ; or if so , it is an experience which is purely spiritual and subjective , one which is equally within reaclm of the infant as of the instructed sage . Third : the author confounds the occasions under which // the attention of the human race is called to moral distinctions and made acquainted with moral rules , with the elementary constituents into which the rule as objective , and the judgment concerning it as subjective , are resolvable . If it be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply moral distinctions to itself , on some occasion when it has opposed the wish of a parent , yet it by no means follows that the conformity or non-conformity of our conduct to time expressed or imagined will of others is all that time mind is or might be awakened to discern . The oversight in respect to this distinction , committed by the author , is the same of which Hobbes , and Locke , and Adam Smith , have been guilty in their ethical theories . We are surprised that a writer of his penetration , insight , and comprehensive knowledge , should not have avoided this error . It may not be easy to adjust the proportion which belongs to the rational and the experiential , but it certainly is not in keeping with the superior gifts and discrimination of the author of " Thorudale , " who so fully acknowledges this distinction in other applications , to lose sight of it wholly , when he is called to use it in respect to relations which are so fundamental and all important as those of the conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have considered why in the conduct of man 's history , and in the development of man 's being , the development of the moral judgments and feelings into actual consciousness and universal acknowledgincut should have been left so largely to these external circumstances-why conscience , in the case of so many individuals , and of so many communities , should so generally seem to be the aftEr-growth of crime and sin , and the moral law , not only in its external relations , but even in its spiritual and subjective application , should have been wrought out by the always painful and the som etimes terrific experiments of time individual and social evils which have followed transgression . The Christian theory of a grand moral economy-embracing all the generations of the race , and yet not overlooking a single individual-contemplating the moral recovery of many , through appropriate moral and spiritual influences , would , if accepted by the author , explain why the moral experiences of men should // follow the order which they do , beginning with the outward and working inward-beginning with the education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , by its instruction and discipline , awaleen8 but does not create the conscience ; stimulates to the exercise of the moral nature , but does not thereby furnish its constituent elements . We have not room to follow out the applications which the author makes of his principles to the vindication of the ways of God . It is not necessary that we should . If his analysis of the prime elements of moral good and evil is fundamentally defective , his applications of them can not but be unsatisfactory to the consecutive and consistent thinker . That they are most unsatisfactory to the feelings , we need not say . It gives little relief to the earnest and troubled inquirer , to be told that in bodily pain , in sickness , in sorrow , and in death , there is this , and this only " soul of goodness , " that they stimulate to noble doing and daring , and that in acting and bearing the soul feels itself to be strong . Still less are we satisfied with the doctrine that God must allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the inquiry springs at once to the thoughts , what so great good is there in having a conscience at such a price ? Why not endow the race with unconscious natural goodness , if we can only be conscious of moral worth by the experience of moral guilt ? Still less are we satisfied with the theory of Divine punishment which does not recognize the prevention of sin as its end , but makes it necessary that the Creator should create the sin which he punishes , and create it continually in order that he may keep alive the moral law , according to which he condemns . The author has evidently been led to adopt these extraordinary theories by the reaction of his own mind against the very vague and unsatisfying ethical and theological defenses of the Christian system which he has happened to encounter . But his heart seems to revolt against the logical conclusions to which his philosophy seems to impel him . Indeed , if we are not greatly mistaken , it is this conflict between his better convictions and sympathies on the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make from his too // scanty conceptions and too narrow assumptions-it is the presence of this conflict which imparts an almost dramatic interest to the Conversations which constitute the larger part of the volume . In these Conversations he seems all the while to be lingering upon the objectioDs which may be urged against his views . He is ever desirous to do full justice to all that may be said or suggested in reply , and his own feelings seem to cleave to the construction of the topic that is more in harmony with the ordinary faith of men . Hence the eloquence with which the pleadings for the old faith are uttered by the warm-hearted Ada Neweomne , and the apparent candor and truthfulness of many of the protestations of the Vicar of Gravenhurst . A kindly father of another age might say , in a pardonable conceit , of these two tendencies , that the philosophy of the author was Naomi stoically obeying the voice bidding her go back to the desolate mountains of Moab , while his promptings to faith were the voice of the reluctant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope toward the land of promise and of peace . We began this notice of Gravenhurst , thinking to give a brief outline of its contents . We have been beguiled into these somewhat extended remarks by the interest of its principal theme . We can not describe the interesting discussions , with the delightful pictures by which they are relieved , the eloquent discoursings which are constantly returning , the appo - site illustrations w4hich are so beautifully introduced , and the perfect style in which all these beauties are enshrined . To attempt to do this without copious extracts would be in vain , and for neither description nor extracts have we time or room . As we read these pages , we are reminded of a beautiful and inviting arbor overhung with a luxuriant vine and fragrant with the breath of flowers , decorated so beautifully within and without that for the leafy luxuriance we can not see the bare and deformed structure of feeble scantling over which this covering is drawn , and of which it is at once the support and the ornament . One push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this stately edifice for shelter and delight , will fall ; yet still the beauty that made it attractive , in its seeming strength , will remain to decorate the prostrate ruin .
