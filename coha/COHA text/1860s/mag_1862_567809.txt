NEW ENGLANDER . No . LXXIX . APRIL , 1862 . ARTICLE 1. - BUCKLE 'S HISTORY OP CIVILIZATION . Iii 8tory of Civilization . By HENRY THOMAS BUCKLE . 2 Vols . New York : ID . Appleton &amp; Co. 1861. 8vo. pp. 677 , 476 . BUCKLE 'S History of Civilization in England is a specimen work of the best and worst results of modern science . Its high generalizations , its many indubitable and far-reaching principles , its broad and often careful comparison of facts , and its connection of these in causal relations openin* , up civilization in its effective forces , , constitute it a work of great labor and value . So fortuitous has the action of man seemed , so accidental in its governing circumstances , that not till science had gained confidence and experience in departments more obviously subject to law , did it dare to advance upon history , or was it able to displace narrative with philosophy , the naked connections of time with the sequence of events issuing in order from known causes . In this field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the results are such as to enable him justly to magnify the work in hand , to invite to YOL . XXI. 12 // its completion sound and patient science , and to commend his own efforts to the candor of an appreciative criticism . This book in its spirit belongs to that Positive Philosophy which finds a distinguished advocate in Comte . Let us not uiiderrate the value of this positive method . In what it accepts , it commands our respect , in what it scornfully refuses , it provokes our scorn . The physical bias , which thought early received in England , aud later in France , while it has been the source of most manifest external advantages and a quickened civilization , has also occasioned , by its inadequate and partial tendency , not merely an oversight , but an absolute denial of important mental phenomena , and a supercilious contempt of all questions and investigations not immediately within its own prescribed path . This positive spirit has much of the dogmatism which it ostentatiously despises , arrogates to itself the term science , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be foolish , because annoyed by these extravagant claims , to underrate our indebtedness to its patient investigations of physical forces . While many of the peculiar features of modern civilization are obviously due to this spirit , not all that is best and most potent in the present is referable to this method , and much that is barren and degrading has accompanied its too broad and exclusive application . Matter has overpowered mind , and the methods and principles applicable in the investigation of the first have been unphilosophically carried over to the second . The effort has been made to subject mind to the same species of causation which reigns in matter , and the peculiar powers , *by which it rises above the sphere of the strictly natural , have thereby been either degraded , denied , or overlooked . Nothing can be looked for in the higher department of mental philosophy from a method which makes physical truth the complete type of knowledge , and sneeringly groups all beyond under the now opprobrious title of mataphysical ; or , if this fails to fill the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theological . The effect of such a method on religion is most obvious and inevitable . While theology has nothing to fear from natural science , and is , at times , signally strengthened by it , its most needful auxiliary is correct , mental philosophy . All that subordinates // man to nature , or weakens the spiritual element , will quickly show itself in religious faith , banishing what is distinctly supernatural and redemptive , and rapidly narrowing it down to the dead formula of physical law . The God of the Bible will be rejected , and his place left vacant , or supplied by the god of science , who is little more than the last of its generalizations . Now this is the result , not of just , but of one-sided and so far delusive science . Man is not bound to nature , nor measured by nature . This fact is the basis of religion , and a philosophy that does not broadly recognize it , of inherent necessity , becomes irreligious . How can such a method as develops itself in Darwin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irreligious ,  --  a method which systematically rejects everything but physical causation , and grafts man with all his high capabilities on the stock of natural forces , which have gone before him ? Man so rooted in earth , growing out of the earth and fed on the earth , can neither require nor find that spiritual element , that supernatural aliment which Christianity furnishes . The whole spirit of the Bible is in direct antagonisni to this spirit . There , all is intervention , suspension , the us of the lower by the higher ; here , all is law , inexorable , universal , not less for the higher than for the lower . Every personal element is driven back to the remotest points or utterly excluded . No such philosophy can breathe freely or move unconstramnedly till it has learned either to forget or despise revelation , and we frequently find in this class of writers a complete oversight of the real or apparent conflict of their theories with inspiration . They are checked no more by Scripture records than by pagan mythologies . To this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellencies and his faults . We find in him , indeed , a liberal and just estimation of intellectual forces , yet , in the same connection , that systematic depreciation of moral and religious influences which marks his relations . One of the most satisfactory chapters is that on " The infin - ence exercised by physical laws over the organization of society , and over the character of individuals . " Yet , the facts // here established plainly point , we think , to the necessity of a moral force wherewith to meet and rule external tendenciesa force whereby man in all climates and conditions is made the master , and not the slave , of nature . Undoubtedly , the easy conditions of mere life , and the consequent abundance and subsequent depression of life on such a soil and in such a climate as those of India , render the conflict between man and external physical forces more severe and adverse to the former , than in Europe ; yet , there are latent moral forces in man which , fully developed , will not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find their advantage in it . Man is first his own slave , and then the slave of the world . A fallen monarch becomes even more abject than his former subjects . Amid the excellencies of this discussion , we miss a recognition of the latent energy of moral manhood . This is not to us a word or a phantom , but a fact , rare it may he , yet as effective and startling when it does appear as the most demonstrative natural law . While speaking of the merits of the work , we can not omit the fullness with which the causes of the French Revolution are traced , and still more the able treatment of the protective system . The relation of government to civilization , we apprehend , is rightly rendered . Because a good government is an early fruit and first requisite of civilization , much more has been ascribed to its influence , and a stricter dependence upon it by the people been thought to exist , than the facts in the case show . Good government is less an antecedent than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final cause . Its office is rather to conserve what has been wrought out and intrusted to it , than to enlarge it . It is even too much to expect that it will often be able to recognize and favor the legitimate expression of the great principles incorporated in it . Civil institutions have rarely sufficient elasticity to suffer the needful growth of liberty . The duty assigned them is so habitually that of stern maintenance of constitutional law , that they are seldom prepared for the new issues of time , or possess that greatness which , without predilection , adjudicates between e old and the new . Almost all progress has the necessity of // revolution forced upon it by the resistance of government . Indeed , a certain measure of resistance must ever belong to an authority which would sustain itself , and thrust back fickle changes , till they are resolved into irrepressible principles . iRarely will there be found in any government that *tran*e wisdom which seizes the right moment to pass from resistance to concession ; which pushes reform to its proof ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government been over-estimated in the amount that has been entrusted to it , and expected from it . iReligion , literature , commerce , the mechanical arts , have been regarded as the foundlings of government . Nothing could prosper save in the sunshine of its patronage . The people , unable to guide themselves or watch over their own interests , were in helpless dependence , to be sheltered under its protection , and led in and out like a flock . This whole notion of the extended and parental function of the ruler , of a king , as the father of his people , sprang from the ignorance and consequent weakness of subjects . Civilization shows itself instantly in a resumption of power by those to whom it belongs . The people have thus become the source of religion and of literature , and their uncurbed enterprise , the ruling power of commerce . The ruler is now a public servant , doing that , and that only , which the people leave to him or lay upon him . So far as community is organic by natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government is suppressed , and those labors alone left it which , by necessity , fall to civil law . Thus , umore and m9re , the truth is recognized , that that is the best government which is content to supplement natural forces , and preserve the conditions of their freest action . Thus , in religion , faith becomes all that it can religiously be , the faith of the individual . In art and literature , a free , catholic , and creative spirit is received , whence alone it can be fully received , from human nature , opened up in the diverse and multitudinous life of man . Composition thins escapes the private stamp , which the patronage of a class is wont to affix , and becomes strictly literature , the voice of man to man . In mechanical and commercial enterprise , the power of private interest is left // to expend , unembarrassed , its full force , and government sinks to an instrument , one among the many institutions of a civilized people . We now pass to some of the faults @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Positive Philosophy , to which , in spirit at least , it belongs . The tendency to materialism , if nowhere avowed , is at many points present . It shows itself in the use of the terms , theological and metaphysical , in a meaning akin to that in which they are employed by Comnte . The last designates all that is wild and futile in theory , and the first all that is credulous and fanciful in belief . The one covers those superstitions which , iii the view of the author , make up the religion of the world ; the other , those speculations which make up its philosophy . Thus , in the first chapter , the doctrine of predestination is assigned to theology , and that of free will to philosophy , and both set aside as beyond the province of knowledge . The ground being thus cleared , neither the will of God or of man opposing any farther obstacle , the author is ready to occupy the vacant field with immediate , efficient causes , reaching with the certainty of natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an effort is rendered farther probable by the statistics of murder , suicide , and marriage ; each of these exhibit a regularity which indicates settled causation . Thence it is " inferred that the good actions of men , which are , as it were , the residue of their bad ones , vary in the same manner , and are the result of large general causes , working upon the aggregate of society without regard to the volition of particular men . " So easy is it to disprove liberty . This class of philosophers always make short work with their opponents . They seem to think them ghostly phantoms of a buried past , that vanish at a look . We will not linger on the many provocative points of this first chapter . Its unsafe and rapid method is sufficiently shown in the fact , that free will is set aside by invalidating consciousness . As this is a pretty broad condition or foundation of knowledge , it is possible that even positive science may be involved // in its overthrow . A philosophy that plucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own faculties , should first make np its mind to perish in the ruins . We turn to " The comparison of moral and intellectual laws in their effect on society , "  --  a discussion in which the faults of the work appear in their most glowing form . The intellect is made , not merely the chief , but almost the sole , cause of progress . The principle argument by which this conclusion is reached admits of a concise statement . Progress is a variable effect . There arc two elciucuts in man to which it may be referred , the moral and the intellectual . The first has remained stationary : " Nothing is to be found in the world which has undergone so little change as those great dogmas of which moral systems are composed . To do good to others ; to sacrifice for their benefit your own wishes ; to love your neighbor as yourself ; to forgive your enemies ; to honor your parents ; to respect those who are set over you ; these and a few others are the sole essentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of years , and not one jot or tittle has been added to them . " The second has been constantly changing , and to this , the variable cause alone , therefore , can be referred the variable effect . If we were not fearful of falling into that class of credulous theologians and misty metaphysicians that have just been browbeaten , we should certainly be startled both by this assertion and argument . The teacher , however , of a new philosophy requires some boldness . A soldier that clears the way with a lwoad sword must do some rough dissecting , and it can not be possible that our practical philosopher , who always inquires what is found , and never predicts what will be found , is about to build his whole structure on a naked theory , a bare hypothesis , sustained by an assertion and a deduction alike false . We had a right to expect something better from one who had thrown down so much to make way for his own structure . Yet , does not that same blind hardihood , which makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole , it is no preparation for faith either in one 's methods or results , that he himself has found little valuable , // little trustworthy in those who have gone before him . Some men contribute much , no man contributes all ; the race amass together their common inheritance of knowledge . Let us weigh the premises of a conclusion so fundamental . The assertion , though broadly made , is in its spirit and effect utterly false . The truth which it contains is exceedingly restricted and partial . That some or all of these precepts may be found in " pagan authors , " is a fact much too narrow to sustain the ab*ve statement ; and what are we to think of the logic of an author who , on this ground , says : " The assertion that Christianity communicated to men moral truths previonsly unknown , argues either gross ignorance or willful fraud . " Ifaving gathered together with liberal interpretation the scattered precepts of the whole pagan world , known in their completeness and relations to none , and singly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fragmentary knowledge to a system which combines them all , gives them totally new relations and sanctions , and publishes them everywhere * We might , with the same justice , oppose to modern invention the blind hints which we find concerning them in lioger Bacon . There is no proof that there has ever been a single man to whom these precepts , as combined , related and vitalized by Christianity , would not have presented a wholly new system , on every side surpassing his own ; while the recognition by the great mass of men of these obligations is limited to , and dependent on , Christianity . No such morality as that contained in these principles is or has been current , ruling the lives of men , aside from a Christian faith . The principles of equality and universal love , if seen at all , will remain most barren* of results , till their true foundation is recognized in our common relations to God , and therein is found their available unpulse . The assertion , then , that Christianity brought nothing new is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approximatiovi to truth , when reference is had to man , to the mass of men . Precepts of fragmentary morality gathered from all parts of the pagan world as signally fail to make the Christian system , as the facts of Chaldean astrology to endure comparison with the similar facts of Newtonian astronomy , or as the uncurrent // knowledge of that time to equal the popular information of today . No more just is the assertion , that moral dogmas have sut&gt; fered no change . Morality always and everywhere has been chiefly dependent on religion for its sanctions , and , therefore , as a power in the world , it has been just as changeable as religion . Moral science , also , as a detached science , has not been stationary . Its precepts have , indeed , been more full and just than its theories , but the precept must always suffer in its authority , when sustained by an inadequate theory , such as that of utility . Now the relation of morality to man 's nature , its inherent authority and relative value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farthest from it . Pure morality , in its internal sanctions , has received much additional light , and waits toreceke more , as - long as nmn*s nature and his social relations remain a siiiibjec of investigation . Nor , if we grant the assertion on which it rests , is the argument just . These doctrines , however complete in themselves , have not been generally known or enforced in their practical and religious sanctions . It is of no avail to say that a doctrine has been stationary , unless we can add that its disscinination has been complete in all periods . An old truth , newly proclaimed , may be a most potent force in civilization . Such a force has Christian morality again and again been . Just here is developed the peculiar power of Christian truth . Unlike those faiths that have swept as a whirlwind over the earth , and then become either stationary or retrograde , it has waited the fullness of time , and secured to itself a new impulse when it *eemned least to promise it . A living thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth amid the vital forces of every spring . In the argum cut urged by Buckle , the moral stands opposed to the intellectual , and , therefore , includes the religious element . The tendency which it is intended to characterize and censure by the term metaphysical , as used in Positive Philosophy , is , we suppose , that which substitutes speculation for observation , a theory anticipating the facts for an induction carefully established on facts . Now , where can be found a better illustration // of the very method so censured , than this exclusion of the moral element at the very outset of an investigation of the forces of civilization , on the ground of an ill-founded a priori argument , that such a force is not variable , and can not be effective . We add this as another proof , that censuring a particular fault is not in itself sufficient evidence that the critic himself has escaped the error . All the facts of history , in which we everywhere see the moral clement strongly at work , are overridden by an alleged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to justify the censure which he afterward bestows upon religious influence . If moral forces are an exhausted element , powerless for good , it would seem but fair to dismiss them as also powerless for evil . Since the author has himself set us the example of arguing from T wnJatur* *6f the forces at work we may , without *eiisure , pursue this metaphysical inquiry a little further , and see if the intellect can be the chief , the almost sole element of progress . Knowledge is a means rather than an end . It gives scope and facility of gratification to old desires rather than imparts new ones . Like wealth , it is a species of power , but the way in which the power shall be employed must depend on the inherent impulses either of one 's physical , social , or religious nature . Casting out the moral element , we have nothing but appetites and passions to prompt to the acquisition or use of knowledge . We need not here mention the love of knowledge as knowledge , nor the love of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and with these subsequent , rather than prior , to civilization . We have , then , as impulses to progress , to choose between the appetites and passions on the one side , and , on the other , the moral forces of our nature . Intellectual culture can do nothing but lend power to these native forces . When the choice is to be thus distinctly made between passion and moral power as elements in progress , but very few will take the former . Appetite is ever tending to that excess , that luxury , and intemperance , which destroy the prosperity industry has achieved . Nor has it been found that mere prudence , which is all that intellect alone can supply , is sufficient to curb this wayward tendency . Thus is it with passion . Passion can alone be made // social , genial , benevolent , under moral restraint . Without this restraint , the arrogance , oppression , and consequent conflict of classes , precipitate revolution and ruin . The good of each is only sought in the good of all under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general good contains the highest individual good , is capable of proof by the intellect , no such proof will exist , or secure conviction , till civilization already exists , and therefore can not be the efficient cause of that civilization . Here we find a difficulty which belongs to most of the motives springing from pure intellect . They do not take effect till the work for which they are to serve has been accomplished . Unlike morality , they do not supply a force which reaches one in ignorance , and lifts hfrn out &amp;fi*n6ranee . All the discussions which follow are in keeping with this early disparagement of the religious element . Passages , like the following , mark , from time to time , the undercurrent of feeling : " After a careful study of the history and condition of barbarous nations , I do most confidently assert , that there is no well attested case of any people being permanently converted to Christianity , except in those very few instances where missionarie* , being men of knowledge as well as piety , have familiarized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulating his intellect , have prepared him for the reception of those religious principles which , without such stimulus , he could never have understood . It is in this way that , looking at things upon a large scale , the religion of mankind is the effect of their improvement , not the cause of it . " ( p. 185 . ) " Ye still see the extraordinary spectacle of prayers offered up in our churches for dry weather or for wet weather ; a superstition which , to future ages , will appear as childish as the feeling of pious awe with which our fathers regarded the presence of a comet . " ( p. 271 . ) " The clergy , as a body , have always been remarkable for their intolerance of opinions different to their own . " " The Protestant religion is , for the most part , more tolerant than the Catholic , simply because the events which have given rise to Protestantism have at the same time lijereased the play of the intellect , and therefore lessened the power of the clergy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This once formidable body ( speaking of the clergy ) does not now retain even a semblance of its ancient influence ; its resolutions are no longer feared , its discussions are no longer studied , and the business of the country continues to be conducted without regard to those interests which , only a few generations ago , were considered by every statesman to be of superior importance . " ( p. 298. ) // book , and there are several important tendencies manifested in them . The clergy are attacked because more vulnerable than the system which they uphold . Often very faulty in the form which they have given to faith , and striven to maintain for it , they always suffer censure with comparatively little violence to our religious convictions , and , at times , with a sense of justice which renders the rebuke wholesome . Many , however , availing themselves of the weakness of this human side of Christian faith , have directed indiscrimTh ate attacks against the clergy , which , in their spirit and practical effect , have been aimed *aLreiigiou itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utore *e*fully because of its partial truth . If* rightly apprehend the spirit of the present work , its bitterness against the clergy does not arise from their untiiithfalness to the truths committed to them , but from the fact that the religious power of which they are the exponents is an unwelcome one which , in the view of the author , will be greatly weakened or utterly overthrown by the progress of civilization . We have no zeal to defend the clergy . In some directions , we think them sadly open to censure , yet , so far as they are the depositaries of religion , and that religious force which is the only redemptive element in the world , they must receive the cordial support of every one who believes in a salvation , and waits for it . If the clergy , " as a body , are more intolerant than other men , " this intolerance would seem to be due to that which distinguishes them from other men , their religious relations . The implication , therefore , of this assertion is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obnoxious use of that word . This is very distinct from the assertion , for which it might be mistaken , that Christianity , partially received and applied , has often failed to overcome the natural intolerance of men , and has even become its most cruel instrument ; or , the assertion , that the very depth of conviction with which truth is accepted tends to beget a bigoted zeal for it . This inherent intolerance of the religious spirit is farther implied in refusing to recognize an obvious difference in this // respect between Catholicism and Protestantism , and attributing any superiority which may belong to the latter to its loss of power . If this be true , then religion , in its reform , in its very growth , and higher development , is at heart equally relentless , equally the stern antagonist of reason , and , therefore , forever the foe of civilization . The charge brought against it of a blind conservatism is no idle one . The action of those through whom religion expresses itself is not merely personal , but involves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the earlier of these extracts , there is again seen the relative importance assigned the religious element . Prayer is banished the physical world-  --  and as the author attributes to the intellectual world the same rigidity of laws , from this alsoas a ridiculous superstition of which a little more knowledge will make us heartily ashamed . Missionary labor , so far as efficient , is said to owe its success to instruction , and not to any moral power . This almost total unbelief in man 's moral nature , and consequent contempt of religious influences , and hostility to them as an obstinate and disturbing force , is the radical evil of the work . Other difficulties find their root in this , and this is of so fatal a character as to make a laborious and often most instructive work fruitful of mischief . The inexcusable and humiliating errors , into which the Positive Philosophy at once falls , are but a just retribution of the fool-hardy spirit with which its disciples despise all investigations but their own , and the self-confident way in which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counterparts of their own . They despise a priori reasoning , and yet no argument is more falsely a priori than that by which they carry the laws of matter into mind , and affirm that the last must be ruled by the same principles as the first . It would seem that their favorite method of observation might prepare them for a new organum when passing to phenomena so peculiar as those of mind . Though rejecting the new conditions of philosophy , and characterizing as metaphysical all those investigations which serve to reveal the nature and relation of // our mental powers , it would still seem that they might , in part , redeem their error by a correct interpretation of those historical facts which have arisen under these same powers , and which , therefore , exhibit their peculiar character . Here , also , we are disappointed . Having first determined , by a most faulty application of theory , that moral forces are nugatory , all facts are so interpreted as to sustain the idea . Thus they commit at once , in their most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their opponents . So many are the forces which affect a single action , so much is it involved in , and modified by , cotemporary events , that , in no department is misinterpretation so easy as in history . Notwithstanding this facility , it is certainly not an easy task to show that religion has exerted a secondary and unimportant influence in the world , or that Christianity has not been an efficient cause of modern civilization . The last point is the one on which we choose to linger . An element in making up our judgment of Christianity , is the influence it has actually exerted in past centuries . An appropriate , historical argument may be brought for or against the teachings of Christ , as these have evinced a power for good or evil in the world . The history df civilization has to do , and that most intimately , with religious faith ; a just estimate of the part it has taken becomes a cardinal point . Buckle has not gone beyond his topic in discussing religions tendencies , but treated that topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an equal complexity of causes , we must know something of the nature of those various causes , or we shall be unable , in discriminating the effect , to refer each several tendency to its appropriate force . The religious hierarchy has at times exerted very diverse influences , and been found in conflict with itself . Which , among these tendencies , has been the Christian tendency , and which , the foreign alloying element of human passion ? On the correct answer of these inquiries must depend the justness of our philosophy . To attribute , in blind or malignant prejudice , to one of these causes , what properly belongs to the other , is to substitute // deceitful advocacy for candid inquiry , and to forfeit the character of a philosopher . It is not claimed that Christianity has anywhere completed its work . It has everywhere existed in a state of conflict and struggle , sometimes more , sometimes less , successful . Our task is , therefore , to discover tendencies , and stndy the character of incipient efforts , and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of seizing upon partial or perverted manifestations , jndging through these the character of a force but slightly efficient in them . Christianity will ever be more or less involved in all the wrong tendencies of the time , since it is in the world , and finds lodgment in the hearts of men ; the only question is , whether it is there to aid or resist these tendencies ? The formalism seen in the IRoinish Chnrch , the bigotry found in many churches , are not new elements . They belonged to human nature long before Christianity made its appearance , and can not , because they have successfully resisted this new tendency , and gained a partial victory over it , be rightly referred to it . Does the Gospel of Christ tend to bigotm* and formalism ? Both from its inherent nature and from history , we answer , No . Why , No , from history ? Because to both of these tendencies , even when gaining ground in the church , there has been within that very church a determined opposition , based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new in the world , and finds its only explanation in the liberal love of the gospel . So , too , when reform has come , it has come from within the church , and not from without . The great reforms , liberalizing thought and setting up the right of private judgment , have arisen and been pushed to completion by men profoundly influenced*by gospel truth . Steady , protracted , and successful resmstance has been found in religious movements , siichas those organized under Luther and Calvin , and as those expressed in the words , Protestant , Puritan , Methodist . We care not if some of these movements have stopped short , and relapsed into bigotry . This has only given occasion for a new dissent , till , through a series of dissents followii*g each other on religious grounds , the freedom of conscience , of worship , and largely of civil liberty , has been achieved . There has ever // been a growing bud , and each sheath , that has in succession become a dead integument striving to bind it , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new in the world , a system that ever reforms itself ; that comes forth with renewed vigor from each internal conflict ; that rejects the doings of its own agents , and takes to itself new retainers ; that rebukes the wrongs done in its name , and allies itself afresh to knowledge and civilization . Each successive hierarchy that has deserted the Gospel has been in turn deserted by the Gospel , and the attack which has proved its final overthrow has been urged by religion . This is the precise power and peculiarity of Christianity , that it usually leads , and always allies itself to , every truly liberal movement , and is first to reject those who deny its spirit . Through that which is partial and imperfect , it moves to that which is complete and perfect . It is useless to deny , and we shall not urge the point , that the new broke away from the old first in religion , that here knowledge and liberty achieved their earliest victories , and that following this dawn of religious truth came the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be marked . In England the religious movement has ever preceded and sustained all other progress . In France the scientific impulse was chiefly received , and was , in a large measure , divorced from the religious impulse which gave rise to it . The difference in results is allied to this difference in causes . The destructive process has been more marked in France than in England . Her revolution proved chiefly valuable for what it swept away . The constructive process , on the other hand , has been much more complete in England than in France . The one has slowly forced out the old with the new ; the other has swept away the old , and yet been compelled , through ungoverned forces , through anarchy , in part to return to it . The difference between the two countries lies chiefly in the religious element ; and through the want of this , the one failed to retain what she had fairly won . If what has been said of the influence of Christianity in securing progress is just , it should follow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no previous time has Christianity // possessed more strength than now , and this we think to be true . If strength lies chiefly in organized , external influence , in civil power , it is evidently not true . But if true power is internal , and consists in the hold upon the hearts and actions of men , then it is true . There has never been a time in which more intelligence has rallied to the defense of Christianity , or been called forth in the study of its Scriptures , and explanation of their doctrines . There is no comparison between the power which now belongs to the pious and intelligent clergy , and that which the priest and monk of old possessed . The former have all the influence which any class of men can have in a free community , the influence which belongs to character , to knowledge , and religions truth , systematically and constantly presented . This power may not excite the attention which belongs to political station ; but in real inherent force , it greatly exceeds it . IReligions instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , is the only instruction that begins and ends with life , that returns weekly to the people amid all perplexities , theoretical and practical . Certainly , no more commanding attitude could be wished for Christianity than this . She has not been forced to this attitude , *she has chosen it . No wise man , as a question of power , would barter this position with and of the people for any hierarchical rule over them . It is certainly a great mistake to think a loss of the showy symbols of power the loss of power . What Buckle regards as the forced degradation of the clergy is rather their chosen elevation . They give themselves to the creation of power , rather than to those slight modifications of it which belong to government . Herein is seen the nature of Christianity ; according as the age becomes thoughtful and spiritual , it seats itself in the domain of thought and spirit , and rules there . It becomes the instructor of men . Engaged in so great a work , it can not come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor . It is religion alone that bears the flag of civilization over the earth . The affirmation is most untrue , that civilization is the antecedent and Christianity the consequent . What sends the missionary ? Christianity : // mere knowledge has no missionaries . And what , with the barbarian , is the entering and efficacious force ? Those , who alone have a right to testify , answer : The moral power of Christianity . If this be true , the disseminating power of civilization belongs to it through Christianity . Not less is progress , in any given community , chiefly due to this same agent . Take the issues of the day ; are they not chiefly moral ? Liberty , the right relation between subject and subject , and between these and the ruler , must rest on equality , and this can only be found in our moral constitution , and the independent service due to ourselves and to God . If we are not made to glorify and enjoy Him , we may be made to glorify , and be enjoyed by , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on moral grounds . Self-interest alone will not prevent a conflict between nations . Plunder was never thought to result in the advantage of all parties . But that does not hinder the stronger from finding his immediate gain in it . Prudence presents too weak and remote a mQtive to check the love of conquest , and must have the support *of morality . In the past , a false glory , made possible by the immorality of the times , has been more than sufficient to prevail over prudence . Above all , within society itself the submission of class to class , the slavery of class under class , has only been , and can only be , successfully resisted on the grounds of Christianity . Without such resistance , all civilization must miscarry . The restless element beneath will force its way up , and , through the open fissure , pour forth its lava stream . This juncture , when the Bible is invoked to sanction one of the worst forms of this evil , may seem an unfortunate moment to urge , in this regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is what has been seen from the beginning ; the spirit and the letter are in conflict ; and this , like other struggles , will be settled by the inherent force of religious truth . The cerements of the grave will be loosened at the word of Christ , and a new man , nay , a new race , be let go in the world . If the moral impulse belongs to the constitution of man , it is evidently there as a supreme law . This it claims to be , and , // this claim denied , its authority is utterly overthrown . If we heed , therefore , the voice of our own constitution , we shall be prepared to expect the highest individual development only in connection with the moral elemeut , only in connection with the religious element which is its fullness and life . Experience certainly confirms this expectation , and the world is chiefly indebted to that talent which has been subject to moral law . Simple , scientific and mechanical problems may , indeed , be solved aside from morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their influence , have begun to work in and on society , the moral relations of their actions have risen into chief importance , and these have furnished the just balance in which character has been weighed . iBut if the highest individual good involves religion , will not the highest social good also include it ? What are we to think of a civilization , or expect from it , which does not make the best estate of the individual , one of its premises ? All the nnagn aninnity and greatness of character which religion has developed become a most significant fact in seeking for the conditions of a high social state . The great men in philanthropic effort , and they alone , reveal the force which is to make society philanthropic , that is , truly social . There are one or two lessons which religious men , and especially the clergy , may well gather from the treatment which religious questions receive at the present time . The period of successful bigotry has completely passed . iReligion is , and must be , amenable to reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to instructed , liberal thought . The very effort to expel reason from this province , if of any avail , is itself an appeal to reason . This assertion by no means implies an ability , on our part , to explain all that revelation may offer , but only that its subject matter , its authority , its effects , are , in all their branches , of right open to reason ; and that its deepest mysteries , like those of nature , are pointed out , and girt about , by knowledge . Revelation is as rational in what it withholds as in what it gives , iii the inexplicable remainder of truths as in its primary principles . It is a sad thing for men to reason against divine truth , ignorantly , unfairly , or malignantly , but a bigoted adherence to irrational // 192 Buckle 's History of Civilization . dogma is neither a defense or a remedy . Blind bigoty and defiant skepticism are the natural complements of each other , and the first must provoke the last . There are many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair discussion of truth . It is through this skepticism that the noblest victories of religion are often achieved . Religious philosophy-for philosophy is most direct in its religious bearings-was greatly renovated by the skepticism of Hume . A new attack is a new opportunity , and , with a quickened intellect , before a quickened audience , we are called to the promulgation and defense of the truth . Science has done much for religion in forcing it from an illiberal , dogmatic interpretation , and in giving breadth and volume to thought . Fortunate is it for us , if we can suffer our creeds to be shattered , and preserve our faith entire . Every anathema , every cry of heresy , assumes the weakness of the truth , and implies that we are now about to retire from fair inquiry and cogent presentation . If , defeated in the plain , we hide in the fortress , this will not long defend us . When reason has failed , authority takes up its weapons to little purpose . Religion is rational , and has nothing to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rational , her victories would be sooner won . We know in part : the assumption , therefore , that we have treasured in our creeds the whole of doctrine is most immediately destructive to our* own progress , and very fatal to the religious spirit , when an inquisitive and unscrupulous science presses in upon us on every side . The second and more recent volume of Mr. Buckle 's History , though possessed of much interest , is less valuable than the first , and more open in its attack on religion . In this , as in the earlier part of the work , the clergy still suffer the chief onset , now directed against the Spanish priesthood and Scotch ministry . The marginal references , by which the text is supported in its most bitter and unjust assault on the latter body , when fairly interpreted , fail to render the needed proof . Buckle here shows himself wholly unable to understand the religious spirit . All the misrepresentations , misapprehensions , and gross caricatures with which Calvinistic doctrine has again and again been met , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion as hitherto . So much has this feeling gained ground in the present volume that it often departs from its appropriate theme , shaping its argument for the ever-returning attack on religion and those who minister in its name . All that man regards most sacred , is to the author deadly and gross superstition . Religion , under whatever name it may appear , Protestant or Catholic , Episcopal or Presbyterian , is ever the same , calling for the contempt of philosophy , and the indignant rejection of intelligent men . The second volume renders at least one service ; the battery is completely unmasked , and we see that our new enemy is but one of the old army of infidelity. *The attack is made on the side of natural law , and the claims of a science that recognizes no Providence in nature are everywhere sternly insisted on . If these are granted , if we recognize nothing but " universal , eternal , unchangeable law in the world of external facts and forces , it will not be easy to withstand similar affirmations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character imud government of God will be lost . This is the conflict between reason and faith , science and religion .
