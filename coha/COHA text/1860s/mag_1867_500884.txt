THE magnificent physical beauty of the English women of the higher and middle classes is proverbial , and its cause is almost as indisputable as the fact of its being . It is the natural outgrowth and sequence of their free , generous out-of-door life . They are of the turf ; turfy-devoted to their heathery hills and downs , their wide expanse of " sea-marge and moor , " their noble forests and fields . Hawking , equestrianism , archery and croquet have each had their share in the development of that ruddy beauty for which England 's women are famous . Her country homes are the admiration of all travellers , the glory and pride of all Englishmen . Centuries of art , wealth and taste have added externally and internally to their adornment . The town life of the English is a short one : it is a brief season of dissipation , a whirl and flutter among the salons , a dash umong the operas and dramas , and then away to " fields and pastures new , " ever fresh and beautiful in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real life is not of the town , but of . the country . Here we have reversed this order of things : we live in the town five-sixths of the year , and under solemn protest consent , for the children 's benefit , to stay in the country the remaining two months . This is sorrily done in us , flouting nature by giving her unwilling service ; yet , measurably , we are reforming it , not so much out of love for green fields and babbling brooks as out of fear of the tax and rent-gatherers . Whatever has in it the tendency to help us to a keener enjoyment of the country , to attract us nearer to nature , and to render her charms more alluring to tired eyes , brain and heart , should win a cordial welcome from town-loving America . Croquet is one of these helps ; and , from the moment of its introduction here , our pale-faced , dyspeptic-looking men and women eagerly welcomed it . From the beginning of that first game at Staten Island , its success was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caring nothing for its physical benefits , keenly as the palefaced girt to whom it brought bloom of cheek and light of eye , acknowledged its fascination , became eloquent in its praises , learned in its mysteries . The very fact that it was a game in which the two sexes could join , won for it admirers and devotees in multitudes . It lacked the intoxication and likewisc the nastiness of the German cotillon , but it afforded even larger opportunities for pure , true lovers to chase the shining hours away . The positions of the players were so graceful , the interest of , the game was so exhilarabing , and the waiting between turns of play gave Philemon and Phillis the chance // to interchange sweet nothings . It was a game of hearts they played out there in the sweet Summer evening , as well as croquet , so that all young people , who all are lovers , loved croquet , until the frequent echo of its balls along the Hudson hills might have given the dwellers in the valley below the weird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every twilight in ghostly tenpins above them . As we suggested , we are as a people developing a taste for country out-door life and sports ; but we have much yet to learn , and we can go for our education . to no better school than that of our English cousins . Centuries of pupilage in the field , forest and stable , have given them a wide , generous culture , which we lack . They had wealth to encourage their taste , and the home of art was not thousands of miles , but simply a few hours ' journey , away . It was only the other day that our grandmothers laid aside their spinningwheels and samplers of Berlin wool . What culture was there then for their daughters ? what chance for growth of mind or heart or limb ? In these later days of steam , petroleum , contracts , wealth has descended upon us , art pours her treasures into our laps , and , as a result , the banks of our rivers and bays , our hill-sides and lowlying valleys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and beautiful as Titbottom 's castle in Spain , some frightfully made up as the phantasmagoria of a contractor 's dream . But they each and all presage and suggest a new and broader life , a more bountiful culture , a more intimate knowledge of nature , from whose 1 lenteous fountain* flow all virtue , refinement and health . Let us hope that , connected with each one of them , there is a broad , smooth expanse of lawn , gracefully set apart for , and devoted to , croquet . If there is not one , there should be . It is the only out-of-door pastime that has thus far succeeded in the affections of our countrywomen . They are its disciples , and from them it claims great homage . It is admirably suited to the softer feelings of a refined life : it is quiet , orderly ; teaching patience , perseverance ; requiring a gentle , unruffled temper , a generous regard for others ' rights . Indeed , amiability and unselfishness are the first requisites for a good player , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whoever has these wiH succeed at the game , and in its inspiriting exercise and the buoyant stir that it gives to the blood , will they find their great reward . Croquet is essentially a social game , provocative of good hui*or , wit and fellowship ; one in which old men forget their gout , young ones their bills unpaid ; in which old ladies trip gayly across the sod in their chase of an " enemy " more lightly than in the long-ago they trod the floor to the undulating measure of the minuet ; in which the young ones blend duty and enjoyni*ent so evenly that health blooms on their cheeks , lustre in their eyes , and renewed life throbs // iL every elastic step . It is a game in which old and young , men and women , meeting on common ground , knock old Time on the head through merry hours , blithely as they batter the balls around , and while the strongest of them would shrink appalled from the thought of a mile-long walk in the hot August gloaming , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , they accomplish a journey of from two to three miles an hour for hours together , in blissful ignorance of the task performed . But did they care to go from effect to cause , they would find in croquet the occasion of increased appetite , the long , restful sleep , the buoyant step . It was but five or six years ago that the game was introduced into En * land , by whom or whence no one has preserved the record . There , though , its popularity is *reatest ; how great may be inferred from the fact that , on the cover of a little hand-book of the game , published in London by Mr. Edmund Routledge , that gentleman informs us that we have before us one of the twenty-sixth thousand copies he had already sold in 1 866 . We kope that Mr. Edmund Routledge knows more about truth than he does of croquet , for if he does not , his statement regarding those twenty-sii thousand should be cautiously received . But even this gentleman does not pretend to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble grace for which her sons are celebrated , bows to England , thanking her for the invention of the sport ; while England , with cumbersome politeness , but with too much honesty to claim the brood which she has not hatched , is grateful to France for giving the bantling a name . But did France stand its sponsor ? As evidence that she did , the authorities , who are numerous as the birds of the air , assert among them that the name is derived from the French word crc quer , which means to crunch between the teeth , and which sound is similar , they say , to the cracking of the balls together . But another says that Paris supplies the exact word in croquet , which is a name given to a peculiar sort of gingerbread made in that city , and to eat which , so hard and brittle is it , the teeth snap and crack precisely like the contact of two wooden balls ; and yet others urge , with some little plausibility , that the expression croquer le marmot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game ; for , say they , is it not a constant dance after the balls and waiting upon one another ? But another dyspeptic , bilious Englishman suggests that the name is only a corruption of the word coquette , thereby meaning that ladies employ in the pursuit of the game coquettish devices , such as luring an enemy to them by ravishing smiles , graceful attitudes , and generous display of dainty feet . All this is malice , and we dismiss it with such contempt as it deserves . The last contestant for time honor of the name is a jolly , red-faced John Bull , who will not admit that any good thing was ever named or existed out of England . He says , as he // tosses a ball from hand to hand , that croquet is simply an affected , mincing manner of pronouncing cricket . Among such a host of authorities , we can not attempt to decide . The principle of croquet is of the simplest , yet if one goes to the books for it , nothing can result to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put their oracular utterances upon paper , and printed them , may be counted by the score , yet they all differ regarding the proper manner of playing the game . The only thing in which they all entirely agree is that croquet , in the primary principle , consists in the players , eight in number , being supplied with wooden mallets and balls , which latter they shall , in their respective turns , drive through a number of iron bridges or hoops firmly set into the ground in a certain irregular order . Who first succeeds in doing this is the winner of the game . But without modifications and obstacles to overcome from starting post and return , there would be no field for authorities , and the matter of play would be so simple as to divest it of all interest to the players . The obstacles which are to be surmounted and which entirely preclude a quiet and uninterrupted running of the hoops are , first , their irregular order ; second , manifold encounters with enemies lying in the path , who , fiercely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirling off the field , and third , the necessity of striking the slender stakes placed at either end of the ground . In croquet the first . consideration is an appropriate ground upon which to play . It need not necessarily be large , yet the larger the better , as space assures freedom of action . But a very interesting game may be played upon a plot not more than twenty feet wide by forty long ; nor , while it is desirable , is it essential , that the ground should be level and regular . Indeed , very pretty play may be had upon ground where every ball in its passage from bridge to . bridge describes a curve . But let no tyro in the science of the game try his hand on such a field ; it will prove to b* his Waterloo . To skilful players it affords rare and desirable oliortumties for delicate strokes , and to those of the saturninely-muscular sort it gives a glorious chance for punishing enemies by sending their balls to the bottom of a hill . Where circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently mowed , rolled and watered ; all parasites of the sod should be carefully removed and nothing but the clean lawn grass allowed to grow . On such a ground the pleasures of croquet are enhanced a huiidred fold to both the skilled and unskilled player ; the latter has some chance of making a beautiful stroke , or of punishing an enemy , while the former can , with certain aim , coolness , and a steady blow , drive a ball wheresoever he would have it go . As to the most desirable form for setting the bridges , and the number to be used , it will be readily seen that to the proficient // player the number and the combination of hoops which present the most obstacles to running them are the best and most apposite . But the comruonest intelligence given twelve hoops to work with , will suggest many forms in which all the difficulties and fascinations of the game will be presented . After the ground , the implements of the game are to be chosen , and to the selection of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peculiarities of the ground must decide the character and size of the balls and mallets . If the ground selected is on a smooth , level lawn which is often mowed , the balls should be made of maple , measuring about ten inches and weighing not more than six ounces . But if an unrolled , unclipt field is used , where the inequalities of surface , rank grass and the like destroy the smoothness , the balls should measure not less than twelve inches in circumference , and be made of some heavier wood than maple , for the heavier and larger the ball , the more certain will be its course over uneven ground . Lignumvit* is now used for the highest-priced sets by the manufacturers , principally , we think , on account of the brilliant polish this wood takes , but it is not only too heavy , it is too brittle and liable to fracture . The best wood for a heavy ball is apple , where it can be secured well seasoned : for light mallets , ash should be used , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoyances occurring in the game , and which gives rise to a large number of disputes among players , is technically known as " Play out of Turn . " Upon almost every croquet ground there will be found those individuals who are by nature mysteriously gifted with stupidity in a larger and more provoking degree than any of the human species ever found off of it . They are the nightmares of croquet , visiting with splenetic horrors skilful , careful players , often rendering their superbest strokes of no avail . To get rid of them entirely is impossible , yet we think we can suggest a very simple device to mitigate the evils of their blundering forgetfulness . We long ago concluded that time and expense were both wasted in painting the rings around the top of the posts and in giving similar colors to the balls . For the purpose of preventing misplay they are in any case utterly useless ; for in the middle of an exciting game of croquet , in the centre of the field , players can not be constantly running to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor can the mysteriously endowed , above referred to , ascertain his color at all from the rings . Instead of them and the corresponding hues on the balls , we suggest that numbers from 1 to 8 , both inclusive , be painted in large , clear figures , with brilliant tints , on the balls . This very simple arrangement would at once remove all possibility of play out of turn , and thereby add to the already great fascination of the game . // The mallets are made too long in the handle and too light in the body . The handle should never exceed in length two feet four inches , and in all cases its weight should be largely in excess of that of the ball . Where they are made much lighter , as is frequently the case , even in the most expensive sets found in the stores , they are entirely nnreliable and almost worthless . In croquet , as in mechanics , the object to be driven should be lighter than the object driving . The heads of the mallets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convex . The posts and the bridges should always be painted white . Frequently when the game draws near to its close , and while half a dozen enthusiasts hang expectant on the result of the next few strokes of the mallet , the twilight suddenly deepens , and the hoops being of some dark hue , closely assimilating with the color of the ground , their precise location is rendered uncertain , the game , which is one of those that is never lost until it is won , has to be abandoned , greatly to the chagrin and discomfort of the players , each one of whom was sanguine of his own success in its issue . If ; however , they are painted white , they can easily be distinguished from the green of the turf until the sun has quite gone . Indeed , one of the pleasantest games we ever played was on a model ground , smooth as a mirror and level as a floor , set with dazzling white bridges , long after the sun had gone down , and where the only light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another stronger objection to dark-colored bridges is the danger that lurks in them for nearsighted people crossing the ground , and for any person who is on it ' after sundown . Many and serious accidents have occurred from tripping over them , which would have been avoided had the ro er color been adopted in their embellishment . A croquet set , made of the best materials , of well seasoned wood , may be procured from a turner in wood , in any of- our cities or villages , for from three to five dollars , complete , with the exception of the hoops . These may be obtained at any hardware stoma by purchasing one-quarter-inch iron wire , costing but a few cents . One yard , bent around a tree to give it proper shape , is all that is required for one hoop . The ends should be filed down to a point to enable their being the more easily placed in the ground , though this is not essential . The implements entire , if obtained in this way , will in no case be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchased from the stores . We have , on our own ground , a set made for us by a wood turner two years ago , and it has probably seen as much service , and received as hard knocks , as any set in the country , yet , with the exception of a single mallet cracked , it is in perfect condition . The balls are without a flaw , the mallets fair faced , and the whole looking as if it might last out our life time . The entire cost of this set was five dollars . In the same // period , a friend , upon whose ground we occasion ally play , has purchased three sets at a total cost of forty-five dollars . iLet us consider now the mooted points of the game . The chief of these is , " Shall any but a Rover be permitted to use the loosecroquet ? " On this point the authorities are about equally divided in their decisions . The English writers are almost unanimous in confining this stroke to the Rover , while the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the fields where we have played , either the players had studied only the American writers , or the temptations offered by loose-croquet were so great and overpowering that they nearly all united in giving its advantages to every one upon the ground after he had passed the booby stage of the game . We have tried both principles and given it careful attention through many well contested matches , and we are compelled to the conclusion that it is advisable that the Rover alone should be entitled to the advantages afforded by this play . If it is not confined to him exclusively , he is thereby shorn of half his power , and of the reward of his skill in being the first to run the bridges ; and with the loss of these , the great temptation to rove is lost . A player who has this privilege granted him before running all the hoops , may , by the use of loose-croquet , prolong the game to a most tedious length . It only becomes necessary for him to pass the first bridge , then to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put himself in position for the next hoop , run that , and again croquet each friend and adversary in turn , only taking care to use the last one as a porter to carry him to the mouth of his next bridge . This he may continue to do indefinitely if he is a superior player ; and in the meantime all the others are standing by idle and disgusted with the selfishness of a single player . If stupidity or selfishness be encouraged by the rules of croquet to thus take possession of the field to the exclusion of the rest , the game is robbed of its great charm , which is the constant excitement each player feels in the frequent recurrence of his turn . On any field there is not often more than one player possessing the rudeness and skill necessary to follow up such a proceeding , but if it were to be adopted by some six or eight participants in a match , they would probably all be gray before the issue could be determined . Several of the highest of the English authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , decide that the Booby is to be played from the spot to which it has been struck , and that it must not be taken up and played from its origi ial position , which is , say some , a mallet 's length from the starting post , and twelve inches , say others . This rule is so evidently pernicious that we can not account for its adoption among intelligent players , yet on many fields it is a rule made absolute . A Booby *ias achieved nothing : it can not croquet , it can not be croqued . It is only better // than the dead ball inasmuch as it has not started . Until it has passed the first bridge it has no rights of defence or offence . Yet this rule gives it the vitality of disadvantage , and none of advantage . As a rule it works ill in many ways , but it is especially unfair to beginners . They , not knowing from experience how slight a blow is necessary to drive the ball to the first hoop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through , invariably strike the ball hard and carelessly , and drive it not only outside of the bridge but far beyond it , to one or the other side , at an oblique angle . If these tyros are compelled to play the ball from its resting place back to within one or two feet of the starting post , they are thrown so far behind the more experienced players that there is not the remotest possibility of their success in the game . Croquet is meant to be in itself so fair , friendly , and harmonizing that whatever rules are introduced into it should be made to coincide with its intention . But the most objectionable feature of thisrule is that it permits a skilful player player who has been so unfortunate as to win the unpleasant honor of beginning the game , to play his ball in such a manner a1s to drive it close to the mouth of the bridge , in which position it can not be croqued by reason of its boobyhood ; in his next turn , which he has made by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before them , he is enabled to drive it through the bridge and with it croquet all the others who had won the toss for lateP play . It may be suggested that this would be unfair and dishonorable . But who is to decide whether the ball was knocked to the mouth of the bridge by accident or design ? And again , in croquet , as in trade and war and love , are there not those who think all tactics are fair ? Our objection is that a rule should be made which encourages unfairness . A vile infringement of the rules is what is called the " push shot . " There is but one single authority on the game who sanctions it , yet we believe it is the most universally infringed rule of them all . No ladies , we believe , regard it , and gentlemen , good players , too , oftentinies ignore it . By the use of the push shot , a ball may be in a hundred instances impelled against an adversary , when a fair blow would never so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obstacle , or the roughness of the ground . Another innocent trick the ladies successfully use upon the field is to employ their trailing hoops in placing the ball in a more favorable position . These simple-minded ones , in whom there is no guile , stand over their ball , then , advancing their sumptuous skirts , draw the ball to the spot desired . Ladies , be honorable , and reform this trick altogether , for in most cases you do not need these little helps : you are generally better players than the men ; you play more frequently than they do ; besides , your nerves are steadier , and croquet is more the business of life with you than with them . Even in that supreme mo // ment of your triumph , when young Spooneye 's ball is l ) eneath the Arab arch of your foot , and you draw above it the shining drapery , till delicate foot and dainty ankle glimmer before his eyes , his introverted gaze is turned toward some unbalanced ledger eo lumn or over-drawn bank aecount . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been wasted on him ; for , as in a dream he has seen the white wings of angels , he has seen dimly the sudden glory of your understanding , and he will remember it , too , longer than nightmare of ledger or bank , longer even than his dream of the angels . But even young Spooneyc has to think of the shop in the most exciting game , while you , innocent of the tortuous ways of trade , can give your whole sweet soul up to its fascinations . Surely these are advantages enough ; why , then , take any unfair ones ? Croquet is a game capable of displaying in the greatest degree the gracefulness of the human figure . But how often are these opportunities lost by the awkwardness of the players in their manner of striking the balls . Either they take the mallet in both hands , as if to emulate the quarrymen wielding their sledge hammers at SingSing , or they bend double above the balls , their noses pimost in contact with the ground . These practices are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . A successful stroke with the mallet held in both hands is no more possible than a successful defence of tHe wickets would be in cricket with the bat in one hand . In croquet , the right hand alone should hold the mallet , the handle being lightly and firmly held in the palm , with the dexter finger held dosely along it to direct the stroke . Only in this way can the player have entire control of the implement , or feel secure to achieve success . His position when in the act of striking should be nearly erect ; he should not stand over the ball , but by the side of it , and the arm should have the precise swing of a pendulum . There is , we believe , in none of the books a rule against a player directing a partner how to play his ball ; yet there should be such a rule , for frequently , in every game , a player is called upon by a partner to " give a sight " upon the ball he desires to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or places his mallet-handle on a line with it , and the stroke is successfully made . This is precisely the same thing as telling a friend what card to play after you have seen his opponent 's hand , or , as you lean over *s chair , make a happy move for him in draughts when you have dptected a damaging combination , which he has not . Each player should make his own play , undirected by another . We feel obliged to differ from the weightiest of the authorities as to whether a ball that has been struck through a hoop , and which , from the unevenness of the ground , has rolled back again , haspassed the bridge . They decide that the ball has not passed . Why 27 // 0 has it not ? They admit it was knocked through by a fair blow . how can it be through and not pass the bridge ? It was struck through by the player 's skill . That it rolled back again was no fault of his , but of the ground . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do , can not avoid , and why for that which he can not avoid should he be made the loser ? An especial annoyance to which all players are subject , is the constant impertinent interference of mere lookers-on of the game . These pqsts , often the best-intentioned people in the world , stand about , often , indeed , upon the ground , advising now one player and then another as to the manner of his play . It is not only intrusive and impolite , for inasmuch as it distracts the player 's attention and interferes with certainty of aim , it . is unfair . The question is often asked what number of players should engage in a game ? Four persons make the best complement , and if there are two ladies , a gentleman and lady playing as partners , so much the better . Six players , three on a side , are not too many for an agreeable game , but we give the preference to the smaller number . Eight is the number generally recommended by the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on account of its prolonging the game to a dreary length , but because it sets the periods between the turns of the players too far apart . At the sea-side or at any Summer resort , where there are many contestants for the mallets and balls , if two full sets arc provided , sixteen persons in parties of four can play the most fascinating game possible in croquet . As we write these last lines we look from our library window upon a broad lawn , dotted with the implements of the game . Some gayly dressed children idly knock the balls about while our guests , the adepts and devotees of croquet , dress for dinner . Their light buoyant steps echo along the halls and on the stairs . Their voices , fluag down from stairway and gallery , are full of merry quips , of laughter , of a keen enjoyment of life . Above our old house by the sea some apple trees wave their branches and fret themselves ; their ripening fruits tell of advancing Summer , the season dear to youth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most out of doors , where the birds sing , the waters flow , the trees blossom , and nature comes closest to man , tenderly lifting him nearer to the Giver of all bounties . Let Its be grateful for the pleasant Summer and all it brings us , and if croquet helps us to a better appreciation of nature by seducing us to breathe its pure , blossom-laden air , let us have unlimited croquet .
