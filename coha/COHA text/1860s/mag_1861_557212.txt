By HENRY THOMAS BUCKLE . Volume II . From the Second London Edition . To which is added an Alphabetical Index . New York : ID . Appleton &amp; Co. 1861. 8vo. pp. 476 . MR . BUCKLE belongs to a peculiar class of English thinkers , - the Philosophical Radicals as they have been called , - some of whom have become distinguished in every generation for the last two centuries . Their great leader and prototype , who may be regarded as the founder of the school and the most original genius that has adorned it , was the philosopher of Malmesbury , Thomas Hobbes . His successors have adopted most of his opinions , because they inherited from him the peculiar traits *f character in which those opinions had their origin . Obstinate , dogmatic , hard-headed , and impassive , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win affection or sympathy ; and it is perhaps a stronger reproach that they have never felt the want of either . The nature of their speculations has been determined by peculiarities of temperament and disposition more than by qualities of intellect . Cold in feeling , and averse to every manifestation of enthusiasm , they have uniformly adopted low and degrading views of human nature , and prided themselves on running counter to the opinions and shocking some of the dearest sentiments of their fellow-men . We lose the best safeguards of sound judgment when the errors of the head are no longer checked by the warm impulses of the heart . In theorizing upon human conduct , some of the most important data are left out of the account if men are regarded only as thinking machines , as uniformly selfish in their aims , and as guided only by a blind destiny to the accomplishment of results which they had never contemplated . The pride of individual iiitellect is not at all averse to such humiliating estimates of human nature in general . He who is fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes an unconscious exception of his own case , and prides himself on the perspicacity which detects the causes of self-delusion in others . Mackintosh , speaking of Hobbes , remarks , that " it might seem incredible , if it were not established by the experience of all ages , that those who differ most from the opinions of their fellow-men are most confident of the truth of their own . It commonly requires an overweening conceit of the superiority of a man 's own judgment , to make him espouse very singular notions ; and when he has once embraced them , they are endeared to him by the hostility of those whom he contemns as the prejudiced vulgar . " We do not undervalue the abilities of the leaders of this school , or deny that they have analyzed successfully some of the complex phenomena of mind , and made many important contributions to the philosophy of history and society . ilobbes himself is a striking example of a great intellect warped , but not dwarfed , by a perverse temper . Even Mr. Buckle has much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vast field of inquiry , unites the contribution of many sciences , and establishes a deceptive appearance of unity and method where we had looked only for incongruity and confusion . But his learning is multifarious and extensive , rather than exact or profound ; he passes with great leaps over the difficult portions of his subject , and discards or mutilates the facts which do not suit his purpose , or will not fit into his theory . Arrogance is fed by imperfect knowledge ; and one who is a smatterer in many sciences , without a perfect knowledge of any , often settles magisterially questions which still perplex and confound modest and competent inquirers . Mr. Buckle is not a great scholar , like Mr. Grote , nor has he the varied attainments and the genius for bold but judicious speculation which distinguish Mr. Mill . The very title of his work indicates rather overweening confidence in his own powers , than a clear understanding of the nature of his subject , or a definite purpose as to the end to be attained . The self-styled historian of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , or wherein a history of it differs from any other branch of historical // disquisition . With this imperfect conception of the nature of his undertaking , it is not surprising that he has already filled two thick volumes before reaching the threshold of his proper subject , and has even been driven to a frank confession that his original plan was too extensive , and that its execution consequently is impossible . In truth , the title of the work , as far as it has proceeded , is a misnomer . It is not a history of civilization or of anything else , but the statement of a system of doctrine , borrowed in great part from the Positive Philosophy of Comte , and supported by a series of illustrations drawn at random from the history of all nations and all ages , and from the records of literature and science . Hence the work is eminently discursive and ill-digested , and might be prosecuted through a dozen more thick volumes , filled with the fruits of the author 's various reading , but having no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China , and affording not even a glimpse of the writer 's theory respecting the nature of civilization . In point of mere style , the merits of the book are considerable , and even the rambling and desultory nature of its contents is a source of attractiveness and power . The language is clear , animated , and forcible , sometimes rising very nearly to eloquence , and marked with the earnestness of one who thoroughly believes the doctrine which he expounds . Even the cool dogmatism of Mr. Buckle 's assertions , and his entire confidence in the truth of his opinions and the force of his arguments , are often as amusing as they are unreasonable . One who has no doubts to express , and no qualifications or exceptions to state , has a great advantage in point of liveliness of manner . Like his great master , Hobbes , he betrays a good deal of egotism also , a quality which adds much to the freshness and raciness of his style . We have already intimated that there is no novelty in Mr. Buckle 's doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending them . He is simply a necessitarian and a sceptic ; and he shows all the earnestness of a fanatic in preaching the gospel of fatalism and unbelief . In his view , man is a plant that grqws and thinks , the form and place of his growth , and the products of his thought , being as little 44* // dependent on his will or effort , as the bark , leaves , and fruit of a tree are on its own choice . All alike are subject to the " skyey influences . " Food , soil , climate , - these make up the man , and determine what he must be . They make up the whole man , - not merely his animal frame , but his life and soul , if he has any . If these are rich and generous , so will be the man , and his thoughts and actions . His moral nature is nothing ; it has no lasting effect upon his character or conduct . And his spiritual nature is a mere fiction . The laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , and shape our nature and destiny . And these laws are as permanent and uncontrollable as the laws of gravitation and chemical affinity . If we knew them perfectly , we could tell what the past must have been , and what the future will inevitably be ; we could " look into the seeds of time , and see which grain would grow , and which would not . " And we can learn them ; from the statistics of what has been , we can prophesy what will be . As with individuals , so with communities and nations . These are but aggregates of individuals , and their history , also , is shaped by irreversible laws ; and the system of averages , which eliminates small disturbing forces and abnormal instances , enables us to predict the result with greater ease and certainty in the case of these aggregates than in that of individuals . The history of human beings , the history of civilization , is like that of the solar and starry systems . When a Kepler , a Newton , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tabulated results to order , we shall see that all is subject to law ; and knowing the law , we shall know all . Evidently this is a sketch of a system of philosophy , and not a project of writing history . At the very beginning , Mr. Buckle has a theory to set forth , and a doctrine to establish ; and he ransacks all history , literatm7e , and science for proofs and illustrations of his preconceived opinion . Herein he violates the first principles of his own method ; for he is a fanatical adherent of the Baconian system , and attributes most of the errors that have been committed in philosophy and science to the use of the deductive method , whereby reasoners assumed the maxims which they ought to have proved , and // proceeded from generals to particulars , not allowing " either themselves or others to sift the general propositions which were to cover and control the particular facts . " Even Adam Smith 's great work , the Wealth of Nations , which appears to most observers a very noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast collection of facts , seems faulty to Mr. Buckle , as consisting too much of maxims previously assumed and evidence subsequently discovered , a great body of derivative principles being worked out in it by pure reasoning . Mr. flume , also , both as a metaphysician and a historian , is gravely censured for proceeding in the inverse order from laws to facts , and reasoning deductively from preconceived doctrines . To the error thus committed by these two great philosophers , an error in which they were followed by all their Scotch contemporaries , Mr. Buckle attributes the narrow and enslaved condition of the human mind in Scotland , where , for three centuries , it has remained a prey to superstition and religious persecution , the bigotry and blind asceticism of the Kirk stifling all freedom of thought and action , and compelling the people to attribute events to supernatural causes , instead of tracing them to the immutable action of physical laws . Superstition and spiritual tyranny rest upon arbitrary assumptions and the deductive method ; while physical science in general , and especially the science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection of facts , and the application of the principles of the inductive philosophy . Mr. Buckle professes to act upon these principles with the utmost rigor and precision ; and he begins with an elaborate statement of the truths which his whole subsequent history is to prove . The first of these assumptions upon which the whole philosophy of history is here made to rest , is the doctrine of Fatalism , or the necessity which governs all human actions , so that , when all the circumstances are known , the result can be told beforehand with as much certainty as we now predict the occurrence of an eclipse . We call this doctrine an assumption ; for it is made in opposition to the clearest and most abundant evidence . It is a fact attested by the cow sciousness of every human being , whether learned or un // learned , and at every hour of his existence , that , when two courses of action are presented to him , he is free to choose between them , and therefore has only himself to approve or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this great truth is always acknowledged and acted upon , however the metaphysician may pretend to question it in his abstract speculation . Hence we all feel self-reproach or self-gratulation , after the consequences of our conduct have become manifest , because we know that we might have acted differently . It matters not that we can not explain how man is free ; so neither can we tell how gravitation binds the earth to its orbit , or brings back to the ground a stone that has been thrown into the air . The first principle of the Positive Philosophy requires us to accept the facts as we find them , whether they are susceptible of explanation or not . And the fact of human freedom is as undeniable as any phenomenon in the physical world , for it rests upon the clear and dogmatic assertion of consciousness . Mr. Buckle attempts to impeach the credibility of this testimony , on the ground , first , that many philosophers have denied , and justly too , that there is any independent or special faculty of consciousness , asserting that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of mind . But the objection only shows that he is incapable of understanding the doctrine that he cites , and that his acquaintance with psychology is extremely superficial . Sir William Hamilton censures Reid for degrading consciousness into a special faculty , rightly maintaining that it is an attribute of all our faculties ,  --  a general condition of the whole intellect . We can not know , without knowing that we know ; we can not feel , without knowing that we feel ; we can not will , without knowing that we will ; and this self-recognition , this knowledge that the mind possesses of its own phenomena , whereby we discriminate our own mental states and appropriate them as our own , is what we call consciousness . We degrade the authority of consciousness , then , when we reduce it to a special faculty ; we exalt it , when we affirm that it is a universal condition of intelligence , an indispensable prerequisite of all knowledge . We can not even doubt or deny , unless we are // conscious that we doubt or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the testimony of consciousness , becomes a feb de se . " Waiving this objection , " however , proceeds Mr. Buckle , " we may , in the second place , reply , that even if consciousness is a faculty , we have the testimony of all history to prove that it is extremely fallible . " And he proceeds to cite the changes of opinion , the various creeds , the different standards of truth , that have characterized different countries and ages , as instances of this fallibility . We are sorry to reply , that this objection betrays even greater ignorance than the former one . Consciousness does not affirm the validity , the truthfulness , of a judgment or opinion , but only the existence of that judgment as a present phenomenon of mind . Hence we are just as conscious of a wrong opinion as of a right one ; or , rather , we are conscious only of the belief itself , leaving it for subsequent inquiry and reflection to determine whether it is well or ill founded . We could make no progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if consciousness had not rightly informed us that we once entertained those errors . Mr. Buckle proceeds to ask , with great simplicity , " Are we not in certain circumstances conscious of the existence of spectres and phantoms , " though it is " generally admitted that such beings have no existence at all ? " Certainly not , we answer . We are conscious only of seeing indistinctly some white object in an imperfect light , and of believing it at the moment to be a spectre . And consciousness was right , as it always is ; we did see the object , and we did believe it to be a spectre : but examination a moment afterwards proved that the belief was wrong , for the supposed spectre was only an old white horse grazing in a churchyard . It is humiliating to be forced to explain so simple a distinction to any one but a school-boy . Mr. Buckle would lay the blame upon consciousness , if he should take a counterfeit coin , believing it to be a good one . Even a school-boy would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but his eyes and his judgment , were at fault . The leading idea of Mr. Buckle 's book , " the magnificent idea , " as he calls it , is , " that everytahing which occurs is regulated by law , and that confusion and disorder are impos // sible . " In the application of this idea to the course of human affairs , and especially to the human will , all that he expects us to concede is , " that , when we perform an action , we perform it in consequence of some motive or motives ; that those motives are the results of some antecedents " ; and consequently , if we knew all the antecedents , and their mode or law of action , we . could unerringly predict all that will follow . He subsequently defines free will to be " a cause of action residing in the mind , and exerting itself independently of motives . " Here the whole gist of the doctrine and of the argument depends upon the words which we Wave italicized . Certainly no competent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination of the will is " independent of " motives , in the sense of being made entirely without reference to them , just as if no motives existed . If it were so , then indeed human action would be wholly inconsequent and capricious , and man would be cursed with a freedom which he could not exercise except by resigning all the higher attributes of his nature . His freedom would be mere license ,  --  the caprice of an irrational being , to whom no one course of action appears better than another . But it is not so ; man is not only a free being , but a rational being ; capable of preferences , and having a sense of right and wrong ; endued with judgment and foresight . Because he is reasonable , his actions can generally be predicted by one who has a fair knowledge of his character and the special circumstances of the case ; because he is free , he not infrequently breaks away from his former courses , renounces old habits , gives the lie to former resolutions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstances have not changed , but he has changed . His former action had been " in consequence of " some leading motive , yet not in the sense of being enslaved to it , and necessarily yielding to its direction , just as a mass of brute matter inevitably follows a sufficient tractive force . Man does not thus yield , because man is not brute matter ; because he is not dead , but living , and has an innate force , which can resist both external circumstances and internal temptation . Motives do not act upon his will , but he acts upon the motives , - considers them , weighs them against each // other , suspends all action in reference to them uhtil they are thus fully weighed , and treats them always as subservient to his determination , never as controlling it , - as his guides , never as his masters . A weight suspended by a rope necessarily hangs always in the same direction , perpendicular to the horizon , unless drawn or pushed aside by some force external to itself . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we never see it deflected from a perpendicular without seeking some external cause for such deflexion . But a living man , suspended by his hands , can exert spontaneously the force that is in him to throw his body out of the line of gravitation ; and we know that the power thus exerted comes from within , - that the man moves himself . This , indeed , is an exertion of muscular power , and a physical antecedent can be found for it , in the nervous action which is needed to bring the muscles into play . But no such physical antecedent exists for the volition which brings out the nervous energy , and which is , in every sense of the word , spontaneous . We may assign a motive as the reason of such a volition , but not as its cause ; for causation implies power , and a reason or motive being a mere abstraction , a consideration present to the mind , it is absurd to consider it as exerting force . Force is an attribute of substance , not of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far as the will is identified with the man himself . A motive is a desire , which is a passive state of mind ; and it is notorious that desires and volitions often run in opposite directions , so that we desire one thing and will another . Like most of the modern speculatists who deny the freedom of the will , Mr. Buckle attempts to avoid some of the appalling consequences of Fatalism , by substituting for it what is called the doctrine of Necessity . But this is setting up a distinction without a difference . He asserts that " the actions of men , being determined solely by their antecedents , must have a character of uniformity , that is to say , must , under precisely the same circumstances , always issue in precisely the same results . " This is plain Fatalism ; the circumstances being what they were , the man could not have acted otherwise ; then he is not responsible for that action . But among these // " antecedents " the Necessitarians admit not only the external circumstances by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and character , - the general bent of mind by which he inclines to one course of action rather than another . They immediately add , however , that this prevailing disposition or character is still determined for him and not by him , - that is , determined by previous circumstances , whose action upon his own mind he could not avoid . Wherein , then , consists his freedom ? It matters not whether his action is determined by immediate or remote external events , if the determination in either case is absolute and necessary . If physical antecedents form the character , and then the character determines the volition , it is evidently the same thing as if those antecedents acted directly upon the will . This distinction of the Necessitarians may be illustrated by that part of the process for the manufacture of shot , whereby the globules which are perfectly spherical are separated from those of irregular shape , by allowing all of them to roll down an inclined plane . The perfectly spherical shot roll in a straight line from the top to the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's theory , their course being determined exclusively by an external force , - that of gravitation . On the Necessitarian hypothesis , minds are like the imperfectly formed shot , whose course is determined not only by gravitation , but by their own lob-sidedness , which causes them , instead of moving straight onward , to waddle off to one side , and there stop . But their imperfect sphericity is determined for them , and not by them , by the previous action of the shot-maker in forming the globules . They govern themselves only in this wise : they have been so badly formed that they wander out of what would otherwise be the track of their destiny . Are they any the more free , or self-determined , for that ? For the support of his theory , Mr. Buckle does not depend much on psychological observation or metaphysical reasoning . He relies chiefly upon such statistical evidence as has been collected by M. Quetelet and other observers , which has disclosed great uniformity in human actions , even in some particulars where it was least expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided it be a very large one , the number of murders , of suicides , and of persons accused of various crimes , varies but little from year to year , and maintains about the same proportion to the whole number of the people . Even the various instruments with which these crimes are committed are employed in nearly the same degree of frequency . It is not pretended that the coincidence is accurate . The annual number of suicides in London , for the five years preceding 1850 , varied from 213 to 266 , or about twenty-five per cent . As larger aggregates are taken , however , the rate of variation is less . Thus , the average number for these five years is 242 ; and it is believed , though the returns are not given , that the corresponding average for the five years immediately prece* ing , or immediately subsequent , would not vary from this number perhaps more than ten per cent . The uniformity of the law , which is obvious enough when the numbers are very large , is obscured as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is argued , of small disturbing forces and minor laws , which render the case more complicated . It is only when these perturbations are eliminated , or reduced to insignificance by the multitude of cases , that the working of the great social law becomes manifest . Mr. Buckle 's inference is , that human actions in the long run depend upon great laws affecting the general state of society , and not upon the peculiarities of individuals . Murder and suicide may seem to be infrequent and abnormal acts , contingent on accidental combinations of events and the idiosyncrasies of peculiar temperaments . But even here , statisticians demonstrate , if their observations have been broad enough , that great uniformity prevails , and the constant periodical repetition of the deed points to the steady operation of some u*iiform cause , which has not yet perhaps been traced or aiialyzed . Are not such results , however , precisely what we ought to expect , on the supposition that man is not only free , but intelligent ? Reason and foresight , under similar circumstances , lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , is not as perfect as if it had been produced by the blind and unimpeded operation of some mechanical cause . But it is precisely this partial uniformity which the returns of the // statistician indicate . If all action were mechanical and necessary , there would be no need of uniting a great multitude of cases in order to reveal the law of that action ; the results would be as uniform as the successive strokes of a steamengine . The fingers of a hand-loom weaver do not give as regular action to the shuttle as it receives in the power-loom ; and yet the motion is so uniform that , for hours together , the hand of the workman seems to be almost a portion of the machine . Tell that workman , however , that his action is necessary or uncontrollable , that he is not free to make the movement faster or slower , or to intermit it . altogether , and he will laugh in your face . Where did M. Comte or his English disciple learn , that all phenomena which are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They might as well have confounded the law of morals with the law of gravitation ; for though the former is addressed to free and intelligent beings , and the latter describes only the action of brute atoms , the uniformity of the result may be nearly the same in the one case as in the other . After all , the attempt to discover laws of nature through the rude approximations of statistics , employing numbers enormously large , and manipulating them by the method of averages and the doctrine of probabilities , is a procedure that can hardly be dignified with the name of science . A laW of nature does not deserve its name if it be not precise and unerring . But an average is only a compensation of errors , and just the same average is struck whether the errors are large or small . Ten is the arithmetical mean , not only between nine and eleven , but between one and nineteen , and all the corresponding intermediate numbers . If a man fires a great number of shots at a target , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether he is a very poor marksman or a very good one . For as there is no reason why the deviations or errors should be in any one direction from the centre rather than any other , the mean of all these deviations will indicate precisely the same point , whether the circle including them all be six inches or six feet in radius . The figures cited by Mr. Buckle show , that the average proportion of suicides to the whole population of London , taking the mean of several years , // is about one to ten thousand . But in order that this fact may answer his purpose , which is to prove that a human being is a mere machine , moved only by antecedents that are rigorously subject to law , it must be interpreted to signify that there is a suicidal propensity in human nature equal to just one tenthousandth part of the sum of all the impulses by which that nature is governed . Now , among one hundred thousand Londoners , taken at random , not a single suicide may occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand , taken in like manner , there may be , within the same time , one hundred cases . Neither of these facts , considered separately , is reconcilable with Mr. Buckle 's law , while their mean result seems to him to substantiate that law . According to such reasoning , the mean result of two falsehoods is a truth . And in order to obtain his approximate result , rude as it is , he is obliged to class together events which are really very dissimilar . A suicide caused by failure in business is not the same thing with one produced by religious fanaticism , or another committed when the patient was raving mad . It is idle to suppose that one law of nature governs cases so unlike as those of Chatterton , Clive , Romilly , Castlereagh , Haydon , and Sadleir . The doctrine of probabilities , an obscure reference to which is the basis of Mr. Buckle 's reasoning , is a law which governs the expectations of men respecting a certain event , and not a law controlling the event itself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be probable or likely , which we expect to happen ; but it is a vulgar error , and one into which Mr. Buckle has fallen , to believe that such expectation , however great , creates any physical impulse or tendency which will contribute to make it happen . If a hundred thousand balls are placed in an urn , and but one of them is black , it is physically just as possible that I should draw that one black ball at the first trial , as any other , though the probability of doing so is but one out of a hundred thousand . Nay , if each of these balls is numbered separately from one up to a hundred thousand , I must draw at the first trial some one number which was just as unlikely to come uppermost as the single black ball . But we have dwelt too long upon Mr. Buckle 's philosophy // of history , to the exclusion of the history itself , if the extraordinary selection of facts and disquisitions which he has brought together can be dignified with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to examine the history of what man has been , and what he has done , in oi*der to ascertain the laws both of his being and of his action . He begins by assuming that there are two sets of laws to which man is subject , the laws of matter and the laws of mind . Where man is more powerful than nature , as he generally is in Europe , the latter class of laws prevail , or have the most influence in shaping his conduct and welfare ; but where nature is the stronger , as it has been in all countries out of Europe , physical laws have the strongest influence . This is one of the rash and hasty generalizations which are perfectly characteristic of our author . He has no caution or reserve as a speculatist ; he never seeks for the exceptions to a principle , or the limitations of it , though a careful study of these generally leads to such a modified statement of the geI1* eral maxim as alters its whole character and application . But if Mr. Buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be winked out of sight , he wastes his strength on an attempt to explain it away . He mutilates the facts , that he may force them into accordance with his theory . The European has generally triumphed , and the Asiatic generally failed , in the contest with nature , not because the former had fewer physical obstacles to contend with , or fewer physical enervating influences *b resist ; but because the European was strong , and the Asiatic weak , in those moral and intellectual resources which always give the victory against any odds . Many large regions of Asia , and even of Africa , afford as favorable sites for civilization , so far as physical conditions are concerned , as the most favored districts of Europe , where the arts long since found a permanent home . But we should insult our readers by pausing to enumerate such obvious exceptions to the general principle thus dogmatically enounced . Our own position is , that a man is everywhere stronger than nature , except perhaps within the Arctic and Antarctic Circles , or on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not isolated man , but men leagued in society , however rude , and thereby bringing to the // struggle the united strength of intellects and muscles banded together and aiding each other . If they ever succumb in the contest , their defeat is owing to their own vices and degeneracy , and not to physical influences too strong to be resisted . The Esquimaux and the Laplander can live even within the limits of the Arctic Circle ; and the Icelanders , on the very borders of it , have kept up civilization for nearly a thousand years . But let us follow Mr. Buckle to his own ground , - to a consideration of those physical influences which , as he would have us believe , everywhere but in Europe , - that is , over at least fourteen fifteenths of the earth 's landed surface , - have either civilized man in spite of himself , or have successfully resisted his own best efforts to emerge from barbarism . The Necessitarian may well triumph if he can make out , for so large a portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shaping human destiny . He does not weary us with a long catalogue of the natural agencies by which the welfare of the human race is most affected . He enumerates only four , - Climate , Soil , Food , and what he calls the " General Aspect of Nature , " meaning thereby those imposing and awful features of natural scenery , which , by inflaming the imagination , generate superstition , and thus most effectually retard the progress of the human race . We object at once to this enumeration as both redundant and defective ; - redundant , as embracing both Soil and Food , though the most important office of the former is to produce the latter , so that the two should be counted but as one ; and defective , because , to say nothing of other omissions , it leaves out Geographical Position , which is , perhaps , the most important of them all . A more attentive consideration of Assyrian , Egyptian , Greek , Roman , and English civilization might possibly convince Mr. Buckle , that a situation along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the possession of a long line of deeply indented sea-coast , is a circumstance highly favorable to the rise and continuance of civilization . We are not reconciled , moreover , to the exclusion of another important element , Inherited Qualities of Race , merely by the quotation of a magisterial remark by Mr. Mill , that " of all vulgar 45* // modes of escaping from the consideration of the effect of social and moral influences on the human mind , the most vulgar is that of attributing the diversities of conduct and character to inherited natural differences . " We hold that there is one more vulgar still ; and that is , to attribute a preponderant influence to Food and Climate . And though not placing so much stress as many naturalists have done on the peculiarities of the so-called Varieties of Mankind , we still think that there is a good deal in the history and the present condition of the Mongolian , the African , the American , and the Circassian races to sustain the belief , that these races are distinguished from one another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mind . But faulty as Mr. Buckle 's enumeration is , to analyze and develop the manner in which the habits and characters of different nations have been affected by peculiarities of their Climate , Food , Soil , and Scenery would have been an agreeable and instructive disquisition . Montesquieu began such an analysis , but left it very imperfect . No opponent of the doctrine of necessity denies that men adapt their habits to their circumstances , that their customs and tastes are flexible , and that even their characters are gradually modified by a change in their habits and pursuits . All this is an evidence rather of man 's power than of his weakness . To adopt Lord Bacon 's phrase , Man conquers Nature by obeying her laws . He is born a cosmopolite ; he can dive everywhere , except , as we have said , in the regions of perpetual frost ; and habit can endear the most rugged and unpromising country to him , and can make it&amp; rigors minister to his comfort . But this is too simple a view for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere but in Europe , not as the helpmeet and often the master of Nature , but as her slave . And his description of the means and process , as well as of the results , of this subjugation , is most extraordinary . Some of the most controverted theories of English political economy , first suggested by the peculiar condition of the laboring classes in England and Ireland for the last hundred years , doubtful even in relation to them , and unquestionably false in their application to any other country and age , are here // brought forward as the keys of universal history , and as alone adequate to explain all the peculiarities of llindoo and Egyptian character and civilization throughout forty centuries . Malthus 's doctrine of population and Ricardo 's theory of rent have been put to hard service by their authors , but were never before required to solve such problems as these . The bare attempt to make such use of them is an anachronism and a blunder . Who told Mr. Buckle that the population of Egypt under the Pharaohs was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria , or that the cause of the people 's misery in either case was that they multiplied too fast , and not rather the pressure of institutions and laws which avowedly favored the unequal distribution of wealth ? Ireland has never been so thickly peopled as Belgium , it has at least an equally fertile soil , and both these countries annually export large quantities of food . How idle is it , then , to attribute the suffering of the Irish or of the ancient Egyptians to their numbers having outrun their subsistence , instead of tracing the evil to the form of polity by which they were oppressed ! The institution of Castes on the largest scale , an institution which has its origin and its support in political and religious considerations , has always been the characteristic feature of Hindoo and Egyptian civilization ; and where the system of Caste is rigidly enforced , there is no freedom of competition in the dealings between man and man , and consequently no division of value into its three component elements . Even where African slavery continues to exist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits disappears , the increase or diminution of the laboring class depends solely on the will of the master , which is regulated by calculations of profit , and the theories of Malthus and Ricardo , consequently , are as little applicable as they would be in a community like that of the Shakers , where all property is held in common and no intercourse is permitted between the sexes . Mr. Buckle 's eagerness to represent the character and conduct of men as determined by merely physical antecedents , and hence to solve the problems of history through the discoveries of modern physical science , has led him to make as rash use of chemistry and physiology in his work , as of political // economy . Perhaps a childish vanity of displaying the extent of his acquaintance with the various sciences has often unconsciously determined the character of his speculations . Thus , he sometimes laboriously constructs a complicated scientific explanation of a fact or phenomenon so simple in itself , that it is only darkened by any attempt to render it more intelligible . " The inhabitants of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consume large quantities of whale oil and blubber ; while within the tropics , the ordinary food consists almost entirely of fruit , rice , and other vegetables . " The reason is obvious . Where no vegetables whatever are produced , as in the ice-bound regions of the North , the inhabitants live upon the only food that is within their reach ; while the ilindoos find a vegetable diet the cheapest . But this is too simple a view of the matter to answer Mr. Buckle 's purpose . He must lug in by the ears a long disquisition on some very questionable chemical speculations of Liebig , whereby the heat of the human body is traced to the use of highly carbonized food ; and we are gravely informed that the oils contain six times as much carbon as the fruits . Animal food is more difficult to be had , and more of it is needed , in cold countries than in hot ones ; therefore wages tend to be lower in tropical regions than in Northern Europe . Hence the lamentable paradox of the English school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after being falsely applied to account for the miseries of Ireland , is here brought forward to explain the origin and character of Asiatic civilization . The whole theory is confuted by experience in America , where food is cheaper and wages are higher than in Great Britain . Moreover , all classes in our Southern Slave States , countries of the orange and the sugar-cane , habitually use more animal food than the laboring Scotch , who live about thirty degrees nearer the North Pole . Mr. Buckle reasons thus - A fat soil and a hot climate make cheap food ; cheap food depresses wages ; low wages cause an unequal distribution of wealth ; and inequality of wealth produces an inequality of political power and social influence . But these inequalities exist in Russia in as great , if not a greater , degree than in Southern Asia ; and Russia unfortunately is a very cold country , where the need of animal food is very pressing . In truth , // experience and common sense should teach Mr. Buckle to invert his order of cause and effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and military usurpations he should find the origin of despotic power ; to despotic and aristocratic institutions he should trace the inequality of wealth ; and the great body of poverty thus created keeps wages depressed , and reduces the laborer to the poorest possible diet , even where nature 's bounty makes rich food abundant and cheap . But as such reasoning would prove man to be more powerful than nature , or the human will to be independent of physical antecedents , it does not suit our author 's purpose . We must not dwell longer on the details of this gloomy and scandalous theory , and can only point out in general terms the grand fallacy of the argument by which it is supported . Take any scheme of social philosophy , any theory of human life and character , however extravagant , and allow its author to range over the history of all countries and ages for facts and illustrations which may seem to harmonize with it , while he is not expected to notice any that contradict it , nor to enter into any detailed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is not made to appear ingenious and plausible , and if careless readers do not accept it as sound and able speculation . In this Introduction to his great work , an Introduction which already fills two bulky volumes , Mr. Buckle revels in the large results of his desultory studies and omnivorous reading . He has brought together a vast magazine of the scraps of learning , and weaves them into any fabric that may suit his fancy , rather than his judgment . He is not pinned down to any method , he is not confined to any principle of selection . He has put under contribution all science , all philosophy , and all history , at liberty to cull what he chose , and careful not to see anything which would obstruct his progress , suggest difficulties , or mar in any way the harmony of his fabric . In the same chapter , and even the same paragraph , he glances from India to Peru , from the polar regions to Arabia , from the history of the tenth century before Christ to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wealth and civilization of ancient Peru are attributed to the lavish bounty of nature , the fact being conveniently for gotten , // that over a large portion of that country rain never falls ; while California , better watered than Peru , is described as a parched and sterile region , in order that the lack of moisture and the consequent dearness of food may explain the uncivilized state of its aboriginal inhabitants . Brazil , again , where all the resources of natural wealth exist in measureless profusion , never became civilized , as this author tells us , precisely on account of the abundance of her riches . Nature is too potent for man ; her rivers and forests are too grand ; vegetation is too luxuriant ; animal life is too varied and abundant ; " enormous meadows , reeking with heat and moisture , " afford nourishment to too many herds of wild cattle . Why , according to Mr. Buckle 's theory , Brazil , before it was visited by Europeans , ought to have been the most civilized country in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soil , and food civilized India , Egypt , and Peru , a still greater measure of those blessings ought to have done as much , or more , for ancient Brazil . Mr. Buckle forgets , also , that the central and southern portions of the United States , including nearly the whole of the magnificent valley of the Mississippi , present just that assemblage of physical conditions to which , as he maintains , the superior civilization of Europe herself owes its origin . If the qualities of race count for nothing , but merely physical agencies do all , and if , consequently , all refinement and progress must be of home origin , created and nourished by the natural influences of the region within which they exist , then ilendrik Hudson , John Smith , and William Penn ought to have found here a more advanced civilization than that which they brought with them . Besides , as the great physical features of a country remain unchanged through all time , all that depends upon them ought to be equally permanent and irreversible . The climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same now that they were under Sesostris or Porus ; but the semi-bar* barous condition of their native inhabitants exhibits no trace of the arts , culture , and refinement which distinguished their ancestors thousands of years ago . Even the languages have perished which contain the records of their ancient civilization , except so far as they have been recovered by the inge // nuity and learning of European scholars . And what was the condition of Britain , Gaul , and Germany , down to at least as late a period as the fall of the Roman empire in the West ? They were surrounded by the same physical agencies then as now ; but the light of civilization had hardly yet dawned upon them . A discovery of the laws of European history being resolved by Mr. Buckle primarily into a study of the laws of the human mind , and his method ofpsychological study consisting merely in the observation of phenomena and in the application to them of the principles of all inductive science , we have the first grand result of his investigations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths alone are progressive . Hence , he concludes , we are to look for the advancement of the race to the development of the intellect , and not at all to the cultivation of the moral feelings . The progress of society must be measured " by the amount and success of their intellectual activity . " No discoveries are possible in ethics ; the great body of moral truths remains unchanged from one age to another , and all nations instinctively recognize them . Whatever changes take place in the opinions of men , or whatever improvements are effected in their condition , can not be attributed , therefore , to moral influences , but must be due to the discoveries of the intellect . To adopt our author 's own strong and unqualified language , " the growth of European civilization is solely due to the progress of knowledge , and the progress of knowledge depends on the number of truths which the human intellect discovers , and on the extent to which they are diffused . " There is a confusion of thought here , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either into a barren truism or a transparent falsehood . Even if discoveries were possible in the province of morals , it would be the business of the intellect to make them . A man can not see except by the use of his eyes , nor investigate truth except by an intellectual process . The function of conscience , or the moral nature of man , is entirely different ; it is not to separate truth from error , but to regulate conduct . Its office is monition , not discovery ; it is not so much a guide as a master , for it // speaks , not to instruct , but to command . It is a mere truism , then , to say , that its laws are the same yesterday , to-day , and forever , and that they admit neither of enlargement nor repeal . But this is not Mr. Buckle 's meaning . He intends to say , that the increased happiness of a community and its progress in civilization depend altogether upon the cultivation of the intellect , and not at all upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untruth , contradicted by all history . " The two oldest , greatest , most inveterate , and most widely spread evils which have ever been known , " he tells us , are religious persecution and war ; these have been constantly diminishing ; and " their diminutio.n has been effected , not at all by moral feelings , nor by moral teachings , but solely by the activity of the human intellect , and by the inventions and discoveries which , in a long course of successive ages , man has been able to make . " And as in respect to these two great evils , so also in inferior matters , the same process has been followed , and the same law holds . " The actions of bad men produce only temporary evil , the actions of good men only temporary good ; and eventually the good and the evil altogether subside . " They offset and neutralize each other , leaving the progress of the human race to be effected solely by the discoveries of genius , " which are immortal and never leave us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of his work , that " the progress Europe has made from barbarism to civilization is entirely due to its intellectual activity " ; and that the occasional disturbances produced by moral agencies " are but aberrations , which , if we compare long periods of time , balance each other , and thus , in the total amount , entirely disappear . " And as morality has effected nothing for the human race , so religion has done worse ; it has been a positive curse , the greatest bane of mankind . Religious persecution , as has been stated , has produced more affliction , has done more harm , has been a greater obstruction to progress , than any other evil , - than all other evils united . This is the thesis which nearly the whole of Mr. Buckle 's second volume , and a large portion of his first , are designed to prove . The rise of scepticism , in // his opinion , is the first condition for the beginning of progress , for any improvement in science , art , civilization , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the great evil with which mankind have had to contend . An abstract of the history of Spain and Scotland , or rather a copious gleaning of facts from that history , partial and onesided in the extreme , fills the second volume , the sole object being to prove that superstition is the greatest of all errors , and religious persecution the most fearful scourge , that mankind have ever known . And the evil of this intolerance , we are specially taught , is only enhanced by the purity of intention and sincerity of belief of those who manifest it . In a moral point of view , the motives of religious persecutors are unimpeachable . " Diminish the sincerity , and you will diminish the persecution ; in other words , by weakening the virtue you may check the evil . " Thus a double point is made against both morality and religion ; they are two poisons which enhance and stimulate each other . Fortunately , the intellectual progress of the race is fast conquering both evils , or leaving them behind in the great march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , political economy and improved means of locomotion , gunpowder , the steam-engine , and the magnetic telegraph , - these are at once the agents and the results of human progress ; these wage unceasing war against credulity and intolerance , and ultimately triumph over them . The discoveries of great men contain those eternal truths which " outlive the struggles of rival creeds , and witness the decay of successive religions . All these have their different measures and their different standards ; one set of opinions for one age , another set for another . They pass away like a dream ; they are as the fabric of a vision , which leaves not a rack behind . " And these are the results of Mr. Buckle 's study of the history of civilization ! These are the conclusions to which he has been led by studying the laws of the human mind , not according to the usual method of the psychologist , the moral-* ist , and the theist , through the testimony of consciousness , - " not simply as they appear in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actions of mankind at // large " ; - that is , as they appear in the evidence of statistics , and other recorded facts of history and science ! This improved method is not original with him ; it is the method of Comte , Mill , and other Positivists and radical philosophers . It is the necessary procedure of those who overlook or contemn the testimony of consciousness , deny the freedom of the will , and extend the dominion of physical laws to the entire exclusion of the supernatural or providential element in human affairs . We would do no injustice to the present advocate of these doctrines . As nearly as our limits would permit , we have stated his conclusions in his own language ; and we would refer any who may doubt the correctness of the outline to his own fuller statement of them in the fourth chapter of his first volume . Not without reason , then , have we described him as a pupil and imitator of Hobbes , though the philosopher of Malmesbury was the unblushing advocate of despotism in politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness in morals , while Mr. Buckle fiercely asserts the rights of individuals against any interference or any claim of authority by church or state . But he manifests the same arrogant contempt as his great predecessor for the best sympathies and feelings of mankind . Extremes meet ; the absolutist and the radical start from the same premises , move by a common impulse , and arrive at what are essentially the same conclusions . Both show the same inclination for paradox , the same disposition to fly in the face of the dearest convictions of their fellow-men , and both adopt the same brutal tone of expression towards those whose feelings they outrage . We have no scruples about drawing this parallel , as Mr. Buckle will doubtless deem himself honored by the comparison . But we would remind him that notoriety is not fame , that recklessness is no proof of courage , and that he who abjures caution and sobriety of manner , and even a decent regard for the feelings of his opponents , casts away the best safeguards of successful investigation , and does his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he adduces in favor of the doctrine that the moral feelings of mankind do not , in the long run , aid their progress or improve their condition , is too characteristic // of the writer and of his method to escape notice . It is founded on the assertion of the statisticians already alluded to , that the annual amount of crime in a country is reproduced , year after year , with considerable uniformity . Then the moral fe ! 4ings of an individual , he argues , may exert great influence on the amount of his own transgressions , but will not at all diminish the aggregate of crime in the community to which he belongs . His motives for well-doing , then , must be selfish ; he may lessen his own culpability , but he will not benefit society , which must still contend against as much misconduct as ever . Even though we may be conscious , therefore , that moral principles regulate our own conduct , " we have incontrovertible proof that they produce not the least effect on mankind in the aggregate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallacy here is so transparent , that we marvel both at its escaping detection in itself , and at its failing to disclose the erroneousness , and even the absurdity , of the method of reasoning which led to it . Society is nothing but an aggregate of individuals , and the whole amount of crime registered in a year is but the sum total of the separate offences committed within that period . He who overcomes temptation but in a single instance lessens that sum by unity ; and this is a positive gain to the community , and a gain which is greater or less in proportion to the heinousness of the offence in question , and not in proportion to the number of other crimes with which it is compared . Mr. Buckle 's mode of reducing the magnitude of this gain to insignificance , through " the precaution of studying social phenomena for a period sufficiently long and on a scale sufficiently great , " - that is , by counting it only as one case out of a thousand , or one out of a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , who should attempt to lessen his estimate of the size of an obstacle by regarding it from so great a distance that theVnountain would seem to the eye no larger than a mole-hill . It is his estimate of the magnitude , and not the magnitude itself , which he lessens by this ingenious folly , this attempt at selfdeception . The statistical method , as we have already hinted , is a means , not of avoiding , but of hiding errors , by // Oct. setting them off one against another . It is a compensation of blunders . But the great fallacy which underlies the whole of Mr. Buckle 's doctrine and argument arises from the vagueness and uncertainty in his use of the word civilization . It is with good reason that he has omitted , as we have already mentioned , to define what that is of which he has attempted to write the history . Had he even attempted , such a definition , he must have recognized the absurdity of his theory . And what an omission ! It is as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new scheme of philosophy , should execute half of his work before settling in his own mind , or informing his readers , what logic or philosophy is . His edifice is far advanced towards completion , but he has forgotten to lay its foundation . The only word which he uses as synonymous with Civilization is Progress , a term which is still more loose and uncertain in its signification . He means , though he does not directly say so , the Progress of Knowledge ; and if any one should attempt , by a large induction from many passages of his work , to ascertain what Civilization , according to Mr. Buckle , means , the answer would undoubtedly be the Progress and Diffusion of Knowledge . This is the assumption on which his whole theory is built ; and his parallel assumption is , that the advancement of knowledge constitutes , and is the measure of , human power and happiness . Thus understood , his paradoxical assertion , that the cultivation of the intellect , and not of the conscience , is the source and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an identical proposition . Certainly , intellect is the only means of the advancement of knowledge , and conscience has nothing to do with it , except indirectly . A more harmless platitude was never uttered . But in this sense it is not true that civilization is the same thing as happiness , or the only means of secuig happiness . For happiness depends on the due regulation of the passions and the conduct ; and this is the province of morality and religion , the cultivation of the intellect having , at the best , but a remote and indirect agency in the work . The sorrowful confession of many a philosopher and man of science , the history of many a genius , - nay , the // experience of half mankind , -* attests , that the increase of knowledge is not necessarily the increase of happiness . We now know how to construe our author 's oft repeated assertions , that " civilization is regulated by the accumulation and diffusion of knowledge , " and that " the growth of European civilization is solely due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two elements , which he here places in the nominal relation of cause and effect ; he means that civilization is the progress of knowledge . This is merely an unauthorized use of language , which constantly leads the reader astray , and hides the author 's vagueness of meaning and unsoundness of argument . We can rightly appreciate the doctrine and the reasoning only by defining at the outset what people generally mean by Civilization . We say , then , that the Civilization of a community means its happiness , so far as this is secured by the prevalence of morality , intelligence , and refinement of taste , and by the general enjoyment of the products of the fine and the useful arts . For the correctness of this definition , we can only appeal to the dictionary and the general usage of the best writers . Taking this signification of the word along with us , Mr. Buckle 's doctrine ceases to be even plausible ; it is simply absurd . The highest degree of civilization ever attained by the ancients - and it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never equalled - was that of Athens under Pericles . But what did the knowledge even of the wisest Athenians amount to ? And of what discoveries or inventions could they boast ? It is little to say , that a pupil fn one of our high schools knows vastly more than the best of them did . In their times , not one of the physical sciences had begun to unroll the secrets of nature . They knew a little geometry , a very little astronomy and natural history ; as to their acquisitions or speculations in logic , rhetoric , ethics , and metaphysics , Mr. Buckle will hardly dignify these with the name of science . But why need we state the case in our own language , when we can borrow the weighty words of one who was the greatest scholar , and one of the greatest thinkers , of the present century ? 46* // " Every learner in science , " sayS Sir William Hamilton , " is now familiar with more truths than Aristotle or Plato ever dreamt of knowing ; yet , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even of the masters of ' modern science , rank higher than intellectual barbarians ! Ancient Greece and modern Europe prove , indeed , that the march of intellect ' is no inseparable concomitant of the march of science ' ; that the cultivation of the individual is not to be rashly confounded with the progress of the species. ** The brightest period in the history of Roman civilization , the age of Augustus , ranks much below the age of Pericles , simply because morality and philosophy had declined , both in the schools and in their influence on society . In ethics and philosophy , Cicero was but a feeble copyist and translator of his Greek teachers , and his is the only name that deserves mention . The fire of patriotism had burnt out , and the standard of morality , both in public and private life , had fallen so low as to threaten society itself , not so much with dissolution as with putrescence . Under the second and third Emperors , at least , if not under the first , the only motto for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture seemed to be , " Let us eat and drink , for to-morrow we die . " Among the upper and middle classes , even the love of offspring had been overpowered by the love of vice . Population rapidly declined . Patricians disowned or I gave away their children , if they had any , willed their property to strangers , and , after leading a life of extreme licentiousness and effeminacy , showed some remains of the old IRonian spirit only in the cheerfulness and alacrity with which they opened their veins , or took poison , after they had been denounced to the Emperor . Satire was the only branch of poetry which the Romans may be said to have created , and in which they really excelled ; for satire alone had a legitimate theme , and abundant materials for its work . In Horace and Juvenal , the laughing and the indignant satirist , we find such pictures as literature nowhere else affords of a civilization which had become thoroughly corrupt and debased , - which had really ceased to be civilization , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction under Trajan and the Antonines , caused partly by the vigorous rule // and stoical morality of these Emperors , and partly by the influence of Christianity , which had begun to pervade the middle and lower classes , and was working from them upward . But the reaction was short-lived , as no extraneous causes could check a decline that had already become so marked and proceeded so far . Christianity found its proper work in taming the ferocity and modelliiig the characters of the rude barbarians from the North , who trampled out the last vestiges of Roman power and civilization . Yet , from Pericles to Nero , it can not be denied that mere knowledge had increased . Archimedes and Hipparchus had made important additions to physical science . The Julian reformation of the calendar was a considerable step in advance . There were writers of some note in natural history , agriculture , and architecture . According to Mr. Buckle 's mode of judging , it can not be denied that the world had made progress , - that Pliny and Seneca knew more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pompeii , that the Romans had made great advances in the useful arts , for their houses were furnished with many conveniences and luxuries which the Athenians in their palmiest days had never dreamed of . But humanity had little reason to boast itself of this " march of science , for not even Mr. Buckle will dare to deny , in this instance at least , that the advancement of knowledge was accompanied by a woful decline of every element that constitutes true civilization . Coming down to modern times , we find still more abundant means of refuting the paradoxical and debasing doctrine of this book . So far from its being true , " that the growth of European civilization is solely due to the progress of knowledge , and that the progress of knowledge depends on the number of truths which the human intellect discovers , and on the extent to which they are diffused , " while morality and religion are either of no account or positively injurious , - so far , we say , is this humiliating assertion from the truth , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tokens of modern civilization are those institutions of beneficence , those reforms of old abuses , vices , and crimes , and that amelioration of legal codes and private manners , // which have added most to the happiness of the human race , and which are directly and undeniably traceable to the influence of morality and religion ; while the mere discovery of new truths , the enlarged boundaries of science , and the triumphs of intellect , have had little or no share in producing them . This is our thesis , and it has at least this advantage over Mr. Buckle 's , that it is one which we are not ashamed to avow and defend ; while he is driven to the humiliating acknowledgment , that his " conclusions are no doubt very unpalatable , " that they are even " peculiarly offensive , " and the only apology he can offer is the cold-blooded one , that " the unpleasantness of a statement is hardly to be considered a proof of its falsity . " We say , then , that hospitals , public schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruction of the ignorant , - the amelioration of prisons , the abolition of the slave-trade , the humane treatment of prisoners of war , and the growing disuse of brutal sports , are the chief features of difference between barbarous and civilized nations at the present day ; and that for all of them we are indebted to the increased cultivation of the moral feelings , to the greater activity of conscience , and - we will not be deterred by Mr. Buckle 's sneers from adding - to pulpits , priests , and sermons . If he denies this assertion , let him point out any nation upon earth before the Christian era , or any barbarous or unconverted nation of the present day , in which such institutions have been erected , such efforts made , and such improvements effected by the spontaneous concurrence of government and people . If any instances can be mentioned , and they must be few and weak , they are found probably among the Mohammedans , the better part of whose morality and humanity , it will be generally acknowledged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian Scriptures . Modern civilization is distinguished from ancient chiefly by an increased tenderness for human life , and an increased anxiety to relieve human suffering . It is not that men did not before know how to spare or to pity . It is not that the progress of discovery and invention has now first enabled us , or taught us how , to be merciful and charitable . // In earlier times , power and intellect were not wanting , but will ; the attempt was never made . We would not be unjust to Science ; she has done much as the handmaid of morality and religion . She has rendered asylums for the poor , the sick , the maimed , the blind , the deaf and dumb , more efficient ; but she never originated them . She has been often the hired , often the volunteer , servant of charity . But in all her proper and peculiar work , no one will deny that the pride of intellect and the desire of reputation have been added to the love of knowledge as her motives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , first stimulated and rendered active and efficient - Mr. Buckle will not allow us to say first discovered - by the Christian religion . We claim them for the only gospel that was specially , and by its Founder , " preached to the poor , " whose first precept is , " Love your enemies , " whose first benedictions fell on those " that mourn , " on " the merciful , " and the pure in heart , " and whose first caution is , that " when thou doest alms , let not thy left hand know what thy right hand doeth . " Mr. Buckle says , that these and similar dogmas " have been known for thousands of years , " and " that the system of morals propounded in the New Testament contained no maxim which had not been previously enunciated , and that some of the most beautiful passages in the Apostolic writings are quotations from Pagan authors , is well known to every scholar . " As the single brief citation , a part of one line , which St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a very insufficient foundation for this last broad assertion , we are compelled to believe that our author has made some discoveries in the Apostolic writings which are not " known to every scholar , " or indeed to any one except himself . And against the former statement we place the authority of one of the greatest metaphysicians of modern times , and one who was certainly not so much a friend as an opponent of the Christian religion . In his " Religion within the Limits of mere Reason , " Kant cites these and other moral precepts , taken chiefly from the Sermon on the Mount , " as proofs of the divine mission " of Him who uttered them , and of " the honor due to him as // founder of the first true church . " * It is idle to say that isolated hints of one or more of them , taken separately , can be found here and there , after great search , in the writings of some Pagan moralists . He who first announced them collectively , in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a message from God to man , is their true author , their original promulgator and voucher . Let him who doubts or denies this assertion point to the first heathen nation that has reduced them to practice in such institutions and endeavors as we have meiitioned , or to the first Christian nation that has not done this . We deny that the mere advancement of science , the discovery of new facts and truths , whether physical or purely speculative , however gratifying to the pride of intellect and honorable to the genius of the discoverer , has had any but an indirect and comparatively feeble influence on the progress of civilization . Such discoveries are the effects , not the causes , of that " prevalence of morality , intelligence , and refinement of taste , " in which , as we have said , true civilization consists . Now , the only two of these elements which can come into question here , intelligence and refinement , whether of an individual or a nation , are not increased or heightened in proportion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recur to the instance already given , of the Athenians in their palmiest days as compared with any nation or age for fifteen centuries after the glory of Athens had departed , we will take what is , so far as discovery is concerned , the brightest epoch of modern times . This is unquestionably the age of Newton and Leibnitz , of Boyle , Hooke , ilnyghens , Von Guericke , Cassini , Pascal , Wren , and a crowd of other illustrious names . Designated by its principal sovereigns , it was the age of Charles II. , Louis XIV. , and Leopold I. But no Englishman or German will refer with pride to the history of his country during this period , or will maintain that the general civilization of his people was then either at its height , or making more rapid progress than it.had done for several generations before . Generally , it was an age of licentious manners * Die Religion inner/Laib e.ler Grenzen der blossen Vernuift . Kant 's Werke , Ed . Rosenkranz . Band X. 5. 190. // and feeble public spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to elevate the condition of the laboring classes , - when courts were corrupt , and the people enslaved . France , it is true , was then in her Augustan age , but her glory consisted in her literature , not in her science . Mr. Buckle even maintains that her literary splendor in those times was " the work of the great generation " that had just passed away ; that " the absence in France , during this period , not only of great discoveries , but also of mere practical ingenuity , is certainly very striking " ; and , generally , that " the age of Louis XIV . was an age of decay : it was an age of misery , intolerance , and oppression ; it was an age of bondage , of ignominy , of intolerance . " All this is coarsely exaggerated , and marked by our author 's usual recklessness of statement and brutality of expression . The French of that day certainly showed great refinement of taste and elegance of culture , and , amidst much tinsel splendor , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literature and art . But their triumphs were not those of the intellect , in the narrower sense in which Mr. Buckle uses that term ; the physical science of Paris at that time was an exotic , not a native growth . The only eminent astronomers patronized by Louis XIV . were foreigners ; and France was full half a century behind other nations of Europe in accepting the Newtonian theory . The general result is , that the people of the most splendid civilization made the fewest discoveries ; while with the Germans , English , and Dutch , the case was precisely the reverse . So , also , the richest and most brilliant civilization of Europe , in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries , was that of Rome , Florence , and the other cities of Italy ; and this , again , manifested itself chiefly in literature and art , and hardly at all in scientific inquiry , or the promulgation of new truths . In fact , great achievements in science , like those of Galileo , Newton , Laplace , and Cuvier , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truths on which common mfnds are fed , and by which the broad civilization of a people or an age is affected . They dignify , but they do not constitute , that civilization , nor give rise to it . They remain for a long time , if not forever , like the fruits of the more refined scholarship and the processes // of the higher mathematics , the exclusive property of a comparatively small body of the learned . Art and literature , morality and religion , are far more popular and diffusive in their effects ; they are cosmopolitan and universal , not confined to any country or age , and not by any means limited in their influence to the particular classes by which they are specially professed . They affect the whole atmosphere in which all the people live and act . They color and shape the national life and character in every vein and lineament . Wealth , public spirit , and popular education - both that which is dispensed in schools , and that which is constantly imbibed from the whole environment of institutions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the agencies which foster and diffuse these national blessings . Civilization is not shut up in laboratories , scientific academies , or muse* urns of natural history , and does not issue from them ; on the contrary , the most splendid civilization may exist where these means and appliances of mere physical research are entirely wanting . But it may be said that invention , though not discovery , is a most important agency in the accumulation of wealth , and in bringing about that general enjoyment of the products of the fine and the useful arts , which we have admitted to be one great constituent of civilization . So it is ; but this admission makes iiothing for Mr. Buckle 's purpose , unless he can prove that invention is the natural and ordinary result of discovery . lie here falls into the common error , of which even scientific minds are not yet generally disabused . We altogether deny that either the great inventions which have turned the course of human affairs , or the minor ones which have added so much to our comforts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ranked among the gifts of science , or that they have been made generally by scientific men . As striking instances of the former class , take gunpowder , the mariner s compass , and fhe printing-press ; " for these three , " says Bacon , " have changed the whole face and state of things throughout the world , - the one in literature , another in warfare , and a third in navigation , - whence have followed innumerable changes , insomuch that no empire , no sect , no star , // seems to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs than these mechanical inventions . " But Bacon himself notices the curious fact , that the origin of all three , though recent in his day , is " obscure and inglorious . " In fact , two of them were mere lucky accidents , made we know not positively where or by whom , certainly not by any one of scientific pretensions , as the legend which attributes the invention of gunpowder to Friar Bacon , or another monk , Berthold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a lucky thought which occurred almost simultaneously to two or three rude mechanics . There was nothing to put a person of scientific habits of mind upon the track of either invention , nothing to incite or guide his inquiry . As De Maistre says , the means of making a great discovery generally have no apparent connection with that discovery ; and the illustration which he gives of this remark is furnished by Lord Bacon himself . If Archimedes and a dozen others equally eminent in science had been asked to invent an engine for beating down the ramparts of a city without coming within two or three hundred yards of them , they would have been entirely at fault , or would have thought only of some mode of improving the ancient catapult . But there comes along an obscure monk , who says , " Triturate and mix together sulphur , saltpetre , and charcoal " ; - and the thing is done . So , also , if twenty scientific physicians had been required , a century ago , to invent some means of extirpating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to ask the sovereigns of Europe to cause all their subjects to be inoculated by compulsion . Certainly , nothing short of divination could have sent them to the cows for a solution of the problem . Again , was it science that gave us Peruvian bark , ipecacuanha , mercury , or even sulphuric ether as an ana , sthetic agent ? Or was it rather such experimentation as that of an Indian doctor or conjurer , an African Obiman , or . an English merry-andrew ? The only real question is , whether such discoveries are due to what is called a lucky chance , or to that merciful Providence which , in ways uiiseen by men , often overrules folly and selfishness , by rendering them instruments of good . If we turn to the minor inventions which have aided the // accumulation of wealth and enhanced our material well-being , we still find that we are indebted for most of them either to a fortunate accident , or to the practical skill of some ingenious mechanic , whose school-education , perhaps , barely enabled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine or the process , science usually steps in , and , more or less successfully , explains the nature of the improvement , points out the physical laws that are concerned in it , and often uses it as a guide in its own future investigations . Sometimes it is unable to supply even this poor commentary , and the process continues to be . empirical and inexplicable . Thus the mode of vulcanizing India-rubber , one of vast importance in the arts , offers an insoluble problem to the chemist . He can not tell why heating and rubbing together caoutchouc and sulphur should produce an entirely new substance , - a tertium quid , having other and far more valuable properties than either of its ingredients . So in many of the processes for manufacturing iron , the means have no apparent connection with the end ; the chemist measures the results , but can not tell how or why they are produced . The eminent professors of science who lectured upon the results of the . Great Exhibition in London in 1851 , as we observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uneasy consciousness of the extent of the workman 's knowledge , - almost a doubt whether it was not for the workman to teach them , rather than for them to teach the workman . " Dr. Black , one of the greatest of modern chemists , remarks somewhere in his Lectures , that most of the chemical discoveries which have greatly benefited the arts are due to the manipulations of skilful operatives , rather than to what is called science or chemical philosophy . Many products of the useful arts were obtained by the ancients in as great perfection as by men of our own day ; the article has profited nothing by the experience and the science of two thousand years . One of the lecturers just referred to says , " If Simon , the tanner of Joppa , had been able to send leather to the Exhibition , no doubt he would have carried off a medal . " The iiiventors of the spinning-jenny were a Birmingham * See North American Review for October , 1852 , p. 363. // mechanic , a common laborer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improvements in the steam-engine were made by uneducated mechanics , and they were constantly in advance of the science of their day . The most distinguished among them were Savery , a head miner ; Newcomen , a blacksmith ; Cawley , a glazier ; and llumphr ' *y Potter , an idle little boy . Watt 's modifications of the machine have greater scientific pretensions ; but he was only a half-taught instrument-maker when he contrived them , and many of them have now gone out of use , as practical men have found the engine which was employed before his day to be not only more simple , but more efficient and economical . Fitch , Fulton , and Hulls divide between them the honors of steam navigation , neither of them having any scientific attainments to boast of . But we need not multiply instances , a crowd of which were collected in the article on the Great Exhibition which has just been cited . Mr. Buckle attributes to the progress of knowledge the diminution of " the two greatest e.vils known to mankind , " - religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he affirms , have nursed and exasperated the former , and done nothing towards diminishing the latter ; while the influence of intellectual discoveries has vanquished both . We join issue with him on all these points . Both the evils in question proceed from the passions rather than the judgment . Men need to be calmed and pacified , not to be instructed or argued with , in order to induce them to remain at peace or to tolerate difference of opinion . It is a sentiment rather than a conviction , - an instinctive recoil of our moral and humane feelings , instead of a perception of new truths , - which has stopped the practice of torture , whether inflicted for political or ecclesiastical purposes . The rack and the thumb-screw have gone out of use , because the increased humanity of these later times shuddered at the very sight of them ; and the bitterness of religious disputes has in great measure ceased , because men now think less of the dogmas , and more of the practice , of Christianity . For a century after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry feelings consequent on that great schism raged and were imbittered by // the political changes that grew out of it , and because men were cruel . As the strife cooled , and experience showed the inutility of coercive measures , the voice of humanity and the mild precepts of the Gospel were again heard and respected . Manners were softened , and men ceased to persecute one another under the game impulses and feelings which led them to improve prisons , erect almshouses and hospitals , abolish the slave-trade , and send out missions to the heathen . Mere science , the mere progress of discovery and invention , contributed as little to this result as to the first promulgation of Christianity . It is impossible to see how it should have had any effect on either . As to the practice of war , Mr. Buckle hazarded his assertion of its rapid decline a little too soon . Writing in 1855 , he says : " It is highly characteristic of the actual condition of society , that a peace of unexampled length should have been broken , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between two civilized nations , but by the encroachments of the uncivilized Russians on the still more uncivilized Turks . " This is an ingenious statement of the case , made to conceal the fact , known to all the world , that Turkey was only a nominal partner in the strife , only a pretext for it , and that the real contest was between France and England , two of the most civilized nations on the earth , on the one hand , and Russia on the other , the prize for the victor being the possession of Constantinople . " Russia is a warlike country , " we are told , " not because the inhabitants are immoral , but because they are unintellectual . " But the inhabitants of Russia , taken as a mass , have no more voice or influence in de4ermining between war and peace , than they have in guiding the course of the planets . The sovereign , the nobility , and the higher officers of the army , made the war ; and these are as civilized , as enlightened , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pet phrase , - as any court in Europe . And as to the decline of war , what has been the history of the half-dozen years which have followed what our author calls the forty years of peace , - a peace broken only by a war in Afghanistan , one in Scinde , one in China , one in Mexico , one in Schleswig and Holstein , one in Hungary , two in the // North of Italy , one in Rome , and about half a dozen revolutions , attended with more or less bloodshed , in the most civilized nations of Europe . The last six years have witnessed the Crimean war , the war of the Indian mutiny , a second war in China , the war of France , Sardinia , and Austria in Lombardy , Garibaldi 's war in Sicily , Sardinia 's conquest of Naples and the Roman provinces , and now the fearful civil war which rages in our own unhappy country . And at the present moment , also , France and England are vying with each other in preparations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest is impending in Hungary and Venetia . The decline of war ! Search the annals of the world , and we doubt if a period of equal length can be found which has witnessed so terrible an outbreak of the warlike spirit as that which has characterized the last fifteen years . Terrible as the contest was which was terminated by the treaties of Vienna in 1815 , it was , in the main , a struggle of all Europe against one man . Mr. Buckle attributes his fancied decay of the desire for war to the march of intellect generally , but specially to the invention of gunpowder , the *discoveries made by political ecoiAmy , and the improved means of locomotion . Now , gunpowder came into general use about four centuries ago , and during this time it may well be doubted if there have been fe.wer wars , or less bloodshed , than in the four centuries immediately preceding . Economical science has not discovered a single truth which tends to increase the desire for peace ; it has merely furnished some additional illustrations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations fought from motives of interest , and not from considerations of honor , jealousy , anger , revenge , and other turbulent passions . No further proof was needed that war is always a costly , often a ruinous , expedient . The quarrels of nations , like those of individuals , grow out of their ill-regulated passions ; and these can be checked and restrained , not by considerations addressed to the intellect , but , if at all , by the teachings of morality and religion . These last have greatly humanized war ; they have amelior*ed the fate of captives , forbidden the use of poison and other savage expedients , protected the property and lives of non-combatants on land , and 47 * // are on the point of putting an end to privateering , which is only another name for piracy , at sea . And this is all that is possible , until mankind have become , not wiser , but better . Never was a war more obviously and ruinously destructive of all public and private interests thanthat into which the Southern States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the madness of Secession by considerations drawn from political economy or constitutional law is like preaching to a tornado . The tempest must blow itself out . Only when the wind has lulled can the voice of reason or the whispers of conscience be heard . But the rambling and desultory character of Mr. Buckle 's work has protracted the task of following him , and our remarks are already extended to undue length , before a tithe of his errors and fallacies have been exposed and refuted . We have dwelt mainly upon the principles on which his History is based , as an attempt to trace their application in detail would far exceed our limits . And yet the absurdity of the conclusions to which he is led furnishes , perhaps , the best proof of the erroneousness of his method and the falsity of his premises . The whole of his second volume is devoted to an *aborate examination of the history of Spain and of Scotland , in the hop&amp; of proving that superstition is always rife where volcanoes and earthquakes are common , - that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startling phenomena of nature , and that it can never be exposed and put down by the employment of the deductive method of reasoning . This is rather a meagre result of an inquiry extending so far , and conducted with so much pretension . And , as a doctrine , it is simply ludicrous . Never did a poor pedant , bitten with the love of theoriziiig , ride so far afield , in order to bring home a paltry and absurd conclusion . We should almost suspect the sanity of one who seriously entertained it . If it were true , the inhabitants of Iceland , a country surpassing every other on the globe in the grandeur and striking character of its physical phenomena , made inaccessible by enormous ice-fields for most of the year , often shak*fi by terrible earthquakes , mailed in sheets of lava and studded with active volcanoes , ought to be the most superstitious race on earth . Unfortunately for Mr. // Buckle 's theory , they happen to be a peculiarly sober , industrious , intellectual , well-educated , Christian people , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-scorched plains of ilindostan , where nature offers only a wearisome monotony to the beholder . Again , Scotland is troubled neither by earthquakes nor volcanoes . True , it has mists , and mountains , and severe winters , in which Mr. Buckle 's theory , faute de mieux , takes refuge ; but its near neighbor , Norway , has precisely the same characteristics , and the Norwegians are not peculiarly superstitious . Then the elaborate attempt to prove that science in Scotland has made an excessive use of the deductive method is an utter failure . Adam Smith has not made half as much use of this kind of reasoning as Maithus and Ricardo ; indeed , it is chiefly owing to the latter , an English Jew , that English political economy has become a deductive science . As a speculatist , Hume makes more use of facts and less of abstract reasoning than Hobbes ; the latter is a system-maker , and the former a destroyer of system . Leslie , as a writer on heat , relies much more on experimentation and induction than Fourier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Davy , Dr. Black must be regarded as eminently an inductive philosopher . But enough of details , in which the task of exposing Mr. Buckle 's blunders would be endless . We have spoken with freedom and severity of his work , because its tone and tendency are bad . With considerable merits of literary execution , it is characterized in a remarkable degree by arrogant pretensions , a dogmatic spirit , coarseness of expression , and a contemptuous disregard of the feelings and opinions which a vast majority of the author 's countrymen hold sacred . Under the guise of a history , its only aim is to teach the preconceived conclusions of a false and debasing philosophy . If these conclusions were sound , man would be an animated machine , not accountable for his actions , and without either hopes or fears extending beyond this brief sphere of earthly existence . Rashness of assertion and inconsequence of reasoning are what we expected to find in the state&amp;ent and defence of such doctrines ; and in this expectation we have not been disappointed .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
