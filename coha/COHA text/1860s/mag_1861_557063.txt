113 CHARLES ROBERT LESLIE . ART . V. - 1 . Autobiographical Recollections . By the late CHARLES ROBERT LESLIE , R. A. Edited , with a Prefatory Essay on Leslie as an Artist , and Selections from his Correspondence , by TOM TAYLOR , ESQ. , Editor of the Autobiography of ilaydon . With portrait . Boston : Ticknor and Fields . 1860. 2 . Jiliemoirs of the Life of Jo/in Constable , Esq. , II . A. By CHARLES II . LESLIE . London . 1845. 3 . A Hand-Boo/c for Young Artists . By C. R. LESLIE . London . 1855 . THROUGH his various writings Leslie has become associated with the world of letters , as well as of art . It is very possible that his name will be even more widely known by means of his pen than of his pencil ; for works of art , unless very popular in their subject , and reproduced by copy or engraving , are to be seen only in those few collections which are so fortunate as to possess them ; whereas books , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , circulating freely among all classes , and becoming familiarly known , even through widely separated nations . The costliness of an elaborate work of art places it beyond the reach of the multitude , but books can become the possession of all . Thus , while there may not be more than ten or twelve of Leslie 's paintings in America , his writings will be welcomed at thousands of firesides . Probably every artist in the land will read what he has written , and very many who are not artists will derive from his pages instruction and pleasure . Before the invention of printin* when each sentence , letter by letter , was slowly produced on parchment , so great was the value of a book that few could be purchasers ; and , as was natural under these circumstances , few could read . At such a period , paintings and frescos constituted the wider medium of communication , and a work of art diffused more extensively than books the lessons of history or of religion . What a marvellous change , now that the illustrated page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly a member of which could be found without taste to appreciate and capacity to understand ! 10 * // Thus the artist who can embody his idea in writing , as well as upon canvas , must exert an extended influence . There is a natural affinity between art and literature , and the same mind may express its best thoughts through both . Some of the sonnets of Michel Angelo are as remarkable as the marble that burst into life beneath his chisel . Leonardo da Vinci , among his many gifts , was profoundly conversant with science and philosophy , and proved himself , in several departments of thought , an accomplished writer . Sir Joshua Reynolds did perhaps as much , even for the advancement of art , by his lectures as by his masterly portraits ; and , in our own country , Washington Allston , both in poetry and prose , has left that which is stamped by the peculiar impress of his genius . Many artists are undoubtedly wise in devoting their energies exclusively to the special branch for which they feel best qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to their other achievements , can , through their writings , reach the public mind , they must thereby stand upon higher vantage-ground ; and , in proportion to their ability , will gain the respect of mankind . Leslie 's writings are such as crown his memory with merited honor . They are characterized throughout by unexaggerated truthfulness , a genial and healthy tone , and an elevated spirit . There is in them no striving for extraordinary brilliancy ; no blaze of epithet ; no eccentricity or morbid egotism ; no jealousy or bitterness ; no foolish extravagance of censure or of praise . They indicate , throughout , sober discrimination and sound sense ; yet there is no lack of true enthusiasm , insight , and power . They have , moreover , a colloquial ease and pleasantry reminding one at times of Addison and Irving . They unite a rare felicity of expression with purity of taste and manly independence . The same characteristics which marked Leslie socially as a man are perceptible in all that he has written , He has a plain straightforwardness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth a feeling of confidence and friendship . Leslie 's " Memoir of Constable " is a model of that class of writing , - lucid in style , unaffected , simple , and graphic . It is the lifelike portraiture of a beautiful character ; the // history of a mind that loved nature , and was ever in harmony with her best influences . No one can read the work without acquiring a deep interest both in the writer and in the subject . It is easy to perceive that there was a kindred spirit between Leslie and Constable ; it is pleasant to follow them in their common tastes , to observe the attachment which bound them to each other , and the manner in which they helped to mould and modify each other 's judgments . Leslie is at no pains to conceal his admiration for his friend ; yet lie never obtrudes his praise ; but , by the pleasant recital of facts and conversations , with selections from letters and journals , he brings us naturally into the circle of sympathy , until we feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same elevated tastes . We confess that this memoir has for us the interest of a romance . Indeed , the power it possesses is greater than could be conceded to a meme work of fiction . The reality of all wins upon the heart , till the experiences of joy and trial portrayed actually seem our own , and the noble perseverance and loyalty to duty awaken feelings approaching to veneration . Through good report and through evil report Constable adhered to what he considered correct principle in art . He willingly sacrificed immediate popularity to his convictions ; and when we perceive , in the midst of opposition and ridicule , the untiring devotion with which , in his pursuit of art , lie studied the works of God , his course has an element of grandeur . The great error among artists of that day was an unwillingness to represent nature truthfully . In opposition to this , Constable sought to delineate nature as she actually appeared , with the fresh breeze and sparkling dewdrop . An artificial taste prevailed ; Constable determined to break from the thraldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , when at times it required some courage to do so , the most cordial approval and support . Whether Constable always succeeded in realizing upon canvas his own idea or not , no one can withhold from Leslie the credit of a worthy independence in his manly sympathy with his friend , and in his adherence to Constable , both within the Royal Academy and out of it , when so many were opposed to him . Under the circumstances , it displayed a genuine nobleness // of character . As a tribute to the truthfulness of Constable 's pictures , Fuseli , on seeing his representation of an approaching shower , called to his servant to bring him his coat and umbrella ; while another declared that he could feel the wind blowing on his face . It is a curious fact , that while the artists of England were slow to recognize the merit of Constable , the artists of France no sooner became acquainted with his style than they burst into a blaze of enthusiasm , his works in that country producing an actual revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of feeling , depicting nature with lifelike freshness . He delighted in the most familiar objects . An old mill , a running stream , a meadow , a cottage-door , a village church , - these were the favorite themes of his pencil . Not the Yale of Tempe , with Juno or Jupiter , but some rural nook nearer home , with personages such as are oftener seen in the walks of daily life ; the corn-field , with the simple ploughboy ; the river , with its ford or ferry ; the neighboring hill-side , with bending grass and flitting shadows , along which the laboring peasant is seen returning to his home , - such were the subjects dear to his heart , and which it was his chief joy to portray . We can imagine Leslie and Constable together , studying with poetic fervor the open volume of nature , and , with a genius kindred to that of Wordsworth , detecting the truest beauty and the grandest thought in the most familiar objects . Sir Richard Steele , ( or shall we simply call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author who determined to write " in a way perfectly new , by describing things exactly as they happened . " Constable resolved to act upon the same principle in painting ; - not to manufacture pictures at secondhand ; not to rest in any feeble mimicry of the old masters ; but to go directly to nature , transferring thence the very life and motion of things . Nature he loved with a constant affection . At times he would sit through the whole day watching every minute change in light and shade , in cloud and atmosphere , remaining often so still that the field-mice have been known to creep into his pocket . In this love of nature Leslie and Constable were in perfect sympathy , and it was Constable 's truth to nature that Leslie specially admired . " Among all the // landscape painters , " he writes , " ancient or modern , no one carries me so entirely to nature ; and I can truly say , that since I have known his works , I have never looked at a tree or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment which existed between these brother-artists was honorable alike to both ; and in Leslie* s memoir of his friend , while he has raised a fitting monument to the character and genius of one whom he truly loved , he has unconsciously left , by the same act , an impressive proof of his own excellence . In the " Hand-Book for Young Painters , " we have what was first given in lectures , recast in a form appropriate to wider use . As lectures , they were delivered before the Royal Academy , in 1850 , and were the earliest given at the Academy which were honored by the presence of ladies . Their clearness of statement , beauty of illustration , and force of argument amply sustained the reputation of their author , and gained for them a wide-spread popular reception . They are full of valuable suggestions . The writer , purposely avoiding the ostentatious use of technical terms , addresses himself at once to the common understanding , giving , with great transparency of diction , the result of much personal experience and close observation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sir Joshua Reynolds , and at times from Ruskin ; but , while true to his conviction , he never dogmatizes . His opinions are given with frankiiess , and the reader is then left to form his own judgment . There is no sweeping denunciation or scathing satire ; but through every page there breathes a genial appreciation and generous candor . The discourse rises or falls with the natural feelings of the writer , who prefers to state his view with simplicity , and let it rest upon its own merit , rather than to attempt to dazzle by any false glare of rhetoric . This work is filled with able criticisms , and pervaded by a fresh and genuine spirit . In the Autobiography of Leslie we have reminiscences of his own life , interwoven with recollections and anecdotes of the most eminent men of his time , with many of whom he was intimate . Leslie 's parents were natives of Maryland . His maternal ancestors were from England , his paternal from Scotland . // His father , at the head of a mercantile house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London when Leslie was born , October 19 , 1794 . There they remained until his fifth year , when , in 1799 , they returned to America . They sailed in an East-Indiaman , and were exposed to unusual danger , from the war then existing between the United States and France . Having passed the English fleet from the Mediterranean , they soon fell in with a French ship , with which they became involved in a severe engagement . Of this sea-fight Leslie always retained a vivid remembrance . So serious were the damages received by their vessel , that they were obliged to make for Lisbon , five hundred miles distant , where they were detained five months , and put to an expense of ? 10,000 sterling . After leaving Lisbon they encountered severe gales , and at length arrived at Philadelphia on the 11th of May , seven months and twenty-six days from London . His father died in 1804 , leaving the family in rather straitened circumstances . At this time Leslie was pursuing his studies at the University of Pennsylvania . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , lacking the means to educate him ' as an artist , in 1808 apprenticed him to Messrs . Bradford and Juskeep , booksellers , with whom he remained three years , when a likeness which he hastily sketched of Cooke , an English actor , then popular in Philadelphia , attracted attention . Such was the skill which this drawing displayed , that many encouraged him to devote himself to art . Funds were liberally contributed by private individuals to give him the opportunity of visiting England , that he might gain every advantage which could there be found . While a lad in Philadelphia he had looked with admiration upon the pictures in Peale 's Museum , and he states that the windows of the print-shops were so many Academies to him . Thus did his natural tendencies show themselves , and they received in this country the first impulse in that profession in which he was afterward to become so honorably distinguished . While he was in Philadelphia , Sully gave him a few lessons in oil-painting , and furnished him , when he embarked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beechey , and other artists . He arrived at Liverpool on the 3d of December , 1811 , and was soon in London , of which he had " a kind of dreamy remembrance . " // In Mr. Bradford 's shop he had become acquainted with the most interesting books from the English press ; and , through engravings , he knew the characteristic styles of the principal English artists . West 's great picture of " King Lear in the Storm , " he had seen in Philadelphia , and now he was to receive instructions from the artist , at that time President of the Royal Academy . Leslie - a boy of sixteen - entered with youthful enthusiasm upon the enjoyments and privileges which now opened before him . He was soon established in rooms in Fitzroy Square , had visited the various galleries , formed a pleasant acquaintance with West , and numbered among his friends Mr. Morse and Washington Allston . Morse was about his own age , and Allston some fifteen years his senior . The name of Morse has since become associated with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and persevering industry , was introduced to the world , he having had the honor of establishing in this country , as a practical working power , the first line known to exist ; since which , lines have been extended , till now they may be said to encompass the globe . During their early artist-life in London , Leslie and Morse occupied the same room , Morse painting at one window and Leslie at the other . In the dramatic world , Mrs. Siddons and John Kemble were at the acme of their popularity , and , together with Liston , Munden , and Matthews , were making Drury Lane and Covent Garden scenes of unprecedented excitement . Is it not probable that these wonderful representations had their effect in the works which in after life , through his pencil , found their " way upon canvas** ? " Henry * " The Merry Wives of Windsor , " " Twelfth Night , " " The Winter 's Tale , " have all become associated with his masterly delineations . Leslie 's earliest instructors in painting were Sully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is interesting to remember , were Americans . The latter , he tells us , was the first to awaken his perceptions to the beauties of color , especially as displayed in the marvellous productions of Titian , Paul Veronese , and the masters of the Venetian School . He soon became acquainted with Fuseli , and was studying the Townley Marbles at the British Museum , and the Elgin Marbles at Burlington // House . Thus did Morse and Leslie at that time employ their summer mornings . During the second year of Leslie* s resideuce in London , Aliston 's health so far failed that he was obliged to leave London for Bristol . Leslie accompanied his friend , aud while upon the journey Aliston became too ill to proceed . As a proof of the devoted affection which existed between Coleridge and Allston , the moment that Coleridge heard of Aliston 's illness , he came to the town where they were , and remained until Aliston was able to proceed . The house being crowded , Coleridge shared the same room with Leslie . On the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History of New York , " then just published , Coleridge became so deeply interested that he passed nearly the whole night in reading it , giving frequent expression to his delight . From this time Leslie continued on terms of friendship with Coleridge , often visiting him at Highgate . In a note which Coleridge wrote , after Allston had returned to America , he says : " Why , my dear Leslie , do you so wholly desert us at Highgate ? Are we not always delighted to see you ? Now , too , more than ever , since , in addition to yourself , you are all we have of Allston . " Leslie was impressed , as so many others have been , with the extraordinary colloquial powers of that remarkable man . The musical intonations of his voice , the vast resources of his mind , the richness and unending variety of his illustrations , and the spontaneous eloquence with which he expressed himself , threw an irresistible charm over nearly every listener . Leslie heard , both at Clifton and in London , several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he states that he gained more satisfactory views respecting poetry and painting than he had acquired from any other source . Various pleasing reminiscences are related both of Coleridge and of Charles Lamb . IDuring 1816 Leslie was a student in the Antique Academy , at that time under the superintendence of Faseli . This eccentric man generally entered the room in which the students were assembled with a book in his hand , engrossed in reading , the students , meanwhile , pursuing their work according to their inclination , - a course which Leslie , on the whole , considered wise : saying that " Art is to be learnt , not taught , " // and that under Fuseli 's " wise neglect " such men as Wilkie , Etty , Landseer , and Haydon distinguished themselves . After the students had worked , in their own way for a time , Fuseli examined their drawings , correcting them with his left band , and often making remarks such as could never be forgotten . Notwithstanding his occasional violence of temper he was very popular with students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rendered him a general favorite . Fortunately Leslie knew what to avoid , as well as what to seek . Hence the wild spirit of Fuseli , which was at times lawless in its daring , spurning indignantly the simpler realities of life , did not exert an injurious influence upon his mind . Leslie , however much he might appreciate what was good in the qualities of another , never parted with his own sound sense . In speaking , at that time , of a picture by Fuseli , he says : " It is one of the most tremendous exhibitions of appalling sights I ever beheld . The figures glare across the picture like a horrible dream . He has certainly never been equalled in the visionary , and there it is he shines as a genius ; but whenever he attempts commonplace he is contemptible . " Leslie obtained two silver medals while at the Academy . Edwin Landseer was a fellow-student with Leslie , - " a pretty , curly-headed boy . " He attracted attention by his talent , and Fuseli , looking round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leslie 's first large picture- " Saul and the Witch of Endor " - was purchased by Sir John Leicester , for one hundred guineas . In 1816 he commenced in a style and upon a class of subjects which became more and more congenial to his tastes . He had until now principally confined himself to the antique ; from this period he entered upon the illustration of scenes from Shakespeare , Addison , Fielding , Smollett , and Goldsmith . Many of the characters of Cervantes , Le Sage , and Moli*re are also identified with Leslie 's pencil . his earliest picture in this department was " The Murder of Plantagenet by Clifford , " and he tells us that Sir Edwin Landseer ( the " curly-headed youngster " ) sat for the pleading boy , with a rope round his wrists . While the great controversy was going on respecting the // Elgin marbles , in which Haydon took a prominent part , Leslie showed his usual discrimination . He writes to Philadelphia , - the city to which he looked with strong affection , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ antiques in the world , just brought from Athens by Lord Elgin . " It will be an incalculable advantage to our artists , and their being in Philadelphia would make me quite content to fix my residence there for the remainder of my life . " " Tell Sully , " he adds , " that I entreat him not to lose a moment 's time in persuading the Academy to procure them . He will look upon their arrival as a sure prognostic of the rise of arts among us . " Of late the merits of Turner have been o often and so ably discussed , and Mr. Ruskin , in his successive volumes of the " Modern Painters , " has written so eloquently , that it is pleasant to look back forty or fifty years , and see what is said by a young man , fresh from this side of the Atlantic , and without any previous elaborate criticisms from others to aid him . In a letter dated December , 1816 , Leslie , after alluding to other artists , writes as follows - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the painters here . I went to see his pictures yesterday , and was delighted , as I always am , with them . He combines the highest poetical imagination with an exquisite feeling for all the truth and individuality of nature , and he has shown that the ideal , as it is called , is not the improving of nature , but the selecting and combining objects that are most in harmony and character with each other . " In 1817 , Leslie , in company with Allston , visited Paris ; and thence , with Stuart Newton , went to Brussels and Antwerp . In a letter from Paris he writes - " The following day we went to the Louvre , and revelled all the morning in the richest luxury of art . It is impossible for me to describe my feelings . Had my whole life before been one of misery , it seemed as if this day would have balanced the account , and made me consider myself the happiest of human beings . " We find Leslie during this year corresponding with Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Knickerbocker , " and " The Sketch-Book . " " I have put the sketch of the Dutch Courtship , " he writes , " into the // hands of a very excellent engraver . " A short time previous to this , Irving had been associated with his brothers in a mercantile house ; but financial troubles soon changed his plans , and he had resolved upon a course in accordance with his natural tastes , and was now devoting himself to literature . Indeed , he was just then embarking upon literary efforts which proved a series of successes and triumphs , reflecting honor alike upon himself and his country . " The SketchBook " was published in numbers , and Irving writes to Leslie - " The sale is very rapid , and altogether the success exceeds my most sanguine expectations . Now , you suppose I am all on the alert , and full of spirit and excitement . No such thing . I am just as good for nothing as ever I was , and , indeed , have been flurried and put out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I suppose you did when your picture met with success , - anxious to do something better , and at a loss what to do . " At another time he writes - " I trust that you and Newton have a long career of increasing success and popularity before you . Of my own fate I sometimes feel a doubt . I am isolated in English literature , without any of the usual aids and influences by which an author 's popularity is maintained and promoted . I have no literary coterie to cry me up ; no partial reviewer to pat me on the back : the very Review of my publisher is hostile to everything American . I have nothing to depend on but the justice and courtesy of the public ; and how long the public may continue to favor the writings of a stranger , or how soon it may be prejudiced by the scribblers of the press , is with me a matter of extreme uncertainty . I have one proud reflection , however , to sustain myself with : that I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the censures of reviewers , but have left my works to rise or fall by their own deserts I long to hear from you . How often do I miss you , in moments when I feel cast down and out of heart , and how often at times when some of the odd scenes of life present themselves which we used to enjoy so heartily together ! " Washington Aliston was on terms of intimate friendship with Irving at the time of those financial troubles which swept away his property . We have often listened to Allston , on pleasant evenings , at his fireside , as he dwelt upon the noble spirit Irving displayed at that severe crisis of his life . At // the moment when everything had been sacrificed , Irving exclaimed , " Well , now I have not got a groat in the world ; and I never was happier in my life . " About this time Irving seriously thought of becoming a painter , and Aliston encouraged him in the idea , and in their rambles together through picturesque regions they planned schemes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Irving was destined to give to the world were those graphic descriptions on the written page , which can never grow dim with time . A large edition of " The Sketch-Book " was soon published by Murray , the success of which was so great that a thousand guineas were offered for his next work , fifteen hundred guineas for the " Tales of a Traveller , " in 1824 , and three thousand guineas for the " Life of Columbus " ; besides which he received a fifty-guinea gold medal by direction of George IV. , and an honorary degree from the University of Oxford . With such signal success , and the honors that ever after spontaneously followed him , it is pleasant to see the beautiful simplicity of his heart , and the manner in which some of his most popular writings had their origin . Toward the close of 1821 , Leslie made a delightful excursion with Irving into Derbyshire . They journeyed , chatting together , on the top of a coach , to Oxford . On the day following there was a heavy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stout Gentleman . " After this they visited Stratfordon-Avon , Warwick , and Kenilworth . At intervals Irving continued busy with his pencil , while Leslie was making sketches . Irving , seated on a stile , or on some stone by the road-side , still proceeded with his writing , every now and then laughing to himself , - and at times reading aloud to Leslie that they might enjoy what had been written together . The inimitable picture of the inn-yard on a rainy day was an exact account of their experience at Derby . As an illustration of the sympathetic character of Irving 's nature , and his affection for Leslie , we take the following extract from a letter , dated at Paris : - " My dear boy , it is a grievous thing to be separated from you , and I feel it more and more . I wish to heaven this world were not so wide , and that we could manage to keep more together in it . This continual // separating from those we like is one of the curses of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I can not get accustomed to it . " In another letter , he writes : - " I often look back with fondness and regret on the times when we lived together in London , in a delightful community of thought and feeling , struggling our way onward in the world , but cheering and encouraging each other . I find nothing to supply the place of that heartfelt fellowship . " One of the pleasant facts in Leslie 's life is his long-continued and unbroken friendship with Irving . This intimacy was alike honorable to both , and their correspondence , running through many years , has a charming freshness . In 1821 Leslie was elected an associate of the Royal Academy . This naturally brought him into greater intimacy with the most distinguished artists of the time . With such men as Wilkie , Stothard , Flaxman , Chantrey , Turner , and Lawrence , he now mingled on terms of pleasant friendship ; and Leslie , with his social temperament and appreciative spirit , was particularly calculated to enjoy such intercourse , and to improve by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no petty jealousy , he rejoiced in the popularity of those who were successful ; while he was willing to perceive , and glad to honor , the ability which many had not the sagacity to detect . Leslie was now fairly on his way to fame and fortune . His works were widely appreciated , and his society was valued and sought . Sir Walter Scott called to study his pictures while in progress . Leslie 's pictures , so peculiarly his own , awakened general interest . His " May-Day in the Time of Queen Elizabeth , " with its portrayal of rustic manners and joyous merriment , was , a picture that Scott greatly relished ; and very many less eminent than Scott relished it also . Another bright and sunny picture , full of life and character , representing the good old English times , was " Sir Roger de Coverley going to Church . " These universal favorites were soon followed by " Sancho Pauza in the Apartment of the Duchess . " West , Wilkie , Constable , and the best artists of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Earl of Essex , the Duke of Bedford , and a host of others , were anxious for new pictures , and , what was more , were willing to pay for 11* // them most generous prices . Thus Leslie might well be considered a fortunate man . He had the satisfaction ( which all artists have not ) of seeing his works at once appreciated , of being met with universal kindness , and of receiving , without the slightest personal solicitation , ample encouragement. * In 1824 he visited Abbotsford , in order to paint a portrait of Sir Walter Scott , for Professor Ticknor of Boston . Of this visit the volume before us gives an interesting account . In 1825 he became united by marriage to one who , through later years , proved a sympathizing companion and a devoted wife . Their domestic life was unclouded , continuing to the end peculiarly peaceful and pleasant . The only thing to break the even tenor of his days , was his being appointed Teacher of Drawing at the Military Academy at West Point , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and on account of which , during that year , he visited America . But Leslie 's expectations in connection with this position were not realized , and in 1834 he returned to England . In twenty days after leaving New York , with unfeigned joy he landed in England ; from which time , through a period of five and twenty years in that country of his adoption , he was surrounded by success and happiness . " I have known people , " he in one place writes , " who I fancied would not be quite satisfied with heaven itself , if they should ever come there . " Leslie was not of this class . He had no desire to turn exclusively to the dark side , to dwell upon faults and foibles , or to waste life in unreasonable complaints . It was this disposition , which , added to his fine tastes and agreeable manners , made him a delightful companion . He threw sunshine over the path of others , and he enjoyed the sunshine himself . The delineation he gives us of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is most graphic . An eye like his * Lord E remont voluntarily offered Leslie a thousand pounds for a companion picture to " Sancho and the Duchess , " to which Leslie replied , that he could not feel justified in taking more than half that sum ; and when , after the death of the poet Rogers , his paintings were sold at auction , one by Leslie brought eleven hundred and fifty guineas . A country dealer , not knowing Leslie , exclaimed , " Good gracious me eleven hundred and fifty guineas for one of Leslie 's pictures ! Did you ever hear such a price , sir l " " Monstrous , is it not 3 " said Leslie , who afterward told the story with great glee . // could see quickly enough the failings of men . With his keen sense of the ludicrous , and his deep love of humor , few weaknesses or follies could escape his observation ; but these were not the things upon which he loved to expatiate . He believed that friends were given for a better use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If , therefore , there is nothing which can be said kindly , he says nothing ; but as it happens , ( fortunately for us , as well as for himself , ) there is much which he could write , and which all can read , with unmingled satisfaction . Yet he deals not in fulsome panegyric . Far from it ; he shows habitual discrimination . Every character upon which he dwells is both natural and individual . Through his lifelike descriptions , his friei*ds become our friends . We feel that we know Constable , with his purity of taste , and firm , yet gentle nature ; Fuseli , with his impetuosity , shrewdness , and wit ; Flaxman , kind and scrupulously polite ; Wilkie , modest and cautious , always deliberate , never impulsive , apparently grave , yet with sparkling humor ; Haydon , with his egotism and dogmatism , alternately attracting and repelling ; Edwin Landseer , the true gentleman , yet best of mimics , - he who can throw such pathos , vivacity , mirthfulness , over the animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mirthful himself . Here , too , we admire Stothard , preserving a cheerful spirit through a life of many sorrows ; we become acquainted with Northcote , whose sharp eye was typical of his sharper tongue ; we are amused by Chantrey , with his John Bull bluffness , yet pleasant and playful ; and are astonished at the amazing genius of Turner , with his varied power and untiring industry , - shy in manner , yet , withal , frank and genial . On those varnishing and painting days at the Academy , when the artists dined together , Turner was the life of the table ; with voice deep and musical , no one was more joyous ; a recluse at times , yet truly social in his nature . So , also , we occasionally accompany Leslie on some of his pleasant rounds . Now we go to the well-known mansion of Samuel IRogers , with its splendid attractions , where we listen to the wise discourse of Sir James Mackintosh , and the brilliant repartee of Sydney Smith . We hear Tom Moore half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siddons relate , with startling // effect , some dramatic reminiscence ; or Rogers himself tell a story with the same exquisite finish with which he would write a lyric . Or we breakfast with Sir Walter Scott , where we meet Irving and the poet Crabbe . We hear , perhaps , the Great Magician speak of the hunters who chase wild deer along the braes of Athol , or describe some wild pass in the Highlands , made famous by heroic deeds ; or we find ourselves in the grand old library of Holland House , while Lord Holland converses upon Horace Walpole and Charles Fox , or amuses those who will listen with recollections of Boswell ; or we are transported to Petworth , where we pass a week with Lord Egremont , and , in partaking of his generous hospitality , see how a nobleman can be doubly noble , and show munificence without ostentation ; or we step into Somerset House , and attend a meeting of the Academy , Sir Thomas Lawrence presiding ; or we stroll from London to Coombs Wood , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass with Constable and Stothard , and watch the sunbeams as they tremble in the foliage . Thus we make pleasant acquaintance with most agreeable people ; we listen to amusing anecdotes ; we hear now and then weighty remarks ; and have imparted to us , in confidence , as little gossip as could possibly be expected , - * - -   indeed , so little that we rather wish for more . It is plain that nothing has been set down in malice . In fact , we have enjoyed our visits so much , that we should not object to their repetition , and we congratulate ourselves that we have made such friendships . And this reminds us , just now , of one whom we can not but mention , - Peter Powell , - to whom we are introduced in these pages . " That merry , amusing , light-hearted , discontented little radical , " we do hope we shall meet again . Before closing these remarks , it may naturally be asked what was Leslie 's rank as a painter . There is , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the kingliest spirits out of the passing ages have been admitted . Michel Angelo , Raphael , and Leonardo da Vinci there sit supreme . As in literature , Shakespeare and Milton , Dante and Tasso , Homer and Virgil , find no one to dispute or divide their sovereignty ; so in art , there are unapproachable elevations // to which but a few of the most daring spirits have climbed , and these not altogether by strength of their own , but by those pre-eminent powers with which they had been marvellously endowed . Who can account for Shakespeare ? or who believe that , by any process of culture , another like him can be produced ? Such beings are not made , but sent ; and they have a mission of their own . No exaltation so great is claimed for Leslie , - least of all would he claim it for himself . He had a just estimate of his own capacity . The same good sense which he displayed in everything else characterized him here . He did not exaggerate his ability , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a certain province which he could fill , and that province he did fill , well and honorably . This was his wisdom . He did not spend his days in vainly striving to do what Nature and Providence never intended he should do . He studied his own gifts , and sought to make the best use of them ; and in doing this , he achieved a good work , and gained his reward . Not to those lofty triumphs of idoal art which kindle within the soul the fire of devotion , d*d he chiefly turn his mind . Nor did he satisfy himself with feebly attempting to copy what he could not originate , by imitating at a long distance those heaven-directed masters who lift the mind into holy aspiration , and whose great works are so instinct with worship that they find their fitting place by the sacred altar , and in the temple of God . To a less elevated , but still to a noble sphere , he felt called . His mission was not so much to awaken directly high spiritual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and to give to cultivated tastes an added intellectual gratification ; and , to his honor be it said , in all he did there was an absolute purity of sentiment , without the slightest admixture of coarseness . In the mechanical execution of his work he slighted no detail . In coloring , perspective , and composition there was rare excellence . The accessories were harmonious , the grouping skilful , and the unity of idea complete . You could walk into his distances , and inhale the atmosphere in which they were bathed . He loved the good old English times , and the happy scenes of that day he rejoiced to bring back again through his magical art . But he did not dwell upon exter // nals alone . He had a delicate feeling for nature , a constant perception of grace , and a keen love of humor . He painted mind , as well as costume . His norms were more than shapes , they were alive with soul . In them you saw the nicest delineation of character , the finest shades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first tremulous budding of emotion . Every picture told its story . Each person was an essential part , and the most hidden motive was seen , while over all was the impress of reality , the fulness of life , the inspiration of truth . Still , it must be admitted that his works were in some respects more the result of memory than of imagination . He did not so much actually originate what he represented , as illustrate the creation of others . His was rather a perceptive than a creative genius . He was an interpreter between the author and the world . Addison , Cervantes , Shakespeare , brought thought , feeling , wit , love , into being ; Leslie gave to those aerial conceptions of their minds color and form . If he called spirits from the vasty deep , they might not always come at bjs bidding ; but when with Shakespearian power they were called up , he had the eye to perceive their mysterious beauty , and the most subtile workings of their inmost natures were revealed to him , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their forms , even their minutest expression , visible to others . To him they were not imaginary , but real beings . Certainly Falstaff and Don Quixote actually sat for their portraits . Most obligingly Uncle Toby twice came , with his usual goodnature , in his buff waistcoat , looking just as he did when he had that dangerous t*te-d-t*te with the Widow Wadman in the sentrybox . Here also truly are Robin Hood , and Maid Marian , and Littlejohn , and Friar Tuck . Nay , we actually look in upon Master Slender 's courtship , and have a fellow-feeling for him as he sheepishly stands with his hat in his hand ; or we behold Lady Jane Grey , as she was seen by Roger Ascham in the oriel window , meditating upon the open page of Plato . There she stands , lost in delight over Ph*do Platonis , while the Duke and Duchess and all the gentlewomen are hunting in the Park , and smilingly she says , " I wist , all their sport is but a shadow to that pleasure which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see the queenly figure of Victoria , or Anne Boleyn , or the lovely Beatrice . // Leslie acquired a European , nay , we may affirm , a worldwide celebrity ; and it is saying much when we add that he did so without pandering to a single unworthy taste or feeling . There is a pure and elevated tone in all that he did . If his aim was to confer pleasure , it was innocent pleasure . He showed how much of real interest may be connected with common objects , what a charm may be associated with domestic li e , how literature may be illustrated and enriched by art , and how the customs of a past day may be brought before the vision for present instruction and enjoyment . Mr. Taylor , the editor of the first-mentioned work before us , has performed his labor most successfully . His former work of this kind was the Autobiography of ilaydon . A more complete contrast it would be difficult to imagine . Taylor himself dwells upon it with great truthfulness . " Haydon , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-confidence , passion , and combativeness . He was exclusive in his theories ; reckless in his defiance of difficulties ; unscrupulous in the means he took to relieve them ; untiring in his appeals to patrons , and public men , and the public . Regarding himself as a martyr to high art , he claimed to the full all the immunities and indulgences that the most lenient and sympathetic judgment could attach to that position . Alternately elated with the most buoyant hope , and depressed by the deepest despair " Jn Leslie , on the other hand , we see the man of cautious , trustful , respectful nature from the first . Slow in the formation of his judgment , disposed to defer to others in his art and out of it , but strong in principle , and apt to hold stubbornly to convictions once grasped ; not given to court notoriety or publicity , and rather shrinking from than provoking conflict ; asking only leave to pursue the even tenor of his way in the practice of the unambitious art he loved , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of reserve and reticence ; valuing good taste and moderation as much in art as in manners ; averse to exclusive theories , or loud-sounding selfassertion in all its forms ; closing a happy , peaceful , successful , and honored life by the calm and courageous death of a Christian , and leaving behind him pictures stamped in every line with good taste , chastened humor , and graceful sentiment , - pictures which it makes us happier , gentler , and better to look upon , - pictures which help us to love good books more , and to regard our fellow-creatures with kindlier eyes . " // In another place he writes - " How genuine all these qualities were in Leslie , is best shown by his life and by his character , as indicated in his conversation and his writing . How could he be other than truthful , lovely , charitable , and tasteful in his pictures , who , in his home as in society , in his teaching as in his conduct , was habitually sincere , affectionate , equable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather on the good than on the bud about him ? It would be well if there were more lives that should show so exact a parallel of good attributes in the workman and his works . " In 1859 , on the 5th of May , after a brief illness , Leslie closed this life with full faith in a glorious immortality . He had always cherished bright and cheerfnl views of a future existence . To his son George he said , " lie thought it very likely that part of our happiness in the next life would be derived from finding out the wonders of creation which are hidden to us here . " The realities of that state of being upon which he had often mused , he was now soon to know . As he approached the change , his love of art seemed to grow stronger . He had several of his favorite pictures placed so that he could see them from his bed , and his son remarks that he never saw him enjoy anything more keenly than he did some photographs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheered him through the journey of life shed its halo around him during his latest moments here , arid throw a splendor. into the eternal world . He met his last change with that calm faith in God and Christ which was apparent in all he had said or done . The religion which , through life , had been his guide and support , gave to him , as he passed upward and onward , an unclouded and delightful trust . Nothing could alter his conviction in the Divine truth which was uttered by the Saviour . With his usual liberality , he declared that he believed that God permits different estimates of Christ 's character to exist in the world , that our attention may be constantly drawn to it by discussion ; and the following passage was found , written in his own hand , on a slip of paper attached to his will : - " I trust I may die as I now am , in the entire belief of the Christian religion , as I understand it from the books of the New Testament ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will and goodness of God towards this world , by Jesus Christ , the Saviour and Judge of the world . In full reliance on the special providence of God , I feel sure that whenever , and by whatever means , I die , will be the best for me ; and I trust this belief will always make me patient and submissive to the will of God , feeling sure that there is no real evil but sin , from which I pray God to deliver all of us , now and hereafter .
