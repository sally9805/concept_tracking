THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT . WITH PORTRAIT OF SECRETARY MCCTJLLOCH . So long as the country struggles under a vast National Debt , a depreciated Currency , and the Taxation which these involve , the department of government which has charge of its loans , currency , ned revenues , and whose duty it is to adjust all these to the industry , commerce , and genius of our people , must be of chief importance . We had been accustomed before the rebellion to style the Secretary of State , Premier . Questions of international policy then chiefly engaged the attention of statesnien and the sympathies of the people . With the progress of the war the country leaned alternately on the Seqretaries of War and of the Treasury . But with the return of peace , the disbandment of our armies , the adjustment of all foreign complications , and the accession of all the disaffected and rebellious portion of our people to such a share of political power as may enable them to affect and embarrass the levy of taxes , the payment of the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the questions growing out of our financial condition supersede all others , and make the Secretary of the Treasury , next to the President , the most responsible officer of the government . In England the First Lord of the Treasury is Premier . In France , Prussia , and the other European Governments , the duties of Minister of Finance , of Revenue , and of Commerce , which we concentrate upon our Head of the Treasury , are divided among various ministers , who in the aggregate exercise a commanding influence in their several cabinets . Yet nowhere have financial questions such urgency , and even danger , as in the Uaited States . Whether compared , therefore , with other officers of our own government , or with any member of foreign administrations , the post of Secretary of the Treasury of the United States involves the most important , delicate , unprecedented , and difficult functions . The practical difficulties are hardly less than during the war ; for then patriotism silenced censure , and nearly all men , conscious of the appalling difficulties of the financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advise . But now every tyro has become a financier and trance-mediums in every village offer for a small charge to reconcile wounded lovers , or to answer nil difficult questions of finance . A politician who would not claim to be competent to make a shoe , not having learned the trade , will without hesitation and without study construct a new national banking system , or destroy the old . When so many accomplished free lances in finance are entering the field , men who have given their lives to the careful study and successful administration of monetary affairs naturally feel unwilling to risk the dangers of a competition in which success provokes as severe criticism as defeat . The affairs of x*ihicls the Secretary has charge employ the constant services of 15,993 offleers , clerks , and em.ploy*s , of whom 3,520 are in the Bureaus at Washington , 5,151 are in the Custom-Houses and Sub-Treasuries , and 7,322 are in the Internal Revenue service , including inspectors , collectors , assessors , etc. , throughout the United States . Of the 41,000 officers of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Treasury . To give an outline of the organization of this vast force , through whose hands every dollar of the funds of the government has been collected and disbursed , would be more laborious than interesting . The inquiring mind learns , with a misty sense of undefined acquisition , that the Treasury Department is divided into eighteen Bu // reaus , viz. : the Secretary 's , First Comptroller 's , Second Comptroller 's , Cornmissioner of Customs , First , Second , Third , Fourth , Fifth , and Sixth Auditor 's , Treasurer 's , Register 's , Solicitor 's , Comptrollers of the Currency and of Internal Revenue , Statistics , Court Survey , and Light-Houses . Of these the Auditors and Comptrollers are engaged in examining accounts of receipts and expenditures , the investigation and decision by the Auditor being preliminary , and by the Comptroller final . Three Auditors and one Comptroller are occupied with military and naval accounts , and the like force with the civil . Every payment is authorized by the Secretary only after its propriety has been certified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expenditures are kept by the Treasurer , the Comptroller , the Register , and the Secretary , but most fully by the Register . Collectors and Receivers account weekly , mohthly , and quarterly , according to the amounts of their collections . They are brought to account in cases of delay by the Comptroller and Solicitor of the Treasury . The functions of the other Bureaus are suggested by their titles . Each of these Bureaus is further divided into divisions , of which the Secretary 's comprises the following : " Of Warrants , " " Appointments , " " Currency , " " Redemption , " " Loans , " " Captured and Abandoned Property , " " Revenue-Tariff , " " Revenue-Marine , " " Remission of Forfeitures , " " Fines and Penalties , " " Internal Revenue Law , " " Internal Revenue Finance , " " Customs , " Administration , and Warehousino* " " Steamboat-Inspection , " " Shipping and Consular Correspondence , " " Supervising Architect , " " Recording and Library Documents and Files , " and " Printing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the credit of the Treasury . Upon the certificates of deposit the Register fills out the bonds , which since 1563 are printed in the Printing Division of the Secretary 's Bureau , and sends them to the Loan Branch of the Secretary 's office , where they are recorded , countersigned , and compared with the certificates of deposit and the books . Thereupon the certificates of deposit are cancelled to prevent their use again , and the cancelled certificates and bonds are returned to the Register , who issues the latter to the public creditor . The legal-tender notes , commonly called " greenbacks , " are engraved and printed in New York by the American and National Bank-Note Coinpanies. * The notes are forwarded by express to the Secretary , delivered to the Chief of the Currency Bureau , there counted , separated , trimmed , examined , and delivered to the Treasurer , who credits them in his accounts , and he becomes debited on the books of the Register . They are paid to the public hy the Treasurer . No money is received into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Comptroller , the Register , and finally of the Secretary himselt All moneys are received and certificates of deposit are issued by the receiver as deposited to the credit of the Treasurer , and paid by checks on the depositaries . In conducting the Treasury , there is no alternative but to exempt the Secretary from responsibility for the countless millions which go through his hands , or to pass every dollar under his eye . The latter course , the only one involving actual safety to either the Secretary or the people , involves a great deal of drudgery in the mere reading and signing of papers , in which a single erroneous signature might cost the country thousands of dollars ; and the Secretary his honor and position . By no amount of organization , therefore , can the Secretary avoid the vast drudgery essential to the merely HONE5T performance of his duties . Only after this labor has been performed can he give attention to the appointment and removals of his 16,000 subordinates , and to the myriad questions of law , expediency , method , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * In the printing of notes by these Con-ipa ice , whether for our o n Government or for the various Europoan and American nations which they have furniehed with a paper currency , no instance of loss has ever occurred . // and village in the land in swarms like the flies of Egypt into the palaces of Pharaoh , for his assignment , consideration , and decision , and finally to those great and unprecedented questions of politics , political economy , and finance , whereia he is often expected to agree with the less informed , to ignore oh5tacles which he knows to be insurmountable , to dash after results without the means of attaining them , and to drop the unattractive but essential substance for the more alluring shadow . No Secretary of the Treasury has enjoyed larger opportunities than Mr. MeCulloch for a thorough and practical education in finance before entering upon his office . He is of Scottish family , as his name indicates , and his personal habits and financial views are of the Scottish-American pattern . He aims to succeed through patient labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty , rather than by brilliant strokes of genius . His grandfather , Adam MeCulloch , emigrated from Dornoch , Scotland , and settled in Arundel , Maine ( now Kennebunk Port ) , about the year 1765 . He was a fine scholar , and , like so many of the Scotch , was thrifty , hospitable , clannish , and of most excellent humor . As a merchant he acquired a handsome fortune . His father was likewise a merchant , and , at the commencement of the war of 1812 , was one of the largest and most enterprising ship-owners ill New England . The war , with the restrictions it involved , swept away his fortune in its general havoc of commercial interests . About the time his father 's embarrassments conimenced , Mr. McCulloch was born , and he received only the advantages of an academical education , and of a little more than a single year at Bowdoin College . Leaving college in his sophomore year , then seventeen years old , he engaged in teaching , and continued to teach until 1829 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read law . TIe commenced the study of law in Kennebunk , his native town , whence he removed , in 1832 , to Boston , and there completed his legal studies . Having long previously resolved to make his home in the West , he left Boston in April , 1833 , and in June following ar rived in Fort Wayne , Indiana , then a frontier trading-post , described by him as a " mere dot of civilization in the heart of a magnificent wilderness. ** About that time , however , it began to grow rapidly , and is now the second city in the State . In the Fall of 1835 he was invited , though a young man with little experience in business , to organize and take the management of a Branch of the State Bank of Indiana , at Fort Wayne . He accepted the offer without intending to abandon his profession , but in a few months became so interested in banking , that he determined to make it his permanent business . In 1836 he was elected a Director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mana* , er of the Branch , and a Director of the Bank , until the expiration of the charter , in 1857 . The great success of that admirably conducted banking institution was very largely the result of his financial conservatism and ability . In 1856 a new bank , known as the Bank of the State of Indiana , was chartered , with twenty branches , and an authorized capital of six millions of dollars . Mr. MeCulloch was , by the unaniLnous vote of the Directors , elected President . Under his skilful management , aided by the best financiers in the State , this Bank took high rank among the large banking institutions of the country . It maintained specie payments during the trying periods of 1857 and 1861 , and until its branches were merged in the National Banking System , it was one of the strongest ( if not the very strongest ) and most wisely conducted Banks in the United States . The bill providing for a National Currency through the agency of National Banks , became a law in February , 1863 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Chase , the Secretary of the Treasury , to become the Comptroller of the Currency , and to undertake the very difficult task of // organizing a National Currency Bureau , and bringing the banking institutions of the States under the national banking law . The request was promptly complied with , although the acceptance of the office involved a large sacrifice of income and of comfort on the part of Mr. McCulloch . The ability with which this task was accomplished was recognized and appreciated by the bankers and business men throughout the country , and , in connection with his previous experience as a banker , had great weight with the press and people in influencing them to urge upon President Lincoln his appointment as Secretary of the Treasury . This office came to him almost by necessity , as the consequence of his banking experience and his familiarity with finance . Mr. Fessenden , talented as he is , had accepted with reluctance , and held with hesitation and diffidence , the reins of the Treasury . Mr. Chase , in whose great abilities enthusiastic confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transferred to a higher but less difficult and arduous position . Mr. Cisco , who had been in charge of the Sub-Treasury at New York , and whose practical acquaintance with banking and finance was second only to that of Mr. McCulloch , was the leading name mentioned in Eastern circles for the position . Mr. McCulloch , as Comptroller of the Currency , already presided over a leading bureau of the Treasury , and was most familiar with the workings of the entire department during the two last years of the war . His antecedents , experience , and character , combined to present him as the most ablc and available successor of Mr. Fessenden . The Western press and people , led by the Chicago Tribune and the Legislatures of Indiana , Illinois , and other Western States , by resolution spontaneously concurred in praying for his appointment . President Lincoln , as was his wont , bowed to the popular demand , with which his own judgment fully agreed . On Mr. MeCulloch 's accession to the office of Secretary , in March , 1865 , he announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans the money necessary to pay the soldiers of the great Union army , and all other demands upon the Treasury ; 2d . To fund all obligations as they should mature into gold-bearing bonds ; 3d . To contract the currency steadily , on the theory that its depreciation was due in great part to the excessive quantity in circulation , until its value should advance to par with gold , thereby restoring the government and the country to specie payments , and turning the people from speculation and gambling , with all their unhealtliful immoral tendencies , back to legitimate industry and business , with the blessings which attend them ; 4th . To keep the public revenues sufficiently in excess of the expenses to enable him to devote $200,000,000 per annum toward paying the principal and interest of the national debt , thereby securing the payment of the debt in less than a third of a century . Whatever adverse criticism the carrying out of these views subsequently provoked , they received , when uttered , the general assent of the people , as well as the special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not versed in finance , yet it is one of the characteristics of a republican government that , even in finance , no policy can be maintained Which the masses of the people can not comprehend and approve . Mr. MeCulloch has been held to account because some $800,000,000 of 7.30s and $600 ,  - -  000,000 of other securities due in 66 , 67 , and 68 , and bearing interest at 7* per cent . in currency , have been funded into Five-Twenty bonds bearing inter*st at 6 per cent , in coin . It is argued that as coin has maintained from the year 65 to the present time an average premium of 40 per cent , over currency , the six per cent . coin interest has been equivalent to at least 8* interest in currency , and this increase of 1* per cent . interest in currency has thus far increased our annual interest by at least $10,000,000 . By lessening the utility of currency in paying the national interest and increasing the necessity for // gold , it has depreciated the former and enhanced the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a practical obstacle to specie payments . It is true that when we return to specie payments our interest will have been diminished by the funding of the 7.30s , but thus far it has been increased . To all such criticisms it may fairly be replied , that the 7.30s ran for so short a time , that had they not been funded their holders would long ere this have been demanding their payment . And as the Government was clearly unable then to pay , either in gold or currency , nearly one half of the national debt , it was necessary to fund them into bonds , and none more favorable were authoriEed or possible than the 5.20s . Moreover , the Act of Congress made them coiivertible , at the pleasure of the holders , into 5.20s ; and though the Secretary executed the law , he can not be held responsible for a policy laid down for him by the higher authority of Congress . The Secretary 's policy of contraction of the currency was at first endorsed by Congress , a was regarded for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was subjected to only a partial trial , and the current of opinion soon set so strongly against it , as a means of restoring specie payments , that it was overruled by Congress , and the Secretary , though adhering to his original views , obeyed the voice of the people 's representatives . The opponents of contraction have been more successful in thwarting the policy than hi agreeing upon the grounds for its defeat . Its more ultra opponents urge that the theory of contraction is defective at the outset , in that it assumes that the value of the currency depends on its volume merely , whereas its value , they argue , depends on that of the entire bulk of the national debt . Paper currency has been defined by some economists as transferable debt , since all transferable debt may be used as a means of payment  --  and therefore as a currency . Hence , in the view of such , the only true contraction is the payment of the debt , and any other only substitutes interest-bearing bonds for noninterest-bearing notes , i. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more convenient . They point , in support of the dependence of currency for its value on the bonds , to the fact that the bonds and currency , whether at par with gold as in 1860 , at 40 per cent , as in 1864 , or at 78 per cent , as now , have always fallen and risen pan pa8su-the bonds being worth only as much more than currency as was caused by their interest-bearing quality . While these views have great plausibility , if not force , their advocates will hardly claim that a bond for a large sum , due with interest at a distant day , has all the features of currency which belong to notes for small sums , payable on demand without interest . As Ibe ready exchangeability of the security increases , its liability to be used and classed as a currency increases . Evidently , the conversion of the whole national debt into currency would vastly increase its depreciation , and probably would reduce its value to a merely nominal figure , like that attained in 1863 and 1864 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a given amount of the national debt in the form of non-interestbearing notes , tends far more to depreciate public credit , enhance the premium on gold , and delay a return to specie payment , than would any amount of debt invested in long interest-bearing bonds . So far , therefore , the violent assaults on the theory of contraction bave bred distrust , but have failed to vindicate the absolute denial of its efficacy . Other opponents of contraction allege that after business has adapted itself to a certain volume of currency , no matter what that volume may be , it is as great an evil to contract as it was to expand it ; that business requires chiefly permanence , and that specie payments should be resumed by authorizing all contracts to be made in gold or depreciated paper , as parties prefer , and all courts of law to recognize the difference of value . This , it is thought , would lead to the gradual substitution of the gold standard for the paper , reducing the sums // named in outstanding debts payable in currency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually worth . This would produce resumption , without swelling the burden of debts contracted in currency , worth only 40 or 78 cents per dollar in gold , by compelling the debtor to pay them in currency worth 100 . Undoubtedly , the popular objection to resumption now lies in the hostility of the debtor-class to having 40 per cent . added to the burden of their debts , by contracting to that extent the currency in which they are to be paid . The difficulty lies , not in resumption by the Government , but by the people . It would be of no use to make their paper currency worth 40 per cent . snore than their privatc debts , for they could not afford to use it as a means of payment any more than they can now afford to use gold . In the event of a contraction that would carry greenbacks to par with gold , their private debts would therefore go unpaid , and would soon constitute an inferior currency , over which the greenbacks would bear a premium . In short , contraction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and leave the people without a currency corresponding in value to their money of account and exchange , except in so far as they should make one for themselves , by substituting private notes for those of GoVernment . Without agreeing with all these premises , Mr. McCulloch strongly favors the policy of authorizing gold contracts and of taking such . legislative measures as will cause contracts , now payable in currency , to be changed upon terms equally just between debtor and creditor , to contracts payable in gold at the reduced figures . He thinks this would promote returns to specie payments by a mode which , if the law were properly guarded , could not be made oppressive to the debtor-class , while it Would be entirely acceptable to creditors . Still other opponents of contraction-at the head of whom stands that eminent American economist , Henry C. Carey-asserts that our entire note-currency amounts to only $20 per capita , while the entire currency of England is $25 per capita , and that of France $30 per capita , though about half of the former and seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eras of expansion and speculation to the excessive discounts and deposits of the banks , contending that these are the most fruitful sources of expansion , and that they , rather than bank-notes or Government-notes , constitute a currency which needs check , regulation , and limitation . On the other hand , Mr. MeCulloch , in his Report for 1865 , elaborately argues that the expansions in bank deposits and discounts , which led to the crises of 1837 and 1857 , were preceded by corresponding expansions in the bank-note circulation , and that the inflation of notes occasioned the inflation of deposits and discounts , the underlying cause of both being our overtrading with Europe , and the enormous credits , and delay in settling the balances to which this overtrading gave rise . The policy suggested by Mr. MeCulloch , in 1865 , for paying the debt in thirty-two years , was exceeded during the years 66 and 67 , in which one tenth of the entire debt was paid off . Indeed , if we include the unliquidated portion of the debt incurred at the close of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transportation , etc. , with the amount for which bonds were issued , our entire debt outstanding on June 1st , 1865 , was more than $3,800,000,000 , and our entire payment on account of it exceeds $830,000 ,  - -  000 , or more than a fourth of the.principal . The strain on the taxpayers , however , was deemed excessive , and during the present year the revenue is intended to barely equal expenditures . Under this relaxation the country will probably so far recover its financial health and tone as to resume the payment of its debt within a year or two at most , and the average rate of payment will vary but little from the Secretary 's estimate . In his Report for 1865 , the startling fact is advanced that the usual products of our industry exceed 25 per cent . upon the total values of the real and personal estate of the country , and that his proposed // rate of paying the principal would absorb less than S per cent . of our annual productions the first year , and barely one tenth of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While these facts show that the payment of the principal should be deemed not only practicable but easy , they also raise the question whether it is true economy to take from the taxpayers capital which , in their hands , is earning 25 per cent. , in order to cancel a debt which we can carry for six per cent . Mr. MeCulloch , however , with the financial conservatism natural to his character , stands as much opposed to all schemes for perpetuating as to those for repudiating the debt . He no more regards a national debt as a national blessing , than a private debt as an individual boon . It must ultimately be paid . But until it can be paid , let it be made as useful as possible . Our banking system must be founded on debts or bonds of some kind as security for its bank-note circulation . The security of the national bonds has been found so perfect , that the notes of the few national banks which failed , have borne a premium instead of being at a discount , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discount in Maine . Mr. MeCulloch 's agency in founding the national banking system has been second only to that of Mr. Chase . All his Reports contain sound and elaborate defences of the system , as the only source from whence we can derive a currency that shall expand and contract with the wants of the community , and shall be of uniform value throughout the country . In his Report of December , 1865 , he thus states his views of the legal-tender notes : The right of Con* , ress , at all times , to borrow money and to issue obligations for loans in such form as may be convenient , is unquestionable ; but their authority to issue obligations for a circulating medium as money , and to make these obligations a legal tender , can only be found in the unwritten law which sanctions whatever the representatives of the people , whose duty it is to maintain the Government against its enemies , may consider in a great emergency necessary to be done . The present legal-tender acts were war-measures , and while the repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money is not now recommended , the Secretary is of the opinion that they ought not to remain in force one day longer than shall be necessary to enable the people to prepare for a return to the constitutional currency . * * * * * The reasons which arc sometimes urged in favor of United States notes as permanent currency are , the saving of interest and their perfect safety and uniform value . The objection to such a policy is , that the paper circulation of the country should be flexible , increasing and decreasing according to the requirements of legitimate business , while , if furnished by the Government , it would be quite likely to be governed by the necessities of the Treasury or the interests of parties , rather than the demands of commerce and trade . Besides , a permanent Government currency would be greatly in the way of public economy , and would give to the party in possession of the Government a power which it might be under strong temptations to use for other purposes than the public good-keeping the question of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than which few things would be more injurious to business . But the great and insuperable objection , as already stated , to the direct issue of notes by the Government , as a policy , is the fact , that the Government of the United States is one of limited and defined powers , and that the authority to issue notes as money is neither expressly given to Congress by the Constitution , nor fairly to be inferred , except as a measure of necessity in a great national exigency . No consideration of a mere pecuniary character should induce an exercise by Congress of powers not clearly contemplated by the instrument upon which our political fabric was established . As soon as we shall have returned to specie payments , Mr. MeCulloch believes the national system should be made one of free banking ; but he would renard no additional deposit of securities as effectual to prevent inflation if banks were authorized to issue unlimited quantities of depreciated paper . He has been persistent in advocating a rigid maintenance of the public faith against the proposed schemes of paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to subject the bonds to local taxation , as calculated to prevent a general distribution of them among the States and counties in which taxes have so little equality , and to // cause a larger export of bonds to foreign countries , thereby increasing the annual drain of gold to foreign creditors . It is seriously to be feared that the natural tendencies of this , as of other countries , would be to repudiate its debt , if it should adopt such legislation as would cause but few of its own people to owa its bonds . The honor of a nation is always endangered when it is separated from the interests of its people . As a financial statesman , Mr. McCulloch is an impressible and open listener to the advocates of conflicting policies , but cautious and conservative in the formation of his own views . His reports often recognize the premises on which adverse theories are based , while coming to modified or opposite conclusions . He is non-partisan in finance , as in politics . Often facts on which persons with a less comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , serve with him only to modify different views , or qualify other conclusions . He appreciates much with which he does not agree , and cares more to harmonize practical difficulties than to ride hobbies or be sustained in pet theories . He is more able than brilliant , more safe than original , more successful than talented . His industry in prosecuting business , and promptness in despatching it , are remarkable . Appearing at his office regularly at half-past eight o'clock in the morning , he goes straight to work , and never pauses nor tires until every item of business has been disposed of ; or referred to the proper bureau of the department , and every visitor has been seen and his complaint or other business considered . For twenty-five years he has not lost a day from the like vigorous and rigid attention to business . If he has not the imperious and combative genius of a professional reformer , he is open to all suggestions , and his entire influence is given to prevent abuses . His successor will enter upon the office relieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fessend en , and MeCulloch . He will find the financial policies of the country , relative to debt , taxation , and currency , in many respects matured , and the machinery of government adjusted to its new conditions and running smoothly . Instead of being called on to raise vast sums by loans in excess of the annual revenue , upon a credit which must sink lower with each new burden , he will be engaged in reducing the debt by steps which , however unskilfully performed , can only advance the national credit . Eleven hundred millions of short debts fell due during McCulloch 's administration , the funding of which into long bonds has constantly increased the gold-bearing portion of the debt , and so kept gold up , and the national credit depressed . His successor will find these short debts all funded , and demanding no further attention within twenty years than the payment of the interest . The questions of financial policy which have been a*itated in the pending election will be settled by its result . The policy of so adjusting our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been inaugurated by the Republican party in the Morrill tariff of 1861 and 2 and its amendments , which were passed pursuant to the protective clause in the Chicago platform of 1860 , and having been distinctly adopted and endorsed by the protective section of the Democratic platform adopted in New York , may for the present be regarded as the undisputed policy of the American people without distinction of party . The fact that the Democratic party in its recent platform made no assault upon the National Banking System , removes that much-vexed question from the arena of politics and leaves the system intact , to be expanded and perfected as the wants of our people require . The questions involved in Reconstruction are also settled , and the national credit will be relieved of their embarra , ssrnent . This alone should take off a third of the premium on gold which has prevailed while they were pending . The funding of our accruing short debts into bonds due twenty years hence , the effect of which is now just beginning to // be felt , will tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a decline of gold to par . Our bonds could not rise to par so long as new issues were constantly being thrown on the market . Now that this has ceased , their advance toward par must begin . While this advance results from work performed by Mr. MeCulloch , its effects , viz. , a fall of gold and return to specie payments , will be manifest during the term , and will redound to the credit , of his successor . It only remains , to perfect our national credit , that our annual productions shall once more exceed our expenditures , so that our exports , exclusive of bullion , may pay for our imports , and the balance of trade with Europe turn again in our favor . This will cause an accumulation of gold in the vaults of the banks , and the advance of public and private credit to par with specie . While the incoming secretary , should the country remain at peace , will find flowers thus blooming in his path where only thorns beset his predecessors , his office will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of banking and finance . One of the first measures of the new administration , if it shall not be accomplished during the remainder of Mr. MeCulloch 's term , must be the retirement of the remnant of the greenback currency and the expansion of the National Banking System , so as to make it free , and its benefits equal throughout the country . A bank is a shop for buying and selling money . There are the same reasons against allowing the privilege of banking to be monopolized by those now engaged in it , as there are against confining the right to sell meat to the number now selling meat . The latter would make meat dear , and the former makes money scarce and high , and prevents the banks from rendering their full service to business . The present banking system went into effect when the West was too poor to embrace fully its advantages , and when the rebellion prevented the South from doing so . The total amount of currency which may be issued under it to all the banks is $300,000,000 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the privilege of circulating notes , can be started . So large a proportion of this $300,000,000 has been issued to the States east of Ohio and north of Maryland , and so little to those South and West , as to give the former about $100 ,  - -  000,000 more bank-note circulation than they had before the war , and the latter nearly as much less . This inequality is felt in a great dearth of currency in the South and West relatively to the East . The banking system with its present limitation is bark-bound . It must have leave to grow , or die . Great practical difficulties surround this question . Many of the measures which have been proposed in and out of Congress would flood the country with an unlimited issue of irredeemable paper currency . The greenbacks must be withdrawn in order to make room for the bank-notes . But heretofore the latter have derived their fixed value from the fact that they were redeemable in the former . When the greenback shall be withdrawn , in what shall the bank-notes be redeemable ? If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their expansion and depreciation . If in gold , then our banking system can not be made free till we return to specie payments . Yet it is as unjust that men should be prohibited from entering into the banking business , or rather that some should be prohibited and others permitted , because our national bonds are not at par in the markets of the world , as it is that the sale of meat or drygoods should be confined to the shops already started for that purpose . And it would doubtless tend little more to injure our industry , and delay a return to specie payments , to limit our drygoods trade to the dealers now in the business , than to limit our banking to our present number of banks and bankers . And whatever is unjust is unnecessary . This is one of the opening channels of difficulty for the new Secretary , in which it will be indispensable that he shall go forward , and yet disastrous unless he steers wisely . We are // not yet in a condition where the affairs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wheel is inquiring " what he shall do to he saved . " We might enlarge upon the other difficulties which beset the Treasury Department , but until the reader has solved the last , it suffices to show the danger of regarding this important office as something to be struck off to the highest bidder . Better , like the ancient Romans , sell our leading offices at auction , than consign the administration of our national finances to a mere politician who , without any pretence to familiarity with finance , may bring the strongest partisan pressure to bear . In the present declension in importance of our diplomatic service , our foreign ministries should afford ample asylums for disappointed aspirants , and they may wisely and safely be reserved for that purpose .
