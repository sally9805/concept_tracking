Scene .  --  In the State of Kentucky . Time .  --  First decade of the Nineteenth Century . Main text ACT I. Scene I.  --  A Club-room , handsomely furnished . Rufus Wolfe , Barnabas , Mr. Lowe , and several gentlemen , reading papers , &c.; Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Our new member is not stirring yet . 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman No  --  thanks to your sleight of hand last night . I should not be surprised if he did n't stir for a month . 2d Gent . 2d Gentleman I never saw a jollier initiation ! Bar . Barnabas He may not be so jolly when he 's sober . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Oh , he wo n't remember his assaults on our friend Lowe : eh , Cardinal ? Lowe . Mr. Lowe But I 'll take care he shall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the deeds of wine evaporate with its effects . Bar . Barnabas I never saw a wilder fellow in his cups . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe I thought him rather serious . Did not you , Cardinal ? ( To Lowe . ) Lowe . Mr. Lowe I tell you what , gentlemen , I 'll resign my presidency of this club , if I 'm not protected against every dare-devil , who , inspired by Wolfe 's mad humors , plays off his drunken jokes on me  --  I will . All . All No  --  no . Ha ! ha ! Lowe . Mr. Lowe I will , gentlemen ,  --  I do protest I will ,  --  if it even shatters the unity of the society  --  I will . Several . Several Oh , no . Enter Eustace Clifden. 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman Our new member ! Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Good morning , Clifden . Several . Several Good morning . ( Salute him . ) Clif . Eustace Clifden Good morning , gentlemen . ( Goes to Lowe . ) Mr. Lowe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saves me the necessity of calling upon you . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Bravo , Clifden ! Lowe . Mr. Lowe Calling upon me , sir ! for what , Mr. Clifden ? Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe For what ? Oh , innocent Cardinal  --  for satisfaction , to be sure . Lowe . Mr. Lowe Sir , I 'll resign this moment . Clif . Eustace Clifden Allow me , Mr. Lowe , to apologize for my rudeness to you last night . I was not conscious of it , I assure you ; and I am indebted to the kindness of some friends for the information this morning . Lowe . Mr. Lowe You were rude , sir , that you were . Clif . Eustace Clifden I am sorry for it , Mr. Lowe ; sorry that I should , without cause , affront any man , but more especially one whose position should be sufficient protection against insult . I sincerely apologize . 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman I should think an apology from any member of the club , for any reason , decidedly inexcusable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifden ( calmly . ) It was , sir , thoroughly unwarrantable on my part to offer a rudeness to you ; and I say again , I apologize . Lowe . Mr. Lowe It was unwarrantable ; but , sir , since you have the manliness to apologize , I give you my hand ( Lowe and Clifden shake hands ) , and I hope you have safely survived the pains of initiation . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Does the head ache still ? Bar . Barnabas Are the nerves disordered ? 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman Hand shaky ? Lowe . Mr. Lowe In a word , my good sir , are you washed out ? Ha ! ha ! Clif . Eustace Clifden No , but to say truth , I feel inexpressibly ashamed . Bar . and 1st and 2d Gent . Barnabas , 1st Gentleman , 2d Gentleman Ha ! ha ! he ! Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Nonsense , man . Clif . Eustace Clifden I am very sorry you persuaded me to join your club . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Persuade ! ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be recognized , must go through it . Bar . Barnabas Your regrets are treasonable . Clif . Eustace Clifden I feel them , nevertheless . I must have been wild , if what I hear be true . 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman Slightly elevated , that 's all . Clif . Eustace Clifden I never was slightly elevated before , and , club or no club , I never will be again . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe We have all said the same thing once . Clif . Eustace Clifden I can not , even now , understand it . I drank but little wine . Lowe . Mr. Lowe Precious little . Ha ! ha ! But you may thank Wolfe 's adroitness in mingling the liquors . Clif . Eustace Clifden What ! Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Pshaw , Clifden , you were never born for a Puritan . You are a fellow for fun , high frolic , and the enjoyment of the earth . 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman Certainly , and if a man may forget himself and be mad for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Temple of Anacreon . Do n't take it so seriously . Bar . Barnabas All over now , you know . Lowe . Mr. Lowe You are young , sir , and likely to be abused ; take the advice of an older man  --  these gay fellows are making fun of you , Mr. Clifden . Several . Several Ha ! ha ! Good ! 1st Gent . 1st Gentleman Very good , your reverence ! Lowe . Mr. Lowe He ! he ! he ! you puppies , I shall leave you to your politics . ( Going . ) I see young Acton is in the field against you ( to Wolfe ) ; take care lest you force me into the opposition . ( Exit , followed by the gents . ) Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Yes , Acton is in the field against me , and I need the services of all my friends . I count on you , Clifden . Clif . Eustace Clifden Whatever I can , I will do ; but  --  Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe No buts . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The life of a man almost depends on his first marked effort . You are just admitted to the bar , and with your reputation as a speaker he , something is expected of you . There could not be a better opportunity to distinguish yourself . You must meet Acton in discussion . Clif . Eustace Clifden Me ? He will need a stronger opponent . Why not do this yourself ? Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe I long for nothing better , but I can not be everywhere . I 'll seek him in time . When do you leave town ? Clif . Eustace Clifden To-day ; within the hour . Bar . Barnabas So soon ? Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Why , I expected you to dinner ; Mrs. Wolfe will be disappointed . Clif . Eustace Clifden I am sorry to deny myself the pleasure , but urgent matters  --  very urgent indeed  --  demand my presence . Bar . Barnabas But a day or two ? Clif . Eustace Clifden I wrote to  --  to  --  my sister  --  Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe What of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let the girls wait ; do n't be a boy always . You will meet some excellent fellows , see how we commence the campaign , and so forth . Bar . Barnabas Strong temptations . Clif . Eustace Clifden Yes , but I confess to my boyhood , and will prove my manhood by resisting your temptations . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Stubborn . Well , I will write to you then . I have a strong desire  --  apart from my own interests  --  to see you in the field . Clif . Eustace Clifden Thank you , I shall hear from you . Adieu . Wolfe. , Bar . Rufus Wolfe , Barnabas Adieu . ( Shake hands . ) Exit Clif . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe He does not know his own powers . We must bring him fully out . Bar . Barnabas ' T is not so easy to meet Acton . What is there against him ? Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe His pamphlet . Every line a man writes is political capital for his enemies . Then , he is obscure , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good reason  --  he does not mix with them ; he is a haughty aristocrat , a man who only knows the people when he wants their votes . Bar . Barnabas Is that actually the case ? Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe Simpleton ! We must make it so . Bar . Barnabas Oh  --  ah  --  yes . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe It may be , or may not be , what is the difference to us . That he is shy and reserved is , I understand , a fact . Well , it is just as likely he is so from pride as any thing else , do you see ? Perhaps he 's a fellow of delicate feelings ! So much the better . People do n't like fellows of delicate feelings . Ha ! ha ! Delicate feelings are very unpopular things . They alone would go hard against him . If we could have him persuaded to wear kid gloves it would save us a few thousand . Kid gloves are not popular ; if any thing , they are more ruinous than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Could n't the popular eye discover a demijohn in his study  --  ay , could it ! Ha ! ha ! Pride , tender feelings , kid gloves , private demijohn  --  political death , certain . Come along , Barnabas , old boy , we must let the people know of these things . Exit Wolfe and Bar . Scene II .  --  On the skirt of a wood overlooking the ruined village of Eaglemont . Enter Old Acton and William Acton . Old A. Old Acton ( contemplating the scene ) . We are here again , William ; here , without a single companion of all those old ones who were associated with that once dear village ; and yet we are not without some of the old friends  --  the old trees and rocks and hills are about us . Bless me , I feel the former life , if not the old feelings ; yet , what a change . Five years have done it all . Five years only , yet what an eternity it seems . Acton . William Acton I see no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it looks as if there were none . Shall we descend into the valley and inquire further ? Acton . William Acton Why , sir , further ? Here , it seems to me , we can Behold enough for melancholy thought . See  --  yonder ruins of my father 's home ; There I first wak 'd to this now weary world ; There was a child ; there sprang from youth to man , Beneath the touch of Love 's delicious hopes  --  Hopes which , alas , that same old roof saw blasted . Old A. Old Acton And there my school-house stands , as years ago , Save that it glooms with age and loneliness . I could embrace my dear old fav'rite oaks ! They seem to welcome me with outstretched arms ; Or , it may be , they wave me from the scene . How much do they recall ! Their shapes have grown Into my heart with the old books I 've read Beneath their patriarchal shelter . Acton William Acton ( musing ) . How brief a term makes life desolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots where stood the cities of the past ; When here , what was , a few short years ago , A thriving , robust village , is but now A bundle of old gables ? Old A. Old Acton Discontent Between a couple of families , my son , Has sundered towns more populous than this . This very cause made you the first to leave . Acton . William Acton Yes , but not willingly I left my home  --  A loving heart , a cruel , brutal fate Drove me from out my native sanctuary . Old A. Old Acton Well , I rejoice that it was so . The necessity which expelled you was the mother of a glorious future . It brought out the manhood that was in you , and will crown your name with honor . Acton . William Acton Yet , sir , I would gladly exchange all  --  All that I am , all that I hope to be , For the dear dreams that fill 'd my boyhood 's home . Old A. Old Acton No , no . To-morrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon , you will feel how idle was the sentiment , seeming so natural to you now . What ? If this was the scene of your sports and love , was it not also the theatre of your denial , your strife , and bitter humiliation : would you feel those pangs anew ? Acton . William Acton No , no ; do not remind me . See there  --  see ! ( Catching Old Acton 's arm . ) Dost not descry a female figure ? There  --  Below the copse : ' T is lost now . There , again , A near the margin of the lake it stands . It looks like her ! Could it be Margaret ! Old A. Old Acton I see . Acton . William Acton Stay , father  --  I would speak with her . ( Going , Old A. detains him . ) Old A. Old Acton Why should ye speak  --  have you any thing pleasant to communicate to each other ? You are unreasonable , my son . ( William subdued . ) And tell me , William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cooper . Acton . William Acton Oh no , sir  --  no ! How could you suppose it ! Old A. Old Acton I do not suppose it ; therefore I say you are unkind , cruel , my son , in your attempt to see that woman you believed to be her . You have no business with her . Acton . William Acton Father  --  my more than father , you are right . I deserve reproof . ' T was a blind impulse . I am a boy still . Let us leave this place . Old A. Old Acton Forget these dreams . All your thoughts need other direction now . Your antagonist if less able , is a more practised politician , and works upon a very perfect organization . Acton . William Acton I was not made for political strife . Old A. Old Acton It is the very sphere of action that will attract you from the chimeras of fancy and boyhood . When you have a seat in Congress you will , in the expansive field before you , forget that such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map . Come , William , to-morrow will see us harnessed for the fight . Exit Old Acton , leading William Acton . Scene III .  --  A Room in Clifden 's Country Cottage , neatly furnished . Maude Clifden , Janette , seated . Maude . Maude Clifden Brother Eustace is outstaying his time . I am the more anxious for his return , because I thought he left us in rather a melancholy mood . Did you not think so ? Jan . Janette Do not fear but he will keep his appointment . Even if he would disappoint us , there are other attractions in this neighborhood from which he would not willingly remain distant . ( Taking a book from the table . ) See there , Maude . Maude Maude Clifden ( reading from fly-leaf ) . " Sybil Hardy . " Why , what a rogue  --  he never mentioned he had met her . Jan . Janette Which only proves the truth of what I say . Maude . Maude Clifden Where did you find this ? Jan . Janette On his dressing-table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have found you out . Well , I 'm glad of it  --  ai n't you ? There will be some reason for his staying with us now  --  we have scarcely seen him since he went studying that stupid law . Jan . Janette I would it were some other than our melancholy neighbor . Maude . Maude Clifden Why , Janette , I do believe you are jealous . Jan . Janette If I were I would not show it , Maude . Maude . Maude Clifden Ha ! ha ! why ' t was but yesterday you said jealousy was the only thing a woman could not hide . Jan . Janette Well  --  yes , a woman who was in love . Maude . Maude Clifden Of course , a woman could not be jealous without being in love . Jan . Janette But she might love without being jealous . Maude . Maude Clifden And that is what my cousin could not do . Jan . Janette ( who has retired towards the window . ) Here he is . Look how he steals along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and now he stops , and dallies , and looks behind him , as if expecting some one . Maude . Maude Clifden Does he not look handsome  --  so tall and graceful . Jan . Janette There 's a cloud upon his brow . Maude . Maude Clifden We will dispel it . Here he comes . Enter Eustace Clifden . Welcome , brother . ( Embraces him . ) Clif . Eustace Clifden Ah  --  dear Maude . Has Cousin Janette no welcome for me ? She forgets the customs of our childhood , when she would cling to me as a vine round the trellis . Jan . Janette And Eustace then told all his secrets to his little cousin . Maude . Maude Clifden Yes , indeed . Ah , ha ! brother , we have found you out . ( Clifden puzzled . ) Jan . Janette ( Showing the book . ) Eh , Master Cunning ! Clif . Eustace Clifden So , Miss Pry-about . Well , Coz , kiss me and I 'll tell you all about it . Maude . Maude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , Clifden kisses Janette , who offers coy resistance  --  they all sit . ) Jan . Janette You did not tell us of your visits to Miss Hardy . Clif . Eustace Clifden You did not tell me that such a beauty adorned the vicinity . Jan . Janette Do you think her a beauty ? Maude . Maude Clifden Of course he does . ( To him . ) Well , how did you meet her ? Clif . Eustace Clifden Well , when home last week I went out shooting  --  Jan . Janette And was struck yourself . Maude . Maude Clifden Now , Janette . Clif . Eustace Clifden I went out shooting , or to shoot ; and , toiling after game in the wood , started , by a lucky shot , a young lady from the thicket : common courtesy commanded me to apologize  --  Maude . Maude Clifden Of course . Clif . Eustace Clifden And see that the frighted creature was not hurt  --  Jan . Janette Or pierced through the heart . Clif . Eustace Clifden She , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drag you after her . Maude . Maude Clifden Oh , Janette , how can you . Clif . Eustace Clifden She hastened , with becoming delicacy , to the open path . I followed , and though she declined my service as escort , I continued , gently insisting , until she came within sight of her cottage . Jan . Janette Did you not go home with her ? Clif . Eustace Clifden No ; but on my return through the wood I found  --  fortunate discovery  --  her veil , which I restored next day ; and made bold to borrow that book  --  and that 's all . Maude . Maude Clifden Quite an adventure ; how could you keep it from us ? Jan . Janette It was too charming for expression . Why , he 's blushing , as I live . Ha ! ha ! Clif . Eustace Clifden Tut , tut , Janette  --  nonsense !  --  just heated with walking . Jan . Janette Heated , indeed , at a snail 's pace . You sauntered along , and looked from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go over to Miss Hardy 's or come here ; and sighed  --  oh , dear ! you could be heard half a mile away . Clif . Eustace Clifden Sigh  --  oh , ridiculous . ( Sighs . ) What do you know of the lady  --  eh , Maude ? Janette , who is she ? Jan . Janette She 's a mystery of some sort or another . Maybe an exiled queen , good lack , or she wants to be thought one . Maude . Maude Clifden Oh , Janette ! Jan . Janette Well , is it not true ? Does she not carry herself like a queen , and is she not as proud and stately as if she would remind us all we were beneath her . Clif . Eustace Clifden She certainly does look queenly . Jan . Janette A tragedy-queen ! Maude . Maude Clifden I 'm sure she is unhappy . Jan . Janette I do n't believe in her unhappiness at all . She is too proud to be so unhappy as you think . Clif . Eustace Clifden Might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unhappiness ? Jan . Janette But are we to sympathize with it ? Clif . Eustace Clifden ( to Maude ) . How long has she resided hereabout ? Maude . Maude Clifden She and her mother came some two years ago  --  just after you left us to study law . They bought the Widow Davis 's cottage , and fixed themselves and a few servants very comfortably . Mrs. Hardy is a good-natured body . Jan . Janette And very silly . I do n't believe she is the mother of our queen at all . Clif . Eustace Clifden ( to Maude ) . And the daughter ?  --  Maude . Maude Clifden She is not very sociable . She is seldom seen by casual visitors ; and , indeed , has not been here more than four or five times . Janette thinks her proud , but I do not . Her manners are dignified ; but there is such a look of sadness in her eyes , that I can not help thinking her unhappy . Probably she has been disappointed in love . Jan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day she is a recluse ; another , she has been engaged , and her lover played false and deserted her  --  Maude . Maude Clifden No , I said he might have been killed in a duel , as any man might be for such a woman . Clif . Eustace Clifden Bravo  --  bravo  --  Maude ! Jan . Janette ' T is well you 're not a man , Maude , or our tragedy-queen would help to kill our cousin . Maude . Maude Clifden Is she not beautiful ? Is she not , brother ? They say , too , that she is intellectual and learned . Clif . Eustace Clifden Who says ? Jan . Janette Who , but old Mrs. Fisher , and solely because she saw her fixing a basketful of books on her shelves . Maude . Maude Clifden Why , Judge Weldon told me he spoke with her , and that he never believed a woman could be so sensible before . Jan . Janette That only shows what a poor judge he is . Maude . Maude Clifden But Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jan . Janette Well , she 's old enough to have the sense of two young women at least . Clif . Eustace Clifden Old ? the lady I mean is certainly not old . Maude . Maude Clifden Cousin Janette is only teazing , thinking that our lovely , but melancholy friend , has bewitched you . She is not old , can not be more than one or two and twenty . Jan . Janette And is not that old ? you are but sixteen , Maude , and I 'm not eighteen  --  I 'm sure Miss Hardy is twenty-five if she 's a day . Maude . Maude Clifden Come , come , Janette , if you stay another minute you 'll have Miss Hardy a gaunt old lady , with a few teeth and a pair of spectacles . Exit Maude and Janette , laughing . Clif . Eustace Clifden Maude is right  --  Sybil 's truly beautiful ! Oh , why have I not known her before now . The moment I but glanced into her eyes I read my destiny . I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face A whole new world leaped into my heart ; A world teeming with a thousand hopes , Each taking inspiration from that face . I 've heard , but never felt its truth till now , That persons of congenial souls exchange Themselves on first collision of their eyes . She has my being , and to win her not Is to abandon and forsake myself . How much I 've lived within a week , and yet , My very strength of feeling calls up fears That goad me with a reckless speed to know , If I may not in her heart 's empire dwell , As she fills up the whole domain of mine . Music as act drop falls . ACT II . Scene I.  --  A wood . A paper mark on trunk of a tree . Sybil Hardy discovered in the foreground firing at the mark with a pistol . After firing , Sybil looks with calm eagerness at the effect . Sybil .

Five years , like monumental marbles rise Above my girlish beauty , and record The gnawing consciousness of coarse deceit , The bitter anguish of defrauded hopes , Mocked aims ; the loss of name , position , love ; The loss of all those dear amenities That should have been the guerdon and the guide , The life itself of the proud , withered youth beneath . ( Weeps . ) ' T is strange these maddening , these blighting years Have left untouched one corner of my brain : That here , far distant from the village where I ruled , already in my youth a queen ; Far from my friends ' condole , my foes ' contempt , That here unknown , unfriended  --  save by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulls her ears to censure , and whose eyes Still fling a tearful glory round her child  --  I teach the woman in her pallid prime T ' avenge my girlhood 's blushing trustfulness .

Oh heaven ! that I were younger by five years . ( Conceals the pistol . ) Enter Eustace Clifden . Clifden . Eustace Clifden Ah , Miss Hardy , pardon my intrusion . It was unintentional . Sybil . Sybil Hardy Your presence is pardonable , Mr. Clifden , but scarcely your excuse . Clif . Eustace Clifden I feared my presence would but awaken a disdain , that one of us , at least , should bear unanswered . Sybil .

Love is a slave , yet those who think they have Timely control of all its dang'rous ecstasies Have never loved  --  or have no power to love . You bid me go , but I dare not depart . Sybil . Sybil Hardy Clifden , ' t were wrong to listen yet again , To what ' t were better I had never heard . I must not  --  better for us both I should not . You found me here in solitude .

Again I say , As , Eustace Clifden , I before have said , I am divided , cut off from the world . How or why it matters not : it is so . Clif . Eustace Clifden Your destiny , dim as you paint its path , But throbs my heart with willingness to share And soothe it . Sybil . Sybil Hardy That can never be . Clif .

Sybil Hardy When we met I hoped I had met a friend , And now I grieve that we have ever met . Clif . Eustace Clifden I pray , thee , Sybil , do not wrong me in this decision . Sybil .

Mr. Lowe Well , the fact is , I have no settled political opinions : I have not made up my mind on the one hand , and on the other I believe young Mr. Acton , whom I have met sometimes , to be a very good and clever fellow . Indeed , I think he would be a very serious addition to our club . Bar . Barnabas A very serious addition , no doubt . Lowe . Mr. Lowe Well , I 've been thinking , Wolfe , if I had two votes I would give you one each ; but as I have only one , I have almost determined not to hurt either of my friends by using it . Wolfe .

Bar . Barnabas Pshaw ! go for your friends , and hang the points at issue . You know our friend Wolfe . Everybody knows him ; while Acton , on the contrary , is but of a few years ' growth amongst us . It is nothing but personal ambition with him . Lowe . Mr. Lowe I think you mistake the young man , or I do . Wolfe Rufus Wolfe ( motioning to Barnabas ) . Our worthy president is right , but he will pledge us his silence ; for next to his aid for us , is his silence for our antagonist . Lowe .

It is no reason , because we are political rivals , why we should not be personal friends . Lowe . Mr. Lowe I meet the old gentleman this evening , at his lodgings at the Red Heifer .

' T is only action makes the present light ; Each resting moment brings the weighty past . Her image ever pleads before my thought With strange prophetic feeling  --  now bright as dawn , Pure in the opening bounty of its light ; And then , as dismal as a shadow cast Across some ravine where a hidden stream Gurgles and moans with wretched energy . Two images of one , and how unlike each other . One , like the eagle soaring in the sun , Its brave soul bounding with the air of heaven ; And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , gloomy as the great bird , caged , Tattered in plumage and with broken wing , Fettered in spirit , and its eyes grown weak With madly gazing at obscurity .

The time will come you 'll wonder this girl e'er Could have been dear to you . Acton . William Acton Never , never . Old . A. Old Acton The passion of the boy , is but a boy passion . Acton . William Acton My mind had not then reached the easy width Which yields an entrance to the grosser thoughts Of years . My heart alone was living then ; And lived but in the thought of her . Old A. Old Acton Years bring grossness only to the gross . Had you your rival 's knowledge of the world You might have been successful . Simply he Held up the mirror to her vanity And pleased her with herself . He fed her with Her own ambition ; little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were All bonded to her brain .

Old Acton Would that restore her To her peace of mind , or obliterate Your memories ? Acton .

Mr. Lowe Well , by taking part with Wolfe , or by adopting your side , in not being able to expound it . Old A. Old Acton Could you expound the opposition ? Lowe .

Mr. Lowe Bad business , by Jove ! and may be a sad business , too . Acton is too wild and Wolfe too wary for good to come of it . So much for my leaving the town , and becoming political mediator in the heat of a raging election . But my conscience is clear as to my good intentions . How could I tell that Wolfe was such a scapegrace , and Acton such a perfect wildcat . I gave sound advice , too , but it was well I was not eaten up alive .

Barnabas Why , at ten paces Wolfe is sudden death ; but Old Acton had the choice of distance , and insisted on five paces , back to back , wheel and fire . Lowe . Mr. Lowe Oh , the old blunderbuss  --  a most murderous affair . Bar . Barnabas The suddenness of the proposition rather irritated Wolfe , who counted on ten ; but for that the news might have been much worse . Lowe . Mr. Lowe And Wolfe ? Bar .

We have been seeking you . Clif . Eustace Clifden ( disconcerted ) . Why , my friend , I did not dream you were Within a dozen miles of us . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe While you Page 48 Were rusticating I have been at work ; And just rode over to confer upon Our prospects ; but , instead of finding you In mood for council , strong with healthy wit , Such as these glorious country scenes inspire , I meet you moody and weighed down as ' t were With premonitions of defeat .

( To Wolfe . ) Ah , Colonel , Love and Politics can not dwell With harmony in that frail tenement . Love is sweet music , full of pettish airs , And thoughtful pain , and pleasures without thought ; While Politics is selfishness grown bold , And for its ends confusing all things else . Love is the heart , and Politics the head , And when there 's strife between them , I well know Which side good Cousin Eustace takes . Maude . Maude Clifden Ah , he has seen his goddess of the Wood  --  ( To Clifden , playfully )  --  Have you not , brother ? Jan . Janette To be sure he has ; Naught else could make him look so cheerful .

Who can she be that holds his heart ? Methinks Its heat will burn her fingers and exhaust Itself . His nature runs into extremes .

No  --  She kept her secret when she married him , And will not blab it now . Bar . Barnabas But the affair With Acton has from Clifden 's ears been kept , Only because he had no ear for aught Save love . He soon must hear of it . Wolfe . Rufus Wolfe No mischief can it work . Did you not hear Me ask him on our last night 's rouse the name  --  The maiden name of Mistress Clifden . Ha ! Forsooth the maiden name  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! Bar .

At the same time , however , ' twill seem well You give him true account of Acton 's brawl  --  All politics , all politics  --  you know : High words , and , to sum up the argument , When reason failed and passion was supreme , Exchange of shots , and so forth  --  do you see ?

And who that bears The lordly title , man , will honor risk To slay a brother for defending woman ? No , I fear not . If law o'er justice vaunts I 'll go myself into the open court , And , as ' fore heaven , will the story tell , In all its plain and foul deformity ; No fear , no shame , shall pale or tinge my cheek , Or wither , by a fluctuating doubt , The fact 's full force upon the jury 's ear .

Mr. Lowe It is well known they quarrelled and fought at their first meeting , upon political grounds ' t was given out  --  Clif . Eustace Clifden Yes , I remember  --  I heard that from Barnabas . Lowe . Mr. Lowe But Barnabas , who was present , told me they quarrelled on account of Mrs. Clifden ( looking round ) , whose name he said was Margaret . Clif . Eustace Clifden Mrs Clifden !

It could not be . Some foul invention To aid his black designs . I never heard Of Acton from my wife . Lowe . Mr. Lowe A rumor is abroad which seems to back the assertion . ( Clifden listens eagerly . ) However , whether true or not , Action must be the man for your defence . Wolfe 's friends are very powerful , and will strain every nerve to effect your ruin . Clif . Eustace Clifden Well , let them triumph ; they but mimic me : I 've had my triumph . Of a truth , I feel That I have done the great deed of my life . Death to me now brings no such agony As it would bring had I not done this deed . And yet  --  to live for Sybil 's sake ? Oh heart ! The thought of losing her brings many deaths , With deeper pangs than the mere loss of life . Lowe . Mr. Lowe Allow me to see Acton . Clif . Eustace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Declare the act And justify it ? ( Pause . ) No : to my own soul  --  To God ' t is justified ; but men who judge , Must know my secret ere ' t is so to them . The damned tale of Sybil 's overthrow , The serpent progress of the venomous head I 've crushed forever , they must hear . How  --  how Can I tell that ? It is impossible . Lowe . Mr. Lowe If you do not decide quickly your friends must act for you . Be advised now  --  do , Clifden , do . His friends must act for him ( aside , and going ) . Clif . Eustace Clifden I thank you sincerely , indeed I do . I will think of what you say . I will  --  I will . Exit Lowe . Re-enter Sybil .

Sybil Hardy Some five-and-sixty years . Clif . Eustace Clifden It is not the same . Perhaps he had a son ? Sybil . Sybil Hardy He had no son : was never married . Clif .

All true ! but , Sybil , my blood chills To think of making a defence . Sybil . Sybil Hardy Why this strange callousness . Clif . Eustace Clifden I killed him ; and evasion would not seek From the confronted dangers of an act Deliberate ; and one I 'd do again . Evasion or suggestion can not come From me , or any interested in me . It must not come . Truth will condemn me , and I knew it with the weapon in my grasp . Sybil . Sybil Hardy What  --  the whole truth condemn us ? Clif . Eustace Clifden Perhaps not ; but how to get the whole truth out : And if it could be done , I could not do it . Sybil . Sybil Hardy Why not , my husband ? Shame now 's gone from us ; We are above the world or beneath it . It gives our hearts no sustenance . It may Scorn me , the miserable victim of its ways , But can it , dare it , call me harlot ? No ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Fell through vain weakness which relied on man : And , oh , if spirit ever felt remorse That doth denote wronged virtue 's penitence , Believe me , Clifden , it was mine .

Let it Know all , if all will any thing avail . With my own tongue would I declare the facts Before I 'd see thee dragged unto the gallows . Clif . Eustace Clifden And I would mount the seaffold a thousand times , Had I a thousand lives , than suffer you To work such cruel wrong against thyself . Live , dearest , live ; and living , daily read The boast I carve upon my tomb  --  I died For thee ! I wed thee for that purpose : I am true to it . Sybil . Sybil Hardy You said you loved me ! Clif . Eustace Clifden And do I not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loves The more he loves to live . ' T is easier To die than live ; which makes life beautiful And grand to those who love ; for love 's true tests Are not so much in overmast'ring hearts , As that grim world which makes the bright heart black .

Sybil Hardy Have we no resource but sorrow , husband ? Who will meet these judges if not you or I ? Your friends all point to Acton  --  why delay ? Oh , Clifden , husband , let no coward shame Hide from all ears the tale of your brave blow .

But wait , wife  --  wait  --  to-morrow  --  Sybil . Sybil Hardy To-morrow ! ( Aside . ) To-morrow , and the chance is lost ; yet I Stand here as though unwed to my avenger , Seeing him fade before my very eyes , Dragging love , life , all hopes of earth and heaven With him .

Old Acton As dreadful , too , the retribution on Alfred Stevens . Little could you have thought Your boyhood 's rival for the village girl Would be your victor on the wider field Of politics : Or that his fastest friend And ablest advocate , in slaying him , Would by the blow avenge thy youthful wrongs . This woman 's mission has been one of woe ; My son , ' t was well ye parted in your youth . Acton . William Acton Had she been mine , this dreadfulest of tales Would never chill men 's veins . Old A. Old Acton It is a tale Which future mothers will rehearse , to teach The heads , if not to touch the hearts , of proud And wilful daughters . Acton . William Acton Can we not aid them ? Clifden 's devotion , if not Margaret 's wrongs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aid them , father ? Old A. Old Acton How , my son ? Clifden hath all resources of the law ; He hath , besides , a worthy pride of brain . Our interference might be misconstrued , If not by him , at least by tetchy friends , So high the flame of party spirit runs , As an assumption of superior skill : And then your duel for the woman 's sake , When her identity is fully known , Perhaps might only , ' stead of mercy , build In the censorious such conjecture as Would act against her . Acton . William Acton I loved her  --  she refused me . That is all  --  Is easily told ; and I am not the man , Nor you to teach me , to allow my pride Rise in rebellion ' gainst a mortal 's life .
