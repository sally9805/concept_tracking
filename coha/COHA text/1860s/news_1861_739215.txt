txt In connection with the unprecedented attempt to surrender the military posts and , property of an entire geographical department of the Army , it may be a matter of interest to the public to know what and howl many forts have been given up to the TexanKnights of the Golden Circle , and to what regiments belong the brave and loyal men who have been thus sacrificed to the sordid passions and craven abjectness of their commander . There were on the 1st January , as we learn from the Army Register , twenty-one posts or garrisons in the Department of Texas . Forts Bliss , Quitman , Davis , Stockton , Clarke , Inge , Duncan , and Brown , Ringgold Barracks and Camp Palo Alto , are on and in the vicinity of the Rio Grande . Fort Merril is on the Nueces , and other stations , including Camp Colorado , Fort Chadbourne , Camp Cooper , Forts Mason and Lancaster , and Camps Hudson , Verde , Ives and Wood , and San Antonio Barracks , are distributed along the northwestern border @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arkansas River . These are garrisoned by detachments of the Second Cavalry , First and Second Artillery , and First , Third and Eighth Infantry . Many of the officers acquired great distinction in Mexico ; among  --  them we can only refer to Cols . WAITE , LEE , BACKUS and HOFFMAN , and Majors FIEINTZELMAN and FRENCH . The gallant Capt . HILL , who is in command of Fort Brown , the papers inform us , has refused to recognize the treasonable and cowardly order of Twmos , and is determined to try conclusions with the piratical party under McCuLLoueu . Capt . HELL is a native of the District of Columbia , and his friends have no reason to fear that he wAl bring reproach upon the spot of his nativity . There is another " Captain , " too , mentioned in the San Antonio accounts of this transaction , who should not be forgotten on this or any other occasion when the vile scandal inflicted by traitors upon our military escutcheon is referred to . His exploits are thus chronicled by the secession press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gallant Capt . REYNOLDS , as true a patriot as Texas can boast , who has resigned his commission under the recent United States Government , deter-ixed to adhere to the cause of the South . " The Texas editor evidently derives his idea of a " patriot " from Dr. 401INSON 'S definition of patriotism ? " the last refuge of a scoundrel . " But it is not impossible that many of our readers will remember to have heard of " the gallant Capt . REYNOLDS " before . We have an impression , not altogether vague and shadowy , that this individual , " as true a patriot as Texas can boast , " has heretofore figured in our public prints , and in no more enviable point of view . If we have not confounded names , this worthy , a few years since , was dropped from the Army for the very venial offence of not balancing his cash accounts , and failing to account to the Government for a large amount of public money with which he had been intrusted . The reader need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corruption should be afforded him , when he remembers who has been actually organizing treason in the War Department , under nearly the whole of Mr. BUCHANAN 'S Administration . It is scarcely necessary to suggest that such qualities as the " gallant REYNOLDS " had displayed , could not fail to commend themselves to the taste of FLOYD , and that the latter restored him to a service which he had disgraced . His first act of gratitude to his benefactor was to make an instantaneous report from Fort Snelling that FLOYD made an excellent bargain for the GOTernment in the famous , or rather infamous , sale of that reservation . With his intermediate history we are not familiar , but the climax is fitting and appropriate , and he turns up anAccomplice in the treason of his patron , FLOYD , and his commander , DAVID E3tANUEL Twines , whose name was stricken from the Army list , by an act of mercy on the part of the Department , a few days since . The pestilent heresy which has always prevailed in Virginia and States south of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and only a secondary and quart allegiance to the United States , has shown its fruits in the numerous cases of desertion and treason which have occurred within the last few months . These cases , which have brought dishonor upon the military service , should cause the utmost care on the part of the authorities at Washington , to avoid trusting Southern men of doubtful allegiance , or dubious honor , in any military or naval command , high or low , on the Southern frontier . None but men of the most tried honor and patriotism should be trusted . When a veteran General is guilty of " treachery to the flag of his country , " it becomes evident that no guaranty is to be found in the high rank and long service for honorable and patriotic adherence to duty . The Heads of the War and Navy Departments should look closely into the character of every individual officer under them , who has been assigned to service on the Southern frontiers and coasts ; and in every instance where there is the least tincture of the mischievous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the culprit should at once be relieved , and transferred to a branch of the service in which he would be less exposed to the temptation of desertion and betrayal . This precaution is fully warranted by the events of the last four months , and no just grounds for complaint would be given by the adoption of this policy . A new oath of allegiance ; should be devised , ? reiterating in the language of the Constitution the supremacy of that instrument , and the laws made in pursuance thereof by Congress , over the Constitutions and laws of the States . The measure now suggested . is demanded by every consideration of public safety . The Military Bureaus in Washington should be subjected to a rigid scrutiny , and any officer known to have been a favorite of FLOYD , COBB , or THOMPSON , should at once be placed where he can render no aid to his old friends by transmitting intelligence of official transactions to traitors and enemies of the country . There is too much reason to fear that this is. still practiced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect thatl , a man who would lend himself to the dishonest and treasonable schemes which characterized the ailministration of FLOYD , would stickle at the , betrayal of his country .
