txt The people will breathe the freer now that there is the prospect of good stiff taxation . Their faint-hearted representatives at last understand that longer evasion of their duty will not be tolerated , and are fairly buckling to the work . They are showing , too , an independence in resisting the appeals of lobby . ists for special favor , that is worthy of praise It seems to be well apprehended that it is a public wrong to ? comply with these appeals however plausible . If the House sticks to the interests of the people in this style for a week longer . it will excite the liveliest astonishment and gratitude . The reluctance which the House has evinced to take up the tax bill has been owing to a shameful distrust of the people . The feeling has prevailed that the people would become disaffected with the war , if their burdens were increased ; and that it was the true policy to make things as pleasant for the time as possible , even at the cost of any amount of suffering after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon to come , Congressmen have had a nervous apprehension , too , that if they taxed , the people would fly into dudgeon , and snuff them out of existence . Now all this is delusion . Ice people are not the dolts they have been taken for . They have not been deceived in the least by these attempts to make the . war seem dog-cheap . It was an insult to them to imagine that they require to be reconciled in any such fashion to the continuance of the war . The people from the beginning have been more determined than the public men  --  have been more earnest , more patient , more ready for any effort or any sacrifice . It is not the politicians that have so upheld their patriotism , but their ; patriotism that has upheld the politicians . From the first uprising , the people have been foremost . The self-styled leaders have not been leaders at all ; they have only followed . The public condition is so different from the ordinary political life of the country , that politicians even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adapt themselves to it . They are constantly running away with the old idea that the people require managing  --  that they are best managed by humoring them ? and that the science of politics is simply the art of cajoling . In the " weak , piping time of peace , " politicians , it must be confessed , piactice upon this theory with considerable success . But in a crisis like this , it is absurdly out of place . It is ridiculous presumption for any public men to imagine that they must wheedle the people in order to hold them to the war , or to suppose that in any degree the war spirit is a political manufacture . This war against the rebellion is the people 's war , just as the rebellion itself strikes at the people 's government . Having accepted the war , the people are prepared to accept all its sacrifices , whether they be of blood or of money . They well understand that it would be just as foolish to attempt to keep up the war by sham battles as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sham unless it draws vitality from living , present , values . Taxation on actual property , they know , is the vital source of all national credit ; and it has been with mingled pity and indignation that they have so long borne with the efforts Of their representatives to evade this palpable truth . They have paid dear for that patience . In lack of the revenues that ought to have been provided for in the first and second years of the war , the Government has been obliged to meet its wants by loans and by unduly large emissions of paper money ; and the consequence has been that the currency of the country has lost nearly half of its producing power , and that all the expenses of the war , as well as all private expenses , have been made nearly double what they otherwise would have been . Thus a vast national debt has been accumulating , which will weigh terribly upon our children , and that too without really lightening our own burdens for the time ; for our comparative freedom from taxation has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency . It was absurd in our Government to imagine that , because taxation is ordinarily an unwelcome thing , therefore the people would be clad to escape , taxation in a way that recoiled upon themselves and their children in this style . The people are too sensible and practical to put up with any , such penny-wise and poundfoolish policy . They are immovably dotermined to prosecute this war to its successful consummation ; and they are just as fully prepared to meet any liability that justly belongs to it . The Government has not shrunk from setting before the people the financial necessity in all its true proportions . Secretary CHASE has declared that taxation to the extent of one-half the current expenditures is needful for the solid credit of the Government . The Tax Bill that he has submitted , through the Committee of Ways and Means , is calculated to meet that requirement  --  estimating the yearly expenses of the Government at eight hundred millions , which , with a properly regulated currency , ought to be the extreme limit . The bill , if allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hundred million dollars , and that , too , without imposing any appreciable burden upon any of the necessaries of life , or in any way injuring the productive energies of the people . This amount , added to the hundred million yielded by the tariff , will secure the credit of the Government beyond all contingencies , whether the end of the war comes soon or late . Members of the House may rely upon it that the bill which they have so dreaded to touch , is welcome to the people ; and that they can not possibly commend themselves better to their loyal constituents than by putting this measure through in the same earnest spirit which they now seem to be displaying . It will be found , when the next elections occur , that the favorite popular test of fidelity to the war will be the staunchness with which this bill is supported . Acts speak louder than words , and a single vote here will be taken as a ten thousand times better proof of the stuff of which a Congressman is made than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . The men in the Capitol can not too well understand this .
