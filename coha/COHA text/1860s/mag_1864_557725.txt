txt ART . X. - Letter of the Secretary of War , transmitting Report on the Organization of the Army of the Potomac , and of the campaigns in Virginia and Maryland under the Command of Major- General George B. McGlellan , frorn July 26 , 1861 , to November T , 1862 . Washington : Government Printing . Office . 1864. 8vo. pp. 242 . WE can conceive of no object capable of rousing deeper sympathy than a defeated commander . Though the first movement of popular feeling may be one of wrathful injustice , yet , when the ebb of depression has once fairly run out , and confidence begins to set back , hiding again that.muddy bed of human nature which such neap-tides are apt to lay bare , there is a kindly instinct which leads all generous minds to seek every possible ground of extenuation , to loQk for excuses in misfortune rather than incapacity , and to allow personal gallantry to make up , as far as may be , for want of military genius . There is no other kind of failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeals to so many of the most deeply-rooted sentiments at once . Want of success in any other shape is comparatively a personal misfortune to the man himself who fails ; but how many hopes , 1 ) rides , sacrifices , and heroisms are centred iii him who wields the embattled manhood of his country ! An army is too multitudinous to call forth that personal enthusiasm which is a // necessity of the heart . The imagination needs a single figure which it can invest with all those attributes of admiration that become vague and pointless when divided among a host . Accordingly , we impersonate in the general , not only the army he leads , but whatever qualities we are proud of in the nation itself . He becomes for the moment the ideal of all masculine virtues , and the people are eager to lavish their admiration on him . His position gives him at a bound what other men must spend their lives in winning or vainly striving to win . If he gain a battle , he flatters that pride of prowess which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual man , is the noblest of passions in a people . If he lose one , we are all beaten with him , we all fall down with our C*nsar , and the grief glistens in every eye , the shame burns on every cheek . Moralize as we may about the victories of peace and the superiority of the goose-quill over the sword , there is no achievement of human genius on which a country so prides itself as on success in war , no disgrace over which it broods so inconsolably as military disaster . There is nothing more touching than the sight of a nation in search of its great man , nothing more beautiful than its readiness to accept a hero on trust . Nor is this a feeble sentimentality . It is much rather a noble yearning of what is best in us , for it is only in these splendid figures which now and then sum up all the higher attributes of character , that the multitude of men can ever hope to find their blind instinct of excellence realized and satisfied . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is something truly feminine in the devotion with which they are willing to give all for and to their ideal man , and the zeal with which they drape some improvised Agamemnon with all the outward shows of royalty from the property-room of imagination . This eagerness of loyalty toward first-rate character is one of the conditions of mastery in every sphere of human activity , for it is the stuff that genius works in . Heroes , to be sure , can not be made to order , yet with a man of the right fibre , who has the stuff for greatness in him , the popular enthusiasm would go far toward making him in fact what he is in fancy . No commander ever had more of this paid-up capital of fortune , // this fame in advance , this success before succeeding , than General McClellan . That dear old domestic bird , the Public , which lays the golden eggs out of which greenbacks are hatched , was sure she had brooded out an eagle-chick at last . How we all waited to see him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation give such an example of faith and patience as while the Army of the Potomac lay during all those weary months before Washington . Every excuse was invented , every palliation suggested , except the true one , that our chicken was no eagle , after all . He was hardening his seres , he was waiting for his wings to grow , he was whetting his beak , we should see him soar at last and shake the thunder from his wings . But do what we could , hope what we might , it became daily clearer that , whatever other excellent qualities he might have , this of being aquiline was wanting . Disguise and soften it as we may , the campaign of the Peninsula was a disastrous failure , - a failure months long , like a bad novel in weekly instalments , with " To be continued " grimly ominous at the end of every part . So far was it from ending in the capture of Richmond , that nothing but the gallantry of General Pope and his little army hindered the Rebels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McClellan , and makes affidavit in one volume octavo that he is a great military genius , after all . It should seem that this genius is of two varieties . The first finds the enemy , and beats him ; the second finds him , and succeeds in getting away . General McClellan is now attempting a change of base in the face of public opinion , and is endeavoring to escape the consequences of having escaped from the Peninsula . For a year , his reputation flared upward like a rocket , culminated , burst , and now , after as long an interval , the burnt-out case comes down to us in this Report . There is something ludicrously tragic , as our politics are managed , in seeing an Administration compelled to print a campaign document ( for such is General McClellan 's Report in a double sense ) directed against itself . Yet in the present case , had it been possible to escape the penance , it had been unwise , for we think that no unprejudiced person can read the volume without a melancholy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more completely than the Rebels were able to do . He should have been more careful of his communications , for a line two hundred and forty-two pages long is likely to have its weak points . The volume before us is rather the plea of an advocate retained to defend the General 's professional character and expound his political opinions , than the curt , colorless , unimpassioned statement of facts which is usually so refreshing in the official papers of military men , and has much more the air of being addressed to a jury than to the War Department at Washington It is , in short , a letter to the people of the United States , under cover to the Secretary of War . General McClellan puts himself upon the country , and , after taking as much time to make up his mind as when he wearied and imperilled the nation in his camp on the Potomac , endeavors to win back from public opinion the victory which nothing but his own over-caution enabled the Rebels to snatch from him before Richmond . He can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but how nice it would be if we would give him back his reputation , which has never been of any great use to us , and yet would be so convenient for him ! It was made for him , and accordingly fits him better than it would any one else . But it is altogether too late . There is no argument for the soldier but success , no wisdom for the man but to acknowledge defeat and be silent under it . The Great Captain on his sofa at Longwood may demonstrate how the Russian expedition might , could , would , and should have ended otherwise ; but meanwhile its results are not to be reasoned with , - the Bourbons are at the Tuileries , and he at St. Helena . There is hardly anything that may not be made out of history by a skilful manipulator . Characters may be whitewashed , bigotry made over into zeal , timidity into prudence , want of conviction into toleration , obstinacy into firmness ; but the one thing that can not be theorized out of existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lost campaign . We have had other unsuccessful generals , but not one of them has ever been tempted into the indecorum of endeavoring to turn a defeat in the field to political advantage . Not one has thought of defending himself by imputations on his superiors . Early in the war General McDowell set an example of // GENERAL McCLELLAN 'S REPORT . April , silence under slanderous reproach , that won for him the sympathy and respect of whoever could be touched by self-reliant manliness . It is because General McClellan has seen fit to overstep the bounds of a proper official reserve , because , after more than a year for reflection , he has repeated charges of the grossest kind against those under whose orders he was acting , and all this from a political motive , that we think his Report deserving of more than usual attention . It will be no fault of his if he be not put in nomination for the Presidency , and accordingly it becomes worth our while to consider such evidences of character and capacity as his words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been ruined , like another general whose name began with Mac , by the " All hail hereafter " of certain political witches , who took his fortunes into their keeping after his campaign in Western Virginia . He had shown both ability and decision in handling a small force , and he might with experience have shown similar qualities in directing the operations of a great army , had not the promise of the Presidency made him responsible to other masters than military duty and unselfish patriotism . Thenceforward the soldier was lost in the politician . He thought more of the effect to be produced by his strategy on the voters behind him , than on the enemy in his front . What should have been his single object , - the suppression of the rebellion for the sake of the country ,  --  was now divided with the desire of merely ending it by some plan that should be wholly of his own contrivance , and should redound solely to his own credit and advancement . He became giddy and presumptuous , and lost that sense of present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirage that floated the White House before his eyes . At an age considerably beyond that of General Bonaparte when lie had triumphantly closed his first Italian campaign , he was nicknamed " the young Napoleon , " and from that time forth seems honestly to have endeavored , like Toepifer 's Albert , to resemble the ideal portrait which had been drawn for him by those who put him forward as their stalking-horse . And it must be admitted that these last managed matters cleverly , if a little coarsely . They went to work deliberately to Barnumize // their prospective candidate . No prima donna was ever more thoroughly exploited by her Hebrew impresario . The papers swarmed with anecdotes , incidents , sayings . Nothing was too unimportant , and the new Commander-in-chief pulled on his boots by telegram from Maine to California , and picked his teeth by special despatch to the Associated Press . We had him warm for supper in the very latest with three exclam*-tion-marks , and cold for breakfast in last evening 's telegraphic news with none . Nothing but a patent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from blaming General McClellan for all this . He probably looked upon it as one of the inevitable discomforts of distinction in America . But we think that it insensibly affected his judgment , led him to regard himself as the representative of certain opinions , rather than as a general whose whole duty was limited to the army under his command , and brought him at last to a temper of mind most unfortunate for the public interests , in which he could believe the administration personally hostile to himself because opposed to the political principles of those who wished to profit by his " availability . " It was only natural , too , that he should gradually come to think himself what his partisans constantly affirmed that he was , - the sole depositary of the country 's destiny . We form our judgment of General McClellau solely from his own Report ; we believe him to be honest in his opinions , and patriotic so far as those opinions will allow him to be ; we know him to be capable of attaching those about him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contempt they deserve the imputations on his courage and his military honor ; but at the same time we consider him a man like other men , with a head liable to be turned by a fame too easily won . His great misfortune was that he began his first important campaign with a reputation to save instead of to earn , so that he was hampered by the crowning disadvantage of age in a general without the experience which might neutralize it . Nay , what was still worse , he had two reputations to keep from damage , the one as soldier , the other as politician . He seems very early to have misapprehended the true relation in which he stood to the government . By the operation // of natural causes , as politicians would call them , lie had become heir presumptive to the chair of state , and felt called on to exert an influence on the policy of the war , or at least to express an opinion that might go upon record for future convenience . He plunged into that Dismal Swamp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalled at the outbreak of our rebellion , and from which every untrained explorer rises with a mouth too full of mud to be intelligible to Christian men . He appears to have thought it within the sphere of his duty to take charge of the statesmanship of the President no less than of the movements of the army , nor was it long before there were unmistakable symptoms that he began to consider himself quite as much the chief of an opposition who could dictate terms , as the military subordinate who was to obey orders . Whatever might have been his capacity as a soldier , this divided allegiance could not fail of disastrous consequences to the public service , for no mistress exacts so jealously the entire devotion of her servants as war . A mind distracted with calculations of future political contingencies was not to be relied on in the conduct of movements which above all others demand the constant presence , the undivided energy , of all the faculties , and the concentration of every personal interest on the one object of immediate success . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hundred and fifty thousand voters at his back , will be always weakened by those personal considerations which are the worst consequence of the elective system . General McClellan 's motions were encumbered in every direction by a huge train of political baggage . This misconception of his own position , or rather his confounding the two characters of possible candi* date and actual general , forced the growth of whatever egotism was latent in his nature . He began erelong to look at everything from a personal point of view , to judge men and measures by their presumed relation to his own interests , and at length fairly persuaded himself that the inevitable results of his own want of initiative were due to the hostile combination against him of Mr. Lincoln , Mr. Stanton , and General Halleck . Regarding himself too much in considering the advantages of success , he regards others too little in awarding the responsibility of faHure. // The intense self-consciousness of General McClellan , and a certain aim at effect for ulterior and unmilitary purposes. , show themselves early . In October , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of War , he does not forget the important constituency of Bunkum . " The unity of this nation , " he says , " the preservation of our institutions , are so dear to me , that I have willingly sacrificed my private happiness with the single object of doing my duty to my coun try . When the task is accomplished , I shall be glad to retire to the obscurity from which events have drawn me . Whatever the determination of the government may be , I will do the best I can with the Army of the Potomac , and will share its fate , whatever may be the task imposed upon me . " Not to speak of taste , the utter blindness to the true relations of things shown in such language is startling . What sacrifice had General McClellan made which had not been equally made by every one of the hundred and fifty thousand men of his army ? Educated at the expense of the country , his services were a debt due on demand . And what was the sacrifice of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the management of a railway to one of the most conspicuous and inspiring positions of modern times , to an opportunity such as comes rarely to any man , and then only as the reward of transcendent ability transcendently displayed ! To step from a captaincy of engineers to the command in chief of a great nation on fire with angry enthusiasm , spendthrift of men , money , devotion , to be the chosen champion of order , freedom , and civilization , - this is indeed a sacrifice such as few men have been called upon to make by their native land ! And of what is General McClellan thinking when he talks of returning to obscurity ? Of what are men commonly thinking when they talk thus ? The newspapers would soon grow rich , if everybody should take to advertising what he did not want . And , moreover , to what kind of obscurity can a successful general return ? An obscurity made up of the gratitude and admiration of his countrymen , a strange obscurity of glory ! Nor is this the only occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fate of his army . What corporal could do less ? No man thoroughly in earnest , and with the fate of his country in his // hands and no thought but of that , could have any place in his mind for such footlight phrases as these . General McClellan 's theory from the first seems to have been , that a large army would make a great general , though all history shows that the genius , decision , and confidence of a leader are the most powerful reinforcement of the troops under his command , and that an able captain makes a small army powerful by recruiting it with his own vigor and enthusiasm . From the time of his taking the command till his removal , he was constantly asking for more men , constantly receiving them , and constantly unable to begin anything with them after he got them . He could not move without one hundred and fifty thousand pairs of legs , and when his force had long reached that number , the President was obliged by the overtaxed impatience of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a special order . What the army really needed was an addition of one man , and that at the head of it ; for a general , like an orator , must be moved himself before he can move others . The larger his army , the more helpless was General McClellan . Like the magician 's fanzulus , who rashly undertook to play the part of master , and who could evoke powers that he could not control , he was swamped in his own supplies . With every reinforcement sent him on the Peninsula , his estimate of the numbers opposed to him increased . His own imagination faced him in superior numbers at every turn . Since Don Quixote 's enumeration of the armies of the Emperor Ahifanfaron and King Pentapohin of the Naked Arm , there has been nothing like our General* s vision of the Rebel forces , with their ever-lengthening list of leaders , gathered for the defence of Richmond . His anxiety swells their muster-roll at last to two hundred thousand . We say his anxiety , for no man of ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebel leaders would not have divided their forces , with one army occupying General McClellan , while they attempted the capital he had left uncovered with the other . The first plan proposed by General McClellan covered operations extending from Virginia to Texas . With a main army of two hundred and seventy-three thousand he proposes , " not // only to drive the enemy out of Virginia and occupy Richmond , but to occupy Charleston , Savannah , Montgomery , Pensacola , Mobile , and New Orleans ; in other words , to move into the heart of the enemy 's country and crush the rebellion in its very heart . " We do not say that General McClellan 's ambition to be the one man who should crush the rebellion was an unworthy one , but that his theory that this was possible , and in the way he proposed , shows him better fitted to state the abstract problems than to apprehend the complex details of their solution when they lie before him as practical difficulties . For when we consider the necessary detachments from this force to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wishes the President to do , in order to justify the largeness of the force required , we can not help asking how SOOLl the army for active operations would be reduced to a hundred and fifty thousand . And how long would a general be in reaching New Orleans , if he is six months in making up his mind to advance with an army of that strength on the insignificant fortifications of Manassas , manned , according to the best information , with forty thousand troops ? At the same time General McClellan assigns twenty thousand as a force adequate for opening the Mississippi . This plan , to be sure , was soon abandoned , but it is an illustration of the want of precision and forethought which characterizes the mind of its author . A man so vague in his conceptions is apt to be timid in action , for the same haziness of mind may , according to circumstances , either soften and obscure the objects of thought , or make them loom with purely fantastic exaggeration . There is a vast difference between clearness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abstract schemes of action , beautiful in their correctness of outline and apparent simplicity . It is a perception of this truth , we believe , which leads practical men always to suspect plans supported by statistics too exquisitely conclusive . It was on precisely such a specious basis of definite misinforination that General McClellan 's next proposal for the campaign by way of the Peninsula rested , - precise facts before he sets out turning to something like precise no-facts when he gets there , - beautiful completeness of conception ending in hesita // tion , confusion , and failure . Before starting , " the roads are passable at all seasons of the year , the country much more favorable for offensive operations than that in front of Washington , much more level , the woods less dense , the soil more sandy . " ( p. 47 . ) After arriviiig , we find " the roads impassable , " " very dense and extensive forests , the clearings being small and few " ; and " the comparative flatness of the country and the alertness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dangerous , and difficult . " ( p. 79 . ) General McClellan 's mental constitution would seem to be one of those , easily elated and easily depressed , that exaggerate distant advantages and dangers near at hand , - minds stronger in conception than perception , and accordingly , as such always are , wanting that faculty of swift decision which , catching inspiration from danger , makes opportunity success . Add to this a kind of adhesiveness ( we can hardly call it obstinacy or pertinacity ) of temper , which can make no allowance for change of circumstances , and we think we have a tolerably clear notion of the causes of General McClellan 's disasters . He can compose a good campaign beforehand , but lie can not improvise one out of the events of the moment , as is the wont 9f great generals . Occasion seldom offers her forelock twice to the grasp of the same man , and yet General McClellan , by the admission of the Rebels themselves , had Richmond at his mercy more than once . He seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDowell 's division , and its consequent failure to co-operate with his own forces . But the fact is patent that the campaign was lost by his sitting down in front of Yorktown , and wasting a whole month in a series of approaches whose scientific propriety would have delighted Uncle Toby , to reduce a garrison of eight thousand men . Without that delay , which gave the Rebels time to send Jackson into the Shenandoah valley , General McDowell 's army would have been enabled to come to his assistance . General McClellan , it is true , complains that it was not sent round by water , as he wished ; but even if it had been , it could only have been an addition of helplessness to an army already too unwieldy for its commander ; for he really made the Rebel force double his own // ( as he always fancied it ) by never bringing more than a quarter of his army into action at once . Yet during the whole campaign he was calling for more men , and getting them , *till his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When every available man , and more , had been sent him , he writes from Harrison 's Bar to Mr. Stanton , " To accomplish the great task of capturing Richmond and putting an end to this rebellion , reinforcements should be sent to me rather much over than less than one hundred thousand men . " This letter General McClellan has not seen fit to include in his Report . Was the government to be blamed for pouring no more water into a sieve like this ? It certainly was a great mistake on Mr. Lincoln 's part to order General McDowell off on a wild-goose chase after Jackson . The co-operation of this force might have enabled General McClellan even then to retrieve his campaign , and we do not in the least blame him for feeling bitterly the disappointment of wanting it . But it seems to us that it was mainly his own fault that there was anything to retrieve , and the true occasion to recover his lost ground was offered him after his bloody repulse of the enemy at Malvern Hill , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retreat we think he would deserve all credit , had he not been under the necessity of making it . It was conducted with great judgment and ability , and we do not love that partisan narrowness of mind that would . grudge him the praise so fairly earned . But at the same time it is not ungenerous to say , that the obstinate valOr shown by his army under all the depression of a backward movement , while it proves how much General McClellan had done to make it an effective force , makes us regret all the more that he should have wanted the decision to try its quality under the inspiration of attack . It is impossible that the spirit of the army should not have been affected by the doubt and indecision of their general . They fought nobly , but they were always on the defensive . Had General McClellan pat them at once on the aggressive , we believe his campaign would have been a triumphant one . With truly great generals resolve is instinctive , a deduction from premises supplied by the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science of their achieve // ments afterwards , like the mathematical law in the Greek column . The stiffness rather than firmness of mind , the surrender of all spontaiieous action in the strait-waistcoat of a preconceived plan , to which we have before alluded , unfitted him for that rapid change of combinations on the great chessboard of battle which enabled General Rosecrans at Murfreesboro to turn defeat into victory , an achievement without parallel in the history of the war . General McClellan seems to have considered the President too careful of the safety of the capital ; but he should measure the value of Washington by what lie himself thought of the importance of taking Richmond . That , no doubt , would be a great advaiitage , but the loss of a recognized seat of government , with its diplomatic and other traditions , would have been of vastly more fatal consequence to us than the capture of their provisional perch in Virginia would have been to the Rebel authorities . It would have brought foreign recognition to the Rebels , and thrown Maryland certainly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as we held Washington , we had on our side the two powerful sentiments of permanence and tradition , some insensible portions of which the Rebels were winning from us with every day of repose allowed them by General McClellan . It was a clear sense of this that both excited and justified the impatience of the people , who saw that the insurrection was gaining the coherence and prestige of an established power , - an element of much strength at home and abroad . That this popular instinct was not at fault , we have the witness of General Kirby Smith , who told Colonel Fremantle " that McClellan might probably have destroyed the Southern army with the greatest ease during the first winter , and without much risk to himself , as the Southerners were so much over-elated by their easy triumph at Manassas , and their army had dwindled away . " We have said that General McClellan 's volume is rather a plea in abatement of judgment than a report . It was perfectly proper that he should endeavor to put everything in its true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all right-minded men in so doing ; but an ex parte statement at once rouses and justifies adverse criticism . He has omitted many docu // ments essential to the formation of a just opinion ; and it is only when we have read these also , in the Report of the Committee on the Conduct of the War , that we feel the full weight of the cumulative evidence going to show the hearty support in men and confidence that he received from the Administration , and , when there were no more men to he sent , and confidence began to yield before irresistible facts , the prolonged forbearance with which he was still favored . Nothing can be kinder or more cordial than the despatches and letters both of the President and Mr. Stanton , down to the time when General McClellan wrote the following sentences at the end of an official communication addressed to the latter : " If I save this army now , I tell you plainly that I owe no thanks to you , or to any other persons in Washington . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 28th June , 1862 . ) We shall seek no epithet to characterize language like this . All but the most bigoted partisans will qualify it as it deserves . We have here a glaring example of that warping of good sense and good feeling which the consciousness of having a political stake at risk will produce in a gallant soldier and a courteous gentleman . Can General McClellan , after a year to grow cool in , either himself believe , or expect any one else to believe , that the President and the Secretary of War would " do their best to sacrifice " an army of a hundred and fifty thousand brave men , in order to lessen his possible chances as a candidate for the Presidency ? It was of vastly more importance to them than to him that he should succeed . The dignified good temper of Mr. Lincoln 's answer to this wanton insult does him honor . " I have not said you were ungenerous for saying you needed reinforcements ; I thonght you were ungenerous iii assuming that I did not send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misfortune to you and your army quite as keenly as you feel it yourself . " Mr. Stanton could only be silent ; and whatever criticisms may be made on some traits of his character , he is quite safe in leaving the rebuke of such an imputation to whoever feels that earnestness , devotion , and unflagging purpose are high qualities in a public officer . If General McClellan had been as prompt in attacking the enemy as the showed himself in this assault on his superiors , // we think his campaign in the Peninsula would have ended more satisfactorily . We have no doubt that he would conduct a siege or a defence with all the science and all the proprieties of warfare , but we think he has proved himself singularly wanting in the qualities which distinguish the natural leaders of men . He had every theoretic qualification , but no ardor , no leap , no inspiration . A defensive general is an earthen redoubt , not an ensign to rally enthusiasm and inspire devotion . Caution will never make an army , though it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and lowered the tone of his soldiers by his six months ' dose of prudence . With every day he gave the enemy , he lessened his chances of success , and added months to the duration of the war . He never knew how to find opportunity , much less to make it . He was an accomplished soldier , but lacked that downright common-sense which is only another name for genius with its coat off for actual work in hand . Were General McClellan 's Report nothing more than a report , were the General himself nothing more than an officer endeavoring to palliate a failure , we should not have felt called on to notice his plea , unless to add publicity to any new facts he might be able to bring forward . But the Report is a political manifesto , and not only that , but an attack on the Administration which appointed him to the command , supported him with all its resources , and whose only fault it was not sooner to discover his incapacity to conduct aggressive movements . General McClellan is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no opportunity to show his capacity in any civil function , his claim must rest on one of two grounds , - either the ability he has shown as a general , or the specific principles of policy he is supposed to represent . Whatever may be the success of our operations in the field , our Chief Magistracy for the next four years will demand a person of great experience and ability . Questions can not fail to arise taxing prudeiice of the longest forecast and decision of the firmest quality . How far is General McClellan likely to fulfil these conditions ? What are the qualities of mind of which both his career and his Report give the most irrefragable evidence ? General McClellan 's mind seems to be equally incapable of // appreciating the value of time as the material of action , and its power in changing the relations of facts , and thus modifying the basis of opinion . He is a good maker of almanacs , but no good judge of the weather . Judging by the political counsel which lie more than once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as lie has included it in his Report , we must presume to represent his present opinions , he does not seem even yet to appreciate the fact , that this is not a war between two nations , but an attempt at revolution within ourselves , which can be adequately met only by revolutionary measures . And yet , if he were at this moment elevated to the conduct of our affairs , he would find himself controlled by the same necessities which have guided Mr. Lincoln , and must either adopt his measures , or submit to a peace dictated by the South . No side issue as to how the war shall be conducted is any longer possible . The naked question is one of war or submission , for compromise means surrender ; and if the choice be war , we can not afford to give the enemy fifty in the game , by standing upon scruples which he would be the last to appreciate or to act upon . It is one of the most terrible features of war , that it must be inexorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been more than once shown by the same man , and naturally enough , because they both result from the same qualities of mind , an instant apprehension of the demand of the moment , and a selfcoiifidence that can as instantly meet it , so that every energy of the man is gathered to one intense focus . It is the faculty of being a present man , instead of a prospective one ; of being ready , instead of getting ready . Though we think great injustice has been done by the public to General McClellan 's really high merits as an officer , yet it seems to us that those very merits show precisely the character of intellect to unfit him for the task just now demanded of a statesman . His capacity for organization may be conspicuous ; but , be it what it may , it is one thing to bring order out of the confusion of mere inexperience , and quite another to retrieve it from a chaos of elements mutually hostile , which is the problem sure to present itself to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nail , and not to be drawn for at three days ' sight , of which General McClellan has shown least , // Is our path to be so smooth for the next four years , that a man whose leading characteristic is an exaggeration of difficulties is likely to be our surest guide ? If the war is still to be carried on , and surely the nation has shown no symptoms of slackening in its purpose , what modifications of it would General McClellan introduce ? The only information that is vouchsafed us is , that he is to be the " conservative " candidate , a phrase that may mean too little or too much . As well as we can understand it , it is the convenient formula by which to express the average want of opinions of all who are out of place , out of humor , or dislike the dust which blinds and chokes whoever is behind the times . Sometimes it is used as the rallying-cry of an amiable class of men , who still believe , in a vague sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offering them a ruler more comme ii faut than Mr. Lincoln , a country where a flatboatman may rise to the top , by virtue of mere manhood , being hardly the place for people of truly refined sensibilities . Or does it really mean nothing more nor less than that we are to try and put slavery back again where it was before , ( only that it is not quite convenient just now to say so , ) on the theory that teleologically the pot of ointment was made to conserve the dead fly ? In the providence of God the first thoughtless enthusiasm of the nation has settled to deep purpose , their anger has been purified by trial into a conviction of duty , and they are face to face with one of those rare occasions where duty and advantage are identical . The man who is fit for the office of President in these times should be one who knows how to advance , an art which General McClellan has never learned . He must be one who comprehends that three years of war have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be one who feels to the very marrow of his bones that this is a war , not to conserve the forms , but the essence , of free institutions . He must be willing to sacrifice everything to the single consideration of success , because success means truth and honor , to use every means , though they may alarm the fears of men who are loyal with a reservation , or shock the prejudices of wouldbe traitors . No middle course is safe in troubled times , and the only way to escape the dangers of revolution is by directing its forces and giving it useful work to do .
