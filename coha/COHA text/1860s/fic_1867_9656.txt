The shearers are here at work , and that was the reason , I felt so sure you would come . I knew the Virgin could bring you in time for mass in the chapel on the first morning . Father .

Margarita Oh , that is the worst of it ! ( Sobs ) If it were not for that I would not be so afraid . If it happened any other way she might have forgiven me , but she never will .

Margarita ( Looking up for the first time ) Oh , the Saints bless you ! Do you really think you can mend it . Senorita ?

Ra . Ramona In the artichoke patch ! How under heavens did it get there ? Mar . Margarita Oh , that is what I meant when I said she 'd never forgive me . She has forbidden me to hang anything on the fence to dry there , and if I 'd done as she told me , and washed it two days ago , all would have been well . But I forgot it till to-day , and you know how the sun lies on the artichoke patch , and I thought it 'd dry quickly there . I did n't leave it more than half an hour . Ra . Ramona ( Smoothing it out ) Its not so bad as it looks . I 'll do it the best I can , and then , after the Father has gone , I can repair it at leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will not show for to-morrow Mar . Margarita Will the Senora know ? Ra .

" Ales . comes forward , Father Sal . also Ales . Alessandro Father , since the Mexican war , the Americans say we have no right to our lands . Do you think that can be so , when we have always lived on them , and the owners promised them to us forever ? Anxiously watching the Father 's face Father Sal . Father Salvierderra ( hesitating ) Got your father any notice at anytime since the Americans took the country  --  notice to appear before a court , or anything about a title to the lands ? Ales . Alessandro No , Father . Father Sal . Father Salvierderra There has to be some such papers , as I understand their laws ; some notice before any steps can be taken to remove Indians from an estate . It must be done according to the law in the courts . If you have had no such notice , you are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how could there be a law to take away from us the land which the Senor Valdez gave us forever ? Father Sal . Father Salvierderra Gave he to you any paper  --  any writing to show it ? Ales . Alessandro No , no paper ; but it is marked in red lines on the map . They measured it off with instruments , and I saw them mark it on the map , and my father understood it . The Senor pointed to it with his finger and said . " All this is your land , Pablo , always . " I do not think my father need fear for Temecula , do you ? Father Sal . Father Salvierderra ( Cautiously ) I hope not , but I have small faith in the honesty of the Americans . I think they will take all they can . The Church has suffered terrible loss at their hands . They possess the country and can make what laws they please ; we can only say , " God 's will be done , ( crosses himself ) God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can it be God 's will that one man should steal from another all he has ?

E. Enter Mar . L Mar . Margarita ( looking after Ales . ) Pshaw ! he 's gone . I can never get a word with him , but the Senorita must come and call him away , and he flies , as if he was shot on an arrow , at her first word . My ! but things are changed here ,  --  and for the better . Alessandro makes a better shepherd than old Juan Can , if Senor Felipe ' d only see it , and I guess he will . Now , if the Senorita would marry Senor Felipe  --  he worships the ground she walks on ; anybody with a quarter of a blind eye can see that ;  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the Senora 's word is law here . Alessandro was fond of me last year ; its because he 's so put up by everybody now , that he 's change . If I could only get a half-hour with him alone , I 'm not afraid after that The Senorita is fond of him , herself , if only the fool had eyes to see it . ( mockingly ) " It is n't well to speak thus freely to young men , Margarita . " Oh , I 'll get even with her ! If I could only come on them of a sudden , and say to her as she said to me , " You are wanted in the house , " oh ! it would do my soul good . I 'd say it so it would sting like a lash laid on both their faces . It will come ; it will come . She 'll be caught one of these fine times . Enter Luigo R Luigo . Margarita !

Ramona Neither Alessandro nor I have done anything wrong , and we were not ashamed . We love each other , and we are going to be married and go away . We had only just spoken of being married when you found us . Sen. Senora ( amazed ) Marry ! Marry that Indian ! You marry an Indian ? Never ! Are you mad ? I will never permit it . Ra .

These were her final instructions to me in regard to the disposition to be made of the property she left you . ( reads ) " All my property and jewels are to be given to my adopted daughter , Ramona Ortegna , on her wedding day , if she weds worthily and with your approval . Should such a misfortune occur , which I do not anticipate , as that she should prove unworthy , then all I have left to her shall be the property of the Church .

Ra . Ramona ( springs to her feet , her eyes flashing ) Yes , Senora Moreno , the Indian blood in my veins shows , to-day . I understand many things now I never understood before . Was it because I was an Indian that you have always hated me ? Sen. Senora You are not an Indian , and I have never hated you . Ra .

Senora ( angrily ) Enough ! ( looks sternly at Felipe ) Felipe . ( amazed ) Why do you look at me like that , mother ? What have I done ? Sen. Senora ( rising and waving hand imperiously ) Enough ! Do not say any more . I wish to think for a few moments . ( walks about ) Felipe . ( aside ) Poor little one ! If my mother looked at her as she did at me just now , I wonder she did not die . Sen. Senora ( aside ) As if I had not suffered enough by reason of that creature , without her coming between me and Felipe . I knew in the beginning no good would come of taking that girt . Well , I suppose I may be grateful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prey . No , she shall not come between me and my son ! ( goes to Felipe and puts her arms around his neck ) Forgive me , my child ! I had not thought anything could make me angry with you . That shameless creature is costing us dear ! She must leave the house ! Felipe . I do not see why you call her shameless . There is nothing wrong in her loving Alessandro . Sen. Senora ( standing erect ) I found her in his arms . Felipe . I know . Alessandro told me that he had just at that instant , told her he loved her , and she said she loved him , and would marry him , just as you came up . Sen. Senora ( taking seat beside Felipe ) Humph ! I do n't blame him ; it 's all Ramona 's fault . Felipe . Mother , I ca n't bear you to say such things of Ramona . You know it is false ! I ca n't help it if I make you very angry . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married , and I think we ought to let them live here . You know , mother , it is n't as if Ramona really belonged to our family . You know she is half Indian . Sen. Senora Ugh ! Felipe . I have often thought about Ramona 's future . You know a great many men would not want to marry her just on that account . You , yourself , would never have given your consent to my marrying her , if I had wanted to . Sen. Senora ( in horror ) Oh !  --  Felipe . No , of course not ; I always knew that ; except for that , I might have loved her myself , far a sweeter girl never drew breath on this God 's earth . You have never loved her ;  --  I do n't think you have even liked her . I watched her all summer , when I lay there sick . I watched Alessandro , too , and saw they loved each other , and I do nt believe Alessandro ever said or did a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe Ramona has ever looked , said or done a thing I would not be willing to have my own sister do . Sen. Senora ( slowly eyeing him ) Would you be willing that your own sister should marry Alessandro ? ( Felipe pauses ) Would you be willing that your sister should marry Alessandro ? Felipe . No , mother , I should not ; but  --  Sen. Senora Never mind buts . Of course , I knew you could make but one answer to my question ; of course , it is not right for you to allow her to do what you would not allow your own sister to do . Felipe . No , mother . I suppose not ; but  --  Sen. Senora I was sure my own son could make no other reply . Very well ; then we will discuss this no further , at present . We will send her away for a time , till she gets over it . What do you think of sending her to the Sisters ? Felipe . ( amazed ) Mother ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not shut the poor girl up in a convent ! Sen. Senora ( lifting eyebrows in surprise ) Who spoke of shutting up ? She might go there to school . She is not too old to learn . Can you advise anything better ? Felipe . ( excited walks about ) Advise ! Advise !  --  Why let her marry him ; let her go away , if she wants to . Sen. Senora Without our consent ? Felipe . Yes , let her go ;  --  only it 's cruel to treat her so , turn her out of the house ! L. F Enter Ra. door L. cautiously crosses to R Sen. Senora ( rising ) Turn her out ?  --  certainly not .

The Senora says she will shut me up in a convent . Oh , Alessandro , take me with you ! Ales . Alessandro I will take you , my Senorita . Perhaps the saints will have mercy on you , even if they have forsaken my people . Ra . Ramona Your people are my people , and the saints never forsake anyone who does not forsake them .

I have seen the white men riding up and down in the valley , and I found some of their cursed bits of wood , with figures on them , set up on my land , the other day , and I pulled them up and burned them to ashes . Oh , Majella , I knew our happiness could not last ! Even after the long struggle we had to get here ,  --  here among our own people  --  there is no rest . We can have no rest ! Ysidro went to rather Gaspara for help about his land , but it did no good . They said the land did not belong to him , at all , but to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morong , and paid the money for it , and there would very soon come papers from Washington to show that it was his . Father Gaspara went with Ysidro to a lawyer , in San Diego , and had shown to this lawyer Ysidro 's paper ,  --  the one from the Mexican Governor of California , establishing the pueblo of San Pasquale , and saying how many leagues of land the Indians were to have ,  --  but the lawyer laughed at Father Gaspara for believing that such a paper as that was good for anything . He said that was all very well when the country belonged to Mexico , but it was no good now ; that the Americans owned it now ; and everything was done by the American law now  --  not by the Mexican law any more .

We can do nothing , any more than the wild beasts ; they are better than we . My father knew it , and he said it was no use to fight . He said the Indians were crazy to fight ; it was no use . They would be killed themselves ; that is the worst of it , my Majella . The stupid Indians fight and kill , and then what can we do ? or , these lazy , shiftless tribes are taken to represent us all . The white men think we are all the same . Ra . Ramona But the white men are not so good . They commit any crime  --  even murder for gold . Every day we hear of such cases .

For money !  --  Bah ! Majella , they are dogs ! Ra . Ramona But they can not all be so bad , I think , Alessandro . There must be some that are honest ; do you not think so ? Ales . Alessandro ( fiercely ) Where are they , then ;  --  the ones who are good ? Among my people there are always some that are bad ; but they are in disgrace . My father punished them ; the whole people punished them . If there are Americans who are good ; who will not cheat and kill , why do they not send after these robbers and punish them ? And how is it , they make laws which cheat ? It was the American law which took Temecula away from us and gave it to those men . The law was on the side of thieves . No , Majella , it is a people that steals and kills for money ! My people do not steal . There was never but one thief in our village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away and never came back . I heard he went to another village , and was a thief in spite of all his whipping . I think if it is in the blood to be a thief , not even whipping will take it out , Majella . Ra .

Ramona But , Alessandro , if you could go to the place where the Government officer , and find out about the new laws in regard to land . Ales . Alessandro ( laughing ) What more is there to learn ?

I did not wait for the Americans to sell them for me and take the money ; it 's not much , but it 's better than nothing .

Alessandro Yes , I see , Senor ; I am not surprised ; I knew it would come . I will not give you any trouble , Senor , because I can not . If I could I would . But I have heard all about the new law which gives all the Indians ' lands to the Americans . We can not help ourselves . But it is very hard , Senor .

The whites think they 'd get rich if they could only get the red devils out of the way ;  --  that 's what they say . I 'm sorry for it , but you see I 've got my family in San Diego , and I want to get them settled as soon as I can . My wife wo n't feel comfortable till she 's in her own house . We 're from the States , and she 's been used to having everything comfortable . Ales . Alessandro I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfortable here .

There will be three hundred dollars worth of wheat in July , Senor ;  --  you can see for yourself  --  and a house as good as this , you can not build for less than one hundred dollars . What will you give me for them ? Amer. ( insolently ) I suppose I can have them without paying you for them , if I choose . Ales . Alessandro No , Senor ! Amer. ( sneering ) What 's to hinder , then , I 'd like to know ! You have n't got any rights here , whatever , according to law . Ales . Alessandro ( calmly ) I shall hinder , Senor . I shall burn down all the sheds and corrals , tear down the house , and before a blade of wheat is reaped , I will burn that . Amer. ( sullenly ) What 'll you take ? Ales .

The plough you may have ; that is worth twenty . Amer . I 'll do it . aside I need n't do it . Injuns have n't got any rights .

You could get work there . I could get some sewing to do , too . It would be better , I think . Ales . Alessandro Go live among white people ! What does Majella think would become of one Indian , or two , alone among whites ? If they will come to our villages and drive us out one hundred at a time , what would they do to one alone ? Oh , Majella is foolish ! Ra . Ramona But there are many of your people at work for whites at Los Angelos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they do ? Ales . Alessandro ( bitterly ) Yes ; at work for whites ; so they are Majella has not seen . No man will pay an Indian but half wages . They pay the Indian in money , sometimes , half wages ; sometimes in bad flour , or things he does not want ; sometimes in whiskey ; and if he asks for money , they laugh , and tell him to go , then . One man in San Bernardino , last year , when an Indian would not take a bottle of sour wine for pay , for a day 's work , shot him in the cheek with his pistol , and told him to mind how he was insolent any more . Oh , Majella , do not ask me to go to work in the towns ! I should kill some man , Majella , if I saw things like that . Ra. shudders and looks intently at Alessandro None of the villages are safe .

I was going to have the man arrested , but they said it would be folly to bring the case to trial . The law permits men to kill horse-thieves , and he told a straight story . The woman 's testimony would not be believed . And even if the case had been brought to a jury trial , the result would have been the same ; for there would never have been found a San Diego county jury that would convict a white man of murder for killing an Indian .

That 's so . I 've been trying to break up this vile business of selling whiskey to Indians . It is no use trying to do anything for them while they are made drunk in this way ; it 's a sin and a shame ! Aunt Ri . Thet 's so , I allow ter yeou . Thar ai nt enny gain-sayin ' thet . But ef yeou 've got power ter git a man put in jail fur sellin ' whiskey t ' ' n Injun , ' n haint got power ter git him punished ef he goes ' n kills thet Injun , ' t seems ter me thar 's suthin ' cur'us abaout thet .
