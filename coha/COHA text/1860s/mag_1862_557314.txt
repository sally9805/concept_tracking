txt ART . XI . - Considerations on some of the Elements and Conditions of Social Welfare and Human Progress . Being Academic and Occasional Discourses and other Papers . By C. S. HENRY , P. D. New York : D. Appleton &amp; Co. 1861. l2mo. pp. 415 . THIS volume is a contribution to that department of literature to which our habits and institutions have given a peculiar value ; we mean those detached essays and discourses which are exacted from all of our prominent men of letters , as contributors to periodicals , or at the anniversary celebrations of literary societies . There is no way in which these men are brought so directly into contact with the public mind , or enabled to minister more effectively to the wants of young and active intellects . The reader welcomes his review or magazine as the visit of a friend , who comes at stated intervals to help him through a leisure hour , and to tell him what the world beyond his immediate circle is talking about and doing ; and suspends , often , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with that of a professional guide . The listener comes prepared to be pleased , and lends his ear under the unconscious influence of that gentle yet powerful excitement which human beings exercise upon one another when brought together by a common purpose and directing their attention to a common object . The speaker takes advantage of the attention which he knows he may count upon , to enforce some important truth , or awaken an interest in some favorite speculation . And the frequent recurrence of these occasions has // gradually built up a peculiar form of literature , in which some of our most brilliant minds have won their most brilliant triumphs . In form and purpose these productions belong to the lighter literature of the day , their immediate object being to fill up a leisure hour agreeably , and their chief merit a graceful diction set off by a graceful delivery . Hence , out of the abundance which every twelvemonth brings forth , few are known beyond the circle for which they were produced , and fewer still outlive the year of their birth . Listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they linger for a while on the centre-table , supply the materials for a few kind notices from friendly newspapers and reviews , and then slide into the cobwebbed corner , or drop noiselessly into the dusty receptacle in which the productions of rival wits , like the ashes of rival statesmen in Westminster Abbey , sleep peacefully side by side . This , however , is but one view of the subject , and would give , if we were to stop here , a very erroneous impression of our estimate of these productions . Differing , as they necessarily do , in literary merit , and still more in merit of thought , they all have their origin in a common demand for intellectual entertainment , and thus afford , within certain limits , a standard for the appreciation of the intellect by which that demand is made . Men who undertake to please an audience will take care to select subjects within the comprehension of that audience . Men who endeavor to enforce a truth will make sure that their hearers already know enough about it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the successful writer , is always more or less in harmony with the minds of his contemporaries . If he teaches , it is from an elevation to which they can look up without straining their eyes . If he exhorts , it is by appealing to feelings and convictions which they hold in common with him . Even where he goes beyond them , opening new paths and letting in the remoter landscape through new vistas , he starts from some spot on which they can all stand together , and take in a common view . Thus , these occasional essays - emanating from a great variety of independent sources , coming , some from a law-office , with its // atmosphere of briefs and writs and affidavits , some from the doctor 's office , and wrought painfully out with memories of sick-rooms and death-beds thrusting themselves in between the paragraphs , some from the clergyman 's study , some from the teacher 's overwrought brain , and a few from the retreats of elegant leisure-agree when taken collectively , as expressions of wants and feelings common to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are prepared . For the historian , therefore , they possess a peculiar interest , - an interest altogether independent of their individual value , and founded solely upon their relation to the general mind . They are the language of one comprehensive class to another class still more comprehensive . They are the words of men who have gone out into the world and begun to prove it , to younger men who are still standing upon the threshold , with minds undecided and a path to choose . Hence these words must be about things in which they can all feel a common interest , - hopes which experience has chastened , aspirations which trial has curbed , thoughts that have grown into convictions , and opinions that have been tested by opposition . They are transcripts of the speaker 's mind , and mirrors of the minds to which he speaks , - retrospects for the one , a future for the other , equally of momentous concern to both . In some we find the germs of important truths which may give their coloring to a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which , falling upon the healthy mind at the right moment , stir it up to hopeful exertion . When the speaker looks around him upon familiar scenes , dimmed somewhat , and obscured by unfamiliar faces , he feels that one of the decisive rounds is already run , and that it is good for him to come back again to the starting-point , and renew his strength before he returns to the race . And the hearer listens with the feelings of one who is girding himself up for the contest and looking anxiously about him for the means and the chances of victory . The speaker of this year was the listener of five years ago . The listener of to-day may be called back in a few years to offer the fruits of his own experience to the listeners of a new generation . Thus from year to year the same round is run , the same solemnities repeated , and the // same order of thought and eloquence sent forth upon the beaten track , over which so large a portion of the productions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printing-press to the trunk-makers . It would be a curious study to divide the brief history of our literature into periods of ten or fifteen years , and , analyzing the literary discourses of each period , to compare the results both in substance and in form . We should find in it , if we are not very much mistaken , a striking illustration of that remarkable harmony which , even under the most unfavorable circumstances , is always found to exist between the world of thought and the world of action . It would be seen , that some ideas were expressed in words before they were expressed in deeds ; that others were little else than the summing up of general facts ; - that in some instances the impulse had been given ; *n some it had been received ; but that in all , the general tone of thought as written out accorded wonderfully with the general tone of thought as acted out . Some new suggestion is made in education , and a dozen new schools spring up to test it . The writer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the indications of a great movement of the public mind ; and , tracing it up to its source , attempts to point out its tendency and foretell its results . A succession of prosperous years gives a new impulse to industry and material growth . Thought seizes upon the favorable moment , and sets up her own claims to a share of the blessing . It will be seen , too , that the characteristics of each period , although near the boundary-lines they seem to run into each other , are still clear and well defined . Woe to the unlucky orator who , living amidst his own thoughts in the seclusion of some country village , attempts to excite the enthusiasm of the audience of to-day by the same means that excited the audiences of ten years ago . The jest has grown stale , the illustrations are worn threadbare ; his choicest rhetoric , which made his own veins tingle as he wrote , hardly keeps the eyes open . The world has been moving ; and he who would speak to it and be heard must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves , to every great truth , every sincere conviction , every tie which connects the present with the past , and helps // to preserve the identity of the species through all the transformations of the individual . It has been said , that every man of imagination preserves through life a vivid recollection of his first sight of the stage . It may be said with equal truth , that every American who passes through college distinctly remembers , long after every text-book has been forgotten , the first oration before his " own** society . For our own part , we remember ours as well as if it were but of yesterday ; and yet the orator and full half of those who shared the triumph of the day with us are in their graves . We called ourselves " Brothers , " - " United Brothers , " - and wore a little silver medal , with two clasped hands engraved upon it , as the emblem of our brotherhood . Our gathering-place was the library , a middle-sized , square room in the fourth story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ranged around the walls , in glass cases . In the very next room were our rivals , the Philermenians , with as many books and as good scholars as we , - formidable rivals , sometimes pushing us hard to the wall , especially through the first six months of the collegiate year , when new members were to be chosen , and the electioneering skill of the old hands to be tried upon innocent Freshmen . Out of our bitter feuds and manifold contentions another society had sprung up , under the happy auspices of Franklin 's name , threatening for a while , in the exuberance of its youthful strength , to outstrip us both , but suddenly falling in the height of its exultation , as they who use their youthful* strength too freely are apt to do . The hardest fighting was over the choice of an orator for the day before Commencement . He was to be a graduate , . of course , and custom required that he should be one of our own men . But pride , or vanity , - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattering appellation , - required , also , that he shoul&amp; be a man of some note , one who had written a book , or made a speech , or done something to be talked about , - conditions not always fulfilled by the Brothers who had gone before us ; : and therefore we sometimes cast our nets outside of the circle , and tried to bring some distinguished stranger into the toils . It was in an effort of this kind that we caught our first // and last glimpse of the handwriting of Percival , whose luxuriant but moody genius stirred our young minds in those days with something of a Byronic power . But imperfectly stocked as he was in worldly wisdom , he was too wise to be caught in our snare , and while he accepted the proffered membership , he respectfully declined the invitation to become our poet . But this year the " Brothers " had an orator , - not yet a great man , indeed , but , if college traditions could be trusted , destined to become so ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the committee that chose him , we felt that we had ourselves borne part in the selection . He was , in a fractional sense at least , our orator ; and we rose on that eventful morning with a firm resolve to stand by the man of our choice . With what care we dressed for the solemn occasion ! How often was the spotless silk ribbon put on and off , until the talismanic medal which it supported had been brought to its true position ! You may be sure that we were the first at the library door , wondering not a little that on such a day anybody should be willing to be second . At length the room began to fill . New and strange faces crowded the familiar seats , - the graduates of other years , looking round them with mixed feelings upon a spot which they had once held as their own . Then came the call to order , and the forming of the procession , and the cheering notes of the band , and the solemn march , arm in arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and along the wide street , and up the broad church-aisle , bright eyes looking on us the while , and not unlooked at in return ; while , in the dizzy confusion , a glimpse of a broad forehead and of a waving gown was all that we saw of our orator , till he rose in the pulpit , and in calm , clear , impressive tones announced the subject of his discourse : " The different effects resulting to nations and to individuals from different forms of intellectual exertion , is a theme dignified in speculation and momentous in practice. ** We never heard that voice again . But it was often heard where earnest men met to take counsel together about the great questions of the age , uttering words that , for an entire generation , sank into hundreds of responsive hearts , as on the afternoon of that unforgotten day they sank into ours . And // when , two years ago , we read that Horace Mann had lain down to his long sleep , on the threshold of a new labor of usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his early triumphs , and asking that a grave might be made for him under the shadow of our alma mater , the remembrance of our first and only meeting came back to us in all its freshness , and we felt that we too had lost a benefactor and a friend . But it is time that we entered upon the more immediate subject of our paper . The author of the volume before us first made himself generally known by a translation of Cousin 's Examination of Locke , one of the most important parts of that eloquent course which completed the revolution in French philosophy begun by Royer-Collard in 1811 . It is seldom that prose translation from a modern language gives literary position ; but this was so well done , so faithful to the spirit and letter of the original , - a work as remarkable for vigor and elegance of style as for depth and accuracy of thought , - and the notes and comments were so judicious , and gave such evidence of a mind imbued with the principles of a pure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate reputation , but was received as the harbinger of a brilliant and fruitful career . Thus known , he was called to pay the usual American tax for literary distinction , in anniversary addresses and occasional contributions to periodical literature , appearing only three times , we believe , as a professed author for the next twenty years ; - first in a small collection of " Moral and Philosophical Essays ; * then in a translation of a French " Epitome of the History of Philosophy , " f to which he added a valuable appendix , bringing the work down from Reid to Cousin and his disciples ; and next in " Dr. Oldham at Greystones , and his Talk there , " published indeed anonymously , but speedily recognized by the public and acknowledged by its author . " Dr. Oldham " is one of the few books that are written not so much to make a book as because the writer has something * Moral and Philosophical Essays . By C. S. HENRY , D.

Harper 's Family Library . 1841. // to say. * The form is partly dialogue , and partly that kind of dissertation into which the head of a family is so apt to fall when he loves to talk , and they are not unwilling to listen . In general character it belongs to the classic dialogue . This , - one of the most beautiful forms of literature , - in the hands of Plato and Tully , became the vehicle of the choicest wisdom of antiquity . If in modern times it has fallen into comparative neglect , it is chiefly , we believe , through our inconsiderate haste , although our pretentious vanity generally attributes it to a superior earnestness , neglectful of forms , and pushing straight on to the pith and marrow of thought . As if form were not as much a part of thought as light of color ; and as if external beauty - we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of this too - were something more than a sympathetic harmony with the beauty within . It is only when imitation takes the place of spontaneous impulse , and men write merely for the sake of book-making , that form ceases to be the characteristic exponent of thought . It was not Homer 's fault that the Cyclic poets wrote tame verses in the exactest metre , but the blame lay in the presumption of men who aspired to the poet 's laurel without the impulse of the poet 's inspiration . " Tu se ' 10 mio maestro e 1 mio autore , " - " Thou art my master , and my teacher thou , " says Dante to Virgil , and , widely as the two poets differ in everything else , it is impossible to see how Dante uses the noble language that was springing into vigorous life under his forming hand , without feeling that he was truly Virgil 's scholar . The complaint , in spirit , at least , is as old as Quintilian , who raised his warning voice eighteen centuries ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atque inertia factum est ut artes esse plures videantur. " t In all the best ages of literature , the profoundest thinkers have , with very few exceptions , been the best writers , - accurate in the use of language , observant of the laws of proportion , and * " J ca n't see that a man has any business to write at all , unless he has something which he thoroughly believes and wants to preach about . " - Sekool Days at Rugby , Preface , p. 5. t Quint . de Inst . Orat. , Proem. // enjoying with a keen relish the graces of appropriate diction and the harmony of musical periods . Ideas and words , substance and form , practice and theory , form sharp antitheses , indeed , but antitheses hovering , as they all do , on the brink of falsehood , and as fatal to exactness and precision of thought as to grace and perspicuity of style . Thought and Style , says an allegory which we have either dreamed of or read , were twins by birth , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother , they set out upon the journey of life together . Hand in hand they went on , now gazing with wondering eyes at the objects which stood by the wayside , and now turning , with a smile of unutterable affection , to look at each other . Whenever Thought felt himself moved more deeply by anything that he saw , he pressed the hand of Style , and leaned harder upon him ; and whenever Style stooped to gather a gay flower or a sweetscented shrub , he laid it confidingly upon the bosom of Thought . At last they came in sight of a high mountain , so high that the top of it was hidden by the clouds ; but just below the clouds was a temple of white marble , which shone in the sunbeams so brightly that the light from it extended down to the foot of the mountain , and illuminated the whole course of the steep and rugged path that led up to it . As they drew nearer , they heard a murmur of running water , which grew clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glow with a delight they had never experienced before . Soon they came to the spot whence the sound proceeded , - a sparkling fountain with a margin of green grass around it , smiling all over with flowers . On the grass there sat an old man , with a long white beard , and long white locks that curled around his forehead and over his neck as thickly as if he had been a boy . Every now and then he would stoop down to the fountain , and drink a full draught , and every time that he bent himself over the waters , they seemed to swell upward and meet his lips half-way . When he had finished drinking , he would turn his face to the light that fell from the temple , as if he loved to bathe himself in its beams . The two brothers felt their hearts strangely moved as they gazed upon this old man , there was such a grand air of power 45* // about him , and his face seemed to glow with such a lamber*t play of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , they saw that he was blind , and they went up to him reverently , and took his hands in theirs , each a hand in his own , and laid them upon their heads . " I know you , " said the old man as he felt the touch of their hands ; " I heard your footsteps afar off over the green meadows , and have been cooling myself on this soft turf , and strengthening myself with these sweet waters for the journey we are to go together . " And he rose , and all three addressed themselves to the way . It was a narrow and rugged path , and ever as they went the old man leaned lovingly on the shoulders of the youths , and the youths seemed proud and happy to feel his great arms around them . One who had looked before and behind them would have wondered to see how the flowers sprang up wherever they passed , till the path which looked so rough before seemed to have been suddenly transformed into a garden-walk . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own accord , to the sound of sweetest music , and a voice came from its inmost recesses , saying : Welcome my son , welcome to the throne that I have prepared for thee , and from which thou shalt judge my worshippers through all time , and in every land ; and welcome , too , shall be all they who come as you have done , leaning lovingly and trustingly on my chosen ministers , the twin offspring of Nature and Truth . " We regard it , therefore , as a great merit in " Dr. Gidham , " that the author has taken pains to clothe his thoughts in appropriate language , to use sterling English , to arrange his words in an order pleasing to the ear and satisfactory to the intellect , and to pitch his sentences in a key well suited to the nature and the range of his subject . If we were to attempt to characterize this work in a few words , we should call it the result of much reading , much observation , and much thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an imagination easily warmed to that kind of poetry and eloquence which is so often combined with a taste for philosophical inquiry . It may remind you of Southey 's " Doctor , " but the suggestion is by no means necessary ; and we have very little respect for that style of criticism which is constantly crying // out , " Stop thief ! " at every recurrence of a familiar idea . It is impossible to read Sterne , and not remember that there once lived a Rabelais ; or the " Doctor " himself , without feeling that , in the vast range of his insatiable reading , Southey must have found time to return more than once to the , voluntary eccentricities of " Tristram Shandy . " The manner in which one mind acts upon another is a curious and instructive inquiry , full of suggestion for the philosophical teacher , as well as for the philosophical critic . It is pleasant to follow the footprints of Homer through the sonorous hexameters of Virgil ; to see how Tasso learned from both ; and how all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty structure of the " Paradise Lost . " But it is a sad trifling with great things , if we might not better call it a profanation , to term Tasso a copyist because the night-scene in the second book of the " Jerusalem " is a translation of the night-scene in the fourth book of the KEneid " ; or to accuse Milton of plagiarism because the sixteenth line of the " Paradise Lost " is done , word for word , into English from the second stanza of the " Orlando Furioso . " We may justly envy the feelings of the traveller who makes his way through solitude and danger to the source of a mighty river . But who would envy either the spirit or the judgment of the man who , with chain and compass in hand , should make it his pride to follow up every brooklet that might babble across his path ? The author of a pleasant book is our friend and benefactor ; and we are by no means disposed , while enjoying the fruit of his labors , to lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of thought that may now and then recall to our minds some earlier benefactor who had already performed for us the same friendly office . Originality , however , is not the characteristic of this volume . The author 's mind belongs rather , as it seems to us , to that class which works skilfully upon truths already discovered , than to that which enlarges the world of thought by new discoveries . It has been both said and sung , that one of the chief merits of a good writer consists in giving appropriate expression to ideas which already existed in many minds , although they had never found so fitting an utterance before . Without subscribing to this doctrine in its full extent , we // may safely allow that few writers are more useful or more generally acceptable than those who , without adding materially to the substance of our knowledge , add materially to its efficiency by bringing it into clearer light , and giving it a more tangible form . From this point of view , " Dr. Oldham " is a work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important truths . Without incident , it attains a certain air of life and movement by a happy intermixture of dialogue and description . And without claiming to be a story , it is brought to the very verge of the story-teller 's appropriate province by the assignment of a definite locality and a felicitous delineation of character . The Doctor himself is a character ; - a man of quick impulses and tenacious opinions ; speculative , yet dogmatic ; with a quick eye for the ridiculous in others , yet quite unconscious of it in himself ; with a keen relish of the beautiful where his habits of thought permit him to see it , a warm love of truth , and a thorough contempt for hypocrisy ; - but somewhat inclined to think that , where he does not see it , there is no beauty to be seen ; that the truth as he holds it is all of it that is worth bolding ; and that hypocrisy is never so thoroughly detestable as when she assumes the garb of some class for which he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a man by words rather than by actions ; for we very much doubt whether either Scott or Cooper could have made us look upon him with half the respect in active life , that unconsciously arises in our bosoms as we listen to his eloquent disquisitions in the embowering shades of Greystones . Mrs. Oldham is equally well conceived and equally well drawn , with a woman 's happy adaptation to uncontrollable circumstances , and a wife 's skill in softening her husband 's defects . The other characters are profiles rather than portraits , - sketches to be filled up by the imagination of the reader , and serving chiefly to bring out the Doctor 's ideas upon the various topics which the whim of the moment and a somewhat erratic imagination suggest . Indeed , the motto on the title-page - De omnibus rebus et quibusdam aijis , " About everything and something more - may be taken as a key to the volume , which , faithful to its // promise , begins with a library table , and ends with the phenomena of suggestion ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boldly with the science of government ; talks of the stars and of little children , of woman s rights and the true idea of God , of bad catechisms and the real gentleman ; eulogizes nonsense , and warms into genuine poetry at the sight of a beautiful landscape on a June morning ; - serious or humorous , as the fancy dictates ; always lively , generally judicious , sometimes profound ; genial in the main , but with now and then an outfiashing of what circumstances might convert into bitterness and satire . We have already hinted that it is freshness of form , rather than originality of thought , that is to be looked for in this volume ; and we like it none the less for telling us in a new way what we have often heard before . The doctrines themselves are , for the most part , just , - such , indeed , as we should expect from a disciple of Cousin , after ten years ' experience in an American college , and fifty years ' observation of American life . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departments of knowledge , that the mind of the man is brought into immediate contact with the mind of the boy . Questions that for him have long been decided come up to be discussed and settled anew . Ideas that have taken their place firmly among the foundations of his moral and intellectual character , each with the peculiar coloring which his peculiar habits of mind would give it , are brought into new points of view as new lights are thrown upon them by the peculiar coloring of other minds . He is like a general in an enemy 's country , constantly on his guard , throwing out skirmishers in front and on his flanks , and carefully watching every movement in his rear . Or , still more , perhaps , he is like the commander of a beleaguered fortress , going hourly rounds through all its defences , and holding himself ready to repulse the enemy at every point . The solitary student has seldom that ready command of his knowledge which enables the man of the world to appear to twice his advantage with half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself , that he could always argue best when he argued alone ; or , in other words , that he could // make a better use of his thoughts when he sat down tranquilly , pen in hand , to arrange them according to the laws of his own mind , than when he was compelled , as in conversation , to muster them at a moment 's warning , and marshal them according to the laws of another 's mind . But the student who passes daily from his study to the class-room , and is called upon to answer objections and explain difficulties upon the subjects of his daily thoughts , as he leads fresh travellers over familiar tracts , where every mile-stone recalls similar experiences and discussions , learns to keep his knowledge as a good librarian keeps his books , with a fixed place for every volume , and every volume in its place . His ideas thus acquire all the completeness of elaborate preparation , with a readiness of application which solitary thought seldom gives . It is evident that " Dr. Oldham " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the clearness , distinctness , and precision of a teacher 's mind , with somewhat , perhaps , of that tone of dogmatical injunction which it is so hard for a teacher to lay completely aside . The hero talks like one who is accustomed to be listened to , and meets objections with the air of a man who would sooner ride over a thing than allow it to obstruct his progress . Some of his precepts would make children very happy , and many an unnatural wrinkle might be smoothed out of older brows by a frank and hearty acceptance of his doctrine of nonsense , - an admirable amplification of the iloratian desipere in loco . The most elaborate chapters in the book are the chapters on government , which deserve a careful perusal , both for their general correctness , and as felicitous specimens of the author 's skill in condensed exposition . Hardly less important in substance , though of more questionable form , are the fragments of theology which are scattered here and there , with a free , rather than a reverential hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to forget its importance as the appropriate clothing of a devout and humble mind . Few men are so absolutely under the government of ideas as to be altogether independent of the language in which they are expressed . Nowhere , indeed , does the power of association display itself more enduringly , than in the connection // which it establishes between words and things . Even the Hebrew , with its meagre vocabulary of less than eight thousand words , has a large class which are found only in poetry . So instinctively do we feel that thoughts which elevate the mind should be expressed with a corresponding elevation of language . Hence , by that exaggeration which is so natural to the human mind , grew up that poetical diction which , at some period or other in the history of every literature , has usurped the place of poetry itself , - the hypocrisy of Parnassus , more venial , it is true , than the hypocrisy of religion and virtue , but not less surely fatal to the cause whose semblance it assumes . But even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid , and still pays , the penalty of venturing too far , and pruning with too bold a hand ; and we can not but fear that the man who , even with the most reverential spirit , speaks of sacred things in the same tone and language with which he speaks of the common questions of daily life , will find many to imitate his language , and few to profit by his devotion . We regret this tone the more in a work of so high an order , inasmuch as we regard the want of reverence as one of the chief moral defects of our national character . The American boy is said to be the least respectful of sons , the American daughter the least respectful of daughters . This defect of the youth becomes a vice in the man or woman , and , extending , as all radical errors do , to the various relations of life , gradually undermines the foundations of society itself . If the philosopher who walks with his eyes fixed on the stars sometimes stumbles into a ditch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sure , in a long journey , to lose his way . It was not the least of Washington* s services to his country , that he gave her a model of greatness which grows the more upon the imagination , the more closely it is studied . Yet there are few of us who have not , in the course of our American experience , been called upon to defend even the character of Washington . It is from this point of view that we have always looked upon the twelve volumes of Mr. Sparks and the five volumes of Mr. Irving as the most important moral and educational contributions that have ever been made to American literature , justifying as they do , on every page , the highest praises that // have been bestowed on this most perfect character of all history . In this connection , too , we would publicly record our gratitude to Mr. Whipple for that masterly essay , in which , with unanswerable force of argument and admirable vigor of style , he has shown how thoroughly , in this wonderful man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highest qualities of our moral nature . It is by filling the youthful mind with the associations which , in the course of studies like these , unconsciously form themselves into ideals , that the boy learns to feel with what a vast debt of gratitude he is entering upon the duties of life , and how rigid an account he will be called upon to give of the manner in which he repays it . To the volume the title of which we have placed at the head of this article we had proposed to devote a much larger space than we have given to its anonymous companion . They may easily be recognized as productions of the same pen , children of the same father , and possessing in an equal degree the characteristics of their father 's mind , - clearness , vigor , and a partiality for general principles and metaphysical forms , with many of the excellences and some of the defects to which the combiiied habits of the pulpit and the class-room , unless carefully watched over and skilfully controlled , are so apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , for the morning paper brings us - in the midst of exultation and triumph - the unexpected tidings of a great , a bitter , a general loss . Felton - a name associated with our earliest connection with these pages , a name which recalls all that was liberal in scholarship , comprehensive in culture , pure in sentiment , and generous in appreciation , - the warm-hearted friend , the genial companion , ever busy with book or pen , ever ready for earnest discussion or merry pastime , whose memory we shall never recall without its awakening a thousand tender recollections - has suddenly closed , in mid-career , a life so full of laborious usefulness in the past , and which , but an hour ago , still seemed to us so full of promise for the future . Let others tell all that he did for the cause of sound learning and pure taste , - how well he taught both by precept and example , how high he aimed and how high he reached ; for us the grief is still too fresh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a painful effort that we record his name , and , as we write it , bathe it with our tears .
