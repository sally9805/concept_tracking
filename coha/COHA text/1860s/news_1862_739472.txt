txt Before leaving this Valley of the Shenandoah , or , as it has proved to many , the valley of the shadow of death , I wish to go leisurely over the ground , as a gleaner might , gathering up the loose straws and binding them up for you into a full sheaf . The pursuit of JAMISON is virtually ended , at least so far Its our column is concerned . After baying him to nearly the end of the Valley , and making a vigorous snap at his retreating heels as he trotted over the bridge at Port Republic , we have now fallen back , lest he should in turn become pursuer . We lett Port Republic early on Monday morning , camping at Harrisonburgh . Our resting place the next evening was in the vicinity of New-Market , about eighteen miles from llarrisonburgh , and on Thursday I left FREmozer 's command at Mount Jackson , where it will probably remain for some time , if permitted by the proprietor of the mountain . Mount Jackson is midway between Front Royal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be told in a very few words . Jame:nes force , which all the time greatly exceeded ours , has been swelled by LONGSTREET% command . SIIIELD8 , upon whom we relied for support at this juncture has been ordered to Richmond , and at last accounts was marching thither . The morning that this news came we had a pontoon bridge well nigh over the river , intending to cross that evening ; but after its reception , we concluded we would n't . Only one thing remained to be done , to fall back and await reinforcements . and supplies . The men of the command were worn down by long marches and short rations . Much of the time they were obliged to rely for food upon the scanty supplies that could be foraged from neighboring farm-houses . They were almost wholly destitute of shoes , and poorly provided with clothing . Their spirits all this while had been Sustained by the prospect of soon overtaking the enemy , and finding in the recaptured baggage-train all the euppiles needed . As this prospect grew dim , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from an overwhelming force , their spirits saiik , discontent became manifest , and I much question whether it would have been possible to march them Much further without producing open mutiny . Fee/410NT has adopted the only alternative that offered , falling back upon a central point to rest and recuperate his ecimmind . If blame attacLes to any one for the movement , it certainly can not cling to his skirts . The depredations committed by the German Division have given a new word to the language . When as articie is missed under suspicious circumstances , it is said to be " Blenkered . " But my own observation leads rue to believe that the Germans have been made the scapegoats of the whole army . 1 have seen Yankees pillage a dairy of its cream , depopulate a hen-roost , and then trumpet forma accusations through their noses against " Beeetares men . " That the latter are insubordinate , and given to riotous living and plundering , is a sad fact that can not be disputed . I have seen a company of them strip a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of female occupants . Under these circumstances , the thought has occurred to me that were any patriotic Southern soldier to desecrate our mothers ' thresholds in the same manner , he would be shot down in the attempt , though a regiment stood at his back . But the hands of others than the Teutons are stained with pillage , though it must be confessed that the latter have engaged in it with a zeal that in a better cause would meta admiration . The circumstances of our march have favored this sort of thing . If an officer remonstrated , the question w as asked , " Why , then , do you not feed us ? We must live . " But now the necessity is ended , and Gen. FREMONT avows his intention to compel the observance of private rights , and stop " Blenkering , " though he has to keep onehalf his army standing guard over the other . And I think he 'll succeed in his virtuous intentions . A more beautiful country than this Valley of the Shenandoah , God 's sun never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sterile peaks and frownleg rocks . Green vestured fields and gentle roundbosomed hills nestle down in the arms of great mountains , and you know they are quick with growing life even while they slumber . It rather moves me to sympathy to see the trail of devastation that the two armies have left after them . Meadows of clover are trodden into mud ; the tossing plumes of the wheat fields along the line of march are shorn down , as though a thousand reaping machines had passed over and through them . Dead horses lie along the road , entirely overpowering the sweet scent of the clover blossoms , and flinging out upon the air a more villainous stench than could by any possibility ascend from the left wing of the Tartarean pit . In justice , I think our Government should equip a corps of men with cologne bottles , to follow along the line of road , and sprinkle the unsavory quadrepedal corpses . Fences are not , landmarks have vanished , and all is one common waste . But struggling with the tide of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that it is well that those who poured out this bitter crimson chalice should have it pressed home to their own lips . Had Virginia known what civil war meant , she never would have plunged into it . Had the South known how diffliailt a word secession was to spell out in actual accomplishment , it tnever would have attempted to pronounce the first syllable . They all thought that war merely meant loud speeches and blazoned barmers , gay uniforms ana rattling sabres . That it meant death and destruction , that the mother would know that the light was fading from her boy 's blue eves on a bloody field , and she not near to whisper work- , 97 love ; that the biether , in the rush of battle strike fiercely at a foe and find that he had etas q brother 's heart , all this never until now was pliii ; e1i- ; the Southern mind They viewed war In Its iontantis Dhagy and 1101 it rea , 11nve g fear that itv . State which has not now seceded will ever in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate has overtaken Virginia , Maryland will remain quietly loyal . Ohio will be satisfied with the bounds of the Union . New-York will have no desire to go further and fare worse . The lesson is a bitter but a salutary one , and if the Union Is ever restored there Will never again be reason to repent it . I am very much interested in our cavalry . It must be admitted that with us it is not quite so efficient an arm of the service as it might be made . Why Wish ; so , I can not determine . We have excellent horses and good riders ; there is no reason why we should not have splendid cavalry regiments , and a well disciplined one is a terrible bolt to launch on the flanks of an enemy . However much may be said about the capability of infantry to resist a cavalry charge , It la very certain that a mounted man , coming down at full speed on a footman , carries with him a moral force that the latter can very seldom withstand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter as the mounted man approaches , until when you reach him he has no legs at all . But to make cavalry men effective , in my opinion , you should give them no weapon but the sabre . Train them well to its use , and make them rely upon it solely . Arm them with carabine and pistol . and they &Imply; lnok on the sabre as designed for rattle and show , and fail to do good servilee with the othor weapons . I have seen mounted men deliver fire so frequently , and with Birch innocent results , that I would be perfectly willing to let them fire at me by platoons for any adequate consideration . But let them ride to the charge in a solid column , raised in their stirrups and their cold steel glittering in the sunbeams , and infantry generally incline to get out of the way . Why the cavalry of our army have won such an eminent reputation as marauders , unless the bad habit is begotten by the necessity of occasionally supplying themselves with a " mount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be that they gradually come to have no scruples as to sheep . In this regard the crossed carving knives they wear on their caps have a peculiar significance , and are very suggestive of mutton . Cavalry , when routed , are a sad inconvenience to their own friends , who happen to lie in the way of their retreat . I witnessed a remarkable instance of this at riarrisonburgh , when I with ease escaped the menacing front of the enemy , but had great difficulty in avoiding being ridden down by our retreating squadrons . It is since ascertained , that the force drawn up to receive us on that occasion far exceeded our first conjectures . It consisted of JACKSON 'S whole rear guard , allot ASHBY 'S Cavalry , and three regiments of infantry . It was a wise plan , under such circumstances , to retreat with all possible celerity , but nothing can be said in excuse of the rout that ensued . Had Asnar followed us closely , not a man would have reached town . Apropos of the Harrisonburgh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that memorable day , our hundred and twenty-eight " Bucktails " encountered three Southern regiments --  , a Virginian regiment , the Louisiana Tigers , and the First Maryland . It was while leading the latter that ASIM was killed . In addition , they admit a loss , in killed and wounded , of nearly a hundred . My informant told me that they thought there was a whole brigade of " Bucktails " opposed to them , and were never so surprised as when they saw the mere handful of men that broke cover and retreated across the wheat field . Con KA  --  N could have been removed from the field when first wounded , and a couple of men actually had him on their shoulders for that purpose , but he refused to go , and manifested no intention of giving the order to retreat . It is of such stuff that heroes are made ; and here let me remark , that this " Bucktail " episode is the only instance of real bravery that I have seen since following the army . To stand one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier 's duty ; but to stand tine fight , when the odds are twenty to one , and you have several brigades to fall back upon it il ? , posed to . is something beyond . With twenty thousand such men I believe the war could be elide , ' in three inoi:ths . To my " Duckbills " and their brave Colonel belongs the credit of having cleared our path of ASHBY , who alone , was worth five thousand ' ism And it joys me to learn that the Colonel is , live , though a prh-oner , and not dead , as was at first supposed . His brother , ELIzillA KENT KANE. went to explore the North Pole : the Colonel has only gone to sec % ; hat lice at the South . 1 nave jab ! learned that CArtur. , Nvitli a brigade from Suttee &; command , held the bridge at Port Republic long enough to have burned it , but die not , altiaugh such w ere his orders .

JACKSON would have found himself in a truly Irate which he could only hare extricated himl. self by cutting his way through Fitemo  --  r 's command . lie might have accomplished this eventually , but not in a day . As I write they are bringing past me the wounded who are to go in by the same train that carries this letter . When it is hard for a man to get through this world with the usual rather illiberal allowance of legs , what under Heaven are these poor fellows to do who have only one ?
