" Look on this picture , and on this . "  --  Hamlet . AUTHOR 'S PREFACE . This play was written for my own amusement , and not with the remotest thought that it would ever be seen by the public eye . I read it privately , however , to a circle of my friends , and through them was invited to read it before a Literary Society . Since then , the Drama has been given in various parts of the country . By the earnest solicitation of some in whose judgment I have the greatest confidence , I now present it in a printed form to the public . As I never aspired to be a dramatist , I ask no favor for it , and have little or no solicitude for its fate . If it is not readable , no word of mine can make it so ; if it is , to ask favor for it would be needless . The main features in the Drama are true . Glen and Melinda are actual characters , and still reside in Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of eighteen years at the South . The marriage ceremony , as performed in the second act , is still adhered to in many of the Southern States , especially in the farming districts . The ignorance of the slave , as seen in the case of " Big Sally , " is common wherever chattel slavery exists . The difficulties created in the domestic circle by the presence of beautiful slave women , as found in Dr. Gaines 's family , is well understood by all who have ever visited the valley of the Mississippi . The play , no doubt , abounds in defects , but as I was born in slavery , and never had a day 's schooling in my life , I owe the public no apology for errors . W. W. B. Characters Represented . Dr. Gaines , proprietor of the farm at Muddy Creek . Rev. John Pinchen , a clergyman . Dick Walker , a slave speculator . Mr. Wildmarsh , neighbor to Dr. Gaines .

Scene 1 .  --  A Sitting-Room . Mrs. Gaines , looking at some drawings  --  Sampey , a white slave , stands behind the lady 's chair . Enter Dr. Gaines , r . Dr. Gaines . Dr. Gaines Well , my dear , my practice is steadily increasing . I forgot to tell you that neighbor Wyman engaged me yesterday as his family physician ; and I hope that the fever and ague , which is now taking hold of the people , will give me more patients . I see by the New Orleans papers that the yellow fever is raging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are reaping a harvest in that section this year . I would that we could have a touch of the yellow fever here , for I think I could invent a medicine that would cure it . But the yellow fever is a luxury that we medical men in this climate ca n't expect to enjoy ; yet we may hope for the cholera . Mrs. Gaines . Mrs. Gaines Yes , I would be glad to see it more sickly here , so that your business might prosper . But we are always unfortunate . Every body here seems to be in good health , and I am afraid that they 'll keep so . However , we must hope for the best . We must trust in the Lord . Providence may possibly send some disease amongst us for our benefit . Enter Cato , r . Cato . Cato Mr. Campbell is at de door , massa . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Ask him in , Cato . Enter Mr. Campbell , r . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Good morning , Mr. Campbell . Be seated . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same to you , Mrs. Gaines . Fine morning , this . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Yes , sir ; beautiful day . Mr. C. Mr. Campbell Well , doctor , I 've come to engage you for my family physician . I am tired of Dr. Jones . I 've lost another very valuable nigger under his treatment ; and , as my old mother used to say , " change of pastures makes fat calves . " Dr. G. Dr. Gaines I shall be most happy to become your doctor . Of course , you want me to attend to your niggers , as well as to your family ? Mr. C. Mr. Campbell Certainly , sir . I have twenty-three servants . What will you charge me by the year ? Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Of course , you 'll do as my other patients do , send your servants to me when they are sick , if able to walk ? Mr. C. Mr. Campbell Oh , yes ; I always do that . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Then I suppose I 'll have to lump it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell Well , then , we 'll consider that matter settled ; and as two of the boys are sick , I 'll send them over . So I 'll bid you good day , doctor . I would be glad if you would come over some time , and bring Mrs. Gaines with you . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Yes , I will ; and shall be glad if you will pay us a visit , and bring with you Mrs. Campbell . Come over and spend the day . Mr. C. Mr. Campbell I will . Good morning , doctor . Exit Mr. Campbell , r . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines There , my dear , what do you think of that ? Five hundred dollars more added to our income . That 's patronage worth having ! And I am glad to get all the negroes I can to doctor , for Cato is becoming very useful to me in the shop . He can bleed , pull teeth , and do almost any thing that the blacks require . He can put up medicine as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ G. Mrs. Gaines But why did you ask Mr. Campbell to visit you , and to bring his wife ? I am sure I could never consent to associate with her , for I understand that she was the daughter of a tanner . You must remember , my dear , that I was born with a silver spoon in my mouth . The blood of the Wyleys runs in my veins . I am surprised that you should ask him to visit you at all ; you should have known better . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Oh , I did not mean for him to visit me . I only invited him for the sake of compliments , and I think he so understood it ; for I should be far from wishing you to associate with Mrs. Campbell . I do n't forget , my dear , the family you were raised in , nor do I overlook my own family . My father , you know , fought by the side of Washington , and I hope some day to have a handle to my own name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a medical man . Ah ! by-the-by , I had forgotten that I have a couple of patients to visit this morning . I must go at once . Exit Dr. Gaines , r . Enter Hannah , l . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Go , Hannah , and tell Dolly to kill a couple of fat pullets , and to put the biscuit to rise . I expect brother Pinchen here this afternoon , and I want every thing in order . Hannah , Hannah , tell Melinda to come here . Exit Hannah , l . We mistresses do have a hard time in this world ; I do n't see why the Lord should have imposed such heavy duties on us poor mortals . Well , it ca n't last always . I long to leave this wicked world , and go home to glory . Enter Melinda . I am to have company this afternoon , Melinda . I expect brother Pinchen here , and I want every thing in order . Go and get one of my new caps , with the lace border , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go out , tell Hannah to clean the white-handled knives , and see that not a speck is on them ; for I want every thing as it should be while brother Pinchen is here .

Glen How slowly the time passes away . I 've been waiting here two hours , and Melinda has not yet come . What keeps her , I can not tell . I waited long and late for her last night , and when she approached , I sprang to my feet , caught her in my arms , pressed her to my heart , and kissed away the tears from her moistened cheeks . She placed her trembling hand in mine , and said , " Glen , I am yours ; I will never be the wife of another . " I clasped her to my bosom , and called God to witness that I would ever regard her as my wife . Old Uncle Joseph joined us in holy wedlock by moonlight ; that was the only marriage ceremony . I look upon the vow as ever binding on me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our union in heaven . Still , this man , who claims Melinda as his property , is unwilling for me to marry the woman of my choice , because he wants her himself . But he shall not have her . What he will say when he finds that we are married , I can not tell ; but I am determined to protect my wife or die . Ah ! here comes Melinda . Enter Melinda , r . I am glad to see you , Melinda . I 've been waiting long , and feared you would not come . Ah ! in tears again ? Melinda . Melinda Glen , you are always thinking I am in tears . But what did master say to-day ? Glen . Glen He again forbade our union . Melinda . Melinda Indeed ! Can he be so cruel ? Glen . Glen Yes , he can be just so cruel . Melinda . Melinda Alas ! alas ! how unfeeling and heartless ! But did you appeal to his generosity ? Glen . Glen Yes , I did ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but to no purpose ; he was inflexible . He even offered me a new suit of clothes , if I would give you up ; and when I told him that I could not , he said he would flog me to death if I ever spoke to you again . Melinda . Melinda And what did you say to him ? Glen . Glen I answered , that , while I loved life better than death , even life itself could not tempt me to consent to a separation that would make life an unchanging curse . Oh , I would kill myself , Melinda , if I thought that , for the sake of life , I could consent to your degradation . No , Melinda , I can die , but shall never live to see you the mistress of another man . But , my dear girl , I have a secret to tell you , and no one must know it but you . I will go out and see that no person is within hearing . I will be back soon . Exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that the darkest hour of the night precedes the dawn . It is ever thus with the vicissitudes of human suffering . After the soul has reached the lowest depths of despair , and can no deeper plunge amid its rolling , foetid shades , then the reactionary forces of man 's nature begin to operate , resolution takes the place of despondency , energy succeeds instead of apathy , and an upward tendency is felt and exhibited . Men then hope against power , and smile in defiance of despair . I shall never forget when first I saw Glen . It is now more than a year since he came here with his master , Mr. Hamilton . It was a glorious moonlight night in autumn . The wide and fruitful face of nature was silent and buried in repose . The tall trees on the borders of Muddy Creek waved their leafy branches in the breeze , which was wafted from afar , refreshing over hill and vale , over the rippling water , and the waving corn and wheat fields . The starry sky was studded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon , as if rejoicing to witness the meeting of two hearts that should be cemented by the purest love , sailed triumphantly along among the shifting vapors . Oh , how happy I have been in my acquaintance with Glen ! That he loves me , I do well believe it ; that I love him , it is most true . Oh , how I would that those who think the slave incapable of the finer feelings , could only see our hearts , and learn our thoughts ,  --  thoughts that we dare not utter in the presence of our masters ! But I fear that Glen will be separated from me , for there is nothing too base and mean for master to do , for the purpose of getting me entirely in his power . But , thanks to Heaven , he does not own Glen , and therefore can not sell him . Yet he might purchase him from his brother-in-law , so as to send him out of the way . But here comes my husband . Enter Glen , l . Glen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , and all is quiet . Now , Melinda , as you are my wife , I will confide to you a secret . I 've long been thinking of making my escape to Canada , and taking you with me . It is true that I do n't belong to your master , but he might buy me from Hamilton , and then sell me out of the neighborhood . Melinda . Melinda But we could never succeed in the attempt to escape . Glen . Glen We will make the trial , and show that we at least deserve success . There is a slave trader expected here next week , and Dr. Gaines would sell you at once if he knew that we were married . We must get ready and start , and if we can pass the Ohio river , we 'll be safe on the road to Canada . Exit , r . Scene 4.  --  Dinning-Room . Rev. Mr. Pinchen giving Mrs. Gaines an account of his experience as a minister  --  Hannah clearing away the breakfast table  --  Sampey standing behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , do give me more of your experience , brother Pinchen . It always does my soul good to hear religious experience . It draws me nearer and nearer to the Lord 's side . I do love to hear good news from God 's people . Mr. Pinchen . Mr. Pinchen Well , sister Gaines , I 've had great opportunities in my time to study the heart of man . I 've attended a great many camp-meetings , revival meetings , protracted meetings , and death-bed scenes , and I am satisfied , sister Gaines , that the heart of man is full of sin , and desperately wicked . This is a wicked world , sister Gaines , a wicked world . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Were you ever in Arkansas , brother Pinchen ? I 've been told that the people out there are very ungodly . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Oh , yes , sister Gaines . I once spent a year at Little Rock , and preached in all the towns round about there ; and I found some hard cases out there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week in a district where there were a great many horse thieves , and one night , somebody stole my pony . Well , I knowed it was no use to make a fuss , so I told brother Tarbox to say nothing about it , and I 'd get my horse by preaching God 's everlasting gospel ; for I had faith in the truth , and knowed that my Savior would not let me lose my pony . So the next Sunday I preached on horse-stealing , and told the brethren to come up in the evenin ' with their hearts filled with the grace of God . So that night the house was crammed brim full with anxious souls , panting for the bread of life . Brother Bingham opened with prayer , and brother Tarbox followed , and I saw right off that we were gwine to have a blessed time . After I got ' em pretty well warmed up , I jumped on to one of the seats , stretched out my hands , and said , " I know who stole my pony ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tryin ' to make people believe that you 've got religion ; but you ai n't got it . And if you do n't take my horse back to brother Tarbox 's pasture this very night , I 'll tell your name right out in meetin ' to-morrow night . Take my pony back , you vile and wretched sinner , and come up here and give your heart to God . " So the next mornin ' , I went out to brother Tarbox 's pasture , and sure enough , there was my bob-tail pony . Yes , sister Gaines , there he was , safe and sound . Ha , ha , ha . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Oh , how interesting , and how fortunate for you to get your pony ! And what power there is in the gospel ! God 's children are very lucky . Oh , it is so sweet to sit here and listen to such good news from God 's people ! You Hannah , what are you standing there listening for , and neglecting your work ? Never mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am done here . Go at your work this moment , you lazy huzzy ! Never mind , I 'll whip you well . Aside . Come , do go on , brother Pinchen , with your godly conversation . It is so sweet ! It draws me nearer and nearer to the Lord 's side . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Well , sister Gaines , I 've had some mighty queer dreams in my time , that I have . You see , one night I dreamed that I was dead and in heaven , and such a place I never saw before . As soon as I entered the gates of the celestial empire , I saw many old and familiar faces that I had seen before . The first person that I saw was good old Elder Pike , the preacher that first called my attention to religion . The next person I saw was Deacon Billings , my first wife 's father , and then I saw a host of godly faces . Why , sister Gaines , you knowed Elder Goosbee , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see him there ? He married me to my first husband . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Oh , yes , sister Gaines , I saw the old Elder , and he looked for all the world as if he had just come out of a revival meetin ' . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Did you see my first husband there , brother Pinchen ? Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh No , sister Gaines , I did n't see brother Pepper there ; but I 've no doubt but that brother Pepper was there . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Well , I do n't know ; I have my doubts . He was not the happiest man in the world . He was always borrowing trouble about something or another . Still , I saw some happy moments with Mr. Pepper . I was happy when I made his acquaintance , happy during our courtship , happy a while after our marriage , and happy when he died . Weeps . Hannah . Hannah Massa Pinchen , did you see my ole man Ben up dar in hebben ? Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ niggers . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines No , of course brother Pinchen did n't go among the blacks . What are you asking questions for ? Never mind , my lady , I 'll whip you well when I 'm done here . I 'll skin you from head to foot . Aside . Do go on with your heavenly conversation , brother Pinchen ; it does my very soul good . This is indeed a precious moment for me . I do love to hear of Christ and Him crucified . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Well , sister Gaines , I promised sister Daniels that I 'd come over and see her this morning , and have a little season of prayer with her , and I suppose I must go . I 'll tell you more of my religious experience when I return . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines If you must go , then I 'll have to let you ; but before you do , I wish to get your advice upon a little matter that concerns Hannah . Last week , Hannah stole a goose , killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam had a fine time eating the goose ; and her master and I would never have known a word about it , if it had not been for Cato , a faithful servant , who told his master . And then , you see , Hannah had to be severely whipped before she 'd confess that she stole the goose . Next Sabbath is sacrament day , and I want to know if you think that Hannah is fit to go to the Lord 's supper after stealing the goose . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Well , sister Gaines , that depends on circumstances . If Hannah has confessed that she stole the goose , and has been sufficiently whipped , and has begged her master 's pardon , and begged your pardon , and thinks she 'll never do the like again , why then I suppose she can go to the Lord 's supper ; for " While the lamp holds out to burn , The vilest sinner may return . " But she must be sure that she has repented , and wo n't steal any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you hear that ? For my own part , I do n't think she 's fit to go to the Lord 's supper , for she had no occasion to steal the goose . We give our niggers plenty of good wholesome food . They have a full run to the meal tub , meat once a fortnight , and all the sour milk about the place , and I 'm sure that 's enough for any one . I do think that our niggers are the most ungrateful creatures in the world , that I do . They aggravate my life out of me . Hannah . Hannah I know , missis , dat I steal de goose , and massa whip me for it , und I confess it , and I is sorry for it . But , missis , I is gwine to de Lord 's supper , next Sunday , kase I ai n't agwine to turn my back on my bressed Lord an ' Massa for no old tough goose , dat I ai n't . Weeps . Mr. P. Mr. Wildmarsh Well , sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister Daniels ; she 'll be waiting for me . Exit Mr. Pinchen , m. d . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Now , Hannah , brother Pinchen is gone , do you get the cowhide and follow me to the cellar , and I 'll whip you well for aggravating me as you have to-day . It seems as if I can never sit down to take a little comfort with the Lord , without you crossing me . The devil always puts it into your head to disturb me , just when I am trying to serve the Lord . I 've no doubt but that I 'll miss going to heaven on your account . But I 'll whip you well before I leave this world , that I will . Get the cowhide and follow me to the cellar . Exit Mrs. Gaines and Hannah , r . ACT II . Scene 1 .  --  Parlor .

I did not expect to see you up here so soon . What has hurried you ? Walk . Dick Walker Well , you see , doctor , I comes when I em not expected . The price of niggers is up , and I em gwine to take advantage of the times . Now , doctor , ef you 've got any niggers that you wants to sell , I em your man . I am paying the highest price of any body in the market . I pay cash down , and no grumblin ' . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines I do n't know that I want to sell any of my people now .

Walk . Dick Walker Yes , doctor , that is very true . The cholera is death on slaves , and a thousand dollars in your pocket is a great deal better than a nigger in the field , with cholera at his heels . Why , who is that coming up the lane ? It 's Mr. Wildmarsh , as I live ! Jest the very man I wants to see . Enter Mr. Wildmarsh . Why , how do you do , Squire ? I was jest a thinkin ' about you . Wildmarsh . Mr. Wildmarsh How are you , Mr. Walker ? and how are you , doctor ? I am glad to see you both looking so well . You seem in remarkably good health , doctor ? Dr. G.

Mr. Wildmarsh Oh , yes ; she was raised on my place , and if I could have kept her three or four years longer , and taken her to the market myself , I am sure I could have sold her for three thousand dollars . But you see , Mr. Walker , my wife got a little jealous , and you know jealousy sets the women 's heads a teetering , and so I had to sell the gal . She 's got straight hair , blue eyes , prominent features , and is almost white . Haskins will make a spec , and no mistake . Walk . Dick Walker Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw on your knee the day that your wife was gone , when I was at your place three years ago ? Wild . Mr. Wildmarsh Yes , the same . Walk . Dick Walker Well , now , Squire , I thought that was your daughter ; she looked mightily like you . She was your daughter , was n't she ? You need not be ashamed to own it to me , for I am mum upon such matters . Wild . Mr. Wildmarsh You know , Mr. Walker , that people will talk , and when they talk , they say a great deal ; and people did talk , and many said the gal was my daughter ; and you know we ca n't help people 's talking . But here comes the Rev. Mr. Pinchen ; I did n't know that he was in the neighborhood . Walk . Dick Walker It is Mr. Pinchen , as I live ; jest the very man I wants to see . Enter Mr. Pinchen , r . Why , how do you do , Mr. Pinchen ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Muddy Creek ? Any camp-meetins , revival meetins , death-bed scenes , or any thing else in your line going on down here ? How is religion prosperin ' now , Mr. Pinchen ? I always like to hear about religion . Mr. Pin . Mr. Pinchen Well , Mr. Walker , the Lord 's work is in good condition every where now . I tell you , Mr. Walker , I 've been in the gospel ministry these thirteen years , and I am satisfied that the heart of man is full of sin and desperately wicked . This is a wicked world , Mr. Walker , a wicked world , and we ought all of us to have religion . Religion is a good thing to live by , and we all want it when we die . Yes , sir , when the great trumpet blows , we ought to be ready . And a man in your business of buying and selling slaves needs religion more than any body else , for it makes you treat your people as you should . Now , there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself . Well , I converted him . Before he got religion , he was one of the worst men to his niggers I ever saw ; his heart was as hard as stone . But religion has made his heart as soft as a piece of cotton . Before I converted him , he would sell husbands from their wives , and seem to take delight in it ; but now he wo n't sell a man from his wife , if he can get any one to buy both of them together . I tell you , sir , religion has done a wonderful work for him . Walk . Dick Walker I know , Mr. Pinchen , that I ought to have religion , and I feel that I am a great sinner ; and whenever I get with good pious people like you and the doctor , and Mr. Wildmarsh , it always makes me feel that I am a desperate sinner . I feel it the more , because I 've got a religious turn of mind . I know that I would be happier with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am going to try to get it . I 'll go to a protracted meeting , and I wo n't stop till I get religion . Yes , I 'll scuffle with the Lord till I gets forgiven . But it always makes me feel bad to talk about religion , so I 'll change the subject . Now , doctor , what about them thar niggers you thought you could sell me ? Dr. Gaines . Dr. Gaines I 'll see my wife , Mr. Walker , and if she is willing to part with Hannah , I 'll sell you Sam and his wife , Hannah . Ah ! here comes my wife ; I 'll mention it . Enter Mrs. Gaines , l . Ah ! my dear , I am glad you 've come . I was just telling Mr Walker , that if you were willing to part with Hannah , I 'd sell him Sam and Hannah . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Now , Dr. Gaines , I am astonished and surprised that you should think of such a thing . You know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house servant , and now that I 've got her so that she knows my ways , you want to sell her . Hav n't you niggers enough on the plantation to sell , without selling the servants from under my very nose ? Dr. G. Dr. Gaines Oh , yes , my dear ; but I can spare Sam , and I do n't like to separate him from his wife ; and I thought if you could let Hannah go , I 'd sell them both . I do n't like to separate husbands from their wives . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines Now , gentlemen , that 's just the way with my husband . He thinks more about the welfare and comfort of his slaves , than he does of himself or his family . I am sure you need not feel so bad at the thought of separating Sam from Hannah . They 've only been married eight months , and their attachment ca n't be very strong in that short time . Indeed , I shall be glad if you do sell Sam , for then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'll have them both here under my eye . I never will again let one of my house servants marry a field hand  --  never ! For when night comes on , the servants are off to the quarters , and I have to holler and holler enough to split my throat before I can make them hear . And another thing : I want you to sell Melinda . I do n't intend to keep that mulatto wench about the house any longer . Dr. Gaines . Dr. Gaines My dear , I 'll sell any servant from the place to suit you , except Melinda . I ca n't think of selling her  --  I ca n't think of it . Mrs. G. Mrs. Gaines I tell you that Melinda shall leave this house , or I 'll go . There , now you have it . I 've had my life tormented out of me by the presence of that yellow wench , and I 'll stand it no longer . I know you love her more than you do me , and I 'll  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . Weeps . Exit Mrs. Gaines , l . Walk . Dick Walker Why , doctor , your wife 's a screamer , ai n't she ? Ha , ha , ha . Why , doctor , she 's got a tongue of her own , ai n't she ? Why , doctor , it was only last week that I thought of getting a wife myself ; but your wife has skeered the idea out of my head . Now , doctor , if you wants to sell the gal , I 'll buy her . Husband and wife ought to be on good terms , and your wife wo n't feel well till the gal is gone . Now , I 'll pay you all she 's worth , if you wants to sell . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines No , Mr. Walker ; the girl my wife spoke of is not for sale . My wife does not mean what she says ; she 's only a little jealous . I 'll get brother Pinchen to talk to her , and get her mind turned upon religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's only a little jealous . Walk . Dick Walker I tell you what , doctor , ef you call that a little jealous , I 'd like to know what 's a heap . I tell you , it will take something more than religion to set your wife right . You had better sell me the gal ; I 'll pay you cash down , and no grumblin ' . Dr. G. Dr. Gaines The girl is not for sale , Mr. Walker ; but if you want two good , able-bodied servants , I 'll sell you Sam and Big Sally . Sam is trustworthy , and Sally is worth her weight in gold for rough usage . Walk . Dick Walker Well , doctor , I 'll go out and take a look at ' em , for I never buys slaves without examining them well , because they are sometimes injured by over-work or underfeedin ' . I do n't say that is the case with yours , for I do n't believe it is ; but as I sell on honor , I must buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , and you can examine them to your heart 's content .

Dick Walker Oh , ho ! you 've got religion , have you ? That 's so much the better . I likes to deal in the gospel . I think he 'll suit me . Now , mer gal , what 's your name ? Sally .

Dr. Gaines You may have Sam for $1000 , and Sally for $900 . They are worth all I ask for them . You know I never banter , Mr. Walker . There they are ; you can take them at that price , or let them alone , just as you please . Walk . Dick Walker Well , doctor , I reckon I 'll take ' em ; but it 's all they are worth . I 'll put the handcuffs on ' em , and then I 'll pay you . I likes to go accordin ' to Scripter .

I 'd like to have your company ; for I allers likes the company of preachers . Mr. Pinchen . Mr. Pinchen Well , Mr. Walker , I would be much pleased to go down the river with you , but it 's too early for me . I expect to go to Natchez in four or five weeks , to attend a camp-meetin ' , and if you were going down then , I 'd like it . What kind of niggers sells best in the Orleans market , Mr. Walker ?
