Characters . STELLA . HATTIE . OLIVE . RUTH . LUCY . SUSAN . SCHOOL-GIRLS . Main text SCENE I. A school play-ground.  --  Enter Stella , Olive , Lucy , and Ruth . STELLA .  --  You may say what you please , girls , I will never consent to have Harriet Cook invited to our picnic ; it is to be quite a select affair , and I for one do not choose to associate with drunkard 's children . She has no business in our school at all . The public school is the place for her  --  mother says so . She is surprised that Miss Harrington takes her . LUCY .  --  But it is no fault of hers , Stella , that her father drinks ; I am sure she is one of the nicest , sweetest girls in school , and one of the best scholars too . I am sure she has helped you often enough over your arithmetic , to have you speak more kindly of her . STELLA .  --  Dear me ! I do not know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that account . My father is very particular whom I associate with . You ought to have seen old Jimmy Cook staggering home the other night ; he went past our house with a pack of boys following him , pulling his hair and teasing him in every way they could . It was funny to see him clutch after them , and try to strike them ; but the boys were too quick for him . They only shouted and laughed , and told him to try again . I laughed till I cried , and father came and stood beside me , and laughed too , as heartily as I did . OLIVE .  --  Poor , poor Hattie ! I do hope she did not see him . STELLA .  --  But she did , I know , for I saw her on the opposite side of the street , hurrying on with her vail pulled over her face . I hoped she would not put on quite so many airs after it , and think herself as good as any body else , but it do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Indignantly . ) For shame , Stella ! Have you no heart ? As if it was the poor girl 's fault ; and as for putting on airs , that is what Hattie never does ; she only maintains a decent self-respect , if she does carry an aching heart in her breast . We should be careful about rejoicing over the misfortunes of another , for trouble may come to us when we look for it the least . STELLA .  --  Dear me , what a croaker ! I presume now she expects my father to turn drunkard , and go reeling through the streets , just because I laughed at Jimmy Cook . My father is a gentleman , and would never stoop to anything so degrading as to drink low , poisoned liquors . He never has anything but the finest wines on his side-board , and they are often four or five dollars a bottle . RUTH .  --  But people can become intemperate just as well on wine as on whiskey . It is not a whit less dangerous . STELLA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know it is quite a fashion for ladies to lecture . You are tall and good-looking , and a good elocutionist , and I know you would make quite a sensation . RUTH .  --  My first point will be , then , to urge you all to be kind to the drunkard 's children . By all means let us ask Hattie to our picnic , and make the day as bright as we can for her . STELLA .  --  ( Much offended . ) Then you will have to dispense with my company , I assure you . RUTH .  --  We will try and bear it with as much resignation as possible . STELLA .  --  You are very sarcastic , Miss Davis ; but I can tell you , mother shall not send the elegant basket of cake she has prepared for it , nor a single strawberry from our vines . OLIVE .  --  Oh ! do n't worry about that , dear ; we have more strawberries and cake promised than we can possibly use . But , Stella , think better of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure , and you know you need n't speak a word to Hattie if you do n't want to . Only do n't treat her rudely , for that is very wrong , and I know it would offend half the girls in school ; they all love Hattie . STELLA .  --  ( Leaving angrily . ) They are welcome to  --  a drunkard 's daughter , indeed ! I think things have come to a pretty pass in our school when she is preferred before a gentleman 's daughter . RUTH .  --  Worth before station any time , Stella . ( Exit Stella , slamming the door . ) LUCY .  --  You were almost too hard , Ruth . RUTH .  --  I know it , but her airs are unendurable . But , poor girl , she may see sorrow herself , before many days . Her father spends nearly all his evenings at the club , and plays and takes wine most immoderately . I do not think she suspects such a thing as that he can possibly be in danger . But girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming up the walk . She likes to have us all in our places as soon as the bell rings . ( Exit girls  --  a bell ringing . ) SCENE II . Recitation Room .  --  Hattie , Olive , Lucy weaving wreaths for the picnic . OLIVE .  --  Hattie , please help me twine in this myrtle ; I can never get it to suit myself , but your fingers have the knack of making every thing fit in right . HATTIE.  --  I think you are doing very well , Olive , but I will help you if I can . There , how will that please you ? How lovely those carnations are ! Look , girls . ( She fits the wreath on Olive 's head . ) LUCY .  --  It is perfect . Do n't stir a leaf , Hattie . But here comes Susan Lee . Do , pray , girls , be careful what you say , she does make so much trouble repeating things ; and it seems to me nothing ever goes on that she does n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , are all the flowers I had time to gather . Mother sent me over to Mrs. Nippers ' to get the particulars of that awful affair that 's just happened , and I was tired clear out when I came home . GIRLS .  --  What awful affair ? Do tell us ! Anybody killed ? SUSAN .  --  Well , not quite , I suppose , but pretty near . It all happened at that club , which was thought to be such a wonderfully aristocratic affair . Stella 's father , you know , is called one of the best players at cards in town ; nobody ever beats him . But it happened that he was playing with a gentleman who had not been very long in the club , and they say he lost and lost , oh ! I ca n't tell you how much money ; but the more he lost the more angry he got , and risked larger and larger sums , until the man swept all his property . Then he told the man he was a cheat and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stella 's father is a large , strong man , and the other was very slight , so he was very much hurt before any one could or would interfere . Some people say the man will die , but I ca n't pretend to say . But one thing we are sure of , Mr. Rosylin is safe in jail and I guess Stella wo n't hold her head quite go high , and lord it over the rest of us quite so much as she used to . OLIVE .  --  Hush , Susan , do , Do n't let us speak hard things of her , now she is in such trouble . I am sure I pity her with all my heart . HATTIE.  --  Poor Stella ! I would do any thing in the world I could to comfort her . SUSAN .  --  I guess it would comfort her the most never to see the face of one of us again . You certainly do n't owe her any good-will , Hattie , of all the rest . HATTIE.  --  I am sure I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry for her trouble ; most likely the story is much exaggerated . SUSAN .  --  Most likely the half is not known . LUCY .  --  Well , whatever the truth proves to be , girls , we will always treat Stella as kindly as ever ; for , whatever she may have maintained to the contrary , children are not responsible for the faults of their parents . They may suffer for them , but they are not to blame for them . But now we must gather up our wreaths , girls , for the carriages are coming , and we can finish them in the woods . ( Exeunt , omnes )
