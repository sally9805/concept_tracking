Mr. Fergus Derrick ( indicating note ) Yes , here it is in plain language . ( reads ) " Mester Derik , th ' rools is bin broak agen on th ' quiet bi them as broak ' em afore  --  I naim noa names  --  an ' would n't say nowt about it only our lives is in danger . I ax you to watch out . I am respectfully an honest man wi ' a family to feed . " Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale It 's astonishing what large families these honest men do have to feed ! But what rule has been broken ? Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Only a false key obtained for the Davy lamp ; only that lamp opened , in the midst of the eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men in peril because one selfish brute must have a smoke ! Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Why , do you mean to tell me they will open the lamp and run that terrible risk  --  Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Merely to light a pipe ! Yes ! Is n't it almost incredible ? It was through that I sprain 'd my wrist eight or nine days ago . I caught Phil Lowrie , Liz 's father  --  her father  --  with his lamp open , and in a scuffle for the false key the brute struck me , and we had a fight for it . I have n't lost all the manly education I got at college with my Latin and mathematics , and I came out of the struggle a conqueror . But he owes me a grudge for it , and he is capable of a brutal revenge . Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale He is . Be on your guard , Derrick . He is the worst man in Riggan . He wo n't listen to a word from me . Der . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the rector too , if you " worried " him too much in trying , as you parsons put it , " to bring him to a proper sense of his condition ! " Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale What a contrast he is to his daughter ! Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick To " Liz , " as everybody calls he  --  Liz , with her splendid figure , of which every pose is grace and strength combined ; her sun-brown 'd , beautiful throat , her sculptur 'd arms , her masses of brown hair , her sad , sweet , honest eyes , her full , frank voice , her  --  ( crosses , l . ) Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Why , Derrick , you are quite enthusiastic . One would think you were an artist instead of an engineer  --  Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick That 's the word , she is artistic . She stands out against this sad prosaic background  --  a splendid glint of sunshine , lighting up all the sombre shadows of the picture . Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has labour 'd at the pit 's mouth from her childhood , curs 'd with poverty , privation , hard work , and , above all , with that terrible drunken father , who has often lifted his frenzied hand against the girl herself . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick For the last time , if Fergus Derrick is " to the fore ! " Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Liz Lowrie stands apart from all the other women of Riggan . She has some of the faults of her class , but none of their follies ; she is half-fear 'd , half-worshipp 'd . The man who should approach her with the coarse love-making in fashion among them , would rue it and remember it to the last day of his life . She seems to be all in all to herself and repels everybody . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick And is it impossible to win upon her ? Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale More than impossible ! I felt myself a child in her hands when I tried to talk to her of the better life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me like the rest . She stood before me as firm as a rock , never speaking a word till I had finished . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick And then ? and then ? Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale She quietly said , " Parson ! if tha 'll leave me alone , I 'll leave thee alone ! " And then she quietly turned about and walk 'd into the house . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick ( laughing ) Having wip 'd you and your sermon out with half-a-dozen crushing words ! Such a father ! such a daughter ! Extremes meet , indeed ! But how is it she does n't leave him ? Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale " Duty " is the first rule with her . I often think if she had had the same training as that received by Anice  --  I mean Miss Barholm . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick ( smiling ) Oh , say Anice . You can trust me with your timid secret , if you do not confide it to her . Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the daughter  --  Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick ( pompously ) Of Johnston Barholm , Esq. , mine owner , landed proprietor , late member of Parliament , and always worshipper of " facts . " Whom Nature has taken care of from his cradle . " Silver spoon ! "  --  he was born with a golden spoon in his mouth ; and gold spoon he has remain 'd . As many carat gold as you like , but no hall-mark of real intellect , real heartiness , real goodness  --  real anything , but the real yellow dross ! How dare you , indeed , dream of marrying Mr. Barholm 's heiress ? Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Well , Derrick , you might spare me ! Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Spare you ! I 'll encourage you ! The heart you 've laid siege to is no forlorn hope , man ; if it is , count me your lieutenant in the storming of it . Noise outside , e. l. 1 e. ; Nan 's voice heard , " Let me a-be ! let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ u. e. , pursued by Women , with baby . Derrick and Lonsdale retire to r. , Derrick holding Lonsdale back .

I know it too well . 1st Woman . 1st Woman ( getting louder ) Go back to London wi ' thee ; we 'll none ha ' thee here . Off wi ' ye ! ( menaces ) All . All ( attacking her ) Away wi ' ye ! Nan . Nan ( strugglin g ) Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liz Lowrie ( outside ) Nan , Nan ! Liz rushes on through the crowd ; snatches a bit of a shawl from a girl , who had previously torn it from Nan , etc . Takes Nan under her protection , and with erect figure and flaming eyes confronts her tormentors . Liz . Liz Lowrie What ha ' they bin a sayin ' to yo ' , lass ? What ha ' they bin a doin ' at yo ' ? Eh , but yo 're a brave lot  --  yo are . Women ! yo ' ca ' yor'esens ! badgerin ' a slip of a wench like this ! Back ! Nan . Nan I want nowt frae them . ( sobbing and clinging to Liz ) Save me from ' em . Do n't let ' em drive me away . Liz . Liz Lowrie ( pointing compassionately at child ) Lasses , women , do yo ' see this ? A bit o ' a helpless thing as canna answer back yo 're jeers ! Ay ! look at it well , aw on yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , look at the mother ! Seventeen year old Nan is , and the world 's gone wrong wi ' her . I wonnot say as the world 's gone ower reet wi ' any on us . But them on us as ha ' had the strength to howd up agen it needna set the foot on them as ha ' gone down . Happen theer 's na so much to choose atwixt any on us , after a ' . So leave her aloan , if you can , an ' if yo ' ca n't , I 've gotten this to tell yo ' : them as has owt to say to poor Nan here must say it first to Liz Lowrie . Women gradually retire . Derrick and Lonsdale come forward . Liz approaches Derrick hesitatingly and slowly . Nan sits at back . Liz . Liz Lowrie ( to Derrick ) I ha ' summat to ax yo ' . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick If there is anything I can do for you  --  Liz . Liz Lowrie ( decisively ) It 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fain to help , if I can do it ; but I have na ' the power .

Mr. Fergus Derrick Yes ; well ? Liz . Liz Lowrie So I thowt I 'd ax yo ' to speak to him about the wench , and ax him if he could get her a bit o ' work as ' ud help her to live , and keep her  --  keep her  --  honest . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick It was very good , very brave , and very right in you to defend this girl as you did just now . I  --  Liz . Liz Lowrie I dunnot believe in harrying women down th ' hill ; and poor little Nan  --  so young , so helpless  --  I canna be the thowt o ' what might fa ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again , wi'out somebody to look up to , like ; I can not bide the thowt o ' it .

Arthur Lonsdale Fergus , congratulate me ! Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick I congratulate you both . ( taking both their hands ) But ( to her ) what will your father say ? An . Anice Barholm What I say ! he 's a very good father ; he always does what I tell him ; and I have been modulating his mind to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Lonsdale You have ? Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick You have ! ( smiling ) But how could you possibly imagine Lonsdale would consent ? Of course you proposed to him . An . Anice Barholm Mr. Derrick ! Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Fergus , how could you propose  --  I mean suppose  --  Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Calm yourself , Lonsdale , the crisis is over now , and the patient ( taking Lonsdale 's hand , feeling pulse ) in a fair way of recovering from an interesting attack . Here ( indicating Anice ) is the prescription that cures  --  to be taken  --  Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale For life , Fergus ! ( takes Anice 's arm under his ) Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick And a very nice arrangement too . ( to Anice ) But how did you discover the tender secret ? I am sure he very skilfully concealed his feelings . An . Anice Barholm ( smiling ) Did he ? Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick He did . But you as skilfully discovered them . And yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the keenest eyes and the quickest ears of all the Olympian deities . An . Anice Barholm Has he , indeed , Mr. Self-satisfied ? Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Cupid appears to me not only blind , but dumb too , in your case . Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Justifiably blind and justifiably dumb . An . Anice Barholm Wilfully so , let us say , you stupid engineer . Do n't you know how Liz tended you through your almost mortal illness ; how she with her strong arms and constant soul stood night and day between you and death , and battled with him while you lay there the fainting prize for which they fought ? Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick ( earnestly ) I do know , I do know . The world has no truer , nobler woman than Liz Lowrie . I owe my life to her twice over . She has opened up to me a new world with new hopes , a new ambition . I love her , Anice , I love her . And yet I seem to be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a stern pride in her very humility . Yet in the intensity of her devotion there is surely the warmth of a higher feeling . In spite of her lowly birth , her homely ways , I seem to look up to her . She is to me as the speck of daylight which appears to the miner like a star , when he looks up the murky shaft to the distant sky . I wondered at Lonsdale that he dared not hazard all with you in one short question , and yet I can not speak . ( walks up ) An . Anice Barholm Oh dear , oh dear ! you silly men ! What is to be done , Arthur ? The symptoms are as clear  --  Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale On both sides . An . Anice Barholm As they were in our case . And it 's no use thinking of poor old Sammy Craddock 's dissolute island for them . I wish she 'd come . ( looking at her watch ) She was to have been here by this time . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall ) She is coming . Go into the house , Arthur . I may as well lose no time in commencing my wifely habits of command . I have an idea . Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Sure to be a good one . Derrick rejoins them . An . Anice Barholm Ah , you have faith in my judgment now . ( he kisses her hand ) Go into the house . And you , sir , surrender your engineer 's diploma to me , and let me scheme a little . Go to the other side of the hedge and attend to a conversation I am going to have with another of my  --  superior sex . Go , both of you . Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Delightful tyrant ! ( Exit ) Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick Little despot . ( Exit , laughing , through gate in hedge ) Enter slowly at door or arch-like entrance , c. , Liz , dressed for travelling , and with small bundle . It is to be noted that she is here neatly dressed , her manner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An . Anice Barholm ( running to meet her ) Liz , dear Liz , I am so glad you are come . But what does this mean ? ( pointing to bonnet ) and this ? ( to bundle ) Liz . Liz Lowrie It means that I 've bid good-bye to Riggan , and I 'm come to say good-bye . ( sighing ) Good-bye to you , Miss Anice ! An . Anice Barholm To say good-bye ! Oh no , no , do n't say that . Liz . Liz Lowrie Yes , yes , it must be , Miss Anice , it must be . I canna bide any longer in Riggan . I want to get away from it  --  from him . An . Anice Barholm From him ! do you mean from Mr. Derrick ? Liz . Liz Lowrie I do mean Mr. Derrick ! I thought I 'd try and settle down to the new work you got for me , the sewing and that , and the night-school for the children . I thought I was strong enough to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul ; but I canna , canna . The daily sight of him , the daily hearing of his footstep as he goes by my window ; the daily talking about him that I hear from the neighbours , try me more than I can bear ; so I mun break loose from it all . I want to forget the owd life as far as I can . I 'm goin ' now because I do n't want to be ask 'd questions . An . Anice Barholm Have you seen Mr. Lonsdale ? Liz . Liz Lowrie No , I sha n't have chance to say good-bye to him ; I cum to ax you to say it for me . An . Anice Barholm Yes , if I must ; but I should like to keep you , Liz . Liz . Liz Lowrie I have been thinkin ' of Nan ; I thow't I 'd ask you ( pause ) if it were to happen as she drifted back here while I were away , to say a kind word to her , and say as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from the bottom o ' my soul . An . Anice Barholm I will , I will . But change your mind , Liz , do n't go . Liz . Liz Lowrie It 's no use talking to me , Miss Anice ; I 'm goin ' away , an ' this very morning ! An . Anice Barholm No , no ; we can not spare you ; Riggan can not spare you . He can not spare you . Liz . Liz Lowrie Maybe he 'll think of me for a bit ; an ' then  --  then happen he 'll try and forget me ; he must ; it 's his place to forget me . An . Anice Barholm Forget you he never will . " His place " to forget you ! Liz , it 's " his place " never to forget you ! Liz . Liz Lowrie Nay , nay ; we must part ! An . Anice Barholm No , I will not hear of it ; I know you love him . Liz . Liz Lowrie ( with intensity ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anice Barholm All heard you say , " There 's a mon down that pit "  --  Liz . Liz Lowrie ( with fervour ) " As I 'd give my heart 's blood to save . " And I would , I would ! An . Anice Barholm Do n't you remember how he talk 'd of you in his delirium , when he was out of his mind ? Liz . Liz Lowrie When he was out of his mind ! Nay , nay ; he was in his right mind at times ; and it 's because I do remember what he said then , that I 'm going away . I think Fergus Derrick loves me  --  An . Anice Barholm Think ! You may be sure he does . Liz . Liz Lowrie I am sure ; and it 's as much grief to me as joy ; as much gladness as sorrow . It 's true , Miss Anice , as he said , " Liz , my dear Liz , my dear wife ; " but then , at other times , and oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Marry her ! no , no , I can not ; a pit girl ; what will the world say  --  my world ! how can I make my friends her 's ! No , no ; I must not , can not marry her . " Those words fell here like blows . ( hand on heart ) And once , when he was saying them , I leaned over him , and as my tears fell on his face , I stopped the cruel speech with a kiss , the only one I ever give him , and the only one I ever shall ! An . Anice Barholm Oh , Liz , do not think of what he said ; he was not master of himself then . Liz . Liz Lowrie P'raps not ; p'raps not . But he was right ! What would the world say when he took Liz Lowrie , the pitgirl , to ' em , and said this is my wife ? And it 's because I love him so time and so fond that I wo n't bring him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all my heart and soul that I say what he said . He can not  --  must not  --  marry Liz Lowrie , for she 's outside his hedge , like she was yours ! An . Anice Barholm But you 're inside the hedge now , my dear Liz  --  Der . Mr. Fergus Derrick ( rushing through ) And there she shall remain for ever , with me , if she will . Liz Lowrie , I ask you in my right mind  --  never so right as now  --  in my clear senses  --  never more unclouded  --  I ask you , with all the deep sincerity of a man who loves for the first time , and that with all his heart , to become my wife . ( Lonsdale , who has also heard all this , comes forward and says ) Lons . Rev. Arthur Lonsdale Bless you , my children ! ( Anice kisses him . Liz on Derrick 's breast ) Jud .
