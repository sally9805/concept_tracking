txt ART . VI . - The Life of Thomas Jefferson . By HENRY S. RANDALL , LL . ID . New York : Derby and Jackson . 1858. 3 vols. 8vo . WE have already given a critical notice of this work and we now return to it not for the purpose of giving it a thorough examination , still less for that of reopening old subjects of controversy connected with the name of the distinguished man whose career it records . We propose to say a few words concerning the personal character of Mr. Jefferson , leaving his // political principles and measures to other tribunals , and a future epoch . The ch5acters of her great men are a part of the nation 's wealth . For a time , while party conflict rages , the people may seem indifferent to this portion of their possessions ; nay , one half of them may appear to take pride in destroying it . But the lapse of a generation or two removes much that is extraneous and accidental from the history of the conspicuous agents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on inferences , pass into oblivion ; and acts that were viewed with abhorrence when recent are seen in retrospect to have been excusable , innocent , and even praiseworthy . Such has been the case with regard to Mr. Jefferson . It is not to be denied , that in this part of the country , fifty years ago , by many whose opinion was entitled to respect , he was held in very low esteem ; and that the usual bitterness of political animosity was increased in regard to him by an infusion of theological odium . He was considered as a representative of that school of infidel philosophers whose writings were thought to have been chiefly instrumental in producing the French Revolution , with all its horrors . Those horrors were so atrocious as to alienate from the side of the reformers almost all those Englishmen and Americans who had hailed the dawning of the Revolution with delight . Wordsworth is a type of the English , and Washington of the American friends of liberty , whose hopes were thus rudely dashed , and their sympathies turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England there had probably never been so ardent or so general a hope as in other sections of this country , and the unanimity of abhorrence was consequently greater . Add to this , that our population was very deeply imbued with the religious character of the Puritans . An avowed infidel , except among persons utterly disreputable , was not to be found . The only question of religious faith was of more or less ; all professed belief in the main doctrines of Christianity . What then must have been their horror when they saw the uprising of a great nation , apparently united in rebellion against God himself ! It required extraordinary strength of reason and coolness of judgment to avoid involving the actors in those scenes , // with all their abettors and apologists , in one indiscriminate condemnation . And if there were still any to plead in Mr. Jefferson 's behalf , that , though he had , like Franklin and Lafayette , been of one mind with the early promoters of the Revolution , he was by no means to be held an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , - that he left France before the accession to power of the mcii of violence and blood , - it was urged on the other hand that he made no secret of his sympathy with Priestley and others who were driven from England for their revolutionary practices ; and , more tWan all , with Thomas Paine , the arch-infidel and Jacobin . It is a curious fact , that the hatred of individuals on account of their opinions has always exceeded in intensity that resulting from any other cause . In proof of this the burnings , massacres , and executions perpetrated in religious persecutions may be cited , as also the rancorous aversion which has separated neighbors and fellow-citizens from one another in political contests . It may be doubted whether even a personal injury sustained from Mr. Jefferson would have wrought in some minds such detestation of him as was cansed by the knowledge or supposition that he held certain obnoxious theoretical views . This feeling is not unfruitful ; it can not find vent in action , but it does in words ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most atrocious charges were made and admitted against his personal character . We do not attribute such slanders to intentional misrepresentation . They are first hinted as legitimate inferences from avowed opinions , then repeated as current reports , and finally asserted as facts . There were , perhaps , no two men in our Revolutionary era more diametrically opposed to each other than Mr. Jefferson and Lord North . The latter was commonly regarded in this country as the embodiment of all the cruelty and oppression of which our people complained . The language of his opponents in his own land was harsh and condemnatory in the highest degree , and it fell , in this country , on willing ears and minds prepared to believe it . The unsuccessful results of his administration silenced the friends who might have stood up // 110 July , in his defence , so that the prevailing impression respecting him , both at home and here , was that he was a statesman without capacity , and a man of hard heart and violent temper . Publie opinion continued thus for more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brougham , being engaged in preparing " Historical Sketches of the Statesmen of the iReign of George III. , " applied to Lady Charlotte Lindsay , the daughter of Lord North , for information respecting her father . She replied to him in a charming letter , bearing the impress of truth in every line , and describing the character , not of an obstinate imbecile or of a ruthless oppressor , but of a gentle*nan of great excellence in private life and of more than average ability , whose wit and good humor made him a general favorite . The war with this countrywas not approved of by him , though he sustained it in Parliament , solely in deference to the wishes of the King . This was a serious error , and a blot upon his character ; but it should be alleged in his excuse , that , for three years before his retirement from office , he had made repeated attempts to resign , which were put aside by the King with promises that he would consent to part with him as soon as he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following passages from Lady Charlotte Lindsay 's letter depict her father 's character . After describing his social qualities , she says - " Yet I think that he had really more enjoyment when he went into the country , on a Saturday and Sunday , with only his own family or one or two intimate friends : he then entered into all the jokes and fun of his elder children , was the cornpanioa and intimate friend of his sons and daughters , and the merry , entertaining playfellow of his little girl the writer herself , who was five years younger than any of the others . To his servants he was a most kind and indulgent master : if provoked by stupidity or impertinence , a few hasty , impatient words might escape him ; but I *never saw him really out of humor . " And again - " Lord North was a truly pious Christian ; yet his religion was quite free from bigotry or intolerance , and consisted more in the beautiful spirit of Christian benevolence than in outward and formal observances . His character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that of any human being can be ; and those actions of his public life // which appear to have been the most questionable , proceeded , I am entirely convinced , from what one must own was a weakness , though not an unamiable one , and which followed him through his life , the want of power to resist the influence of those he loved . " This was the , man of whom his great antagonist , Mr. Fox , in the heat of debate , could allow himself to say , " Such was his opinion of the Minister , that he should deem it unsafe to be alone with him in a room " * Lord North 's antagonist , Mr. Jefferson , has been viewed with even more bitter feelings , in virtue of the law above alluded to , according to which hatred for opinion 's sake exceeds in intensity all other hatred . And yet it is hard it should be so , in his case especially ; for he was the first of all men in authority to announce the sentiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason is left free to combat it . " He has been represented as a demagogue and intriguer , in fine , a person imbued with French principles , which in that day were interpreted to mean atheism in religion , mob-rule in politics , and dissoluteness in morals . On this foundation was built up a conception of him in . which no feature of atrocity was wanting ; and though this language is strong , those who remember the party literature of fifty years ago will acknowledge that it is not exaggerated . The publication of Mr. Jefferson 's Writings in 1829 did much to change the impression of his character in the minds of the younger portion of his countrymen , and they saw with surprise that this man , so held in abhorrence , had been engaged during his whole career ' in laying open his heart to his numerous correspondents , avowing most freely his opinions on public events and on abstract topics , and that no unworthy sentiment , no base motives , no selfish views , could be traced in a single line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible for a skilful hypocrite to veil his baseness during almost incessant communications by the pen , but it would still be a question whether those who lived in constant intercourse with him might not tell , if they would , a different story . Bad temper , // bad morals , bad ends sought by bad means , would make themselves visible in private life , though not on the written page . Could we have the testimony of those who saw the man most closely and for the longest time , we should then have the means of knowing his true character . We now have this testimony . Mr. iRandall has produced it for us ; by direct questioning of Mr. Jefferson 's descendants , whose replies are spread before us in his book . The principal of these replies are from Mr. Jefferson 's granddaughters , who were brought up by him , and grew to maturity in habits of daily intercourse with him . To one of these ladies in particular , who resides in this city , we are indebted for the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thoughts , and feelings . These pictures are of an historical value ; it is of incalculable importance to the true representation of that momentous era , that they should have been drawn , and placed , before it was too late , where they will be preserved for the student of our history in future times . They ' are of the highest interest , and exhibit precisely such aspects of the individual as we need for forming a judgment of his actual self . It is vain to say that they are colored by personal partiality , for whence could that personal partiality have arisen , except from the very traits of character which the letters de-scribe ? The letters to which we allude are found chiefly in the third volume of Mr. Randall 's Life . We would gladly make extracts from them , but we have the higher privilege of printing for the first time some further communications from the same pen , which relate to topics not introduced , or not so fully treated , in Mr. Randall 's work . We first copy a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who wa* then preparing a work on the United States . " SIR , - " It is more than two months since , through the kind agency of Dr. Carus , I was gratified by the permission to read that part of your unpublished work on America which relates to the public and private life of my grandfather , Mr. Jefferson . Dr. Cams informed me that you were willing to receive any observations I might be disposed to offer , and that you even wished such observations to be made and comniuni // cated to you . I should have written immediately to thank you for the great pleasure I derived , even through the imperfect medium of translation , from your manuscript , hut a long and enfeebling indisposition has hitherto prevented me from consulting my own wishes in this respect . Even now I can do little more than express my unqualified approbation of the manner in which you have performed a difficult task . " Mr. Jefferson 's administration as President , and indeed his whole career as a public man , is closely associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States . The great question , to what extent man is capable of self-government , divides more or less the civilized world . Mr. Jefferson was in America the head and representative of that party who believe that the only way to prevent the abuse of power is to lodge it in the hands of the many , whose interest it must be to consult the interests of all . Whatever form the contest may assume , the principle is still the same , and with this principle are bound up too many passions and too many prejudice* not to excite the fiercest discussions and the bitterest animosities . Mr. Jefferson 's name in America has been the watchword of party . On one side it has awakened all the resentment of his unsuccessful opponents ; on the other , it has been too often abused to cover the perversities of pretended friends ; and whilst few men of modern times have had more dcvoted adherents , or more rancorous opponents , none have found it more impossible to obtain even-handed justice . Under such circumstances , I congratulate you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have discovered and declared the truth . Indeed , from the specimen which this chapter of your work affords of the whole , I can not but hope that it will give to the world , what the world has never yet had , correct ideas of the political and social state of the great and yet almost nnknown republic of the United States of America . Few nations of the globe are more talked of , or less understood . You seem to have placed yourself on high ground , and to have examined from a cornmanding position the workings of the vast and yet simple machinery which controls this free and energetic people . Where others see only confusion , you have distinguished order , and you have , no doubt , discovered that the aberrations and apparently irregular movements of our political system are , to a certain extent , periodical , and that the system contains within itself the principle of self-adjustment . " To return to the immediate subject of my letter . Few persons better than myself can appreciate your just estimate of Mr. Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the hourly witness of his every-day life , and felt to the full extent the beneficial influence of his home virtues . A being more free from defect in the domestic rela10 * // tions of life , it has never been my fortune to know ; and it is no exaggerated panegyric , but a simple truth , when I declare that I can not recollect , in my whole intercourse with him , nor in what I know of his intercourse with others , one instance of injustice or unkindness , nor one neglected opportunity of contributing to the happiness of those in immediate connection with himself . His grandchildren , from the age when they climbed lovingly on his knee , to the time when they became his friends and favorite companions , felt for him the utmost degree of affection , reverence , and admiration which it is in the human heart to feel . His friends and neighbors looked up to him with warm attachment and unbounded respect , and his slaves regarded him with the loyal devotion of faithful subjects . Several among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free . He had promised it to those among them who , possessing a trade by which they could suppo*rt themselves , ran no risk of falling burdens on the community , or of being reduced to unlawful means of living . Yet these men , far from wishing to hasten the hour of their liberation , were the most afflicted at his death . His own servant , a man who had waited on him with the most faithful affection during the last seventeen years of his life , was of this number . " Confidence in his fellow-men was the characteristic of Mr. Jefferson 's temper , - a confidence which his long and varied intercourse with them never disturbed . He believed in the general healthfulness and good proportions of the human intellect and moral conformation ; and that the great Creator had made man neither in mind nor body a cramped and distorted being . Mr. Jefferson thought moral deformity as rare as bodily , and as much the effect of accident and mismanagement . He took it then for granted that men were fit to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct of their own interests . I have sometimes thought that his opinions on this subject were influenced by his own peculiarly happy constitution of body and mind . He had himself so much to be grateful for to Nature , that he could not understand her playing the stepmother with others . He enjoyed , for seventy-five years or more , almost uninterrupted health . He was strong and active in body , vigorous in understanding , sanguine , cheerful , patient , and laborious . He made no demand on his own faculties to which they did not respond . He was capable of the most persevering effort , and had a firmness of purpose , a fixedness of intent , which I have seldom seen equalled . My mother said of him , that he was never known to give up a point or a friend . He certainly adhered to his principles and to his party with undeviating constancy . INor could he feel to any great extent the annoyance arising from being // JEFFERSON ' S PRIVATE CHARACTER . thwarted in his own views by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted on the minds of all connected with him , and he exercised over all that sort of control which resolution and self-possession , ardor a energy , invariably exercise . These qualities , combined with kindness of temper and courtesy of manners , made him too powerful with his party not to leave him , in the eyes of his opponents , accountable for all the mortification of their own defeat . " He could , from his own character and habits , make little allowance for the deficiencies which arise from a weak will . It was remarked , that , when consulted by his friends on the education of their sons , he frequently imposed tasks on the young men which were considered unreasonably severe . In his youth he had been himself so fully equal to such efforts , that he could not easily comprehend how much they were often above the reach of natures less robust than his own . I have known him lay down for a young lady a course of reading which might have startled a university student . " In private society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was uniformly kind , considerate , and thoughtful of the wishes of others , too courteous to give pain even in trifles , too just not to render to each man his due , and too benevolent not to contribute all in his power to the comfort and satisfaction of all who came within his reach . His powers of conversation were considerable . He was frank , open , and not in the smallest degree overbearing . Young and old took . pleasure in his society ; and with young and old he conversed readily , cheerfully , and with a most sympathetic spirit ; entering into their habits of thought , answering their questions , and putting them completely at their ease , except when inveterate pre*judice , or preconceived and stubborn opinion , refused to unbend or to believe . " But I have already almost exceeded the limits of a letter . I will , therefore , only renew my thanks for the justice you have rendered to the memory of one most dear to me , and the pleasure you have procured me by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , to accept the assurance of my highest consideration . " E. W. C**% " The following letter was written in 1834 , in answer to one from a political friend of Mr. Jefferson , who wished to exculpate him from the charge of infidelity in religion - " TIe called himself a Christian . He always said that he was a Christian in what he understood to be the right sense of the word , and according to the doctrines which he believed to be truly those of Jesus . // His character , in spite of the mistakes which prevail among many persons with regard to it , was essentially Christian , and could have been formed under no other influences than those of the Gospel . He was , if ever man was , merciful , pure in heart , a peace-maker , one who forgave his enemies , not seven times , but seventy times seven , doing his alms in secret , and praying , not at the corners of the streets , but in the retirement of his closet . His religious opinions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained the greatest possible admiration and veneration for the character and doctrines of Jesus , and few persons , not theologians , of those who possess most leisure , devote more time than he did to the reading of the New Testament . He frequently had recourse to it in his moments of retirement , and never more than when , under the pressure of sorrow , he sought the rest which is offered to the heavy-laden . Upon one occasion , having experienced an affliction of the severest kind , the loss of a very dear daughter , he was found by his only surviving child , my mother , when she first ventured to interrupt the retirement of his grief with the sacred volume in his hand ; and in this he continued to read , at intervals , sometimes aloud to her , the whole time during which the agony of his feelings absorbed all thoughts but those which even then he could give to th' words of the Saviour . " Nor was his study of the Scriptures entirely confined to the New Testament . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most fervent admiration . I have heard him repeat from memory the most beautiful parts of David 's lamentation over Saul and Jonathan , the mourning over Absalom , as well as several of the Psalms , such as the fifteenth and twenty-third ; and the metrical version of the fifteenth , Lord , who s the happy man , ' &amp;c. , I have seen in more than one place written out in his own hand . He was also in the habit of copying out such occasional hymns as pleased and satisfied him , and I have one or two of these , written on small scraps of paper , which I carefully preserve . It may be worth while to mention , that his voice and manner were particularly impressive when he read aloud , as he sometimes did , passages from the New Testament , or repeated the Psalms . There was a feeling and earnestness in his tones which corresponded with the solemnity of the subject . Of sacred music he was particularly fond , and especially of the old Psalm tunes , which he regretted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before more modern compositions . His voice continued singularly sweet and unbroken to the last years of his life ; and I have frequently heard him singing to himself passages of psalms and hymns , such as he had sung in his youth . lie was as regular an attendant at church as circumstances permitted , and frequently // overcame obstacles of weather and roads which might have deterred younger men . He preferred the Liturgy of the Church of England to any other form of worship , and always kept by him the Book of Common Prayer . " Such indications as these of a habit of respect and affection for many things considered sacred , are more worthy of notice , because Mr. Jefferson is well known to have been a fearless and uncompromising man , paying small regard either to persons or to what he considered prejudices . His w'orst enemies have never , I believe , accused him of hypocrisy , and his assertions of independence , both in speech and action , have often subjected him to misrepresentation and mistake . lie was particularly sturdy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abhorrence all attempts to establish anything like an inquisition over free thought , particularly on matters which , far beyond human jurisdiction , lie between man and his God , to whom only he should be required to render his account . But to friendly inquiry , or even admonition , Mr. Jefferson was always open and gentle , and I have been pleased and surprised to see what different impressions from those which they brought , good and pious persons would often carry away after long and frank conversation with Mr. Jefferson , on topics of which he equally with themselves admitted the importance , although his individual views might be different from their own . " With regard to Mr. Jefferson 's belief in a future state , he has himself expressly declared it in more than one of his writings . I refer to several of his published letters , - such as one ( Vol . IV . No. 13 ) to Governor Page of Virginia , another ( No. 144 ) to Mr. Adams , a third ( No. 185 ) to Thomas Jefferson Smith of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter at rest with all candid persons . But it is also a fact , that the last words ever traced by his hand , and which I have myself seen , were expressive of the hope and belief that he was going to rejoin the wife of his youth , whose loss he had never ceased to mourn , and a daughter whose untimely death had desolated his advancing age . " I know of no clergyman who visited Mr. Jefferson , except as any other friend might do , in his latter days . His intercourse with the clergy of the neighboring town of Charlottesville had always been friendly ; but besides that their views were widely different from his , they were not men calculated to exercise any influence over a mind like his . his sympathies were much stronger with the Unitarians than with any other of the religious denominations . He had known and esteemed Dr. Priestley . The prejudice against Unitarianism ( which most persons at the South confounded with Deism , if not Atheism ) // was , however , very strong , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the country where Mr. Jefferson resided . " Such , Sir , are the best answers I can make to the questiQns you have addressed to me . But after all , the true answer to the accusations of Mr. Jefferson 's enemies , and perhaps the more dangerous assertions of his pretended friends , is to be found in the whole tenor of a life passed in the exercise of every Christian virtue , and devoted to the service of his fellow-men . A distinction which he liked to draw between the lessons of Heathen philosophy and the teachings of Jesus was , that , by the first , men were taught to take care of their own happiness ; by the last , to think more of the happiness of others . And if all were not happy who came within the sphere of his influence , it was not for want of the most earnest desire and constant efforts on his part to make them so . In small things and in great the same wish to do good , and to give innocent pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning at home , extended themselves in circles to the utmost limit of his power . At home he had been the best husband , and was the best father and grandfather , the kindest master , the most fi3tithful and active friend , the most useful neighbor ! He was loved best where best known . Those who approached him nearest were the most devoted in their affection and veneration , and it was as men receded from him that they lost sight of the true proportions of his character , which became distorted to their eyes through the mists of prejudice and misconception . I repeat again my firm belief , that such a character as my dear grandfather 's could have been formed under no influences but those of the Gospel ; that there is in this world but one good tree capable of hearing such fruit . " I make no apology for such praise given to so near a relative . Mr. Jefferson has ceased to belong exclusively to his family , - he belongs to mankind , - and we of his blood should consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that knowledge of his true character which our near approach to him enabled us to become possessed of . His name is often heard , but how few there are who know how much of excellence that name implies . Whatever light , therefore , this letter can throw upon the truth , as it regards a great and good man , is yours , Sir , to make such use of as seems best to you . " With sentiments of great respect , I remain , &amp;c. "
