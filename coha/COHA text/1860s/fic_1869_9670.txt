Main text DIALOGUE I. AT THE DISTILLERY .  --  FIRST INTERVIEW . DISTILLER .  --  Good morning , Mr. Conscience ; though I know you to be one of the earliest risers , especially of late , I hardly expected to meet you here at day-dawn . CONSCIENCE .  --  I am none too early , it seems , to find you at your vocation . But how are you going to dispose of this great black building ? DISTILLER .  --  Why , I do not understand you . CONSCIENCE .  --  What are you doing with these boiling craters , and that hideous worm there ? DISTILLER .  --  Pray explain yourself . CONSCIENCE .  --  Whose grain is that ? and what is bread called in the Bible ? DISTILLER .  --  More enigmatical still . CONSCIENCE .  --  To what market do you mean to send that long row of casks ? and how many of them will it take upon an average to dig a drunkard 's grave ? DISTILLER .  --  Ah , I understand you now . I was hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perceive you have come upon the old errand . You intend to read me another lesson upon the sixth commandment . But what would you have me do ? CONSCIENCE .  --  Put out these fires . DISTILLER .  --  Nay , but hear me . I entered into this business with your approbation . The neighbours all encouraged me . My brethren in the church said it would open a fine market for their rye , and corn , and cider : and even my minister , happening to come along when we were raising , took a little with us under the shade , and said he loved to see his people industrious and enterprising . CONSCIENCE .  --  " The times of this ignorance God winked at  --  but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent . " In one part of your defence , at least , you are incorrect . It was not my voice , but my silence , if any thing , which gave consent ; and I have always suspected there was some foul play in the matter , and that I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , I distinctly recollect the morning bitters and evening toddy , which you were accustomed to give me ; and though I thought but little of it then , I now see that it deadened all my sensibilities . This , I am aware , is no excuse . I ought to have resisted  --  I ought to have refused , and to have paralyzed the hand which put the cup to my lips . And when you struck the first stroke on this ground , I ought to have warned you off with the voice of seven thunders . That I did not then speak out , and do my duty , will cause me extreme regret and self-reproach to the latest hour of my life . DISTILLER .  --  But what , my dear Conscience , has made you all at once so much wiser , not only than your former self , but than hundreds of enlightened men in every community , whose piety was never doubted ? I myself know , and have heard of not a few good Christians , including even deacons and elders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , or seem to think it right . CONSCIENCE .  --  And think it right ! Ask their conscience . I should like to witness some of those interviews which take place in the night , and which make Christian distillers  --  ( what a solecism ! )  --  so much more irritable than they used to be . I know one of the brotherhood , at least , whose conscience has been goading him these five years , and yet he perseveres . DISTILLER .  --  But if I stop , what will the people do ? Half the farmers in town depend upon their rye and cider to pay their taxes , and even to support the Gospel . CONSCIENCE .  --  So , then , you are pouring out these streams of liquid death over the land , and burning up your own neighbours , to enable them to pay their taxes and support religion ! Why do n't you set up a coffin factory , to create a brisker demand for lumber , and so help the farmers to pay their taxes ; and then spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faster , and thus increase your business , and give you a fair profit ? It will not do . I tell you , that I can give you no peace till you put out these fires and destroy that worm . DISTILLER .  --  How can I ? Here is all my living , especially since , as you know , my eldest son fell into bad habits , in spite of all the good advice I daily gave him , and squandered what might have afforded me a comfortable independence . CONSCIENCE .  --  Suppose you were now in Brazil , and the owner of a large establishment to fit out slave traders with handcuffs for the coast of Africa , and could not change your business without considerable pecuniary sacrifice ; would you make the sacrifice , or would you keep your fires and hammers still going ? DISTILLER .  --  Why do you ask such puzzling questions ? You know I do n't like them at all , especially when my mind is occupied with other subjects . Leave me , at least till I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nay , but hear me through . Is it right for you to go on manufacturing fevers , dropsy , consumption , delirium-tremens , and a host of other frightful diseases , because your property happens to be vested in a distillery ? Is it consistent with the great law of love by which you profess to be governed ? Will it bear examination in a dying hour ? Shall I bid you look back upon it from the brink of eternity , that you may from such recollections gather holy courage for your pending conflict with the king of terrors ? Will you bequeath this magazine of wrath and perdition to your only son not already ruined , and go out of the world rejoicing that you can leave the whole concern in the hands of one who is so trustworthy and so dear ? Here the Distiller leaves abruptly , without answering a word . SECOND INTERVIEW . DISTILLER .  --  ( Seeing Conscience approach , and beginning to tremble . ) What , so soon and so early at your post again ? I did hope for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distressed  --  I can not hold my peace . I am pained at my very heart . DISTILLER .  --  Do be composed , I beseech you , and hear what I have to say . Since our last interview I have resolved to sell out , and I expect the purchaser on in a very few days . CONSCIENCE .  --  What will he do with the establishment when he gets it ? DISTILLER .  --  You must ask him , and not me . But whatever he may do with it , I shall be clear . CONSCIENCE .  --  I wish I could be sure of that ; but let us see . Though you will not make poison by the hundred barrels any longer yourself , you will sell this laboratory of death to another man , for the same horrid purpose . You will not , with your own hands , go on forging daggers for maniacs to use upon themselves and their friends , provided you can get some one to take your business at a fair price . You will no longer drag the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can sell out the privilege to good advantage ! DISTILLER .  --  Was ever any man 's conscience so captious before ? You seem determined not to be satisfied with anything . But beware ; by pushing matters in this way you will produce a violent " reaction . " Even professors of religion will not bear it . For myself , I wish to treat you with all possible respect ; but forbearance itself must have its limits . CONSCIENCE .  --  Possibly you may be able to hold me in check a little longer ; but I am all the while gathering strength for an onset which you can not withstand ; and if you can not bear these kind remonstrances now , how will you grapple with " the worm that never dies ? " DISTILLER .  --  Enough , enough . I will obey your voice . But why so pale and deathlike ? CONSCIENCE .  --  O , I am sick , I am almost suffocated . These tartarean fumes , these dreadful forebodings , these heart-rending sights , and above all , my horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nearest neighbor , stealing across the lots , with his jug and half-bushel of rye . What is his errand , and where is his hungry shivering family ? And see there too , that tattered , half-starved boy , just entering the yard with a bottle  --  who sent him here at this early hour ? All these barrels  --  where are the wretched beings who are to consume this liquid fire , and to be consumed by it ? DISTILLER .  --  Spare me , spare me , I beseech you . By going on at this rate a little longer you will make me as nervous as yourself . CONSCIENCE .  --  But I can not close this interview till I have related one of the dreams to which I just alluded . It was only last night that I suffered in this way , more than tongue can tell . The whole terrific vision is written in letters of fire upon the tablet of my memory : and I feel it all the while burning deeper and deeper . I thought I stood by a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from what mountain or vast abyss it came , suddenly the field of my vision was extended to the distance of several hundred miles , and I perceived that , instead of springing from a single source , this rolling torrent of fire was fed by numerous tributary streams , and these again by smaller rivulets . And what do you think I heard and beheld , as I stood petrified with astonishment and horror ? There were hundreds of poor wretches struggling and just sinking in the merciless flood . As I contemplated the scene still more attentively , the confused noise of boisterous and profane merriment , mingled with loud shrieks of despair , saluted my ears . The hair of my head stood up  --  and looking this way and that way , I beheld crowds of men , women , and children , thronging down to the very margin of the river  --  some eagerly bowing down to slake their thirst with the consuming liquid , and others convulsively striving to hold them back . Some I saw actually pushing their neighbors headlong from the treacherous bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding up the fiery temptation to their view . To insure a sufficient depth of the river , so that destruction might be made doubly sure , I saw a great number of men , and some whom I knew to be members of the church , laboriously turning their respective contributions of the glowing and hissing liquid into the main channel . This was more than I could bear . I was in perfect torture . But when I expostulated with those who were nearest to the place where I stood , they coolly answered , This is the way in which we get our living . But what shocked me more than all the rest , and curdled every drop of blood in my veins , was the sight which I had of this very distillery pouring out its tributary stream of fire ! And O , it distracts , it maddens me to think of it . There you yourself stood feeding the torrent which had already swallowed up some of your own family , and threatened every moment to sweep you away ! This last circumstance brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the middle of the room ; and I awoke in an agony which I verily believe I could not have sustained for another moment . DISTILLER .  --  I will feed the torrent no longer . The fires of my distillery shall be put out . From this day , from this hour , I renounce the manufacture of ardent spirits for ever . DIALOGUE II . WHOLESALE DEALER 'S COUNTING-ROOM . CONSCIENCE .  --  ( Looking over the ledger with a serious air . ) What is that last invoice from the West Indies ? RUM-DEALER.  --  Only a few casks of fourth proof , for particular customers . CONSCIENCE .  --  And that domestic poison , via New Orleans ; and on the next page , that large consignment , via Erie Canal ? DEALER .  --  O , nothing but two small lots of prime whiskey , such as we have been selling these twenty years . But why these chiding inquiries ? They disquiet me exceedingly . And to tell you the plain truth , I am more than half offended at this morbid inquisitiveness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have often told you , that this is a bad business ; and the more I think of it , the more it troubles me . DEALER .  --  Why so ? You are always preaching up industry as a Christian virtue , and my word for it , were I to neglect my business , and saunter about the hotels and steamboat wharves , as some do , you would fall into convulsions , as if I had committed the unpardonable sin . CONSCIENCE .  --  Such pettish quibbling is utterly unworthy of your good sense and ordinary candor . You know , as well as I do , the great difference between industry in some safe and honest calling , and driving a business which carries poverty and ruin to thousands of families . DEALER .  --  Honest industry ! This is more cruel still . You have known me too long to throw out such insinuations ; and besides , it is notorious , that some of the first merchants in our city are engaged , far more extensively , in the same traffic . CONSCIENCE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they stand or fall . " But if fair dealing consists in " doing as we would be done by , " how can a man of your established mercantile and Christian reputation sustain himself , if he continues to deal in an article which he knows to be more destructive than all the plagues of Egypt ? DEALER .  --  Do you intend , then , to make me answerable for all the mischief that is done by ardent spirit , in the whole State and nation ? What I sell is a mere drop of the bucket , compared with the consumption of a single county . Where is the proof that the little which my respectable customers carry into the country , with their other groceries , ever does any harm ? How do you know that it helps to make such a frightful host of drunkards and vagabonds ? And if it did , whose fault would it be ? I never gave nor sold a glass of whiskey to a tippler in my life . Let those who will drink to excess , and make brutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , certainly they must answer for it ; but will that excuse those who furnish the poison ? Did you never hear of abettors and accessories , as well as principals in crime ? When Judas , in all the agony of remorse and despair , threw down the thirty pieces of silver before the chief priests and elders , exclaiming , I have sinned , in that I have betrayed the innocent blood  --  they coolly answered , What is that to us ? See thou to that . And was it therefore nothing to them ? Had they no hand in that cruel tragedy ? Was it nothing to Pilate  --  nothing to Herod  --  nothing to the multitude who were consenting to the crucifixion of the Son of God  --  because they did not drive the nails and thrust the spear ? O , when I think of what you are doing to destroy the bodies and souls of men , I can not rest . It terrifies me at all hours of the night . Often and often , when I am just losing myself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unearthly imprecations , coming out of these hogsheads . And then , those long processions of rough-made coffins and beggared families , which I dream of , from nightfall till daybreak , they keep me all the while in a cold sweat , and I can no longer endure them . DEALER .  --  Neither can I. Something must be done , You have been out of your head more than half the time for this six months . I have tried all the ordinary remedies upon you without the least effect . Indeed , every new remedy seems only to aggravate the disease . O , what would not I give for the discovery of some anodyne which would lay these horrible phantasms . The case would be infinitely less trying , if I could sometimes persuade you , for a night or two , to let me occupy a different appartment from yourself for when your spasms come on , one might as well try to sleep with , embers in his bosom , as where you are . CONSCIENCE .  --  Would it mend the matter at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be always wide awake ? DEALER .  --  Ah , there 's the grand difficulty . For I find that when you do wake up , you are more troublesome than ever . Then you are always harping upon my being a professor of religion , and bringing up some text of Scripture , which might as well be let alone , and which you would not ring in my ears , if you had any regard to my peace , or even your own . More than fifty times , within a month , have you quoted , " By their fruits ye shall know them . " In fact , so uncharitable have you grown of late that from the drift of some of your admonitions , a stranger would think me but little , if any , better than a murderer . And all because some vagabond or other may possibly happen to shorten his days by drinking a little of the identical spirit which passes through my hands . CONSCIENCE .  --  You do me bare justice when you say that I have often reproved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly did . But my remonstrances have always been between you and me alone . If I have charged you with the guilt of hurrying men to the grave and to hell by this vile traffic , it has not been upon the house-top . I can not , it is true , help knowing how it grieves your brethren , gratifies the enemies of religion and excites the scorn of drunkards themselves , to see your wharf covered with the fiery element ; but I speak only in your own ears . To yourself I have wished to prove a faithful monitor , though I have sad misgivings , at times , even with regard to that . You will bear me witness , however , that I have sometimes trembled exceedingly , for fear that I should be compelled , at last , to carry the matter up by indictment to the tribunal of eternal Justice . To avoid this dreadful necessity , let me once more reason the case with you in a few words . You know perfectly well , that ardent spirit kills its tens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more room to doubt that many of these lives are destroyed by the very liquor which you sell , then if you saw them staggering under it into the drunkards ' grave . How then can you possibly throw off bloodguiltiness , with the light which you now enjoy ? In faithfulness to your soul , and to Him whose viceregent I am , I can not say less , especially if you persist any longer in the horrible traffic . DEALER .  --  Pardon me , my dear Conscience , if , under the excitement of the moment , I complained of your honest and continued importunity . Be assured , there is no friend in the world with whom I am so desirous of maintaining a good understanding as with yourself . And for your relief and satisfaction , I now give you my solemn pledge , that I will close up this branch of my business as soon as possible . Indeed , I have commenced the process already . My last consignments are less , by more than one half , than were those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year comes about , my books shall speak still more decidedly in my favor . CONSCIENCE .  --  These resolutions would be perfectly satisfactory , if they were in the present tense . But if it was wrong to sell five hundred casks last year , how can it be right to sell two hundred this year , and one hundred next ? If it is criminal to poison forty men at one time , how can it be innocent to poison twenty at another ? If you may not throw a hundred firebrands into the city , how will you prove that you may throw one ? DEALER .  --  Very true , very true  --  but let us waive this point for the present . It affects me very strangely . CONSCIENCE .  --  How long , then , will it take to dry up this fountain of death ? DEALER .  --  Do n't call it so , I beseech you ; but I intend to be entirely out of the business in two or three years , at farthest . CONSCIENCE .  --  Two or three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed between us , persist two or three years longer in a contraband traffic ? I verily thought , that when we had that long conference two or three months ago , you resolved to close the concern at once ; and that when we parted , I had as good as your promise , that you would . Surely , you can not so soon have forgotten it . DEALER .  --  No , I remember that interview but too well ; for I was never so unhappy in my life . I did almost resolve , and more than half promise , as you say . But after I had time to get a little composed , I thought you had pushed matters rather too far ; and that I could convince you of it , at a proper time . I see , however , that the attempt would be fruitless . But as I am anxious for a compromise , let me ask whether , if I give away all the profits of this branch of my business to the Bible Society , and other institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be satisfied ? CONSCIENCE .  --  Let me see . Five hundred dollars , or one hundred dollars , earned to promote the cause of religion by selling poison ! By killing husbands , and fathers , and brothers , and torturing poor women and children ! It smells of blood  --  and can God possibly accept of such an offering ? DEALER .  --  So then , it seems , I must stop the sale at once , or entirely forfeit what little charity you have left . CONSCIENCE .  --  You must . Delay is death  --  death to the consumer at least ; and how can you flatter yourself that it will not prove your own eternal death ? My convictions are decisive , and be assured , I deal thus plainly because I love you , and can not bear to become your everlasting tormentor . DIALOGUE III . AT THE RETAILER 'S STAND . CONSCIENCE .  --  Do you know that little half-starved , bare-footed child , that you just sent home with two quarts of rank poison ? ( Retailer hums a tune to himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CONSCIENCE .  --  I see by the paper of this morning , that the furniture of Mr. M  --  is to be sold under the hammer to-morrow . Have I not often seen him in your taproom ? RETAILER .  --  I am extremely busy just now , in bringing up my ledger . CONSCIENCE .  --  Have you heard how N  --  abused his family , and turned them all into the street the other night , after being supplied by you with whiskey ? RETAILER .  --  He is a brute , and ought to be confined in a dungeon six months at least , upon bread and water . CONSCIENCE .  --  Was not S  --  , who hung himself lately , one of your steady customers ? and where do you think his soul is now fixed for eternity ? You sold him rum that evening , not ten minutes before you went to the prayer-meeting , and had his money in your pocket  --  for you would not trust him  --  when you led in the exercises . I heard you ask him once , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Sabbath-school ; and I shall never forget his answer . " Come , you talk like a minister ; but , after all , we are about of one mind  --  at least in some things . Let me have my jug and be going . " RETAILER .  --  I know he was an impudent , hardened wretch ; and though his death was extremely shocking , I am glad to be rid of him . CONSCIENCE .  --  Are you ready to meet him at the bar of God , and to say to the Judge . " He was my neighbor  --  I saw him going down the broad way , and I did every thing that a Christian could do to save him ? " RETAILER .  --  ( Aside . O that I could stifle the upbraidings of this cruel monitor . ) You keep me in constant torment . This everlasting cant about rank poison , and liquid fire , and blood , and murder , is too much far even a Christian to put up with . Why , if any body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be indictable as a foul slanderer , before a court of justice . CONSCIENCE .  --  Is it slander , or is it because I tell you the truth , that your temper is so deeply ruffled under my remonstrances ? Suppose I were to hold my peace , while your hands are becoming more and more deeply crimsoned with this bloody traffic . What would you say to me , when you come to meet that poor boy who just went out , and his drunken father , and broken-hearted mother , at the bar of God ? Would you thank your conscience for having let you alone while there was space left for repenttance ? RETAILER .  --  Ah , had honest trader ever such a conscience to deal with before ? Always just so uncompromising  --  always talking about the " golden rule "  --  always insisting upon a moral standard which nobody can live up to  --  always scenting poverty , murder , and suicide , in every glass of whiskey , though it were a mile off . The truth is , you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Acting in conformity with your more than puritanical rules , would starve any man and his family to death . CONSCIENCE .  --  Well , here comes another customer  --  see the carbuncles ! Will you fill his bottle with wrath , to be poured out without mixture , by and by , upon your own head ? Do you not know that his pious wife is extremely ill , and suffering for want of every comfort , in their miserable cabin ? RETAILER .  --  No , Mr. E  --  , go home and take care of your family . I am determined to harbor no more drunkards here . CONSCIENCE .  --  You mean to make a distinction then , do you , between harboring those who are already ruined , and helping to destroy such as are now respectable members of society . You will not hereafter tolerate a single drunkard on your premises ; but  --  RETAILER .  --  Ah , I see what you are aiming at ; and really it is too much for any honest man , and still more for any Christian to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have pretended to answer half your captious questions . There 's no use in it . It only leads onto others still more impertinent and puzzling . If I am the hundredth part of that factor of Satan which you would make me , I ought to be dealt with , and cast out of the church at once ; and why do n't my good brethren see to it ? CONSCIENCE .  --  That 's a hard question , which they , perhaps , better know how to answer than I do . RETAILER .  --  But have you forgotten , my good Conscience , that in retailing spirit , I am under the immediate eye and sanction of the laws . Mine is no contraband traffic , as you very well know . I hold a license from the rulers and fathers of the state , and have paid my money for it into the public treasury . Why do they continue to grant and sell licenses , if it is wrong for me to sell rum ? CONSCIENCE .  --  Another hard question , which I leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , however , that public bodies have no soul , and if they have no soul , it is difficult to see how they can have any conscience ; and if not , what should hinder them from selling licenses ? but suppose the civil authorities should offer to sell you a license to keep a gambling-house , or a brothel , would you purchase such a license , and present it as a salve to your conscience ? RETAILER .  --  I tell you once more , there is no use in trying to answer your questions ; for say what I will , you have the art of turning everything against me . It was not always so , as you must very distinctly remember . Formerly I could retail hogshead after hogshead of all kinds of spirits , and you slept as quietly as a child . But since you began to read these Reports and Tracts about drinking , and to attend Temperance meetings , I have scarcely had an hour 's peace of my life . I feared that something like this would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you may recollect that I strongly objected to your troubling yourself with these new speculations . It now grieves me to think that I ever yielded to your importunity ; and beware that you do not push me to extremities in this matter , for I have about come to the resolution that I will have no more of these mischievous pamphlets , either about my store or tavern ; and that your temperance agents may declaim to to the winds and walls , if they please . CONSCIENCE .  --  I am amazed at your blindness and obstinacy . It is now from three to five years since I began to speak  --  though in a kind of indistinct undertone at first  --  against this bloody traffic . I have reasoned , I have remonstrated , and latterly I have threatened and implored with increasing earnestness . At times you have listened , and been convinced that the course which you are pursuing , in this day of light , is infamous , and utterly inconsistent with a Christian profession ; but before your convictions and resolutions have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its ascendency ; and thus have you gone on resolving , and relapsing , and re-resolving  --  one hour at the preparatory lecture , and the next unloading whiskey at your door ; one moment mourning over the prevalence of intemprance , and the next arranging your decanters to entice the simple ; one day partaking of the cup of the Lord at his table , and the next offering the cup of devils to your neighbors ; one day singing , " All that I have , and all I am , I consecrate to Thee , " and the next , for the sake of a little gain , sacrificing your character , and polluting all you can induce to drink ! O , how can I hold my peace ? How can I let you alone ? If you will persist , your blood , and the blood of those whom you thus entice and destroy , be upon your own head . Whether you will hear , or whether you will forbear , I shall not cease to remonstrate ; and when I can do no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gate , in the bitterness of despair , and cry , Murder ! MURDER ! ! MURDER ! ! ! RETAILER .  --  ( Pale and trembling . ) " Go thy way for this time ; when I have a convenient season , I will call for thee . "
