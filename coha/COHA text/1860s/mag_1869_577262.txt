txt THOMAS CARLYLE AS A PRACTICAL GUIDE . MR . CATILYLE says , in his last essay , of the intellect of a man who believes in a political method in which he does not himself believe , that " it is to him a finished-off and shut-up intellect , with which he will not argue . " This , we take it , is precisely the condition of his own intellect ; he , as a thinker , is " finished off and shut up , " incapable , henceforth , of self-criticism or self-modification , of recognizing any facts adverse to his theories , even of common intellectual self-restraint . There is nothing more to come from him in the way of philosophy , but repetition or exaggeration of what we have had before . The time , therefore , has arrived for believers in him , whose number is probably not great , and for those who have been influenced by him , and whose number is very great , to consider what he is really worth as an ethical , social , and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , we will venture to say that we do not yield to the most devoted of his disciples . As a historical painter , we hold him to be for vividness without a peer ; we should not even except Tacitus . Literature , we conceive , can show no series of historical pictures comparable for sustained excellence and interest , to his " History of the French Revolution , " decidedly the greatest of his works ; though some of the minor pieces , historical and biographical , such as the " Diamond Necklace , " and some of the narrative passages in the " Cromwell , " are its rivals in merit on a smaller scale . Alone , or nearly alone among historians , he brings out the comic as well as the tragic element of the historic drama ; and thus completes the ethical truth which is left incomplete in other writers . His historical sympathies are large , and from partisanship he is generally clear . The main faults of his histories are the consequences of his false theory of hero-worship , which , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a critical estimate of Mirabean and Danton , or of anybody with whom , or any thing with which , they were concerned ; and turns his " Frederic the Great , " in spite of some excellent descriptions both of events and men , into a wild extravaganza , which those who know the sober truth can hardly read with patience . A philosophic historian he can scarcely be called , because no true or even intelligible philosophy of history or of life underlies the mystical language which in him supplies the place of historical reflection , and which conveys to the minds of shallow readers an impression of extraordinary depth Nntered , in the year 0869. by 0 . P. PUTNAM &amp; SON , in the Clerk ' . 019cr of the District Court of the U. S. for the Southern District of N. Y. // and insight . The philosophy of his " French Revolution , " if it has any , is fatalistic . French institutions , religious and political , had , in course of time , decayed , and therefore they fell in ; ihat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the one question supremely interesting to Historical Philosophy , " Why did this great attempt to bring about a Brotherhood of Man fail and end in Bonapartism ? " he neither gives nor attempts to give any answer . A French statesman , who is at the same time one of the first literary men in France , and who is , moreover , perfectly at home in the English language , was asked whether he had read Carlyle 's " French Revolution . " " I tried to read it , " was the reply- " to read it was impossible . He is a bad Michelet , a compound of petty accuracies with great inaccuracies . " We are far from agreeing with the criticism , but we can understand it . The critic was probably satiated with pictures of the Revolution : he hoped to find in Carlyle philosophy , and he found none . As a biographer , Mr. Carlyle has produced two classes of works , the rational and the hero-worshiping . In the rational biographies , those of Biderot and Voltaire , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above every disturbing passion , and gives us the true lineaments of his subject in language the impression of which can never be effaced . In the hero-worshiping biographies you get the results of an industrious research into the facts ; you get living pictures ; you get language full of force and point ; you get a strong statement of the case in favor of the hero ; but no reader who retains any control over his own imagination , or any power of judgment , can believe for a moment that he gets the truth . That Cromwell was a great man , is a fact which Mr. Carlyle 's life of him has done a good deal to establish . That he was the divinity which Mr. Carlyle makes him out to have been ; that his immoral acts , such as the Irish massacres and the execution of Charles I. , were really instances of a morality of the " lightnings " above that of ordinary men ; that the darkness of his incoherent and probably very ill-reported speeches is really an excess of light , scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inspiration and the Pythian frenzy is out of him , can believe . We have spoken of the " Frederic the Great " as a history ; perhaps we should rather rank it among the hero-worshipping biographies . And regarded as a hero-worshiping biography , it consummates as well as concludes the series . It shows to what lengths of extravagance a man of genius may be carried , if he once loses his intellectual self-control . Its moral judgments are about as worthy of attention as the moral judgments of a young lady in the case of her accepted lover ; and the language is about as much within the bounds of reason in the one case as in the other . Say at once that Frederic is " My Angel ; " that every one who presumes to come in his way or to say any thing against him , ought to have his eyes scratched out ; and we are spared a good deal of rather monotonous and wearisome rhodomontade ; a good deal of very pettifogging sophistry ( as in the question of Silesia ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and the laws of honor . Perhaps the wildest part of all is the attempt to canonize the father of Frederic , of whose character his contemporaries framed , upon abundant evidence , a perfectly correct estimate , and who may be said to have combined the qualities of a Quilp with those of a Caliban . " What could equal the avarice , malice and rabid snappishness of old Frederic William the father ? " So said Mr. Carlyle in his essay on Voltaire , before he had taken in hand Frederic William 's son as a hero . So said the world in Frederic William 's day , and so says the world now of a king who behaved to his family like a drunken cobbler , and who , in a mingled fit of brutal fury and cruel pedantry , not only put his son 's bosom friend to death for what nobody but a madman could have deemed a capital offence , but forced his // son to witness the execution . " To judge of an original man , " says Mr. Carlyle , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A very grand principle , if only you were yourself not one of the world . To do Mr. Carlyle justice , however , he never , so far as we are aware , even in his finest frenzy , misstates or suppresses facts , however adverse to the character of his hero ; he only bludgeons them and you with his Eternal Yerities , and " Moralities of the Gods . " In this he is superior to his parodists , and notably to Mr. Froude , whose moral eccentricities are visible to all his readers , but the depths of whose dealings with facts are known to few . As a humorist and sentimentalist Mr. Carlyle has obviously borrowed a good deal from the Germans ; but we believe it will be generally admitted that he has paid his debt . Both " Sartor Resartus " and " Past and Present " have in them a great deal of mere transcendental verbiage , such as inflates without feeding ; but they also contain both *atire and pathos , each excellent in its kind . We need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Present , " in which the implied reasoning is that as Abbot Samson and other heroes of the Middle Ages struggled hard with roguery and mendacity all their lives , there must have been comparatively little roguery and mendacity in those days ; a satirist , pointing his attacks upon the present by a contrast drawn from the past , is not to be supposed literally to prefer the time of King John to ours . Mr. Carlyle 's style is artificial , and adopted originally for the sake of effect , as a comparison of his earliest with his later writings will show ; and whatever is artificial and adopted for the sake of effect , is to that extent weak , But it has become a second nature to him , and in him we can tolerate it ; it is the imitation of it by the Carlylunculi that is so intolerable . In his case , besides impressing and amusing us , it incidentally serves the ends of truth ; since it warns the reader continually that the writer is a cynic and a humorist , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , however , not with Mr. Carlyle 's historical painting , nor with his satire , but with his practical philosophy alone that we deal here ; and this in a very limited way . To do him justice , we must go back to the period at which he first came out as a prophet . It was the period of that incipient democratic movement in England , which followed the long suspension of all progress by the great French war , and which brought about the Reform Bill of 1832 , the overthrow of fiscal protection , the abolition of slavery , and the mitigation of the Criminal Code . No doubt in those days men 's hopes of political regeneration through legislation were too high ; they did expect too much from the suffrage and the ballot box , and rely too much on the general enlightenment and virtue of the uneducated and bribable masses of the people . No doubt political economy did take too much upon itself , and assume that it was capable of doing a good deal more than any science which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the elevation of mankind . Benthamism and the Gospel of enlightened self-interest did ride a good deal too high ; the paramount importance of the moral element in human affairs , and the part necessarily played in history by strong and noble characters was too much left out of sight by political theorists . On the other hand , Philanthropy , in its natural reaction against the brutalities of West Indian slavery and the old criminal law , did run into extremes ; it did ignore the evil which is in man and the stem repression which its presence sometimes demands ; it was sometimes tainted with cant and hypocrisy ; it not unfrequently played the fooL Correctives of these tendencies , therefore , philosophical or satirical , grave or gay , were in season . A man of really philosophic mind and of genuine insight would have applied them and stopped there . He would have rebuked the extravagant pretensions and tempered the overweening hopes of Demoe* racy , without plunging headlong into the advocacy of despotism ; he would // have shown political economy its limits , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dismal Science . He would have laughed at any maudlin sentiment which there might be about the negro without defending slavery , and combatted ultra-philanthropy in the Prison System without sneering at the memory of Howard . But Mr. Carlyle , with all his literary gifts , is not a man of really philosophic mind nor of genuine insight . He is a man of vivid impressions and keen emotions , but he is not , properly speaking , a thinker at all . His eye is for the outward , whether the tragic or the grotesque . He knows not what it is to test and reconsider his own theories , to ascertain their practicability , to fix their limits ; in a word , thoroughly and deliberately to seek the truth . Where a stroncrer man would have rationally criticised the prevailing tendencies and founded every thing he had to say , in whatever form , upon the result of that criticism , Mr. Carlyle abandoned himself to his antipathy , and of that antipathy he has made a philosophy of history and life . His philosophy is hero-worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at once that the character of his heroic ruler is very limited and one-sided ; that it is , iu fact , the mere embodim*nt of the transient antagonisms and aversions of the theorist . It is always anti-democratic , anti-economical , and anti-philanthropic ; its notes are force displayed in war or arbitrary government  --  a contempt for political economy and every thing akin to it  --  a readiness to shed blood . Pericles , Marcus Aurelius , Alfred , St. Louis , are not Mr. Carlyle 's kings ; his kings are Cromwell , Napoleon , Dr. Francia , Frederic the Great . If he could find a ruler who had established slavery , that ruler would probably become , in his eyes , the foremost man in history . He attempts , it is true , to connect other kinds of greatness  --  the greatness of the poet , the religious reformer and the moralist , with that of dominant force ; but he does thi* in effect by assuming that all the other kinds of greatnessthat of Shakespeare , Burns , Rousseau ( and why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force ; and that Rousseau , for example , on a throne would have been a Napoleon or a Francia . He " has no notion of a truly great man who could not be all sorts of men . " The ethical part of Carlylism corresponds with its political and social part . Force is the ethical ideal of all the disciples of the school ; violence , bluster , disregard , of mercy and justice  --  the faults into which they almost invariably run . We do not purpose here to dwell at any length on hero-worship as a theory . To state the doctrine in plain terms is at once to expose its unsoundness . It is not true that any man , however richly endowed , is " a natural luminary , shining by the gift of Heaven ; ' * the light of all men , though varying in degree , is the same in kind and comes from the same source . It is not true that blind trust in any man 's words would be the highest wisdom and the salvation of his fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History is not a mere aggregate of the biographies of great men ; it is the result of the general effort of Humanity , of which great men are only the highest and most conspicuous organs . The great man draws most of his greatness , not from himself but from his kind . Shakespeare , says Mr. Carlyle , had to write for the Globe Play House , otherwise he would have been infinitely greater than he was . The Globe Play house was , on the contrary , the source of a great part of Shakespeare 's inspiration . King does not mean , as Mr. Carlyle is always saying , canning or able man ; it probably means child of the people : Mr. Carlyle 's error in etymology is typical of his error in philosophy . Never having studied history comprehensively , he fails to see that the importance of individual leaders and rulers is greatest in primitive times , and decreases as civilization advances , as the general level of humanity rises , as intelligence becomes more diffused , as general ideas , principles , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Charlemagne // or an Alfred stands so much above the masses in a dark and degraded age , as aimost to appear to belong to a superior order of beings . In the anarchy , too , of primeval society , arbitrary rule is , or at least may be , a principle of civilization and order ; it is a principle of barbarism and disorder in times like ours . The only principle of order in our time is law , which rests , not upon bliad obedience , but upon intelligent allegiance , and the formation and improvement of which are due to the intellect and virtue of the whole community , not to a personal revelation . Reverence for great men is good and ennobling , both to him who reveres and to him who is revered ; worship would degrade both . If heroes were immortals , worship would suit their nature ; as they are mortals it would be their degradation and their moral death ; we should destroy the deity by the incense which we offered to it . Cromwell was not worshiped ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , and to undergo to the end of his days the stern discipline of opposition . Otherwise he would not have been a Cromwell ; but a Sultan or a Llama . Then we have to ask , and we shall ask in vain , how Mr. Carlyle expects his theory to be practically applied . If we are all fools , and such fools that to reverse our judgment on any great man is the way to arrive at a true estimate of him , how can we discern the hero when he appears ? Is society to throw itself into convulsions , like those which produced Cromwell or Napoleon , in order that the latent force of the hero may be made manifest l Or are there any signs by which , as Buddhists recognize their Llama , we are to recognize the captain of our political salvation ? Once more the theory is false , and out of falsehood no truth or practical good can come . In the experimental sciences , people now see that a hypothesis contradicted by facts is worthless . In moral and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a consciousness of this truth ; they think it rational to admire and even to follow teachers , the soundness of whose teaching they are not prepared to maintain . In course of time this state of things will be changed ; truth will be exacted as rigorously in morals and politics as it is in physical science ; the reign of the moral and political prophet will then come to an end , and that of the rational investigator will begin , without , as we conceive , the slightest detriment to the functions of the poet , the humorist , the sentimentalist , or the picturesque historian . Our special object at present is simply to point out that Carlylism , as a theory of politics and ethics , has been of late practically applied by its author himself to contemporary events and characters in three notable cases . ( 1 . ) The first case is one pretty fresh in the memory of Americans , and on which many words need not be expended . In the midst of the civil war , at a time when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great depression , and when almost all foreigners who were not very strongly sustained by moral faith in the triumph of right despaired of the restoration of the Union , Mr. Carlyle published in Afaemillan 's Afa*acine , under the title of " The American Iliad in a Nutshell , " his judgment on the great conflict . The form of his utterance was in the highest degree Delphic and prophetic ; indeed , if it had been the utterance of any one but a prophet , its arrogance would have verged upon insanity . The whole amount of the matter , according to the Seer , was a crazy determination on the part of the North to force the South to hire servants by the week instead of hiring them for life ; the end he evidently expected would be the utter confusion of the North . So far and no further this inspired man saw into the sources and the probable issue of the great events which were passing under his eyes . Such was the light which his philosophy afforded to the world in a critical hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed himself but to slavery generally . Slavery , as opposed to what - he calls the " Nomadic " service of free // contract , is his panacea for the evils of the industrial world . Ta his " Latter Day Pamphlets " he propounded it expressly for a White Ireland as well as a Black Jamaica . " Paddy " and " Quashee " were alike to be organized into labor regiments , placed under taskmasters of heroic temperament , and hanged and shot if they did not work . This was propounded by him to statesmen dealing with the Irish difficulty , as seriously as any thing can be propounded by a cynic ; if he did not mean it as practical advice , there is nothing practical in his writings . And the man to whom he looked for its execution was Sir Robert Peel ; a singular instance of his insight into character : for Sir Robert Peel , besides being of all men the most scrupulously just and humane , was , of all great statesmen , the one most bound by constitutional forms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the most inclined to the " rosewater " method of dealing with such questions . His remedies for Ireland were the establishment of religious liberty and the improvement of popular education . Mr. Carlyle will soon , on this question , be alone sane in a world of madmen . Not only has free labor proved itself superior in the American struggle to slavery by that test of force which , according to Mr. Carlyle , is the ultimate test of goodness , but it has gained a complete moral victory ; for though Americans may still be divided by other questions connected with or issuing out of the civil war , their acquiescence in the abolition of slavery is general and fast becoming universal . Russia Mr. Carlyle 's own Russia , in the meantime , has emancipated her serfs , and the emancipation of the slaves has been decreed in Cuba . Not only the moral sense of the whole world , but all the facts will soon be on the same side . That the relations between employer and employed will , by gradual effort in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and perhaps less nomadic than they are , is , we hope , within the range of possibility . Slavery , vanquished on the most terrible and decisive of battlefields , seems to be repudiated by the heart and experience of man forever . In Shooting Niagara , the Seer , evidently displeased at the mistakes made by Destiny , and the unavoidable postponement of his own implied prophecy , gives us some moody paragraphs about the probable extinction of the negro race in America , the dreadful carnage of the civil war , and the decay of the fortifications of Dominica under the rule of a free negro government , with liberty of self-taxation . The probable extinction of the negro race is a question about which he speaks , we will venture to say , pretty much at hap-hazard , and into which we are not concerned to follow him . Carnage is very dreadful , and war is " a deluge from the Pit of Hell , " in his eyes , as in those of other moralists of the despotic or aristocratic school , when the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republican institutions ; but not a word of pity is wasted on the " half million of men or more " who were slit into deaths quite as horrible or more so ( the humanities of war being far less observed , and the wounded treated with incomparably less care ) , to decide whether this or the other crowned filibuster-Frederic the Great , or his Austrian competitor - should be called sovereign of Silesia and receive the taxes of that province . As to the dilapidated fortifications of IDominica , we must candidly confess that our attention has not been turned to them , and that we are not prepared to maintain that the " nigger " assembly of the island has exercised a judicious economy in allowing , as Mr. Carlyle complains that it has , an old battery to go out of repair ; we can only say that if the niggers were in no *mm1-nent danger of war , the decay of a school or a hospital would seem to us a more palpable instance of misgovernment . Mr. Carlyle proposes to set right all that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barataria to " some younger son of a duke or of an earl , or of the Queen herself , doomed now to go mainly to the devil for want of a // career ; " but ; who , in hiS Barataria , with unlimited power and unlimited command of all its agreeable products and luxurious appliances would no doubt at once show forth his hereditary wisdom and virtue , and become an heroic ruler of men ; such being the usual course of things when young noblemen are called as members of the house of Lords to the work of hereditary government at home . Of course , slavery would at once be established , with all the flogging and shooting in which a certain kind of weakness , affecting the appearance of strength , delights so much in its paper reveries to indulge . We have only to remind the proposer of this plan for regenerating IDominica , that slavery not very long ago existed in the West India Islands ; that a full inquiry was made into its working , not only by " nigger philanthropists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ultra-commercial nation ; and that the result of the inquiry was a deliberate and pretty unanimous conviction of the British people that if they did not speedily forsake slavery , God would forsake them . ( 2 . ) In the case of the disturbances in Jamaica , or , as some called it , the Jamaica Massacre , Mr. Carlyle fairly came out of literary into political life , and from his action and that of his leading disciples , Mr. Kingsley and Mr. Ruskin , in that matter , we know that the Hero , whose essence it is so difficult to define , is incarnate in at least one living man , that man being Ex-Governor Eyre . The Apis of Carlylism is found . The facts of this case are very well ascertained , and they may fortunately be taken by themselves without diverging into the everlasting question as to the political capabilities of the negro . Governor Eyre , at all events , went out commissioned and bound by his general duty as a ruler to do justice to all the subjects of the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect the weaker race . Upon his installation as Governor , he made a tour of inspection through the islands , and reported the people not only loyal but affectionately attached to the Government . Here , therefore , it would seem , there was no Herculean task of governii*g . But his successor , Sir J. P. Grant , states that at the time of his own arrival on the island , the judiciary was in such hands that there was practically no justice for the poor , and that there was nothing worthy of the name of a police . There was , moreover , a total neglect of popular education , though a large sum was raised annually for the clergy of a State church , which was a mere appanage of the dominant race , and the bishop of which was permanently a resident of England , and leaving his duties to a coadjutor , though he could come forward to express his Christian approval of the massacre of his neglected flock . Such is an heroic reign of justice ! A sanguinary collision , having its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir J. P. Grant , took place between the magistrates and the people at the Court House in the parish of St. Thomas . About twenty persons were killed on each side ; those who fell on the side of the magistrates being , as it happened , mostly colored volunteers . Thirty-four of those who were in the Court House when it was stormed by the peasantry escaped with their lives . A wave of riot then spread over St. Thoumas , and one other parish . One more white man , and one only , was killed . No white woman was hurt or outraged in any way whatever ; all the statements of that kind were proved to be false , as was Governor Eyre 's report , that the mob had horribly mutilated the bodies of those slain at time Court House . The riot was merely local and accidental ; nor did any disturbance , however slight , take place , except in the corner of the island where it occurred . The figment of a general conspiracy of the blacks throughout the island to slaughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Eyre afterwards got up to justify his own atrocities , was never substantiated by a particle of evidence , and // was pronounced by the Royal Commissioners of Inquiry to be unfounded . The Governor himself ; when he first heard of the outbreak , instead of acting like one who knew that he was " on the edge of a volcano , " quietly went off to his country home to receive a party at dinner . To suppress the riot he had at hand , or within call , thirteen sllips of war , with crews amounting in the aggregate to one thousand six hundred and ninety-six men , and twelve hundred regular infantry , besides militia , volunteers , pensioners , marines , mounted police , royal artillery , and maroons . We have it under the Governor 's own hand , that no stand was anywhere made by the rioters ; that a party of thirty-five men marched unresisted through the heart of the disturbed district , and that not a single casualty befell any one of the soldiers or sailors engaged . It was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 17th of . October , and on the 20th the Governor was able officially to report that " the rebellion was crushed , " and that all the principal persons concerned had been killed or captured . Here again , therefore , the task was not Herculean ; there was nothing to upset the moral equilibrium of a Hero . Nevertheless fortwenty-flve days more , whether in wretched panic or from sheer cruelty , matters little for the present purpose , Governor Eyre allowed the fury of the dominant race to revel in butchery and havoc . On the very day ( October 20 ) when , according to his own account , tranquility was completely restored , fifty-one men and a woman were put to death . Altogether , four hundred and thirty-nine men and women were slaughtered , three hundred and twentysix of them after the disturbance . The number of both sexes flogged ( for women were flogged as well as men ) was not less than six hundred . The floggings were administered in some cases with whips twined with wire . Official persons reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one colonel boasted in his report that he had outdone his compeers by making his pris oners hang each other . A peasant was put up at four hundred yards as a target for riflemen . Upwards of a thousand houses were burnt down ; and this wanton havoc marks perhaps even more distinctly than the wholesale executions , the complete ascendency of vindictive passion over justice . Governor Eyre was fully cognizant of ; and responsible for all these surroundings . He received constant reports of what was going on . He was present when twenty-seven persons were hanged at once . He may be said almost to have hanged with his own hand . " His Excellency and suite returned on board , after hanging a rebel to a tree near the pier . " His Excellency was a careless hangman , for the poor wretch got his feet upon the ground , and after having been twice shot by Lieutenant Brand , one of the court martial ' judges , was at length put out of his agony by a marine . The Ron . George William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the legislature of the Island . To use the graphic expression of a subordinate official , he had been " a thorn in the side of the- Government for many years . " He had brought charges against Mr. Eyrc not only of mal-administration , but of corruption . The two men were not only political antagonists , but deadly personal enemies ; and Eyre speaks of Gordon even when dead in terms of the most rancorous personal hatred . At the time of the disturbance , Gordon was not in the district where martial law had been proclaimed , but at Kingston , under the protection of the common law . here Eyre arrested him , to all intents and purposes , with his own hand ; carried him , in spite of the remonstrance of a member of the Council , who divined the Governor 's murderous intent , on board his own ship ; conveyed him into the proclaim9d district , and there put him into the hands of a court martial consisting of Lieutenant Brand and two other men of the same stamp , who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counsel ; a letter of advice sent him by a legal friend // was withheld ; the time required to call a decisive witness in his defence , who was close at hand , was not allowed him . He was convicted of treason after a trial which the Chief Justice of England has declared to have been conducted in a manner utterly inconsistent not only with the technical rules of judicial procedure , but with common fair play , and upon evidence which the same authority pronounces not only " legally inadmissible , " but " morally worthless . " In fact , nothing could be more unlikely than that he , whose character was the very reverse of military , would have been a party to an appeal to force , hopeless in itself , and which could end only in his own political ruin . The local corninander , Colonel Nelson , though steeped *n innocent blood , shrank from the consummation of this crime , and found a pretext for shifting the responsibility from himself by specially referring the report of the court martial to Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed the execution of the sentence ; and Ge rdon was hanged accordingly , the comfort of a clergyman being deaied him in his dying hour . His house was sacked by the soldiery , his overseer was put to death , his widow was left destitute . It is alleged that Eyre was not actuated by personal enmity , but that he was the organ of the general hatred and suspicion felt against Gordon by the dominant race . That would not much mend the matter when we are talking of heroic rulers . But the fact of the personal enmity must have been present to his mind . Had there been a particle of chivalry or nobleness in his soul , it would have acted as a check , constraining him scrupulously to observe every form of justice in the case of his enemy . On his return to England , Mr. Eyre went down to Shropshire , where he was under the jurisdiction of a county magistracy of tory squires , who , of course , refused to commit him for trial . He had not killed an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred peasants . A professional magistrate , in whose ju risdiction he was afterwards found , committed him for trial ; but the Grand Jury of London , an organ of plutocratic , as the Shropshire bench was of aristocratic sentiment , threw out the bill . Thus no judicial inquiry could ever be had . The aristocratic and plutocratic House of Commons found itself compelled to pass a resolution to the effect that rather too many innocent men and women had unluckily been hanged and tortured . But Mr. Gordon 's petition for justice was tabled ; and when Mr. Mill attempted to move in the interest of humanity , Mr. Disraeli , as the head of the Government in the House of Commons , insulted him amidst general applause . From English courts , from English assemblies , no justice ever has , or , as it seems , will be obtained for this great wrong . That the English aristocracy and plutocracy should uphold and applaud arbitrary cruelty , and that their State Clergy should follow them , or rather , perhaps , outrun them in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aristocracy and plutocracy of England are powers , and their State clergy is a priesthood , of injustice . The only thing to be said is , that , like other powers and priesthoods of injustice before them , they have their appointed term . But that a philosophy and a philosopher teaching us that our only hope lies in discerning nobleness of character , and professing to aid us in discerning it , should , among all the characters in an age , perplexed , perhaps , and in some respects evil , but not unfruitful of generous effort or of illustrious men , have pitched upon Governor Eyre as the object of worship , and find themselves adoring him in company with State church bishops , hereditary peers , game preservers , court chaplains , tory millionaires , pinchbeck baronets , and the whole generation of fiunkeys , is surely the most remarkable end to which a philosophy and a philosopher ever came in this world . This Hero did not even display common courage : not for a moment did he expose himself personally to any danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and torture of unresisting peasants , or the judicial murder of his political opponent . If this is human nobleness , where is the opposite to human nobleness to be found ? Mr. Carlyle and his chief imitators did not fail to exhibit their personal " force " on the occasion . Mr. Carlyle called the Jamaica Committee , the leading names on which were those of John Bright , John Stuart Mill , and Thomas Hughes , " a group or knot of nigger philanthropists , barking furiously in the gutter ; and he assailed the Lord Chief Justice Cockburn for deciding against the legality of judicial assassination with a torrent of what , if it were not couched in a peculiar jargon , would be recognized as very coarse and vulgar vituperation . Mr. Ruskin , who here displayed again the manly vigor which he had exhibited in applauding the butcheries which followed the Indian mutiny , published his " more than contempt " for men whom his contempt alone would scarcely crush . Mr. Kingsley , the representative of muscular Christianity , figured at the banquet given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not only applauded the conduct of that Hero , but offered incense to aristocracy in language which surprised everybody on this side of the water , but nobody on his own . He is always squaring up in the most robust fashion at the devil ; but the sly fiend , instead of encountering his physical prowess , has got , him made Chaplain to the Queen . ( 8 . ) Once more . Mr. Carlyle 's philosophy has been brought to a practical test by his conduct in the political movement which has just taken place in his own country . No living English writer of mark has either expressed more revolutionary sentiments or done more to propagate them among men of ardent and enthusiastic character than he has . He has filled volumes with caustic and telling satire on the obsolete monarchy , with its tin-cased Champion just able to get on horseback without assistance ; on the mock aristocracy of game preservers and du cal costermongers ; on the selfishness of Corn Law landlords ; or the extinct Church , with its " pale , clammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and supervenient moonshine , " and the clergy advising you , when you are troubled about your faith , " to drink beer and dance with the girls . " Partial change would not content him . " There must be a new world , " he said , " if there is to be any world at all . That human things in our Europe can ever return - to the old , sorry routine , and proceed with any steadiness and continuance there-this small hope is not now a tenable one . These days of universal death must be days of universal new birth , if the ruin is not to be total and final . " How did he expect his new world to appear , or begin to appear ? By the miraculous interposition of Heaven , or by the effort of the people to get rid of obsolete privilege , and to put justice , capacity , and the aristocracy of nature in its place ? The English people make such an effort , not in a very alarming form ; at least , we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new British Parliament . And what does this elicit from Mr. Carlyle ? A due measure of sympathy , accompanied , as a true philosopher might effectively accompany it , with wise cautions against the shallower or more vulgar tendencies of a democratic movement , against revolutionary fanaticism and chimerical hopes ? No , but a burst of mingled spleen and panic  --  the spleen as senseless , the panic , in spite of the political transcendentalism in which it is dressed up , as miserable as that of any old tory dowager or Austrian Metternich . The practical part of " Shooting Niagara** is an appeal to the landed aristocracy to use their wealth and local influence in preparing the means of arresting political progress by force of arms , and crushing the people down again into a state of serfdom under an oligarchy of landowners . A domination of the House of Lords is the thing for which , Mr. Carlyle tells us plainly , that // he would vote , if the decision were in his power . He has come to think that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see such noble men , and such beautiful , polite women . He has persuaded himself that they are heroic souls , shut out by an adverse fate from the grander sphere of action for which they are fitted and for which they pine , and condemned to waste their nobleness , to a large extent , on racing , betting , fox-hunting , yachting , and batkues . The one hope of the nation is , that these men , being kings on their own estates ( a splendid testimony the state of the peasantry bears to their kingship I ) , should there " rhythmically " drill volunteers , use their wealth in buying dependants , and , when all is ready , restore " God-appointed order ' * with the bayonet . Is this the man who , a few years ago , wrote in relation to the Corn Laws " Of all human trades ever heard of , the trade of owning land in England ought not to bully us for drink just now "  - -  who also , a few years ago , described the English aristocracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I find that real heroic merit , more or less , was actually the origin of peerages : never till towards the end of that bad reign was peerage bargained for or bestowed on men palpably of no worth , except their money or connection . But the evil practice once begun , spread rapidly ; and now the peerage-book is what we see  --  a thing miraculous in the other extreme . A kind of Proteous flock , very curious to meet upon the high mountains , so many of them being natives of the deep . " In his parting address to the students of Glasgow , Mr. Carlyle gives them his usual advice , to " consult the Divine Oracles . " But* if the Divine Oracles turn their backs , as Castle said , upon themselves , what guidance is left to man l Let there be no mistake ; it is no transcendental aristocracy of a Utopian imagination , to whose feet Mr. Carlyle would lead his nation : it is the actual aristocracy , with its money-bags and its plush-clad flunkeys , as it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will soon be worth not far from two thirds of a million sterling annually . This , he thinks , ought to be worth something in a " vulgar " society . Wealth , thenwealth not won by industry and capacity , but to which a man is born , and which grows by the labor of others while he sleeps -- is to be the criterion of worthiness to rule ; and this is the final result of all those declamations , passionate or sarcastic , against Plutocracy and Mammon-worship , which so stirred young hearts and kindled in them the desire to emancipate society from the dominion of the money-bag . So Hudson shall have a statue ; Hudson surely above all men , since he not only made his money by self-exertion , instead of coming into it by the accident of birth , but while his fortune lasted , and he was the dispenser of railroad wealth , saw the aristocracy , with all its " bravery " and " high stoicism " and " nobleness " crowding his vulgar salons and literally cringing at his feet . Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrieking ? Who but this very king of men , Lord Derby , with the aristocracy behind him , and at his side a personage whom Mr. Carlyle , in the same page , accuses of using the nation as his milk cow , and to whom , in a former essay , he alluded with the chartered freedom of a satirist 's speech , as " the lineal representative of the impenitent thief . " And if the motive of the concession was not conviction that the measure was just , but mere weakness , panic at the destruction of the Hyde Park railings , greed of office and its perquisites , or a Jesuitical hope of debauching the residuum of the n*xv constituencies with money and beer , this will not much mend the matter . Perhaps there has not been in history such a breakdown before the whole world , of the character of any governing class , as there has been of the character of the governing aristocracy and plutocracy of England in these late years . One day they are obstinately and insolently resisting the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are plunging blindly-their very leader and Mr. Carlyle 's chosen chief calling it , in plain terms , " a leap in the dark " - into household suiffage . One ( lay they are crowding down from their dinner-tables to the House of Commons , flown with insolence and wine , to make the house ring again and again with cheers for the Alabama . The next clay , the Republican bubble not having burst , they are suing for a settlement of the Alabama question , caressing Mr. Reverdy Johnson , and claiming credit in their election addresses for their conciliatory policy towards the American Republic . Are these the rulers in whose hands a Minister of Truth can deliberately advise a nation to place itself and its hopes of political salvation ? Of course , through the whole pamphlet , there streams a blast of that cynicism which , being utterly indiscriminate , is senseless and unimproving as the east wind . No man will be led to mend himself or try to mend the community by being told never so many times or with never so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen anywhere but rottenness , roguery , lying , hypocrisy , and all kinds of vileness . This is not truth , but falsehood , and out of falsehood , once more , no truth orgood can come . Those very artisans whom , with their leaders , Mr. Carlyle , in very exact imitation of the " beautiful politeness ' * of his aristocratic associates , calls " Beales and his ragamuffins , " did they not , in this business , show , along with plenty of weak points , some force and worth , something which would render decency of language in speaking of them , wise and appropriate , as well as consonant to good breeding and philosophic self-control ? " It is better , sir , that I should be a ragamuffin than that you should want manners , " is the answer which probably many an artisan would make to such language from the lips of an educated man . The pushing down of the Hyde Park railings , on which Mr. Carlyle dolefully descants* if it was intentional , was due mainly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by its waning and vacillating opposition to the meeting , created a general impression that there would be a row , and thus drew together a crowd of idlers with the usual proportion of roughs . But it was very doubtful whether it was any thing more than a mere accident , caused by the rottenness of the old railings and the pressure of a great crowd in a narrow road . With this single exception , not one breach of law or order , not a violation of decency equal to those which the young rowdies of the aristocracy frequently , in their after-dinner Ilts of " beautiful politeness , " commit in the House of Commons , marked these great demonstrations , in which tens of thousands , and even hundreds of thousands of artisans were assembled , smarting under insult , and bent on extorting what they deemed to be their rights . In the elections , the artisan vote was given on the whole , and in comparison with the votes of other classes , independently , purely , and to the measure of the voters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisans were immensely superior to the candidates of the landed aristocracy in public spirit , ability , and legislative capacity . Had they , as a general rule , been elected , England would have had , probably , a better Parliament than she has had since the days of Ilampden , and one which would have made quick work with the Irish establishment , and have tried , at all events , to grapple with the real perils of the nation . But the artisan vote was everywhere overborne by the " two thirds of a million annually ; " with what result in the country generally , and Lord Derby 's own county in particular , let Mr. Carlyle step down to the House of Commons some evening and consider . * Mr. carlyle is very bitter on the subject of Mr. Walpole 's tears . But Mr. walpole was the nominee of Lord Derby with the two thirds of a million annually . Mr. Carlyle would treat with scorn the remark that by " ordering Mr. Beales to be kicked down stairs , " Mr. Walpole would hare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bricks are not well made nowadays , and do not last as long as they used to do-so Mr. Carlyle has , with more or less accuracy ( and we take it to be a toss-up between the more and the less ) , been informed . Very bad , and indicative , no doubt , of the prevailing want of honesty in trade , engendered by the grasping desire to grow suddenly rich , which is itself the unhappy consequence of the vast expansion of commerce during the last half century . But this , which is after all the fault more of the master brickmaker than of the workman , is hardly a sufficient reason for reducing all the laborers to slavery ; at least , unless it can be shown that the days of slavery were days free from commercial fraud , which a glance at the medkeval statute-book of England will convince Mr. Carlyle , if his mind is open to any evidence , that they were not . A reference to the history of Railway Legislation will also recall to his recollection certain proofs of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polite , when the chance of illicit gain is presented to them , were not much more to be relied upon than the makers of bricks . Has he , after all , any very good reason , personally , to complain of the workmen who produce the material conveniences and comforts of the age ? Have not his books been very tolerably printed , and brought him in a fair price ? Has he not been pretty well housed and fed ? Has he not been carried about pretty safely and swiftly on railroads ? Have not the telegraph and the penny-post served him well ? Has he not lived in a warm house , had nourishing food to eat , and been kept secure from the violence of any one who might have taken it into his head to make the philosopher a slave , and whip or hang him for not producing sounder theories ? And those two thirds of a million annually , with which Lord Derby is to carry on his drilling operations , whence are they to come ? Does not Mr. Carlyle assume that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these " eman- cipated horses , " and preserved from spoliation by their respect for property and law ? These are matters worth his consideration before he breathes thoughts of sanguinary violence , from which he would himself shrink if they were put into plain words , into hearts often as cruel , though under the mark of great outward refinement , as that of any ruffian who massacred in Jamaica , and now full of panic anger at the peril which they feel is threatening the privileges of their order . Instead of the " God-appointed order " which he desires , he will make his country and the world the scene of a worse than anarchic conflict between two factions alternately victorious and ever increasing in unscrupulousness and thirst of blood . It would be a " deluge from the Pit of Hell " indeed . " Men , " we are told in " Shooting Niagara , " " are not permitted to encourage , patronize , or in any form countenance the working , wearing , or acting of hypocrisies in this world . On the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hatred  --  to do their best in extinguishing them as the poison of mankind . This is the temper for purchasers of work ; how much more that for doers and producers of it ! Work , every one of you , like the Demiurgus or Eternal world-builder ; work , none of you , like the Diabolus or Denier and Destroyer-under penalites ! " There is no more practical force or virtue in this language , or in volumes of such language , than in the commonest and simplest exhortation to honesty and truth . It is wind , and , by sucking it , a good many of Mr. Carlyle 's disciples have become most portentous wind-bags . But such truth as there is in it is applicable , we suppose , to the producers of philosophies as well as to the producers cf bricks . If the briekmakers are bound , under awful penalties , to give us bricks that will stand the weather , the philosophers are bound to give us theories which accord with facts and will bear the test of common sense .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
