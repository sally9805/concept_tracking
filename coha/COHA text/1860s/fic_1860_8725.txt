Brian O'Linn Bedad , that I will , I 'll make up to all the girls in the County , an then I can be after taking my choice of them , but what will I do for a suit of clothes ; I could never go near a girl in these breeches , an my elbows are coming out through this ould coat , an I do nt know but what it would be a sin to call this a waistcoat ; then in regard to the stockings , I 've pulled them down over my ten toes so often , that the calf of my leg is clean down to my heels . Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn Ha , ha , ha , sorra word in hat but what 's truth , but what 's to be done for a new suit ! Brian . Brian O'Linn By the powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can borry a suit . I 'll get the loan of a pair of breeches from Dudley Dwire , an a coat from Pat Hoily . I 'll try Billy Brady for the vest , an I know the way to get a shirt , an now all as I want is a hat , so I 'll try Bridget Delaney , father O'Toole 's housekeeper , for that he 's got three as good as new : she 'll lend me one and never ax me to return it . So I am all right . Knock at the Door in F. Brian . Brian O'Linn Och , who the devil 's that . Come in an do nt be pounding the nose off the face of the door . Opens door . F. Fitzmorris enters . Och blessed St. Patrick presarve us , it 's a soger . I ask ye'er honor 's pardon for not opening the door , but I thought it was some other blaggard , that is , I thought I mean  --  I 'm kilt if I know what I thought I meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will you take a chair , ye'er honor ? Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris ( C. ) I do not wish to sit down , my good people , I have lost my way . Brian . Brian O'Linn ( L. ) Faith , an we have n't found it , ye'er honor . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Sir ! Brian . Brian O'Linn I mean ye'er honor , we have n't found anything at all , ye'er honor . Fitz .

Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn ( R. ) And his neice Miss Lucy too , ye'er honor . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Indeed ! that 's lucky  --  I will endeavor to discover something about the family and my intended , aside. you have seen Miss Lucy Dashwood then ? Mrs. Linn .

Brian O'Linn Hould ye'er tongue , an do n't be mulvathering the creater to his honor . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris It appears that Miss Dashwood is fond of taking exercise on norseback ? Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn Bedad , but she takes everything that comes in her way , hedge wall or ditch , it 's all one to her , over she goes . I mind but the other day I was hanging out some linen on the hedge beyant , when over she came wid her horse clean a top of my head , an when I said that she had kilt me , she told me to go to the devil and hurry myself , and talked me black in the face , before I could speak . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Oh , then she can talk ? Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn Faith she can , faster than her horse can gallop , and louder than a thunder clap . Brian . Brian O'Linn Och , hould ye'er tongue , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye'er honor , that ould woman is my mother , and it 's not my place to say a word agen her , but bad luck to such another ould woman in this place for talking the dacency out of any body as she is . She 'd lie the legs off an iron pot and swear a hole through the bottom of it afterwards . Sure I know the darling Miss Lucy Dashwood , and she 's the mildest spoken creater in the country . She 's so quiet that they call her a nunnery . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris A nun . I suppose you mean ? Brian . Brian O'Linn No , yer honor , I mean what I say , a nunnery . Ye see I know the differ between a nun and a nunnery ; sure , a nun 's a man , an a nunnery is a woman  --  an they call her a nun , because she 's as gentle , and never speaks above her breath . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Where have you seen her , my good man ? Brian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airing on horseback . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Then she does ride ? Brian . Brian O'Linn Yes , yer honor , she does ride  --  but then she always has a man to lead her horse by the head . She 's so marciful , she 's afraid to walk , for fear of hurting the ground wid her delicate feet . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Very considerate , upon my word , she fears to hurt the ground with her own feet , so rides on horseback . Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn Do n't believe a word he says , yer honor  --  there is n't a man that dare go near her or her horse , when once she 's mounted . Och , she 's a regular rouser !  --  that 's what she is . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris A rouser ! And what the devil is a rouser ? Brian . Brian O'Linn Och , ye see the ould woman speaks French , and rouser is the French for a angel ! Mrs. Linn . Mrs. O'Linn May the devil fly away with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madam , your opinion of the lady must be prejudiced  --  at all events , I must see and judge for myself .

Gives crown , and is putting up purse . Brian . Brian O'Linn Long life to yer honor  --  but , sir , do n't break the ould woman 's heart , if ye please . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Break her heart ! What do you mean ? Brian . Brian O'Linn Why ye see , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an it would kill her not to have a crown to put in the box as well as myself . Fitz . Captain Fitzmorris Here , my good woman  --  but I am sorry to hear you speak in such harsh terms of the lady . Giving her money  --  Brian takes it . Brian . Brian O'Linn I 'll keep it for her , sir , or may-be she might spend it out of the church  --  for we have a whisky-shop near here , and she knows the road to it . This way , yer honor .

O'Toole . Father O'Toole Well , now you must give all your money to bury him  --  for it is the law , that where persons become engaged to each other by a promise of marriage , in case of death of one , the surviving party becomes responsible to the parish for all the funeral expenses ; and as you were the first to whom he was betrothed , on you falls the entire amount . Brian . Brian O'Linn Aside . That will fix the ould one . Bridget . Bridget Delaney Oh Lord ! is it me pay all the expenses  --  and for a dead man ! Never . O'Toole .
