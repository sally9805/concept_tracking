During this chorus Fairies rise from behind set pieces and dance forward in time to the last bars of the music , and form Tableaux  --  The SPIRIT OF THE LAKE sails on in a gilded shell , and comes down and addresses the group of Fairies . Spirit . No more of that , I tell you  --  all have done . To-night , you go a journey , every one . You know , we give the Romance to the Lake , The cliff , the wood , the mountain and the brake  --  Take us away , the keenest eye could trace No Romance here  --  all would be common place .

We 'll try it now  --  my fairy word I 'll risk All they will speak and act will be burlesque . From this fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the Romance off . All take the time from me  --  now , every one  --  Start , vamose , leave , clear out , away begone . At every word of the last line , each fairy takes a step backward toward the wing , and the SPIRIT OF THE LAKE reaches the trap C. in the same manner  --  They time it so that the word " begone " takes them all off exactly together , the SPIRIT OF THE LAKE sinking through the trap  --  Music for Fairies to go off , " Araby 's Daughter , " which changes imperceptibly to " Root Hog or Die " for Fitz James ' entrance . Enter FITZ JAMES wearily R. , looking off  --  His boots and coat are splashed with mud  --  An empty flask in his hand  --  he speaks melo-dramatically with pompous gestures . Fitz . Fitz James " So crossing yonder rugged dell , My gallant steed , exhausted , fell . " Assumes a colloquial , every-day tone . That 's what the author wrote for me to say , But I sha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play . Why , what are dells or gallant steeds to me ; I 'll tell the facts without the poetry . Speaks , looking off Of all this wretched scrape , the fault is thine , My livery steed  --  my delivery 's deed is mine . I had a hired horse to hunt the stag , A dire horsetility that skinny nag Displayed ; in vain , to break my neck he tried , Himself then lay down in a bog , and died . In those deep swamps through which I 've lately been , The land lies low for such a Highland scene . Looks about admiringly . To Highland scenery so much I take , E'en that low island seen there in the Lake , Or rather in this Highland sea , so fair , Suits my nice fancy to a single hair ; Lo , I land see , to fancy , everywhere . But I must strive , as I 'm a hungry sinner Some place to find , where I can get a dinner . Oh ! for Delmonico , or Crook &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however tough  --  I 'd even eat , so little now I cares , A red , raw steak , from one of Adams ' bears . Throws up his hands in despair , when he catches the eye of the Leader of Orchestra , who strikes a few notes of " Root Hog or Die "  --  Comes back and says to the Leader . I think you 're right  --  you 're seldom in the wrong  --  I 'm in a hurry , going  --  returns , so we 'll have a song . SONG .  --  " ROOT HOG OR DIE . " I left home this morning , all for to hunt the stag , But I got into a swamp , where I lost my hired nag ; I have n't had my dinner , so I 'm hungry you may think , And I 'd give a half-a-dollar for a good square drink ; Old Bourbon whisky , lager beer or brandy  --  Oh ! I wish with all my heart that Delmonico 's was handy , For I ca n't jog along . Fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Bonny Boat . " A mountain , maid ? no ! yes , ' t is true , This mountain maid may have some mountain dew . Enter a lean horse L. 3 E. driven by a ragged boy , and towing a scow-boat with a flag , on which is inscribed , " Great Eastern "  --  ELLEN DOUGLAS is in the boat  --  Expressive music  --  As she enters , she hails the driver as if he were a long way off , putting her hands to her mouth like a speaking trumpet . Ellen . Shipmate , ahoy ! Driver . In same manner . Hello  --  o  --  o ! Ellen . Take in all sail ! Driver . Ay ! ay ! yer Honor ! He stops the horse , leaving boat near L. 2 E. Fitz . Fitz James Why , I declare , now that I look upon her , She seems to be a female salieur boy . I 'll find her out at once  --  I say  --  ahoy ! Hails her . Ellen . Having got out of boat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fitz James I really am afraid , so  --  It 's not my fault , dear maid , for I was made so . ELLEN bashfully retreats to L. C. FITZ JAMES following . A maid you are  --  and yet you man a ship  --  A man am I , who 's made a wretched slip , I 'm tired and hungry , friendless and alone  --  Holds empty flask bottom upwards . And my last friend you see 's entirely gone . Ellen . I see and sympathize  --  but , then , what would my pa say ? I have n't got a ma  --  but I 'll have marcy . Aside . ' T is plain that good society he 's seen  --  He wears a pretty color  --  Lincoln Green ; To FITZ . To take you to my humble home , I 'll dare . Fitz . Fitz James Thank you , fair belle , what is your bill of fare ? Aside . Upon my word and honor , quite polite  --  This is a clear case of love at sight . Ellen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " My boat is on the shore , my bark is on the sea . " Fitz . Fitz James And " Bark is willin ' " quite to go , you see , FITZ JAMES takes her hand , and pompously declaims . Stomach , refrain , and heart , keep up your pluck ; Luckless Fitz James , might still be less in luck . Ellen . Douglass is my name  --  my bark the one you saw go ; My home is  --  Fitz . Fitz James You need n't say  --  I know of course  --  Chicago . They go up to boat , hand in hand . Orchestra play a few notes of " My Love , she is a Lassie yet . " ELLEN and FITZ instantly stop , turn round and come down center . To LEADER . Thank you , Mr. Cooke . To ELLEN . That 's twice I 've done it  --  forgot the regular thing  --  When folks are in the direst straits , you know . Ellen . Exactly , they always stop to sing . Song @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's but a Lassie yet . Fitz . Fitz James Miss Douglas , we are strangers yet , But I hope that neither may forget , Our jolly roundelay , on this happy , happy day , Or the very funny way in which we met , I hope that we good friends may be , Each other 's merits quickly see . But before we come to that , I shall cut it very fat , And you 'll see what I 'll be at , when your dinner I see . Ellen . My hungry lad , we live pretty well , Though our bill of fare I can not tell , But I know we 'd better go , or we 'll never stand a show , At that sound , so well we know , the dinner table bell . You know I mentioned , once before , My shallop lies there on the shore , Points to boat . Do n't sing another note , but step into the boat , And gaily we will float to my father 's door . They dance up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start the horse , but the animal wo n't move . Fitz . Fitz James In boat . We are becalmed  --  be calm , my love , the gale With my own hands I 'll raise to fill our sail . I 'll raise the wind , dear  --  rest here at your ease , I think a blow or two , will raise our breeze . Gets out of boat , takes whip and reins from driver , and drives off , towing boat R. U.

Must James , who rules o'er this fair land , A Douglas meet on every hand  --  Can he no lovely maiden spy , But she must wear the Douglas eye ?

Fitz . Fitz James The tempus is a fugitive , I mind , A near refuge attemp'us now to find .

Fitz James I 'm really shocked  --  that is not etiquette . You 've killed the girl  --  what 's worse , you 've torn her petticoat . BRIAN appears back , unseen by the others . Brian . Some one may be slewed here , who can tell  --  Takes out pipe and begins to smoke  --  eyes his pipe critically . I 'm happy now , my meershaum colors well . Fitz .

Takes RED MURDOCH 'S sword and sticks it in his belt  --  Then drags RED MURDOCH off  --  Instantly returns and cautiously tries to take FITZ JAMES ' sword  --  FITZ cries " No you do n't , " and chases BRIAN off .

Dies with much difficulty , on account of the arrow  --  Music  --  Highland Fling . Blanche . Rising . Now , really , Mr. Cooke , that strain you played , Is not quite proper for a dying maid . A little slower , if you please  --  a dirge of some sort . Slow music . Thank you . I can die to that now with some comfort . Enter FITZ JAMES hurriedly  --  Sees BLANCHE . Fitz . Fitz James What , dead ! my maid  --  are all my labors vain ? Hillo ! by George ! she 's coming to again .

ELLEN and MALCOLM throw kisses at each other as long as they are in sight .  --  LADY M. following ELLEN off says : Lady M. Lady Margaret Before I put you in your nightly bunk I 'll Teach you that you can not fool your uncle . Slaps her hand in imitation of spanking . Exit R. Enter BRIAN L. He picks up MALCOLM 'S sword and sticks it in his belt . Brian .

RODERICK discovered broiling a sausage at fire , his men asleep in various positions  --  they snore an accompaniment to the music as the scene opens  --  after music RODERICK comes down front melo-dramatically to music , with sausage on the end of a long fork . Rod . Roderick Here do I take my stand , king Jim to fight , And prove which is the wrong and which the right .

This is the fellow who made love to Ellen ; He has'nt seen me yet , so there 's no tellin ' But he may tell me , if perchance he knows , The news about King Jimmy 's men  --  our foes . Fitz . Fitz James Upon the rocks , Roderick , the robber chief , Hangs out . He is the very thief I want to meet alone  --  his life will quick be ended , He hangs out now , but soon will be suspended .

I 've seen his photograph as done by Brady  --  But I 've a message for him . Rod . Roderick From a lady ? Fitz . Fitz James Yes , and I 'd give the last drop in my jug , To clap my eyes upon his squint-eyed mug . Rod . Roderick Have then thy wish . Whistles , and from the set pieces on every side RODERICK 'S men start up , they are armed with slung-shots , billies , whips , stockings with stones in the heels , brickbats , etc . Rod . Roderick These are Clan Alpine 's warriors true , And I 'm the squint-eyed Roderick Dhu .

Fitz James " Come one , come all , this rock shall fly , From its firm base , as soon as I.

Spirit . Courage , my friend , I 'll help you . Gives FITZ JAMES a silver whistle . Try , if you Ca n't whistle quite as well as Roderick Dhu . Beneath these waters here before you sighing , We always keep a standing army lying . Let Roderick and his party now beware , I 'll lend you forty Zouaves from there . SPIRIT puts her finger on her lips to enjoin silence , and runs off L. 1 E. During this time RODERICK has been encouraging his men in dumb show , and apparently getting them ready for a rush at FITZ JAMES . As the SPIRIT disappears FITZ JAMES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I vow For this kind gift  --  I 'll ( give it ) gi'vt a trial now . FITZ JAMES blows the whistle , and the flats and set pieces sink , the wings change , discovering a Highland lake in the distance , along the shores of which are drawn up in order of battle , a troop of Highland Amazons , dressed in green plaid uniforms , and under the charge of four leaders . RODERICK and his men are struck with amazement , and remain immovable . The Amazons mark time with their feet , preparatory to an onward movement . Fitz . Fitz James Benignant fairy , are all these for me ? What ! forty Zouaves ? how splendid for to see . Rod . Roderick Furiously . What ! forty Zouaves ! your logic now I see . The " Zouave-iter in mode , forti-ter in re . " RODERICK now eagerly goes to FITZ JAMES , sheathes his sword and offers his hand . FITZ JAMES takes it , and they sit down together on a rock , L while the AMAZONS go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed in line and marched down to the front , driving before them RODERICK 'S men , who rush off in confusion at the wings , crying , " POLICE , POLICE "  --  the Zouaves now perform their marches and groupings as arranged by the Ballet Master  --  at last they march off , leaving the stage clear , when RODERICK and FITZ JAMES again take the scene . RODERICK takes stage . Rod . Roderick Furiously . Now that your kilted friends have made a clearance , We 'll have our quarrel with no interference . Fitz . Fitz James Touching his breast . No fear can inter here , but there 's no occasion . Rod . Roderick There is  --  I 'll give in to no moral suasion . Fitz . Fitz James No moral sways you , I can well believe , I guess We 'll have no fight . Rod . Roderick What is that tress Striking the tress of hair in FITZ JAMES ' cap . Of hair ? can you your vengeance stifle ? You were to dip it in my brains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank you , squint-eye , for that word  --  It nerves my heart , it steels my sword , I 'll tell you what we 'll do . Rod . Roderick What is it , say ? Fitz . Fitz James I beat Red Murdoch dead first in the day , And so the battle 's ours , according to your prophet , But I do n't want to make a dead beat of it . Red Murdoch out of account we 'll throw , And let the prophecy start here and now . Rod . Roderick Agreed  --  " Who first a foeman 's head shall bust , Fitz . Fitz James His crowd shall lam ' em in the muss . " Music  --  They go up stage two or three times on opposite sides , eyeing each other  --  They then meet C. , at the back of the stage , and are about to begin , when FITZ JAMES suddenly lowers his sword , seizes RODERICK by the plaid , and drags him down to C. , when he puts the following conundrum in a loud whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tragedy ? Rod . Roderick Musingly . I do n't know . Fitz . Fitz James Because a large proportion of the audience are in tiers . Rod . Roderick That 's so , indeed ; but still the sight is cheerful , And may the house be more and more thus tierfull . ' T was cowardly to smite me thus  --  you knew A joke is an unlawful weapon  --  Fitz True . I 'll cut no more such wretched linqual capers  --  I am distracted by the funny papers . Disconsolately . Forgive me , Rod . Rod . Roderick Jimmy , I do . Wipes FITZ 'S eges with a pocket handkerchief . Cheer up , my boy , that 's right . Fitz . Fitz James I 'm sick at heart , cheerfully , however , now let 's fight . They go up stage and again prepare to fight , when RODERICK drags FITZ JAMES down to C. , and asks in a loud whisper . Rod .
