" Note .  --  This travestie was published in the " New York Mirror " on its twelfth anniversary , July , 1834 . It was introduced to the readers of the " Mirror " by an extract from an epistle of the author , as follows : " In the way of badinagr , I yesterday asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mushroom . ' She , of course , had never heard of it ; and with naivet peculiar to herself , inquired its character . I told her the term was meant to express , in the abstract , a mass of periodicals , lately set afloat in the world , to pick the pockets of readers , without entertaining or edifying them . She smiled at the conceit , and suggested the name of Doctor Fungus , as the editor . This casual hint gave existence to the following travestir , which will , of course , put your well-known modesty to the blush ; but which , I shall , nevertheless , insist upon your publishing , as the prologue for your twelfth volume . I remain , as ever , sub rose , yours truly ,  --  . " Main text ACT I.  --  SCENE I The Park , in front of the debtors ' jail . Whitey-blue posts seen in endless perspective . The City-Hall clock strikes eleven . Enter Keeper of the Park and Officer . Keeper . Keeper of the Park Has Fungus , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; It was his usual time an hour ago . Keep . Keeper of the Park At any time , sir , when you see him here , Let no unfeeling creditor come near ; I would not have him stared at . See ! who 's that , Now entered at the gate , so plump and fat ? Off . Officer Sir , ' t is the Mirror 's principal collector , With pockets lined like some pet-bank director . Keep . Keeper of the Park Leave me awhile , but be within my call . Exit Officer . Enter Finance . Good morning , sir , you 're welcome to the hall . I heard last night you had arrived express , With news of your unparalleled success . Fin . Finance Yes , sir ; and I am proud to be the man That served the Mirror since it first began . Defeated Fungus will attempt no more To cross our path , as he has done before ; No longer will his Mushroom work be known  --  The Mirror , now , securely reigns alone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think , in Jersey state , Your agent got two thousand names of late ! Has Fungus , sir , lost any friends of note ? Fin . Finance Sir , I was posted home by the first boat , Ere an account was taken of his loss ; But as I left the place , to come across Upon the railroad , it was boldly said , The Mushroom never more could raise its head ! Keep . Keeper of the Park That work , I fear 's , unlike the Mirror , sir , Too tame and spiritless to make a stir ; Worse news than this poor Fungus never met , For on his agent 's luck his all was set . Fin . Finance Ill fortune is to Fungus nothing new , sir ; He bets at random , and is still the loser ; Yet his chagrin he has the tack to hide well  --  How does he pass his time , sir , here in Bridewell ? Keep . Keeper of the Park As one whose income ne'er was half a crown , But as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads and walks , and wishes fate Had blest him with a less conspicuous state . Fin . Finance Were it not possible to see this editor ? They say he 'll talk with any but a creditor . Keep . Keeper of the Park This is his usual hour of walking out , Here , in the Park ; we 'll see him soon , no doubt ; After his morning draught he seldom fails . Here we may stand unseen , behind these pales , A while to observe how he at fortune rails . They retire . Enter Fungus . Fun . Dr. Fungus By this time the decisive blow is struck  --  Either my agents have been blessed with luck , Or I no more can send the Mushroom forth , For eighteen pence is all that I am worth ! Would I had wealth , if fate 's stern will were so , For what have we poor editors but wo ! While the rich reader pays us , if he chooses , And is content with nothing he peruses ! Fin . Finance He seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ill at ease , I 'll introduce you to him , if you please . Coming forward . Fun . Dr. Fungus Why , there 's another check to proud ambition . That man , through me , obtained his late commission ; And now I am his prisoner  --  he 's my bail , For the extended limits of the jail . Such an unlooked-for change who could believe , That saw him for his unpaid salary grieve , When I employed him as my out-door clerk ? Good morrow , Mr. Keeper of the Park . The grass looks cheerful , and the day is fair . Has any news arrived ? Whom have you there ? Keep . Keeper of the Park A gentleman of breeding and address , Who came last night from Tewksbury , express . Fun . Dr. Fungus Comes he to me with letters or advice ? Keep . Keeper of the Park He serves the Mirror , sir , let that suffice . Fun . Dr. Fungus Then he wont dun me  --  so good morning , sir , You 're welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost such myself  --  could I forget That he grows rich , while I 'm confined for debt ; Were he not called the great belles-lettres leader . I might be truly happy , and his reader . You 've canvassed in New Jersey !  --  what success ? Fin . Finance Ah ! that will reach your ears too soon , I guess . Fun . Dr. Fungus If to my loss it ca n't too soon . But tell , Are all my agents and collectors well ? And does the list of their subscribers swell ? Fin . Finance Since my arrival , sir , another post Came in , which brought us word a numerous host , Of your subscribers ' mong the Jersey hills , Have stopped their papers , and not paid their bills ! Fun . Dr. Fungus Fate , do thy worst ! the Mushroom then must slumber , I have not paper for another number ; No cash  --  no credit  --  sighs and prayers are all I have to give  --  the work , alas ! must fall ! Fin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patience and toil , and faithful friends ' adherence , Talent , and taste , and tact  --  for these have made him , Yet he pays liberally to all who aid him . His writers love a bold and active leader , And so does every male and female reader . Patrons , like women , must be warmly wooed , Such is the course our Philus has pursued . Fun . Dr. Fungus Alas ! I thought them children , all together , Pleased with a rattle , tickled with a feather . And rather hoped to win their hearts and cash With stale , old stories , anecdotes , and trash ! But literary editors , I find , Are put in trust for tastes of every kind ; And when themselves are void of wit and tact , Who can say how their patrons may not act ? Enter Officer . Off . Officer Sir , here 's a man , who told me , with a groan , He wished to see the doctor , all alone . Keep . Keeper of the Park I come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business must require Your private ear , and so I will retire ; Wishing you all the earthly good I can , Not wronging him I serve  --  the Mirror man . Exit Finance . Fun . Dr. Fungus Farewell ; alas ! who can this fellow be ? A sudden chill is running over me . I fear some heavy news . Enter Keeper . Who is't , O'Hare ? Keep . Keeper of the Park A man whose looks bespeak a world of care . A melancholy messenger , I dread , For when I asked the news , he shook his head . He comes express from Tewksbury to you , I fear his news is fatal , so adieu ! Exit . Fun . Dr. Fungus Fatal , indeed ! his brow 's a running title , That speaks the page below , a sad recital . Enter Trustall . Say , friend , how goes the work ?  --  do many stop ? Of new subscribers have you reaped a crop ? Thou tremblest , and the whiteness of thy cheek Is apter than thy tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so faint and wo-begone , So dead in look , so dull , and so forlorn , Drew Simpson 's curtain , when the night was lowery , And told him Forrest had redeemed the Bowery . Now wouldst thou say  --  " your pen did thus and thus , And thus your scissors , both enraptured us : " Stopping my greedy ear with flattery 's meed , Till in the end , to stop my ear indeed , Thou hast a sigh to change this dew to frost , Ending with scissors  --  pen  --  and  --  all  --  are lost . Trust . Trustall Your scissors yet remain , from hook impending , But for your pen  --  Fun . Dr. Fungus Why that , perhaps , wants mending ; Although I scarcely use it once a week . Yet , say , good Trustall  --  speak , I charge thee , speak ! Must we yield up our editorial fame , And let the Mirror every honor claim ? Must each competitor still lose the prize ! Tell thou thy master his suspicion lies , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thank thee for such insult to my face . Trust . Trustall Your fears are true ; the Mirror " goes ahead . " Fun . Dr. Fungus Yet , for all this , say not the Mushroom 's dead . Trust . Trustall I 'm sorry I must force you to believe , A sad disaster nothing can retrieve ; But all your Jersey patrons , sir , are lost ; They 've stopped the Mushroom , and not paid the cost ; While each of them now takes , oh ! cursed chance , The New York Mirror , paid for in advance ! They say , " that sheet , beside our Mushroom paper , Is like the sun compared to farthing taper ! Its active spirit lends a fire , that 's fanned E'en to the dullest peasant in the land ; And makes its way against all opposition , Though ever courting generous competition . " A nobler work , or one in richer dress , Was never issued from the weekly press . In fine , its editor has won the field , And your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Fungus Yet , hold ! for oh , this prologue lets me in To a vile plot  --  where have our agents been ? Why suffered they such chances to befall ? They should have given every one a call . Trust . Trustall The lucky Philus , seeking our defeat , Called for the Mushroom , and was shown a sheet ; Asking what reparation we could make , For all the articles our scissors take Without acknowledgment . When I with pride , Impatient of such taunts , indignant cried , " Hold ! most ambitious editor of York , At champagne parties first to draw a cork , While speaking with my master 's mouth , you see , I now propose the selfsame words to thee , Which thou wouldst have me answer to . " From these More words arose , and we had quite a breeze , Till , in the end , two thousand names were struck From our subscription list ! Confound the luck ! Low in the dust our scissors ' journal lies , From whence , with life ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! hadst thou stabbed , at every word thou'st uttered , Sharp scissors in my flesh , I 'd not have muttered A single oath ! Oh , heavens ! methinks I see My little pet in mortal agony ! Gorging the ravenous wolf 's insatiate crop ! But , say , did all  --  did all our patrons stop ? Trust . Trustall All but the free list  --  fifteen hundred , ten . Fun . Dr. Fungus Let them , too , stop . Inhospitable men ! Against our rigid rules , a balance due , To discontinue without paying too ! Was't not enough to have the secret blown , That we ne'er wrote a sentence of our own ; That all our pictures were from worn-out plates ; Our newest fashions all of last year 's dates ; But must you cheat us out of all we sent you ? Nor could the editor 's lost fame content you ? You never published , monsters , if you had , You 'd know the pang of being driven mad ! Trust . Trustall Take comfort , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps , will better pay . Fun . Dr. Fungus Oh ! who can tamely , and with patience fast , By thinking on an alderman 's repast , Or wander coatless , when ' t is damp and chill , By bare remembrance of a tailor 's bill ? Away ! by heavens , I shall abhor to see The man who talks of publishing to me . And when thou sitt'st up late , with good old folks , In tedious winter nights , to crack your jokes , Amuse them with the marvellous relation Of many a poor , ill-fated publication , Which , like my own , have toiled , with heart and hand , To mar the brightest Mirror in the land , And toiled in vain , but died at last unread  --  And send your hearer laughing to his bed . Exeunt omnes . SCENE II . A street in New York , near St. Paul 's Church . Enter Philus , with arms folded , la Kean . Phi . Philus Philomusus Now is the winter of our discontent Made glorious summer by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Mirror frowned , In the deep bosom of the ocean drowned . Now are our brows with laurel chaplets twined ; Our doubts and fears are given to the wind ; Eleven volumes , bound at great expense , Are now displayed as gilded monuments Of our success , filled with the choicest treasures , Engraving , music , and delightful measures ; Grim Opposition smooths his wrinkled face , And now , instead of jockeying in the race , To check our course , convinced of his mistake , Has struck his flag , and follows in our wake , But I , that am not shaped for fawning tricks , To bite , and snarl , and lick the foot that kicks , Why I shall still , without remorse or dread , In duty 's path , like Crockett , go ahead . Mid flowers of literature I 'll toil and delve , And my next step commences Volume Twelve . Exit . SCENE III . The Park . Fungus reading a pamphlet . Enter Philus and the Keeper . Phi . Philus Philomusus Good-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear , I bother you . Fun . Dr. Fungus You do indeed . Phi . Philus Philomusus Friend , leave us to ourselves ; we must confer . Exit Keeper . Fun . Dr. Fungus I owe you nothing ; what 's your business , sir ? Phi . Philus Philomusus Suspicion haunts the guilty , like a ghost , He sees a bailiff in each painted post . Fun . Dr. Fungus Where guilt without controlment , holds his sway , And steals a rival 's patronage away , An editor might fear each post a Turk ; And I , proprietor of one sweet work , Have now the fatal object in my eye , Who caused my periodical to die . Phi . Philus Philomusus Why , what a dunce was sop 's bird of night , To ape the eagle in his mid-day flight , Till Sol 's bright rays did all his powers confound , And so , for all his wings , the fool was drowned . Thou shouldst have been content as carrier , sir , And not aspired to be an editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhyming , Nor broken thus thy neck with foolish climbing . Fun . Dr. Fungus Hadst broken thine , when first thou chased a bubble , It might have saved Jack Ketch a little trouble ; But thou wast born to edify mankind , Amuse the ladies , and improve their mind ; To reach the top of fame and fortune 's ladder , While I , beneath its foot , have played the adder . How many love-sick lines and maiden sighs Hast thou to answer for ! how many eyes Of liquid blue hast thou gemmed round with pearls Bright as thy wit ; how many lovely girls Will bless the hour that gave thy Mirror birth ! The tuneful cricket chirruped in the hearth ; The mocking-bird sung , a plagiaristic sign , Foreboding many a sweet , but stolen line ; olian harps were heard upon the breeze , And , though ' t was August , blossoms decked the trees ; The kittens gambolled in their frolic play , And thrilling expectation held its sway ; Canaries warbled with their sweetest glee , And currant tarts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ printer 's pains thy printer took , ( Thy types were not by Connor nor by Cooke , ) Yet brought forth less of hope  --  I mean in size , Mottoes it had , and Algebra sublime , With much of Woodworth 's amatory rhyme ; Types in its head , like German text appeared , And if the rest be true , that I have heard , It came into the world  --  Phi . Philus Philomusus I 'll hear no more . Take this bank-note , and pay thy paper score ; I 'll puff thy work ; my censures were but feigned ; For this , among the rest , was I ordained . Fun . Dr. Fungus Oh ! and for much more generous acts than this , Just Heaven reward thee with a life of bliss ! Phi . Philus Philomusus What ! shall the aspiring hopes of talent sink , Which should have mounted ? see what tears of ink , My pen shall shed in sympathy for him , Who sought the Mirror 's downfall ; he shall swim ; And , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , down to Wall street , say I sent thee thither ; Cash it  --  ' t is genuine . Exit Fungus . Indeed , ' t is true , What Fungus told me of ; our work , when new , Came forth into the world with some acclaim , For all admired the Mirror and its frame ; The men all wondered , and the female tribe Cried , " Heaven bless us , let us all subscribe ! " And so they did , which plainly showed they prized it , And , till this hour they 've always patronized it . Stay , let me see  --  the eleventh volume 's done . No sharing spoils before the field is won . I 'll quickly sell each copy that remains : When they are gone , then must I count my gains . Exit . ACT II .  --  SCENE I. The Battery .

Here 's one that says  --  " the thrilling notes of fame , From north to south , from east to west , proclaim , The New York Mirror 's worth , to every ear , In every clime , and zone , and hemisphere ; In England , Scotland .

Philus Philomusus Thus far , before the wind , we gayly run . My fortune smiles , and no one boon refuses , Even to a chaplet from the tuneful muses ! Tell Bond to send the best upon his shelf . Epi . Epigram I fly to serve thee . Phi . Philus Philomusus Say to serve thyself . For by-and-by , claim thou of me , my cousin , ( Our work complete ) , and thou shalt have a dozen . Exit Epigram .

Epi . Epigram I hope for ages , sir , they 'll grace thy brow . Phi . Philus Philomusus Oh ! Epigram ! reluctant I proceed , To try if thou be steadfast friend indeed . Now , though thy friendly hand once took my part , When envious Slander threw a venomed dart , I would have some kind friend to aid me still . Epi . Epigram Why you have here a thousand , sir , that will . Phi . Philus Philomusus Cousin , thou wert not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I wish thy teeming skull To furnish a poetical address , About this chaplet , and the Mirror press . Epi . Epigram I must attempt whate'er your highness pleases . Phi . Philus Philomusus Indeed ! methinks thy former kindness freezes . Thou dost refuse me , then ? Epi . Epigram Allow me time To think , and I may hammer out a rhyme . Exit Epigram . Phi . Philus Philomusus I 'll henceforth deal with bards of nobler flight ; None write for me , who ca n't compose at sight . High-reaching Epigram grows circumspect , And studies hard , but seldom writes correct . Still there are traits of excellence about him ; The best on ' t is , it can be done without him  --  Better , perhaps , for did he not decline , Why , then the verses had been his , not mine . We 'll make a shift as ' t is . Come here , Finance ; Didst thou to Caustic certain sums advance ? Fin . Finance I did , sir . Phi . Philus Philomusus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ourselves would speak a word with him to-day . Exit Finance . This plodding Epigram no more shall be The neighbor of my councils .

Stanley I hear , my liege , that Sedley has grown Jealous , And will get up a paper of his own , And vows the Mirror shall be overthrown . He calls his sheet the Comet , and has paid A year 's advance for your Counndrum 's aid . Phi . Philus Philomusus Why let him go , we 've many such to spare . Hark thee , friend Selim , where is Mrs. Thayer ? Selim . Selim In the far West , I hear she 's teaching school . Phi . Philus Philomusus I 'll write to her , before my purpose cool . Enter Epigram .

And put in our poetical address . By heaven , this news my stirring soul alarms , And all my energies are now in arms ! Come forth , my honest pen ! which , here I vow , Shall not again be dry as it is now ; Ne'er shall these watching eyes have needful rest , Till these apostates have been skinned and dressed , Ne'er shall these limbs on downy bed regale Till I have seized this Comet by the tail !

Our comet still shall sweep along its path , To some a fearful visitant of wrath , To others , light  --  then let it still on high Brandish its fiery tresses in the sky , And with them scourge the bad , revolting " stars , " That have consented to the loud huzzas , Which greet The New York Mirror every week , Whose worth we envy , and whose fall we seek . When beggars die , there are no Comets seen ; The " Mushroom " fell , and all went on serene ; But ere the mightiest Julius fell , in Rome , Stars dropped down blood , portentous of his doom ! So , ere the aspiring Mirror tumble down , Our sweeping " Comet " startles all the town . Con . Conundrum Your words have fire , my lord , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our foe . Sed .

On one side the compositors are seen at their cases , on the other are steam-presses , in full operation . Stage dark . Enter Philomusus from a closet . Phi . Philus Philomusus ' T is now the dead of night , and half the town Are sleeping on their beds of  --  straw or down , Yet I , with all my care-worn thoughts , mayhap , Shall not be able to procure a nap . The clock strikes twelve ! and hark ! from room to room The sounds of printing-engines pierce the gloom : Press answers press with clank of iron wheels , While from each case a fainter murmur steals , The clink of types in the composing-sticks , Of which compositors scarce see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning 's literary war . My stern impatience chides this night 's delay , Which limps so slow and tediously away . I 'll to my closet , and attempt once more , To catch a snooze , for I must stir at four . Ha ! what sweet sounds are those which greet my ears ! Music is heard . Sure ' t was the music of the tuneful spheres , Or the soft warblings of a seraph 's lyre ! No matter what it was  --  I must retire . Lies down  --  sleeps  --  dreams . Music . Vision of Apollo and the Muses , who approach his couch , and Apollo holds a laurel crown over the sleeper 's head , while goddesses appear to kiss him ! Apollo . Apollo O thou , whose courage , sleeping or awake , Not all the terrors of thy foes can shake , Where conscience and where friends thy course approve , Sleep on , while I , commissioned from high Jove , With dreams of rapture sweeten thy repose , And give thee confidence to meet thy foes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his head , Scatter roses o'er his bed ; Philomusus , friend of ours , We will strew thy couch with flowers ; Philus , persevere in duty , Friend of virtue  --  friend of beauty ; Thus we virgin sisters nine , Thus thy brows with garlands twine ; Dew ambrosial thou shalt sip , Take it from each Muse 's lip . They each stoop and kiss him . Philus , persevere in duty  --  Friend of virtue  --  friend of beauty . Apollo . Apollo The morning 's dawn has summoned us away , Now Philomusus , wake , without delay ! Ere blaze of noon has drowned the morning 's beam , Thou shalt have realized this pleasing dream ; Philus , awake ! thy hopes and means are ample  --  Awake ! to gifted minds a bright example . Lively music . Philomusus starts from his couch , and rushes to the front , la Kean . Phi . Philus Philomusus Give me another wreath !  --  another kiss !  --  Thanks , bright Apollo ! for this hour of bliss ! Ha ! was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Caustic I 'll fly to Jansen 's , sir , and get you ten . Phi . Philus Philomusus Slave ! must I wait at such a time for thee ? When every second is a century ! I think there be six " Comets " in the fray , Five have I pulled down by the beard to-day , Instead of Sedley 's  --  but I 'll try again  --  A pen  --  a pen  --  my kingdom for a pen !

Gamut , push on ! with buckler , shield , and targe ; Level long-toms , good Leggett , at his hull , And let a shower of grape salute his skull ; With whole broadsides of tales assail the dolts , ' Twixt wind and water , sir  --  drive home their bolts !

A most glorious flourish , in the midst of which a bright and fiery comet , accompanied by a shower of stars , is seen to fall into the North river , where it expires in a hiss , in which it is expected all the audience will participate . Shouts of victory succeed , and the curtain falls amid thunders of applause .
