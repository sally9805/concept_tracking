txt ROGER BROOKE TANEY . A LITTLE more than two centuries ago , Thomas Hobbes of Malmesbury published his great treatise on government , under the title of " Leviathan ; or , the Matter , Form , and Power of the Commonwealth , Ecclesiastical and Civil , " - in which he denied that man is born a social being , that government has any natural foundation , and , in a word , all of what men now agree to be the first principles , and receive as axioms , of social and civil science ; and declared that man is a beast of prey , a wolf ; whose natural state is war , and that government is only a contrivance of men for their own gain , a strong chain thrown over the citizen , - organized , despotic , unprincipled power . To this faithless and impious work , which at . least did good by shocking the world and rallying many of the best minds to develop and defend the true principles of society and the state , he put a fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leviathan , the Sovereign State , the Mortal God ,  --  a gigantic figure , like that of Giant Despair or the horrid shapes we have sometimes seen pictured as brooding over the Valley of the Shadow of Death , - a Titanic form , whose crowned head and mailed body fill the background and rise above the distant hills and mountain-peaks in the broad landscape which is spread out below , with fields , rivers , harbors , cities , castles , churches , towns and villages , and ships upon tie seas and in the ports . Its body and limbs are made up of countless human figures , of every class , all bending reverently toward the sovereign head . Its arms stretch forward to the foreground . In one hand it holds a magnificent crosier , in the other a mighty sword , which reach across and cover the whole . It is surrounded with en*blems of power , of which it is the life and embodiment . In the front is a fortified city , with its streets and gate , its cathedral rising high above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag flying from the forts , the sentinel on the ramparts . Its fortresses seem to defy and command the whole empire over which LeviatVn predominates . To show more fully how all-pervading and resistless is the power of this monster made of mortal men , and the means and extent of its control in Church and State , to impress the senses , the emblems of its spheres and its instruments are depicted below . First is a castle on a rocky hei0ht , with the smoke rolling from its battlements , from which a cannon has just been fired ; opposite , a church , with a figure holding the cross above its roof of faith ; here a coronet , opposite a mitre ; here is a cannon , to thunder in civil war ; opposite are the mythic thunderbolts for the fulminations of the Church ; below are arms , drums , banners and flags , helmet and halberd , spear and sword and matchlock ; opposite appears a front , between the devilish horns of which , marked " dilemma , ' is formed a sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labelled " syllogism , " and bifurcated weapons , named " real and intentional , " " spiritual and temporal , " and one beyond whose long straight point , labelled " direct , " there is another sharp , keen one , curving round and covering it , labelled " indirect " ; last is the battle-field , with armies rushing together in deadly charge , their flags flying above the long lines whose sloping spears bristle above the clouds of smoke and dust , the cavalry and foot engaged with sabres and pistols , men anil horses fallen , the victors , the wounded , the dying , and the dead , - the dread arbitrament of war ; opposite , the judges ranged in formal order , with their caps and black robes , - a Rhadamanthine tribunal . Seeing such a summary and embodiment of his idea , a man will shudder the more he ponders on such a conception of the state as such a monstrous idol , which men have fashioned out of their own bodies and invested with the attributes of superhuman power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peace and Order , Truth and Religion , and served and obeyed as their Tyrant and King . The American state , - which , as Franklin said , " first set forth religious truth as the basis ofgdvernment , " formed by the people , who , calling on all mankind to witness their solemn appeal to the Supreme Judge of the world , " pledged themselves , " as Adams said , " to extinguish Slavery as soon as practicable , " - the state formed to establish justice , - the state for which the founders reverently adopted as the true emblem the Goddess of Liberty , - had , at the time when Slavery , the patricide , waged this war to finish the revolution already almost complete , so essentially changed , that it bore a striking resemblance to that dreadful picture of the giant form of the Leviathan . Poy5ulus Rorna9zus re/5ellte factus est alius . It will be difficult to decide which branch of our government was most efficient in producing this change ; as it will be difficult for one who considers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juggernaut was constructed , to decide which would be the more horrible , a decision by battle or by the // robed ministers of evil . But as the Leviathan , Slavery , - the Mortal God , the incarnation of Evil , - is growing more and more shadowy , and men again behold the heavenly Guardian of their State , Americans feel , and the world agrees , that war , though it reaches other classes and in different form , is really attended with less horror and woe at the time than several judicial decisions have occasioned ; and that the lasting results of battles are incalculably more insignificant than the judgments of courts may be . Roger Brooke Taney was , when nearly sixty years old , placed at the head of the Judiciary , at a critical time in American affairs . The Slave Power , so suc : cessful in extending its dominion , and already the controlling influence in the government , was pressing its unholy and arrogant demands openly and without shame . It had destroyed civil liberty in the Slave States , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stifling the right of petition in Congress , and smothering free speech in the States . The Executive was recommending that the mails should be sifted for its safety . The question of the right of Slavery in the Territories and the Free States was taking form , and the slave-catchers claimed to hunt their prey through the Northern States , without regard to the rights of freemen or the law of the land . Taney had long been knQwn as an astute and skilful lawyer , a man of ability and learning in his profession - as ability and learning are commonly gauged . He had been Attorney-General of Maryland , and in 1831 had been appointed Attorney-General of the United States . He was an ardent partisan supporter of the administration ; and in 1833 , when Duane refused to remove the deposits , he was appointed to the Treasury as a willing servant , and did not hesitate to do what was expected of him . In 1835 , while the country was deeply agitated by questions concerning the rights of States and the powers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Bench . His opinions on those questions were well known , and the consideration of his nomination indefinitely postponed . But some time after the death of Chief Justice Marshall , which occurred on the 6th of July , 1835 , Taney was nominated as his successor , and in 1836 , the political complexion of the Senate having in the mean time changed , was confirmed by party influence , and took his seat at the head of the Judiciary in January , 4137 . He was essentially a partisan judge , as much so as were the judges of King Charles , who decided for the ship-money in accordance with their previously announced opinions . The President wrote him a letter in which he thanked him for abandoning the duties of his profession and promptly aiding him by removing the deposits ; and Webster dedared he was the pliant tool of the Executive . The Massachusetts , Kentucky , and New York cases in the very first volume of the Reports showed that , if not swift to do the work for which he had been selected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial decisions . But we do not intend to examine these , or to review the long series of decisions , extending over more than a quarter of a century , and through more than thirty volumes , on the common or even the grander questions discussed in that tribunal , which will all , or nearly all , be unknown , - saye to the profession , - and will have but little influence on the welfare of the country and the course of history . We would consider only the more important of those decisions touching Slavery , the cause of this Revolution , which have already shaped the course of events , and become the record of his character as a jurist , a patriot , and a man . His private Qpinions about Slavery are not matter of comment or inquiry . There are two o*cial opinions given by him while Attorney-General in 1831 which relate to the matter . In one of these he had to consider whether the United States would protect the right of a slave - master over his slave , em- // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the States , in which he expressed the opinion that the United States could not , by treaty , control the several States in the exercise of their power of declaring a slave free on being brought within their limits . In the other , he held that a person removing his slaves with him to Texas , merely for a temporary sojourn , and with the intention of returning again in a short time to the United States , might safely bring his slaves back with him . But he then declared , that if the owner had placed his slaves in Texas as their domicile , he woutd be liable to prosecution , under the act of Congress , if he should bring them back into the United States . In 1837 , the very year Taney took his seat on the Supreme Bench , he gave the opinion of the Court in the cases of the Garonne and the Fortune , two vessels libelled , under the act of i8i8 , for bringing as slaves into New Orleans persons who had , in 1831 and 1835 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The judge then said that , " assuming that by French law they were entitled to freedom , there is nothing in this act to prevent their mistress bringing them back and holdinb them as before . " He seems to have considered it immaterial , or to have been ignorant , that , in accordance with the maxim , " Once free , forever free , " declared in the courts of his own State of Maryland , the courts of Louisiana held , as did those of Kentucky and other States also , that , " haying been for one moment in France , it was not in the power of her former owner to reduce her again to slavery , " and to have forgotten the doctrines of one of his own opinions . Slavery , when he came upon the bench , began to look to the Supreme Court as its surest defence . The Prigg case , as it is called , or , as lawyers call it , Prigg vs . The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania , was an amicable suit ; the parties in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were represented by the ablest counsel , who came into court , as Johnson , Attorney-General of Pennsylvania , said , " to terminate disputes and contentions which were arising , and had for years arisen , along the border line between them , on the subject of the escape and delivering up of fugitive slaves . " The counsel regarded themselves , as he said , as engaged in " the work of peace , " and " of patriotism also . " Edward Prigg and otl*ers were indicted in Pennsylvania for kidnapping a negro woman on the 1st of April , 1837 . The cause came to trial before the York Quarter Sessions , May 22 , 1839 ; and the counsel agreed that a special verdict should be taken and judgment rendered , and . thereupon the case carried up , so as to present the questions of law arising , under the Penn*ylvania Emancipation Act of 1780 , upon the United States act of 1793 touching fugitives from labor , and the statute of Pennsylvania passed in 1826 , which provided for the seizure and surrender of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case was made up and presented in that spirit of compromise which has been the bane and delusion of America , ( as if there could be any compromise of justice , ) - the counsel for Pennsylvania claiming that their statute was auxiliary to that of the United States , really beneficial to Slavery , and that they advocated the true interests of the South as well as of the Union and the North , - in order to have the Judiciary authoritatively settle the vital question of the rights of the master in the seizure , and of the States in the rendition , of fugitive slaves . The Court decided , fully , that the master had a right to seize his fugitive slave wherever he could find him , and take him back without process ; that the law of 1793 was constitutional ; and that the United States had the exclusive power of legislation on that matter . But this did not satisfy Chief Justice Taney . He agreed that the master had the right of seizure . He declared that this right was the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to abrogate or alter it , and foreshadowed the // idea that the Constitution carried Slavery over all the Territories and States . But he dissented from the Court when they held the Pennsylvania act to he invalid . And without relying on any principle , without any discussion of ; or the slightest allusion to , any authorities or the great fundamental questions involved in that issue , he coolly depicted the inconveniences the slave-catcher might he subject to in States where there was but one District Judge , and how essentially he would be aided by the State legislation ; and pointed out to bis brethren those " consequences " which they did " not conte ; nj5 late , " and to which they " did not suppose the opinion they had given would lead . " And he said that , where the States had such statutes , " it had not heretofcwe been supposed necessary , in order to justify those laws , to refer them to the questionable rowers of internal and local police . They were believed to stand upon surer and safer grounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lawful owner . " Counsel said , " The long , impatient struggle on that question was nearly over . The decision of this Court would put it at rest . " It was not so . This decision was made in 1843 . But from that time the strife over that question was more violent than ever . The Slave Power took this decision as a new concession and guaranty . It certainly affirmed the right of the master to exercise his absolute power , in the most offensive form , to be beyond control of all legislation whatever , State or National . The Court doubtless meant , as the States and the counsel did , by giving to Congress the exclusive power of legislation on the surrender of fugitives from labor , to settle this question in such form as to satisfy the Slave Power . If the opinion of Mr. Webster be worth anything , they forgot the maxim , " Judicis estjus dicere , non dare . " Most surely Taney ignored his State-Rights doctrines when , looking far on for the interests of Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States authorized to legislate on the matter ; and , disguising the poison UnRoger Brooke Taney. 55 der the phrase , " the Constitution and every clause of it is part of the l*tw of every State of the land , " he put forth the dogma that the rendition clause merely provided for the rights of citizens , " put them under protection of the General Government , " and made " the rights of the master the law of each State . " He was declaring a rule of government , not a rule of law , and creating a theory for the defence of property in man . In I85o he went a step farther . A Kentucky slave-owner had been in the habit of letting some of his slaves go into Ohio to sing as minstrels . He filed a bill against a steamboat and her captain to recover the value of those slaves , who , after their return , had been carried across the river and escaped . It must be remembered that they had not first escaped , but had been carried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the principles presented and fairly involved in such an issue , again looking far on to consequences in the interest of Slavery , again ignoring , not only the first principles of jurisprudence and the declared ends of the Constitution , but even his own political State-Rights doctrine , ( for if these men had not escaped , why could not Ohio free them ? ) he declared a doctrine pregnant with mischief ; - that each State had . the absolute right to decide the status of all persons within its limits . This , too , has gone with war . But his intent is none the less clear . The theory was obviously stated with a far - reaching view to remote consequences . And it must be considered in connection with the fact that , in lieu of the old rule which had been recognized by the Slave States , that a slave , by being carried to a Free State or domiciled for a day in a foreign country by whose law he was enfranchised , was liberated forever , - once free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to assert a new rule for re*nslavement by recapture and on return . But the Slave Power , having controlled the executive and directed the legislative branch of the government , again // turned to judicial power as the surest , and best able to work out easily the largest and most lasting results . The Dred Scott case was begun in 1854 , and brought up , twice argued , and finally decided in 1856 ; Chief Justice Taney delivering the opinion of the Court . The facts and result of that case are well known . In a cause dismissed for want of jurisdiction , this Court pretended to decide that no person of African slave descent could ever be a citizen of the United States , and that the adoption of the Missouri Compromise line by the Congress of 1820 , acquiesced in for thirty-five years , was unconstitutional . This doctrine was entirely extrajudicial , and , as one of the judges declared , " an assumption of authority . " We do not propose to discuss this decision . It was the lowest depth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revive the spirit of liberty , - to recall the country to the principles of the founders of the Constitution . It began the good work , - evoking the truth , by showing its own fiendish principles , - which the war is likely to finish forever . We wish , however , to give an analysis of the doctrines and reasons on which his decision was based , and therefrom to show what is the true place of Roger Brooke Taney as a jurist and a patriot . Now the course of his argument was this , - admitting that all persons who were citizens of the several States at the time of the adoption of the Constitution became citizens of the United States , to show that persons of African descent , whose ancestors had been slaves , were not in any State citizens . Arid first , he tries to show this " by the legislation and histories of the times , and the language used in the Declaration of Independence " ; and after referring to the laws of two or three Colonies restricting inter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , colored persons were in all the Colonies held to be no part of the people , and declaring that " in no nation was this opinion more uniformly acted upon than by the English government and people , " admitting that " the general words all men are created equal , ' etc. , would seem to embrace the whole human family , " and that the framers of the Declaration were " high in their sense of honor , and incapable of asserting principles inconsistent with those on which they were acting , " he argues that , because they had not fully carried out , and did not afterwards fully carry out , their avowed principles by instant and universal emancipation , therefore he can give to as plain and absolute words as were ever written , expressive of universal laws , a force just opposite to their terms ; - a new form of argument , whichbegins by assuming the truth of the proposition desired , and ends by denying the truth of the admitted premises . He then proceeds to inquire if the terms " we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the persons in question . Here , too , he admits that they did embrace all who were members of the several States . Then , turning round the power given Congress to end the slave-trade after i 8o8 , and arguing from it as a reserved right to acquire property till that time ; laying aside the fact that the framers of the Declaration had acted on their declared principles , and that in many States , as in Massachusetts and Vermont , even in Southern States , as in North Carolina they remained till 1837 , many freed colored persons were citizens at that time , with the remark , that " the numbers that had been emancipated at that time were but few in comparison with those held in slavery , " assuming that the very acts of the States suppressing the slave-trade helped instead of destroying his argument ; arguing from the fact that Congress had not authorized the natur*lization of colored persons , or enrolled them in the militia ; arguing even from State laws passed in the most passionate moments as late as 1833 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1717 , and of Massachusetts in 1705 ; even coming down to the fact that Caleb Cushing gave his opinion that they could not have passports as citizens ; denying that the " free inhabitants " in the Articles of // Confederation , which he was forced to concede did in terms embrace freedmen , actually did include them , because the quota of land forces was proportioned to the white inhabitants , - he affirmed that they were not and never could become citizens , that neither the States nor the nation had power to lift them from their abject condition . The United States could naturalize Indians . But neither the United States not the individual States could make colored persons citizens . The Chief Justice stated that colored persons were not , at the time of the adoption of the Constitution , citizens under the laws of the several States and the laws of the civilized world . But he knew , for it had been shown to him in the arguments , that such persons , and many who had been slaves , were then citizens in Massachusetts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likewise were in Vermont , Pennsylvania , and in other States . And he knew-for in 1831 he himself said it was " a fixed principle of the law of England , that a slave becomes free as soon as he touches her shores * - that he declared as law what was not the law of civilized nations ; that in 1762 Lord Northington declared that " as soon as a man sets foot on English ground he is free " ; and thatLord Mansfield had , in 1772 , held that " Slavery is so odious that it can not be established without positive law . " He knew ( or he declared what he did not know ) . that at that day the sentiment in France was so directly to the contrary , that in 1791 the law was " Tout individu est Zibre aussit*t quit est en France . " At the time to which he referred , public opinion in the American States and in foreign countries , and the legislation of the various States , were just the opposite of what he stated them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly the sentiment of the country and of states in amity with it than at any other . The assertion , that colored persons could not be and were not citizens of the several States , was simply false . In most if not in all of the States such persons were citizens . In 1776 , the Quakers refused fellowship with such as held 157 slaves ; and that sect , through all the States , enfranchised their slaves , who , on such enfranchisement , became citizens . American courts were not behind the English courts . States adopted the language of the Declaration into their Constitutions for the purpose of universal emancipation , and the courts decided that that was its effect . At the time of the adoption of the Constitution the leading men of all sections considered emancipation essential to the realization of the American idea ; for their government was founded on a theory , and avowed principles , which rendered it necessary , and which , with the performance of the pledges of the States and the exercise of the powers directly given to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taney even argued that persons of African descent could not be citizens , because then they could " enter every State when they pleased , without pass or passport , and without obstruction , to sojourn there as long as they pleased , to go where they pleased , at every hour of the day or night , without molestation , unless they committed some violation of law for which a white man would be punished ; and it would give them full liberty of speech , in public and in private , upon all subjects upon which its own citizens might speak , to hold public meetings , " and " to bear arms As if this would not be to a true jurist and just judge expounding a Constitution made " to establish justice " itself the ground for deciding that citizenship was opened to them by emancipation ; as if the blessings of liberty ought not to prevail over any inconveniences to slave-holders . His argument from subsequent legislation was perfectly idle . For , at most , the statutes of Naturalization and Enrolment merely showed that Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power given to them in absolute terms , and which he admits they had as to Indians . While in other statutes , as that of 1803 , of Seamen , and in several treaties , as , for instance , those whereby Louisiana , Florida , and New Roger Brooke Thney. // Mexico were acquired , colored persons are expressly named as citizens . Having denied the clear facts of history , renounced the obligation of explicit language , professed to stand on an argument every member of which was destructive of his conclusion , he thus stated the result : " They were at that time , " 1789 , " considered as a subordinate and inferior class of beings , who had been subjugated by the dominant race , and , whether emancipated or not , yet remained subject to their authority , and had no rights or privileges but such as those who held the power and the government might choose to grant them " ; that the opinion had obtained " for more than a century " that they were " beings of an inferior order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to respect , " who " might justly and lawfully be reduced to slavery , " " an ordinary article of merchandise and traffic wherever a profit could be made of it " ; and this opinion was then " fixed and universal in the civilized portion of the white race , " - " an axiom in morals as well as politics . " He then declares , that to call them " citizens " would be " an abuse of terms " " not calculated to exalt the character of the American citizen in the eyes of other nations. ** No wonder the nations pointed the finger of scorn , and cried out , " Is this the perfection of beauty , the joy of the whole earth ? Shade of Jefferson ! is this the reading America was to give the Declaration ? Did you publish a lie to the world ? Spirits of Franklin , Adams , and Washington ! is this your work ? Americans ! is this your char-acter ? " He declares , further , that the Court has no right to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks in the same words , with the same meaning and intent , with which it spoke when it came from the hands of its framers , and was voted on and adopted by the people of the United States . Any other rule of construction would abrogate the judicial character of this Court , and make it the mere reflex of the popular opinion or passion of tle day . This Court was not created by the Constitution for such purposes . Higher and graver trusts have been confided to it ; and it must not falter in the path of duty ! " Would to God it had not faltered in the path of duty , that it had been true to those higher and graver trusts ! Would that it had not been the mere reflex of popular opinion or the passion of the day , that it had not abrogated its judicial character ! Would that it had read the plain words in the holy spirit in which they were written ! Would that it had left the Constitution as it was , and , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instrument that Constitution would be , if fearlessly used to carry out the great principles of humanity for which its preamble declares it was established ! Here is the key to the new distinction between the Constitution as it is and the Constitution as it was . But as it was in the beginning , so it is and shall be . But Taney could not stop here . Compromises had been made through th' other branches of the government , - compromises held sacred for more than a generation , in the vain hope to appease the insatiate lust of the Slave Power . He went on with a longer and lower argument to declare one branch of the Compromise - the act of Congress prohibiting slavery in territory north of 36* 30 ' void . Even more , - for he seemed determined to make clean work of it , - he went on to say that a slave who had been made free by . being taken ( not esc*iping , but by being carried by his owner ) to a Free State was reduced to slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been taken , and that that was the result of Strader vs . Graham , which declared that the shitus of persons , whether free or slave , depended on the State law . Here , again , he sacrificed his cherished party principles to his love for Slavery . Else how could the State to which the slave had been carried be deprived of its right to enfranchise , or how could the United // S States power be extended further than to the expressly granted case of escape ? But no . He was a judicial Calhoun . His dogma was that the fundamental law guaranteed property in man . He declared that therefore Congress could not interfere with it in the Territories . Before he was judge , he admitted the right of sojourn . There was but one step more , - the sacred right of slave property in Free States . It was involved in what he had already said , and was not so great an anomaly as he had already sanctioned ; for if the Constitution guarantees this property in every State , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with it , - if , in case of escape , Congress has the power to reclaim it , - why is not the owner to be guaranteed it in the States* as well as in the Territories In looking across this long judicial Sahara of twenty-seven years , there is but one oasis . In the Amistad case , the Court did declare that Cinque and the rest , who had been kidnapped , had the right to regain their natural liberty , even at the cost of the lives of those who held them in bondage ; and for once the Court , speaking by Story , did appeal to the laws of nature and of nations , and decide the case " zq5oiz Ike eternat*rinc*ples of justice . " But all else is , in the light of this question of Slavery , by which this age will be remem bered and judged , a dreary , barren waste of shifting , blinding , stifling sand . History will tell whether America is to be judged by the words spoken by him who so long held the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has fallen to such a depth . He did not speak for her ; but he did for himself . By this record will the world judge Chief Justice Taney . His great familiarity with the special practice ; his knowledge of the peculiar jurisdiction of his tribunals ; his acquaintance with the doctrines and decisions of the common law , with equity and admiralty ; his opinions on corporate and municipal powers and rights , on land claims , State boundaries , the Gaines case , the Girard will , on corporations ; his de 59 cisions on patent-rights and on copyrights ; his opinions extending admiralty jurisdiction to inner waters , on liability of public officers , and rights of State or national taxation , on the liquor and passenger laws , on State insolvent laws , on commercial questions , on belligerent rights , and on the organization of States , - after doing service for the day in the mechanical branch of his craft , will soon be all forgotten . But the slavocrats ' revolution of the last two generations , and the Secession war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theme of the world ; and he , of all who precipitated ' them , will be most likely , after the traitor leaders , to be held in infamous remembrance ; for he did more than any other individual , - more than any President , if not more than all , - more in one hour than the Legislature in thirty years , - to extend the Slave Power . Indeed , he bad solemnly decided all and more than all that President Buchanan , closing his long political life of servility in imbecility , in December , i 86o , asked to have adopted as an " explanat6ry amendment " of the Constitution , to fully satisfy the Slave Power . Well would it have bern for that Power , for a while at least , had its members recollected that " no tyranny is so secure , none so remediless , as that of executive courts " ; well for them , - if it is better to rule in hell than serve in heaven , - but worse for the world , had they been patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature relieved itself . War came , not the ruin , but the only salvation , of the state . The movements of events have been so rapid , the work of generations being done in as many years , that Taney 's character is already historic ; and we can judge of it by his relation to the great event which alone will preserve it from oblivion . In judging his public character as the head of the Judiciary of America , consider the cause he sought to promote , his motives , the means he used , his resources as a jurist and a lawyer in that cause , the intended effect and actual results . // And of the cause this must he said and agreed by all , that there was never one of which a court could take cognizance in Am*rica , England , or the world so utterly evil and infamous as that of Slavery in the United States . Did he realize its extent ? Yes , there were " few freedmen compared with the slaves , ** say only sixty thousand out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in repudiating the promise made for those seven hundred thousand , a pledge made with the most solemn appeal to man and to God , he utterly destroyed the rights and hopes of four million men . He knew he was deciding , for a vast empire , weal or woe ; and he knew it was woe , or he had no sense of justice . And his motives ? He was not venal , not corrupt , not a respecter of persons . But there is something had besides venality , Corruption , and personal partiality . The worst of motives is disposition to serve the cause of evil . The country k ? iows , the world will declare , none served it so well . But was he conscious of serving it ? Yes ,  --  unless the traitors so eagerly sought to put all these interests under his jurisdiction without motive , - unless his eager and unnecessary , and , as was declared and is now agreed , assumed jurisdiction over it , his " far-seeing ' * care and untiring defence of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - unless all these , and his manner , their motives , and the assured results , coincided so as by the law of chances was impossible , - he was conscious . To deny it is to say that he was imbued with the spirit of evil . The world knows by what means he assumed to settle these questions . We have seen something of the nature of his arguments . With these , too , men are somewhat familiar , and by these let them judge of him as a jurist . There is not in them all one faint recognition of the axioms of law , - one position founded on the laws of nature or the rules of eternal justice and the right , - one notice of the great primal rules laid down by all jurists and great judges of ancient and modern times , orofthe precepts of religion by which any magistrate in a Christian land must expect to he governed , or to be held infamous forever . Nay , more : he does not recognize at all those fundamental pi*nciples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the first lines ofboth . He did worse than torture and pervert language : he reversed its meaning . He denied the undoubted facts of history . He denied the settled truths of science . He slandered the memory of the founders of the government and framers of the Declaration . He was ready to cover the most glorious page of the history of his country with infamy , and insulted the intelligence and virtue of the civilized world . Where , outside his " aviorn in morals and tolitics , " can he found so monstrous a combination of ignorance , injustice , falsehood , and impiety ? Ignorant of the meaning of an " axiom** denying the truths of science ; falsifying history ; setting above the Constitution the most odious theory of tyranny , long before exploded ; scoffing at the rules of justice and sentiments of humanity , - he tied in a knot those cords which must end the life of his country or he hurst in revolution . He well knew , too , what would he the effects of his decision . Avowedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and the ancient law at the feet of the Slave Power . The passions of a mighty people never raged more fiercely than whilst that last cause was before his court ,  --  save in open war ; and there was almost war then . He well knew nothing would so force them.to desperation ,  --  the desperation of unlicensed barbarism or the immovable determination of truth and justice driven to the wall . He knew , or if he did not , was so ignorant that he was incompetent , that in such a contest on such fundamental principles , such a decision must end in revolution and civil war . If he dreamed of peace , then he was ready to seal the doom of four million , and at the end of this century of ten million souls . In all these decisions he appeals to 6o February , // no one great principle . There is little in all his judgments to raise him above the rank of respectable jurists ; and in these , presenting the fairest occasion ever offered to a true lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will not cover his name with infamy , where , on far lesser occasions , Hale and Holt , Somers and Mansfield , covered theirs with honor , and added to the glory of their country , and did good to mankind . He was not , indeed , of that class of the bad to which the profane Jeifreys and Scroggs and the obscene Kelyng belong . But he was as prone to the wrong as was Chief Justice Fleming in sustaining impositions , and Chancellor Ellesmere in supporting benevolences for King James ; as ready to do it as Hyde and Heath were to legalize " general warrants " " by expositions of the law " ; as Finch and Jones , Brampton and Coventry , were to legalize " shipmoney " for King Charles ; as swift as Dudley was under Andros ; as Bernard and Hutchinson and Oliver were in Colonial times to serve King George III. ; as judges have been in later times to do like evil work . Some of these , perhaps , had no conscious intent to do specific wrong . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of evil . But this question of Slavery towers above all others that Taney ever had to consider ; America professed a loftier standard of justice than England ever adopted ; the question of the liberty of a race is more important , the question whether the State is founded on might or on right is more vital , than those of warrants and ship-money , benevolences and loans ; and Roger Brooke Taney sinks below all these tools of Tyranny . Hobbes said , that , " when it should be thought contrary to the interest of men that have dominion that the three angles of a triangle should equal two right angles , that truth would be suppressed . " Taney did deny truths far plainer than that , - the axioms of right itself . He did more than any other man to make actual that awful picture of the Great Leviathan , the Mortal God . How just , how true , were those last symbols of the State founded on mortal power ! The end of the dread conflict of battle is the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those he served themselves with the sword cut the knot he so securely tied ; his own State was tearing off the poisoned robe in the very hour in which he was called before the Judge of all . America stood forth once more the same she was when the old man was a boy . The work which he had watched for years and generations , the work of evil to which all the art of man and the power of the State had been subservient , that work which he sought to finish with the fatal decree of his august bench , one cannon - shot shattered forever . He is dead . Slavery is dying . The destiny of the country is in the hand of the Eternal Lord .
