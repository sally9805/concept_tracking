( 103 ) Dr. Huger 's Intention . DR . HUGER was thirty years old when he deliberately resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " fall in love " of anything so matter-of-fact and well-considered . He made up his mind that marriage was a good thing ,  --  that he was old enough to marry ,  --  finally , that he would marry . Then he decided , with equal deliberation , on the qualifications necessary in the lady , and began to look about him to find her . She must be a blonde . Above all things else , he must have her gentle and trustful ; and he believed that gentleness and trustfulness inhered in the blue-eyed , fair-haired type of womanhood . She must be appreciative , but not strong-minded ,  --  well-bred , with a certain lady-like perfectness , which could not be criticised , and yet which would always save her from being conspicuous . Not for the world would he have any new-fangled woman's-rights notions about her . You might fancy it would be a somewhat difficult matter for him to find precisely the realization of this ideal ; but here fate befriended him ,  --  fate , who seemed to have taken Dr. Huger under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his life . He looked out of his window , after he had come to the resolution heretofore recorded , and saw Amy Minturn tripping across the village green . Amy was eighteen ,  --  blonde , blue-eyed , innocent , well-bred , unpresuming , without ambition , and without originality . She was very lovely in her own quiet , tea-rose style . Her position was satisfactory ; for her father , Judge Minturn , was a man of mark in Windham , and one of Dr. Huger 's warmest friends . So , having decided that here was an embodiment of all his " must-haves , " the doctor went over that evening to call at the Minturn mansion . Not that the call in itself was an unusual occurrence . He went there often ; but hitherto his conversation had been principally directed to the judge , and to-night there was a noticeable change . Amy was looking her loveliest , in her diaphanous muslin robes , with blue ribbons at her throat , and in her soft light hair . Dr. Huger wondered that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep lustrous blue of her eyes , the dainty , flower-like grace of her words and ways . He talked to her , and watched the changing color in her cheeks , and her rippling smiles , until he began to think the falling in love , to which he had so deliberately addressed himself , the easiest and pleasantest thing in the world . She had the prettiest little air of propriety ,  --  half prudish , and half coquettish . She received his attentions with a shy grace that was irresistibly tempting . He went often to Judge Minturn 's after that  --  not too often , for he did not wish to startle his pretty Amy by attentions too sudden or too overpowering ; and , indeed , there was nothing in the gentle attraction by which she drew him to hurry him into any insane forgetfulness of his customary moderation . But he liked and approved her more and more . He made up his mind to give her a little longer time in which to become familiar with him , and then to ask her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determination , he was sent for , one August day , to see a new patient ,  --  a certain Miss Colchester . He was thinking about Amy as he went along ,  --  laughing at the foolish old notion concerning the course of true love ; for what could run any smoother , he asked himself , than his had ? It seemed to him as simple and pretty as an idyl ,  --  the " Miller 's Daughter " New Englandized . " Oh , that I were beside her now ! Oh , will she answer if I call ? Oh , would she give me vow for vow ,  --  Sweet Amy ,  --  if I told her all ? " he hummed , half unconsciously , as he walked on . Soon he came in sight of Rock Cottage , the place to which he was going , and began thereupon to speculate about Miss Colchester . Of course she was one of the summer boarders of whom Rock Cottage was full . He wondered whether she were young or old ,  --  whether he should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ;  --  and by this time , he had rung the bell , and was inquiring for her of the tidy girl who answered his summons . He was shown into a little parlor on the first floor , and , pausing a moment at the door , he looked at his patient . A very beautiful woman , he said to himself , but just such an one as he did not like . She sat in a low chair , her back to the window and her face turned toward him . She wore a simple white-cambric wrapper . Her beauty had no external adornment whatever . It shone upon him startlingly and unexpectedly , as if you should open a closet , where you were prepared to find an old family portrait of some stiff Puritan grandmother , and be confronted , instead , by one of Murillo 's Spanish women , passionate and splendid . For Miss Colchester was not unlike those Murillo-painted beauties . She had a clear , dark skin , through which the changeful color glowed as if her cheeks were transparent ; dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slumbrous eyes ; proud , straight features . There was nothing like a New-England woman about her . That was Dr. Huger 's first thought ; and she read it , either through some subtle clairvoyant power , or , a simpler solution , because she knew that every one , who saw her under these cool skies of the temperate zone , would naturally think that thought first . Her full , ripe lips parted in a singular smile , as she said ,  --  " You are thinking that I am not of the North . You are right . I was born in New Orleans . I am a Creole of the Creoles . I do n't like the people here . I sent for you because you were German , at least by descent . " " How did you know it ? " It was an abrupt question for a man of the doctor 's habitual grave courtesy ; but she seemed to him unique , and it was impossible to maintain his old equipoise in her presence . She had read his thought like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How did I know you were German ? " She smiled . " Because your name suggested the idea , and then I saw you in the street , and your features indorsed the hint your name had given me . " " I am glad that anything should have made you think of me . " It was one of the conventional platitudes , of which self-complacent men , like Dr. Huger , keep a stock on hand for their lady friends . Miss Colchester saw its poverty , and smiled at it , as she answered him ,  --  " I think of every one with whom I come in contact ; and I thought of you , especially , because I intended from the first , if there were a good physician here , to consult him . " The doctor looked into her radiant face . " Is it possible that you are ill ? " He had sat down beside her by this time , and taken her hand . It gave him a curious sensation as it lay quietly in his . He felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it than in any hand he had ever touched . " That you must tell me , " she said , quietly . " My heart feels strangely , sometimes ; it beats too rapidly , I think , and sometimes very irregularly . I have lived too fast ,  --  suffered and enjoyed too keenly . The poor machine is worn out , perhaps . I look to you to inform me whether I am in danger . " " I must have my stethoscope . I will go for it . Are you sure you can bear the truth ? " She smiled ,  --  a cool smile touched with scorn . " I have not found life so sweet , " she said , " that its loss will trouble me . I only want to know how long I am likely to have in which to do certain things . If you can tell me , I shall be satisfied . " As Dr. Huger went home , he met Amy . Something in the sight of her fresh , blonde beauty , with its fulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bowed to her with a preoccupied air , and hurried on . When he went back to Rock Cottage , Miss Colchester was sitting just as he had left her . To sit long at a time in one motionless attitude was a peculiarity of hers . Her manner had always a singular composure , though her nature was impetuous . He placed over her heart the instrument he had brought , then listened a long time to its beating . He dreaded to tell her the story it revealed to him , and at last made up his mind to evade the responsibility . When he had come to this conclusion , he raised his head . " I do not feel willing , " he said , " to pronounce an opinion . Let me send for a medical man who is older , who has had more experience . " She raised her dark eyes , and looked full in his face . " You are afraid to tell me , after all I said ? Will you not believe that I do not care to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for the truth from your lips . You find my heart greatly enlarged ? " " I told you I did not like to trust my own judgment ; but that is my opinion . " " And if you are right I shall be likely to live  --  how long ? " " Possibly for years . Probably for a few months . There is no help ,  --  I mean , no cure . If you suffer much pain , that can be eased , perhaps . " Miss Colchester was silent a few moments . Dr. Huger could see no change in her face , though he watched her closely . The color neither left her cheeks or deepened in them . He did not see so much as an eyelash quiver . At last she spoke ,  --  " You have been truly kind , and I thank you . I believe I am glad of your tidings . I think I shall stay here in Windham till the last . I would like one autumn among these grand old woods and hills . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I have to do by letter , and my most faithful friend on earth is my quadroon maid who is here with me . She will be my nurse , if I need nursing . And you will be my physician ,  --  will you not ? " " I will when I can help you . At other times , may I not be your friend , and as such come to see you as often as I can ? " " Just as often ,  --  the oftener the better , " she answered , with that smile which thrilled him so strangely every time he met it . " I shall always be glad to see you . Your visits will be a real charity ; for , except Lisette , I am quite solitary . " He understood by her manner that it was time to go , and took his leave . That night he walked over to Judge Minturn 's . Amy was just as pretty as ever ,  --  just as graceful and gentle and faultless in dress and manner . Why was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretofore ? Had the salt lost its savor ? His judgment endorsed her as it always had . She was precisely the kind of woman to make a man happy . That pure blonde beauty , with its tints of pearl and pink , was just what he wanted , always had wanted . Why was it that he was haunted all the time by eyes so different from those calm blue orbs of Amy 's ? He thought it was because his new patient 's case had interested him so much in a medical point of view . He was tired , and he made it an excuse for shortening his call . He went home to sit and smoke and speculate again about Miss Colchester . He seemed to see her wonderful exotic face through the blue smoke-wreaths . Her words and ways came back to him . He had discovered so soon that she was no gentle , yielding creature . She had power enough to make her conspicuous anywhere  --  piquant moods and manners of her own , which a man could find it hard to tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  that such office had not fallen to his share ,  --  that the woman he had resolved to marry was so unlike her ; yet he could not banish the imperious face which haunted his fancy . The next day found him again at Rock Cottage ; but he waited until afternoon , when all his other visits had been made . It was a warm day ; and Miss Colchester was again in white , but in full fleecy robes , whose effect was very different from the simple cambric wrapper she had worn the day before . Ornaments of barbaric gold were in her ears , at her throat , and manacled her wrists . A single scarlet lily drooped low in her hair . She looked full of life ,  --  strong , passionate , magnetic life . Was it possible that he had judged her case aright ? Could death come to spoil this wonderful beauty in its prime ? Their talk was not like that of physician and patient . It touched on many themes , and she illuminated each one with the quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in the two hours he spent with her ; but her history ,  --  who she was ,  --  whence she came ,  --  why she was at Windham ,  --  remained as mysterious as before . Her maid came in once or twice , and called her " Miss Pauline , " and this one item of her first name was all that he knew about her more than he had discovered yesterday . He saw her ,  --  a woman utterly different from the gentle , communicative , impressible , blue-eyed ideal he had always cherished ,  --  a woman with whom , had she been in her full health , his reason would have pronounced it madness to fall in love . How much more would it be madness now , when he knew that she was going straight to her doom ,  --  that when the summer came again , it would shine upon her grave ! And yet it seemed as if the very hopelessness of any passion for her made her power over him more fatal . He went to see her day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he did not think about her at all . She was no more to him in those days than last year 's roses , which had smelled so sweet to him in their prime . He was absorbed in Pauline Colchester  --  lived in her life . She accepted his devotion , simply because she did not understand it . If she had been in health , she would have known that this man loved her ; but the knowledge of her coming fate must make all that impossible , she thought . So she accepted his friendship with a feeling of entire security ; and , though she revealed to him no facts of her material life , admitted him to such close intimacy with her heart and soul as , under other circumstances , he might never have reached in a lifetime of acquaintance . And the nearer he drew to her the more insanely he loved her ,  --  loved her , though he knew the fate which waited for her , the heart-break he was preparing for himself . At last he told her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in spite of himself it came to his lips . In September it was ,  --  one of those glorious autumn days when the year seems at flood-tide , full of a ripe glory , which thrills an imaginative temperament as does no tender verdure of spring , no bravery of summer . Pauline Colchester , sensitive to all such influences as few are , was electrified by it . Dr. Huger had never seen her so radiant , so full of vitality . It seemed to him impossible that she should die . If he had her for his own ,  --  if he could make her happy ,  --  could he not guard her from every shock or excitement , and keep her in such a charmed atmosphere of peace that the worn-out heart might last for many a year ? It was the idlest of lover 's dreams , the emptiest and most baseless of hopes , which he would have called any other man insane for cherishing . But he grasped at it eagerly , and , before he knew what he was doing , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colchester . " Is it possible , " she said , after a silent space , " that you could have loved me so well ? That you would have absorbed into your own the poor remnant of my life , and cherished it to the end ? I ought to be sorry for your sake ; but how can I , when just such a love is what I have starved for all my life ? I have no right to it now . I am Mrs. , not Miss , Colchester . I was Pauline Angereau before Ralph Colchester found me and married me . I had money and , I suppose , beauty ; perhaps he coveted them both . He made me believe that he loved me with all his heart ; and then , when I was once his wife , he began torturing me to death with his neglect and his cruelty . He was a bad man ; and I do n't believe there is a woman on earth strong enough to have saved him from himself . I bore everything , for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killing me , and , in one of his frequent absences , I came away to die in peace . When it is all over , Lisette will write to him . He will have the fortune he longed for , without the encumbrance of which he tired so soon . You must not see me any more . Bound as I am , feeling what you feel , there would be sin in our meeting . And yet I shall die easier for knowing that , once in my life , I have been loved for myself alone . " Then Dr. Huger rose to go . To-morrow , perhaps he could combat those scruples of hers ; but to-day , there was no more to be said to this woman whom another man owned . To-morrow , he could tell better how nearly he could return to the quiet ways of friendship ,  --  whether it would be possible for him to tend her , brother-like , to the last , as he had meant to do before he loved her . He took her hand a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so hard to make quiet that it almost sounded cold ,  --  " I must go now . I dare not stay and talk to you . I will come again to-morrow . " " Yes , to-morrow . " Her face kindled , as she spoke , with a strange light as of prophecy . What " to-morrow " meant to her he did not know . He turned away suddenly , for his heart was sore ; and , as he went , he heard her say , speaking very low and tenderly ,  --  " God bless you , Francis Huger . " The next day he went again to Rock Cottage . He had fought his battle and conquered . He thought now that he could stay by her to the end , and speak no word , look no look , which should wrong her honor or his own . He asked for her at the door as usual ; and they told him she had paid her bill that morning , and left . She had come , they said , no one knew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had left no messages and given no address . Dr. Huger understood that this was something she had meant to keep secret from him of all others . Was he never to see her again ? When she had said , " Yes , to-morrow , " could she have meant the long to-morrow , when the night of death should be over ? He turned away , making no sign of disappointment ,  --  his sorrow dumb in his heart ; and , as he went , her voice seemed again to follow him ,  --  " God bless you , Francis Huger . " For two months afterward , he went the round of his daily duties in a strange , absent , divided fashion . He neither forgot nor omitted anything ; yet he saw as one who saw not , and heard with a hearing which conveyed to his inward sense no impression . She was with him everywhere . All the time , he was living over the brief four weeks of their acquaintance , in which , it seemed to him , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his lifetime . Every day , every hour , he expected some message from her . He felt a sort of conviction that she would not die until he had seen her again . He thought , at last , that his summons to her side had come . name=f651-027Page image - Page 118 . He opened , one day , a letter directed in a hand with which he was not familiar . He read in it , with hurrying pulses , only these words :  --  Letter " Madame Pauline Angereau Colchester is dead . I obey her wish in sending you these tidings . " Lisette . " Section From the letter had dropped , as he unfolded it , a long silky tress of dark hair . He picked it up , and it seemed to cling caressingly to his fingers . It was all he could ever have in this world of Pauline Colchester . Her " to-morrow " had come . His would come , too , by-and-by . What then ? God alone knew whether his soul would ever find hers , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day to Amy Minturn ? Who can tell ? Men have done such things . It will depend on how weary the solitary way shall seem ,  --  how much he may long for his own fireside . At any rate , he will never tell her the story of Pauline . Back matter
