CONTINENTAL MONTHLY : DEVOTED TO LITERATURE AND NATIONAL POLICY . VOL . TI-NOVEMBER , 1862. - No . V. THE CAUSES OF THE REBELLION . No other nation was ever convulsed by an internal struggle so tremendous as that which now rends our own unhappy country . No mere rebellion has ever before spread its calamitous effects so widely , beyond the scene of its immediate horrors . Just in proportiq* to the magnitude of the evils it his proc duced , is the enormity of the crime Involved , on one side or the other ; and good men may well feel solicitous to know where rests the burden of this awful responsibility . The long train of preparatory events preceding the outbreak , and the extra- ordinary acts by which the conspirators signalized its commencement , point , with sufficient certainty , to the incendiaries w*o produced the vast conflagration , and who appear to be respo*sible forthe ruin which has ensued . But it remains to inquire by what means the great mass of inflammable materials was accumulated and made ready to take fire at th' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fatal act , or what palliation of the guilt which est upon them . The reputatio e American people , and of the free government which is their pride and glory , must suffer in the estimation of mankind , unless they can be fairly acquitted of all responsibility for the civil war , which not only desolates large portions of our own country , but seriously interferes with the prosperity of multitudinous classes , and the stability of large industrial interests , in other lands . Neither in the physical nor in the moral world , can the effects of any phenomenon go beyond the nature and extent of its causes . Mighty convulsions , like that which now shakes this continent , must have their roots in far distant times , and must gather their nutriment of passion and violence from a wide field of sympathetic opinion . No influence of mere individuals , no sudden acts of government even , no temporary causes of any nature whatsoever , are adequate to produce results so wides*4ead and astounding . The social forces which contend in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering their strength for years , in order tp exhibit the gigantic deathstruggle in which they are now engaged . Gen. Jackson , after having crushed the incipient rebellion of 1832 , wrote , in a private letter , recently published , that the next attempt to overthrow the Union would be instigated by the same 4 // party , but based upon the question of see , Missouri , and North Carolina were slavery , divided on the question . Mr. Calhoun qwq tamed , and , in the end , strengthened ; the fatal element of discord would scarcely have survived to work and plot in secret for more than a quarter of a century . It is true , slavery would have remained ; but in the absence of other causes , slavery would not necessarily have brought the country to the present crisis . Providence may have so ordered the events of that day as to leave the revolutionary element in existence , in order that it might eventually fasten upon slavery as the instrument of its treason , and thus bring this system , condemned alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind , to that complete eventual destruction , which seems to be inevitably approach* ng . The idea of an independent Southern confederacy , to be constituted of a fragment of the Union , survived the contest of 1832 , and has been*che*rished with zeal and enthusiasm , by a small party of malcontents , from that day to this . Either from honest conviction or from the syren seductions of ambition , or perhaps from that combination of both which so often misleads the judgment of the wisest and best of men , this party has pursued its end with unrivalled zeal and consummate tact , never for a single moment abating it efforts to convince the South of the advantages of separation . But all its ability and all its untiring labors failed to make any serious impression , until the great and powerful interest tf slavery was enlisted in the cause , 4nd : used *s the means of reaching th' feelings , and arousing the prejudices of the Souther* people . The theories of nullification and secession , while accepted by many leadc ing n*iinds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of th " e people . Indeed , it may be said with truth , th' * ? ke honest instincts of the peopl0 invariably rejected these pernicioiis and dangerous theories , whenever they were distinctly involved in the elections . Nevertheless , there was an undercurrent of opinion in favor of them : the minds of the people were familiarized with the doctrines , and thus made ready to embrace them , whenever they should be satisfied it was indispensable to their safety and liberty to avail themselves of their benefit . These abstract principles , however industriously and successfully taught , would not of themselves have availed to urge the people on to the desperate contest into which they have been madly precipitated . The dogma of the right of secession was not left a mere barren idea : it was accompanied with constant teachings respecting the incompatibility of interests , and the inevitable conflict , between the North and the South ; the superiority of slavery over every other form of labor ; and the imminent danger of the overthrow of this benign institution by Northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial policy of that section . Thus , the mischievous error of secession was roused to life and action by the exhibition of those unreal phantoms , so often conjured up to frighten the South-abolition , abrarianism , and protective oppression . All these deceptive ideas were required to be infused into the minds of the people , in order to prepare the way for rebellious action . The right of secession was an indispensable condition , without which there could be no justification for the violent measures to be adopted . No considerable number of American citizens could be found ready to lay treasonable hands upon their government ; but a great step would be taken if they could be convinced that the cons*tution provi4ed for its own abrogation , and that the act of destruction could at any time be legally and regularly accomplished . The absolute humanity , justice , and morality of slavery , its excellence as a social institution , and its efilciency in maintaining order and insuring progress , must be fully established and universally admitted , in // order to enlist the powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And finally , it was necessary to show that the divine institution was in danger , that the free labor of the North was actively hostile to it and planning its ruin , and that this hostility was to be aided by all the selfish desires of the protectionists and the dangerous violence of the agrarian mudsills ' of the other section . It was not of the least importance that these statements or any of them should be true . Let them be thoroughly believed by the people , and that conviction would answer all the purposes of the conspirators . Accordingly , for more than a quarter of a century ; these heresies and falsehoods were most industriously instilled into the minds of the Southern people , of whom the great mass are unfortunately , and , from their peculiar condition , necessarily , kept in that state of ignorance which would favor the reception of such incredible and monstrous fallacies . The argument as to the right of secession has been exhausted ; and if it had not been , it does not come within the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enemies of the United States , foreign and domestic , will continue to believe , or at least to profess to believe and try to convince themselves , that the Coastitution of 1787 , which superseded the Confederation , contained all the defects of the latter which it was specially designed to remedy ,  --  that the league of the preceding period was prolonged in the succeeding organization , only to be the fatal object of future discontent and ambition . Certainly this doctrine is the basis of the rebellion , and without it no successful movement could have been made to secure cooperation from any of the States . Nevertheless , it can not be considered one of the impelling causes which moved the rebellious States to action , for it is not of itself an active principle . It rather served to smooth the way , by removing obstacles which opposed the operation of real motives . Yeneration for the work of the fathers of the republic , respect for the Constitution and love of the Union , as things of infinite value , worthy to be cherished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compassed the destruction of the government . It was necessary to remove this obstacle , and to eradicate these patriotic sentiments , which had taken strong hold of the minds and hearts of the people of both sections . For more than two generations the Union had been held sacred , beyond all other earthly blessings . It was an object of the first magnitude to unsettle this long-cherished sentiment . The conspirators were altogether too shrewd and full of tact to approach their object directly . They adopted the artifice of arousing and studiously cultivating another sentiment of equal strength , which should spring up side by side with their Jove of the Union , flourish for a time in friendly co*peration with it , but ultimately supplant and entirely supersede it . This was the plausible and attractive sentiment of State pride , concealing in itself the idea of perfect sovereignty , with the right of nullification and secession . With consummate ability , with untiring industry and perseverance , and without a moment 's cessation for more than a quarter of a century , this fruitful but pernicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as there was no occasion to put the theory into practice , there seemed to be no ground for alarm . The question was one rather of curious subtlety than of practical importance . Meanwhile , the minds of men became familiar with the thought ; they entertained it without aversion ; the germs of ultimate discord and dissolution silently took root , and slowly grew up in the undem*standings of men . Not that the princt*le was adopted ; it was rather tolerated than accepted . But this was the very thing intended by the wily conspirators . They expected nothing better ; for they knew well that an accident or a bold precipi // tation of events would cause the popular mind to seize this principle and use it , as the only justification for revolutionary violence . Thus this doctrine , which is the embodiment of anarchy , was carefully prepared for the occasion , and artfully placed within easy mental reach of those who would be called upon to wield it . Paripasszt with the dissemination and growth of this dangerous opinion , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steadily held in view , by restricting and embarrassing the action of the Federal Government in every possible way . Notwithstanding the distrust and aversion of the Jackson party against them , continued long after the events of 1832 , they succeeded in forming , first a coalition , and finally a thorough union with the great popular organization  --  the democratic party . Uoldincr the balance of power between that party and their opponents , they dictated terms to the successive democratic conventions , and , in effect , controlled their nominations and their policy . They imposed upon that party the formidable dogma of a strict construction of the Constitution , ' and under that plausible pretext , denied to the Government the exercise of every useful power necessary to make it strong and efficient within the limits of its legitimate functions . Their evident object , though cautiously and successfully concealed , was to weaken the Federal Government , and build up the power of the separate States , so that the former , shorn of its constitutional vigor , and crippled in its proper field of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy prey to their iniquitous designs . The navigation of the great Mississippi river , the imperial highway of the continent , could not be improved , because every impediment taken away , and every facility given to commerce on its bosom , were so much strength added to the bonds of the Union . The harbors of the great lakes and of the Atlantic coast could not be rendered secure by the agency of the Federal Government , because every beneficent act of this nature fixed it more firmly in the affections of the people , and gave it additional influence at home and abroad . The great Pacific railroad  --  a measure of infinite importance to the unity of the nation , to the development of the country , and to the general prosperity , as well as to the public defence  --  a work so grand in its proportions , and so universal in its ben* efits , that only the power of a great nation was equal to its accomplishment or capable and worthy of its proper control-this great and indispensable measure was defeated from year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to oppose it , and was only passed in the end , after they had launched the rebellion , and made their open attack against the Government , which they had so long sought to embarrass and weaken , in view of this very contingency . While yielding these principles in theory , the democratic party did not always adhere to them in practice . The instinct of patriotism was often stronger than the obligations of party necessity and party policy . Moreover , the text of these doctrines in the democratic creed was frequently a subject of grave dispute in the party , and unanimity never prevailed in regard to it . Yet the subtle poison infused into the body of the organization , extended its baleful influence to all questions , and too often paralyzed the arm of the Government in every field of its appropriate action . Never was presented in history a better illustration of the effect of false and mischievous ideas . It would be unjust , because it would be untrue , to suspect the democratic party of any clear knowledge of the ends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any participation in the treasonable purpose . Many members of that party saw the danger in time , and abandoned the organization before it was caught in the meshes of the great conspiracy . Some , however , even in the loyal States , clung // to Breckinridge and the fatal abstractions of the party creed , until these reached their final and legitimate culmination , in the ghastly paralysis of the most indispensable functions of the Government-the ruinous abuegation of all power of self-defence  --  the treacherous attempt at national suicide only failing for want of courage to perpetrate the supreme act , which was exhibited by the administration of James Buchanan , in its last hours , when it proclaimed the doctrine of secession to be - anfounded in constitutional right , and yet denied the power of the Government to prevent its own destruction . The threats of an imperious band of traitors , operating upon the fears of a weak old man , who was already implicated in the treason , drove him to the verge of the abyss into which he was willing to plunge his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drew back , dismayed at the thought of sacrificing himself . The doctrine of secession , long and laboriously taught , and the cognate principles calculated to diminish the power of the Federal Government and magnify that of the States , thus served to smooth the way , to lay the track , upon which the engine of rebellion was to be started . But there was still wanting the motive power which should impel the machine and give it energy and momentum . Something tangible was required - something palpable to the masses-on the basis of which violent antagonisms and hatreds could be engendered , and fearful dangers could be pictured to the popular imagination . The protective system , loudly denounced as unequal and oppressive , as well as unconstitutional , had proved wholly insufficient to arouse rebellion in 1832 . It would have proved equally so in 1861 : but then the ultra free trade tariff of 1856 was still in existence ; and it continued in force , until , to increase dissatisfaction , and invite the very system which they pretended to oppose and deplore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iMiorrill Tariff , ' deliberately stepped aside , and suffered it to become a law . But this was merely a piece of preliminary strategy intended to give them some advantage in the great battle which was eventually to be fought on other fields . It might throw some additional weight into their scale ; it might give them some plausible ground for hypocritical complaint ; and might even , to some extent , serve to hide the real ground of their movement ; yet , of itself , it could never be decisive of anything . It could neither justify revolution in point of morals , nor could it blind the people of the South to the terrible calamities which the experiment of secession was destined to bring upon them . Slavery alone , with the vast material prosperity apparently created by it , with the debatable and exciting questions , moral , political , and social , which arise out of it , and with the palpable dangers , which , in spite of every effort to deny it , plainly brood over the system-slavery alone had the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent to its foundations . In the present crisis of the struggle , it would be a waste of time and of thought to attempt to trace back to its origin the long current of excitement on the slavery question , beginning in 1834 , and swelling in magnitude until the present day ; or to seek to fix the responsibility for the various events which marked its progress , from the earliest agitation down to the great rebellion , which is evidently the consummation and the end of it all . The only lesson important to be learned , and that which is the sum of all these great events , plainly taught by the history of this generation , and destined to characterize it in all future time , is , that slavery had in itself the germs of this profound agitation , and that , for thirty years , it stirred the moral and political elements of this nation as no other cause had power to do . It is of little consequence , for the purpose in view , to inquire what antagonisms struggled with slavery in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space , and so long a period of time . All ideas and all interests were involved . Moral , social , political , and economical considerations clashed and antagonized in the gigantic conflict . Is slavery right or wrong ? Has it the sanction of enlightened conscience , or of the divine law as revealed in the Old and New Testaments ? The last words of this moral contest have scarcely yet ceased to reverberate in our ears , even while the sound of cannon tells of other arguments and another arbitrament , which must soon cut short all the jargon of the logicians . But one of the most remarkable features of the whole case , has been the indignation with which the slave interest , from beginning to end , has resisted the discussion of these moral questions . As if such inquiries could , by any possibility , be prevented ! As if a system , good and right in itself , defensible in the light of sound reason , could suffer by the fullest examination which could be made in private or in public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of mere moral means ! The discussions , the agitations , and all the fierce passions which attended them , were unavoidable . Human nature must be changed and wholly revolutionized before such agitations can be suppressed . They are the means appointed by the Creator for the progress of humanity . The seeds of them are planted in the heart of man , and , in the sunshine and air of freedom , they must germinate and grow , and eventually produce such fruit as the eternal laws of God have made necessary from the beginning . The social question shaped itself amidst the turbulent elements , and came out clear and well defined , in the perfect contrast and antagonism of the two sectional systems . Free labor , educated , skilful , prosperous , self-poised , and independent , grew into great strength , and accumulated untold wealth , in all the States in which slavery had been supplanted . Unexampled and prodigious inventive energy had multiplied the physical power of men by millions , and these wonderful creations of wealth and power seemed destined to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this system of free labor prevailed . Immigration , attracted by this boundless prosperity , flowed in with a steady stream , and an overflowing population was fast spreading the freedom and prosperity of the Northern States to all the uncultivated regions of the Union . On the other hand , by a sort of social repulsion  --  a sort of polarity which intensifies opposition and repugnance-the theory of slavery was carried to an extreme never before known in the history of mankind . Capital claimed to own labor , as the best relation in which the two could be placed toward each other . The masses of men , compelled to spend their lives in physical toil , were held to be properly kept in ignorance , under the guidance of intelligent masters . The skilful control of the master , when applied to slaves , was held to be superior in its results to the self-regulating energies of educated men , laboring for their own benefit , and impelled by the powerful motives of self-interest and independent enterprise . The safety of society demanded the subordination of the laboring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representative system prevails , was it necessary that working men should be held in subjection . Slavery , therefore , was not only justifiable ; it was the only possible condition on which free society could be organized , and liberal institutions maintained . This was the corner stone ' of the new confederacy . The opposite system in the free States , at the first touch of internal trouble and civil war , would prove the truth of the new theory by bread riots and agrarian overthrow of property and of all other institutions held sacred in the true conditions of social order . Such was the monstrous inversion of social phenomena which the Southern mind accepted atthe hands of their leadingmen , and conceived to be possible in this advanced // age of the world . Seizing upon a system compatible only with the earliest steps in the progress of man , and suitable only to the moral sentiments and unenlightened ideas of the most backward races of the world , they undertook to naturalize and establish it-nay , to perpetuate it , and to build up society on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the freest and most enlightened nations ! Evidently , this was a monstrous perversion of intellect - a blindness and madness scarcely finding a parallel in history . It was expected , too , that this anomalous social proceeding-this backward march of civilization on this continent-would excite no animadversion and arouse no antagonism in the opposite section . It involved the reopening of the slave trade , and it was expected that foreign nations would abate their opposition , lower their flags , and suffer the new empire , founded on the corner stone of slavery , ' to march forward in triumph and achieve its splendid destiny . These moral and social ideas might have had greater scope to work out their natural results , had not the political connections between the North and the South implicated the two sections , alike , in the consequences of any error or folly on the part of either . Taxation and representation , and the surrender of fugitive slaves , all provided for in the Constitution , were the points in which the opposite polities came into contact in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily arose . But it was chiefly on the question of territorial extension , and in the formation of new States , that the most inveterate of all the contests were engendered . The constitutional provisions applicable to these questions are not without some obscurity , and this afforded a plausible opportunity for all the impracticable subtleties arising out of the doctrine of strict construction . From the time of the admission of Missouri , in 1820 , down to the recent controversy about Kansas , the territorial question was unsettled , and never failed to be the cause of terrible agitation . But the march of events soon superseded the question ; and even while the contest was fiercest and most bitter , the silent operation of general causes was sweeping away the whole ground of dispute . The growth of population in the Northern States was so unexampled , and so far exceeded that of the Southern States , that there could be no actual rivalry in the settlement of the territories . The latter already had more territory than they could possibly occupy and people . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of the new territories and filling them with industry and prosperity , slavery was repelling white emigration , and the South , from sheer want of men , was wholly unable to meet the competition . Yet , with most unreasonable clamors , intended only to arouse the passions of the ignorant , Southern statesmen insisted on establishing the law of slavery where they could not plant the institution itself . They finally demanded that slavery should be recognized everywhere within the national domain ; and that the Federal power should be pledged for its protection , even against the votes of the majority of the people . This was nothing less than an attempt to check the growth of the country , by the exclusion of free States , when it was impossible to increase it by the addition of any others . Upon the failure of this monstrous demand , civil war was to be inaugurated ! A power which had been relatively dwindling and diminishing from the beginning-which , in the very nature of things , could not maintain its equality in numbers and in constitutional weight-this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth , and in all its policy , and , in the event of refusal , threatened to rend and destroy it . Such pretensions could not have been made with sincerity . They were but the sinister means of exciting sectional enmities , and preparing for the // final measures of the great conspiracy . Having discnrded the rational and humane views of their own fathers-Washington , Jefferson , Madison , and othersit was but the natural sequel that they should signalize their degeneracy by aiming to overthrow the work in which those sages had embodied their generous ideas  --  the Constitution of the United States and the whole fabric of government resting upon it . In what manner these mischievous absurdities . became acceptable to the Southern people-by what psychological miracle so great a transformation was accomplished in so short a time-is only to be explained by examining some of the delusions which blinded the authors of the rebellion , and enabled them to mislead the masses who confided too implicitly in the leadership . of their masters . Weak as were the Southern people in point of numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section , the haughty slaveholders easily persuaded themselves and their dependents that they could successfully cope in arms with the Northern adversary , whom they aft'ected to despise for his cowardly and mercenary disposition . Wealth , education , and ample leisure gave them the best opportunity for political studies and public employments . Long experience imparted skill in all the arts of government , and enabled them , by superior ability , to control the successive administrations at Washington . Proud and confident , they indulged the belief that their great political prestige would continue to serve them among their late party associates in the North , and that the counsels of the adversary would be distracted , and his power weakened , by the fatal effects of dissension . All warlike sentiment and capacity was believed to be extinct among the traders and manufacturers , the shopkeepers and p*dlars , ' of the Middle and Eastern States . Hence a vigorous attack in arms against the Federal Government was expected to be met with no energetic and effective resistance . A peaceable dissolution of the Union , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cardinal point in the teachings of the secessionists . The fraudulent as well as violent measures by which they sought to disarm the Federal Government and to forestall its action , were only adopted to make assurance doubly sure . ' Beyond all doubt , the system of slavery encourages those habits and passions which make the soldier , and which instigate and maintain wars . The military spirit and that of slavery are congenial ; for both belong to an early stage in the progress of civilization , when each is necessary to the support and continuance of the other . It was therefore to be expected that the Southern people would be better prepared for the organization , and also for the maneuvring of armies . But the mistake and the fatal delusioji cherisjmd by the conspirators , was the belief that the Northern people were without iyanly spirit , and incapable of being aroused by sentiments of patriotism . It was an equal miscalculation to anticipate that the fabric of Northern free society would fall to pieces , and be thrown into irremediable disorder , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the offspring of the slave system , which boasted of the solidity of its own organization and the impossibility of its overthrow . From their standpoint , amid the darkness of a social organization , in which one half the population is not more than semi-civilized , the slaveholders could not easily obtain any other view . Long accustomed to wield irresponsible power as masters , enjoying wealth and independence from the unrewarded labor of the slave , but liberal and humane , condescending and indulgent , so long as the untutored black was quiet and obedient , the planter very naturally imagined his system to be the perfection of social order . In the atmosphere of luxurious ease which sur // rounded him , were the elements of a mental mirage which distorted everything in his deceptive vision , He weighed the two systems , and found his own immeasurably more powerful than its antagonist . Fatal mistake ! fatal but inevitable , in his condition , in the midst of the blinding refractions of the medium which enveloped him . Prosperity had made him giddy . Cotton was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sentiment of right , he argued , would have no influence over starving operatives ; and England and France , as well as the Eastern States of the Union , would stand aghast and yield to the masterstroke which should deprive them of the material of their labor . Millions were dependent on it in all the great centres of civilization , and the ramifications of its power extended into all ranks of society and all departments of industry and commerce . It was only necessary to wave this imperial sceptre over the nations , and all of them would fall prostrate and acknowledge the supremacy of the power which wielded it . Nothing could be more plausible than this delusion . Satan himself , when about to wage war in heaven , could not have invented one better calculated to marshal his hosts and give promise of success in rebellion against the authority of the Most High . But alas ! the supreme error of this anticipation lay in omitting from the calculation all power of principle . The right still has authority over the minds of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ din ; men and women may be thrown out of employment ; the marts of commerce may be silent and deserted ; but truth and justice still command some respect among men , and God yet remains the object of their adoration . Drunk with power and dazzled with prosperity , monopolizing cotton , and raIsing it to the influence of a veritable fetich , the authors of the rebellion did not admit a doubt of the success of their attack on the Federal Government . They dreamed of perpetuating slavery , though all history shows the decline of the system as industry , commerce , and knowledge advance . The slaveholders proposed nothing less than to reverse the currents of humanity , and to make barbarisin flouri. h in the bosom of civilization . They even thought of extending the system , by opening the slave trade and enlarging the boundaries of their projected empire . Mexico and Central America , Cuba and St. Domingo , with the whole West Indian group of islands , awaited the consolidation of their power , and stood ready to swell the glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from their sight . At an early day after the inauguration of their government , they were compelled to disavow the design of reopening the slave trade , and in no event is it l ) robable their recognition will be yielded by foreign governments , except on the basis of ultinate emancipation . How such a proposition will be received by their deluded followers , remains yet to be ascertained by an experiment which the authors of the rebellion will be slow to try among their people . One of the most effective appeals made to the nonslaveholders of the South , in order to start the revolution , was to their fears and prejudices against the threatened equality and competition of the emancipated negro . The immense influence of this appeal can scarcely be estimated by those not intimately acquainted with the social condition of the great mass of the Southern people . Among them , the distinction of color is maintained with the utmost rigor , and the barrici ' between the two races , social and political , is held to be impassable and eternal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is esteemed a degradation from which he can never recover . Toward the enegro , as an inferior , the white man is often affable and kind , or aelty being the exception , universeily condemned and often punished ; // but toward the black man as an equal , an implacable hostility is instantly arrayed . This intense and unconquerable prejudice , it is well known , is not confined wholly to the South ; but it prevails there without dissent , and is , in fact , one of the fundamental principles of social organization . When , therefore , the leaders of the rebellion suceeded in persuading the Southern masses that the success of the Republican party would eventually liberate the slave and place him on an equality with the whites , nn irresistible impulse was given to their cause . To the extent that this charge was credited was the rebellion consolidated and embittered . Had , it been universally believed , there would have been few dissenting voices throughout the seceding States . All would have rushed headlong into the rebellion . And even now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field or in Congress , which can be distorted as looking to a similar end , must prove to be a strong stimulus in sustaining and invigorating the enemy . Happily , while the system of slavery naturally discourages education , and leaves the mass of whites comparatively uninformed , and peculiarly subject to be deceived and misled , there are yet many highly intelligent men among the non-slaveholders , and some liberal and unprejudiced ones among the slaveholders themselves . These serve to break the force of the appeals made to the ignorant , and they have had a powerful influence in maintaining the love of the Union and the true spirit of our institutions , among considerable numbers , in all parts of the South . From the foregoing views , it is plain , that only in a certain sense can slavery be pronounced the cause of the rebellion . It was not the first and original motive ; neithcr is it the sole end of the conspirators . But in another sense , it may justly be considered the cause of the war ; for without it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no actual necessity to destroy the Union for the protection of slavery and for its continued existence . Construed in any rational sense likely to be adopted , the Constitution afforded ample security-far more , indeed , than could be found under a separate confederacy . This was evident to the leaders of the rebellion , though it was their policy to conceal the truth from the people , by the fierce passions artfully aroused in the beginning . Slavery could not have been perpetuated , because its permanence is against the decrees of nature . But it could have lived out a peaceful and perhaps a prosperous existence , gradually disappearing without convulsion or bloodshed . Discussion and agitation could not have been prevented , nor could the inevitable end have been averted . Yet the whole movement could well have been controlled and directed , by the adoption of wise and well-considered measures , not inconsistent with the natural laws governing the case , whose final operation it was wholly impossible to prevent . But this system of gradual arnelioration , and peaceful development of ends that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They saw their last opportunity for a successful rebellion , and they determined not to let it pass uniniproved . The vast power of the slave interest ; the passions easily to be excited by it ; the encouraging delusions clustering around it ; and the fearful apprehensions growing out of its darker aspects , all contributed to make it the very instrument for accomplishing the long-cherished design . Slavery has been the chief means of bringing about the rebellion . It is the lever , resting upon the fulcrum of State sovereignty , by which the conspirators have been able , temporarily , to force one section of the Union from its legitimate connections . Thus used for this unhallowed purpose , and become tainted with treason and crimsoned with the blood of slaughtered citizens , slavery necessarily subjects itself to all the fearful contingencies and responsibilities of the rebellion . Whether the confederate // cause shall succeed or fail , the slave institution , thus fatally involved in it , can not long survive . In either event , its doom is fixed . Like one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , extinguish their own lives in inflicting a mortal wound upon their victims , slavery , roused to the final paroxysm of its hate and rage , injects all its venom into the veins of the Union , exhausts itself in the effort , and inevitably dies .
