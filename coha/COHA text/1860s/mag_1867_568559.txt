ChILDREN learn the language of their parents easily and spontaneously , not because they are children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a later period , but chiefly because the meaning of words is revealed to them by circumstances . Thus , the mother says to an older child , " shut the door . " The little one , with eyes and ears wide open , hears the direction and sees the act performed . So of learning a foreign language among a people who speak it . When , however , the business of teaching , or rather of learning a language , is transferred from the family to the school , it is obvious that these great natural advantages for its acquisition must be in a measure lost . Comparatively few of the thousand // objects which fill a house , and daily come under the notice of the child , can be brought into the school-room , and if they were , they would be out of their relations to use . Where , then , as in the case of those born deaf , the child must be removed from the family to the school , to learn language , the endeavor should be to find a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one which approaches nearest to home life , which can most successfully create or reproduce those circumstances on which the meaning of words depends . Let us submit to this test , the various methods which at different times have been proposed or have been in use for imparting a knowledge of language to the deaf and dumb . These are , 1st . Articulation ; 2d . Dactylology , or finger-spelling ; 3d . Writing ; 4th . Signs and descriptive action , in conjunction with writing and spelling . We will take the deaf child to a school where he shall be taught articulation , and reading from the lips , where all signs , spelling , writing , and illustrative action , whether of the countenance or body , as means of instruction , are excluded . His powers of utterance , we will suppose , are first tried on the word cat . After days , it may be , of patient labor on the part of teacher and pupil , the task is accomplished . The word can be distinctly uttered , and can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the teacher . But in all this time , what has been done towards imparting to the child the meaning of this word ? Nothing , absolutely nothing . If a cat had been brought into the school-room , if the picture of a cat had been shown , if a sign suggesting the object had been made , the name and the object might have been associated . But when all these means of indication are withheld , it is in the nature of things an impossibility that a meaning should be given to words so taught . They might be repeated till doomsday , and not the slightest hint of their purport would be suggested . And if no single word can have its meaning revealed by simply uttering it , much more hopeless would be the attempt to make manifest the meaning of whole sentences , by merely uttering the words which compose them . Apart from circumstances which , as we have seen , // are adequate of themselves to reveal the meaning , not only of single words , but of sentences , apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or descriptive signs , articulation , however perfect , cau bring no intelligence into the mind . The same remarks are applicable to dactylology and writing . By themselves they are incapable of giving any meaning to words . A look of the instructor , or attending circumstances , may give a clue to the meaning , but without some such aid , though all the words in the language should be spelled or written , and committed to memory , there would be no intelligence conveyed by them to the mind . They would be words without meaning . We come now to the fourth method , viz , descriptive signs and illustrative action , in connection with spelling and writing . A class of twelve or fifteen children , all deaf , are assembled in the school-room . They know not the meaning of a word , nor even that words have a meaning . The teacher takes from his pocket a ball , and holding it up , writes the word-ball , on the large slate before them . He looks from the word to the object , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know that ball is the name of the round object with the use and nature of which they have long been acquainted . To commit this word to memory , it must be written by them many times , or spelled many times upon their fingers , or both . It is a great and difficult work , requiring it may be more than a day , to fix firmly in the memory the meaning and the written form of this first word . Time second will be easier . Let the teacher seek for the name of one of the class . His handkerchief will show it . Instantly all are eagerly looking for their own names , producing their handkerchiefs . Their names are written and committed to memory . The teacher writes his own name , which they are made to understand by similar means . With these preparations , he takes the ball and throws it , and then writes , . Afr. threw a ball . He is asked what " a** means , and holds up one finger . The brighter portion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " threw , " means the act which they have just witnessed . And thus , these children gain as clear an idea of the meaning of the sentence , " Mr. threw a ball , " as has the teacher himself . // The language , too , with only this difference , that they have no conception of the sound of the words , means to them just what it means to persons who hear . The scholars are next made actors in throwing the ball or other object , the name of which has been learned , and the more intelligent will write at once without assistance , 11/laster Smith threw a ball , changing the name as often as the actor is changed , and changing the object whenever this is changed . Other verbs which can be illustrated in the school-room , are next introduced-such as drop , lift , bring , carry , eat , drink , go , come , sit , stand , walk , hop , laugh . But at length the actions which can be conveniently performed before the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach such sentences as " A boy climbed a tree . " iNow the deaf and dumb , in talking with each other , represent a boy by putting the hand to the head , and taking hold of an imaginary hat , and then with the open hand , held horizontally , indicate the height of the wearer . A tree , they denote by holding the arm upright and waving it gently , the hand representing the tree top . Why should we worry ourselves in the vain endeavor to give an idea of such a sentence without signs , when it can be so easily and perfectly done by means of them ? The tree waves here in the school-room , the boy advances and climbs it . The meaning eould not be made more clear , if the class were taken into a forest , and a tree climbed in their presence . By signs , the act can be represented in a few seconds . To take the class to witness the actual climbing of a tree , might require half an hour . Again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man shot a bear . " These children do not know the meaning of one of the words . We may show them a man , and then write the word . We may perhaps , by watching , see a man in the act of discharging a gun . But why wait for these contingencies ? They all have probably seen a gun discharged . They have a sign in constant use for a man . A bear , most of them have seen , or his picture , and they denote him by his characteristic hug . We have then , only to make the sign for bear , locating him near or far , as we may choose , make the sign for man , and put him in an appropriate position , and all is plain . The gun is // brought down from the shoulder , the eye runs along the barrel , the trigger is pulled , and the bear falls dead upon the ground . In order that we may have language , and intelligible language , there must be materials of which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words from the lips , yet unless there is some object or scene which these words are known to represent , we merely beat the air . No knowledge is conveyed , no real language is learned . But how are these materials of language to be brought into the school-room ? All these children before us have seen enough and know enough of the affairs and ways of men , if it could only be brought before them , and named , to give them a wide circle of language . The ways of the family , the manifestations of a mother 's love , the various processes in daily household labor ,  --  the cooking , the washing , the ironing , the mending , the spinning , the ploughing , planting , sowing , mowing , the milking of cows , the making of butter and cheese , the feeding of chickens , calves , lambs , pigs , the driving of horses and oxen , the snowballing , sliding down hill , skating , fishing , bathing , cutting down trees , picking up chips , bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all been narrowly observed or participated in by these silent boys and girls , but they do not know by what words to describe them . It will be of no service for us merely to utter or spell the appropriate words . The Lord brought the animals to Adam , before Adam named them . And we must follow this divine example . Ought not he , then , to be hailed by us as an invaluable helper , who could reproduce all these scenes in the school-room ; who could present them with such vividness and fidelity , that the children should clap their hands with delight , and feel that their homes had been brought to them ? But all this and more can be done by the use of signs , and as each object or scene is brought by their agency before the eyes of the class , the appropriate language can be given , given too with a distinctness which precludes the danger of mistake . There is but this one alternative . We must either bring the acts and objects which are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must take him to them , and in their presence while the events are occurring , impart to him the language which fitly describes them . // 511 Signs are never directly taught . The deaf and dumb come gradually and spontaneously into the use of them , as children w.ho hear and speak , do into the practice of speech . But let us seriously ask ourselves what would be the condition of the deaf and dumb , if this language of gesture did not exist , or were suffered to fall into disuse . If gathered into an institution , they still could have no intercourse with each other . Every day , for at least two-thirds of their waking hours , they must be doomed to silence . There would be no means by which their minds could be instructed or interested . Two or three years must thus be passed , or even more , if signs are forbidden to bear any part in their instruction . For a year or two , no atterript could be successfully made to impart religions knowledge . The very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thoughts and feelings , is worthy of special consideration . Some adventure in which he has been engaged may be burning like a fire in his bones . He has thoughts , wants , messages , which lie would gladly make known . These he has only to express in signs , and his teacher can furnish him with the proper words for their communication in language . The use of signs is in itself improving and elevating , especially so , when their grace and beauty are considered . It is impossible to handle such instruments without a reflex influence . All that has been claimed for the drama under the most favorable conditions , the effect on the imagination , the refinement of the taste , the development and elevation of the moral sentiments , may with greater reason be claimed for pan tomime . By means of it , the simple narratives of the Old Testament , the story of Joseph , and Moses and Daniel , David 's great fight with the Philistine , the sweet drama of Ruth , the royal perils of Esther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb with almost the freshness and power which a sight of the original scenes themselves would awaken . The infant Christ in the manger , the heavenly visitants to the shepherds , the wise child in the temple , the wonderful inirades , the wonderful words , and finally the crucifixion and resurrection of the Lord , can be made to pass before the eyes of these children of silence . As one of those compensations of Divine Providence which thoughtful men have so frequen L // occasion to notice , it happens that the deaf and dumb , with no knowledge of written language , shut out , in their isolated state , from all knowledge of the existence of God even , can yet have imparted to them by means of the beautiful and expressive language of gesture , a knowledge of religious truth , more vivid and full than other children ordinarily attain . But not only is the language of signs an instrument of culture , and a means of knowledge in itself , but the process of transferring signs into artificial language is in the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . The subject or narrative given must be clearly understood , the incidents in their proper order and relations must be held in the mind , right words must be chosen , and arranged according to the idioms of written language . The mere uttering of words in the exact order in which they have been spoken , is a work for parrots , requiring little or no exercise of mind . Because the opinion has been expressed by some metaphysical writers , that the deaf and dumb , accustomed from infancy to the use of signs , rarely attain to the habit of thinking in words , the conclusion is hastily drawn by Mr. Hubbard , that their knowledge of written language must necessarily be very imperfect . But may there not be a very good knowledge of a foreign tongue , while yet the mind does not use it in meditation ? Mr. Hubbard , we presume , speaks more than one language , but does he not think in English . It is not the degree of acquaintance merely , but the degree of use , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Ian*uage . If we admit that the deaf and dumb , while at school , do not get a sufficient acquaintance with language , or rather that they do not use it sufficiently to make it the instrument of their thoughts , it does not follow that such a result may not be reached subsequently , when they will be compelled by their circumstances to use language more and signs less . The two faculties employed in the acquisition of language , reception , and use , are quite distinct . From the nature of the case , and in spite of all that can be done , the former of these will be more exercised at school than the latter . That is , the pupil will receive and understand language better than he can use // it . But when he leaves the institution , his circumstances will be very nearly reversed . He xviii be compelled to employ language as well as to understand it , and a very marked improvement is noticed in the readiness and freedom with which pupils of ordinary intelligence use language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is usually assumed that we , who hear , think in words , because in rapid thought , no trace of anything beyond or aside from words , is left in the mind . But is it certain that the mind does not know that a clock is ticking , beause it does not consciously notice it ? Let the ticking cease , and would not this be observed ? Some apprentices to a jeweler discovered that their master would sleep soundly while the hammers were going , but would instantly wake if they ceased . If they wished to play , it was only necessary to detail one or two to keep up the music of the hammers , and they were as safe from detection as if their master had been locked up in the city prison . All which seems to require this parodoxical statement , while the master . heard , he slept , when he could not hear , lie waked . Let the words horse , cow but the words ; that there was no image , or shadow underneath . But if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some characteristic feature of the object which the word represents , will come into the mind , and very nearly , if not quite displace the word itself . The deaf and dumb are children in mental development , not accustomed to watch the operations of their own minds . Their testimony , therefore , on so difficult a question as to what are with them the instruments of thought , would not be of great value . But supposing that the deaf and dumb do always think in signs , and always will , this does not prove that they do not understand written language , or that they get their ideas into words by a slow and painful process . Even if we should admit that the intermediation of signs does retard somewhat the rapidity with which words are read and understood by the deaf and dumb , we think a very plausible argument might be framed , to show that this retardation would be an advantage , rather than a detriment . What is the great reason that words // make so little impression on us 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? Let a text of the New Testainent be translated from the original Greek , and though it be rendered in the very words of the Common Version , a power and fullness of meanin will be found in it , which have never been seen before , and simply because , in this process of translation , every word was necessarily dwelt upon until its real and full meaning was seen and felt . " We never can fully understand our own language , " says Stuart Mill , " until we translate another language into it . " But again , it is considered a great advantage , in the study of words , to know their roots . The fullness and power of a word are greatly augmented , as all readily concede , by such a knowledge of its history and birth . It is not felt by learned men to be an evil , when they see a word , that their minds run back to its root . Now , the signs which the deaf and dumb associate with words are , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and even greater , than are the roots of words . Our conclusion then is , that so far as expressive signs intervene between words and thoughts , in the minds of the deaf and dumb , they are a benefit rather than an injury , giving language more life and power than it has to other persons . We come now to another use of signs , viz. , as a means of determining whether written or printed words are understood by the deaf and dumb . A passage has been committed to memory , it matters not now , whether by articulation , tThquent spelling , or writing . Are the words thus learned coinprehended ? A. most important inquiry . How shall we determine ? We might require the pupil to express the ideas of the passage in other words of the same import . But his knowledge of words is too limited to enable him to do this . If he were a speaking and hearing child , we might assume , as is done in our common schools , that if he did not understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus allow his muemory to be loaded with words which give him no pleasure , because destitute of intelligence . Said a little girl to us the other day , " I do n't understand my geography at all . It is all about the judicial and the executive . I do n't understand a word of it . " For ourselves , we think it a sad thing for any children to // 515 be taught , or , rather , abused in this manner . Jn the case of those who hear , we may console ourselves with the thought that light will come by and by . But no such comforting reflection is possible in respect to the deaf and dumb . If they do not understand the words now , there is little reason to suppose that they ever will . And here we can not help remarking , that a mind which can commit to memory page after page of words , without knowing , or caring to know , their meaning , is but a slight remove from idiocy . But why should this folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is deaf and dumb , when we have in our hands an easy and infallible means of determining whether the words taught are understood or not ? If the deaf and dumb pupil can give the exact idea of the passage learned by signs , he of course understands it . On the one hand , we require him to translate signs into language , to improve his knowledge of language , or to show his facility in the use of it . On the other ; we require him to translate language into signs , to assure us that he understands the language . What folly to reject or despise an instrument of such value , both as a means and test of knowledge ! The following incident shows how liable words are to be misconceived by those who are cut off from that knowledge which comes from circumstances and daily use . There is a story current that an old gentleman , quite zealous for orthodoxy , once visited the American Asylum , and to assure himself of the religious instruction of the pupils , wrote on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man ? " A bright boy , looked earnestly at the question for some time , and then , with the exultant rush of a discoverer , turned to his slate and wrote , " I am not sure , but I think it must be his head . " Looking now , for a moment , at practical results , the only decisive test after all of the value of methods of instruction , we ask , what is actually accomplished by the method of teaching the deaf and dumb now commonly practiced in this country , viz. , by signs , in connection with dactylology and writing ? What attainments do they make in language ? The answer , if truly made , must be that there is a wide diversity in the results attained . Some succeed so well as to show in the use of language // no traces of their infirmity . Others exhibit many peculiarities and imperfections . These differences may be traced to two prominent causes , original difference in capacity , or insufficiency of the time they have been under instruction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of articulation-have been attained where the whole time of an instructor has been given to one or two pupils for many successive years . Such a devotion to individual pupils is of course impracticable in a public institution . But there is need of reform in all our institutions in this respect . The classes , if not made very small , should at least be so graded that those of nearly equal capacity and attainments should be taught together . More teachers would be required , and the expense would be increased ; but it is in vain to look for the highest results until this is made the invariable rule . The dull pupils will become discouraged or be driven to despair , by being required to do more than they can . The bright ones fall into impatien*e or laziness by having too little to do . Moderate capacities in the deaf child are no bar to the ultimate attainineut of language . It is only necessary to take more time , to proceed more slowly and with more repetition . Some are doubtless discouraged and sink into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along more slowly might have made good scholars . As precisely the same period is allowed for the instruction of pupils of every grade , and as this period is not too long for the very brightest , it must needs be too short for the proper instruction of those who are dull in intellect . But with these exceptions and explanations , we are prepared to say that such a knowledge of language , and such power in the use of it , is acquired by the great body of the pupils in our institutions for the deaf and dumb , that they are thereby practically restored to society . They correspond with their friends . They read books and newspapers . They know what is passing in the world around them , and feel that they are a part of it and not excluded from it . Such being the effect of education on the mind of a deaf child , it is well to consider how it is with him personally . How does he succeed in making his way among mnen ? Can lie make himself understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided as one of another race , with whom hearing and speaking persons can have no communion and hold no intercourse ? Is his knowledge of signs an advantage or a disadvantage to him ? Is he , and must he be , an outcast and a wanderer , simply because he can not utter words from his lips ? Does he find men and women who have hearing and speech willing to converse with him by writino ' ? These questions obviously cover the whole ground . The reply to them is easy . The great majority of our people , in the first place , have sufficient education to enable them to understand writing and to communicate with the deaf and dumb by that means 2 . Their interest in these children of misfortune is uniformly so great as to make them quite willing to submit to the extra labor and perplexity attending this mode of communication . 3 . Signs are always a most attractive feature to all classes of people . They are delighted to see them , and especially pleased that they can understand them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education as our institutions are able to give , are objects of favor and interest with all men . They fill , usefully and profitably , the various trades in which speaking people are employed . Not a pauper , a few years since , was to be found among the graduates of the American Asylum . And finally , what is more and better , they are made acquainted with the way of salvation through Jesus Christ , and are many of them bright examples of piety . Before closing this Article , it might naturally be expected that we should make some more particular reference to articu - lation , as an accomplishment to be taught the deaf We call it an accomplishment , for a means of instruction , except in a very limited degree , it is not . The excessive desire which some parents feel that their deaf-born children should be taught to speak , arises , we are persuaded , from a wish to forget or conceal from themselves the terrible fact that their children are deaf . But though , by the trickery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they are none the less so to themselves . A silence , such as finds no image for comparison , reigns and must reign in their souls . The repugnance felt by some to writing and spelling , as a means of communicating with the deat , is due in part to its strangeness , and may be // expected to pass away by use . An equal and even greater embarrassment is experienced , when , for the first time , we attempt to speak through an ear trumpet . We can think of nothing to say . We find it difficult to realize that we are talking to a person . But there should be some better reason for teaching articulation than that the parent may be aided in forgetting the terrible infirmity which has fallen upon his child , or that it is easier or more agreeable for the parent to hold intercourse with him by words than by spelling and writing . The only question that enlightened parental love should ask is , what will be most agreeable to my nnfortunate child , what will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaf-born child ? Is it a pleasure to him to exercise the vocal apparatus , so far as such exercise is practicable to one in his circumstances ? No . The effort to speak is inexpressibly wearying and painful to him . Even those who had learned to speak before the loss of hearing , feel a great repugnance to using the voice as a means of communication . The reason is obvious . There is with them not only an entire absence of the pleasure which other children have in hearing the sound , and the pleasant modulations of their own voices , but there is a positive pain in these vocal ntterances . " It hurts . " In some of the German schools it is admitted that serious injury sometimes results . One young man of great promise and excellence died from hemorrhage brought on , as was confessed , by violent and unnatural straining of the lungs in the attempt to teach articulation . In all ordinary and natural use of the muscles , nature has provided a safeguard to prevent their being injured by excessive straining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can , because it hurts so much that we are constrained to stop . Were it not for this warning we should , in moments of excitement , tear our muscles and tendons in sunder . In the use of the voice we have two safeo'uards : first , the ear , which notifies us at once of any unnatural strain , by the disagreeableness and strangeness of the tone ; secondly , the pain in the vocal organs themselves . But where the hearing is lost , and the vocal organs have never been exercised , how shall the deaf person determine when he is injuring his voice and lungs by too vio // lent or persistent efforts ? The ear can not tell him . The cries of pain that the organs give out , he is told must not be regarded , because they are tbe effects , not of over-exertion but of disuse . It may pain us greatly at first to move a stiff limb , but unless we bear the pain and continue to move it , we can never recover the use of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the organs of his voice . This pain is owing to the disuse . By and by it will be less . With nothing , then , in nature to hold him back from over exertion , is it strange that great and fatal injuries sometimes result from these &amp;nnatural efforts ? A deaf and dumb gentleman writes to us that he became deaf from scarlet fever , at the age of five years ; that on recovering from his illness he had lost all memory of sound , could not repeat even the names of his parents or sisters . " I was at once sent to school to be taught to spell , but the pronunciation of the words had no understanding . So I was let loose , like a young colt , to ramble over the hills , screaming and making all sorts*of noises , to bring my vocal organs into action . " The effect of articulation upon his vocal organs he thus describes . " At the start Ifeel the voice come through my nose , and it comes out only very low . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I feel a tickling in my throat , and my eyes give vent to tears , and I am obliged to stop . I was for three years under the care of a professor of articulation , but could make no improvement in my voice . " Dr. Kitto , who lost his hearing at twelve , says that he almost immediately found himself unwilling to talk , and it was only by stratagem that he was prevailed upon to do so . What do learned physicians tell us is the origin of the clergyman 's sore throat ? Simply an unnatural and mechanical mode of speaking . They say , if the clergyman would throw away his manuscript and allow his thoughts to telegraph through the nerves to the vocal apparatus , there would result such a gentle and beautiful play of the vocal muscles , that none would be wearied or overstrained . Speech , in its effect upon the vocal organs of one born deaf , is very much like what a violent fit of coughing is to our throats . It rasps and tears . Articulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , because it takes so long a time to acquire it . " It // is the testimony of German teachers , " says Prof Park , of Andover , Mass. , the most recent visitor of the German schools , " that pupils who are taught articulation only four or five ye*irs , will soon abandon it , but if they are taught seven or eight years they will continue to use this method of intercourse . " No wonder if , like the children of Israel in the wilderness , they murmur and repine , and think they shall never come into Canaan . Indeed the comparison is more apt than we supposed when it first occurred to us . For the number who actually arrive at satisfactory results , are but the Calebs and Joshuas of the great multitudes who commenced the journey . Articulation is distasteful to the deaf , thirdly , because they know that their voices are not agreeable . Sometimes they may exaggerate this , and sometimes it is impossible for them to do so . The filing of a saw , arid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce a more disagreeable sound than that which is made in some of these artificial attempts at *speech by the deaf and dumb . Knowing that their voices are so disagreeable , is it to be wondered at that they should be unwilling to carry on their intercourse with others by means of speech ? What do we think of parent* who are stupid or cruel enough to insist that their children , who have neither voice nor ear , shall sing before strangers ? and what ought we to think of parents who would impose a still more disagreeable duty on their deaf-born children , by requiring them to speak in the presence of others ? But it may be said that the feelings of the child are of little consequence , provided we secure to him the highest good . What then are the advantages of articulation ? Does it benefit the minds of those who practice it ? Is it useful to them as a means of instruction ? If all signs are excluded where articulation is taught , as it is claimed they are in the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say that however great the attainments of the deaf child may be in articulation , his mind will still be in darkness . If lie is taught language by other practicable methods , lie is a sufferer to just the extent that his time has been taken from these methods in his efforts to acquire articulate speech . If one-third of his time has been occupied in this way , then in a course of instruction // running through six years , he has lost two entire years . But will not articulation enable the deaf to communicate with the hearing and speaking world , and thus be of incalculable benefit to him ? Deaf children , taught by the methods pursued in our American schools , have three modes of intercourse with others , either of which they can use at . pleasure ; viz. , writing , spelling , and descriptive signs , while the child who has been taught to articulate has but this one method : that is , it is laid down as a necessity that he must not practice other methods , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitate to challenge a comparison between the best scholars in the German schools and in our own , as to the ease and readiness with which they could receive and communicate ideas . It would be found that while our best pupils could receive ideas on all subjects to any extent by writing , and could communicate their own in the same way with no liability to mistake or misconception , the lmibor of conversing with the dehf by speech and reading of the lips , is so great and difficult and wearisome to all parties that , as a matter of fact , in general intercourse , none but the most necessary things are introduced into conversation . The conversations are made as brief as possible , and both parties are equally thankful when they are over . It will be found that this difficulty of intercourse by speech will increase in proportion as the deaf child is withdrawn from cultivated people , and thrown among tradesmen and mechanics . They will talk with him no more and no longer than absolute necessity requires . The results of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irksome and painful process when the pupils cease to be driven to it by their teachers , they gladly let it drop . It is so difficult for them to make themselves understood , and for them to understand others , that they become discouraged and cease to speak at all . Speaking is attended with such embarrassment and difficulty that there is a constant temptation to abridge and shorten as much as possible , until their speech becomes a mere skeleton of language , a sort of signs in words . Such a mode of speaking involves at length the loss of the structure of sentences , takes away all pleasure from reading or renders it impossible , and thus the process is one of constant deterioration . // With our best pupils , on the other hand , favorites whereever they go , writing , spelling , or making signs as the exigency may require , able to make themsel yes understood in any coinpany by signs alone , winning regard and information from all with whom they come in contact , able to read books with increasing pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little sense of isolation , how wide the contrast ! We have confined the comparison hitherto to the best puj ) ils of the two schools . But there is one painful fact which must not be omitted . Not more than one-fourth of those taught in the German schools attain such a knowledge of articulation as to be of practical benefit to them , while in our own schools every child not deficient in capacity is macic acquainted with written language . " It is a very sad feature , " says Professor Vaisse , " of the schools where what has been called the German system is more thoroughly carried on , that a very large proportion of their pupils are dismissed before completing their course of fustruction , on the score of their being unable to speak , and consequently to be taught anything at all in such instituti ons . " Mr. Henry W. Syle , who has recently visited all the important British schools for the deaf and dumb , writes that not one in thirty of those born deaf receive any benefit from articulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attempts to teach it are failures . Mr. Syle is a nephew of the late lamented Henry Winter Davis , of Baltimore , and a most coinpetent witness . It is not difficult to explain the mistakes so often made by intelligent men in their examination of foreign schools . In the first place they go abroad with no knowledge of our own schools for the deaf and dumb , as it respects either their system of instruction or the results attained by it . Secondly , they suppose that articulation is a new thing , when there are at all times in our American schools persons wholly deaf , who cami both speak and read from the lips . Thirdly , they are ignorant of the fact that it is only those , with rare exceptions , who lost their hearing after having learned to speak that are taught anywhere to articulate with success . It would , doubtless , be of advantage to all children if they // could have instruction as to the manner of using the vocal organs in littering the various sounds , both simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , the child 's oily endeavor is to imitate his parents . If the speech of the parents is defective , the child 's will be so . But where the speech of the parent is perfect , or very nearly so , the speech of the child may be marred by great defects . These , in part , he may copy from others , but very much of the imperfection of speech is to be imputed to a natural indolence of the inuscle* of the voice . Certain sounds are more difficult to utter than others somewhat resembling them , and there will be a constant tendency to substitute the easy for the difficult . The Yankee dialect so admirably exhibited by Professor Lowell , in the Biglow Papers , is not merely the imitation , by one generation , of the manner of speaking of its predecessor , but is a result of this indolent and shirking habit to which all the muscles of the body are more or less inclined . Thus , to say " hender " is much easier than to say " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " ith " than with . That this mode of speaking is due very largely to this natural tendency to shirk labor in the vocal muscles , that is to substitute that which is easy for that which is more difficult , was strikingly illustrated in an experiment which we lately tried . We requested a semi-mute to read to us Zekle 's courtship from the Biglow Papers . He did not at once understand the meaning of the words under the new form of spelling , but it was a pleasure to see how much easier lie found it to pronounce them after this manner than in the correct mode . Probably there is no nation on the face of the earth whose mode of uttering the words of their language is so defective as ours . Very grievous mistakes are not only made in the utterance of the vowel sounds , but the tongue and the lips seem often to refuse to perform their office in uttering the consonants . By all means then let us have teachers of articulation , but let them begin with those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to rant in declamation , but to utter correctly all the vowel sounds of the language . Let them learn to open their mouths , let them be made to understand by actual experiment that it is the immovable position of the upper // lip which causes for the most part the disagreeable habit of talking through the nose-let them avoid distressing precision of utterance on the one hand , and a shameful neglect of all care for distinctness and completeness on the other . Let words be made to come out from their months as coins newly dropped from the mint . When those to whom God has given all their senses , have learned to speak , then perhaps we may favor attempts to impart to the deaf also this great accomplishment.
