Washington . No political arrangement has been the object of more admiration than the American Constitution . Almost ever since its adoption , few Americans , except the members of one small and politically very insignificant sect , have spoken of it except in terms of the highest eulogy . In speeches , in lectures , articles , and orations , in the pulpit and in the forum , it has constantly been treated as the most skilful attelnpt ever made to form a confederation , and as the arrangement best suited to the States , not only at the time of its adoption , but for all time . Down to the outbreak of the present war suggestions for its amendment were generally regarded as indicatioiis of folly or fanaticism . It was , in short , held up to the gaze of the world as a final result , which required no modification , and to which // coming generations would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this adoration was a tradition from the generation which had lived and suffered under the old Confederacy , and witnessed the great change wrought by the formation of the new government , - the restoration of national credit and of the national dignity , the return of public confidence , the full assurance of peace and the enjoyment of tranquillity . What has been added to it in our day has been largely due to the fact that the Constitution has been the symbol and condition of the Union of the States , and everybody has been conscious that in the Union alone was to be found what in this age is felt to be the sweetest , if not the most valuable , of political blessings , sweeter even than liberty or security , - the privilege of belonging to a great nation . There is , perhaps , no political calamity from which the men of the nineteenth century shrink with so much dread , as from living under a foreign yoke or under a weak government . That if he have a tyrant , his tyrant shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport shall be respected whenever it is shown , is to the malecontent of our day the first of political blessings . For all others he can wait , as all others , he feels , are sure to come if this one be secured . Amongst us the feeling has been intensified by the long association of national power with liberty and prosperity . There has been nothing in the past to throw over the American 's yearnings for greatness and expansion that shade of dread and misgiving as to its effect on individual rights , from which those of the most patriotic of European liberals are never entirely free . With liberty so fully and so long secured that all danger to it from any quarter seemed chimerical , the American imagination has been left free to revel in dreams of national grandeur ; and as long as the Union lasted , no dream on this subject could well be deemed wild or extravagant . But an attempt to account for the sacredness of the Constitution would , in our opinion , be incomplete , which took no notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American people , but of the whole Anglo-Saxon race . It is a characteristic which the peculiar conditions of life in // the New World are perhaps gradually effacing amongst us , but which has played a very prominent part in English history , and has exercised , or is now exercising , a very strong influence on our own . We mean that dislike to pure speculation , that distaste for theorizing and repugnance to the logical method of solving legal and political problems , which have made the English Constitution a patchwork of makeshifts and expedients , and of the English legal system , to use Mr. Austin 's words , " a monstrous chaos . " For all purposes of government , abstract theories have in the eyes of a genuine Anglo-Saxon very little value . But let them , however illogical or indefensible , be once thrown into a concrete form and assume the shape of an " institution , " and our devotion to them is shown in the direct ratio of our previous dislike or neglect . The formula once framed , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or analyze it , is generally so intense as to be nearly insurmountable . The impatience of Frenchmen under the restraints of a constitution , their chronic eagerness to break loose from it aud plunge anew into the depths of revolutionary sentiment , are to the Anglo-Saxon mind utterly incomprehensible ; while to them our reverence for what is written because it is written , and the English submission to a legalized abuse for the simple reason that it is old , bear all the marks of . a degrading superstition . The English have this incapacity to recur to fundamentabprinciples in so marked a degree , that it is safe to say that nothing but the " omnipotence of Parliament " has saved them from political stagnation . If " the wisdom of their ancestors " had bestowed on them a written organic law , nothing short of a tremendous social revolution like that of France would have sufficed to place the nation on the path of progress . And , although we have been saved from sinking to the lowest depths of this idolatry , both by the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by the circumstances in which we are ourselves placed , we have given proofs of an ability , as well as a disposition , to weave an artificial arrangement into the very texture of our political thought , which a philosopher might well call alarming . There is something really startling in the fatal facility we have shown in erecting an artificial standard of right and // wrong , and in allowing it to shut out from our gaze all the higher criteria of political conduct furnished by abstract justice and truth . During a long period tbe work of testing the morality of national legislation by the application of fundamental principles was abandoned by the leading minds of the country , and fell into the hands of the Abolitionists , - a body which , admirable as its aims have been , has had too narrow a field of vision , and been too deficient iii the art of practical application , and had too little national feeling , to make the influence of its utterances on general politics of much value . In the eyes of most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on questions of government , the Federal Constitution gradually , and we believe imperceptibly , became a final rule of right , behind which there was nothing to which good citizens were called upon to look for guidance . This hallucination , of course , made itself more strongly manifest in the conflict about slavery than elsewhere , because it was in this that law and principles were brought most strongly into contrast and collision . Some of the phenomena to which it gave rise will always remain amongst the most striking incidents in our political history . There could not , for instance , have been a more forcible illustration of the danger of Constitution-worship than the general contempt and ridicule excited at one time by appeals to the " higher law . " This phrase meant , in the mouths of those who originated it , that government is after all a conventional arrangement , entitled , no doubt , to the utmost respect , and not to be disturbed unless it plainly fails to answer the purpose for which it was instituted ; but that cases may arise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth are so clearly outraged , under color of law , that it becomes the duty of good citizens to be guided rather by the principles of morality , on which the law ultimately rests all its claims to obedience , than by the law itself . We believe there is no Christian country , except Russia , in which this proposition , as here stated , would be denied even by the firmest supporters of " authority " ; but it nevertheless , not very long ago , whenever any attempt was made to apply it to the relations of a citizen of the Free States with slavery , excited the scorn and derision of a large portion of the American public . It was evidently // expected of those antislavery men who conscientiously revolted against their " constitutional obligations , " not only that they should bear them patiently in the hope of change , but that they should distinctly acknowledge that the Constitution of the United States was a final authority , the supreme law of morals as well as of the land . Their recognition , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more binding rule , was received with mii*gled amusement and execration , as the crowning proof of their folly or knavery . It is not to be wondered at that many of those who believe that " progress " means increase of virtue and intelligence , as well as of wealth , should have looked upon this indication of popular feeling as a symptom of moral deterioration . Complete harmony between what is and what ought to be , will probably never be witnessed in any political organization ; for as long as men are men , considerations purely material must have their weight in the conduct of government , as well as considerations purely moral ; but no condition of public sentiment can be healthy , which does not make the predominance of the latter the great aim of legislation . Nor is it on the morals only of the nation that the effect of Constitution-worship has been bad . It has been largely instrumental in putting a stop to all vigorous exploratiomi in the field of legislative science . For half a century or more the study of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the North . In the South it has received much attention , but solely owing to the general anxiety of Southern statesmen to frame a new social organization , in which slavery should have a place de jure as well as de facto . Mr. Calhoun was perhaps the most acute and vigorous writer on governmuent that we have produced within the present century . But the smallness of the contributions made by the Free States to the literature of political philosophy has been very remarkable . We have far outstripped the rest of the world in what are called " constituti*nnl lawyers . " Our judges and connuentators have acquired the widest celebrity as skilful and shrewd expounders of the organic law . Their applications of its provisions to the complex phenomena of our social and political condition have been marvels of ingenuity and erudi // tion . But the examination and elucidation of the principles on which governments ought to rest , one of the highest and most interesting pursuits in which the human understanding can engage , has generally been neglected by our ablest men , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as an occupation fit only for French or German " reds " or for boy debaters . The study of the law as it is has attracted all the keenest intellects in the country , while the consideration and discussion of what the law ought to be have been left , strangely enougl* , to newspaper editors and clergymen , - two classes singularly ill-fitted for the task ; the one from the nature of its duty , and the other from that of its training . What is called " political preaching , " and is so vigorously denounced by some people , has been in reality nothing more than an instinctive effort on the part of the Church to perform a work properly belonging to the world , but which the world has neglected ; but it is a work which must be done by somebody in every nation that aspires to keep its place in civilization . It is , of course , rash to assert that any social phenomenon is due to a single cause ; and we do not wish to have it understood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science has been caused solely by excessive reverence for the Constitution . Much of it is doubtless to be ascribed to the overwhelming importance naturally assu med by material pursuits , in a new country of boundless resources ; and much to the loss of political influence of late years by a large portion of that class which has most taste and capacity for speculative inquiry . But after all due allowance has been made for these things , there is still a large residuum which is clearly attributable to the general prevalence of the belief , that , when the Federal Constitution was framed , time canon of political revelation was complete ; that , whether the order of timings which it established was bad or good , no better was possible , and that the duty of this and coming generations was , imot to reform , but " to rest and be tlmankful . " We may indeed be told , also , that it is not strictly true that time North Imas not labored in the field of political speculation that the vast changes wlmich hmave been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great majority of the // States prove that a large amount of thought has really been expended upon it , and that there has always existed a strong sensibility to errors and abuses , and strong anxiety to amend them . These changes have certainly generally been radical enough to raise the presumption that they had been prepared by a good deal of mental labor ; but we know , as a matter of history , that such was not the case . rfhere is not one of them which was the work of trained thinkers . They have been the result of the pressure of the democratic tide , which has been steadily rising , here as well as in Europe , ever since the French Revolution ; and this is tantamount to saying that they were the offspring of desire rather than of opinion . We owe most of these changes to the determination of the whole male population to share in the exercise of the whole governing power , and to share in it at any cost . The result is , that much of their handiwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific polish and adjustment . There are provisions in most of the new Constitutions which could not possibly have been inserted deliberately , and of their own free will , by men who had made a close study either of political science or of human nature ; the election of judges for short terms , by universal suffrage , is one of them . The spell has been broken by the war ; criticism has been let loose even upon the Constitution of the United States . The secession of the South has satisfied even the most sceptical that a thing may be unconstitutional and still possible , and that the Constit*mtion , admirable as it is , has not fully served its purpose . Its object was to hold the States of this Union together , - whether as a nation or a confederation it matters not ; and it has not succeeded in accomplishing it . We might , as every one knows , fill a hundred volumes in tracing out the causes of the disruptiomi ; but it is not necessary that we should even briefly enumerate them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uption has taken place . Of course it might have been prevented by the occurrence or non-occurrence of a vast number of things . If the Abolitionists and Fire-eaters had kept quiet ; if cotton had not become so important ; if Jefferson Davis and his associates had not been so ambitious ; if the North had been firmer , wiser , and more united ; and if slavery had never // existed ,  --  no doubt the Union would never have been dissolved , and the doctrine of Secession might never have been heard of . But propositions of this kind , though they have constituted the gist of nine tenths of the disquisitions which have appeared on the war and its origin , are , after all , barren truisms ; and , after we have established them to everybody 's satisfaction , we are not a whit better off than before . If everything always went right , of course nothing would ever go wrong . If the citizens of the United States were all wise and virtuous , as they undoubtedly ought to be , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , but the Union might have been preserved without any constitution whatever . But governments have to be framed in this age of the world , - and the same thing may be said of every other age , - not for men as they ought to be , but as they are . Their vices have to be taken into account with even more care and confIdence than their virtues . Any political fabric which is erected for their benefit must be strong enough to contain the selfish as well as the public-spirited , the knave as well as the honest man , the ambitious as well as the disinterested , the . traitors as well as the patriots , the fools as well as the wise . And any arrangement which is intended to bind the North and South together in one political organization must be strong enough , either to defy the efforts of slaveholders to break it down , or to put an end to slavery . We are saved the necessity of all argument on this point by the experience of the last eighty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution ought to have held the Free and Slave States together , we reply , that the experiment has been fully tried , and that it did not succeed . This ought not to be said , however , without exonerating the founders of the government from all responsibility for the catastrophe which we are now witnessing . The adulators who would have us believe that the men of 1787 foresaw the changes which have brought about the crisis through which we are passing , that they framed the Constitution for just such a North and such a South as now exist , do them gross injustice . It reflects no discredit upon them that they should not have foreseen the social and commercial revolution which has // created a gulf between the two sections ; but it would certainly lower our estimate of their sagacity , if it could be shown that they foresaw the creation of this gulf , and yet relied on the arran gement which they formed to bridge it over . But to have foreseen in 1787 the career that slavery was to run , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would have required wisdom more than human . At that time its friends as well as its enemies looked on it as an institution whose extinction was certain , at a period perhaps not very distant . It occupied the ignoble position of a makeshift , and almost everybody felt bound at least to make a pretence of deploring it as a violation of natural justice . It is rarely touched upon in the writings and speeches of leading Southern men of the period , without eliciting an allusion and comment in some degree deprecatory . There is abundant evidence that , so far from its having acquired the honors of a fundamental social relation , its existence in a republic was very generally looked upon as a scandal which owed its origin to English favor and encouragement , and which would not have been tolerated had not its removal been surrounded by humanitarian as well as financial difficulties . In fact , the difference in the sentiments of the North and South on this subject was one of degree rather than of kind , and was mainly due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two sections . It was the invention of the power-loom , followed by the introduction of the cotton culture , that first started the South in that downward course which has at last led her into the abyss in which she now lies bleeding . The power-loom created an enormous demand for cotton , and the cotton-gin enabled the slaveholders to satisfy it . Arkwright and Whitney were in reality the innocent authors of the revolution which raised slavery out of the position of a genteel but rather objectionable encumbrance , to that of a highly profitable machine . As the price of the great staple rose , the discussion of the legality of slaveholding gradually ceased . Slaves multiplied under the new stimulus ; but the more they multiplied , the more the conscience of the world became troubled by their condition , and at last the clergy and moralists of the South were set to work to find justification for keeping them . The result , as we all // know , was the concoction of a system of social and political philosophy , in which slavery is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which everybody who works with his hands is not only deiiied all share in the government , but handed over to capitalists as " property " ; in which education is declared to be the privilege of the wealthy alone , unnecessary and hurtful to the poor ; in which all the ideas of human rights and of human destiny prevalent at the time of our Revolution , as well as throughout the civilized world at this hour , are repudiated and pronounced false , mischievous , and absurd . A society with slavery for its base , with these ideas governing legislation and moulding the manners , is clearly something more than " another form of industry , " as some of our enphemists call it : it is another form of civilization . The persistence , however , with which some of the leaders even of the Republican party persuade themselves that the history of the last eighty years has shed no fresh light upon the conditions of union , is one of the most curious and discouraging incidents of the day . Mr. Foster of Connecticut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Law in the Senate , in April last , opposed the repeal of the act of 1793 on the express ground that Roger Sherman and Oliver Ellsxvorth voted for it , and asks triumphantly , " XVho are we in this day to say that wisdom has come to us unknown to our fathers ? " We doubt if the worship of ancestors has ever been carried much further than this even in China . There is not a mechanic in the United States who is not , or o i*ght not to be , far wiser than either Sherman or Ellsworth , or Franklin or Hamilton , or any other man of the last century , concerning the merits and short-comings of the Constitution , concerning the advisability or unadvisabihity of acting under its permissory clauses , concerning the political needs and tendencies of this Union and of this age , and above all , concerning the nature and influence of negro slavery . To deny this is to deny all value to human experience , and stamp all change , or in other words all progress , with folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for the Fugitive Slave Law , were they now living , because they voted for one in 1793 , is about as sensible as to assume that Oliver // Cromwell would , if he commanded an army in our day , discard rifled cannon . The men of the Revolutionary epoch framed the Constitution in the belief that it would work ; but their belief was based on conjecture , - the conjecture of able and sagacious men certainly , but still conjecture . But where they saw as in a glass darkly , we see face to face ; where they struggled through mire , we stand on firm ground . To abandon our right to amend it , or to reason for ourselves on the altered state of facts which surrounds us , in deference to their authority , would be as degrading and as extraordinary a confession of degeneracy as has ever been made by any body of civilized men . Those who oppose any movement for the abolition of slavery by an amendment to the Constitution , do so mainly on the ground that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectually than we can do it by voting ; and that wherever slavery is not disappearing before the advance of the Union armies , it is disappearing by the action of the States themselves . Now we have little doubt that in Maryland , Missouri , and Arkansas we shall witness within the next two years immediate and complete emancipation by the vote of the people of these States . But there is at present nothing to warrant us in looking for any such display of wisdom on the part of Virginia and the Cotton States . It is quite true that the slaves actually within those States at present have been declared free by the I*resident 's Proclamation , but it is equally true that his Proclamation is not a final and conclusive authority ; it is open to revision by the Supreme Court , and its constitutionality is at least doubtful . It may be annulled by the decision of that tribunal , and even those who are most confident that it will not be annulled , must confess that it would be at least rash to leave matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people , and the form of social organization that is to prevail over half the continent , to the hazard and *incertainty of a judicial decision , when the means of settling them in accordance with the dictates of justice and expediency are within our reach . If the Emancipation Proclamation should be declared null and void , it leaves the negroes who were in bondage at the time it was issued still in bondage ; and , // in any event , whether it be valid or invalid , the institution of slavery is not in the least affected by it . Certain persons are declared free by it , but it does not touch the system ; for the legislature of any State would still be competent to enslave any blacks not covered by the Proclamation ; such , for instance , as free negroes , and children born after the 1st of January , 1863 . It must not be forgotten , too , that the Proclamation will always be regarded in the South as what Mr. Lincoln intended it to be when he issued it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Supreme Court will give it , in the eyes of slaveholders , any higher character than that of an act of personal hostility to themselves . It can never have for them , and it has not now , as we all know , for many people at the North , the force and dignity of a law . The liberation of slaves under it will be to their masters a perpetual reminder of their subjugation , the direct and palpable consequence of defeat in an armed struggle , and as such humiliating and exasperating . In other words , it will have no moral weight at the South after the war is over any more than while it is raging , and will , we may depend upon it , be resisted and evaded whenever and wherever the opportunity offers . The amount of benefit the negroes will derive from it , therefore , after peace is restored , will depend almost entirely , in our opinion , upon the ability and willingness of the Administration , for the time being , to enforce it faithfully . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be largely affected by the personal character of the President . If Mr. Lincoln should have passed away , it will be to his successor , eveii supposing him to approve in a general way of Mr. Lincoln 's policy , a matter of small account , as long as the public peace is not disturbed by it , whether a few thousand blacks here and there are restrained of their liberty . Arid even supposing him to be sincerely devoted to the policy of emancipation , or supposing Mr. Lincoln himself to be still in the VYhite House , they overestimate , it seems to us , the depth of the trouble to Northern minds occasioned by negro wrongs per se , who suppose that the public of the Free States would press on him the adoptiomi of a more vigorous policy . There is too much reason to fear the North will by that time be too weary of civil strife , too // anxious to obliterate all traces of it and restore the ancient harmony and good feeling , to be disposed to put armies in motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the liberties of blacks who can show no better title to them than the at least doubtful one of a measure of " military necessity . " It might be different if the negroes were men of a sterner mould and more indomitable spirit , men who not simply de-. sired freedom , but hated oppressors . But it must be confessed that their apathy during the present struggle has disappointed both their friends and enemies . The tameness with which they suffer themselves to be assassinated , to be carried back into bondage and held in it , and with which they have submitted to every other outrage which either party chooses to inflict upon them , may be proof either of sublime patience or of extreme degradation ; but , in either case , it indicates a state of mind which , though it may have spared us some embarrassment during the war , promises to throw serious obstacles in the way of their redemption after the restoration of peace . Some trace of self-respect , even if it take the low form of savage vindictiveness , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fails to reveal itself in a whole race , and when this race has to assert its claims to mere manhood against oppressors of such a fierce and vigorous type as the Southeru slaveholder , it is hard to say how much third parties cau do to help it . So far , the negroes have shown themselves ready enough to run away , and even to fight for their freedom , when we choose to enlist and organize them ; but to avail themselves of our protection to the full extent , they must give stronger evidence of love of freedom than this . Time and training , and especially the service of large numbers of them in our armies , will doubtless eventually awaken in them a natural feeling of resentment towards those who do them wrong , - a feeling which has perhaps done more for freedom and civilization than all others put together . But until it is roused , the difficulties in the way of their complete liberation will be immense , - such difficulties , in short , as will call for the active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly its legislative powers . // Their title to their freedom must be made as strong as law can make it . This is , of course , tantamount to saying that we do not share the general reliance upon the growth or prevalence at the South of hostility to slavery as the cause of the present trouble . There is little doubt that this feeling prevails in the Border States , which have either never thoroughly sympathized with the Rebellion , or have been so long in the grasp of our armies that they have lost most of their slaves , see little hope of their ever having any more , and are ready for anything which promises them repose . But we do not know where the proof is to be found that public opinion in the rest of the South has undergone any radical change , or in fact any change whatever , as to the advantages , moral , material , or political , of the slave system . Whatever the people of the Gulf States thought on these points before the war , we feel satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has occurred to modify their prejudices . Their doctrine of the morality or divine origin of the institution , of course , if sincerely held , can not be shaken by the successes of our armies . The loss of slaves proves nothing as to the owner 's right to hold them , and they probably look on it in the same light as the loss of any other species of property , - one of the inconveniences inseparable from an armed struggle . And there is no denying that the war has revealed some points of advantage in slavery for military purposes , of which we at the North were far from suspecting the existence . Slaves whom the presence of the public enemy does not rouse into revolt , or even into insubordination , are clearly not that source of weakness , in a military point of view , which we were in the habit of considering them . The Southern negroes belong to this class . The number of whites engaged in the work of superintending and guarding them must have been greatly diminished during the last three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single attempt at a rising , or even a riot . Meek and long-suffering beyond example , loving liberty only with that mild and unfruitful love from which energizing hatred of the oppressor is excluded , they have , as far as we know , continued to toil on the plantations to which our army has not penetrated , as peaceably , helplessly , and // hopelessly since the war began as before it . And for the military purposes of the Confederacy , they have this capital advantage , that they consume a vastly smaller proportion of what they produce than free laborers . Of course , it would be very easy to show that the South loses much by having four millions of her population indifferent to the issue of the struggle in which she is engaged , serving her with the slow indolence of cattle , instead of the passion and devotion , the versatility and industry of free men . But this is a loss for which the advocates of slavery were prepared , and for which they hold themselves compensated by the abseiice of the pauperism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their delirium , conceive to be the inseparable concomitants of " free society . " In fact , to convince a Southerner of the inferiority of slavery to free labor , as a supporter of armies in the field , would be to deprive it of its greatest value in his eyes . But towards this desirable consummation the war has certainly contributed nothing ; for no free community of the same size has ever raised larger armies , or produced the rnat6riel of war in greater abundance , or displayed greater skill , dexterity , and ability in turning their resources to account , than the Confederacy . In short , we do not know of a single reason , revealed by the war , that should lead a Southerner , imbued with the ordinary Southerii notions of the ends of civil society , to conclude that slavery is a misfortune ; while there are several that should lead him to consider it a benefit . We fear , therefore , that those who look for the destruction of slavery by means of a revolution in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established will find themselves rudely undeceived , when perhaps the opportunity which now offers itself of using surer and more potent means for its extinction will have passed away , if not forever , at least for our time . But even if slavery were abolished by an amendment to the Constitution , though we should have secured for the first time a sound logical foundation for our political fabric , we should still find it far short of our ideal . We should have embodied in it , indeed , a recognition of the great truth , - not that men are literally born equal , that is , with equal capabilities and advantages , - but that they are born with equal right to turn // such faculties as God has pleased to give them to the best account . Any democratic Constitution in which this truth is not solemnly recognized furnishes , as . ours has furnished , one of those satires on popular consistency and popular justice in which cynics and tyrants delight . But after having recognized it ever so fully , much beside remains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any means flatter themselves that they had in framing it , even supposing slavery never to have existed , provided a machine of perfect accnracy and finish , and that posterity would never find room for improvement in it . The doctrine of its perfection was invented by a later generation , and long before its working had been thoroughly tested . On the contrary we find , both in the debates of the Convention and in the Federalist , an incessant iteration of the confession that the Constitution was not by any means the best thing that those who were chiefly instrumental in framing it could have thought of , but the best thing which at that time , with the ideas then current , and under the circumstances in which the States were then placed , the public could be induced to accept . It was not the ideal either of the Federalists or the Democrats , either of the slaveholders or the antislavery men , either of the large States or of the small ones , of the North or of the South . It satisfied neither Hamilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compromise between a variety of interests and opinions : there is not a principle embodied in the whole of it . The Federalist is now generally regarded as an elaborate treatise , the best in existence on federal government , and so it is ; but its form is not by any means didactic . It is not written by men in the position of lawgivers , at whose feet their countrymen were reverentially seated . It is , on the contrary , simply an elaborate defence , by men of great powers , of a scheme which was evidently looked on by a large portion of the public with great distrust and misgiving . Every one of its papers consists of a series of answers to objections , of explanations and extenuations , showing that this or that provision was at least no worse or more dangerous than a similar one in the State Constitutions or in that of Great Britain ; that certain dreaded consequences would not result from the adoption of the new system ; and that , in any event , it would be a vast improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A very large portion of the work is devoted to showing that the grant of power to raise and maintain armies does not create a rule of military despotism ; that the grant of power to tax does not involve the risk of wholesale absorption of State property ; that the President is not a monarch in embryo ; that the Senate is not the germ of an oligarchy ; that small States will not be trampled on by hostile majorities in the House of Representatives ; that the possession of ' the treaty-making power by the President and Senate will not be likely to convert them into corrupt institutions of foreign intrigues against our commerce and independeuce . We are virtually told , in short , in every line of the work , that the authors of the Constitution might have done better if the passions and prejudices and weaknesses of the public had let them ; that the Constitution would remedy the evils under which the States were then suffering , in the old Coimfedcracy , and convert them from a jarring , confused mass of little Commonwealths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful , and respected nation ; but there is no trace of a belief that a blind adherence to its letter would keep them so forever . A singular notion has grown up in later days , that the Convention which framed the Constitution was guided , in draxving the line between the authority of the States and that of the United States , by the nature of things ; and that the amount of power which the members of the Confederation surrendered to the central authority was fixed by some fundamental principle of government . Two thirds of the clamor about encroachmnents on " the rights of States " is due to this fallacy . Its victims are possessed hy the belief , that , when the Colonies had secured their independence , they thereupon found themselves invested with a mysterious something called " sovereignty , " of which they can not get rid , even if they desire it , which sticks to them through all changes of men amid things , like orders to a priest , or divine righmt to a king , and with which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this theory , a certaimi number of the attributes of this sovereignty of which time State can divest itself temporarily , and from motives of comivenience , but which it can not wholly aliemmate , while // the power of resuming them can always be exercised at pleasure . The number and nature of these attributes that may thus be laid down are supposed to be fixed , not by expediency , but by certain eternal rules of right , which scem to have been revealed in early times to the founders of the government , who embodied their knowledge in the Federal Constitution . According to the school of political philosophers who support this theory , - and it is not a new school , - the American people exist for the purpose of maintaining and perpetuating this State sovereignty , just as , according to the disciples of Metternich , the raisor&amp; d ' *tre of the various European nations is the promotion of the grandeur and dignity of the reigning houses . These doctrines are not , as we have said , of recent origin . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eighty years ago as now , and the comments made on them at that time by Madison possess just as much point to-day as when they were uttered - " The adversaries to the plan of the Convention , instead of considering , in the first place , what degree of ' power was absolutely necessary for the purposes of the federal government , have exhausted themselves in a secondary inquiry into the possible consequences of the proposed degree of power to the governments of the particular States . But if the Union , as has been shown , be essential to the security of the people of America against foreign danger ; if it be essential to their security against contentions and wars among the different States ; if ' it be essential to guard them against those violent and oppressive factions which embitter the blessings of liberty , and against those military establishments which must gradually poison its very fountain ; if in a word , the Union be essential to the happiness of the people of America , is it not preposterous to urge as an objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union can not be attained , that such a government may derogate from the importance of the governments of the individual States ? Was , then , the American Revolution effected , was the American Confederacy formed , was the precious blood of ' thousands spilt , and the hard-earned substance of millions lavished , not that the people of America should enjoy peace , liberty , and safety ; but that the governments of the individual States , that particular municipal establishments , might enjoy a certain extent of power , and be ari'ayed with certain dignities and attributes of ' sovereignty ? We have heard of the impious doctrine in the Old World , that the people were made for kings , not kings // for the people . Is the same doctrine to be revived in the New , in another shape , that the solid happiness of the people is to be sacrificed to the views of political institutions of a different form ? It is too early for politicians to presume on our forgetting that the public good , the real welfare of the great body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursued ; and that no form of government whatever has any other value than as it may be fitted for the attainment of this object . Were the plan of the Convention adverse to the public happiness , my voice would be , Reject the plan . Were the Union itself inconsistent with the public happiness , it would be , Abolish the Union . In like manner , as far as the sovereignty of the States can not be reconciled to the happiness of the people , the voice of every good citizen must be , Let the former he sacrificed to the latter . How far the sacrifice is necessary , has been shown . How far the unsacrificed residue will be endangered , is the question before us. " * We have here the key to the problem before us . A state is a conventional arrangement , just as much as a confederacy or a kingdom . It exists for the purpose of promoting the happiness and prosperity of those who live in it , and for no other . If this purpose can be better served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the right , but the duty , of the people to merge it ; if by parting with one half , or two thirds , or three fourths of its sovereignty , it is their duty to part with one half , or two thirds , or three fourths , as the case may be . How much local power must be transferred to the central government in order to form a confederation , is a question which can not be decided by any general rule . Each case has to be settled on its own merits . How much may be safely granted , and how much ought to be retained , depends on the character , the training , antecedents , traditions , tendencies , and needs of the people for whose benefit the union is founded . All attempts to frame a formula on the subject are as certain to prove vain and fruitless , as the attempts which some political writers are constantly making to trace general limits for the province of government , - limits which must vary in different countries , as their civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly impracticable and injurious to leave to individual effort in Russia all that bad much better be left to individual effort in America ; // and official interference , or " initiative , " which in France acts as a wholesome tonic , would in England be simply a weakening irritant . The nearest approach which perhaps it is possible to make to a maxim for our use in the regulation of the relations between the States and the Union , will be found in the proposition , that whatever experience has shown to be necessary for the popular safety , comfort , and progress , had better , if it can not be or is not done by the individual States , be done by the general goveminent . That a State may safely part with its right of declaring war or making peace , of making treaties , of regulating commerce , of taxing imports , of exercising jurisdiction on the high seas , of coining money or creating orders of nobility , and can not part with anything else without danger to liberty , is a fiction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or experience . A very much smaller amount of local power and independence would render liberty safe in all contingencies , except those that may be called wildly remote , - such as the combination of the President , Congress , and army iii a gigantic conspiracy against the established Constitution . To develop and foster the spirit of local independence , however , to such a degree as to keep it constantly on the verge of anarchy , in order to guard against danger of this kind , is like always sleeping in one s clothes for fear of the house taking fire . The conduct of political as well as private life has to be arranged with reference to ordinary risks ; extraordinary ones must be left to that reserved fund of energy and courage which popular government , whether on a large or small scale , is sure to create . The whole doctrine of State sovereignty might be swept away to-morrow , the very remembrance that the States ever were sovereign might be wiped out , and our liberties would still be safe ; for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories of the origin and nature of our government , nor yet on the precise form of the government itself , that our possession of them depends . No people ever yet lost their freedom , except through foreign conquest , without either having ceased to care for it , or used it as an instrument for the oppression of others . Nations have been free under monarchies , as well as in republics . Our great safeguard against despotism does not lie , // and will never lie , wholly in the manner in which we parcel out power between the governing bodies , but in the character of the persons we charge with the management of our affairs , the spirit of those who choose them , the vigilance with which their acts are watched , and the boldness with which they are criticised . The Southern feeling of dissatisfaction with the Union was created by slavery , but the means to which the malecontents have resorted for giving vent to it have been provided by the doctrine of " State rights , " and by the centrifugal tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency has had most force at the South , but we have felt its effects at the North , as malaria shows itself in some persons in violent fever , and in others only in a lowered vitality . And it has been rendered all the more dangerous by changes which have been gradually taking place in the character of our population . New communities are springing up at the West every month , on whom the past has but little hold . They have no history , and no traditions . The great memories of the Revolution are far less potent swells in Iowa and Illinois than in Massachusetts . The West , in short , has inherited nothing , and so far from regretting this , it glories in it . One of the most marked results of that great sense of power by which it is pervaded , is its strong tendency to live in the future , to neglect the past . It proposes to make history , instead of reading it . It cares little , as yet , for the slow results of study , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short , for most of the tedious and painful processes by which the older world acquires capacity and arrives at results and conclusions . Individualism is cultivated in it to an extent which not simply diminishes respect for authority , but lessens the cohesive force of all relations , domestic , social , and political . It must not be forgotten , too , that though the movement in all countries towards assimilation of manners and customs and modes of thought is steady and rapid , and though the additions which science is every day making to our means of intercommunication are rendering the preserVation of all differences , at least in externals , more and more difficult , a nation which covers a whole continent , stretching through sixteen degrees of latitude , can never hope to be perfectly homogeneous . Differences // of soil and climate , involving as they do differences of diet and pursuits and habits , must in the long run produce differences of temperament , and differences of temperament produce differences of character . No community of origin , or language , or faith , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the burning sun of South Carolina or Texas from being in maiiy marked features a different man from him who toils among the snows of Minnesota or Vermont . The generations which grow up in the manufactories and seaports of New England wilt differ inevitably and materially from those which hold the plough in the wheat-fields of Illinois , or which watch their flocks on the pastures of the Great Plains . And when we add to the varieties of character thus created those which are likely to arise from the large infusion of foreign blood which we have already received and are daily receiving , ( the Irish and Germans in the United States numbered 3,000,000 in 1860 , ) and when we consider the immense area over which this vast sea of humanity - for vast it will be in a very few years , seething with energy , enterprise , eagerness , and hope-will be spread , to trouble ourselves about the risk of its complete subjection to the rule of one great central despotism seems about as sensible and as profitable as to sit down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal-fields are all exhausted , or that of providing for the increase of population when all arable lands have been brought under cultivation . No legislation and no political institutions will be able to efface all these differences , and reduce the whole populatioim of this continent to a single type , and no friend of either moral or material progress can wish that they should do so . Perfect uniformity is generally the forerunner of stagnation and decay . Our great danger lies in the exactly opposite direction . It may be safely affirmed , that all we can ever do to modify or efface the differences of interest and of character created by diversities of climate , soil , and situation will not be more than sufficient to keep us all bound up in the same political community ; and he must b* a sanguine man who , familiar with history and kimowing human nature , feels thoroughly assured that it will evemi be sufficient . There is one phenomenon in our politics , and a very striking // one , which , while it increases the danger of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean the gradual , and now all but complete , withdrawal from the State legislatures of our ablest and best men , and their absorption by the federal government . Few men of the highest distinction or capacity will now consent to serve the individual States as legislators . They either abstain from taking part in public affairs altogether , or reserve themselves for the arena at Washington ; or else , if they are not able to gratify their desire to get there at the outset of their career , generally manage to do so by the time they have acquired experience and training enough to render their services of much value . The work of local legislation is every day passing more and more into the hands of men of inferior character and capacity ; while the work to be done calls every day for a higher order of character and talent , owing to the growth of the community in every direction . The result is , that our State legislation is every year marked by increasing confusion , haste , ignorance , and corruption . The number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of acts plainly passed under corrupt influences ,  --  in many of the States , is becoming greater every session . We are thus losing one of the most valuable incidents of the State organization , the opportunity which it has afforded us of comparing and contrasting differeiit systems of legislation . There is clearly no instruction to be derived by other States from the working of laws which are passed , as they are in New York , at the rate of eight or ten a day , and are repealed or modified before they have been a year in operation . Such a thing as steady adherence to a policy long enongh to test its value , is now almost unknown . In fact , it is only on the slavery question that most of the States for some time past seem to have had a policy . With regard to all else , the course of their legislation is as erratic as the flight of a butterfly . The law of marriage and divorce , the law of inheritance , the law of debt , the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the first importance to society , are changed and rechanged , as if a fixed policy were a thing neither to be expected nor desired . That the public interests should , at least visibly , have suffered so little from this fickleness and eccentricity hitherto , can only // be accounted for byascribing it to the lightness of the public burdens , the extraordinary energy of the people , and the prodigious extent of our material resources . But the immense growth of our population and trade , and , above all , the responsibilities arising out of the war , have infused into all our relations , social , political , and commercial , a complexity , and even an intricacy , before unknown . We shall consequently need hereafter much closer attention to remote consequences , much greater delicacy of touch in the manipulation of social and political tendencies , much more thorough subordination of local to national interests , than has hitherto been either displayed or required . May we look for all these things to the State legislatures ? Will they prove equal to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the far greater strain which it is likely to impose on them hereafter ? We think not ; . an d we think not , while acknowledging to the fullest extent the value and the heartiness of the support which they have given to the national government during the war , and the vastness of the fund of energy which is developed by local independence , even in its most licentious forms . The attractive power exercised already by the federal centre , and which is daily increasing , will prevent it . As the Union grows in size and in the weight of its responsibility , each State sinks in importance , and the field offered to talent at Washington gains in width and in attractiveness . So that , as the years roll on , we may look for a greater and greater eagerness on the part of all mcii of political ambition to share in the administration of federal affairs , greater and greater reluctance to confine themselves within the narrow and obscure sphere which State politics will offer to their activity . As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large army and a large navy in motion , to whose debates the civilized world listens with anxiety , which regulates the expenditure of one of the largest revenues ever raised , which , in short , holds the whole force of " a mighty and puissant nation " in its hands , all the brain and ambition of the country will gravitate to it as surely , and by a law as irresistible , as that by which an apple falls to the ground . And there is nothing more certain than that the habit of dealing with large interests enlarges the understanding , // sharpens the perception , deepens the insight , steadies the judgment , strengthens the purpose , and gives the intellectual vision a wider range . The national government will , from the very nature of its work , always be animated by a higher sense of duty , less influenced by prejudices and passions , more anxious about distant results , and therefore more conservative , than any State legislature can be . Such scandals as the late act of the New York legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt to foreign creditors in depreciated currency , will , we venture to say , never be witnessed in Washington ; not perhaps altogether because the national legislators are either wiser or better than those of the State , bitt because the worst men are apt to be improved , and the giddiest men sobered , by finding themselves armed with vast power , and burdened with heavy responsibilities . A common regard for our own safety would seem to require , therefore , that the division of power between the State and central governments should now undergo careful revision , and that it should be redistributed under the guidance of that experience of our wants and dangers which we have derived from the history of the last eighty years . Eighty years would in the life of many other nations be but a brief epoch ; the last eighty years have , in our national life , been an age , and yet we are but on the threshold of our career . Great as have been the changes and modifications of all kinds , social , political , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , they open a vista of vaster changes still to come , for which , if we are wise , we shall begin to prepare while it is yet time . We have seen just enough of the working of democratic government to know that we have not by any means hit upon a perfect form of it ; and , as long as the country is undergoing the great modifications necessarily attendant upon rapid growth , we may rest satisfied we shall not arrive at any final conclusions as to what the perfect form is . That consummation is reserved for a still far distant age and generation . All we can do in the mean time is to persist in the only course of experiment which is in politics either possible or expedient , and which consists in the application of such remedies as are within our reach to such evils as may from time to time show themselves . // To glance at all the possible dangers of our present position , at all the tendencies in our political and social progress , which need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volume , instead of an article , would be necessary . Some few of them , however , stand out in marked prominence . We may well ask ourselves whether , iii the face of what is now passing before our eyes , the national government needs nothing more for the protection of the national life than the power of raising and equipping fleets and armies , and of punishing pirates and counterfeiters of the public money . It is quite clear that federal authority might be in full and vigorous enjoyment of all the powers conceded to it by the Constitution , and the nation might still perish of dry-rot . For the dangers we have most to fear are not the arms of either foreign enemies or domestic traitors . Nothing can keep the national government together , but the general diffusion of education amongst those who live under it . It has no foe so terrible as popular ignorance , and yet against this one it can not raise a finger . Whatever helps to lessen the popular appreciation of the value of liberty , to magnify in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones , to influence local jealousy , to raise the town or the State above the nation , to diminish the popular respect for justice and for individual rights , to cherish the bigotry of class , or creed , or race , will do more to split the United States into warring fi*agu*eiits , to destroy all that is grand , ennobling , and hopeful in our career and prospects , than all the monarchies or oligarchies on earth are capai ) le of effecting . One main source from which these dangers spring is ignorance . It is to the ignorance of the Southern people that we owe the rebellion ; to the ignorance of the great masses of the Northern people that we owe much of the baseness and corruption which sully our political life ; to the ignorance of the Irish , that we owe two thirds of our crime ; and if we ever become the prey of a despot , it will be because ignorance will have rooted out from the popular heart the love of rational freedom . In short , there is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy may not sink ; there is hardly any attainable height of prosperity and happiness to which an intelligent and enlightened democracy may not rise . If we should ever // succeed - and there is no reason why we should not - in carrying a sound and efficient system of popular education wherever the national flag waves ,  --  in placing our whole population on the same plane in this respect , for instance , with Massachusetts , - we might rest assured that we had created a nation against which the gates of hell could not prevail . And yet , in spite of all this , the national government , whose very existence is imperilled by the failure of the individual States to teach their citizens , is compelled to stand with folded arms until their ignorance has borne fruit in treason or riot . It may then move , but only to shoot or bayonet . Would it not be wiser , as well as juster and more humane , to give it the power , and not only this , but to make it its duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indolence or indiffereii6'e , false economy or sheer malevolence , fail to do so ? If , in short , the safety of the nation depends on the education of the people , ought not the education of the people to be made a national concern ? Is there not something suicidal in the obligation now resting on the national government and national courts to uphold and respect a State law , which , as in most of the Slave States , condemns half its population to dwell in the blackest mental night ? As if the evil bred in this midnight darkness could , when it burst its barriers , destroy nobody but its authors ; as if it were possible , when the Devil was let loose in South Carolina , to guarantee that he should not extend his ravages to New York or Massachusetts . Next to education , there is in a democratic country nothing of such vast political as well as social importance as the mar riage contract , - the way in which it is entered into , the way in which it may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The family is the basis of civil society . its protection *s , in fact , the great end of government ; the bulwarks which are thrown round it , either by law or custom , affect the national life and character perhaps more than all other influences put together . More than one great thinker on the Continent has ascribed the political misfortunes and the moral decline which have overtakeii what is called the " Latin race , " to the fact that it continues to regard marriage as a bargain , and denies to at least one of the parties all free agency in the most // solemn and important of contracts ; and it is certain that iiothing ever brings two peoples into closer relations , gives each a better understanding of the other 's ideas , each a deeper sympathy with the weak as well as the strong points of the other 's character , than a community of ideas and customs with regard to marriage . To make love in the same manner , utter the marriage vow in the same spirit , put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same eyes on its breach , be bound by the same rules with regard to its dissolution , constitute between communities , as between individuals , one of the strongest ties , - one that political separation or opposing interests are insufficient to sever . This is , of course , the sentimental side of the matter ; but if we look at it from a legal point of view , its importance rather increases than diminishes . There is no hum*ux relation which affects the distribution and transmission of property more powerfully than marriage . The family is , of course , not only the channel along which property passes from generation to generation , but furnishes the most powerful of all stimulants to industry and accumulation . Whatever affects its stability , therefore , naturally and irresistibly exercises , in. the long run , a greater or less influence on the national wealth . Now nothing affects its stability more seriously than the law of divorce . If the law of divorce be too lax , it may deprive the marriage contract of all sanctity , by making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; if too strong , it may convert it in vast numbers of cases into a fountain of bitterness and demoralization . We have not space to enter into such an elucidation of these points as they merit , but a moment 's reflection on them will be sufficient to convince any intelligent person that a uniform law of marriage and divorce is one of the essential bases of real national unity ; and yet it is one which this nation does not possess . In other words , the national governuient is deprived of all support from one of the strongest of the social forces . The whole matter is left by the Constitution in the hands of the State legislatures , and , as might be expected , their action has resulted in producing the widest diversity in the laws of marriage and divorce in different States . If we // are not mistaken , there are not more than three States in the Union in which the same form of marriage is binding ; we doubt if there are two in which divorces are granted for the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result is , that an American citizen may be in one part of his country living in lawful wedlock , but if he cross a line , perhaps half a mile away , he becomes a bigamist , and his children are made illegitimate , and incapable , if he dies intestate , of inheriting his property . The absurdities and wrongs which arise , or may arise , out of the existing state of the law , are innumerable ; and that it is not felt to be a greater hardship is a proof of the popular ignorance of the evil that results from it . Many of the States legislate on this subject with a levity which might seem to indicate a desire to bring marriage itself into contempt . The facility with which marriage may be dissolved in portions of the West may well he called scandalous , and we wish it were only scandalous . Other illustrations might be produced , of the dangers to natioiiai unity arising out of the present division of powers between the Federal and State governments ; but we hope we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revision of the Constitution as shall adapt it to the altered circumstances of the country , - its new wants and new dangers . The people have given , during the past three years , too many and too convincing proofs of their appreciation of the Union , to allow us to suppose that they will be deterred by either names or traditions from making any changes that are plainly called for by the public " safety , honor , and welfare . " Where blood has been so freely offered , prejudices are but a small sacrifice , and no sacrifice can be too great that may be required to make and to keep this Union indissoluble . If the Union were only to secure to the inhabitants of North America internal peace and freedom of internal trade , it would do more for civilization and for human happiness than any other political organization which has ever existed ; and yet these , we need hardly say , are among the least of the blessings which , if it be maintained , strengthened , and perpetuated , it will secure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
