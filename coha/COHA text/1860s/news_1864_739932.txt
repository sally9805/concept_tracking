txt The 22d day of February was celebrated in this city by a variety of events that certainly mark an era in its history , and will be always remembered by those who passed through the varied excitements with unusual pleasure . The day was one of the finest that ever dawned upon the earth , and after the unseasonable cold , was therefore doubly enjoyed . At an early hour the people were astir to witnessihe parade and hear the grand concert to come off at the head of Canal-street . Long before the hour set for them in the programme , the wide street was densely thronged from Camp to the levee . The Custom-house and every other available place were literally covered over with spectators , including large numbers of ladies . Just above the Custom-house was erected a large stand , on which were stationed the members of several of our best military bands , formed for the moment In an immense orchestra of instrumental music . At the intersection of Tchapitoulas-street with Canal was a park of forty pieces of artillery loaded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could be fired as , the base notes of the rolling music . The first piece was appropriately " Hall Columbia , " and we never heard it given with more effect . As one note after another of that swelling anthem struck the ears of the enthusiastic listeners , the crowd gradually assumed a perfect silence . The ladies convulsively kept tune with their hangfi , fife gentlemen 's eyes glistened , and the bronzed veterans present of the Department of the Gulf wore a more fierce and martial aspect . Amid this profound moment of interest , as the speaking harmony swelled and reverberated even across the glorious Mississippi , the climax was reached by the sudden belching forth of the artillery , Us roar mingling at last in one grand combination , made up of music , the artillery and the cheers of the enthusiastic crowd . A number of pieces followed , the most noticeable of which was the " Storm Gallop , ' in which the soldiers of Col. DUDLEY 'S Cavalry Brigade gave great effect by their hearty cheering , the charge or battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a finale furioso , in which our national airs mingled with those of other nations , the whole ending with the rapid discnarge of the artillery . This novel concert , and most appropriate celebration of WasnuraTON 'S birthday , consumed nearly two hours . There were present on the stand Maj , - Gen . BANKS , his staff , and most of the distinguished officers of the department , as well as a large number of our most influential citizens . Meantime the city was made lively by another , and , for practical purposes , a more important proceeding . The loyal voters of Louisiana were at the polls using their prerogative for the selection of a civil Governor , the first to be elected in a rebel State . It was due to Louislanalo thus lead off in the great work of restoration . Forced by political traitors against the wishes of her people dut of the Union , under the protecting aegis of the Federal power , she hastens back under the folds of the Stars and Stripes , setting an example soon to be followed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by all the remainder of the States now held by a military despotism as part of the Confederate States . The moral of this election in a thousand ways will tell for good at home and abroad . It will satisfy foreign statesmen that the hearts of the people were never prepared for rebellion . It will close the mouths of the slanderers of the London Time* and kindred sheets , in their constant assertions that the people of the South do not wish to return to the Union . It has settled the matter that the people of at least one , and that the extremest Southern State except one , will accept a Free State Constitution as a basis of their future existence in the Union ; for this feature , by accidental circumstances , has been most prominently Drought before the voters , and has been decided upon with a pronounced manner that can not be misunderstood . The able leader which appeared in your paper some weeks ago , upon the announcement that a negro delegation bad been admitted to the floor of a pointcal convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as offensive against society and good government , has been responded to by this election ; and in addition , the Conservative , or , if you please . the Copperhead ticket , also had its fair presentation , also to be signally condemned  --  the voters wisely steering between the two extremes , accepting a Free-State Constitution as a basis of action , untainted by ultra Abolitionism or incipient sympathy with the spirit of the rebellion . There were three candidates before the people  --  Mr. Flume , the Conservative ; Mr. FLANDERS , the Ultra , and Mr. Heim the consistent friend of a free Constitution . By an examination of the election returns , the most casual reader will perceive the exact state of public sentiment here , and will , if truly patriotic , rejoice at the healthy tone of public sentiment , for the election of Mr. Herm is a measure of a practical character , and of great future consequences for good in its example to the rebel States , as well as at the North , that can hardly be too much appreciated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the State of Louisiana would be better off with a free Constitution , and relieved of the degrading influences of Slayers ' , and that while they have no sympathy with radical measures looking In the future to negro equality , they also emphatically condemn any party that looks to the restoration of half-way measures in favor of Slavery , that would in the most easy Manner be made a stepping stone in due time for the restoration of Slavery and the return to the " black code , " All honor to Louisiana ; she has again assumed , by her regenerated position , her place as the real keystone of the arch of the cotton-growing States . In this connection , I should be derelict of duty if I did not record how much the country is indebted to Maj.-Gen . BANKS for the manner he has treated the entire preliminaries of the campaign . His proclamation , ordering the election , was , and has been , the keynote of all subsequent action , and all " orders " he has issued since have tended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has with singular success kept aloof from all questions that were calculated to complicate or embarrass the real objects of the election , viz. : the restoration of the State into the hands of those who stood pledged to Mr. ** proclamations , arm he has done this , not by any exertion of his supreme military authority , but by simply setting the example of right , and then trusting to the good sense of the people , left them to follow , and they have justified his faith , and he can look at the result as a proud triumph of intellect and patriotism over fanaticism on one side and a destructive conservatism on the other . In no trying position of Gen. BANKS ' public life , not even in his contest for Speaker , did his eminent civil qualities as a statesman and executive show more brilliantly . In analysing the imperfect election returns , we learn the gratifying fact that twice as many votes for Governer were cast as were necessary to meet the requirements of Mr. LINCOLN 'S Proclamation  --  the number required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Congressional election within the Parish of Orleans a year ago , which resulted in the return of Messrs . HAHN. and FLANDERS , there were cast 5,280 votes , at this present election 5,811 votes were cast within the same district , showing a gain of 529 votes in twelve months ; the enormous gains have been made in the country R hid ) has been opened up for the holding of an election . Louisiana , in 1860 , cast a little over 30,000 votes , ' and by examining the general returns it ? will be perceived that wherever an election was held the aggregate number of votes cast was equal to the election of 1860 . The polls closed at 4 o'clock , and ere the hour of seven arrived the people were crazy with the returns that announced the glorious victory which had been achieved , as three precious hours of the eventful day stilt remained to prepare for the grand masquerade which Mrs. Gov . BANKS offered to the elite of our Population as a proper conclusion of the glorious festivities of the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building for the occasion was most profusely decorated with flags , and further ornamented with a magnificent gas jet , forming the name of WASHINGTON . Two splendid bands , one in the second gallery , and one in the rear or the stage , discoursed the music , alternately relieving each other . At 10 o'clock , the streets were alive with carriages , the occupants in the varied and gay dresses glistening most picturesquely in the bright moonlight , while onithe pavements long processions might be seen of ladies and gentlemen masked , wending their way to the Opera House . New-Orleans looked for the time like an Italian city , rather than like an American city . All was joyous , the ladies delighted with the novelty of the affair . the gentlemen additionally exultant from the now officially announced Free State victory . ? Entering the Opera House , the guests , ascending the steps , entered the building , and finally reached the first tier of boxes , where the centre of the front had been removed , and a platform erected reaching over the parquette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor of the ball-room . On the stage stood Mrs. Gen , BANKS , the hostess of the evening , dressed as a lady of the era of Loom XIII. , supported on the right by a lady in the dress familar to the dames of uor first revolutionary rperiod , and here suppo rted by Gen. BANKS , she received her guests , with a dignity and ease that charmed the immense throng present . The entire affair was a most brilliant success . The boxes were crowded with elegantly dressed spectators , the floor was overflowing with the maskers . I was glad to see in the throng many representatives of our most ari , tocratic old families . They-have withstood all inducements to be friendly and accept the Federal rule , with the fascinations of social and elegant eatertainments , under the patronage of Mrs. BANKS , brought them from their seclusion . In conversation with a gentleman present , prominent in society here for the last twenty-five years , he was forced to admit that the Crescent City , in her palmiest days , never gave so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in costume , and distinguished for its guests , as this closing fete of the celebration of WASHINGTON 'S Birthday of New-Orleans.
