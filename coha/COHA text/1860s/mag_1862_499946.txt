J ? eeotlection8 of Tha81dngto* Irving . RECOLLECTIONS OF WASHINGTON IRVING . BY ONE OF HIS FRIENDS . THE appearance of the first volume of the long-expected L ' *fe of W*tshington Irving has excited an interest which will not be satisfied until the whole work shall have been completed . Its author , Pierre M. Irving , sets forth with the announcement that his plan is to make the patriarch of American literature his own biographer . It is nothing new that this branch of letters is beset with peculiar difficulties . Some men suffer sadly at the hand of their chronicler . Scott misrepresents Napoleon , and Southey fails equally in his Memoirs of Cowper and of the Wesleys . Friendship 's colors are too bright for correct portraiture , and prejudice equally forbids acuracy . Mr. Pierre M. Irving , though an admirer of his distinguished kinsman , ( and who that knew him could fail of admiration ? ) avoids the character of a mere eulogist , while at the same time he exhibits none of the obsequiousness of a Boswell , fluttering like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of independent mind and of high culture , he brings out the character he portrays in aspects true to life , and not exaggerated by excess of tone , while he fully exhibits its exquisite finish . Among the many incidents of deep interest which are contained in this volume , the episode of Matilda Hoffman stands forth in most striking relief . While lifting the veil which for a halfcentury covered the most pathetic event in Irving 's life , his biographer touches with a scrupulous delicacy a theme so sacredly enshrined in a life-long memory . In referring to this affair , which gave a tender aspect to Irving 's subsequent career , and in fact changed its whole tenor , we may remark that the loves of literary men form a most interesting and , in some cases , moving history . Some , like Petrarch , Earl Surrey , Burns , and Byron , have embalmed the objects of their affection in the effusions of their muse , while others have bequeathed that duty to others . Shakspeare says but little about his sweetheart , while Milton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems to have acted on the motto , The least said , the soonest mended . ' Poor Pope , miserable invalid though he was , nervous , irritable , and full of hate and spleen , was not beyond the power of the tender passion , and confessed the charms of the lovely Martha Blount , who held the wretched genius among her conquests . Swift , although an ogre at heart , had his chapter of love matters , which never fail to give us the horrors when we bring them to mind , and the episodes of Stella and Yanessa are among the minor tragedies in life 's great drama . Johnson had a great heart , and was born to love , though , like the lion , he needed to have his claws pared , to fit him for female society . What a tender attachment was that which he bore Tetty , ' and with what solemn remembrance he preserved her as his own , even after death had robbed him of her presence ! The loves of these men exercised the strongest influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappointment and consequent celibacy have done the same to their victims . To the bachelor list of modern days , which can boast of Charles Lamb and Macaulay , America adds the proud name of Washington Irving , whose early disappointment made him an author . My impressions of Irving 's boyhood and youth are alive with the freshness of an early memory , which conserves along with him the Crugers , Clintons , Livingstons , Ogdens , and other old and honored names of New-York . The biography which inspires this reminiscence gives a sketch of the early history of // the family , and as its author has thus opened the subject , it will not , we presume , be considered an intrusion if I pursue the thread of domestic incident a little farther than he has done . The Irving homestead , in William street , was , in its day , a place of some pretension , when contrasted with the humble dwellings which surrounded it . The street on which it stood was miserably built , but here , in the suburb of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid and hightoned character of its owner . Old Mr. Irving was , at the time to which I refer , a hale citizen of about three-score and ten , of grave and majestic bearing , and a form and expression which , when once fixed in the mind , coi*ld not easily be forgotten . As I remember him , his countenance was cast in that strong mould which characterized the land of his birth , but the features were often m*llowed by a quiet smile . He was a man of deep piety , and was esteemed a pillar in the Brick Chui-ch , then the leading Presbyterian church of the city . His mode of conducting family worship was peculiarly beautiful , and even to his last days he maintained this service . On such occasions , it was a most touching spectacle to see the majestic old man , bowed and hoary with extreme age , leaning upon his staff ; as he stood among his family and sung a closing hymn , generally one appropriate to his condition , while tears of emotion ran down his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It runs in these lines Death may dissolve my body now , And bear my spirit home ; Why do my moments move so slow , Nor my salvation come ? With heavenly weapons I have fought The battles of my Lord ; Finished my course , and kept the faith , And wait the sure reward . ' In a few years , the words of this exquisite hymn were fulfilled ; the old man fell asleep , full of years and of honors , going to the grave like a shock of corn in its season . His funeral was . Recollection8 of Tha8ldngtrn Irving . one of imposing simplicity , and he was buried just at the entrance of that church where he had been so long a faithful attendant . Mrs. Irving , who survived him several years , was of a different type of character , which , by its peculiar contrast , seemed to perfect the harmony of a well-matched union . She was of elegant shape , with large English features , which were permeated by an indescribable life and beauty . Her manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high order . All of these graces appeared in the children , and were united with the vigor of intel . lect which marked the character of the father . It would have been surprising if the offspring of such a union should not have been distinguished , and it is only the peculiar relation which the biographer sustains to it which prevents him from bringing this feature out more prominently . It was , however , acknowledged , at an early day , that the family of William Irving had no equal in the city , and when we consider its number , its personal beauty , its moral excellence , its varied talents , without a single deficient or unworthy member , we can not wonder at the general admiration which it commanded . From the eldest son , William , and Ann , the eldest daughter , whom her father fondly termed Nancy , to Washington , the youngest , all were endowed with beauty , grace , amiability , and talent , yet in the latter they seemed to effloresce with culminating fullness . Nancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future destiny many a youth might have confessed an impassioned interest . Her brother William had become connected commercially with a young revolutionary soldier , ( General Dodge , ) who had opened a trading-station on the Mohawk frontier , and the latter bore away the sister as his bride . The union was one of happiness , and lasted twenty years , when it was terminated by her death . Of this , Washipgton thus speaks , in a S // letter in 1808 : On thc road* as I was traveling in high spirits , with the idea of home to inspire me , I had the shock of reading an account of my dear sister 's death , and never was a blow struck so near my heart before . ' . . . One more heart lies cold and still that ever beat toward me with the warmest affection , for she was the tenderest , best of sisters , and a woman of whom a brother might be proud . ' Little did the author of this letter then dream of that more crushing blow which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from whose weight he was never wholly to recover . William Irving , the brother of the biographer , was a model of manly beauty , and early remarkable for a brilliant and sparkling intellect , which overflowed in conversation , and often bordered on eloquence . Had he been bred to the law , he would have shone among its brightest stars ; but those gifts , which so many envied , were buried in trade , and though he became one of the merchant-princes of the city , even this success could not compensate for so great a burial of gifts . As one of the contributors to Salmagundi , he exhibits the keenness of a flashing wit , while , in subsequent years , he represented New-York in Congress , when such an office was a distinction . Peter Irving , like his brother , united personal elegance with talents , and conducted the ffornin*g Chronicle , amid the boisterous storms of early politics . This journal favored the interests of Burr ; but it must be remernberbd that at that time Burr 's name was free from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed the highest prestige , being the centre of the Democracy of New-York . Burr 's powers of fascination were peculiarly great , and he had surrounded himself with a circle of enthusiastic admirers . Indeed , such was his skill in politics , that in 1800 he upset the Federalists , after a pitched battle of three days , ( the old duration of an election , ) which was one of the*most excfting scenes I ever witnessed . Horatio Gates , of Saratoga fame , was one of his nominees for the State Legislature , ( Gates was then enjoying those undeserved laurels which posterity has since taken away , ) and it was surprising to see the veterans of the Revolution abandoning their party to vote for their old comrade and leader . The result was , that the Federalists were most thoroughly worsted , and the party never recovered from the blow . Such were the exciting events which identified the young politicians of the metropolis , and which inspired their speeches and their press . Burr 's headquarters * were at Martling 's Tavern , 87 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was removed to Tammany Hall , which has inherited a political character from its predecessor . Besides this , he used to meet his friends in more select numbers at a Coffee-house in Maiden Lane . His office was Number 30 Partition street , ( now Fulton , ) and his residence was at Richmond Hill . This place has lately been pulled down ; it stood far away from the city , in a wild , secluded neighborhood , and in bad going was quite an out of the way spot , though noW it would be in the densest part of the city . As there were no public vehicles plying in this direction , except the Chelsea ( Twenty-eighth street ) stage , which was very unreliable , one either had to hire a coach or else be subjected to a walk of two miles . But such as had the entrie of this establishment would be well rewarded , even for these difficulties , by an interview with Theodosia Burr , the most charming creature of her day . She was married early , and we saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irvings felt in Burr 's fortunes , it might have been expected that they should sympathize with him in his subsequent reverses . The biographer presents Washington Irving as an attendant at the famous trial at Richmond , where his indignation at some of Burr 's privations are expressed in a most interesting letter . This sympathy is the more touching from the fact that Washington was a Federalist , and in this respect differed from his brothers . We have an idea that his youthful politics were in no small de 691 // gree influenced by those of that illustrious personage for whom he was named . Another of the sons was John T. , who became a successful and wealthy jurist , and for many years presided at NewYork Common Pleas , while Ebenezer was established in trade at an early day . Such was the development of that family , which in rosy childhood followed William Irving to the old Brick Church , and whose early progress he was per mitted to witness . The biographer passes lightly over the scenes of boyhood , and there was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youngest . He was no doubt the first child ever named after the father of his country , and the touching incident of Lizzie 's presenting the chubby , bright-eyed boy to Washington , is hit off in a few touches . It was , however , in itself a sublime thing . Nearly seventy years afterward , that child , still feeling the hand of benediction resting upon him , concludes his Life of Washington by a description of his reception in New-York , ' of which he had been a witness . Why does he not ( it would have been a most pardonable allusion ) bring in the incident referred to above * Ah ! modesty forbade ; yet , as he penned that description , his heart must have rejoiced at the boldness of the servant who broke through the crowd and presented to the General a boy honored with his name . Glorious incident in-deed ! As the family grew up , the young men took to their different professions , which we have briefly designated . Peter read medicine , and hence received the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abjured it , yet , as early as 1794 , he had opened an office at 208 Broadway . This , however , was more a resort for the muses than for llygeia , notwithstanding its sign , Peter Irving , M.D. ' In 1796 , William Irving , who had been clerk in the loan office , established himself in trade in Pearl - near Partition - street , and from his energy and elegance of manners , he became immediately successful , while farther up the street , near Old Slip , John T. opened a law office , which was subsequently removed to Wall street , near Broadway . We mention these facts to show that Irving entered life surrounded by protecting influences , and that the kindness which sheltered him from the world 's great battle had a tendency to increase his natural delicacy and to expose him to more intense suffering , when the hand of misfortune should visit him . One who had roughed it ' with the world would have better borne the killing disappointment of his affections ; but he was rendered peculiarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets off in remarkable contrast , the noble resolution with which such an one as he , when he had buried all the world held in the tomb with the dead form of his beloved , rose above his sorrows . It is well observed by his biographer , that it is an affecting evidence how little Mr. Irving was ever disposed to cultivate or encourage sada ness , that he should be engaged during this period of sorrow and seclusion in revising and giving additional touches to his History of New- York . ' Those who may smile at the elegant humor which pervades the pages of that history , will be surprised to learn that they were nearly complete , yet their final revision and preparation for the press was by one who was almost broken of heart , and who thus cultivated a spirit of cheerfulness , lest he should become a burden ' to himself and others . As he writes to Mrs. Hoffman : By constantly exercising my mind , never suffering it to prey upon itself and resolutely determining to be cheerful , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enviable state of serenity and self-possession . How truly has Wordsworth expressed this idea : If there be one who need bemoan Ills kindred laid in earth , The household hearts that were his own , It is the man of mirth . ' We are glad to know that in time Irving sought a better consolation . 692 // But to return from this digression , or rather anticipation of our subject . At the time of which we now write , NewYork was comparatively a small town ; true , it was the chief commercial city in America , and yet its limits proper could be described by a line drawn across the island some distance below Canal street . Yet even then New-York was full of life , and seemed to feel the promise of subsequent greatness . Her streets echoed to the footsteps of men whom the present generation , with all its progress , can not surpass . At Number 26 Broadway , might have been daily seen the light-built but martial and elegant form of Alexander Hamilton , while his mortal foe , Aaron Burr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Partition street . John Jacob Astor was just becoming an established and solid business man , and dwelt at 223 Broadway , the present site of the Astor House , and which was one of the earliest purchases which led to the greatest landed estate in America . Robert Lenox lived in Broadway , near Triuity Church , and was building up that splendid commerce which has made his son one of the chief city capitalists . De Witt Clinton was a young and ambitious lawyer , full of promise , whose office ( he was just elected Mayor ) was Number 1 Broadway . Cadwallader B. Colden was pursuing his brilliant career , and might be found immersed in law at Number 59 Wall street . Such were the legal and political magnates of the day ; while to slake the thirst of their excited followers , Medcef Eden brewed ale in Gold street , and Janeway carried on the same business in Magazine street ; and his empty establishment became notorious , in later years , as the Old Brewery . ' About this time young Irving was developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His manners were soft without being effeminate , his form finely molded , and his countenance singularly beautifuL To this might be added the general opinion that he was considerably gifted in the use of the pen . Yet with all these promising fea tures , the future was clothed with shadows , for his health was failing , and his friends considered him too lovely a flower to last . Little did his brothers and sisters think that that delicate youth would , with one exception , outlive the whole family . It was at this time that he first went abroad ; and his experiences of travel are given by Pierre Irving in the sparkling letters which he wrote to his brothers . In 1807 I used to meet him once more in social gatherings in the city , for he had returned in full restoration of health , his mind expanded , and his manners improved by intercourse with the European world , while Salmczgundi had electrified the city and given him the first rank among its satirists . The question of profession crowded on him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in either of which he might find one or more of his brothers . The former of these was a road to distinction , the latter was one to wealth ; but feeling the absence of practical business gifts , he shrank from trade , and took refuge in the quiet readings of an office . Josiah Ogden Hoffman , of whose daughter so much has recently been written , was a family friend , as well as a lawyer of high character . He lived first at Number 68 Greenwich strcet , but afterward moved up-town , his office being in Wall street , first Number 47 , and afterward Number 16 . Young Irving finished his studies with Mr. Hoffman , and immediately took office with his brother John , at Number 3 Wall street . To these two was soon added the presence of Peter , who was still connected with the press , and thus might have been found for a short time a most interesting and talented , as well as fraternal trio . Washington was still , to a considerable degree an habitui of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one who was so dull at reading law that he makes merry with his own deficiencies , should have a connection with two offices . But the name of Matilda was the magnet which drew him to one where 693 // he vainly struggled to climb Alp on Alp of difficulties in hope of love 's fruition , while at the other he might smile at the bewilderments of Coke , brush away the cobwebs from his brain , and recreate himself with the rich humors of Salmctgundi . The place and time where this remarkable attachment had its indeption , are not known ; but like all such affairs , it arose , no doubt , from felicitous accident . In one of his sketches , Irving speaks of a mysterious footprint seen on the sward of the Battery , which awoke a romantic interest in his breast . This youthful incident comes to our mind when we remember that Mr. Hoffman lived at Number 68 Greenwich street , not a stone 's throw from the Battery , and we have sometimes thought that the mysterious footprint might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that day a place of fashionable resort , and hence the fair but fragile form of Matilda Hoffman could almost any day have been seen tripping among bevies of city girls in pursuit of health or pleasure . But whatever be the history of its origin , the attachment became one of mutual strength ; and while young Irving was surrounded by piles of lawbooks and red tape , his hope of success was identified with the name of Matilda . My remembrance of Matilda ( her name was Sarah Matilda , but the first was dropped in common intercourse ) revives a countenance of great sweetness , and an indescribable beauty of expression . Her auburn hair played carelessly in the wind , and her features , though not of classic outline , were radiant with life . Her eye was one of the finest I have ever seen - rich , deep-toned and eloquent , speaking , volumes in each varying expression , and generally suggestive of pensive emotion . Irving was about eight years her senior , and this difference was just sufficient to drawout that fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth in the sketch of The Wife . ' The brief period of this courtship was the sunny hour of his life , for his tender and sensitive na ture forbade any thing but the most ardent attachment . What dreams of future bliss floated before his intoxicated vision , soon to change to the stern realities of grieving sorrow ! In 1809 , Mr. Hoffman removed to a suburban residence in Broadway , ( corner of Leonard street , ) and the frequent walks which the young lover took up that sequestered avenue may have suggested some of the descriptions of the same street in the pages of the History of New - York , and his allusions to the front - gardens so adapted to ancient courtship . While at this mansion , amid all the blandishments of hope , Matilda 's health began to fail beyond the power of restoratives , and the anxious eye both of parent and betrothed , marked the advance of relentless disease . The maiden faded away from their affcctions until both stood by her bed and saw her breathe her last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was found in a repository of which he always kept the key , a memorial of this affair , which had evidently been written to some friend , in explanation of his single life . Of the memorial the following extract is given : We saw each other every day , and I became excessively attached to her . Her shyness wore off by degrees . The more I saw of her the more I had reason to admire her . Her mind seemed to unfold itself leaf by leaf* and every time to discover new sweetness . Nobody knew her so well as I , for she was generally timid and silent , but I , in a manner , studied her excellence . Never didlmeet more intuitive rectitude of mind , more native delicacy , more exquisite propriety in word , thought , or action , than in this young creature . I am not exaggerating ; what I say was acknowledged by all who knew her . Her brilliant little sister used to say that people began by admiring her , but ended by loving Matilda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at times rebuked by her superior delicacy and purity , as if I was a coarse , unworthy being , in comparison . This passion was terribly against my studies . I felt my own deficiency , and despaired of ever succeeding at the bar . I could study any thing else rather than law , and had a fatal propensity to belles-lettres . // I had gone on blindly like a boy in love , but now I began to open my eyes and be miserable . I had nothing in purse or in expectation . I anticipated nothing from my legal pursuits , and had done nothing to make me hope for public employment , or political elevation . I had begun a satirical and humorous work , ( The llistory of New - York , ) in company with one of my brothers ; but he had gone to Europe shortly after commencing it , and my feelings had run in so different a vein that I could not go on with it . I became low-spirited and disheartened , and did not know what was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to the law ; but it is a slow and tedious undertaking for a young man to get intopractice , and I had , unluckily , no turn for business . The gentleman with whom I studied saw the state of my mind . He had an affectionate regard for me  --  a paternal one , I may say . He had a better opinion of my legal capacity than it merited , lie urged me to return to my studies , to apply myself , to become well acquainted with the law , and that in case * could make myself capable of undertaking legal concerns , he would take me into partnership with him and give me his daughter . Nothing could be more generous . I set to work with zeal to study anew , and I considered myself bound in honor not to make farther advances with the daughter until I should feel satisfied with my proficiency with the law . It was all in vain . I had an insuperable repugnance to the study ; my mind would not take hold of it ; or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable of any application . I was in a wretched state of doubt and selfdistrust . I tried to finish the work which I was secretly writing , hoping it would give me reputation and gain me some pbblic employment . In the mean time I saw Matilda every day , and that helped distract me . In the midst of this struggle and anxiety , she was taken ill with a cold . Nothing was thought of it at first , but she grew rapidly worse , and fell into a consumption . I can not tell you what I suffered . The ills that I have undergone in this life have been dealt out to me drop by drop , and I have tasted all their bitterness . I saw her fade rapidly away - beautiful and more beautiful , and more angelic to the very last . I was often by her bedside , and in her wandering state of mind she would talk to me with a sweet , natural , and affecting eloquence that was overpowering . I saw more of the beauty of her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her malady was rapid in its career , and hurried her off in two months . Her dying-struggles were painful and protracted . For three days and nights I did not leave the house , and scarcely slept . I was by her when she died . All the family were assembled around her , some praying , others weeping , for she was adored by them all . I was the last one she looked upon . I have told you as briefly as I could , what , if I were to tell with all the incidents and feelings that accompanied it , would fill volumes . She was but seventeen years old when she died . I-can not tell you what a horrid state of mind I was in for a long time . I seemed to care for nothing ; the world was a blank to me . I abandoned all thoughts of the law . I went into the country , but could not bear solitude , yet could not enjoy society . There was a dismal horror continually on my mind that made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in the night and seek the bedroom of my brother , as if the having of a human being by me would relieve me from the frightful gloom of my own thoughts . Months elapsed before my mind would resume any tone , but the despondency I had suffered for a long time in the course of this attachment , and the anguish that attended its final catastrophe , seemed to give a*n to my whole character , and threw *iie clouds into iimy disposition , which have ever since hung about it . When I became more calm and collected , I appli*id myself , by way of occupation , to the finishing of my work . I brought it to a close as well as I could , and published it ; . but the time and circumstances in which it was produced rendered me always unable to look upon it with satisfaction . Still , it took with the public , and gave me celebrity , as an original work was something remarkable and uncommon in America . I was noticed , caressed , and for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went , I was overwhelmed with attentions . I was full of youth and anin*ation , far different from the being I now am , and I was quiteflushed with this early taste of public favor . Still , however , the career of gayety and notoriety soon palled upon me . I seemed to drift about without aim or object , at the mercy of every breeze ; my heart wanted anchorage . I was naturally susceptible , and tried to form other attachments , but my heart would not hold on . It would continually revert to what it had lost ; and whenever there was a pause in the-hurry of novelty and excitement , I would sink into dismal dejection . For years I could not talk on the subject of this hopeless regret ; I could not even mention her name ; but her image was continually before me , and I dreamed of her incessantly . ' The fragment of which the above is an extract , is doubly interesting as not 695 // only clearing up a mystery which the world has long desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own words .

Her countenance was indeed the faithful image of a mind that was purity itself , and of a heart where compassion and goodness had fixed their abode . To the sweetest disposition that ever graced a woman , was joined a sensibility , not the fictitious creature of the imagination , but the glowing offspring of a pure and affectionate soul . Tenderness , that quality of the heart which gives such a charm to every female virtue , was hers in an eminent degree . It diffused itself over every action of her life . Sometimes blended with a delicate and happy humor , characteristic of her nature , it would delight the social circle ; again , with the most assiduous offices of affection , it would show itself at the sick couch of a parent , a relative , or a friend . In this manner the writer of this brief memorial witnessed those soothing acts of kindness which , under peculiar circumstances , will ever be dear to his memory .

In the month of January we beheld this amiable and interesting girl in the glow of health and spirits , the delight of her friends , the joy and pride of her family ; she is now cold and lifeless as th' clod of the valley . So falls the tender flower of spring as it expands its bosom to the chilling blight of the morning frost .

He had been conversing in the sprightliest mood before , but he sunk at once into uttcr silence , and in a few moments got up and left the house . It is evidence with what romantic tenderness Irving cherished the memory of this early love , that he kept by him through life the Bible and Prayer-Book of Matilda . He lay with them under his pillow in the first days of keen and vivid anguish that followed her loss , and they were ever afterward , in all changes of climate and country , his inseparable companions . ' The scene at the house of Mr. Hoffman , to which the biographer alludes , took place after Irving 's second return from Europe , and after an absence of nearly twenty years from his native land . During this time he had become famous as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first American gentleman in Europe . He had been received at Courts as in his official position ( Secretary of Legation ) and had received the admiration of the social and intellectual aristocracy of England . Returning full of honors , he became at once the lion of New-York , and was greeted by a public dinner at the City Hotel . How little could it have been imagined , that amid all this harvest of honors , while he stood the cynosure of a general admiration , he should still be under the power of a youthful attachment , and that outliving all the glories of his splendid suchess , a maiden , dead thirty years , held him with undying power . While others thought him the happy object of a nation 's popularity , his heart was stealing away from noise and notice to the hallowed ground where Matilda lay . Oh ! what are thousand living loves To that which can not quit the dead ? ' The biographer observes* that it is in the light of this event that we must interpret portions of Rural Funerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eve , ' in Bracebridge Hall . ' From the former of these , we therefore make an extract , which is now so powerfully illustrated by the experience of its author : The sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be divorced . Every other wound we seek to heal ; every other affliction to forget ; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open ; this affliction we cherish and brood over in solitude . Where is the mother that would willingly forget the infant that perished like a blossom from her arms , though every recollection is a pang ? Where is the child that would willingly forget the most tender of parents* though to remember be but to lament ? Who in the hour of agony would forget the friend over whom he mourns ?

Though it may sometimes throw a passing cloud over the bright hour of gayety , or spread a deeper sadness over the hour of gloom , yet who would exchange it even for the song of pleasure or the burst of revelry ? No ; there is a voice from the tomb sweeter than song ; there is a remembrance of the dead to which we turn even from the charms of the living But the grave of those we love , what a place for meditation ! There it is that we call up in long review the whole history of virtue and goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the daily intercourse of intimacy ; there it is that we dwell upon the tenderness , the solemn , awful tenderness of the dying scene .

The feeble , fluttering , thrilling-oh ! how thrilling-pressure of the hand ! The last fond look of the glazing eye turned upon us even from the 4397 // threshold of existence ! The faint , faltering accents struggling in death to give one more assurance of affection ! ' How truly is this passage to be interpreted in the light of the event in Irving 's history , ' when it is evident from a comparison of it with the memoranda , that it is a sketch of that scene which wrecked his brightest hopes , and that here he is renewing in this unequaled description of a dying-bed , the last hours of Matilda Hoffman . The highly-wrought picture presents a complete detail to the eye , and yet still more powerful is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one she looked upon . ' St. Miarlo 's Eve , ' to which reference is also made , was written several years subsequently , and as may be gathered from its tone , under circumstances of peculiar loneliness . It was while a solitary occupant of his lodgings , a stranger in a foreign city , that he felt the inspiration of precious memories , and improved his lonely hours by this exquisite production . I am alone , ' he writes , in my chamber ; but these themes have taken such hold upon me that I can not sleep . The room in which I sit is just fitted to foster such a state of mind . The walls are hung with tapestry , the figures of which are faded and look like unsubstantial shapes melting away from sight . . . . The murmur of voices and the peal of remote laughter no longer reach the ear . The clock from the church , in which so many of the former inhabitants of this house lie buried , has chimed the awful hour of midnight . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that undying affection which abode with him under all changes , and the serene presence of one snatched from him years ago must at such times have invested him as with a spelL Thus he writes : Even the doctrines of departed spirits returning to visit the scenes and beings which were dear to them during the body 's existence , though it has been debased by the absurd superstitions of the vulgar , in itself is awfully solemn and sublime . . . . Raise it above the frivolous purposes to which it has been applied ; strip it of the gloom and hor ror with which it has been surrounded ; and there is none of the whole circle of visionary creeds that could more delightfully elevate the imagination or more tenderly affect the heart . . . . What could be more consoling than the idea that the souls of those we once loved were permitted to return and watch over our welfare ? - that affectionate and guardian spirits sat by our pillows while we slept , keeping a vigil over our most helpless hours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomb yet smiled unseen around us , revealing themselves in those blest dreams wherein they live over again the hours of past endearments ? . . . There are departed beings that I have loved as I never shall love again in this world - that have loved me as I never again shall be loved . If such beings do ever retain in their blessed spheres the attachments they felt on earth ; if they take an interest in the poor concerns of transient mortality , and are permitted to hold communion with those they have loved on earth , I feel as if now , at this deep hour of night , in this silence and solitude , I could receive their visitation with the most solemn but unalloyed delight . ' The use of the plural in the above extract obviated that publicity of his especial bereavement which would have arisen from a reference to one , and it is to be explained by the deaths of three persons to whom he sustained the most endearing though varied relations of which man is capable : his mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two had become sacred memories , and were enshrined in the sanctuary of his soul ; but the latter was a thing of life , whose existence had become identified with his own , and was made sure beyond the power of disease and mortality . Who , indeed , would have been so welcome to the solitary tourist on that weird midnight as she whose Bible and Prayer-Book accompanied his wanderings , whose miniature was his treasure , and of whom he could say : She died in the beauty of her youth , and in m* memory she will ever be young and beautiful . ' That a reunion with all the beloved of earth was a controlling thought in his mind , and one bearing an especial reference to this supreme bereavement , is manifest from the following , from the same sketch : 698 // We take each other by the hand , and we exchange a few words and looks of kindness , and we rejoice together for a few moments , and then days , months , years intervene , and we see and know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together for the full season of this mortal life , the grave soon closes its gates between us , and then our spirits are doomed to remain in separation and widowhood until they meet again in that more perfect state of being , where soul will dwell with soul in blissful communion and there will be neither death , nor absence , nor any thing else to interrupt our felicity . ' Such was the view which cheered the life of one thus early stripped of promised and expected happiness , and to which he clung during all changes of time and place . Amid the infirmities of advancing years , while surrounded by an endearing circle of relatives , who ministered to him with the most watchful affection ; there was one that abode in still closer communion with his heart . While writing in his study at Sunnyside , or pacing , in quiet solitude , the streets of New-York , at all times , a fair young form hovered over him and beckoned him heavenward . Years passed on , until a half-century had been told . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life had passed away . The lover had become a kindly old man . The young essayist had become a great author and an heir of fame . The story of life was complete . The hour of his departure was at hand , when suddenly the same hand which had separated the lovers reunited them forever . Who shall say that the last image which flitted ncross his mind at the awful moment of dissolution , was not that fresh and lovely form which he had cherished in unchanging affection for fifty years ? I have stated my opinion that it was Irving 's disappointment which made him the great American author , and to this opinion I now return with increased confidence . Had the plans of his youth been carried out ; had he become a partner of Mr. Hoffman , and had the hands of the lovers been united , the whole tenor of his life would have been changed . He would have published some fine things , in addition to the Knickerbocker history , and would have ranked high as a gentleman of elegant humor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sympathize with the disappointed lover ; but we feel thankful that from his sorrow we gather such precious fruit . The death of Matilda led him abroad - to Spain , where he compiled his Co1um*us and gathered material for his Alhambrct - and to England , where the Colum6us was finished and published , and where his name became great , in spite of national prejudice . Beside this , the sorrow which cast its sacred shadow upon him gave his writings that endearing charm which fascinates the emotional nature and enabled him to touch the hidden chords of the heart . If Ogilvie could congratulate him on the bankruptcy which drove him from the details of trade to the richer fruition of literary promise , we may consider it a beneficent working of Providence , which afforded to Irving a still earlier emancipation from the law , cheered as it might have been by the kindness of Mr. Hoffman and the society of Matilda . Such being the remarkable chain which unites the names of the author and his love , we can not but consider her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life and amid all the splendid success of his literary career . Indeed , through coming generations of readers , the names of Irving and Matilda will be united in the loveliest and most romantic of associations . I have prolonged this reminiscence to an unexpected length , and yet can not close without a few additional thoughts which grow out of the perusal of the biography . Perhaps the chief of these is the nationality of Irving 's character , particularly while a resident of Europe . Neither the pungent bitterness of the British press nor the patronage of the aristocracy could abate the firmness with which he upheld the dignity of his country . He was not less her representative when a struggling author in Liverpool or London than when Secre 9 // tary of Legation at the Court of St. James , or Ambassador at Madrid . His first appearance abroad was at a time of little foreign travel , and an American was an object of remark and observation . His elegant simplicity reflected honor upon his native land , and amid all classes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruled him . This high tone pervaded his views of publip duty . A gross defaulter having been mentioned in his presence , he replied , that next to robbing one 's father it is , to rob one 's country . ' It is also worthy of note that while Irving lived to unusual fullness of years , yet he never was considered an old man . We do not so much refer to his prect and vigorous frame as to the freshness of his mind . It is said that Goethe , on being asked the definition of a poet , replied : One who preserves to old age the feelings of youth . ' Such was a leading feature in Mr. Irving 's spirit , which , notwithstanding his shadowed hours , was so buoyant and cheerful . His countenance was penseroso when in repose , and allegro in action , and these graces clung to him even in life 's winter , like the flower at the base of the glacier . Among the varied elements which constituted Irving 's popularity , one of them might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revealed by the laws of prosody . Washington is a stately dactyl ; Irving is a sweet and mellow spondee , and thus we have a combination which poets in ancient and modern days have sought with sedulous care , and which should close every line of hexameter verse . Hence a measure such as that found in Washington Irv ing ' terminates every line in Eveengeline , or the works of Virgil , thus : Saying a sad farewell , Evangeline went from the mission , When , over green ways , by long and perilous marches , She had attained at length the depth of the Michigan fore8t . ' Supplicia hausorem scopulis : et nomine Dido , Et recidiva menu posuissem Pergama sict . ' It will be readily percelved that the name of the American author can be substituted for the feet italicized above , without injuring the measure , while in some of Moore 's finest stansas beautifully alternates the same verse , thus : Oh ! fair as the sea-flower , close to thee grow-eng , How light was thy heart till love 's witchery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer lute 6lowing , And hushed all its music , and withered its flame . ' At the close of his last great work , Mr. Irving sought for rest . He laid aside his pen , even from correspondence , and felt that his work was done . When in New-York , he was often to be found at the Astor Library , of which he was a trustee ; but his visits to the city became few , and he seemed to realize that his time was come . To one who kindly remarked , I hope you will soon be better , ' lie calmly replied , in an earnest tone : I shall never be better . ' The words came true too soon , and amid an unequaled pomp of unaffected sorrow , they bore him to a place of rest , by the side of his parents and all of his kin who had gone before him .
