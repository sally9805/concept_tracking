Arriving at his destination his search for employment was unsuccessful , and he concluded to return borne , but having no money , or at least a vary small amount , he started to walk back . On Friday last he reached Acton , Ind , , and , according to his story , he met six men , who at first treated him kindly . They finally took him into an empty warehouse , and after stripping him blacked him from head to foot . These ruffians then procured a box , placed the unfortunate boy in it , nailed the cover down , and , in order to make it more secure , fastened two iron hoops around it . The men then took the box to the Adams Express office , and , after having marked it " IL C. Lord , Esq. , Cincinnati Ohio , " stated to the agent that it contained " live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Fortunately there was very little freight in the car , and the box containing " live stock " was placed near the centre . About an hour after the train left Acton the express messenger 's attention was attracted by a noise coming from the direction where the box had been deposited . He was soon satisfied that the noise came from the box said to contain " live stock , " and procuring a hatchet , he , after considerable difficulty , succeeded in opening it . To his utter astonishment , he found in it a human , being , greatly exhausted , and gasping for breath . The boy in a tem moments recovered , and related the story to the messenger , He was kindly cared for , brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office most of the day on Saturday .
