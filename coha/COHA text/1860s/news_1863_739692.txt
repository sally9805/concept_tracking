txt Members began to depart yesterday . Others followed by the early trains to-day . Nevertheless , nearly or quite Me usual number was present this morning . In the Senate , the Broadway bill hung in in a state of some doubt , while the Cross-Town and Staten Island Ferri ; bills were very much in the same condition . The question was , would the Senate recede from the position of non-concurrence in the House amendments to the Broadway , or adhere , and thus send the bill back to the House ? The latter course would be attended by great danger . it being extremely doubtful whether a majority could again be obtained for it in that body . And yet concurrence seemed to be almost equally difficult . The position of Senator MURPHY in favor of the bill in detail , but opposed in the aggregate , provoked much comment . Nevertheless , the friends of the bill hoped for his vote in the end . In fact , this became a necessity . And yet Senator M. was a man of independent action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positron , he would shape his own course without fear or favor , though possibly not without a sense of embarrassment . Last evening the House thought it discovered one of those little jokers which sometimes tut n up in bills passed , after having been killed off in bills defeated . The case was this : The bill requiring County Treasurers to pay over the moneys in their hands to the State Treasurer when collected , instead of retaining the same for other purposes , was last year before the Legislature , and , after a hot contest , defeated . This year it again made its appearance in the House , where , on repeated trials , the fact was developed that a majority was opposed to it . It was discovered last evening , however , that the annual Tax law , then in the hands of the Governor , contained a section embodying the objectional features of this bill , when Mr. T. C. FIELDS offered a resolution asking for the return of that bill . On the return of the bill to the House the objection-able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate . This morning the Senate non-concurred in the action of the House sent back the bill with a message to that effect , and asked for a Committee of Conference ; whereupon Mr. T. C. FIELDS moved to adhere , and decline the request for a Committee of Conference . This was carried  --  Yeas , 72 ; Nays , 21 . The bill with a message setting forth the action of the House , was then sent to the Senate . Senators MURPLIY , GANSON , Csaux and FOLGEE denounced the action of the House as irregular and revolutionary , and maintained that the self-respect and dignity of the Senate required that it should insist on its own action , instead of receding to gratify the House , whose action , Senator CLARK more than intimated , arose from a regard for the pecuniary interest of County Treasurers . Even if the Tax law failed , it was said , it were better it should be so than that the irregular and reprehensible course of the Assembly be acquiesced in . If that bill should fail , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility and the motive would be well enough understood . After a protracted debate , the Senate finally adopted a resolution that inasmuch as the bill had passed both Houses , and was in the hands of the Governor , the Assembly could not recall it without the consent of the Senate , and that , therefore , the Senate declines to take further action in the matter , As the case stands , unless the House recedes , the Annual Tax bill will fail , unless the bill , with the objectionable clause stricken nut , receives the signature of the Governor . The presentation of flags borne by New-York regiments in the field , and sent home to be placed in the archives of the State . in the Assembly Chamber , today , was a scene of deeply thrilling interest . At the hour of 12 , in accordance with a joint resolution , the Senate , preceded by His Excellency , Gov . Szymoca , appeared In the Assembly Chamber , followed by the Adjutant-General . Major SPRAGIE , and his clerks , bearing seven regimental flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inure eloquent than any words could be . Gov . Serstous , seated in the Speaker 's desk , presided over the joint Convention , acid said that the Adjutant-General , in presenting the flags , would give briefly some particulars of their history . Major SPRAGUE thereupon proceeded to do so . prefacing , in language of genuine patriotic eloquence , the detailed account of the flags , which was heartily cheered . As each flag was unfolded and the torn remnants displayed , the joint Convention and the crowded lobbies and galleries were deeply moved , and cheered vociferously . At the conclusion of this ceremony , Senator Serra offered a series of resolutions , thanking our soldiers lathe field , pledging to sustain them to the end , and to support the Government till the rebellion was put down . Senator FoLoza spoke briefly and eloquently to the resolutions , and was followed by Mr. T. C. Fumes , when Lieut. - Gov . JONES read a poem by ALFRED B. STREET , Esq. , which was excellent , and well adapted to the occasion . Gov . SEYNODE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in doing so made some eloquent and appropriate remarks , after which the question was put anti carried unanimously , followed by three &livers,; in which all joined with a will . Mr. DEAL of the Assembly , then moved that the proceedings of this joint Convention be prepared , under the supervision of the Adjutant-General , that 200 , i1e0 copies be printed , and one copy sent by the Governor to each soldier from this State in the field , the remainder to be distributed among the members of the Legislature . This was adopted unanimously . The proceedings were in ail respects highly appropriate , as well as extremely impressive . It was , moreover , a genuine love-feast of patriotism , ending In a formal , thoroughly meant pledge of the Empire State , by her Representatives in joint Convention , presided over by his Excellency the Governor , in the presence of flags stained by the blood of her sons , and in the name of the memories of her fallen heroes , to fight on , fight ever , till this rebellion is crushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close this dispatch no change in the posture of affairs touching the fate of bills has taken place , nor has the day been productive of anything of special moment beyond what I have given . No light has been shed on Broadway , about whose fate I am disposed to think there is some doubt after all , linked as it is with other bills that have at least strength enough to kill or cure , according to circumstances . The Cross-town bill , with that extraordinary degree of vitality it has manifested from the beginning , has gone to a third leading in the Senate , while the Staten island bill is thought to be in a hopeful condition . The vote on both may be telegraphed before this gets into print . Concerning the final adjournment nothing is yet certain , the House resolution to adjourn to-day at I P. M. , having been laid on the table in the Senate . That body is not ready to indicate the day or the hour . It may be safely predicted that the session will close sometime between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that luminary.
