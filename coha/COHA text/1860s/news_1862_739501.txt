txt Much movement is now going on , and of the greatest consequence , in this part of the country . If I refrain front stating what has come to my knowledge , it is simply because it is of a cnaracter that should not be divulged . A great number of troops are returning through here from the North  --  some returned convalescents , or from their leave of absence having expired ; while many others are going North for the purpose of recruiting fresh soldiers , and not a few ot them to recruit their own exhausted energies . Among the soldiers going North are a great many bands of the various regiments , an order having been recently issued for din-banding them  --  partially , if not totally . Opinions are very much divided in the army respecting the usefulness or uselessness of military bands . Some urge that they are a great and unnecessary expense  --  a cumbrous appendage to an army  --  and in time of action worse than useless , as the musicians are generally among the first to scamper off at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . deny this . They say that musicians exhibit as much courage as is expected from them in their position , and that , so far from being useless on the battle-field , they aid very materially in helping the is ounded , ace . But , whatever may be the truth respecting military bands in time of action , there can be no doubt w hatever that at any other time they are a source of great comfort and exnilaration , if not downright necessity , to our soldiers . Nobody but those who have to endure the long , dreary and monotonous hours too often incident to ca n't , life , can imagine how refreshing it is to hear a band break forth in some well-known air , transporling the hearer instantly among the loved ones at home . The vulgar may laugh at such a notion as visionary , but there is far more truth than poetry in it . Our armies are not composed of senseless boors , but of men the far greater part of whom are refined and intellectual , and to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a luxury , but a necessity . At least , all those with whom I have conversed speak very sorrowfully indeed of having to part with their bands . The proclamation respecting crafting is causing as much flutter here as elsewhere , and the horror at the idea of being drafted will , no doubt , have driven many a volunteer into the army , who had hitherto felt careless if not callous upon the subject . One source of great difficulty will be found in dealing with our three months ' men , numbering several thousands . These all say they took up arms for a specific time , and that at the end of the time specified the Government is bound , in good faith . to set them free . How this view will be met , is more than outsiders can determine . In taking up the Tinge of the last week I have been astonished at finding no list of our sick and wounded  --  nor in the Herald , and other leading papers , ( except the Tribunej  --  although we have bad plenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason for this was that , in order to obtain accurate lists and save some little trouble to the medical department , all the members of the leading Press here agreed with Dr. Guamr to leave the sending of lists entirely to the Associated Press , so that we should all fare alike and the public have one reliable channel to depend on . Confiding in the faith of this arrangement , and taking it for granted that no one paper would either seek or be enabled to obtain any advantage over the others I have not , for a short time back , devoted any alien . ' tion to what was being avowedly performed by others . The system , however , does not seem to work , the New-York Tribune having obtained and printed lists of names that , by agreement , were to be intrusted alone to the Associated Press , and thus secured an advantage over all its competitors . The Times shall not be so caught in future . I shall send you my lists independently , henceforth , unless there is any authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the friends and relatives of our sick and wounded soldiers . U so , you shall soon hear of it . NEMO . FROM ANOVIER CORRES PON DENT . FORTRESS MONROE , Monday , Aug . Norfolk has been in a state of excitement . A few days since an officer of the provost-guard applied to Gen. Ms:wiser ) , of Suffolk , for permission to search a house in that city for arms . Authority was given , and arms and ammunition to some extent were found in a private dwelling near the General 's quarters . Last night in Norfolk a triple guard was put on duty ; this has not been done until many of our guardsmen have been shot at , and some shot down . It is understood that all the inhabitants of the district in the vicinity of Norfolk , Suffolk and Ports mouth are to be put to the test of either taking the oath of allegiance to the United States or to leave for rebeldom.                  @ @ @
