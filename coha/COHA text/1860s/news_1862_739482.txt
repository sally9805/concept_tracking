txt Gen. bieCLutAN 's Address to his soldiers , published in the Times this morning , does not read like the bulletin of a defeated General . On the contrary , he congratulates his men on the fact that they have executed a successful movement in the face of the enemy ; and that they have saved all their material , all their trains , and all their guns except a few lost in battle  --  taking in return guns and colors from the enemy . He further announces that he is now fully prepared for the enemy , who wilt find , when they again attack him , that their repulse will be converted into a final defeat . Richmond , he says , shall be entered by the " Army of the Potomac . " The rebel gunboat Tta:er , we learn from Pori ' tress Monroe , was captured on Friday , in one of the bends of James River . Very important papers were found on board . The battles of Monday and Tuesday last , finishing up the series lasting through seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Army of the Potomac. would be in vain , and since Tuesday night , as we learn by the latest dispatches from Gen. MCCLELLAN to the War Department , there has been no fighting . The fighting on the last two days was of the most terrific character , and the defeat of the rebels was most complete . Even the Richmond Examiner acknowledges that the rebel army was repulsed on iifonday , and that it suffered most terribly in killed and wounded ; and its defeat on Tuesday , as we learn from our own dispatches , was even more decided  --  the gunboats playing an important part , and carrying havoc into the rebel ranks with their heavy shells . Seventeen of our gunboats are now in the James River , protecting the flanks of our army . Gen. MCCLELLAN states that our forces hate not been beaten in any conflict , and that they could not be driven from the field by the uttermost efforts of the enemy . No guns have been lost since the engagement of FMday , the 27th ult. , when Gen. McCALL 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaines ' Hill , and some twenty-fire pieces fell into the hands of the enemy . A correct statement of our losses in killed , wounded and missing can not yet be given , and the estimates vary from fifteen to twenty thousand . We have in our hands less than a thousand rebel prisoners , though many more were captured , but released during the movement to the James River . The present position of our army is one that not only insures its safety , but is admirably adapted to future operations upon Richmond , when it shall have been sufficiently strengthened to renew offensive operations . Forming an arc of a circle , one point rests upon the James River , nearly opposite Fort Darling , and the other touches it at Harrison 's Bar  --  making a front of eight or ten miles . The ground is slightly rolling , with a considerable elevation about a mile from the river , from whence it gradually slopes to the water 's edge . Tho entire rear of the army is thoroughly defended and rendered safe from attack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its favoring bosom . Directly in front , at the point nearest Richmond , the White Oak Swamp and Creek form a protecting barrier ; while a ridge of hills , at whose base runs Turkey Creek , skirted by marshy land on each side , interposes to render approach upon our extreme further wing difficult if not impracticable . For the whole distance , moreover , the gunboats are within range of the outskirts of our lines nearest the enemy , who , profiting by the experience of Tuesday , are unlikely to renew the fighting where they are to be exposed to those dreaded adversaries . A gentleman who came from the James River in the steamship Daniel Webster , which arrived at this port yesterday morning , represents the army of Gen. MCCLELLAN in gooepipirits , eager for reinforcements , and anxious for another chance at the rebels . The men are rapidly getting rested from their seven days ' fighting , and trying to wash oft ' some of the Virginia mud . The Daniel Webster left Harrison 's Bar , on the James River ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this City in 30 hours . The army has great confidence in Gen. MCCLELLAN , and , as well as the enemy , praise the masterly manner in which our movement to the James was conducted . Our gunboats are continually flying up and down the river , shelling suspicious places , and preventing the too near approach of the rebels . The river is filled with boats of all kinds carrying reinforcements and supplies to the army . There was a rumor that Gen. Beeestee had appeared on the other aide of the river , but our informant thinks it will be some time before an advance can be made . A brief dispatch from New - Madrid. dated Saturday , announces that " Vicksburgh is ours . " No particulars are yet received . The Secretary of War received on Friday the Ifellowing dispatches from the Mississippi fleets : UNITED STATES FLAGSHIP HARTFORD . qwq To Hon. Gideon Welles .

He defeated and drove them back , after seven hours ' fighting , during which he lost only 41 men killed , wounded and missing , while the enemy left 65 dead on the field . Two steam transports have arrived at this port from Port Royal  --  the Ocean Queen on Friday , and the Arago on Saturday . There is very little news . Our troops had evacuated James Island and returned to Port Royal . Among the passengers by the Arago were eighty wounded officers , noncommissioned officers and privates . Gen. SHIELDS has not resigned , and has no intention of resigning . Accompanied by a portion of his Staff , he is for the present in New-York , in obedience to the orders of the President . He has been assigned the important duty of aiding in organizing and training , for immediate service , the new quota of volunteers .
