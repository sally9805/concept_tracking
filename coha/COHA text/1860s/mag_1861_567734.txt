ARTICLE 11. - THE PROBLEM OF INSPIRATION . IT often happens , in theological controversy as in war , that from time to time the front of battle changes , and batteries , which commanded the enemy 's position yesterday , are found out of range , and useless , to-day . The first object , in all effectual discussion , must be , to ascertain what is the real question at issue now . " Let the dead past bury its dead . " Until the problem shall be read aright , of course it can not be solved . Will it be too rash to intimate that the true present issues , relating to the subject of In8piration , have hardly been adequately met , nor always apprehended ? The present Article is designed to call attention to the want thus indicated , and to point out the nature and sources of its supply . In the first place , it is plain that at the tribunal of real thought , the question is not , whether a supernatural revelation be po88ible . Philosophers may speculate and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceivable one ; but the common sense of mankind will generally see that if there is a GOD , the author of nature , he can work outside the laws of nature , and carry his work thence within the system of those laws , at pleasure ; and if there is a Being , the Creator of our souls , lie can breathe into them new knowledge , as he did the power to know , at first . To deny that GOD can inspire his creatures , in a strictly supernatural way , is to deny that lie still retains the power exercised in creation , as well as directly to deny his omnipotence , and therefore his existence . Nor , secondly , can it be questioned , to any significant extent , whether an inspiration of religious life and light be needed among men . The evidences of need are innumerable and patent , in every age and on every hand . There is noth // ing men so sorely need , as a higher and pnrer religions life ; and the imperfect success of all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid from some source higher than themselves . If " proud philosophy " boast her power , let her study her own history . lit will not be in the light of that record , that she will dream of regenerating the race . And if it be tauntingly thrown back , in reply , that " neither has revelation succeeded to lift mankind from the slough of misery and sin , " - " Why ? " we ask . Does not the inspired page , its enemies even being judges , shine with a purer light , and enfold a balm of more sovereign healing power , than any scroll that the energy of thought has elsewhere unrolled ? And if even its success appears but partial as yet , are we still in doubt whether men need a revelation of religious light and life from on high ? Nor can one who recognizes the being of a GOD , all-powerful , wise , and benevolent , and the father of our spirits , deny the probability of a revelation from him , such as would supply our need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans of an infinite being , nor pronounce , a priori , with too much confidence , what lie would do under given circumstances . But nothing can prevent us from feeling the strong likelihood , to all human judgment , that a Father , infinitely wise and good , will enlighten and encourage his wandering children on the path of return to himself , when , amid the darkness and dangers of the way , an assisting hand is so much needed . How can we believe that he has a father 's heart , and trust and lean like children on his arm , and doubt that the heart will prompt the arm to succor us in our sorest need ? The most of those who appreciate the character of God will never hesitate , a priori , to pronounce a revelation probable , nay , almost certain . A question has been made respecting the nature of an inspiration , such as might be expected for religious ends ,  - -  whether it would differ in kind from the inspiration , so-called , of genius . But we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or importance . Who shall limit the Creator of the soul , as to the modes in which he may work within it ? // Or who shall prescribe to the Infinite the forms under which his supernatural power shall be put forth ? Who shall assume that all extraordinary mental elevation must be the same in essential nature ? Yet all these assumptions are involved in the idea , evidently entertained chiefly on a priori grounds , that the inspiration of the Scriptures does not differ in nature from that of Socrates , or Shakespeare ; and they are assumptions of the boldest character . In every essential feature , the two cases differ ; nor is there the slightest rational necessity for classing them together . Moreover , the history of the race shows that the inspiration of the highest genius is far from implying coordinate religious light and life . There is a wide difference , in this respect , between Homer and Isaiah , between Voltaire and Paul , between Byron and J ohn . Nothing can be muore absurd than to suppose them inspired in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cases the same-as emanating , in the same sense , from GOD ; of what significance would be the fact ? Might not a difference still exist as to practical religions bearing , as wide as from earth to sky ? If Bezaleel were divinely inspired for his work as truly as Moses for his ; and if Homer , Angelo , and Beethoven , be added to the category ; does it follow that there is no radical difference between the cases ? And must the awful mission of Moses be patronizingly depreciated by the mocking admission , " Yes , Moses was indeed inspired , as were also Homer , Bezaleel , and Angelo . " In other words , is the divine hand , in fitting an Isaiah or a Paul for his sublime mission , to be recognized with no profounder reverence than that with which we behold a clown adapted to his work , or the shoulders of a bullock hardened to the yoke ! Nay , were even the difference to be looked for in the subject matter of the revelation alone , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance of religious inspiration , or its relation to religion and morals ; as we should unquestionably do by classing it with the inspiration of IRaphael and Shakespeare ? Classic models are regarded as authorities in matters of taste . What if ; by a similar inspiration , prophets and apostles become hegitimate // guides in the realm of morals and religion ; do we owe less reverence and obedience to their office , on that account ? Even " a genius for religion , " like that of Homer in poetry , would entitle its possessor to a rank as a religions authority , especially in the absence of a revelation more absolutely divine , little inferior to that claimed by orthodox theologians for the Scriptures ; and sufficient to render it the duty of cavilers to sit down as humble learners at its feet , instead of lifting the feeble tongue of a presumptuous criticism against it ! What signify , then , barren questions of classification and nomenclature ? Genius , at least , has not elsewhere given us the prophecy of Isaiah , the Psalms of David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John . What we most want to know , respecting these books , is something else than the question we have been considering . Nor , finally , is the real issue at this day , whether the Bible involves tn some way an inspiration such as has been described . Too often has been acknowledged , even by its enemies , the immeasurable superiority of the Bible , in elevation of religious consciousness , in depth and strength of religious power and light , over every other book ; too thoroughly have its unique and wonderful characteristics been studied , its transcendent powers recognized , its varied and priceless treasures drawn forth ; too firmly is its position fixed , far beyond comparison , above all that the human heart and mind have elsewhere conceived , or , may we not infer , could ever originate ; to permit longer doubt whether there is , shining through its wonderful sentences , a revelation of religious life and light , by inspiration of God to man . It is easy , indeed , to cavil at many things found on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection which , by the help of some ingenuity , may be urged , or to remove every difficulty which even an honest mind may feel . That as much as this should not be true of a book written by so many hands , in times and circumstances so varied and strange , handed down to periods and types of mind so remote , and above all , dealing with themes so rare , abstract , and difficult , would be a miracle , far greater than all its most // reverent admirers claim for the Bible . But to look on the Bible , and consider the light which has beamed from its peerless pages upon the world ; to mark the spirit and life which from it , and from it alone , have been breathed into the hearts of men ; to trace its history , and that of its associations and effects , upon the fortunes of the race ; to learn how it stands connected with the purest , most elevated , most simple and child-like faith and piety everywhere ; and still deny the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - this , we say it deliberately , is , to a sound and appreciating mind , impossible ! " A glory gilds the sacred page , Majestic , like the sun ; It gives a light to every age ,  - -  It gives , but borrows none . " All the issues above enumerated will doubtless continue to be made . There will be minds in which the objections involved will continue to have a living force ; and others , on the other part , who have not discovered that it is the smoke of battle only that hangs over the field* while the living power of the foe is already entrenched in another quarter . Nor is it strange , or inconsistent with the truth of what has been said , that it should be so . The public mind does not always know the true forces that move it , nor what are the living thoughts which struggle , like Esan and Jacob , in the womb of the present , and are destined to challenge and control the future . There are always eyes which look backward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the corpses of dead foes . There are minds in which the true elements of the problem , though working , are latent and unpronounced . There are those , too , who do not think , but speak ; whose parrot lips repeat the words of cavil and logomachy that they have learned . IDead and dying issues may still , therefore , for a time , sound louder than the living and the true . But the wakeful mind of the age will not be long at fault . " The thunder of the captains , and the shouting , " will be heard and recognized in other quarters of the field ; and there , where // the flag of the van is flying-where the key of the whole campaign is turning , will " Greek meet Greek " in the real " tug of war . " The true questions now at issue , in respect to inspiration -- the points where the mind of the age is , consciously or unconsciously , laboring-as it seems to us , are these : Is the wuo** Bible inspired ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or CONSTITUTE the Bible ? It is supposed by some , that inspiration pervades the Bible somewhat as the light of the sun pervades the atmosphere in a cloudy day . The rays are not distinct , unbroken , and distinguishable from the atmosphere , the vapors , and the scattered and reflected light ; yet the light is there , mingled with the mass of air , and vapor , and other substances , none tile less really , scarcely less powerfully , than if shooting always in defined and parallel beams . So , according to the theory in question , inspiration pervades the mass of human matter in the Scriptures , so mingled , that ,  --  while it can not be said , in a strict , logical sense , though it may with propriety be said rhetorically , " these are the words of the Holy Ghost , " - it can be said , with rigid truthfulness , " there is divine and supernaturally bestowed life and light in them . " By this theory inspiration pervades , rather than constitutes , the Bible . Opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspiration , but all those shades and modifications of it , which claim absolute divine guidance , and therefore authority , for the sense of the whole volume , so far as correctly transcribed and translated . It will be observed that , on the former of these theories , there is room for the supposition of a higher degree of inspiration in certain portions of the Bible than in others ; or even that tile descending scale , by sensible or insensible gradations , should shade ofi into mere humanity . On the latter theory , no such supposition finds room . Thus the three questions proposed above , virtually coalesce in one ,  - -  that between what may be called the MIXED and the PURE theories of the nature of inspiration . Between these two theories lies the problem of inspiration for the present day . // Of course it is uot to be understood that these theories are always , perhaps not often , held in their complete and definite forms . Perhaps few have stated either of them to themselves precisely as here expressed ; or adopted either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact has no relation to the present discussion . We are speaking of the antagonistic ideas which are working in the mind of the age , and it is of no consequence whether we have to explore a single mind , or a score , to find either idea in its full proportions . We believe we have stated the real principles which rule the controversy , however most thinkers may embrace them in a modified or compromised form . Without attempting a discussion of the question thus presented , we offer some considerations , indicative of the field of thought which must be traversed , and the subject matter handled , in such a discussion . And in the first place , it must be conceded that philosophically considered , there is nothing illegitimate or absurd in the mixed theory . It is just as possible that the Creator of the soul should breathe among its faculties an influence only sufficient to effect partial security from error , as that the security should be complete ; that he should shine upon its sight with light so mingled with the beams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with rays distinct and appreciable , like the single beam entering the darkened chambcr of the philosopher . The tacit assumption so often entertained , that the mixed theory deserves no respectful consideration , must be given up . Nor can the reality and momentous character of inspiration , on the ground of the mixed theory , be disputed , any more than upon the plenary idea . The light of the sun is no less real , no less a vast and world-pervading phenomenon , in a cloudy , than in the brightest day . Nor does the mixed theory necessarily involve , however it may often accompany , a depreciative view of the value or the necessity , to the religious interests of mankind , of the inspiration of the Scriptures . He who denies that the day is clear and bright , does not therefore assert that the sun has fallen // from the skies , or that the world could do without his heat and light . Nay , his sense of the blessings showered by that great reflection of the Deity upon the earth , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument . Other points than these are the true hinges upon which this question turns . We venture to suggest , as the principal of these , the following : I. Do the Scriptures themselves decide the question , were their authority taken as conclusive ? It will not do to rule out the testimony of the Scriptures , as interested witnesses . In the courts of France , we believe , the parties in a suit are permitted to give their testimony ; the weight to be attached to it , of course , being determined by all the light which can be obtained upon the case . All the world does the same in the formation of private opinion . There is not a man , of those who reject the testimony of the sacred writers to the sources of their communications , who does not , in every other case , judge partly upon the testimony of the parties concerned . True , he sits in judgment as to the degree of credence to be awarded to the witness . This is precisely what we should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court of universal belief , not of legal judgment . Shall the testimony of proph. ets , and apostles , and of Jesus of Nazareth , as to the sources of their communications to men , be received ? The character of the men , and of their writings , is before us . In hight and depth , in richness , originality , and pregnant power of religious life and consciousness , the Bible owns no peer among all the records of human thought ; nor its writers any rivals in the annals of human piety . Such men would be an authority of the highest value , upon any subject within their knowledge . But when the matter in dispute lies in their own special department , and must be settled mainly in the light of that same religious consciousness , in which they so far excel all other authorities , living or dead , the weight to be attached to their testimony , so far as concurrent and clear , must be little short of overwhelming . If the sources of their spiritual light and elevation were positively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veracity ; and in this respect the ebaracter of the men // is uniinpeached , and unimpeachable . If they had not positive knowledge upon the subject , then their qualifications for judging conic into the account . That their spiritual and religious character , as already described , towers above all other human attainment , is undeniable . IRationalists themselves have indited some of the loftiest eulogiums in its praise . Consummate artists are supposed to be judges , as to the true sources of their own skill . And that modern philosophers , however emimient in other departments of thought , yet with no better claim to superior powers of religious intuition than the best of them can actually boast , should affect to overrule , or patronize , the authority of Moses and Isaiah , of Paul and John , on a question like the one before us , illustrates the absurdity , scarcely less than the assurance , of which the human mind is capable . Unhesitatingly , then , we appeal to the writers of the Scriptures , and ask them what they think of themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their answer , in a general sense , it is not difficult to find . There is no discussion as to their claim of divine inspiration . It is too obvious to be overlooked or denied . But in what sense , or degree , they intend to make the claim , is another question . The advocates of the p*tre theory of inspiration will indeed answer the question without hesitation . They appeal with confidence to that large class of passages , of which " All Scripture is given by inspiration of God ; " " Well spake the Holy Ghost by Esaias the prophet ; " " Which things also , we speak , not in the words which man 's wisdom teacheth , but which the Holy Ghost teacheth ; " " He shall teach y*u all things , and bring all things to your remenibrance whatsoever I have said unto you , " are examples . The advocates of time mixed theory will reply , limiting the import which is to be ascribed to these passages . It will be maintained , that all which we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the supposition of a divine element , vaingled , perhaps , in varying proportions , with the light of human intellect in the Bible . The question of exegesis thus raised , it seems to us , is one of much more importance than appears to have been generally supposed . The champions of plenary inVOL. xix. // spiration , so far as we are acquainted , have , for the most part , contented themselves with establishing the general claim to inspiration on the part of the sacred writers , and have ignored the question , in what sense the claim has been set forth It has been assumed that the former question covers the whole ground . On the other hand , those of the opposite extreme , as already implied , have ruled out the testimony of the Scriptures themselves altogether . There has been an oversight on both sides . Nor do we now propose to discuss the question . We merely indicate it as one of the chief points upon which the whole argument will ultimately turn . It must surely be acknowledged , ere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond all comparison the first and foremost of religious writers in the annals of time , can not be ignored on a question like this ; nor more , can the true import or the extent of the application of their utterances be lightly and without challenge assumed . II . Another question of essential bearing upon the problem before us is , would an inspiration , of the nature contemplated in the mixed theory , answer the purpose for which an inspiration is supposed to be given 2 A negative answer to this question has usually been taken for granted . This will prove , however , a position to be established , not assumed . It will be contended , confidently and plausibly , that an inspiration pervading , instead of constituting , the records ,  --  shining in , rather than upon the natural faculties of the soul ,  --  would act more in harmony with the essential nature of those faculties , and of moral character , and with the relations of these to each other , and therefore more effectively , than one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ground , will require something more than the usual common places , about an absolute authority being the sheet-anchor of our faith , torn from which we drift without helm or compass at the mercy of wind and tide . It will require the sounding of profound depths of thought ; the position and direction of some of which the following remarks may serve imperfectly to indicate . The soul has a constitution and laws given by its Creator , fundamental , and therefore unchangeable . All progress , improvement , or radical change of any sort in it , must take // place in accordance with those laws , and through their agency . And this principle the Creator himself can hardly be supposed to contravene ; since this would be to ignore his own established instrumentality ; would be a departure from his usual method of performing even his most miraculous works by means of natural forces ; and would involve a reconstruction of the soul , to a degree which no one can easily believe , and such as no experience or observation justify us in supposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too sweeping , and whether miraculous interpositions of the Deity ought not to be regarded as coniplete exceptions to the rule , these will at least be considered as only exceptions ; - the rule will still be acknowledged to be general ; and exceptions to a general law can never be expected to predominate in , or become the normal form , of any department of the divine economy . Inspiration , therefore , may , with a certain degree of reason , be expected to approach the soul through those natural laws rather than over them ; otherwise it must not only " Jar the concord of the general plan , " but fail inevitably in the result ; since whatever works against nature will make slow progress , or none at all , so soon as miraculous a geney is withdrawn . It is easy to see that this principle in its general form is not without its bearing , though perhaps with indecisive power , upon the question before ns . But the principle may be traced more specifically . One of the laws of the soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a structure , but a living being . It is not built up of brick and mortar , laid on by the hand of the workman ; it grows by an inward life-principle , taking np , digesting , and assimilating the spiritual food appropriate to its wants . The law of exercise is equally essential in the development of the soul . If the intellect ,  --  the power of thought ,  --  is to be strengthened , it is by thinking , the result is attained ; if the will is to be trained and regulated , by willing , firmly and justly , it is done ; and by feeling , fervently and aright , we learn the more fervently , surely , and appropriately to feel . By the double law of food and exercise , therefore , in beautiful analogy with the // body , the soul must grow , and evolve , and add to its health , and beauty , and power . It is not by inertly receiving , not by tame and passive submission to influences from without , that any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law of its advance not only , but even of the preservation of its present vital worth and force . " For the soul is dead that slumbers . " Inaction results in torpidity , and torpidity in paralysis and decay . Influences from . whatever quarter , to be most effectual , are not to be poured into the soul like water into a vessel . Though " man may eat angels ' food , " it must be food still , to be digested , assimilated , and made the means of growth , not construction . Development , not accretion , is the law of the soul 's benefit and blessing . In beautiful harmony with the foregoing , in the constitution of the soul , is the law of liberty . All moral character is necessarily voluntary . All progress , development , or improvement of that character , must partake of the same element . This at once accords with , confirms , and extends the law of activity already mentioned . Any aid which the soul may receive from a source external to itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aid , not substitute . It must be such , and come and work in such a way as not to snpersede or render too insignificant the voluntary agency of the soul itself . Though the aid in question be from above , it will still address itself in such a way to the will as to leave the work and the responsibility to that faculty in such a sense as the nature of moral quality requires . There is no reason to doubt the possibility of such a mode of operation , while the divine element in the work shall yet be none the less real . For if this can not be , then tIme facts , as well as the doctrines of divine agency in the soul , and free will , are not merely inconsistent , but contradictory to each other . But if such a mode of operation be possible , then we are justified in supposing the voluntary law to reign in all the soul 's progress or change , and in religious , not less than in intellectual life . The bearing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inspiration , is apparent . They manifestly favor , though they do not , indeed , demonstrate the truth of the mixed theory . So far as these principles alone govern the subject , inspiration , to be most effectual , must pour its light and life into the soul , not by external affusion , but by an inward breathing ,  --  an inspiration indeed , so hidden within the natural faculties , and their activity and results , as to be but partially , or with difficulty , distinguishable from them . Mingled , perhaps , in varying shades , with the dull line of human light , the beams of heavenly radiance would show glimpses , rather than views of the road , and by hints in place of full instructions , develop rather than supersede , the free , self-moving activity of the soul . It is to be considered , therefore , how far those states of mind and heart , which constitute religious character , must be self-chosen , self-apprehended , selfwrought , and how far an afilux of motive , of feeling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vitiate the result , by controve*'ting the divinely established principle , " he that will do his will , shall know of the doctrine ; " by which the office of inspiration would seem to be , not to give to the soul the truth , but to inspire it to find it for itself . The principles above stated do not however govern the subject alone . There are others , pointing in a different direction , which have their bearing upon the question , and will play an important part in attaining final truthful results . Among these are the essential nature of the distinction between the natural and the supernatural ; the acknowledged proclivity of human reason to error , especially in relation to religious subjects , and its consequent unfitness to use , and be profited by a revelation coming in the uncertain form contemplated by the mixed theory ; the hostility of the natural heart towards the truth , and its consequent unpropitious influence upon the mind ; and the absolute necessity , from these and other causes , of a positive authority , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases , so far as a clear answer can be obtained . To many minds these considerations will overbalance those of the former class ; and accretion , rather than development , will , to a degree at least , be considered // the type of the soul 's progress ,  --  the law under which divine aid will be bestowed . In regeneration , and in subsequent growth in grace , the " power of the highest " will seem to " overshadow , " rather than shine in us ; and tbe revealed word will conic to us ,  --  a teacher from without , with clear and convincing titles to authority , with definite and logical statements of truth , and with an inspiration unmixed with a human element . It is not our purpose to hold the balance between these partly conflicting and partly complementary views . But it must be held , and with a strong and steady hand , before the probleni of inspiration can be solved . There are other topics bearing a relation to the general subject , analogous to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permits us scarcely more than to suggest . One of these is , the voluntary element infaith ,  --  an element constituting , as is well understood , the life and soul of that leading Christian principle and grace . The truths of religion are presented to us in such a light that they may be discredited . If received , it is not as the demonstrations of mathematics , on evidence which the mind has no power to resist , but by a complex act , in which choice forms no unimportant element . " He that will do his will shall know of the doctrine . " This is the nature of true religious faith . The wisest method of approaching the soul with religious truth , would therefore be in harmony with this law , not to overbear and force its consent , but appealing to a voluntary faith , to offer a form and an evidence which may be rejected . God has placed the evidences of the authority of the scriptures on this basis . We can discredit them if we wish . Their interpretation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no end to dispute in these departments , and not a step is safe and sure beyond the beckoning fingers of the awakened conscience and the willing heart . From analogy then we might reason , that the inspiration of the scriptures would be conceived upon the same idea ; not pure and simple , so as to preclude all judgment and inquiry on the part of man 's moral sense , but subject to question , and calling for the exercise of conscientious discrimination and a willing heart . It is to be considered how far these // considerations afford an argument in favor of the theory , that inspiration would probably pervade the scriptures , in such a manner as not to oppress the reason and the conscience with resistless authority , but rather to quicken those faculties , that they may themselves see and recognize th' truth . Another topic of this class is suggested by the question , whether the character of the precent aqe , and probably of succeeding ages , requires to be approached with religious influences of a different nature from those adapted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact may be regarded , a fact it is , that the mind of the race is moving with giant tread toward freedom . In some countries the march is already rapid ; throughout Christendom it is sensible ; while even beneath the crescent and the pagoda , sigus of life and motion are beginning to appear . The causes of this are various , and , humanly speaking , omnipotent . Christianity itself , directly or indirectly , is accountable for much if not most of it . The press , the compass , steam-power and locomotion , the telegraph , and ten thousand other inventions and discoveries both in science and in the arts of life , have reacted with powerful effect* for the mind that learns to conquer nature will soon turn its bold investigating eye beyond the material world . Civil liberty , itself the child of the Bibletaught idea of the worth , and hence the dignity and rights of the soul , has begotten freedom of thought , and confidence in human reason , and conscience , and will . Authority no longer bears sway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parents , government , institutions , traditions , the past , all these have seen the sweep of their scepter narrowing , and the force of its sway gradually diminishing . It is vain , as it is easy , to lament this fact as a proof of the degeneracy of the times . We do not object to any well-aimed efforts to correct it ; these may be called for , but their consideration has no relevancy to the present discussion . A more pertinent inquiry would be , whether the fact does not result from causes too deep and constitutional in nature to render an escape from them possible . Should this question be answered in the affirmative , would it or would it not follow , that positive authorities must henceforth // bear a less important part in establishing religions faith and principle , and life in the soul ? And may , or may it not be , that God purposely gave us his word in such a form , that while received in the rigid , authoritative sense by the elder ages , it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience , elevate the reason , and gird up the loins of the will , that they may themselves perceive , and feel , and decide ; rather than to fill the soul with knowledge , and almost with feeling and volition , ready made to its hands ? Just as the predictions of ancient prophecy , concerning the Messiah , were purposely so constructed , that while the Jews could see naught in them but the promise of a temporal prince , to restore the earthly glory of Israel , Christian readers , studying under the gospel light , recognize on every page the harbingers of coming spiritual day . Still another related question is , how far the pure theory of inspiration , and the cognate conception of spiritual progress by accretion , are responsible for that blind unreasoning superstition , which finds its home in Rome , and its outposts in exclusive theories of church organization and ordinances , and especially in pro-slavery Christianity . We hear much of the danger of rationalizing tendencies in the church . The danger is real , although by some exaggerated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ' wrought more injury by far , than all that has resulted from rationalism . It has given us the errors named above , and many more . The tone of mind and thought , which does not look the rationale of its faith in the face , which swallows all spiritual aliment on authority , without presuming to taste its quality , is prepared to be the dupe of whatever superstition shall first present a plausible claim to respect . Who would have dreamed of going to the Bible to find a sanction for slavery , had not men been taught to believe that the authority of any part of the Bible-of any part taken by itself-is sufficient to sanetify anything ? It is a question whether that view of inspiration , which brings it to bear upon the soul as an absolute authority , and some times perhaps with almost smothering force , has not done much to produce this baleful superstition , with all its // often blood-stained fruits . This too is a question which we do not decide . It must be considered , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimately , for good , of the two methods of inspiration supposed . It is worthy of inquiry also , whether the living , spiritual , appreciative style of interpretation , contended for by such writers as Tayler Lewisj though advocated in the interest of the highest conception of scriptural authority , is not really in sympathy with the looser view of inspiration ; throwing us , as that view does , upon the habit of estimating the value of a passage , by the power of its appeal to our higher spiritual consciousness . The very idea of a revelation constructed upon the mixed theory , supposes an appeal to a responsive spirit in the reader . What Prof. Lewis deprecates as a dry , mechanical , lifeless style of interpretation , is it not the natural fruit of the idea that every word in the Bible demands an equally blind submission ; which appeals , of course , for interpretation , to the logical understanding alone , instead of to the higher faculty of spiritual and moral intuition ? There has always been difficulty in rejecting the theory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the style of many passages of the scripture ; and more perhaps from the vital connection in all style between the thought and language ,  --  the latter the body , the former the soul ; a connection so strictly vital that no full inspiration of the thought is possible that shall not extend in a measure to the language also , even as the human countenance responds in outward expression to the throes of thought and passion within . Moreover , the surrender of the verbal theory by no means relieves the doctrine of plenary inspiration from its heaviest difficulties , and is therefore the less an object . The mixed theory opens the door for inspiration in word as well as in thought , so far as the strange power of the language requires it , and allows us to close it in time to exclude whatever elements are manifestly " of the earth , earthy . " These too are thoughts worthy of consideration . On these questions , // as on others going before , we give no decision . But they must be decided before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed theory of inspiration , would answer the purpose for which a revelation must be supposed to be given . III . The third important point upon which the main question turns , relates to the principle on which the scriptures are actually constructed , in a respect now to be explained . The scriptures are not constructed as they would have been , had God said , " Let us make everything as clear as possible . " Look at the ancient prophecies ; look at the Apocalypse ; look at many of the sayings of Christ himself ; look at the obscurity hanging over the history and authenticity of many of the books both of the Old Testament and New . Are not the most important doctrines often left in such a light , that the attraction of a heart in sympathy with them is necessary to lead us into the truth . A brief , a passing allusion , perhaps , may be all that is revealed upon subjects over which thousands of minds have toiled in vain in every age of the church . Who has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such controversies as those respecting baptism , ordination , church government , the Trinity , the divinity of Christ , original sin , depravity , free-agency , imputation , and many others ,  --  precluded , we mean , so far as the fact of the doctrine is concerned , not its philosophical explanation ,  --  those sentences were not given . Not one of those doctrines has been made as clear , in the scriptures , as it might have been . In a thousand passages the meaning can only be obtained by great labor ; in many it has not yet been obtained . And even where most clear , all is unsystematic and out of logical place . The order and arrangement must be made by men . Have we observed , moreover , that the teachings of the Bible are more frequently of a suggestive than of a dogmatic character ? Hints , Iignres , rhetorical rather than logical expressions , abound ; and nothing is easier than to make out a thousand absurdities , contradictions , and moral deformities , if the reader brings not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sympathy with the true , but often hidden // spirit of the word . The whole book is as far as possible from nianifesting the design to send forth the streams of truth in channels so definite that they should not mingle with the turbid waters of human insight and speculation . Everything rather suggests the idea that in the mind of the inspiring Spirit , to awaken the human reason and conscience , and set them at work , shedding only light enough that they might feel their way , was its object , more than to carry , or even lead them by the hand to the desired result . It thus becomes a question whether the Bible is not , after all , as a matter of fact , constructed on the principle of the mixed theory . For what is the difference in principle , between giving a revelation , which it is known must be stumbled and disputed over , and seldom fully understood , and giving one mingled with human matter ? We do not say there is none . But what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us , we do not remember to have seen discussed . We venture to think that the question will be found one of some significancy . The foregoing we regard as indicating , in part at least , the general range of thought upon which the solution of the main problem depends . We have stated the arguments in favor of a modified theory of inspiration thus fully , because we wish to convince our orthodox brethren that they exist , and that they must be considered . Perhaps they have been so more than we are aware of , but we must believe that something is still wanting . Should it be thought that we have treated views , which may be considered unsafe , with too much respect , we have only to reply , we have simply aimed to state the problem . In so doing , nothing could be gained by suppressing or shading over any of its conditions . They must all come out eventually , and be met ; and until this is done , all the labor expended upon the question will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question is seen , the sooner it will be settled . We have no fear that the Bible is destined to lose one iota of its power over mankind . Some of its defensive fortifications may be changed for others , as the great tide of change in the world rolls on ; but any such change , wrought by the most searching // scrutiny , and the most candid concessions , we need not fear that revelation can not bear . For ourselves , the feeling of wondering reverence for the Bible has grown more solemn and profound with the studies of which the foregoing observations present the result . More and more deeply we feel the truth , that the eternal hopes and destinies of men hang simply on that Holy Book . More and more we feel that all true spiritual attainment , all highest and purest religious experience , must bow in humble and loving worship upon its sacred pages . A thousand spiritual battles may yet be fought over it ; they may be necessary to fix more firmly its foundations ; but none will ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Within that awful volume lies The mystery of mysteries Happiest they of human race , To whom God has granted grace To read , to fear , to hope , to pray , To lift the latch and force the way ; And better had they ne'er been born , Who read to doubt , or read to scorn .
