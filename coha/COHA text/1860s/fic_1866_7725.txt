Brooks , Charles Timothy , 1813-1883 : Our Land and its Memories . BY CHARLES T. BROOKS . from Our Land and its Memories ( 1866 ) From Dan to Beersheba of this our land Of promise have I passed , from strand to strand ; Have seen the moon o'er Campo Bello rise , And watched the sun in far South-western skies , What time his fiery axle , wheeling slow , Stood on the reddening Gulf of Mexico . Slowly I 've labored , with the panting steam , Up Mississippi 's tortuous , turbid stream , Where , at each bend , each wood-crowned sweep , behold Sea after sea its noble bays unfold ! There , in the glimmering dusk , when far-off trees Like spectres stand , the cheated vision sees Strange shows of fleets and fleet-girt cities , rife With all the stir of busy human life . Mark , as by magic , Orient Stamboul rise ! Its bristling masts , a forest , meet your eyes , Where , half of sight and half of fancy born , Wind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' mid hoary , reverend groves we glide , Where Gunga 's thousand islets break the tide ; Where , robed with pendant moss , the aged trees Stand like the priests of Nature 's mysteries . Fades each fair vision with a puff of steam , As onward still we labor up the stream . But , lo ! where , in her stateliness and pride , Looks out o'er all the valley , far and wide , That young queen city , " thrond by the West , " What visions of the future fire the breast ! Eastward she looks ; and seems , with noble eye , Her proud Atlantic sisters to defy , And glow in the great race and rivalry . With reverent step and swelling heart I 've pressed The boundless prairie of the teeming West ; And where the northern lakes , a mighty chain , Stretch their bright links along our vast domain , There have I travelled ,  --  there , transported , seen Blue inland oceans , piny oceans green . And where New England 's Alps majestic rise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whence , seen afar , our noble rivers glance Like threads of silver in the broad expanse ; And where earth seems a living map  --  no more  --  Dotted with towns , with forests speckled o'er . And I have stood , and felt a nameless thrill Of reverence and rapture , on the hill , Where , calmly looking down on the fair shore Of Chesapeake and stately Baltimore , In emblematic , marble majesty , Stands Washington , " in the clear , upper sky , " And breathes his benediction . Have not we A goodly heritage from sea to sea , From lake to gulf ? What noble rivers pour Their inland tribute to the extended shore ! O'er rolling upland and on waving plain , By town and farm , what peace and plenty reign ! And must the day come when fraternal war Shall rend our mighty empire , star from star ? Or ( worse ) Corruption 's canker eat the chain No earthly arm had power to snap in twain ? Must the day come , when over freemen 's graves Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the proud flag , whose field of starry blue Tells of the sky , whence our young Freedom drew Her life 's first breath ,  --  the flag , whose stripes of red Tell of the brave who at her summons bled ,  --  Shall droop inglorious , or dishonored lie , A taunt , a jest , a sign of infamy ? Benignant Heaven , forbid ! and ye , whose dust Our soil , " from Maine to Georgia , " holds in trust ! Forbid it , living sons of those dead sires , Who lit on Freedom 's heights the morn-watch-fires , Whose heart 's blood , when they fell , enriched the sod , And scattered seed of valor far abroad , That , mouldering in full many a furrow , lies , Our nobler harvest , ripening for the skies ! Gone is the day when our young eagle heard The cry of war , and in his eyrie stirred ; When Quincy saw the blood-red dawning nigh , And Warren , at the call , made haste to die ; When Otis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a patriot merchant 's name ; Gone is the day ,  --  compatriots , never more May dawn its like !  --  when , ghastly-red with gore , Yon altar-height the smoke of sacrifice Sent up , in summer sunlight , to the skies . Gone is the day ; and , oh , not soon may men Beat back the ploughshare to a sword again ! Yet warfare , brothers , is our honored lot , A warfare that , while life lasts , endeth not .
