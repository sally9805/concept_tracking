ARTICLE X.-JMPORTANCE OF THE PASTORAL OFFICE . AT the annual meeting of the General Association of Connecticut , in June of the present year , at New Britain , a Report was presented by a Committee , who had been appointed for that purpose at the meeting in 1864 , " upon the Importance of the Pastoral Office , and the desirableness that the duties appropriate to it should be prosecuted with greater efficiency in our Churches . " This Committee consisted of Rev. Prof. Noah Porter , D. D. , Rev. B. L. Swan , and IRev . W. W. Davenport . It has seemed so desirable that the suggestions made in that Report should be brought to the attention of Pastors and people throughout the whole country , that we have requested permission to place it in full upon our pages . The Committee to whom was referred the consideration of " the importance of the Pastoral office , " and " the duties appropriate to it , " present the following Report : We have abundant evidence that the ministers of this State discharge their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they are animated with a self-denying and Christian spirit in the labors and trials which their sacred calling involves . We do not believe that any portion of the Christian church is favored with a body of clergy more distinguished for knowledge of the scriptures , for ability to expound and defend its doctrines , or for zeal in the enforcement of its principles upon the hearts and lives of their hearers , than are the Congregational churches of our beloved Commonwealth . We can not , however , resist the conviction that " the importance of the Pastoral office " is by no means so highly appreciated , either by the ministry or the churches , as it deserves to be , and as it was formerly and that " the duties appropriate to it " are in some cases not prosecuted so earnestly as is desir // able and necessary for the highest efficiency of the ministerial work , and for the greatest prosperity of religion . We omit the consideration of those influences which operate at all times , and in all branches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacities of the pastoral office , and ask your attention to the circumstances which at the present tune , in our denomination and our own State , seem specially to hinder the abundant and successful discharge of the duties appropriate to the Pastor 's work . It will be understood that we intend the work of the Pastor as contrasted with that of the Preacher . The points which we think deserve special attention are the following : 1 . Pastors often enter upon their work in connection with a particular parish , with the expectation that it will probably be of short duration . The uncertainties of the times , the quarrelsome disposition previously manifested in the parish , the readiness of one or more weak and perverse men in church or parish to stir up strife , the chronic habit of becoming dissatislied on frivolous pretexts or slight occasions , the presence of some root of bitterness never thoroughly eradicated , the want of adequate support , all furnish good ground for the inference that the tenure of the ministry in many parishes will probably be short , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . In many cases , however , the Pastor enters upon his work with the distinct expectation , it may be with the earnest wish , that another more inviting or promising field may at no very remote period present itself . The parish at present occupied is regarded as a desirable place for the quiet study of theology or literature , as an arena for one 's first essays in public speaking , as a place in which to elaborate some superior sermons , as a sphere from which to earn and to gain influence amj notoriety among the churches , or as a field of mere experiment , in which to try and prove one 's undeveloped powers . Whatever may be the grounds of this expectation , whether they are reasonable or unreasonable , or whether if faulty , the fault is with minister or people , it is obvious , that when the expectation exists , and is consciously cherished , or even uncon // sciously allowed , it may stand in the way of ' the full development of the possibilities of the pastoral work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to live in a community for ten , twenty , or thirty years , if he have any right views of his duty as a minister , or even of his position as an influential citizen , will be incited to become thoroughly acquainted with the families and the individuals of his own parish , as well as to understand the sources of evil or springs of possible good , which can only be learned by a study of the local peculiarities and history of ' the church and people . After he has come to understand his people , lie will be earnest to devise plans for their good , not only those which promise immediate results , but those which may require years to ripen and bring forth fruit , in the improved intelligence , the elevated tastes , the better education , the more liberal culture , the higher Christian civilization of the families with which the family of the Pastor is to be intimately associated , of the children that are to be companions of his children , and of the men and women who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . But if , on the other hand , the Pastor looks upon his present parish as chiefly interesting to himself because it is a good sphere for immediate work , which work is to be mainly accomplished through preaching , or if he regards it simply as a convenient place to pass through to one that is better , he can not view the people of the parish with that permanent interest or sympathy which is necessary for the full efficiency of the Pastor 's work . The minister who is ever looking out for or holding himself ready to go into another field , can not devote the full energy of his interest or his labor to the field that he is at present occu ) ying . We do not here discuss the question , whether long or short terms of pastoral occupancy are to be preferred , nor do we ask whether anything can be done to arrest the tendency on the part of either Pastor or people needlessly to shorten this term . We would simply call the attention of Pastors to the danger to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate which they place upon the relative claims of their various duties . // If it be inevitable that many of our parishes , for the fault of the people themselves , should for the present be lodging places for the arrival and departure of their spiritual guides , places from which the minister is to migrate as regularly as the birds , the necessity is imperative that the ministers themselves should be aroused to the especial obligation of doing all in the way of pastoral influence , as well as of pulpit ministrations , for the welfare of the parish to which they are called to labor for so short a period . They should seek to make the fullest possible proof of their ministry in all its capacities of influence during the brief time alloted to them . It may be , that , as the result of special energy and success in pastoral duty , the parish itself will be cured of its fickle and actious tendencies ; the shifting and arid sands will be fixed by the good seed taking strong root ; and the scene of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired house will be both honored and blessed with a fixed and homelike parsonage , a center alike for the affections of Pastor and people . 2 . Pastors and people in the Congregational churches very properly attach great importance to the sermon . The people demand that their minister shall be an able and an interesting preacher . The Pastor who expects to influence his people relies chiefly upon the superiority and the variety of his preacYing . It is believed that in no denomination is the demand so pressing upon the Pastors as it is in our own , and that consequently there are no churches in which the attention of Pastors is so concentrated upon , and often engrossed with , the preparation for the pulpit . The natural consequence is , that some Pastors have either found or deemed it impossible to perform their pastoral duties with efficiency or interest , and also to make the preparation which satisfies them , and have therefore finally abandoned the expectation of doing more than to meet the mnost pressing demands upon their time which are made by sickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy or politeness . Others find in this circumstance a reason for excusing themselves from any thorough or systematic prosecution of such duties . They visit their people as little as possible , and always give as a reason that they are // engrossed with their necessary studies . Others begin their ministerial life with mistaken notions in respect to their own capacity to discharge the social duties of the Pastor with comfort and success . They find a reason in the demands of the pulpit for their own indulged reserve and bookishness , and plead their incapacity to profit their people in any other way ; whereas , this incapacity is but another name for dormant powers or powers not yet developed , and their social nature is simply unused , and therefore unknown even to themselves . Others entirely overlook the importance of an intimate acquaintance with the individuals and families of their flock as a condition of success in the making of sermons , and as the means of giving to the sermon that point and directness , that freshness and familiarity of manner , which are essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of furnishing that fullness and richness of matter which distinguish a Christian sermon from a strained and so-called original oration , or an ingenious or ambitious essay . Others are formally taught , or readily accept the view , that sermons , after this vicious pattern , are demanded by the taste of the times , and must be produced , whatever may be the cost , and so devote themselves deliberately to the composition of such discourses , wisely concluding that such efforts are altogether incompatible with the claims of pastoral duty , as indeed they are with any just views of the nature of the Christian ministry . 3 . Our denomination is peculiar in another respect . It is to its credit and honor that its ministry is prominent in zeal , and conspicuous for boldness in the application of the principles of the gospel to the external conduct , and in the great reformations of society . The Congregational pulpit of Connecticut , to its honor be it spoken , has given no uncertain sound of opinion in all great moral and political crises . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause of Temperance . It has contended for Liberty and the Union in the convulsive agitations that have attended our recent struggle for national existence . Whenever any bold or trying work for God or for man is to be done , or any heroic words are to be spoken , it is always expected that the Congre // I7nporta7tce of the Pastoral Ojjfice . Sm gational minister will be first and foremost to meet the exigency , and to brave the hostility of " unreasonable and wicked men . " It sometimes happens as a consequence , that he is the most exposed to the hatred of those whose vices he reproves ; or whose political expectations he indirectly contributes to disappoint . If such persons arc without his parish , they do not hesitate to manifest their hostility to his person and his influence . If they remain within it , their coldness and alienation repel him from their society , and impede his free and familiar intercourse with their families . It happens not unfrequently that the sensitive minister finds as he thinks , in all this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few families ; and by degrees kindly and confidential feeling ceases to exist between the Pastor and many of the households of his charge . If in the warmth of his zeal , or the boldness of his eloquence , he has overstepped the bounds of a kind and tolerant judgment of those whose souls he would save , or if be has justly or unjustly exposed himself to the charge of uttering personalities . the difficulty of maintaining pleasant relations with those who choose to be offended is greatly enhanced . iNot a few Pastors are induced in such cases to withhold the active exercise of all pastoral functions except as they are specially invited , and pusillanimously to withdraw from the assertion and exercise of the rights of their own position , because of some offense which has been taken by a portion of their flock . It is the part of true courage and of pastoral fidelity , under all circumstances , to maintain an open demeanor and free intercourse with all the flock and oft ento show special courtesy to those whose vices or perverseness we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God must not strive , but be gentle to all men , apt to teach , patient , in meekness instructing such as oppose themselves . " 4 . The spirit of the Congregational churches and ministers , especially in Connecticut , is eminently unsectarian . Our principles forbid us to attach excessive importance to any form of church government , to any mode of observing sacramental rites , or to the name , the measures , or polity instituted by any eminent reformer or preacher . These churches were the // mother churches of the commonwealth . Our fathers planted this soil , and at one time our churches eared for all the population . Our ministers in former times were the chosen and respected guides of the whole parish , and were regarded as the leaders of opinion , as well as the friends of the poor and afflicted in every household . It is not surprising that when the integrity of their flocks was first threatened , when preachers of some strange denomination caine in to draw away the hearts of their friends and spiritual children , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church should be so rudely and causelessly broken , and that what they viewed as the pure doctrine and order of the Scriptures should be questioned or rejected . But in general they have maintained from the first , the dignity ' which is becoming to the Christian minister , and have been specially averse to practice any of those arts of proselyting which in some cases have been practised against what was formerly the " standing order . " To this day , their snccessors maintain the same traditional spirit , and are studiously and conscientiously averse to using any arts except those which are Christian and manly , in order to gain or retain the affection or confidence of the old and the young , when plied by the blandishments of divisive and proselyting sectarians . It is well understood in all communities that the Congregationalist minister can not and will not barter his dignity by using any other arts than those of open and fair dealing towards other denominations . Perhaps our delicacy upon this point approaches and even reaches a vicious extreme . It may even happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have the most sacred claim upon his kind attention , because they prefer to be married or buried by Episcopal rites , or because one of the family has been baptized b* immersion , or has been enrolled in a Wesleyan class ; perhaps for no better reason than that such persons or families rarely attend any place of worship , and never the Congregational . There are , it is believed , in some of our rural parishes and in all of our large towns , scores , and perhaps hundreds of families , which are neglected by our ministers , through this over-scrupulousness , lest they should be considered as stealers // of sheep from the folds of others . There may be Pastors who on this pretext excuse themselves from the duty of drawing into their own folds the sheep that are wandering in uninclosed and desert wastes . It would be worthy to consider whether such scruples would deter the good Shepherd from seeking out and following those that are lost . 5 . The views which are universally received by our ministry respecting the nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are best fitted to promote high attainments in the Christian life , are sometimes used as a reason for depreciating the importance of the Pastor 's work , and the quiet and genial influences which it is fitted to foster and cherish . The habit of insisting mainly on the need of an immediate and consciously experienced conversion , the incessant occupation of the mind with the reasonings and appeals appropriate to a season of especial awakening , the earnest expostulation with the slothful and worldly among professed disciples , the instant watching and waiting for the first signs of a revival of the work of the Spirit , often tend to bring the mind of the Pastor into an anxious and impatient condition which is unfavorable to the exercise of those social influences which establish him in the love and confidence of the families of his flock , and to the hopeful and patient training of the young in the gentle ways which invite and prepare for the effectual work of the Spirit . It may well be questioned whether if Pastors were less impatient and eager for immediate success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to Christ , and for carrying them forward in his service , would not be more wise and efilcient ,  --  whether their preaching would not be more instructive and elevating , and their social influence would not be a constant holding forth of the word of life , as well as give additional force to the spoken word . Surely there is no rela tion more sacred than that which holds a Pastor and the families of a generous people in the bonds of mutual confidence and love . Whatever strengthens these bonds , whether it be a kind word , a pleasant recognition , a hearty greeting , a neighborly kindness , a meek response to an angry challenge , a peace-making effort in times of social or party strife , and , // above all , the constant and hearty sympathy with the joys , and hopes , and aspirations of the children and youth ; these all are as truly means of grace and instruments of the Spirit , as the most pointed exhortation or the most earnest and rousing sermoii . In the harvest time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with glowing and exciting ardor , we forget how far the domestic training of the household , the restraining and elevating influences of Christian society , the oft-repeated instruction of the Sabbath School , the cherished love for the Pastor as a man , have been efficient in maturing the growth which suddenly passes from blossm into ripened fruitage . We overlook also the important part which the Pastor has had in originating , invigorating , and sustaining these very influences-through which the Divine Spirit has been moving in preparation for his saving work . Forgetting this , we fail to take heart for the Pastor 's privileges , and to find quickening motives for zeal in the daily and sometimes dull or secular routine of the Pastor 's work . 6 . There is a less distinct reference to the pastoral work as one of the essential functions of the clerical profession in the training of our theological seminaries , and the practical views of our working clergy , than in some other denominations . We talk of the ministry , and we train for the ministry , with exalted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We forget sometimes that it is through earthly and human conditions that these high qualities and characteristics can be made attractive and effective . We are too readily satisfied if our ministers are devoted Christians , learned students , sound theologians , and , above all , eloquent , ingenious , and attractive preachers . We lose sight of the importance of those social and personal relations through which these essential qualities are made manifest and attractive . Above all , we are too indifferent to the duties of business and routine which , in this as in every other profession , decide so largely the question of the efficiency and success of a gifted and highly educated soul . We are satisfied if the intellect is cultured , and the heart is right , and , above all , if the power to exhort and preach is attained , and care less for habits of system and order in // the discharge of public responsibilities . We do not ask whether judgment and tact , whether humanity and common sense , have been developed , whether , in short , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the working duties of his manifold and most trying protbssion . It is certainly no dishonor to as pure and devoted a body of clergy as the world can furnish , to suggest that they may be so earnest for the substantial qualifications as to overlook the importance of those which are accessory , and injuriously to depreciate qualities of secondary and inferior value . We do well to insist that the sermon should be effective and superior ; is it wise , therefore , to care little for the elevating influence of the devotional service ? We seek to win and compel men by our eloquent appeals , and our ingenious arguments ; but is an eloquent life , as expressed in a patient and loving temper , in a wise and skillful adaptation to individual men in instructive conversation , less powerful to persuade and even to constrain ? It seems to many a waste of precious time , a degradation of choice gifts , to spend them in any other way than in reading , thought , and composition . It may be ; but a man whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose gifts are so choice , or whose taste is so fastidious as not to be freely and willingly expended in the plans , and words , and deeds of pastoral intercourse , is ordinarily too highly , or else wrongly cultured , for the clerical profession , which in ordinary cases requires the exercise of the pastoral function for its successful prosecution . The example of the Great Teacher and Pastor should reprove all such judgments , and should inspire the greatest and mbst gifted to be eminent examples of sympathy and patience towards the lowliest and the humblest . Few clergymen , in modern times , have been distinguished by the choicest intellectual endowments , and gifted with higher capacities of pure intellect ; few , it would seem , have been more specially fitted for public eloquence as their sole function , than were Thomas Chalmers and Lyman Beecher . And yet , it may be questioned , whether the success of these eminent servants of Christ was owing more to their power in the pulpit and with the pen , than to their skill in developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pactoral O*ffice. resources of the pastoral office . It may be doubted whether their greatness was more conspicuous in the eloquence and fervor of their preaching , than in their fertility in devising plans for the good of the parishes and communities in which they labored , and the spirit and perseverance with which they directed the details of their execution2* The interest excited by the public movements of the times , and by the discussion of the principles involved in them , the enterprising and aggressive spirit of our denomination , the active intellectual life and comprehensive spirit which have always eharacterised our ministry , may have withdrawn our attention too much from the humbler and less obtrusive duties of our profession . But these duties caniiot be dispensed with permanently , without loss to both minister and people ; loss to the minister in effectiveness and snecess , and loss to the people in spiritual and temporal prosperity . Should it ever come to be true that the Pastors of our churches are in comparison with those of other denominations less attentive to the farnilies of their charge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sick and the stranger , less systematic and faithful in their knowledge of and care for individual souls , it will certainly follow that the denomination will gradually lose * The thought might perhaps occur to some of our readers , that neither of these eminent men was conspicuous for some of those habits or endowments which enter into the conception of the good Pastor . It is not contended that either of them were especially gifted with what Cecil calls the art of parlor preaching . The command of these arts is by no means essential to eminent success in pastoral administration . Sometimes a fatal facility in them is a serious hindrance . But no one can have read with attention the lives of these divines , without being deeply impressed with the conviction , that both of them were earnestly engrossed with thougbts and care for the welfare of the souls committed to their care-were abundant in devices for the direct and remote improvement of the communities in which they lived , and most earnestly intent upon the success of those plans in the evangelization of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of the pastoral enterprises of Dr. Chalmers for Glasgow and Edinburgh , and of those of Dr Reecher for Litchfield , Boston , and Cincinnati , may be pondered with profit by every Pastor . The thought should ever be present to elevate and sustain , that " a Christian minister , fighting the devil in the ohscurest parish , has higher and grander ideas than ever entered into the mind of Alexander or Julius Cresar . " July , // its hold upon the attachment of the people of our State , and the sanctuaries in which the fathers worshiped in such numbers will be deserted by their children . No ministerial gifts or ministerial energy will compensate for this prime defect ; no power in the pulpit , no reputation among the churches , no pyrotechnics of oratory , no strained intellectual gymnastics can be substituted for the contact of the living person with individual souls , in familiar , friendly , sympathizing , and spiritual intercourse . In these days of books and newspapers , of lectnres and discussions , the people of our churches will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but , on the other , they will not require the highest intellectual excitement conceivable from every Sabbath discourse , provided it contains direct , pointed , weighty truth ; especially if that truth is uttered from lips that in the week time are often opened for friendly and earnest words , and from a heart that is known to beat warmly for the welfare of their children , their families , and the community . The question is earnestly asked , what shall be done to increase the attachment to our denomination , of the members of our churches and congregations ? Shall we change the form and order of our worship so as to allow the people the oral repetition of prayers or responses ? Shall we introduce the antiphonal reading or singing of the Psalms , or use more freely the grand old chants of the medkeval church ? Shall we seek to exalt the authority or dignity of the clerical office by uttering homilies upon time duty of greater deference to and respect for it ? Are there any features in the worship and the ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are all questions which are attracting the attention of many earnest Congregationalists , which iY is perfectly legitimate to discuss . There is one feature which it is safe to imitate . It is a feature which contributes more to the strength of any denomination in which it is conspicuous , than any other that can be named-that is , fidelity , minuteness , and system in the pastoral care . There is at least one denomination in which this is a prominent characteristic . We venture to affirm that it gives to that denomination greater strength and // a firmer hold upon the affections of its members , than its liturgy , its clerical robes , or its punctilious regard to the proprieties of outward worship , or than all these combined together . It will almost uniformly be found to be true , that the clergy of the Episcopal church not only keep a Parish Register , but that they study it closely , and profit by the suggestions which a frequent reference to it is fitted to excite . They know and number the families of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and train for confirmation . They show by their personal presence and attentions , that they care for all who are attached to their congregations . It is traditional with them to foster and deepen the impression upon every such person , that he or she has an interest in the community of the Christian church , of which the Rector is the guardian , and in some sense the chief representative and impersonation . It is this personal assumption of care , affection , and duty , this constant maintenance of a living and real function , this holding forth of the word of life by a living person who acts out the claims which he asserts , which gives " the Rector* ' an advantage which " the Pastor " may assert to himself with equal propriety , and turn to a far more efficient use . It is not at all in a spirit of disparagement that we say these things of " the Rector , " but it is to his honor that we record his fidelity to his calling . We could wish that the Pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to copy and surpass him . The increase of the pastoral feeling , on the part of the minister , will certainly contribute to the increase of the true church by feeling on the part of the flock . It would he idle in this connection to enumerate the many advantages which we claim for our own freer and more flexible polity , and for the more earnest and energetic type of Christianity which we desire to promote . If , however , we fail to secure to ourselves this indispensable condition of an efficient ministry , we shall fail to prosper . If it is to be allowed to our clergy with their more earnest theology , their larger opportunities for power in the pulpit , and the offices of devotion , to fail in that one feature which connects them vitally with the people , and gives them power over individual souls , we shall fail in everything ; // and Congregationalism itself will gradually but surely cease to retain its hold upon the confidence and affection of its own children . But the organic weakness of Congregationalism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual strength . It requires " living stones " in the temple , if the temple itself is to be blessed of the Lord , and hence a never ceasing responsibility is imposed upon all its members to be active , zealous , devoted on the one hand , and forbearing , harmonious , and united on the other . It requires that its ministry should in word and life be leaders and examples to the flock . If they fail in any essential function of their office , the whole body must suffer , and they must bear the reproach . Upon the Congregational Pastor , more than upon any other , there is laid the pressing obligation , nay , the ever urgent necessity not only to " preach the word , " but to be " instant in season and out of season , to reprove , rebuke , and exhort with all long suffr*ring , " and with the wise and well adapted " doctrine " which the Pastor 's skill and the Pastor 's faithful love alone can minister .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
