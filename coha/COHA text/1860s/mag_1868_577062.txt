OF LITERATURE , SCIENCE , ART , AND NATIONAL INTERESTS . VOL . II. -NOVEMBER1SG8.N0 XJ . WHO OF US ARE INSANE ? I* this paper I propose to show that mental and moral diseases are much more frequent in community than is commonly supposed ; that persons afflicted with the incipient and milder phases of what we call insanity are all about us , on every hand , and mingle with success in the various relations of life ; and that only in the severer and exceptional cases is it found necessary to confine them in public institutions , or place them under any form of special treatment or surveillance . That all forms of mental and moral disease are symptoms of morbid conditions of the brain , is now as well established as any fact of science . The elaborate researches of Professor Schraeder van der Kolk , and other European observers , have shown most clearly that the brains of patients who die insane , idiotic , or imbecile , give evidence , on microscopic examination , of diseased conditions sufficient to account for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a symptom of disease of the brain , is not found among the inferior species , who have little or no nervous system , and only exceptionally among the higher orders of animals . It is comparatively rare among wild and barbarous tribes . As would logically be expected , its manifestations are most frequent and most severe in civilized communities , and among the intellectual or ruling classes . Insanity increases in frequency and in violence with the progress of civilization , and is indeed a part of the price that we pay for intellectuality and refinement . It was never before so common as at the present day , and it appears to be rapidly increasing and multiplying its phases in direct proportion to our progress in art , in science , in literature , in trade , in finance , and in all the departments of modern activity through which the brain is so constantly harassed and overworked . While we escape or recover from many of the inflammations and fevers that decimate the savage tribes , and are , on the whole , healthier and longer-lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity to which they are comparatively strangers . In order to understand the nature and the range of diseases of the brain , we should compare them with those of the other bodily organs . Take for illustration the very familiar symptom of disorder of the stomach and digestive apparatus-dyspepsia . In nearly all of the essential particulars it will be found to be analogous to insanity . IDyspepsia is not a disease as such , but is merely a symptom of some organic or functional Entered , in the year 1Mb , be ( 0 P PUTNAM &amp; SON , in the Clerke Office of the Dietrict Court of the U. S. foe the Soothero Dieteje ? cf N. Y. // disease of the digestive apparatus ; so also insanity is merely a name given to the severer symptoms of disease of the brain . The diseases of the digestive organs are indicated by a wide range of symptoms , such as pain in the region of the stomach , headache , constipation , nervousness , and general debility ; the disorders of the brain are also manifested by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked and most commonly observed . Disturbances of the digestive tract sympathetically affect all other portions of thc system ; the same is true of disease of the brain . Dyspepsia is very often , and perhaps usually , the consequence of general debility ; it is now well understood that attacks of insanity are preceded by constitutional feebleness . Dyspepsia is most frequent among civilized lands , and among those classes who are inclined to abuse their stomachs and overtask their nervous systems ; insanity is pre&amp;*minently the disease of civilization , and is very rarely met with except among those classes who overwork and over-worry their brains . Dyspepsia , in its early stages , is amenable to treatment , but when long continued is very obstinate , and often incurable ; insanity and all other manifestations of cerebral disease are relievable , and even curable in the early stages , especially in the young , but after they have become firmly seated in the aged , are exceedingly intractable . Dyspepsia is best treated by remedies directed to the stomach , combined with constitutional tonics insanity likewise yields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brain and a strengthening influence on the entire system . It will be seen , then , that in their causation , their frequency , the circle of their influence , their duration , their influence on the general system , in the variety of the symptoms by which they are manifested , and the indications for and results of treatment , the diseases of the brain and digestive apparatus are closely parallel . Insanity is , in short , a dyspepsict of the brain . Any injurious cause acting in the brain-such as poi sons in the blood , congestion , or the opposite condition , anaemia , wounds of the skull that affect the cranial contents , thickening , softening , atrophy , or sympathetic irritation from other organs , may render the processes of the mental and moral nature difficult and painful , just as analogous causes acting on the digestive system may similarly disturb the processes of digestion . The abnormal symptoms in the one case are commonly known as insanity , melancholy , hypochondriasis , imbecility , mania , and nervousness ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartburn , and debility . But the parallel between the diseases of the brain and digestive system may be extended still further , for it is evident , in view of what has been said , that the range of insanity and dyspepsia must be as wide as the morbid conditions of which they are the symptoms . We all know that there are almost innumerable degrees and varieties of dyspepsia , from the acute spasm that annoys us but for an instant to the protracted agony and emaciation of a lifetime . Between these two extremes there is an almost interminable variety of phases and degrees that dyspepsia may assume , corresponding to the different morbid conditions of the digestive organs . Just so there are innumerable varieties and degrees of insanity , from the momentary attacks of ungovernable rage to the perpetual frenzy of the madman . Between these two extremes there are as many phases and degrees as there are different morbid conditions that may be supposed to exist in the brain . But , as has been already remarked , the susceptibility of the brain to disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its structure is more complicated , and its functions more important and more various . We should expect then that the symptoms of cerebral disease would be more numerous , more subtle , and more complicated than those of the disease* of digestion . We should expect that the incipient , transitory , and completely harmless cases of insanity ( that term being used to corer all symp // toms of disease of the brain ) , would be very common among us , would complicate , to a greater or less extent , the every-day life of civilization . If now we look closely enough into this matter , if we study minutely the eccentricities , the vaga'ies , the manias , the passions , and the crimes of society , we shall find that , in many instances , they are explainable only on the theory I have here advanced . We shall find that among the higher orders of society , among our leaders in business , in literature , in art , in science , as well as among the ignorant , the simple , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incipient and fleeting or milder disease of the brain , who are thereby rendered more or less eccentric and whimsical , or ill-balanced and positively dangerous . That eccentricity often becomes absolute mania is now conceded by all students of mental disease , and is pretty well understood by the people at large . The only question is , how great a degree of eccentricity may be allowed to coexist with a perfectly healthy brain . The true and philosophical answer to this query is , in general , that any desire , passion , emotion , or special aptitude may become a disease when indulged in too long , or too exclusively , or under unfavorable conditions . It is , of course , oftentimes very difficult to decide , in any given case , whether any marked peculiarity is the result of a very active and one-sided development of the brain , or of actual disease . The general principle on which our decisions must be based is , that when any feeling , passion , emotion , or even a special aptitude becomes absolutely ungovernable , so as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or of the well-being of his friends ; when , as it were , it absorbs the whole being , so as to destroy what we call common sense , blunts the reason and conscience , and urges on to a manner of life and to special deeds that are repugnant to the average intuition of mankind , then we have reason to suspect the existence of disease of the brain . It will be objected , and with good reason , that the average sentiment and experience of mankind is a very indefinite standard by which to test the sanity of an individual . But , after all , it is by this same standard that we judge that any internal organ of the body is diseased . Recurring to our illustration of the diseases of the digestive apparatus , how is it that the physician can ascertain whether his patient is suffering from dyspepsia or not ? Obviously , only by comparing the symptoms that the patient exhibits , and the feelings of which he complains , with the symptoms and feelings experienced by the average of persons who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we become informed of the existence of disease in all organs of the body that are hidden from actual inspection or physical examination . In our examination of the lungs we are , it is true , assisted by auscultation and percussion , but even the principle on which the diagnosis is made is simply the comparison of the sounds heard in the chest of the patient with those that obtain in the average of healthy lungs . The brain is enclosed by bony covering , and can not be inspected during life , except in cases of injury . Its diseases can therefore only be studied through the general symptoms . It will also be objected to this test , that it has , over and over again , been proved to be very fallible ; that the grossest mistakes have been and are continually being made through its use ; that it has caused some of the most original and gifted minds of the world to suffer persecution as criminals or lunatics . This practical objection is a very serious one , but it will apply just as truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordinary methods of diagnosticating the maladies of any of the internal organs . Physicians have been making terrible blunders in regard to diseases for thousands of years , but in the main we rely upon them , and , in the main , they are pretty nearly correct . One important distinction , however , should not be forgotten . The dyspeptic patient // can , in a measure , study his own symptoms , and decide for himself in regard to the existence of disease ; the lunatic , on the other hand , by the very nature of his affection , is usually rendered incapable of making a proper comparison between his own condition and that of the general average of mankind . It is usually one of the symptoms of cerebral disease , that the patient does not suspect and will not believe the nature of his malady . To this general rule there are exceptions , and there are those who have watched and appreciated the slow progress of disease of their brains , during the earlier stages , just as calmly and just as unerringly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other organ of the body . The illustrations of these incipient and milder stages of cerebral disease , or of what is called partial insanity* or monomania , are so numerous that when we begin to adduce them we find it difficule to make the selection . As I pave already stated , any passion , emotion , and thought , of which the brain is capable , when perverted from the recognized average common sense and intuition of mankind , may give rise to the suspicion of disease of that portion of the brain of which it is the function . All the noblest qualities of human character may become perverted by disease . The domestic affections are exceedingly liable to be perverted , and thus may lead to the most hideous crimes . Not a week passes in which the journals do not contain accounts of suicide or murder  --  the results of disappointed or frenzied love . A short time since a young man , who had long and desperately paid court to a lady , at last invited her to ride with him in a lonely wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tendercst of all earthly passions had been so long over-exercised and thwarted , that disease of some kind had been engendered in that portion of the brain of which it is the special function . Love disappointed had turned to hate , and hate impelled to crime . Even the love of a mother may become perverted . The cruel and most unnatural treatment that the English poet Savage received from his motherhis early expulsion from home , and her attempts to take his life-can only be accounted for on the supposition that she was the victim of cerebral disease . The common expression , " love is mad , " is very often a literal , scientific truth , and applies to every form of affection , from the lowest to the highest , from the fondness toward the animal creation to the love of God himself . When love turns to hate it should be regarded always and invariably as a symptom of disease . This was well illustrated by the conduct of King Frederic of Prussia toward his son and sister . Without any reason whatever he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural and brutal severity . He kicked them about the room , pommelled their heads with chairs , compelled them to eat the most repulsive food , and in every way made their lives wretched . His insanity , in this respect , was absolute , and should have sent him to the mad-house . The illustrations of this type of cerebral disease are almost innumerable . History abounds with them , and they are increasingly familiar to every-day life . Unnatural and absurd fondness for any one kind of domestic pet is apt to be the result of disease . I knew of an old woman who kept in her house fifteen or twenty cats , to all of whom she had given names , and whom she fed and watched over with almost as great assiduity as though they had been her children . Instances even more marked than this are recorded , where people have conceived a fondness for animals that are not usually introduced into the household , and whose entire life has been concentrated on the exercise of their strange affection . These peculiar fondnesses arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bereaved mothers , who have so long and so deeply grieved over the want or the loss of proper objects of affection , that their brains have gradually become diseased . The appetite for food and drink may // also become perverted by disease , and sometimes to the most astounding degree . Bulimia , or excessive appetite for food , and methomania or dipsomania , or inordinate desire for intoxicating drinks , are now fully recognized as diseases . The late Dr. Francis , in giving a brief sketch of the character of one of the prominent citizens of old New York , said that charity compelled him to believe that his enormous appetite was the result of disease . Excessive appetite is one of the charncteristic symptoms of epilepsy , and it is oftentimes as uncontrollable as are the paroxysms themselves . Epileptics will rise from the floor , after a severe attack , during which they have frothed at the mouth , and exhibited the most violent contortions , go to the table and eat with a rapidity and ferocity that can only he explained by the supposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the digestive apparatus are in a moAAd condition . Ungovernable attacks of passion , violent temper , and unnatural cruelty , are the results of insanity far more frequently than will probably be admitted by those who have not given this subject close and special attention . This class of patients are all about us , and are oftentimes all the more disagreeable and dangerous from the fact that in their calm moments they may he perfectly sane , upright , and kindly . Their disease has its exacerbations , its paroxysms of attack , a during the intervals their bearing may be entirely courteous , and their whole disposition sweet and tender . Some of the greatest and noblest men of history have been the victims of these paroxysmal attacks of insanity , and for that reason have been oftentimes terribly misjudged . They have been accused of inconsistency , of hypocrisy , and their strange conduct has caused many to lose all their faith in truth , purity , or virtue . It may be remarked , by the way , that this paroxysmal character is not peculiar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other organs , are liabI*to exacerbations , or paroxysms of attack , just as much as diseases of the brain , and , during the intervals , the patient may appear to be entirely well . Howard the philanthropist , who crossed seas and mountains to relieve the distressed , was a brute and a tyrant in his own family . Dr. Winslow says of him : " His cruel treatment caused the death of his wife . He was in the habit , for many years , of doing penance before her picture . He had an ody son whom for the slightest offence he punished with terrible severity , making him stand for hours in a grotto in the garden . The son became a lunatic as the result of this brutal treatment . " I am strongly inclined to the opinion that even the extraordinary benevolence of Howard was one of the symptoms of the disease in his brain , for insanity may have good as well as evil manifestations , and such exceptional self-sacrifice as his , so blind , so persistent , so lifeenduring , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the directly opposite qualities of ungovernable rage , intense hate , or cruelty . There is a point beyond which not only forbearance , but also the manifestations of benevolence , charity , self-sacrifice , devotion , spirituality-of all the higher and nobler qualities of humanity-may cease to be virtues . Very much of the cruelty that we meet with in every-day life is the work of the partially insane . I know some really good men who sometimes , under peculiar circumstances , act more like lunatics than like reasonable beings . I knew a farmer , a conscientious and worthy man , who was at times attacked with paroxysms of rage so violent and irresistible , that he would beat his oxen most unmercifully , and without provocation . An acquaintance of mine told me that his father , who was one of the kindest of men in his family , very often whipped his children almost to death , and that , too , despite the tearful appeals of his wife , to whom he was most devotedly attached . Much of the tyranny and despotism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , if justice had been // done , not a few of the rulers of history would have been confined in asylums for the insane . Caligula , the beastly Roman Emperor , was certainly a lunatic . His accession to the throne was greeted with joy by the Roman people , and he afterwards became so popular , by the generous and conciliatory acts of his reign , that when he was attacked with sickness , sacrifices were offered in the temples for his recovery . His brain undoubtedly became diseased during his sickness , for from that time he became a changed man . The remaining four years of his reign were disgraced by some of the most unnatural and capricious tyranny recorded in history . He put to death a large number of his senators . Every ten days he delivered human victims to be devoured by wild beasts , and jocosely termed this horrid act " clearing his account . " He caused divine honors to be paid to himself , in a templ*e erected expressly for that purpose , and under the superintendence of priests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incitatus to dine at the royal table , where he was fed on gilded oats and drank wine from jewelled goblets , and but for his premature death this animal would have been raised to the consulship . In a more enlightened and liberal age Caligula would have been deposed and sent to an insane-retreat . The Romans endured his cruelty for four years , and then put him to death by a well-planned and successful conspiracy . The career of Nero was somewhat like that of Caligula . In youth he was notably clever , kindly , and amiable , and for the first five years of his reign he ruled with clemency and justice . He was at this time so harassed by the attempts of his mother to wrest the sceptre from his hands , that his brain probably became disordered , and he was metamorphosed into a tyrant . He poisoned his own brother at a feast to which he had invited him . His mother , Agrippina , he murdered in her own bed . He relentlessly persecuted the Christians , on the plea that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed Lucan the poet and Seneca the philosopher , and kicked his own wife to death . Nor was his insanity manifested by acts of cruelty alone . He had a silly rage for music , and in his morbid ambition to be thought the greatest singer of the world , he appeared on the stage in the character of an operatic performer . Domitian , Heliogabalus , and possibly also some of the tyrants of Rome , must have been of unsound mind . Domitian , like Caligula and Nero , begun to reign with generosity , and under the pressures and worryings of govemment he developed into a monster . Heliogabalus made his horse consul , appointed a senate of women , forced the Romans to worship a black stone , and prepared golden swords and daggers , and cords of silk and gold , in order to put an end to his own life whenever he saw fit . All these were the freaks of a madman . Alexander the Great behaved like a lunatic in the latter days of his reign , and the supposition is plausible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have become a most implacable and capricious tyrant . From being very abstemious he gave himself up to debauchery . His lust for power became a disease , and he strove for gigantic impossibilities . Robespierre and some of the other leaders in the French Revolution were probably made more or less insane by the exciting events in which they took part . It is certain that Robespierre was natively kind-hearted and considerate , for he began life by endeavoring to procure the abolition of capital punishment . Louis XL of France was insane both in his despotic cruelty and in his caprices . He shut up his nobles in cages or hung them on the trees of the forest . He lived in constant fear of death , kept in seclusion in his castle , was on intimate terms with his hangman , amused himself by watching battles between rats and cats , drank the blood of young children , and tried various and abominable compounds in order to lengthen his life Jeffi*4s , the notorious English judge , was a raving maniac ; and that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on the scientific ignorance than on the political cruelty of the age . We are compelled to believe also that Queen Christina of Sweden , who murdered her paramour , was in a morbid mental condition when she committed the deed ; and on the same theory I account for the hideous and unfeminine cruelty of Catherine de Medici . Of the insanity of Frederic William of Prussia I have already spoken ; but his unnatural and whimsical treatment of his son and family was only one of its symptoms . He was inconsistently avaricious , scrutinizing every household expense with absurd attention , and lavishing fortunes on his army of giants . He would run through the streets caning the loungers and workmen who fell in his way until they roared for mercy . Theodore , the late king of Abyssinia , was probably a madman . All accounts agree in r*presenting him as being at first a just , considerate , as well as enterprising , ruler ; but under the excitement and anxiety of domestic afflictions and the rebellions that took place in his realm , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Caligula , and Domitian . The latter acts of his reign gave every evidence of a disordered brain . Fortunately , our own country has thus far been mostly free from the rule of partial lunatics . Whether the inconsistencies of President Johnson 's administratioa are due to cerebral disease or to native obstinacy , prejudice , and ignorance , can not , at present , be well determined . Extreme avarice may often be regarded as a symptom of disease of the brain . All very great misers are more or less insane . The desire of money is so absorbing and so constant , and the affliction of poverty is so perpetually dreaded , and the financial trials , successes , and surprises of life are so frequent and so exciting , that the love of acquisition , which is in itself a virtue , becomes so far perverted as to be an actual symptom of disease . There are people who are Perfectly sane on every subject except those in which money is concerned . Such persons deny themselves and those nearest to them of the plainest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their strength , in extreme old age , even when they and their heirs are beyond the possibility of want ; or constantly worry about the future , living in continual fear of the poor-house ; or incessantly count and re-counf* their possessions , under the apprehension that they are slipping from their grasp ; or commit the greatest extravagancies in useless directions while denying themselves of daily comforts . A common symptom of this form of insanity is to imagine oneself to be poor even in the midst of wealth . Most of the eccentric wills that now often attract the public attention are the creation of brains that have become diseased by long dwelling on matters of finance ; and it is just to assume that our institutions of charity are considerably indebted to the insanity of the rich for some of their most important legacies . I knew a man , of education and rare ability , who , for a long number of years , hoarded a fortune that he possessed in order that he might leave it to a number of benevolent societies . That the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he scrimped his wife , his children , and his servants , even in the minutest acts of expenditure ; imposed on the hospitality of friends and the forbearance of his kinsmen ; and in short , by his lifelong acts of meanness , made his name a bye-word and a reproach wherever he was known . Yet during most of these years he was actively engaged in responsible dutie* , and was justly regarded as a man of unusual ability and attainments ; and not until his later and declining years did his friends ever suspect that he was a monomaniac . My own view is , that , from the first , his avarice was with him a symptom of cerebral disease , and the acts of imbecility and weakness that he committed , and the abandonment into which he fell , finally convinced those who knew him best that in matters of // finance he was not a morally responsible being . Great and unexpected success as well as failure may give rise to financial insanity . Sudden wealth as well as sudden poverty may so excite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A striking case of this form of insanity is thus related by Dr. Winslow : " A young gentleman having ? 10,000 , undisposed of and unemployed , placed it for business purposes in the hands of his confidential broker . This sum he invested in a stock that had an unexpected , sudden , and enormous rise in value . In a fortunate moment he sold out , and the ? 10,000 realized ? 60,000 . An account of the successful monetary speculation was transmitted to the fortunate owner of this large sum . The startling intelligence produced a severe shock to the nervous system , and the mind lost its equilibrium . The poor fellow continued in a state of mental alienation for the remainder of his life . his constant occupation until the day of his death was playing witli his fingers , and continually repeating without intermission , and with great animation and rapidity , the words , " Si ty thou8and ! sixty t/iowsand ! sixty thousand ! " Insanity may manifest itself by great extravagance as well as by meanness . A medical acquaintance relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was consulted by a gentleman , who , by fortunate speculation , had suddenly become a millionnaire . The first time he came he handed the *doctor a fifty-dollar bill , saying as he did so , " Your fee , doctor , I prefer to pay as I go . " Nothing was thought of this , for it was precisely what any grateful and free-hearted patient might do ; but on the next visit , which was but two or three days afterward , he again handed the doctor a fifty-dollar bill , with the same remark as before . His disease was of a chronic nature , and demanded a protracted course of treatment . He visited the doclor at his office several times a-week for a number of months , and each time invarin bly offered a fifty-dollar bill . The doctor was afterwards informed that he became so reckless in his expenditures that it was necessary for his wife or some friend to travel with him , in order to keep him from throwing his money away . He would throw a ten-dollar bill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy who blacked his boots . A year 's travel in Europe ultimately restored him to a measure of health , and , at last accounts , he was fully capable of managing his affairs . Conscientiousness itself may become morbid , and when associated , as it so often is , with religious melancholy , is a very obstinate form of insanity . Much of the petty tyranny of school-teachers , guardians , and others in authority , is the result of disease of this faculty , and it is quite unfortunate for society that this fact is not better understood . I have known of two instructors for the young , whose administration of the government of the schools over which they presided was characterized by most unreasonable and inconsistent severity , and by that absurd regard for the tithe of mint and anise and cummin , which is so peculiarly distressing to children , and to all who are in any position of dependence . They enacted and enforced useless regulations , restricted their pupils in the exercise of the commonest privileges , and , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sorrow to themselves and to all who were in any way subject to them . Both of these teachers held important positions , one as teacher in a large academy , the other as principal of a ladies ' seminary . Both were regarded , by those who did not know them too intimately , as faithful though somewhat injudicious teachers , and both were hated and despised by their pupils . Both have since given such unmistakable proofs of mental alienation , as to compel them to abandon their calling , and one , at least , has gone to an asylum . These cases presented no remarkable features , but were simply typical of their class . // Religious mania is a very frequent and harassing manifestation of cerebral disease , and one which requires the largest tact and patience in its management . Not a little of the extraordinary self-sacrifice and voluntary renunciation of the common enjoyments and aspirations of existence , so often exemplified under both the true and false religions , is due to disease of the brain , which is brought on by over-exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insanity is so familiar that it is hardly necessary for me to cite instances that illustrate it . It is met with in India , amid the darkness of paganism , among the Mohammedans , as well as in all Christian countries both Catholic and Protestant . it appears among all nations who have any distinct idea of a God and a future state , but is especially liable to visit those who are possessed of a deep and earnest and absorbing religious nt*ture that is wrought upon by trials and the influence of a partial or one-sided mental training . Among the symptoms of religious monomania are the constant fear of the wrath of an offended God , and a disposition to perform extraordinary acts of self-mortification , extravagant dread of approaching death , and a painful consciousness of sin and unworthiness that can find no consolation in the Divine promise of mercy , persistent and wasting melancholy , and constant temptations to commit suicide . Some have a directly opposite experience , and are subject to agreeable and inspiring hallucinations . They imagine themselves in heaven , in direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commissioned to proclaim His will to men , and go forth to found sects and reform the universe . They experience the most extravagant and ecstatic joy , break forth into rapturous songs or ejaculations in the midst of public assemblies , and by gestures , dances , physical contortions , recklessly violate the customr of society and public decorum . Sometimes religious lunatics arc possessed with the idea that they should not only mortify their own flesh , but , so far as possible , should persecute to the bitter end all who differ from them in matters of faith . There is no doubt that the cruelty of the religious wars and persecutions of the world has oftentimes been greatly intensified by the insanity of those who were engaged in them . Dr. Winslow thus narrates a typical instance of this manifestation of insanity : " A person who had been very active in leading and encouraging the bloody deeds of St. Bartholomew 's day at Paris , when confessing on his deathbed his sins to a worthy ecclesiastic , was asked , Have you nothing to say about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occasion God Almighty u*as obliged to me ! ' " Some of the most successful founders of religious sects were more or less insane . Francis d'Assissi , Loyola , and INlahomet , and some of the founders of our modern religious orders and denominations , exhibited very suspicious symptoms of cerebral disease . Religious excitements , such as attend the starting of new sects and the advance of proselytism , and even our most useful revivals , give rise , especially among the lower classes , to temporary or permanent attacks of insanity . The rise and spread of Spiritualism and Mormonism have been attended with a very painful increase of religious insanity among all those classes who were influenced by these creeds , or who were drawn into the discussions which they called forth . There are about us , in every walk of life , persons who , in matters of religion , are unable to think a rational thought or speak a rational word , and yet , on all other subjects , uniformly show themselves to be perfectly sane and true . It would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than is experienced by some of the religiously insane . A gentleman who was at one time under my observation used to depict the horrors of his spiritual condition in language that was at once graphic and appalling , lie was harassed , as the religiously insane , often are , with fearful doubts and skepticism in regard to the // truths of inspiration , the destiny of man , and other dark problems of existence , and neither the advice and sympathy of his friends , nor his own honest efforts , seemed to afford him any ray of hope or joy . He would represent himself as " hanging by one arm over the verge of a precipice , that his strength was gradually failing , and that he must soon fall and be dashed to pieces ; " as " surrounded on every side by a cordon of raging fires that were rapidly closing in upon him , and from which there could be no escape . " But all this time he was pursuing his regular duties , and not even his intimate friends suspected him of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest ; but before a year had elapsed it was found necessary to send him to an asylum . Self-brooding , and deep-seated , persistent melancholy that is not traceable to any special exciting cause , is always evidence of a tendency to disease of the brain , that may or may not develop into positive insanity . Disease of the moral faculties may assume an entirely different form ; and instead of oversensitiveness , and morbid apprehensions , there may be an utter callosity of the moral perceptions . This type of disease is most frequently observed among merchants , speculators , and public men , because these classes are subjected to great pressures that severely task the strength of the moral nature . It is a very suggestive fact that statesmen and politicians who during their early manhood and maturity have been pure , courageous , and upright , become in their old age extremely corrupt , cowardly , and unprincipled . It is clear to me that in some instances , at least , this shocking demoralization of our aged politicians is due to actual disease of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral faculties are subjected by the temptations and crises of political life are sometimes sufficient to overpower the brain and render it , to all appearance , insensible to moral impressions . In this way we may account for some of the instances that have been so often and so recently ob served , of deflection from moral rectitude and desertion of life-long principles on the part of the most trusted and most beloved of our public men . This leads us to the consideration of insanity in its relation to crime . This subject is too wide for discussion in an essay like this , but I may say in general , that the insanity which leads to the commission of crime is to be adjudged by precisely the same standard *s any other manifestation of cerebral disorder . There are certain limits of criminality that no one can overstep without rendering himself liable to the just suspicion of insanity . When men who have sustained even a tolerable reputation in community suddenly commit some hideous outrage at which a professed scoundrel would revolt , or execute some great fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of crime that is repugnant to the general average of criminals , or from which they can not reap any advantage , it is pertinent to inquire whether they may not be the victim of some type or degree of disease of the brain . Each individual case must , however , be studied by itself , and both judges and juries should be enlightened by the testimony of conipetent and reliable experts . The time is certainly not far distant when some of thejudicial decisions of the past and the present will be regarded as barbarous . There are sometimes arraigned before our courts unfortunate prisoners whose execution by the arm of law would be a greater crime than that for which they were convicted . We have no more right to take the life of a lunatic whose disease has allowed him to violate the laws of society , than we have to enter an asylum and drag its inmates to execution . The fault in such cases , if there be any , is with society itself , so far as it allows unrestricted and unwatched liberty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that many of the dangerous classes give no evidences of mental disease until they shock community by some terrible fraud or outrage , and therefore can not in all cases be successfully // guarded against . This fact is , perhaps , the weightiest of all arguments in favor of the substitution of imprisonment for hanging in all capital offences . In cases where , in spite of unprejudiced care and the skill of experts , a lunatic may have becn condemned to suffer punishment , a course of imprisonment might give opportunity for a full understanding of the culprit 's mental condition , and the subsequent exercise of executive clemency . The record of judicial murder is at best a dark and gloomy page in the world 's annals . Insanity was not as common in the earlier eras and among barbarous nations as at present , but during the past few centuries the number of unfortunates who have been hanged and guillotined for the crime of having a diseased brain must be very great indeed . Although the advanced minds in both the medical and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a possible , but a very frequent , cause of crime , yet the great mass of the people are opposed to the acquittal of criminals on any such ground . When Mary Harris was acquitted in Washington on the plea of insanity , the press and the country were bitterly and sincerely indignant ; but the decision of the jury was justified by the facts of the case at the time , and has been more than confirmed by the subsequent career of the unfortunate lady . Miss Harris continued to give positive symptoms of cerebral disorder , and was finally obliged to take shelter in an asylum . It is possible that the decision in the case of Miss Harris was influenced more by her personal appearance and the sympathy that she inspired than by considerations of science and law butt . if so , it is by no means the first instance where justice has been done from the most unjustifiable motives . If the journals give us the real facts in regard to the recent diabolical murder in Eastern Massachusetts , it is clear that the murderer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several of his near relatives were violently insane , and that his own conduct before and after the horrible deed was extremely inconsistent and suspicious . No disease is more markedly hereditary than insanity , and no single act is more decidedly symptomatic of this disease than the commission of crime from which it is not possible to obtain any temporary or permanent advantage . Similar illustrations almost without number might be adduced from the records of crime all over the country . If it be objected , as it may be by some , that the views here advocated would , if logically followed out , lead to the acquittal of many of our criminals , I can only give the familiar reply , that the worst use a man can be put to is to hang him . Confinement is a sure punishment for the really guilty , and a safe probation for the insane . It should be considered , however , that those who are affected with cerebral disease are oftentimes , and to a certain extent , responsible for their condition . When a man commits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him responsible for getting thus intoxicated . Insanity is likewise preventible in many instances , and those who from carelessness or wickedness allow themselves to fall into it , are to that degree responsible for the crime they subsequently commit . But the same can be said of all the diseases from which we suffer , and yet it is the recognized custom of our civilization to treat all cases of sickness-even those which directly result from vice and crime-with as much care and attention as though they were produced by causes entirely beyond the patient 's control . The intuitions of humanity teach us that *sny other course would be unchristian and brutal . In conclusion , I have to speak of the relation of insanity to genius . It was long ago observed that men of original and creative mind were apt to be eccentric , melancholy , and to commit acts that in ordinary individuals would hardly be tolerated . Dr. Morean ( de Tours ) has written a work in which he contends that genius arises from the same organic conditions // as insanity , and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantially amounts to this , that genius , like insanity , is a symptom of disease of the brain . Without conceding all that is claimed by Dr. Moreau , it can not be denied that a very large number of the geniuses of the world have been either melancholic or very eccentric , and , in some instances , have been the victims of violent and repeated attacks of insanity . Dr. Johnson was hypochondriacal , and in various ways gave evidence of a morbid condition of the brain . At the early age of twenty he became the victim of melancholic delusions , and from that time forward was never happy . On one occasion he exclaimed , despairingly , " I would consent to have an arm amputated , to recover my spirits . " Wretchedness like this , when it is temporary or spasmodic , may signify but little ; but when it is persistent and lifelong , it mlist be regarded as the symptom of cerebral disease that may and often does advance to absolute madness . The violent impetuosity of Dr. Johnson , his unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sam&amp;theory . Some of the brightest geniuses in literature have been at intervals subject to attacks of madness . Southey lived for years in perpetual dread of insanity , and when at last he kneeled in the furrow , worn out through mental excitement and fatigue , he composed that most instructive and useful of his works , " The Life of Cowper . " That Rousseau was a lunatic will be admitted without question by those who studied his life and writings , however ardently , they may admire his genius . Pascal was , one of the most original thinkers of France , but no inmate of any asylum ever presented more indisputable proofs of mental disease than those which characterized his whole career . All his life he walked in darkness , knowing not at what he stumbled , in constant fear both of the present and the future . He was the victim of absurd delusions , was harassed by excessive nervousness , and was the slave of uncontrollable eccentricities . On examination after death , his brain was found to be very seriously diseased . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , with a slow and chronic type of cerebral disease . It would be hard , indeed , to find any other theory on which to account for the thousand and one eccentricities and inconsistencies of his enigmatical career . His absurd fear of women was certainly full evidence of monomania , but when we take this fact in connection with his life-long melancholy , his early and repeated attempts at self-destruction , his unnatural ingratitude to those who befriended him in distress , and his anomalous love of solitude , we find it impossible to accept any other interpretation of his life than that he was never an absolutely sane and responsible being . The poet Cowper declared expressly that he translated Homer in order to relieve his wretchedness , and we are led to believe from the facts of his biography , that if he had been a happy man he would not have been a poet . Some of his finest poems were written while he was suffering the bitterest form of melancholy . Burton wrote his " Anatomy of Melancholy " out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great positive philosopher , August Comte , was attacked with insanity in 1826 , and for one year was compelled to withdraw from his usual duties . Two years afterwards he published the work on " Positive Philosophy " that has immortalized his name . Haller , the distinguished physiologist , was a religious monomaniac , and , in the latter part of his life , he sought relief in opium-eating . Swedenborg was a lYlliant writer and thinker , but he was subject to hallucinations that are never experienced by those of sound mind . His fantastic visions of heaven and hell , and his imagined interviews with the Almighty , find their counterparts in the experience of many in our asylums . Cardinal de Richelieu was subject to maniacal attacks , during which he lost all his self-control , and behaved like a // 52* silly child . When the attack was over he had no recollection of what had passed . It is said of Fourier , the chimerical social reformer , that he passed almost his entire life in a state of hallucination . Zimmerman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wretched hypochondriac , and , in the latter portion of his days , was practically insane . Lavater was always characterized by an overplus of enthusiasm , that of itself was symptomatic of an unnatural condition of the brain ; and , as is so often the case with such geniuses , became more and more absurd and inconsistent as he grew older . According to Dr. Moreau , he came to believe that by the power of prayer he could identify himself with Christ . I think it may be said in general that all those who unagine themselves to be angels or gods , or that they visit heaven or hell , and have direct revelations from the AlA mighty , are to an extent insane , however brilliant and rational they may be in all other particulars . Therefore Francis d'Assisse , who passed days and nights in communication with God , Francis Xavier , to whom Saint Jerome appeared in a vision , Savonarola , who fought with imaginary demons and professed to have revelations from Heaven , are to be classed among the religiously insane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cerebral disease , and was only a remarkable symptom of organic conditions that in various degrees of advancement are to be found in everyday life . Tasso was a positive maniac , and , like many other unbalanced geniuses , believed that he was attended by a. familiar spirit . " I shall die at the top first , " ejaculated Dean Swift , as he sadly gazed on a tree whose branches were decaying ; and he realized his terrible prediction . He was more or less insane during all his active life . Beethoven was one of the most despairing of hypochondriacs ; and the gifted poet Collins was at tjmes a sad and moaning lunatic . The eccentricities and melancholy of Lord Byron were probably the uncontrollable manifestations of disease , and during his short and brilliant career he gave sufficient evidence of insanity to more than justify the suspicions of his wife at the time of their separation . Voltaire was precocious , brilliant , and original ; but the general conduct of his life can hardly be made consistent with perfect soundness of mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proverb , and has from time to time been applied to a number of eccentric geniuses . It was applied to Nathaniel Lee , who was for a time confined in Bethlehem Hospital , in England , and to McDonald Clarke , in our own country . Lucretius wrote his celebrated " lie l ? erum Hatura " while suffering frcan an attack of insanity , and Cruden compiled his " Concordance " while in the same mental condition . Madame de Stael had a masculine and powerful intellect , but she was a slave to idle fears . and silly eccentricities , that in ordinary persons would certainly have been regarded as symptoms of disease of the brain . Nothing seems clearer than that the irritability , hypochondria , and meanness of Alexander Pope were the results of organic cerebral conditions which he could no more control than he could remedy his physical deformity . Lady Stanhope and Balzac , Hood and Chatterton , all displayed eccentricities that are hard to be reconciled with perfect sanity , and the latter , as is well known , . died by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were known how much that is interest : ing and valuable both in our ephemeral and our permanent literature is the work of minds partially insane . A few years since considerable excitement was occasioned by the report that many of the editorials of one of our daily journals were written by the inmate of an asylum . The story itself may not have been literally true , in the instance there addnced , but it was based on probability , nay , on actual fact . Some time since one of the most prominent of our magazines published an essay of great interest and value that was prepared by one of the inmates of an insane-retreat. // Says Dr. Winslow , " Some of the ablest articles in Aiken 's Biography ' were written by a patient in a lunatic asylum . " Instances are recorded where attacks of insanity have been accompanied by extraordinary and marvellous manifestations of intellectual power . I qnote a few typical cases from the valuable work of Dr. Winslow on the " Mind and Brain . " " A young gentleman had an attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This youth had never exhibited any particular talent for arithmetic or mathematical science ; in fact , it was alleged that he was incapable of doing a simple sum in addition or multiplication . After recovering from his maniacal attack , and when able to occupy his mind in reading and conversation , it was discovered that an e traordi y arithmetical p er had been evolved . He was able with wonderful facility , to solve rather complex problems . This talent continued for several months , but after his complete restoration to health , he relapsed into his former nati.tral state of arithmetical dulness , ignorance , and general mental incapacity . " Dr. Rush , quoted by this same authority , declares that " talents for eloquence , poetry , music , painting , and uncommon ingenuity in several of the mechanic arts , are often evolved in this state of madness . * * A female patient who became insane sang hymns and songs of her own composition during the latter stage of her illness , with a tone and voice so pleasant that I hung upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never discovered a talent for poetry or music in any previous part of her life . Two instances of a talent for drawing evolved by madness have occurred within my knowledge . " Similar though perhaps less striking instances have been observed by all who are conversant with insanity . In view of all these facts it seems to be clear that the familiar verse , " great wit to madness is allied , " is the literal ex pression of a scientific truth , and that certain types and conditions of cerebral disease give rise to unnatural activity and brilliancy of the intellect . Recurring to our original illustration , we know that some morbid conditions of the digestive apparatus and of the general system-such , for instance , as appear in epilepsy-are attended by a most unnatural appetite and power of digestion . This theory-which is amply sustained by analogy-also accounts for the extraordinary mental phenomena that are experienced by those who are nearly drowned , and for the supernatural visions and ecstacies of those who are on the point of death . This same theory also helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a magnetic sleep , or in the so-called clairvoyant state . Admitting all that has been claimed in this essay , it is evident that our asylums contain but a very small minority of those who are affected with disease of the brain . The insane are all about us , on every hand , and fulfil with success the various relations of life . We find them at the bar , in the pulpit , in legislative halls , and on the throne ; among our laborers , our artisans , our husbandmen , our merchants , and especially among our poets , scholars , and men of letters . To isolate these unfortunates from society , in the confinement of an asylum , would , in the great majority of cases , be unjustifiable , and especially so since recent experiments have clearly shown that lunatics of all kinds may be successfully treated in the quiet of country homes . But if it were thoroughly understood and appreciated by the profession and the laity , that the milder and subtle phases of insanity are thus frequent among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crimes to which they give origin , and much might be done to modify or prevent their evil consequences to individuals and to society .
