COMMUNICATION . WHETHER virtue can be taught is a question over which Plato lingers long . And it is a curious illustration of the dif .. ferent eyes with which different men read , that some students of Plato are confident he answers the question in the affirinative , while others are equally sure that he gives it an unqualified negative . " Plato , " says Schwegler , " holds fast to the opinion that virtue is science , and therefore to be imparted by instruction . " " We are told , " says Burgess , one of Bohn 's translators , " that , as virtue is not a science , it can not , like a science , be made a subject of teaching . " Professor Blackie , again , an open-minded and eloquent scholar , can not doubt that virtue may be verbally imparted , nor , therefore , that the great Athenian thinker so believed and affirmed What is the voice of common sense and the teaching of history touching this matter ? Can a liberal and lofty nature be included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elevation of character , nobility of spirit , wealth of soul ,  --  is any method known , or probably ever to be known , among men , whereby these can be got into a text - book , and then out of the text-book into a bosom wherein they had no dwelling before ? Alas , is not the story of the world too full of cases in which the combined eloquence of verbal instruction , vital influence , and lustrous example , aided even by all the inspirations of the most majestic and moving presence , bave failed utterly to shape the character of disciples ? Did Alcibiades profit greatly by the conversation of Socrates ? Was Judas extremely ennobled by the companionship of Jesus ? Was it to any considerable purpose that the pureminded , earnest , affluent Cicero strewed the seeds of Stoic culture upon the wayside nature of his son ? Did Faustina learn much from Antoninus Pius , or Cornruodus from Marcus Aurelius ?

The broad , unequivocal sentence of history seems to be that whoever is not noble by nature will hardly be rendered so by art . Education can do much ; it can foster nobilities , it can discourage vices ; but literal conveyance of lofty qualities , can it effect that ? Can it create opulence of soul in a sterile nature ? Can it cause a thin soil to do the work of a deep one ? We have seen harsh natures mellowed , violent natures chastened , rough ones refined ; but who has seen an essentially mean nature made large - hearted , self-forgetful , fertile of grandest faiths and greatest deeds ? Who has beheld a Thersites transformed into an Achilles ? Who a Shylock , Ingo , or Regan changed into an Antonio , Othello , or Cordelia , or a Simon Magus into a Paul ? What virtue of nature is in a man culture may bring out ; but to put nature into any man surpasses her competence . Nay , it would even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what is best in man must operate inversely , and elicit only what is worst in him . Every profoundest truth , when uttered with fresh power in history , polarizes men , accumulating atheism at one pole , while collecting faith and resolve at the other . As the sun bleaches some surfaces into whiteness , but tans and blackens others , so the sweet shining of Truth illumines some countenances with belief , but some it darkens into a scowl of hate and denial . The American Revolution gave us George Washington ; but it gave us also Benedict Arnold . One and the same great spiritual emergency in Europe produced Luther 's Protestantism and Loyola 's Jesuitism . Our national crisis has converted General Butler ; what has it done for Yallandi0hain ? It were easy to show that the deepest // intelligence of the world concurs with common sense in this judgment . Its declaration ever is , in effect , that , though Paul plant and Apollos water , yet fruit can come only out of divine and infinite Nature , - only , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul . " No man can come to me , " said Jesns , " except the Father draw him . " " To him that bath shall he given . " The frequent formula , " He that hath ears to hear , let him hear , " is a confession that no power of speech , no wisdom of instruction , can command results . The grandest teacher , like the humblest , can but utter his word , sure that the wealthy and prepared spirits will receive it , and equally sure that shallow , sterile , and inane natures will either not receive it at all , or do so to extremely little purpose . And such , as I read , is the judgment of Plato ; though , ever disposed to explore the remote possibilities of education , he discusses the subject in a tentative spirit , as if va*uely hoping that more might , through some discovery in method , be accomplished by means of doctrine . But in the " Repuhlic " his permanent persuasion is shown . He there bases his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of " Wilhelm Meister " bases his scheme of education , upon a primary inspection of natures , in which it is assumed that culture must begin by humbly accepting the work of Nature , forswearing all attempt to add one jo* or tittle to the native virtue of any human spirit . It is always , however , less important for us to know what another thinks upon any high matter than to know what is our own deepest and inevitable thought concerning it ; for , as the man himself thinketh , not as another tliinketh for him , so is he : his own thoughts are forces and engines in his nature ; those of any other are at best but candidates for these profound effects . I propose , therefore , that we throw open the whole question of man 's benefit to man by means of words . Let us inquire-if possible , with somewhat of coura c and vigor - what are the limits and what the laws of instructive communication . And our first discovery will be that such communication has . adamantine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably be that we are able to make literal conveyance of our thought . But , in truth , one could as soon convey the life out of his veins into the veins of another as transfer from his own mind to that of another any belief , thought , or perception whatsoever . Words are simply the signs , they are not the vehicles , of thought . Like all signs , they convey nothing , but only suggest . Like all signs , they are intelligible to none but the initiated . One man , having a certain mental experience , hoists , as it were , a signal , like ship* at sea , whereby he would make suggestion of it to another ; and if in the mental experience of that other be somewhat akin to this , which , by virtue of that kindred , can interpret its symbol , then only , and to the extent of such interpretation , does communication occur . But the mental experience itself , the thought itself , does not pass ; it only makes the sign . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it conveys nothing out of my mind into the mind of you , the reader ; it simply appeals to your conception of divinity . If I attempt to explain , then every word of the explanation must be subject to the same conditions ; not one syllable of it can do more than merely appeal to somewhat already in your mind . For instance , suppose I say , God is love ; what then is done ? The appeal is shifted to another sign ; that is all . What my own soul , fed from the vital resources and incited by the vital relationships of my life , has learned of love , that my thought may connect with the word ; but of all this nothing passes when it is uttered ; and the sound , arriving at your ear , can do no more than invite you to summon and bring before the eye of your consciousness that which your own soul , out of its divine depths and through the instruction of vital relationship , has learned and has privily whispered to you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as each one , in the inviolable solitudes of his own consciousness , has learned to connect with this , or with any great word , just that , and never a grain more , it can summon . And if endeavor be made to explain any such by others , the explanation can come no nearer ; it can only send words to your ear , each of which performs its utmost office by inviting you to call up and bring before your cognizance this or that portion of your mental experience . But always what answers the call is your mental experience , no less yours , no less wedded to your life , than the blood in your arteries ; it can not be that of any other . And the same is true , or nearly the same , respecting the most obvious outside matters . Suppose one to make merely this statement , I see a house . Now , if the person addressed has ever had experience of the act of vision , if he has ever seen anything , he will know what see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ever seen a house , he will know what house denotes ; not otherwise . Or suppose , that , not knowing , he ask what a house is , and that the first speaker attempt to explain by telling him that it is such and such a structure , built of brick , wood , or stone ; then it is assumed that he has seen stone , wood , or brick , that he has seen the act of building , or at least its result ; - and in fine , the explanation , every syllable of it , can do no more than appeal to perceptions of which the questioner is assumed to have had experience . We do , indeed , gain an approximate knowledge of things we have never seen . For example , I have an imperfect notion of a banian - tree , though I have never seen one ; but it is only by having seen other trees , and by having also had the perceptions to which appeal is made in describing the peculiarities of the banian . So he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objects as the senses of touch , hearing , smell , and taste can impart to him ; and he may profit by verbal information to such extent as these perceptions enable him . But the perception itself , and so thought , faith , and in fine all mental experience whatsoever , whether of high order or low , whether relating to objects within us or to objects without , take place only in the privacy of our own minds , and are in their substance not to be transferred . Observe with precision what is here said . The mental experience of each man , if it be of any spiritual depth , has transacted itself in his nature in virtue , to a most important degree , of spiritual relationship with other human beings . There never was an act of development in any man 's soul that did not imply a humanity , and involve the virtue of social affinity . I should be dumb , but for the ears of others ; I should be deaf , that is , my human ear would be closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particle of human energy , and no tint of human coloring , for which we are not , in part , indebted to vital human fellowship . Nevertheless , of this experience , though in the absence of social conifection it could not have occurred , not one jot nor tittle can be made over to another by means of words . It can hoist its verbal signal , and the like experience in other souls may interpret the sign ; it can do no more . Men may , indeed , commune ; that is. they may by verbal conference enter mutually into a sense of an already cxisting unity of inward experience ; and there are other and eminent uses of words , of which more anon ; but here let it be noted with sufficient emphasis that of minds there can he no mixture , and that speech can make no substantive conveyance of any mental product from one mind to another . Each soul must draw from its native fountains ; though we must never forget that without conversation and social relationship its divine thirst would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all warmest and quickest verity of social nearness , there is a kind of sacred and inviok ble solitude of the soul . We speak across to each other , as out of different planets // in heaven ; and the closest intimacy of * souls is like that of double stars which revolve about each other , not like that of two lumps of clay which are squeezed and confounded together . So much , then , concerning the limits of verbal communication . Words , we say , are not vehicles . No perception , no mental possession , passes from mind to mind . You can impart to another no piece of knowledge whose main elements were not already in his mind , no thought which was not substantially existent in his consciousness before your voice began to seek his ear . Instructors may , indeed , put a pupil in the way to obtain fresh perceptions , and more rarely a wise man may put an apt disciple in the way to obtain deeper insights ; but , aft er all , the learner must learn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of body or of soul ; and he must behold it as it is in itself , not merely as it is in words . Hence the new scheme of school-education . Agassiz says , in substance ,  --  " If you would teach a boy geography , take him out on the hills , and make the earth herself his instructor . If you would teach him respectin* tigers or turtles , show him tiger or turtle . Take him to a Museum of Natural lEstory ; let him always , so far as possible , learn about facts from the facts themselves . " Judicious and important advice . And the basis of it we find in what has been set forth above , namely , that words convey no perception , whether of physical or of spiritual truth . It follows , therefore , that only he whose soul is eloquent within him will gain much from any eloquence of his fellow . Only he whose heart is a prophet will hear the prophet . A divine preparation of the nature , divine activities of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Demosthenes or Phillips speak , it is the hearer 's own spirit that convinces him . Conviction can not be forced upon one from without . Hence the wellknown futility of belligerent controversy . No possible logic will lead a man ahead of his own intelligence ; neither will any take from him the persuasions which correspond to his mental condition . A good logical pose may sometimes serve to lower the crest of an obstreperous sophist , as boughs of one species of ash are said to quell the rattlesnake ; but with both these sinuous animals the effect is tempor*pry , and the quality of the creature ren*iains unchanged . Even though one be sincerely desirous of advancing his intelligence , it is seldom , as Mr. Emerson has somewhere said , of much use for him to carry his questions to another . lie of whom insight is thus asked may be sage , eloquent , apt to teach ; but it will commonly be found , nevertheless , that his words , for some reason , do not seem to suit the case in hand : admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogous to this , it may be for all such cases , and it is a thousand pities that the present one does not come within their scope ; but this , as ill luck will have it , is that other case which they do not fit . And yet , despite these iron limits , communication is not only one of the especial delights , but also one of the chief uses , of human life . As every spiritual activity implies fellowship , so does almost every thought , almost every result of spiritual activity , imply some speech of our fellows . Voices and books , - who would be himself without them ? I do not believe myself to have now in my mind one valuable thought which owes nothing to the written or spoken thought of other men , living or dead . How , then , is it that the speech of our fellows renders us aid ? What are to us the uses of the words of others ? And here be it first of all frankly ac. * knowl*dged , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered , which yet serves good ends . There is much speech whose office is simply to refresh the sense of fellowship . It will not make a good lending article ; but the leading article which subserves equal uses is not to he contemned . So much are men empowered by each other , that any careless , kindly chat which gives them 1864.1 427 // the sense of cordial nearness gives also warmth and invigoration . Better than most ambitions conversation is the light , happy , bubbling talk which means at bottom simply this - " We are at home together ; we believe in each other . " Words are good , if they only festoon love and trust . Words are good , if they merely show us that worthy natures do not suspect us , do not lock their closets when we are in the house , do not put their souls in dress-costume to meet us , but leave their thoughts and hearts naked in our presence , and are not ashamed . Be it mine sometimes to sit with my friend when our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both to be so utterly eloquent , that , without silence , we forbear to set up any rivalry to them by grave and meditated speech ,  --  observing , it may be , a falling leaf toyed with by the wind , and speaking words that drop from the lips like falling leaves , and float down a zephyr that knows not which way to blow . Some of the sweetest and most fruitful hours of life are these in which we speak half-articulate nothings , merely airing the sense of fellowship , and so replete with this wealth of vital intimacy that we have room for nothing more . But our aim is to regard communication as an instruction , and to consider the more explicit and definite uses of words . And of these the first , and one of the chief , is based upon the very limitations which have been set forth , - upon the very fact that words are not vehicles . I have said that there is a certain divine solitude of the soul ; and of this solitude the uses are infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeks to insphere itself in each person , though in each giving elf a peculiar or individual representation ; and only as this inspherin* takes place are the ends of creation attained , only so is man made indeed a human life . Therefore must we draw out of that , out of that alone ; therefore truth is permitted to come to us only out of these infinite depths , albeit incitement , invitation , and the ability to draw from these native fountains may be due to social connection . Because our life is really enriched only as the absolute soul gives itself to us , therefore will it suffer us no other iso than by its gift to supply our want . And as it can not give itself to us save in response to a felt want , a seeking , an inward demand , it belongs to the chief economies of our life to bring us to this attitude of inward request , to this call and claim upon the resources of our intelligence . INow words come to us as empty vessels , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose a requisition upon the perpetual contents of reason , conscience , and imagination , we open a valve through which new spiritual powers enter , and add themselves to our being . If the word God be sometimes spoken simply and spontaneously , a youth who hears it will be sure upon some day , when the sense of the infinite and divine stirs vaguely within him , to ask himself what this word means , to require his soul to tell him what is the verity corresponding thereto ; and precisely this requisition is what the soul desires , for only when sought may its riches be found . The utilities of words in this kind are deserving of very grave estimation . Words teach us much , but they teach less by what is is them than by what is not in them ,  --  less by what they give to us than by what they demand from us . It is , therefore , one of the grand services of communication to bring us to the limits of communication , making us feel , that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us new stretches of thought , new energies of hope , faith , and all noble imagining . It were well , therefore , that , among other things , we should sometimes thank God for our ignorance and weakness , - thank Him for what we do not understand and are not equal to ; for with every fresh recognition of these , with every fresh approach to the borders of our intelligence , we are prepared for new requisitions upon the soul . As in a pump the air is exhausted in order that the water may rise , so a void in our intelligence // caused by its own energy precedes every enrichment . Hence he who will not admit to his heart the sense of ignorance will always he a fool ; he who is perpetually filled with self-sufliciency will never be filled with much else . And from this point of view one may discern the significance of that doctrine of humility which belongs equally to Socratic thinking and Christian believing . It follows , too , that we need not laboriously push and foist upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital influence , which is a powerful propagandist , our simple , natural , inevitable speech will cause them to do much better than learn from us , it will cause them to learn from their own souls . And however uncertain may be a harvest from questions asked of others , a great question rightly put to one 's self not only must he fruitful , but carries in it a capacity for infinite fruitfulness ; while the longer and more patiently and persistently one can wait for an answer , the richer his future is to he . I am sure of him who can put to his heart the great questions of life , and wait serenely and yigilantly for a response , one , two , ten years , a lifetime , wellaigh an eternity , if need be , not falling into despondencies and despairing skepticisms because the universe forbears to babble and tattle its secret ere yet he half or a thousandth part guesses how deep and holy that secret is , but quietly , heroically askin* and waiting . And toward this posture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard ,  --  which is their first eminent use to us . Secondly , they serve us greatly , when they simply cause a preexisting community of thought to be mutually recognized . It is much to bring like to like , brand to brand , believing soul to believin , soul . As several pieces of anthracite coal will together make a powe ; ful heat , but separately will not burn at *dl , so in the conjunction of similar faiths md beliefs there is a wholly new effect ; it is not at all the mere sum of the forces preViously in oper Communication . 429 ation , but a pure product of union . " My confidence in my own belief , " said Novalis , " is increased infinitely the moment another shares it with me . The reason is obvious . You and I have grown up apart , and have never conferred together ; our temperaments , culture , circumstances are different ; we have come to have certain thoughts which seem to us true and deep , but each of us doubts whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , position , and influence . But to-day we come together , and discover , that , despite these outward diversities in which we are so widely unlike , our fundamental faiths are one and the same ; the same thoughts , the same beliefs have sprun* into life in our separate souls . Instantly is suggested a unity underlying our divided being , a law of thought abiding in mind itself , - not merely in your mind or mine , but in the mind and soul of man . What we arrive at , therefore , is not merely the sum of you and me , the aggregate of two men 's opinions , but the universal , the absolute , and spiritually necessary . Such is always the suggestion which spontaneous unity of faith carries with it ; hence it awakens religion , and gives total peace and rest . " But the faiths which are to be capable of these divine embraces must indeed be spontaneous and native . Hence those who create factitious unity of creed render these fructifications impossible . If we agree , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us the same word , but because we have both been fed with dust out of the same catechism , our unity will disgust and weary us rather than invi*orate . Dr. Johnson said he would n compel men to believe as he and the Church of England did , " because , " he reasoned , " if another differs from me , he weakens my confidence in my own scheme of faith , and so injures me . " Now this speech is good just so far as it asserts social dependence in belief ; it is bad , it is idiotic or insane , so far as it advocates the substitution of a factitious and artificial unity for one of spiritual depth // and reality . The fruits of the tree of life are not to he successfully thieved . In dishonest hands they become ashes and bitterness . He who has more faith in an Act of Parliament than in God and the universe may he a good conventional believer ; hut , in truth , the choice he makes is the essence of all denial and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , bring up out of his own soul its pnrest , broadest , simplest faith and when any ten or ten thousand find that the same faith has come to birth in their several souls , each one of them all will be exalted to a divine confidence , and will make new requisitions upon the soul which he has so been taught to trust . Thus , though we tell each nothing new , though we merely demonstrate our unity of consciousness , yet is the force of each many times multiplied ,  --  dimless certitude and dauntless courage being bred in hearts where before , perhaps , were timorous hesitation and wavering . The third service of words may be compared to the help which the smith renders to the fire on his forge . True it is that no blowing can enkindle dead coals , and make a flame where was no spark . True it is that both spark and bellows will be vain , if the fuel is stone or clay . And so no blowing will enkindle a nature which does not bring in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may support it . But in our being , as at the forge , the flame that languishes may be taught to leap , and the spark that was hidden may be wrought into blaze . Simple attraction and encouragement , - there is somewhat of the marvellous in their effects . Physiologists tell us , that , if two liquids in the body are separated by a moist membrane , and if one of these fluids be in motion and the other at rest , that which rests will of its own accord force its way through the membrane and join the one which flows . So it is in history . Any man who represents a spiritual streaming will command and draw into the current of his soul those whose condition is one of stagnancy or arrest . Now courage and belief are streamings forward ; skepticism and timidity are stagnancies ; panic , fear , and destructive denial are streamings backward . True , now , it is , that any swift flowing , forward or backward , attracts ; but progressive or affirmative currents have this vast advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humanity in every man 's being believes in them and belongs to them ; and they accordingly are like rivers , which , however choked up temporarily and made refluent , are sure in the end to foxce their way ; while negative and backward currents are like pestilences and conflagrations , which of necessity limit themselves by exhaustion , if not mastered by happier means . We may , indeed , note it as a nicety , that the membrane must he moist through which this transudation is to take place ; and I admit that there are men whose enveloping sheath of individualism and egotism is so hard and dry , so little interpenetrated by candor and the love of truth , as to be nearly impervious to noble persuasion ; and were whole Missouris of tidings from the highest intelligence rushing past them , they would still yawn , and say , " Do you get any news ? " as innocently as ever . Nevertheless , history throbs with the mystery of this influence . A little girl sleeping by her mother 's side awoke in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother , and shrinking into the smallest possible space , said , trembling , " Mother , are you afraid ? " " No , my dear , " answered the lady , calmly . " Oh , well , " said the child , assuming her full proportions , and again disposing herself for sleep , " if you re not afraid , I m not afraid , " and was soon slumbering quietly . What volumes of gravest human history in that little mcident ! So infinitely easy are daring and magnanimity , so easy is transcendent height of thought and will , when exalted spiritually , when imperial valor and purpose breathe and blow upon our souls from the lips of a living fellow ! Not , it may be , that anything new is said . // That is not required . What another now thrills , inspires , transfigures us hy saying , we probably knew before , only dared not let ourselves think that we knew it . The universe , perhaps , had not a nook so hidden that therein we could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hearts . But now some childlike man stands up and speaks it to the common air , in serenest unconsciousness of doing anything sin*ular . He has said it ,  --  and lo , he lives ! By the help of God , then , we too , by word and deed , will utter our souls . Get one hero , and you may have a thousand . Create a grand impulse in history , and no fear but it will be reinforced . Obtain your champion in the cause of Right , and you shall have indomitable armies that charge for social justice . More of the highest life is suppressed in every one of us than ever gets vent ; and it is this inward suppression , after making due account of all outward oppressions and injuries , which constitutes the chief tragedy of history . Daily men cast to the ground the proffered beakers of heaven , from mere fear to drink . Daily they rebuke the divine , inarticulate murmur that arises from the deeps of their being , - inarticulate only because denied and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain pure intrepidity those suggestions which haunt forever the hearts of men . No greater blunder , accordingly , was ever made than that of attempting to render men brave and helieviu* by addressing them as cowards and infidels . Garibaldi stands up before his soldiers in Northern Italy , and says to them , ( tliou*h I forget the exact words , ) " I do not call you to fortune and prosperity ; I call you to hardship , to sufferin* , to death ; I ask you to give your toil without reward , to spill your blood and lie in unknown graves , to sacrifice all for your country and kind , and hear no thanks but the Well done of God in heaven . " Did they cower and go back ? Ere the words had spent their echoes , every man 's will was as the living adamant of God 's purpose , and every man 's hand was as the hand of Destiny , and from the shock of their onset the Austrians fled as from the opening jaws of an earthquake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew upon the people 's hearts with their own best thoughts ; and what a blaze ! True , the divine fuel was nearly goiie , Athens well nigh burnt out , and the flame lasted not long ; but that he could produce such effects , when half he fanned was merest ashes , serves all the more to show how great such effects may be . Before passing to the last and profoundest use of communication , I must not omit to mention that which is most obvious , but not most important , - the giving of ordinary informations and instructions . These always consist in a suggestion to another of new combinations of his notions , new societies in his mind . Thus , if I say , Fire burns , I simply assert a connection between fire and burning , - the notion of both these being assumed as existing in the mind of the person addressed . Or if I say , God is just , I invite him to associate in his mind the sentiment of justice and the sense of the infinite and omnipotent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we usually confide in the representations of others , and picture to ourselves , so far as our existing perceptions enable us , the combinations they affirm , - provided always these have a certain undefined conformity with our own experience . But in respect to association , not of mere notions , but of spiritual elements in the soul , - of truths evolved by the spiritual nature of man , - the case is quite different . Thus , if the fool who once said in his heart , " There is no God , " should now say openly , ( of course by some disguising euphemism , ) " God is an egotist , " I may indeed shape an opinion accordingly , and fall into great coiifusion in consequence ; but my spiritual nature does not consent to this representation ; no real association takes place within 0 // me between the sense of the divine and the conception of egotism . Such opinion may have immense energy in history , but it has no efficiency in the eliciting and outbuilding of our personal being ; these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , serve us inwardly only to such de* ee as our spiritual nature can ally itself with them and find expression in them . It is simply impossible for any man to associate the idea of divinity with the conception of selfishness ; but he may associate the notion of Zeus or Allah or the like with that or any other conception of baseness , and out of the result may form a sort of crust over his spiritual intelligence , which shall either imprison it utterly , or force it to oblique and covert expression . And of this last , by the way , - and we may deeply rejoice over the fact , - history is full . Yet in this suggestion toward new societies in the soul , in this formal introduction to each other of kindred elements in the consciousness , there may be eminent service . It is only formal , it does not make friendship , it leaves our spirits to their own action ; but it may prepare the way for inward unities and communities whose blessedness neither speech nor silence can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profounder and more creative than any of these . As a brand which burns powerfully may at last ignite even green wood , so divine faiths , alive and awake in one soul , may appeal to the mere elements , to mere possibilities , of such faiths in other souls , and at length evoke them by that appeal . The process is slow ; it requires a celestial heat and persistency in the moving spirit ; it is one of the " all things " that are possible only with God : but it occurs , and it is the most sacred and precious thing in history . Every human soul has the absolute soul , has the whole truth , significance , and virtue of the universe , as its lawful and native resource . Therefore says Jesus , " The kingdom of heaven is within you " ; therefore Antoninus , " Look inwards , within is the fountain of truth " ; therefore Eckart , " Ye have all truth potentially within you . " All ideas of truth dwell in every soul , hut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in an infinite depth of sleep ; while the base incense of brutish lives is like chloroform , or the fumes of some benumbing drug , to steep them ever more and more in oblivion . But to awaken truth thus sleeping in the soul is the highest use of discipline , the noblest aim of culture , and the most eminent service which man can render to man . The scheme of our life is providentially arranged with reference to that end ; and the thousand shocks , agitations , and moving influences of our experience , the supreme invitations of love , the venom of calumny , and all toil , trial , sudden bereavement , doubt , danger , vicissitude , joy , are hands that shake and voices that assail the lethargy of o r deepest powers . Now it is in the power of truth divinely awakened in one soul to assist its awakening in another . For as nothing so quickly arouses us from slumber a hearing ourselves called upon by name , so is it with this celestial inhabitant : whoever by virtue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit to be stirred and his slumber to be broken . Let him , therefore , in whom any great truth is alive and awake , enunciate , proclaim it steadily , clearly , cheerily , with a serene and cloudless passion ; and wherever a soul less mature than his own lies open to the access of his tones , there the eye-fast angels of belief and knowledge shall hear that publication of their own hearts , and , hearing , lift their lids , and rise into wakefulness and power . Seldom , indeed , is a iy voice , though it be in its origin a genuine voice of the soul , pure and impartial enough , enough delivered from the masks of egotism and accident , to be greatly competent for these e ects . Besides which , there are not a few that have closed their ears , lest they should hear , not a few that are even filled with base astonishment and terror , // and out of this with base wrath , to find their deafness assailed . And still further , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and though one desire openness of soul as much as folly fears it , yet may it happen that some tint of peculiarity in the tone of a worthy voice shall render it to him opaque and unintelligible . Yet let us not fear that the product of any sacred and spiritual sincerity will fail of sufficient uses . If a deep , cordial , and clarified nature will but give us his heart in a pure and boundless bravery of confession ,  --  if , like autumn plants , that cast forth their seeds , winged with down , to the four winds of heaven , or like the blossoms of spring and early summer , that yield up their preciousness of pollen to the forage of bees , and even by being so robbed attain to the hearts of neighborblossoms , and accomplish that mystery of fructification which is to make glad the maturer year , - if so this infiorescence of eternity that we name a Noble Man will yield up the golden pollen of his soul , even to those that in visiting him seek but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winged words , words that are indeed spiritual seeds , purest , ripest , and most vital products of his being , to the winds of time , - he will be sure to reach some , and they to reach others , and there is no telling how far the seminal effect may go there is no telling what harvests may yellow in the limitless fields of the future , what terrestrial and celestial reapers may go home re joicing , bearing their sheaves with them , what immortal hungers may be fed at the feasts of earth and heaven , in final consequence of that lonely and faithful sowing . As in the still mornings of summer the earliest awakened bird hesitates to utter , yet utters , his solitary pipe , timidly rippling the silence , but is not long alone , for quickly the melodious throb begins to beat in every tree-top , and soon the whole rapturous grove gushes and palpitates into song , - even so , thus to appearance alone and unsupported , begins that chant of belief which is destined to heave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over a world . Thus does a faith that has lain long silent in the hearts of nations suddenly answer to the note of its kind , astonishing all bystanders , astonishing most of all the heart it inhabits . For , lo ! the tree-tops of human life are full of slumbering melodies , and if a song-sparrow pipe sincerely on the hill-sides of Judea , saying , after his own fashion of speech , " Behold , the divine d* wn hath visited my eyes , " be sure that the forests of far-off America , then unknown , will one day reply , and ten thousand thousand throats throbbing with high response will make it mutually known all round the world that this auroral beam is not for any single or private eye , but that the broad amber beauty of spiritual morning belongs to man 's being , and that in man 's heart , by virtue of its perennial nature , is prophesied the day whose sun shall be God and its earth heaven .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
