CONTINENTAL MONTHLY : DEVOTED TO LITERATURE AND NATIONAL POLICY . VoL . V.-JUNE , 1864. - No . VI . ERNEST RENAN 'S THEORY . CHRISTIANITY is a fact . We sometimes hear of men who are said to deny ' Christianity . ' The expression is nonsense . Men can not deny the sun . Christianity has been a visible thing , on this planet , for eighteen hundred years . It has done a heavy amount of work , which is very visible too . It is altogether too late in the day to deny Christianity . ' That is the first thing to be understood . There is no arguing against the fact . You must take the fact and make the best of it . If your theory requires the annihilation of the fact , it 's a bad thing for your theory , for the fact insists on staying . What an amount of fearfully laborious stupidity we would have been saved , if only that plain principle had been remembered ! Christianity has stood face to face with the world , for ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of tremendous arms it has worked , fought , endured , conquered , destroyed , builded , all over the earth . It has burned its brand into time . It has stamped its footprints in fire and brightness on earth and sea . It so stands , a great , wonderful , triumphant , flaming fact , blazing through the ages , flamvoL. v.-41 ing to the stars , melting , moulding , enlightening humanity . The first thing to be remembered , then , by Christian and unbeliever alike , when they come to speak of Christianity , is that these things are not the matters in debate . They are the facts to be explained , to be accounted for . In all argument they themselves must first be taken for granted . That is to say , here is this religion , certainly to any thoughtful man the most wonderful thing , take it all in all , that history has to tell about . It starts in an obscure corner of an obscure province . Its founder dies as a felon among felons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialect of an almost unknown tongue . Its whole origin is barbarous , ignorant , disgraceful by any worldly judgment . So it begins . As it spreads , imperial Rome takes alarm , and turns to crush the barbarous fanaticism , in the pride of her learning , civilization , and power . She plants her iron heel on the neck of the creeping sect . She presses it down with her gigantic weight . Time passes . The little sect that began in an obscure city of an obscure province , the number of the names together being an // hundred and twenty , ' in less than three centuries masters the world 's crowned mistress , and plants its standard in triumph , to remain forever* on the Seven Eternal Hills . Resistless Rome is beaten to her knees , every national reverence , every national divinity trampled on , and spit upon , and the barbarous and disgraceful sect sets its ignominious mark , the cross of the condemned slave , on every monument of Roman reverence , on every trophy of Roman greatness . There never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a material hand or weapon , domineers over the greatest empire under the sun , in spite of the whole power of that empire armed to crush it . And , after Rome fell , the huge carcass beaten to the dust , and torn to fragments by the wild creatures that hung upon her borders , this wondrous mystery , this barbarous , obscure faith alone remained , invincible among the powers of Rome . Roman civilization was crushed to the earth , as the Roman legions were . Roman law was trampled out of sight , as Roman art and literature were ; but Christianity stood up and faced the Vandal and the Goth , the Frank and Saxon , as it had faced the C*esars before , and dragged the conquerors of the empire suppliants at the feet of the church . It built a Christian Europe out of the savage hordes of Asia , and made an England , and a Germany , and at last an America out of wild Goth and Ungar , out of bloody Frank and savage Dane . Now all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not add one jot to these facts . My disbelief does not take one tittle from them . So far as they are concerned , every man is a believer in Christianity . He believes it exists . He believes it has existed , has had such and such a history , has produced such and such results . Christian ' and infidel ' alike , to be reasonable , to have any ground for reasonable discussion , go thus far together . They may differ in their explanations of the facts . That is the only ground of difference . There is the point of separation . It is perfectly logical too . Prima fa*ie , we have no complaint to make that they do differ . And here lies the improvement in the modem type of unbeliever . ' He does not take the line of his older brethren , and rudely assail Christianity as a mere imposture with Voltaire and Paine . That sort of work has had its day . He , on the other hand , freely admits its beneficent achievements . He has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a fruitful , beneficent , and conquering fact . He only holds that its existence and its achievements may be accounted for in a far more satisfactory way than we believers ' have discovered . Now all this is comprehensible , and it is really , now , the ground of difference between those who believe in Christianity as divine , and those who hold it to be merely human . It is a clear and simple issue . Christianity accounts for itself and its work on a certain plain , straightforward , and consistent theory . It holds that theory to be reasonable , complete , ample , for all the facts . A number of people join issue just here with Christianity . They admit its facts , but they deny its manner of explaining them . They claim to put forward other methods of explanation , which shall be more reasonable , more natural , and , at the same time , just as ample for the facts . We have had a number of these philosophers , with their theories , and they have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone on about as usual , accepting the old explanation , adopting the old th*ory , a hundred to one , and has dropped the new theories one after another , after more or less investigation , into profound oblivion . Now we are free to admit the old theory has its difficulties . There are things in it hard to be understood . ' There are mysteries and wonders which // it does not attempt to explain . There are hard sayings ' which it leaves hard . And the new theories always claim to have no difficulties . They blame the old one bitterly because it tolerates them . They themselves claim to be reasonable , ' they explain ' everything . They therefore challenge the trial . If they fail to be reasonable , ' or if they can only be reasonable at the expense of some of the facts-that is to say , if they find no place for some of the authentic facts , and so have to explain them away ; or if , on the whole , they make too large drafts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith-we have the logical right to dismiss them out of our presence with scant courtesy , and are bound to hold by the old explanation still . The last man who has come forward with his theory of Christanity is Monsieur Ernest Renan , a Frenchman , a member of the Institute , and a Semitic scholar of some considerable pretensions . He broaches his theory in a book , which he calls The Life of Jesus . ' He offers it to the world , through that book , as an improvement on the accepted one . We propose here to look at NI . Renan 's theory , and see whether it has any advantages to offer over that usually taught in churches in America , and which the present writer learned , some lustra ago , while catechized at the chancel veil , and which his children are learning now . It makes the examination easier that M. IRenan freely and fully admits the achievements of Christianity . Indeed he glories over them . The beneficence of Christianity , its hallowing and elevating power in the history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory it has cast over human life and human aims , the nobleness it has conferred on human character , all these he takes a pride in confessing and appreciating . He will not be a whit behind the stanchest believer in acknowledging the power of these , or in the capacity of prizing these . But he can not accept the explanation Christianity gives of itself . He proposes another of his own . We may take his theory as the fruit and flower of all liberal ' thought . Here , at last , is what unbelieving learning and philosophy have to offer in lieu of the divine origin of Christianity . After a good deal of loud boasting , after a large amount of supercilious sneering , we have here the result of that profound criticism ' and that careful scholarship ' which have been laboring for years , in Europe , to destroy the supernatural bases of faith . We are justified , from M. Renan 's position and character , in taking it for granted , that his book is the best that modern unbelief has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deniers of the divine origin of Christianity can frame . In examining that theory , at the first , a suspicious thing strikes a calm observer . It is the reckless way in which NI . Renan deals with his authorities . For , be it remarked that , with only one or two outside hints in Josephus and Tacitus , the Four Gospels contain all that we know of the Life of Jesus . ' They are formally and professedly His biographies . They were expressly written to present the outlines of His life and teaching in connected form . All that we know of Him , His birth , life , and death , is contained in these four narrations . The utmost learning and the utmost simplicity here stand side by side . The most unlearned reader of Tux CONTINENTAL is just as well informed , with the Four Gospels in his haad , as any member ' of any Academy ' under the sun . Out of these Four Gospels , NI . IRenan has to construct his Life of Jesus . ' But he has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one set forth in the Four Gospels ; so he just rejects whatever goes against his theory , garbles , clips , denies , assents , and colors , with an assurance , amusing for its impudence , if it were not so criminal for its recklessness. *.4n // On the very threshold he asserts , in the teeth of his sole authorities , that Jesus was born in Nazareth ! He refers his startled reader to a footnote . That footnote informs him that the assessment under Quirinus , by which He is sought to be connected with Bethlehem ' took place ten years after . We are to take this on M. Renan 's sole authority . We are to fling the Gospels over on the strength of a footnote ! Now it is simply impossible that NI . Renan can be ignorant that there are very satisfactory ways of explaining this difficulty , otherwise than by charging a forgery . Josephus , whom he cites to prove the assessment to be ten years after , would have informed him that the preliminary enrolment took place at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dominions . Moreover , the authorities for this last fact are not Christian only , as he says . They are Josephus , a Jew , and Suetonius , a pagan . This is only an instance , on the threshold , of what occurs , a hundred times , in the book . Any statement which stands in the way of the writer 's i hypothesis , is swept out of existence at one pen-stroke . Calm historical relations , evidently most essential portions of the writings , are treated as forgeries , or deceptions , without a condescending why or wherefore , if they embarrass the writer . That large portion of the Gospels , the miracles , is scarcely worth a thought from M. Renan . He dismisses the whole question of miracles with a bon mot . Many people followed Jesus into the desert . Thanks to their extreme frugality , they lived there . They naturally believed they saw in that a miracle . ' Now is not that wonderful ! The circumstantial relation of the miraculous feeding is supposed to be satisfactorily explained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But the great miracle of all , the miracle which seals the story , which gives ground of hope and faith to all Christian men , that miracle , without which they have always felt the Gospel would be preached in vain , that grand consummating and awful miracle which flashed brightness into the sepulchre , which shot the light of immortality athwart the darkness of Death , and gave mortal man a sure grasp on immortality , that great crowning miracle , the resurrection of our Lord , on which so much depended , which so many jealous eyes were watching , which was so early asserted on the very spot where it claims to have occurred-this M. Renan treats as unworthy serious refutation . It is not even necessary to try to disprove it . It is simply sufficient for him to mention the strong imagination of Mary Magdalene , ' and to exclaim so beautifully I- ' Divine power of love , sacred moments in which the passion of a hallucinated woman gives to the world a resurrected God ! ' There it is ! The doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for humanity , the doctrine preached always as one of the foundations of the faith ( because he preached unto them Jesus and the resurrection ) , and the fact of the resuxrection , the fact always put forth as the clinching argument , the justification of the whole story , thrown into the face of Jew and Greek as a perpetual challenge-this doctrine and this fact are disposed of by a bit of sickly sentiment ! Now , this sort of thing may be very rhetorical , and very beautiful , when done up in approved , sentimental French , but it is certainly neither logical nor philosophical . We have a right to insist that M. Renan shall come with no theory which compels him to reject half the facts unexamined , and to garble and misuse half the rest . Those facts stand on the same ground as all the others . The same authority which tells us that Christ lived at Nazareth , tells us also that He fed five thousand with five loaves and two small fishes . M. Renan accepts the first statement , // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He does this because he has made up his mind beforehand that pri*na facie a miracle is impossible . But that carries us out of the line of historical investigation altogether . That is a question of metaphysics . M. IRenan 's decision of the question is not admitted by an means universally , not even frequently . The truer decision as well as the more philosophical is that , prima fucie , all things are possil*le , except contradictions . At all events , we hold that the Four Evangelists stand on their own merits . They are not to be declared impostors , either in whole or in part , beforehand , in order to save a metaphysical theory . The same logical viciousness shows itself in M. IRenan 's treatment of the Prophets . Daniel never could have written the book attributed to him , he says , because that book contains statements of fact which occurred long after Daniel ! That is to say , NI . Renan does not believe in such a thing as prophecy , and , by consequence , Daniel never wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granted with a witness . And , by the way , we may as well ease our minds just here concerning another trick of the school to which N. Renan belongs , and of which he furnishes many marked examples . We mean the trick of arbitrarily deciding by what they are pleased to call philological criticism , ' all about all the books and nearly all the chapters in the Bible . Learned men are agreed that such and such chapters were not written by Isaiah . ' It is clear , from internal evidence of style , that this book was made up of earlier scattered memoranda . ' These chapters , it is evident , were not written till such and such a time . ' The best critics are agreed that this narration was added long after the writing of the book . ' This is the way they write , to the astonishment of the simple . When we were younger , this sort of talk seemed to our simplicity to be exceedingly imposing . We actually believed that there were a set of people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hebrew chapter and tell you who wrote it , when he wrote it , how he wrote it , and why ; and the who , when , how , and why , should be each different from those mentioned by the author of the book himself . As years removed the credulous simplicity of childhood , we found out that this was only a trick of the trade . We discovered that no two of these doctors agreed among themselves , that the line of argument they followed would disprove the authorship of any page ever written , that decisions from difference of style , wise as they might be , philologically , were , rationally and logically , nonsensical ; for Burns , no doubt , wrote his letters as well as his poems , and Shakspeare 's Sonnets ' were written by the hand that wrote King Lear , ' although , according to these wise doctors , it is assumed to be utterly impossible that the same man can use two styles , or that a man at seventy will write otherwise than he did at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more arbitrary , more opinionated , and more nuphilosophical than this philological criticism . ' Applied , as these wonderful German doctors apply it , to any book ever penned , and it can be shown , as the result of high critical ability , ' that no author ever wrote his own book . It is the easiest thing in the world to prove that Shakspeare never wrote Shakspeare , ' that Milton never wrote Paradise Lost , ' that Johnson 's Dictionary ' just growed ' like Topsey , and was never made at all , and , to name small things with great , that N. IRenan never wrote the Life of Jesus. * When we read , then , that it is certain that Isaiah never wrote this chapter , ' that St. John could not possibly have written the fourth Gospel , ' that this book is composed , undoubtedly , of fragments of earlier writings , ' or that 4313 // this ' other is the growth of a certain school , ' we advise simple Christians to take it easy . They are to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that their family Bibles still contain the old Table of Contents . There has been no wonderful discovery made , no ancient book catalogues have come to light , no files of ancient documents have been dug up . There are still just the old facts and the old evidence on which Christians made up their minds sixteen or seventeen hundred years ago . The amount of all this talk is only that the great Doctor Teufelsdroeck ' or the learned Professor Von Baum ' has hazarded a guess , and made an assertion , which every other great doctor ' and learned professor ' will contradict , and displace with another guess just as probable , in three months ' time . There are men just as learned and just as honest who have examined their guesses , and find them poor inventions indeed . And we have a right to deny point blank the assertions so flippantly made by men like M. Renan . It is universally aclcnowled*ied that this book was never written by Daniel or Isaiah or Jeremiah , ' It is certain this chapter is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc . It is not universally acknowledged . It is not certain . The whole thing is pure guesswork . There is only one way to prove the authorship of a book , and that is ly testimony . There is nothing under the sun more absurd , philologically , than that a common and very poor stock-actor should have written Hamlet . ' We know he did write it , however , not by internal evidence , ' or from philological criticism , ' but by plain human testimony to the fact . We cite that , and leave the internal ' critics to their profound babble on vowels and consonants , on long and short syllables , and let them do with the fact the best they can . In other words , there is no way by which I can determine whether St. John wrote his Gospel except by testimony . I do not know beforehand how St. John would write . I can therefore judge nothing by style . ' All I can do is to ask of competent witnesses . I do ask . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , that he did write this Gospel , that this is the very one which we now have , for they cite it and mention its peculiarities . I accept the fact , as I do in the case of Shakspeare , and let the wise critics* settle it among them . The attempt , therefore , on the part of N. Renan , to get rid of those large portions of the Gospels which embarrass him in his theory , by attempting to discredit their authorship , while , at the same time , he accepts other parts , that stand on the same authority , and the supercilious wayin which he ignores that large part which the miracles fill , turning them off with a small witticism , or a smaller bit of sentiment , suggest , at the start , decided suspiciens of the honesty of his intentions and the sufficiency of his theory . We only hint at these things here . They occur all through his book . They are not evidence of learning or critical skill . There are no secrets for deciding such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the members of the Institute ' together do not possess one grain of evidence that any ordinary scholar in America does not possess as well . M. Renan rejects , or discredits , or garbles , or slips over silently , because he finds it necessary for his theory . That is all . He pettifogs with his witnesses to establish his theory . That theory is , that He , whom all Christians have called Our Lord , was a mere man , of what race is uncertain , born in Galilee of a man name Joseph and of a woman named Mary ; who taught in Galilee and a little in Judea , and who was at last killed and buried , and so an end of Him . This theory N. Renan has to find in the Gospels , and there is , as we have hinted , very little of the Gospels left when he gets through . It is so palpably against // them that he has to get rid of the most of them to make it stand . Now this theory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Will it explain the facts ? We have seen how it is compelled to get rid of the Gospels . But we put that aside . Will it explain the history of Christianity ? Will it explain its place to-day ? Will it account for its effects ? The Jesus of M. Renan is a strange character . He is more difficult of comprehension than any mystery of orthodoxy . We ask where He gets His wondrous wisdom , this young carpenter , how He learned to speak as man never spoke ? ' and M. Renan sentimentalizes . We ask how He got this wondrous power over men , to lead them and control them , so that they followed Him and heard Him gladly , ' and M. Renan goes off into ecstasies over the delicious climate ' and the lovely villages , ' and the Arcadian simplicity of Galilee , as he fancies they once were , and expects us to be answered . His influence over women is accounted for more readily . M. Renan tells us , in his peculiar way , that this beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ susceptibilities of Mary Magdalene ; and Pilate 's wife , having once seen him , dreamed about him ' the next night , and sent to her husband to save him in consequence ! However , He begins His teaching . Where He learned it , how He learned it , why it took the form it did , how He came to give moral law to the world , where He found the words of wisdom and consolation  --  the divine words of power-for all generations , there is positively not one sentence of explanation . Of all the young Jews of His day , how came He by these powers and this omnipotent wisdom ? Now the Christian theory does attempt an explanation . It gives an ample answer to the question . M. Renan gives no answer whatever . He flies to sentiment . We have all sorts of adjectives- ' delicious , ' enchanting , ' ' beautiful , sweet , ' charming - he beats a whole female seminary at the business , in attempting to describe how , like full-grown babes , everybody in Galilee lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all  --  and that is all ! What shall a man do , whom this fine style of novel writing does n't answer  --  to whom , in fact , it seems just a bit of disgusting nonsense ? Is this wonderful power , this omnipotent wisdom , a production of the delicious ' climate ? Is. this all philosophical criticism ' has to offer , and is he to accept that as more reasonable than the Gospel theory that they were supernatural and divine ? In this wonderful romantic dialect , M. Renan describes the beginning of our Lord 's ministry . He is embarrassed , however , by the fact that , as Jesus goes on , He Himself makes clain*s , and sets up pretensions , and exercises powers , which are totally at variance with the proposed explanation . M. Renan can not deny that He claimed to be the Son of God , the Messiah , the Son of David , that He claimed to work miracles , ' to possess supernatural powers , to be somewhat altogether different from the amiable , sentimental , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be got on with ? Why , by declaring boldly that Jesus was half deceiver and half deceived ! by accepting the difficulty , and confessing that He cheated men for their goodthat , as they wished to be deceived , He stooped to deceive them , and at last half deceived Himself ! We know nothing more thoroughly immoral than is M. Renan on this matter . This Jesus of his , about whom he sentimentalizes , whom he declares a thousand times to be so charming , ' and so divine , ' and the rest , tvrns out to be a deliberate cheat and quack , putting out claims He does not Himself believe , and acting in sham miracles which people coax Him , according to his biographer , to perform . The raising of Lazarus , for instance , which M. Renan would like to turn // out of the Gospels , but which he is forced to confess must stay-according to him , was a deliberate , planned , stage performance , a gross piece of juggling imposition . Now we do not object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He has a perfect freedom of choice . Wc do object to the immorality , the essential blindness to right and wrong , which lead him to apologize for the cheat , and try to prove it a perfectly innocent and justifiable thing . We protest against confounding eternal distinctions , against debauching conscience by proving wrong right , and a cheat an innocent bit of acting , against claiming an impostor and a liar as the high priest of the world 's absolute religion ' ! But few of us , in this part of the world , can appreciate the transcendental reasoning that makes an impostor half divine , or a cheat holy . Good faith and imposture , ' to quote our author , are words which , in our rigid conscience , are opposed like two irreconcilable terms , ' though , he says , it is not so in the Enst , ' from which our religion came , and was certainly far from being so with our Teacher ! We can not admire N. Renan here . The writing is very fine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all right , and show us that we have profound reason to admire this lying teacher , this cheating miracle monger , whom he holds up between us and the pure Son of Mary . ' But it does not answer . In this cold climate a lie is a lie a cheat is a cheat , and a mountebank and impostor is not the teacher of the absolute religion of humanity ! ' As N. iRenan writes His life , that is the way in which the Founder of Christianity . develops Himself . First we have the young man , amiable , sweet , charming , ' enacting a beautiful pastoral'in the delicious climate of Galilee , ' where it appears that nobody has anything to do save to enact pastorals , ' although we are told brigandage was common in Galilee , ' which seems a strange accompaniment to pastorals . ' Where lie got His wisdom , how He came by these transcendent utterances , ' which , we are told , some few ' only , even now , are lofty enough to appreciate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , right in the midst of them , this wonderful young man , uttering these charming ' lessons , and these delicious ' sayings , sets to work miracle-mongering , trying His hand at thaumaturgy and legerdemain , becomes an impostor and a mountebank , pretending , among other things , to raise a man who puts on a shroud , gets into a grave , and shams dead ! At last He is taken , and then , in view of death , becomes penitent , reforms , and recovers His purity ! Now Thomas Paine was , in a way , an honest man . We can say that of him . Voltaire was , in his degree , honest too . Having said what N. iRenan says , they did not stultify themselves logically . They honestly pronounced Christianity a delusion . We have respect for their consistency . But our modern man says that a cheat in religion is no cheat , a lie no lie , that a true saving faith can be built on a foundation of deception and trickery ! He says it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentimentality ! N. Renanhere is just disgusting . There are a few things in this world that do not mix . Right and wrong have something of a ditch between them . A lie is not own brother to the truth . If he thinks it worth while to write the life of an impostor , very well ; only , when he has declared him so , and insisted on his being so , we humbly beg he will not turn round and insist on it that the religion he taught is divine ! If the credulity of believers is great , what shall we say of the credulity of Messieurs the philosophers , the unbelievers ? But what shall we say of their morality ? But if this new theory fails to account for Christianity as a true system of religion , what shall we say of its // coherence with Christianity as a 8ueeessful system in action This sentimental impostor conquers the civilized world . This charming ' worker of sham wonders becomes a GoD to the millions who to-day lead mankind ! Here is where M. Renan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only utterly illogical and incoherent , but where it becomes too gross for any mortal credulity , and too blasphemously wicked for any ordinary sinfulness . It is utterly incoherent , for it requires us to believe that a system , begun in fraud and deception , has proved itself the truest and most beneficent and sacred treasure to the world . N. Renan insists on both . From such a premise he drags such a conclusion . Is there any plain Christian who dreads a sneer at Christian credulity ? Let him be comforted . What credulity is like this ? What miracle in the Four Gospels ' begins to be wonderful compared with this miracle of the modern thaumaturge ? The religion which has taught men truth-above all things , truth-which teaches utter horror of a lie , which insists on the bare , bald reality in heaven and earth , which has taught men hatred of the false as the meanest and most unmanly thing existing-this religion took its rise in claptrap miracles , was puffed into popularity by boasting pretensions , was born in trickery and nurtured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the offspring of clumsy jugglery and cheap prestidigitation ! But more : this religion , so born and nurtured , becomes the mistress of the earth . It is of no consequence that only a minority of men accept it . That minority hold the world in their hands . In fact , it seems from history , that any number of men , with this religion in their hearts , become half omnipotent - that twelve can take it and master humanity by its power . To-day the men who profess it can do what they will on the face of this planet . It has so seized temporal power , so moulded blind force , so mastered strength-it has so conferred wisdom and valor and might on men , that those who have accepted it have been crowned above their kind , that they go everywhere as the acknowledged leaders and lords of the race , the vanguard of humanity . And a deception has brought all this to pass , a delusion has produced these stern realities ! Here 's where the wickedness stands out nakedly ! Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful lord ? Is the lying devil , after all , supreme ? Is a lie as good as the truth ? Why , the very earth reels beneath us ! Is there any God at all ? Are truth and good and God mere dreams , that a cunning fraud like this can so prosper and prevail under the white heavens ! N. IRenan 's Life of Jesus ' offers me that as a most reasonable theory ! Believing in a true God and a good God , being utterly incapable of believing in the lying devil it proposes to me , this pleasant theory , that , beneath the face and eyes of that true God , a poor imposture , a cheap delusion becomes , not only the holiest thing , the purest thing , the most sanctifying thing , but also the strongest thing , the most victorious thing in all the world ! If ever theory so played slight of hand with cause and effect , if it ever so mingled and mixed right and wrong , and so taught that lies and truth were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if ever any theory required power of gullibility like this last and newest , we have failed to hear of that . The fact is there is no escaping the honest conclusion that , unless Jxsus CHRIST is what He claimed to be , divine , GOD manifest in the flesh , ' the Son of the Father , ' then I-Ic was simply an impostor . ( He could not have been a self-deceived fanatic . ) Now any man is free to accept the last horn of this dilemma , if he chooses . It is a free country . But if he takes that , we insist that lie is logically bound to // call Christianity a cheat , a delusion , a snare and a curse to humanity ! He shall not ask us to swallow the monstrous and immoral proposition , that this outrageous lie and imposture is the glory , the blessing and hope of humanity ! And this is what M. Ernest Renan , in most melodious sentences , proposes . This is his theory of Christianity , its origin and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelief has to offer , the most rational account it has to give in the year 1864 . Surely unbelief must have large faith in human nature 's capacity of spiritual swallow , if men are expected to take this down , as more reasonable than what they will hear in the next pulpit Nay , after all , the Christian theory of Christianity is the most rational yet . It has mysteries , but it calls them mysteries , things above reason . It accepts them , and so escapes absurdity-ends with no means , effects from no causes , wonders that spring out of the ground , divine teachers produced by a charming ' climate , and impostures that are holy truths ! Above all , it escapes moral idiocy , and holds there is a line l ) etween right and wrong ! On the whole , it is , as yet , the only theory which explains all the facts , the only one of which the consequences may be logically accepted , which makes Christ or His religion reasonable or possible . N. Renan 's beautiful* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , conducting grand picnics in that charming ' climate , and making life a May day , is not the world 's mighty Deliverer ; and his miracle-mongering demagogue , claiming to be the Son of David in lying genealogies , and the Son of God in blasphemous audacity , is not the world 's Teacher of all Truth and Righteousness . The new Jesus is a poor substitute for the Divine Man whom we adore . We can not , therefore , accept the new theory . It is not logically competent to the facts . Established on garbled evidence with painful struggles , it will not , when cempleted , fulfil the conditions . It is not reasonable . It is not moral . We have desired to present this view of it . The details of criticism we leave to others , who can easily deal with N. Renan . We have aimed to show , what any plain reader can see , the unreasonableness and immorality of this theory of Chistianity 's origin . As long as we have faith in a righteous God , so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and holiest religion is born in fraud and trickery . N. Renan 's theory declares the purity and the holiness of Christianity , and yet insists on the trickery and the fraud : therefore we must reject his theory . So long as we believe that a true God is omnipotent , we can not believe that fraud and deception are masters of the world . But N. Renan insists that Christianity has mastered the world , and yet declares it founded upon fraud and deception . We must therefore reject M. Renan . The fine writing , the sentiment , the abundant sweetness ' of the book can not make beautiful this monstrous perversion of reason , this insidious attack on the very distinction between God and Satan . Voltaire 's theory is comparatively honest , healthy , moral . Paine 's is so . These men called things by their right names . They never undertook to upset the human conscience . Ernest Renan 's theory is thoroughly immoral , and he only can accept it who denies that the world is governed by moral laws at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . God never created such a creature . He exists nowhere save in M. Renan 's pages . In this blind , reeling world , in this weary , painful time , while the sobs of a dumb creation break along the shores of heaven in prayer , we can not spare the real Jesus , the world 's strong De // liverer , its conquering Lord ! The vision He exhibited , of a stainless humanity , omnipotent in purity , loyalty , and truth , has flashed and flamed before the eyes of men , through the long night of the ages , their beacon fire of hope , their star of faith ! We can not spare Him now . In Him all is consistent , all is reasonable , all is harmonious . The Divine Man accounts for His wisdom , vindicates the origin of His power . In the vision of His face , Christianity and all its results are the natural works of His hand . We turn to His Life . We leave M. Renan 's little novel , and turn to the Godlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Man , who redeemed humanity , and bought the world , and conquered hell and death : we turn to thatlife , that death , that awful resurrection , and take heart and hope . No mere amiable , sentimental , beautiful , ' or charming ' young man will do . The world cries for its Lord ! The race He ransomed looks to the Lion of Judah , ' the Captain of the Lord 's Host . ' The mad , half-despairing struggle we have waged all these long centuries , can find only in the Son of Man , ' in the omnipotent Son of God , ' its explanation and its end : God was manifest in the Flesh , reconciling the World unto Himself !
