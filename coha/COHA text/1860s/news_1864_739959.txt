txt Bunkum Speeches . Mr. VAN WINKLE , of Western Virginia , on Thursday , in the Senate , when the bill for the repeal of the Fugitive Slave law came ' up for consideration , opened the debate by saying that , " The remarks he would make , though not particularly applicable to the bill under consideration , would not be inappropriate . " He then proceeded to make a speech , in which he discussed the loyalty of the Border States ; the absurdity of the Copperheads ; the constitutionality of the admission of Western Virginia to the Union , and the circumstances attending that event ; the extent to which the new State had contributed men to the army ; the consequences that would have followed her failure or refusal to do so ; and it was only at the close of his long speech , if we are to judge from the summary , that he found time and opportunity to say a few words upon the subject before the Senate . That " these remarks were not particularly applicable to the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no great moment , as Mr. VAN WINKLE seems to think , did , in fact , render them peculiarly inappropriate ; and the erroneous notions of the nature and objects of parliamentary discussion , which he seems to entertain , are so widespread , and are just now doing so much mischief , that we seize this opportunity of protesting against them . Congress is not a debating club , in which discussions are carried on for the sake of discussion . It is an assembly for the prosecution of serious and important business  --  just now the most serious and important that was ever laid before any deliberative body . There are a great number of questions before it , all of them of the highest moment , and each of them , every time it comes up , demands the serious and undivided attention of every member present . This can not be given , and will not be given , as long as anybody who has possession of the floor is permitted to make long , rambling speeches upon everything that comes into his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste of time which this practice causes , the restless , scatter-brained , indolent style of thinking which it inevitably produces , the extent to which it protracts the debates on every measure , are just now evils of the first magnitude , and something ought to be done to put an end to them . The practice itself is a legacy bequeathed to us by the old times  --  for they are now old times  --  before the war , when the one subject ? pf discussion was Slavery  --  and when everybody knew so well what everybody else would say about it , that it made little difference what he said , particularly as Congress had little else to do than to listen to him . As there was plenty time , and no other means of keeping himself before the public , every member felt it his duty to give , at least once in every session , a full history of the Slavery controversy from the foundation of the Government down to the Year 1850 ; then to castigate his opponents severely , and finally to expose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with some caustic remarks upon the trouble and dismay that would be caused amongst the European aristocracies , by the prospective growth of the Republic . We need not tell any ' of our readers how much change there has been since then . If not a word were uttered in Congress for the next four months , except upon the bills now before it , and if every member was in his place every time , they were brought up , and gave each of them , as it came before him , his sole and undivided attention , the larger number of them would still be very unsatisfactorily framed , very imperfectly debated and very improperly understood . We can not impress too strongly upon the members of both branches the fact , that a large proportion of them are very ill-qualified for their work , have a very limited acquaintance with many of the subjects with which they have to deal and that they have consequently not a minute to spare from their study of them . The wickedness and causelessness of the rebellion ; the goodness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JEFF . Devis and his confederates ; the powers and resources of the North ; and the rascality of England and France , are now the favorite themes of Congressional spouters . No matter what is before either House , few members feel easy till they have delivered themselves of a large quantity of " perilous stuff " on these points . We respectfully suggest , that we have now had enough of it from that quarter , and that declamation on these tempting topics had better , in future , be left to the newspapers , and that the National Legislature occupy itself solely and exclusively with such bills as the payment of the national debt , the subjugation of the South , the maintenance of a large army and navy , and the care of the emancipated blacks . We promise faithfully to find other very enticing subjects for " orations " when these matters have been satisfactorily settled , but we confess we do not believe our ingenuity will be tested for a long time to come .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
