Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : PYTHAGORAS. from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) Above the petty passions of the crowd I stand in frozen marble like a god , Inviolate , and ancient as the moon . The thing I am , and not the thing Man is , Fills these deep sockets . Let him moan and die ; For he is dust that shall be laid again : I know my own creation was divine . Strewn on the breezy continents I see The veind shells and burnished scales which once Enwrapped my being  --  husks that had their use ; I brood on all the shapes I must attain Before I reach the Perfect , which is God , And dream my dream , and let the rabble go : For I am of the mountains and the sea , The deserts , and the caverns in the earth , The catacombs and fragments of old worlds . I was a spirit on the mountain-tops , A perfume in the valleys , a simoom On arid deserts , a nomadic wind Roaming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romulus and Remus were ; I was ere Nineveh and Babylon ; I was , and am , and evermore shall be , Progressing , never reaching to the end . A hundred years I trembled in the grass , The delicate trefoil that muffled warm A slope on Ida ; for a hundred years Moved in the purple gyre of those dark flowers The Grecian women strew upon the dead . Under the earth , in fragrant glooms , I dwelt ; Then in the veins and sinews of a pine On a lone isle , where , from the Cyclades , A mighty wind , like a leviathan , Ploughed through the brine , and from those solitudes Sent Silence , frightened . To and fro I swayed , Drawing the sunshine from the stooping clouds . Suns came and went , and many a mystic moon , Orbing and waning , and fierce meteors , Leaving their lurid ghosts to haunt the night . I heard loud voices by the sounding shore , The stormy sea-gods , and from fluted conchs Wild music , and strange shadows floated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years Clustered about me , till the hand of God Let down the lightning from a sultry sky , Splintered the pine and split the iron rock ; And from my odorous prison-house a bird , I in its bosom , darted : so we fled , Turning the brittle edge of one high wave , Island and tree and sea-gods left behind ! Free as the air , from zone to zone I flew , Far from the tumult to the quiet gates Of day-break ; and beneath me I beheld Vineyards , and rivers that like silver threads Ran through the green and gold of pasture-lands , And here and there a hamlet , a white rose , And here and there a city , whose slim spires And palace-roofs and swollen domes uprose Like scintillant stalagmites in the sun ; I saw huge navies battling with a storm By ragged reefs along the desolate coasts , And lazy merchantmen , that crawled , like flies , Over the blue enamel of the sea To India or the icy Labradors . A century was as a single day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , no more . And yet I hold one hour Beyond all price  --  that hour when from the sky I circled near and nearer to the earth , Nearer and nearer , till I brushed my wings Against the pointed chestnuts , where a stream That foamed and chattered over pebbly shoals , Fled through the briony , and with a shout Leaped headlong down a precipice ; and there , Gathering wild-flowers in the cool ravine , Wandered a woman more divinely shaped Than any of the creatures of the air , Or river-goddesses , or restless shades Of noble matrons marvellous in their time For beauty and great suffering ; and I sung , I charmed her thought , I gave her dreams , and then Down from the sunny atmosphere I stole And nestled in her bosom . There I slept From moon to moon , while in her eyes a thought Grew sweet and sweeter , deepening like the dawn  --  A mystical forewarning ! When the stream , Breaking through leafless brambles and dead leaves , Piped shriller treble , and from chestnut boughs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a quick , low cry , as infants do : We weep when we are born , not when we die ! So was it destined ; and thus came I here , To suffer bravely as becomes my state , One step , one grade , one cycle nearer God . And knowing these things , can I stoop to fret , And lie , and haggle in the market-place , Give dross for dross , or everything for naught ? No ! let me sit above the crowd , and sing , Waiting with hope for that miraculous change Which seems like sleep ; and though I waiting starve , I can not kiss the idols that are set By every gate , in every street and park ; I can not fawn , I can not soil my soul : For I am of the mountains and the sea , The deserts and the caverns in the earth , The catacombs and fragments of old worlds . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE TRAGEDY . LA DAME AUX CAMELIAS. from Pampinea and other poems ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that was the play ; The house was packed from pit to dome With the gallant and the gay , Who had come to see the Tragedy , And while the hours away ! There was the faint Exquisite , With gloves and glass sublime ; There was the grave Historian , And there the man of Rhyme , And the surly Critic , front to front , To see the play of Crime . And there was heavy Ignorance , And Vice in Honiton lace ; Sir Croesus and Sir Pandarus  --  And the music played apace . But of all that crowd I only saw A single , single face ! ' T was that of a girl whom I had known In the summers long ago , When her breath was like the new-mown hay , Or the sweetest flowers that grow  --  When her heart was light , and her soul was white As the winter 's driven snow . ' T was in our own New England She breathed the morning air ; ' T was the sunshine of New England That blended with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere ! All day like a ray of light she played About old Harvey 's mill ; And her grandsire held her on his knee In the evenings long and still , And told her tales of Lexington , And the trench at Bunker 's Hill  --  And of the painted Wamponsags , The Indians who of yore Builded their wigwams out of bark In the woods of Sagamore ; And how the godly Puritans Burnt witches by the score ! Or , touching on his sailor-life , He told how , years ago , In the dark of a cruel winter night , In the rain and sleet and snow , The good bark Martha Jane went down On the rocks off Holmes ' Ho ' ! The years flew by , and the maiden grew Like a harebell in the glade ; The chestnut shadows crept in her eyes  --  Sweet eyes that were not afraid To look to heaven at morn or even , Or any time she prayed ! She walked with him to the village church , And his eyes would fill with pride To see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them side by side ! Sweet Heaven ! she were an angel now If she had only died . If she had only died ! Alas ! How keen must be the woe That makes it better one should lie Where the sunshine can not go , Than to live in this sunny world of ours . Where the happy blossoms blow ! Would she had wed some country clown Before the luckless day When her cousin came to that lowly home  --  Her cousin Richard May , With his city airs and handsome eyes , To lead her soul astray ! One night they left the cottage  --  One night in the mist and rain ; And the old man never saw his child Nor Richard May again ; Never saw his pet in the clover patch , In the meadow , nor the lane . Ah ! never was a heart so torn Since this wild world began , As day by day he looked for her , This pitiful old man . " Where 's my pretty maid ? " he said , This pitiful old man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away ; And we never heard of her who fled In the night with Richard May ; Never knew if she were alive or dead Till I met her at the play ! And there she sat with her great brown eyes , They wore a troubled look ; And I read the history of her life As it were an open book ; And saw her Soul , like a slimy thing In the bottom of a brook . There she sat in her rustling silk , With diamonds on her wrist , And on her brow a slender thread Of pearl and amethyst . " A cheat , a gilded grief ! " I said , And my eyes were filled with mist . I could not see the players play , I heard the music moan ; It moaned like a dismal autumn wind , That dies in the woods alone ; And when it stopped I heard it still , The mournful monotone ! What if the Count were true or false ? I did not care , not I ; What if Camille for Armand died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman opposite Who held me with her eye ! The great green curtain fell on all , On laugh , and wine , and woe , Just as death some day will fall ' Twixt us and life , I know ! The play was done , the bitter play , And the people turned to go . And did they see the Tragedy ? They saw the painted scene ; They saw Armand , the jealous fool , And the sick Parisian quean ; But they did not see the Tragedy  --  The one I saw , I mean ! They did not see that cold-cut face , Those braids of golden hair ; Or , seeing her jewels , only said , " The lady 's rich and fair . " But I tell you , ' t was the Play of Life , And that woman played Despair ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : TWO LEAVES FROM A PLAY . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) 1 .  --  Hortense . O , but she loved him , and the death she died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pined themselves into the grave . She was not fashioned of such gossamer ; For one bleak midnight , robed as for a fte , With all her splendor , and her jewels on , She sucked quick poison from a finger-ring , And so they found her , in the morning  --  dead . The pearls lay on her bosom like pale flowers When no wind stirs them ; with one waxen hand She held his crumpled letter : in the room Sat Silence and white Slumber ! So she died . 2.  --  After the Masquerade . We 've danced the night out , Madaline . Pleasure is sick , and Music 's self has grown As languid as a weary ballet-girl ! There 's not a dozen maskers in the hall . How like the pictures on a wizard 's glass The particolored pageant has swept by  --  Fools with their bells , and Monarchs with their crowns , Athenians , and bearded Mamalukes , Death-heads and Satyrs , and weird shadows born In the brains of crazy poets . Yet so real  --  Such bitter mimicry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in miniature : We each wear dresses that become us not , We each are maskers in a Carnival . The spangles and the tinsel of our lives , The soul in song , the jests above our wine , Are pleasant lies that tell not what we are . The Droll 's at best a melancholy man ; His wit is only honey in a skull ; And though he glitter like a prism i ' the light His colors can not hide the skeleton ! The Scholar is a cynic , and the Priest A solemn epicurean in a cowl ; Philanthropy is politic : the Slave Wears not such fetters as the Emperor . And so , my love , Life plays at harlequin , Smothers itself in ermine , or puts on The icy front of virtue for effect . A smile 's a mask to hide a broken heart : Fair words are masks , and all this blazoned world Against the frozen opal in your ring , There 's no such mask as woman 's tears may be ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems ( 1861 ) 1 . Ah ! fine it was that April time , when gentle winds were blowing , To hunt for pale arbutus-blooms that hide beneath the leaves , To hear the slanting rain come down , and see the clover growing , And watch the airy swallows as they darted round the eaves ! 2 . You wonder why I dream to-night of clover that was growing So many years ago , my wife , when we were in our prime ; For , hark ! the wind is in the flue , and Johnny says ' t is snowing , And through the storm the clanging bells ring in the Christmas time . 3 . I can not tell , but something sweet about my heart is clinging . A vision and a memory  --  ' t is little that I mind The weary wintry weather , for I hear the robins singing , And the petals of the apple-blooms are ruffled in the wind ! 4 . It was a sunny morn in May , and in the fragrant meadow I lay , and dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring : Would Kathie Morris love me ? then in sunshine and in shadow I built up lofty castles on a golden wedding-ring ! 5 . O , sweet it was to dream of her , the soldier 's only daughter , The pretty pious Puritan , that flirted so with Will ; The music of her winsome mouth was like the laughing water That broke in silvery syllables by Farmer Philip 's mill . 6 . And Will had gone away to sea ; he did not leave her grieving ; Her bonny heart was not for him , so reckless and so vain ; And Will turned out a buccaneer , and hanged was he for thieving And scuttling helpless ships that sailed across the Spanish Main . 7 . And I had come to grief for her , the scornful village beauty , For , oh ! she had a witty tongue could cut you like a knife ; She scorned me with her haughty eyes , and I , in bounden duty , Did love her  --  loved her more for that , and wearied of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dream of her , to think her wavy tresses Might rest some happy , happy day , like sunshine , on my cheek ; The idle winds that fanned my brow I dreamed were her caresses , And in the robin 's twitterings I heard my sweetheart speak . 9 . And as I lay and thought of her , her fairy face adorning With lover 's fancies , treasuring the slightest word she 'd said , ' T was Kathie broke upon me like a blushing summer morning , And a half-blown rosy clover reddened underneath her tread ! 10 . Then I looked up at Kathie , and her eyes were full of laughter : " O , Kathie , Kathie Morris , I am lying at your feet ; Bend above me , say you love me , that you 'll love me ever after , Or let me lie and die here , in the fragrant meadow-sweet ! " 11 . And then I turned my face away , and trembled at my daring , For wildly , wildly had I spoke , with flashing cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , all pallid and despairing , For fear she 'd take me at my word , and leave me there to die . 12 . The silken fringes of her eyes upon her cheeks were drooping , Her merciless white fingers tore a blushing bud apart ; Then , quick as lightning , Kathie came , and kneeling half and stooping , She hid her bonny , bonny face against my beating heart . 13 . O , nestle , nestle , nestle there ! the heart would give thee greeting ; Lie thou there , all trustfully , in trouble and in pain ; This breast shall shield thee from the storm , and bear its bitter beating , These arms shall hold thee tenderly in sunshine and in rain ! 14 . Old sexton ! set your chimes in tune , and let there be no snarling , Ring out a joyous wedding-hymn to all the listening air ; And , girls , strew roses as she comes , the scornful , brown-eyed darling  --  A princess , by the wavy gold and glistening of her hair ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bells ? O , no ; who set them ringing ? I think I hear our bridal-bells , and I with joy am blind ; I smell the clover in the fields , I hear the robins singing . And the petals of the apple-blooms are ruffled in the wind ! 16 . Ah ! Kathie , you 've been true to me in fair and cloudy weather ; Our Father has been good to us when we 've been sorely tried : I pray to God , when we must die , that we may die together , And slumber softly underneath the clover , side by side . Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : HASCHEESH. from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) 1 . Stricken with thought , I staggered through the night ; The heavens leaned down to me with splendid fires ; The seven Pleiads , changed to magic lyres , Made music as I went ; and to my sight A Palace shaped itself against the skies : Great sapphire-studded portals suddenly Opened upon vast Gothic galleries Of gold and ebony , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , Dim tropic gardens stretching far away ! 2 . Ah ! what a wonder seized upon my soul , When from that structure of the upper airs I saw unfold a flight of crystal stairs For my ascending . .... Then I heard the roll Of unseen oceans clashing at the Pole . ... A terror fell upon me .... a vague sense Of near calamity . O , lead me hence ! I shrieked , and lo ! from out a darkling hole That opened at my feet , crawled after me , Up the broad staircase , creatures of huge size , Fanged , warty monsters , with their lips and eyes Hung with slim leeches sucking hungrily.  --  Away , vile drug ! I will avoid thy spell , Honey of Paradise , black dew of Hell ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : SONG . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) 1 . The chestnuts shine through the cloven rind , And the woodland leaves are red , my dear ; The scarlet fuchsias burn in the wind  --  Funeral plumes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me so much woe , That if it were not for you , my dear , I should wish the fuchsias ' fire might glow For me as well as the Year ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : HAUNTED . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) A noisome mildewed vine Crawls to the rotting eaves ; The gate has dropt from the rusty hinge And the walks are strewn with leaves . Close by the shattered fence The red-clay road runs by To a haunted wood , where the hemlocks groan And the willows sob and sigh . Among the dank lush flowers The spiteful firefly glows , And a woman steals by the stagnant pond Wrapped in her burial-clothes . There 's a dark blue scar on her throat , And ever she makes a moan ; And the humid lizards shine in the grass , And the lichens weep on the stone , And the Moon shrinks in a cloud , And the traveller shakes with fear , And an Owl on the skirts of the wood Hoots , and says , Do you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs over all  --  The palsied elms , and the dismal road , And the broken garden-wall . O , go not there at night , For a curse is on the place ; Go not there , for fear you meet The Murdered face to face ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : SONG . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) 1 . Merry is the robin That pipes away his care , And merry is the mackerel That leaps a yard in air ! And merry is the butter-cup Beneath the April sky , And merry as the spring-time , Love , are you and I ! 2 . Now the robin 's chilly , And all his songs are done ; No more the spotted mackerel Leaps silvery in the sun . O , mournful is the scarlet leaf , And mournful is the sky  --  But merry as the spring-time , Love , are you and I ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : MIRIAM 'S WOE . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) Miriam at the planter 's door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered round The vale of Nacoochee . Sat with an anguish in her eyes , And forehead bended low  --  Sat like a statue carved in stone , All pallid with her woe ! By dark bayou and cypress-swamp , By rice-field and lagoon , Her soul went wandering to the land That scorches in the noon ! And on the lover of her youth She turned her patient eyes , And saw him sad , and faint , and sick Beneath those alien skies . She saw him pick the cotton-blooms And cut the sugar-cane  --  A ring of iron on his wrist , And round his heart a chain ! She saw him , when his work was done , Sit down in some lone place , To dream of her , and weep for her , His hands across his face ! She heard the dear old violin That he was wont to play At twilight , in their courting-time , When life was sweet as May ! Then suddenly a catbird called From out a neighboring tree , And Miriam 's soul came back again To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart She held the little child , Who stretched its fragile hand to feel Her bosom 's warmth , and smiled . But she  --  she did not own a touch Of that fond little hand  --  Great God ! that such a thing should be Within a Christian land ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE ROBIN . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) From out the blossomed cherry-tops Sing , blithsome Robin , chant and sing ; With chirp , and trill , and magic-stops Win thou the listening ear of Spring ! For while thou lingerest in delight , An idle poet , with thy rhyme , The summer hours will take their flight And leave thee in a barren clime . Not all the autumn 's brittle gold , Nor sun , nor moon , nor star shall bring The jocund spirit which of old Made it an easy joy to sing ! So said a poet  --  having lost The precious time when he was young  --  Now wandering by the wintry coast With empty heart and silent tongue . Aldrich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) 1859. 1 . In the old church-tower Hangs the bell ; And above it on the vane , In the sunshine and the rain , Cut in gold , Saint Peter stands , With the keys in his two hands , And all is well ! 2 . In the old church-tower Hangs the bell ; You can hear its great heart beat , Ah ! so loud , and wild , and sweet , As the parson says a prayer Over wedded lovers there , While all is well ! 3 . In the old church-tower Hangs the bell , Deep and solemn . Hark ! again , Ah ! what passion , and what pain ! With her hands upon her breast , Some poor Soul has gone to rest Where all is well ! 4 . In the old church-tower Hangs the bell  --  An old friend that seems to know All our joy and all our woe : It is glad when we are wed , It is sad when we are dead And all is well ! Aldrich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other poems ( 1861 ) Blow from the temples of the Sun , Thou heavy-scented wind ; O , blow across the spicy isles And strike the roses blind ! And kiss the eyes of my true-love , And tell me if she be Not lovelier than the Khaleef 's wife Beyond the Indian sea ! Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : LAMIA . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) " Go on your way , and let me pass . You stop a wild despair . I would that I were turned to brass Like that grim dragon there , " Which , couchant by the groined gate , In weather foul or fair , Looks down serenely desolate , And nothing does but stare ! " What care I for the burgeoned year , The sad leaf or the gay ? Let Launcelot and Guinevere Their falcons fly this day . " Twill be as royal sport , pardie , As falconers have tried At Astolat  --  but let me be ! I would that I had died . " I met a woman in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long bent silken lashes weighed Her ivory eyelids down . " I kissed her hand , I called her blest , I held her true and fair  --  She turned to shadow on my breast , And melted in the air !

" O , let the petted falcons fly Right merry in the sun ; But let me be ! for I shall die Before the year is done . " Aldrich , Thomas Bailey , 1836-1907 : THE MAN AND THE HOUR . from Pampinea and other poems ( 1861 ) As some rare jewel , sealed within a rock , Would ne'er have glittered in the sunny air , Had not the lightning or an earthquake 's shock Crumbled the ledge , and laid its splendor bare  --  So do fine souls lie darkling in the earth Until some mighty tumult heaves them forth . Men of this land and lovers of these States ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a will inviolate as fate 's , God-like and prudent , merciful and wise , Do battle in God 's name and set us right Ere on our glory ruin broods and night !

True to our Flag  --  by land and sea Long may it wave for you ! 2 . May never traitor 's touch pollute Those colors of the sky  --  We want them pure , to wrap about Our heroes when they die !
