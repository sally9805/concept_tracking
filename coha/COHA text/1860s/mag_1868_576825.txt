txt WHAT A NEWSPAPER SHOULD BE . IT *s a strange fact , notwithstanding the general circulation , the acknowledged power for good or for evil , and the importance as an organ of public opinion , of the newspaper press , that no work has been written aiming to state the theory of conducting a public journal , and the proper mode of putting the theory into practice . What is meant , is , that as yet there is no philosophy of journalism . Like every other mundane agency , it must have its laws . There are , unquestionably , certain laws of success and usefulness to which , conscio*isly or unconsciously , public journals must conform if they would become a real power in the community , or realize a profit on the capital invested in then . It is purposed in this article to endeavor not only to suggest , with all diffidence , the true theory of successful journalism , but to indicate , as far as the writer can , what must be the prominent features of the great newspaper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is necessary to make a discrimination with regard to the functions of a daily paper , which is very generally overlooked . A public journal has a two-fold aspect . It is at once a record of news and an organ of public opinion . In the minds of most persons it is , besides , an educator or creator of public opinion , which to the writer seems entirely foreign to the correct conception of the functions of a newspaper . It is a common occurrence in this country to raise money to start journals for the purpose of changing the current of public sentiment . The value of such papers may be questioned , because the true function of a journal is to represent rather than to create public opinion ; indeed , it is doubtful whether the latter can be accomplished save under peculiarly favorable conditions . It is the experience of nearly every person who has contributed to the establishment of an organ having this end in view , that every such journal has failed in the attempt . In proof of this statement a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention of the fact must suffice . A condensed sketch of the origin and growth of the modern newspaper will furnish , perhaps , the clearest conception of the various functions which it fulfils . At first the newspaper was ( in England ) an occasional publication , designed to supply the public with some of the // most important news of the time . Contemporaneously with this gazette , or post , were published pamphlets , or occasional periodicals , representing some phase of public opinion , which in this way found expression in print . In the course of time these two very different functions were blended in what was called the newspaper , or public journal . Later still , a third feature was added by the mercantile portion of the community , which , taking advantage of the circulation of the paper , paid for the privilege of occupying a space in its columns with advertisements of their wares . Thus we have the three features of the modern journal , to wit : 1 . Its connection with the business public in its advertising columns ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; 3. and lastly , and highest of all , in its editorial columns , its character as a representative of the various phases of public opinion . And here mention may be made of typography . Seemingly by common consent , the largest type is given to the expression of opinion ; next , in order of size , is that in which is set the news of the day , arranged in the order of its interest ; and lastly , the advertisements , which , as regards typogiaphical prominence , are , in every well-regulated newspaper , made subordinate to the news and editorials . It is not at all improbable but that , in time , there may be a division among journals corresponding to the three features just specified ; e. g. , some papers will be printed simply for advertisements , others for news and others still for representations of public opinion on current events . In fact , this process is now going on , as is seen by the establishment within the last twenty or twenty-five years of daily and weekly papers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are newspapers published to-day which are noted for the fulness , freshness , and variety of their news rather than for their value as exponents of public opinion . In England , again , where the population is denser and the number of educated men of leisure is greater than in the United voL. i. - 22 States , there is a class of papers such as the Saturday Review , i*pectator , Economist , Examiner , London Review , and others of like character , which do not profess to give any news , have very little to do with the business world , and attract attention solely by the vigor and ability of their editorials and criticisms . Similar papers , but less perfect , such as the Round Table and Nation , are to be found here , and their number is certain to increase with the growth of our population . But before such a division as has been indicated can take place among journals-if ever it does completely-it is clear that the paper which is conducted in accordance with the best theory as regards its business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its news departinent , and which exhibits in its editorial columns a proper conception of its function as a representative of public opinion-such an one will be the leading newspaper in the country . What should be , in the writer 's estimation , the prominent features of the newspaper that would aspire to the front rank of American journalism , are now to be designated . Beginning with the advertising department , the rule should be inflexible that it should be conducted on the principle of an absolute democracy . All advertisers should be treated exactly alike , whether millionaires or servant-girls , so far as typographical prominence is concerned . The one may take three lines , and the other as many columns ; but the former must have the same show , typographically , as the latter . Special attention is directed to this point , because is , norance of its importance is the sole obstacle to the success of some of our most prominent journals . The advantage of this rule was first discovered by the London Times . The readers of that great paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will notice that all its advertisements are printed in the same size of type , and that they are strictly subordinate to the news and editorial departments as regards typographical prominence . This rule , with the added // regulation that the advertisements must be changed with every issue , is one secret of the financial success of the leading newspapers in England , and of such of the American journals as conform thereto . Examine the point more close ly . The persons who wish their advertisements to appear in extra large type , and who desire them to remain unchanged for some time , are generally quack doctors , venders of patent medicines , railroad , insurance , and other companies ; if the publisher accedes to their demands , he loses the small advertisements , which are the life of the business department of a paper . The number of these latter is the true index of the vitality of a journal . Marria* es , deaths , employment sought and employment offered , houses for sale or to let and houses wanted , articles lost and articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for sale , furniture to be sold at auction , personals , am*d so on through the whole category of the wants of society-these are always to be found among the smaller advertisements , and give interest to the advertising columns ; these , moreover , are sure to be driven away from the newspaper which grants to the advertisements of the merchant , the doctor , the sewing-machine company or the insurance company a typographical prominence that overshadows them . So invariable is this rule , that a person who desires to ascertain which of all the papers in a city is the most prosperous , has but to select the one which co - tains the largest number of ' small advertisements : he will find , also , that in this paper all the advertisements are set in type of a uniform size . Guided by this rule , be will select , for example , the Herald , in New York , as surpassing its city competitors in circulation and amount of business ; the Ledger , in Philadelphia , the commercial , in Cincinnati ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle , it may be mentioned , is not an American discovery . It was at first copied from the London Times by the New York Her id , and , strange to say , notwithstanding the amazing business success of the latter paper , to this day all its metropolitan competitors violate this simple rule , and to their own detriment . It is not surprising , however , that a publisher yields to the temptation to take two , four , or five hundred dollars from a vender of some nostrum for giving his notice a typographical prominence above all the other advertisements , forgetting that the apparent gain at the time is really a loss of thousands of dollars in the course of a year . Next in order is the news department of a journal . And here the rule is very simple . All the news should be given regardless of parties or persons , and without the slightest tinge of personal or partisan bias . Readers of newspapers expect , and have a right to expect , to be honestly dealt with . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world for one day , and it is in the interest of public morality that the news should not be distorted . One of the most reprehensible features of partisan journalism in the United States is the almost universal disregard of this principle . Republican papers , if they do not actually distort , color their political news to suit personal or partisan prejudices ; and democratic papers are fully as guilty . Some one has said that it seems as if most American editors conducted their sheets on the theory that men are divided into three classes , to wit : first , and most numerous , fools ; second , and less numerous , partisans ; third , and least numerous , wise men ; whereas , just the reverse is the case . The best journals , as they are the most successful in the end , are those which have the highest estimation of the intelligence of their readers . These remarks may seem to be mere truisms . So they are . Yet the writer would urge them as strongly as he can because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as of miscellaneous events , which seems so obvious , is so very generally disregarded ; and it is right here that so many American journals fail . The unworthy appeals , the distortions and // 331 bare-faced lies , which fill the columns of our party papers during a presidential canvass are a disgrace to the moral sense of the community , and for which the only consolation is that the journals that offend to the greatest extent are the least esteemed and the least patronized . In the large cities , an enlightened public sentiment has compelled the leading papers to refrain from printing distorted news , so that now the reports of meetings and the st* tements of political opponents are , in the main , correctly stated . The New York Herald , it is but fair to say , was the first American newspaper to imitate the London Times in this particular . There is one feature of the news department of the journals of the day which has been overlooked or misunderstood even by the conductors of the press . It is popularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the use of the telegraph , *has added to the value of news . This is true , but not in the generally accepted sense . The telegraph has destroyed the monopolizing character of the most enterprising journals . To appreciate this , imagine every telegraph in the country to be swept away in a night . There would be at once an enormous demand for the New York papers . Now , the merchant in Cincinnati , Chica* o , St. Louis , New Orleans , or San Francisco , obtains in his local papers the quotations of the London , Liverpool , and New York markets quite as soon as the merchant in New York . If his local paper were dependent upon the New York journals for these reports , the competition of business would incite the merchant to procure a copy of a New York paper as early as possible , and thus secure the desired news in advance of its appearance in his local newspaper . But the telegraphic news agencies , such as the Associated Press in this country , and Renter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monopoly of news inhering in any single locality , and built up local papers all over the country , which , in their own sphere , are quite equal to the so-called metropolitan press . Any one who will examine a leading journal of Cincinnati , Chicago , St. Louis , or of several other cities that might be named , will find that it is not inferior , as regards news , to a New York paper . It has the same cable despatches , the same market reports , and almost as full details of current news from every quarter . In fact , the telegraph and the associated agencies for obtaining and distributing news are a check to individual enterprise . The result has been to create important centres of news all over the country , which , while it prevents one or two leading papers from having a monopoly of the news , is yet a positive r*dvantage to the reading community and to the press . This important consideration brings to view the direction in which American newspapers must hereafter work to add to their value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be-that the news in one journal is no longer the special mark of its superiority over another journal , publishers will be forced to depend upon other means than the mere collection of current items to increase the circulation of their papers . First , they will have to reflect the best public sentiment of the time ; but of this more hereafter . Secondly , they will have to employ a higher order of talent than they do to-day . Men or women who can write intelligently , forcibly , gracefully , and attractively , must be sought after , and , when found , their services secured almost without regard to cost . Third , the leading newspapers must be printed on larger sheets , and the number of their departments extended . It is only within the last twenty or twenty-five years that journals have printed marine news , market reports , and financial articles ; yet in these the entire business of the country is deeply interested , and upon them , in great measure , depends . And here reference should be made to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the English press , and which is entirely foreign to the genius of our institutions , viz. : its anonymous character . This feature is indis // pensable to that part of the paper in which the editor speaks not for huinself , but for the public , to wit : the editorial columns . The use of we instead of I simply means that the editor expresses not his own opinions alone , but those of the persons whom he represents , whether a political party or the entire community . If editors and persons otherwise interested in the public press would but reflect , they would perceive that the only defensible theory of anonymous journalism is its impersonality , whence arises its value as an expression of the general sense of the community . But in all the departments besides the editorial , the American press would gain by copying the personal character of the Paris press . In France , journalism is specially honored through its representatives . Editors in that country are looked up to as leader* of the literary and artistic taste of the community ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we elected to the Academy and are made members of the government . But they receive no such honors in this country , nor will they until the publisher of some great newspaper has the wit to discern the attractiveness which would be added to its columns by allowing writers to make names for themselves . In this connection it should be stated that there is one department of metropolitan , and , indeed , of American journalism , which has fallen into great disrepute , and that is its correspondence . Our newspapers being generally conducted for personal or party profit , and their correspondents and reporters having no chance to distinguish themselves , the department entrusted to them makes little or no impression upon the public mind . It contains , in most instances , only a rehash of the news previously announced by the telegraph , written unattractively , and garnished by such patent commonplaces as the theme in hand may suggest . In some instances circumstances have compelled newspapers to permit certain of their correspondents to append their names to their letters , and the result has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers alike if this system were more general . In order to fix the responsibility , during the war , for statements made in letters from the various Union armies , the War Department ordered the correspondents of the press to append their names in print to their published letters . One effect of this was to make some men almost eminent . Crounse and Swinton , of the New York Times , Smalley , of the Tribune , Colburn , Stillson , and Townsend , of the World , Shanks , of the Herald , " Carleton , " of the Boston Journal , " Mac , " of the Cincinnati Gommercial , " Agate , " of the Cincinnati Gazette , and several others , became well and honorably known throughout the country for the accuracy of their war records and their power of graphic description . It is easy to un ( lerstand how purely selfish considerations have led the conductors of our newspapers to withhold from the public the names of their contributors ; but the writer is convinced that the destruction of the monopoly of news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading journals to employ abler writers than they do now , and to set before them , in addition to the attraction of a good salary , the chance to make a reputation for themselves . The secret of Mr. Bonner 's success in publishing a weekly story-paper is very simple , and hi* plan easily could be copied by every one of the daily papers of New York . He engaged , without regard to cost , the most attractive writers in the story-telling field , and , by the munificent inducements that were offered , obtained as contributors nearly all the celebrities of the country . The result was an enormous circulation for the Ledger , and a handnome fortune for its owner . While urging that the editorial opinions of a journal should be anonymous , it should also be insisted that in the other departments an opportunity be given for the development of individual talent . The present system of journalism , in this respect , is dishonest . Most papers which use the editorial we , and claim to represent the thought of the time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of A , B , or C , who write for them , and who , if honest , would sign their names to their productions . The habit of the public to associate certain journals with particular individuals ( such as the Tri1*-une with Mr. Greeley , the Times with Mr. Raymond , or the Philadelphia Press with Mr. Forney ) plainly shows that it does not consider that such papers represent its opinions . In discussing the editorial functions of a great journal , the writer will probably be constrained to advance views for which the public is unprepared and which may be severely criticised . At the very start the averment is made that a public journal has no business to have views of its own . More than that , if it would attain to the highest position in journalism , it must not accept from any person or any party the views which it may advance . To go still farther , it should pay no heed to consistency . Never sho*ild it be influenced by the fear lest the views expressed in it to-day are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those of the week to come . To repeat , a journal has no business to have opinions of its own . Its editorial columns should present as faithful a record of public opinions as its news columns do of current events . The discovery of this theory was first made by the London Times . It was , in the belief of the writer , a discovery as important in journalism as the invention of the spinning-jenny in manufactures , or of the steam-engine in mechanics . As has been stated already , the value of the opinions expressed in a newspaper is in exact proportion to the number of persons whose views they represent . If it were possible for an inhabitant of another planet to visit London or New York for the purpose of learning what the people of Great Britin or the United States were thinking about , what were their views upon the social and political questions of the day , that journal which should most faithfully reflect the thought of the mass of the community would be to him the most valuable and the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 333 no delusion more prevalent among editors , as there is none more groundless , than that they form or lead public opinion . They can do neither . Public opinion is created or moulded by public events , by the action of visible forces , such as the fluctuations of commerce , the operations of armies , changes in population , the rise , progress , and decay of religious and industrial organizations , the play of human passions and prejudices , and the conflicts of races . It is sheer conceit on the part of any editor to suppose that his notions or his speculations are of the slightest possible importance except in so far as they represent the views of the community , or a portion of the communityq to which they are addressed . Let no one infer that , in advancing this proposition , the writer would debase the function of an editor . On the contrary , lie would elevate it to its highest point by separating it from all personal conceit and the advocacy of merely personal notions . The careful reader of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ espoused in turn almost every phase of British politics . It has been radical , tory , whig , and conservative ; it has been for the Church and against the Church , for war and for peace , without so much as thinkin* whether it was consistent or inconsistent . And the reason why the American press is compelled to quote so freely and so frequently from it , is because it represents the average public sentiment of the governing class of Great Britain . There is no journal in France which is its counterpart in this respect ; hence , in reprinting articles from the French papers , the American press is compelled to state the political status either of the authors or of the newspapers themselves . In this country the journal which has the clearest conception of this idea of the editorial functions is the New York Herald , and its very large circulation shows that its apparent fickleness must be controlled by some principle which is satisfactory to the general public . Yet it falls very far short of what a great organ of public // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral tone . It is never in earnest ; whereas the public , when its mind is excited by passion , or prejudice , or righteous indignation , is terribly in earnest . A very noticeable feature of all the manifestations of popular sentiment is , they are almost always incited by the better instincts of human nature , and that the object to which they tend is a disinterested o* e . Perhaps the conduct of an audience at a theatre , first instanced by Nacaulay , is a fair sample of the mode in which public sentiment expresses itself . Go to that theatre which*is patronized by the lowest of the population , and it will be found , in a representation on the stage of the contest between vice and virtue , the triuinph of virtue is always applauded by the bods of the gallery . The utterance of a patriotic sentiment , an appeal to the best feelings of humanity , the rescue of innocence from the grip of vice , are sure to evoke a round of applause from even the vilest audiences . And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marked . Men acting in masses lose the meaner and more selfish attributes which distinguish them as individuals , and are compelled to join in the cry for some public good , though it may be of no special benefit to them as individuals . It is just this innate moral sense which the New York Herald lacks . Its intolerable flippancy , its want of earnestness , and its frequent change of opinion merely to pander to the caprice of the hour , are what has brought it into deservedly bad repute . Yet , despite these drawbacks , and despite its lack ( as all must admit ) of a high order of talent , it has won and maintained the position of the first journal of the country , and will continue to hold it until some other journal equals it in enterprise and independence , and surpasses it in earnestness , ability , dignity , and moral purpose . It would be an easy matter for any one of the four leading morning papers of New York to attain to this position ; indeed , many years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of public opinion will be so pressing as to call one into existence . It is a curious fact , that , not fully reeognizin* the representative character of a public journal , the press sometimes has run counter to the whole current of public opinion . The history of the Know-Nothing party furnishes an apt illustration of this . This strange phenomenon in our political history became a power in our politics before the press so much as knew of its existence . It had elected its candidates for public offices and entered the field as a great national party , without a single organ among the journals of the day . So soon as it became recognized as a power , of course , an hundred newspapers were ready to espouse its cause ; and , in time , the New York Herald , true to its theory of journalism , advocated its principles and the election of its candidates . Singular to relate , from the moment that the press became interested in this party , the latter be*an to lose its power , and finally died through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of New York city furnishes numerous instances of the voting population holding to one opinion and the press to another . Ia the presidential campaign of 1856 , the Herald , Tribune , Times , Post , Commercial Advertiser , and , in fact , nearly every daily paper in the city of any account at all , strenuously advocated the election of Premont ; yet he received but 17,771 votes out of a total poll of 89,600 . Another remarkable instance was the election of Gunther to the mayoralty in 1863 . With the exception of the Journol of Commerce , he had not a solitary advocate among the daily papers ; yet , from causes inexplicable to the conductors of the other journals whose support was divided between Boole and Blunt , Gunther was elected . The frequent success of Fernando Wood in opposition to the united press shows how weak politically are the journals of New York city which fail to discern the drift of public opinion . And , in general , it will be found that in all great local nd n ' 4ional emergencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and without any reference to the general tone of the press ; the latter is of no value except in so far as it performs its functions as a representative of public opinion . Having laid down what the writer believes to be the true theory of successful journalism , it is in order to state more definitely what must be the prominent features of the journal which shall stand at the head of the press of the country . 1 . Editorially , as has been explained , it must represent public opinion , and that the highest and best . It must be purely representative in its character must be influenced by no individual or set of individuals for bis or their benefit , controlled by no party , and interested pecuniarily or otherwise in none of the great industrial enterprises of the day . 2 . The anonymous system in conespondence , important reports , literary and art articles , musical and dramatic criticisms , must be discarded , and the merits of the writers in these departments must be tested by individual standards . 3 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of a leading newspaper that of printing , as occasion may demand , summaries of current history . The loose , disjointed , and very unsatisfactory manner in which the telegraph furnishes the news from all parts of the world , renders almost valueless the accounts which are subsequently brought by the mails ; yet it is indispensable to a correct comprehension of current history and of the relations of events to each other , that from time to time there should be written , by competent persons , clear , succinct statements of important occurrences . This has been done in partial measure by some of our newspapers , but fitfully , without method , and in the usually careless manner . These historical summaries should be committed to graphic , forcible , and intelligent writers , and not to mere bald analysts . Current history should be as vivid as it is fresh . In this department , statistics should occupy an important place . The value of statistics is beginning to be understood , and there is probably not a journal in the country but feels the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar a subject as election returns . Yet this department of journalism is not conducted with any thing like the efficiency that it should be , or that it is destined to be at no distant day . 4 . The number of the departments of the great journal yet to be published must be increased and their scope enlarged . The money article , the marine ne s and the market reports , are very modern features of American journalism , and are excellent so far as they go . To them must be added a department devoted to railroads . This interest , so vast , representing so much capital , and in which almost every individual is interested as a traveller , a forwarder , or a stockholder , now forms only a subordinate portion of the money article of leading journals . All the New York papers , moreover , are deficient in special trade reports . This should not be so . Even the Chicago papers excel them in this feature . Nothing could be fuller or more admirable than the grain , lumber , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , the business upon which the prosperity of New York is built is most inadequately represented in the New York journals , as is shown by the multiplication of papers devoted to certain specialties of business , such as the Financial Ghronicle , Insurance 3fonitor , Shoe and Leather Reporter , Shipping Gazette , and others devoted to the interests of mining , of real estate , of petroleum , of inventions , of telegraphy , and one to gaslight associations . For all of these there would be no field if ths daily papers had the capital or the enterprise to occupy the various fields themselves . 5 . A special feature of the leading journal should be a mining department , in which should be recorded the precise facts with regard to mines throughout the country ; but extreme care // should be taken to prevent this , as well as all the departments pertaining to material interests , from being used for the advantage of any person or persons whatsoever . Readers should be honestly dealt with , and statements should be made solely for the benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other interested parties . And here it may be noted that one of the most disgraceful features of New York journalism is the suspicious character of its financial articles . It is notorious that nearly all of them are written in the interest of the " bulls " or " bears " of Wail-street . The names can be given of at least half a dozen financial editors of leading journals who have retired or died rich upon salaries rangin* from $28 to 40 a-week . Not long since , the proprietors of an evening paper had a quarrel with its money-editor , and the fact was testified in court that he had made $40,000 in speculation , to do which . the former alleged that he had used the paper . * * * * Some day it will be necessary to give the history of this department of the New York press with names and figures . It may not be just , perhaps , to charge the proprietors themselves of the newspapers with using the money articles for unworthy ends , but they are responsible for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ department of the paper should contain nothing but statements of facts without any comments whatever . 6 . No paper can hope to take the lead of its contemporaries that does not refuse first , last , and always , to be under the slightest obligations to its advertising patrons . The rule should be inflexible that the newspaper has discharged all its obligations to the advertiser when it has printed his advertisement , and the latter owes nothing to the paper when he has paid for inserting the same . One of the most disreputable features of journals in this country is , that they are open to influence by pecuniary considerations . Hardly one can be named that is not moved by railroad or banking corporations , or industrial enterprises of various sorts , to promote the pecuniary gain of its owners or of their friends . Take the sewing-machine interest , for example . The various companies which are authorized to avail themselves of the Howe patent are large advertisers , and , when they combine ( as they always do ) to influence the patent officers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depend , no warning voice is raised by the press . If the newspapers were to deal honestly with the public , the sewing-machine business might be thrown open to general competition , and , as a consequence , a machine now sold for fifty-five dollars might be bought for fifteen or twenty dollars , thus enabling every poor woman to own one . The construction of great lines of railroads is another case to the point . 7 . A marked feature of the coming leading journal will be its complete abolition of the dead-head system . The evils resulting therefrom are patent , and can not well be over-estimated . They are of less magnitude than they were a few years since , but are still too great to be tolerated even for another day . No paper can hope to be independent o ion0 as it permits those connected with it to beg or accept the shibbtest favor from any railroad or steamboat company , or from any manager of amusements ; nor should the criticisms of a paper th t accepts any such favors be entitled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged that , so long as it is the custom for all the papers to accept passes , there can be no harm in it . Grant this , if need be ; yet the first paper that will refuse to accept any favors of the kind will be the one , and the only one , whose criticisms will be of authority with the reading public . 8 . The writing of paragraphs  --  a feature peculiar to American journalismmust be sedulously cultivated by the great newspaper of the future . Current news , except such as is of very great importance , must be given in brief , and the comments upon it must // be terse , pertinent , and comprehensive . The extension of the telegraph will compel editors to study conciseness . It will not be long before the telegraphic wires will connect every known portion of the globe , and will furnish the morning journals with the news of the previous day from every quarter of the world . To print this , the papers will be obliged to compress into small compass much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column and column-and-a-half editorials , like the anonymous feature , are of English origin , and foreign to the tastes of our people . American orators are verbose beyond all others but our writers for the press are compelled to study terseness and pungency in their editorial statements and comments . The feuilleton of the Paris press will never find a place in American journalism , since life in this country is so active , so intense , so exciting , that it needs not the stimulant *f fiction in a daily paper . Still , the crisp personalities , the vivacity , and the culture that characterize the Paris journals , deserve to be naturalized in the United States . 9 . A change in the form of our newspapers will crc long be rendered necessary . The present quarto-form is a great improvement upon the old " single sheet " which had grown so large as to be unwieldy ; but it is far from satisfactory . Sixteen-page papers , such as the Pall Hall Garette of London ( the only daily newspaper of its kind now published ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight pages are deemed by advertisers disadvantageous to their interests , and with reason ; but with the introduction of sixteen pages their complaints will be silenced . This matter of form and typographical appearance is of greater importance than is generally suspected . Good paper , clear type , tasteful head-lines , the maintenance of the proper relations between the departments , and typographical excellence , are as essential to the prosperity of a newspaper as appropriate apparel is to the appearance of a ball-room belIe . Our metropolitan journals must be larger and command higher prices than they now do . Because papers published in this country or in England for one cent or one penny have occasionally attained to a large circulation , it is popularly supposed that all journals would do better if they were to become cheaper . But the supposition is erroneous . The mass of American readers do not mind expense so long as they can obtain an article which they believe to be the best of its kind . This is shown by the fact that the most expensive hotels and restaurants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the most extensively patronized . The persons who pay twenty or twenty-five cents a-piece for their cigars zill not begrudge paying eight or ten cents for a newspaper that satisfies their wants . The very cheapness of American journals has impeded their highest success . It has forced publishers to depend for their gains too much upon advertisemeats and accounts for the small sheets , poor type , brittle and dingy paper , and , in too many cases , subserviency to advertising patrons . Strangely enough , most of the country papers would not live a day but for the job-printing offices which are generally connected with them . This latter evil , however , corrects itself in course of time ; for , as the population increases , the circulation of the really good journals is enlarged , and the publisher realizes that the demands of the readers are quite as important as those of the advertisers . But this evil might be met at the outset by affixing a price to papers sufficient to make a reasonable circulation remunerative . The Western newspapers , by charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco papers , by charging ten cents a copy , have wholly avoided this obstacle to success . By consequence , the latter are not only excellent newspapers , but are ahnost entirely independent of their advertisers . Their circulation is so profitable that their conductors can afford to devote all their energies to pleasing their readers . The time is not remote when type will be set by machinery . This will // be an immense saving of money to publishers . If they study their true interests , they will not avail themselves of this to sell their papers at a reduced price , but will use the money thus saved to add to their size and attractiveness . This paper is not presented as exhaustive of the subject to which it is devoted . It has touched upon only its salient points . The writer is conscious that much more might be said , perhaps of equal interest , did he feel at liberty to occupy more space in a single article . So varied are the phases of journalism , so numerous and so important are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well-nigh inexhaustible . The sole object of the writer , at the present time , has been to point out some of the more obvious evils connected with journalism in this country , and to suggest to editors a theory of their functions , which , once put into practice , will make the press what it should be  --  the true representative of the spiritual force of an enlightened public opinion . It is , furthermore , his hope , nay , his belief , that the day is not far distant when the American press will fully realize the high mission entrusted to its charge . In enterprise , versatility , and vivacity ; in the fulness and variety of its news ; and in its adaptability to the wants of such a busy , energetic , intelligent community as that to which it appeals , it surpasses the press of any other country . It is not , however , all that it should be , all that it might be , or all that it is destined to be .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
