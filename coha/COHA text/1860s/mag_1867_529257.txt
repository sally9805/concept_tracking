CINCINNATI . THE French possessors of the Western country used to call the Ohio the Beautiful River ; and they might well think it beautiful who came into it from the flat-shored , mountainous Mississippi , and found themselves winding about an*ong lofty , steep , and picturesque hills , covered with foliage , and fringed at the bottom with a strip of brilliant grass . But travellers from the Atlantic States , accustomed as they are to the clear , sparkling waters ind to the brimming fulness of such rivers as the James , the Delaware , and the Hudson , do not at once perceive the fitness of the old French name , La Belle Rivi ? re . The water of the Ohio is yellow , and there is usually a wide slope of yellow earth on each side of the stream , from which the water has receded , and over which it will flow again at the next " rise . " It is always rising or falling . As at the South the item of most interest in the newspapers is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gold , so in the West the special duty of the newsgatherer is to keep the public advised of the depth of the rivers . The Ohio , during the rainy seasons , is forty feet deeper than it is during the dry . Between the notch which marks the lowest point to which the river has ever fallen at Cincinnati and that which records the point of its highest rise , the distance is sixty-four feet . If our Eastern rivers were capable of such vacillation as this , our large cities would go under once or twice a year . In truth , those great and famous Western rivers are ditches dug by Nature as part of the drainage system of the continent , - mere means of carrying off the surplus water when it rains . At the East , the water plays a part in the life , in the pleasures , in the imagination and memories of the people . We go down to Coney Island of a hot afternoon ; we take a trip to Cape May ; we sail in Boston Harbor ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band ; we spend a day at the fishing banks ; we go up the Erie Railroad for a week 's troutfishing ; we own a share in a small schooner ; we have yacht clubs and boat races ; we build villas which command a water view . There is little of this in the Western country ; for the rivers are not very inviting , and the great lakes are dangerous . They tried yachting at Chicago a few years ago , but on the experimental trip a squall capsized the vessel , and the crew had the ignominy of spending several hours upon the keel , from which a passing craft rescued them . Then , as to excursions , there is upon the lakes the deadly peril of sea-sickness ; upon the rivers there is no great relief from the heat ; and upon neither are there convenient places to visit . All you can do is , to go a certain distance , turn round , and come back ; which is a flat , uncheering , pointless sort of thing . Upon the whole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoyment of the people who live near them . Ve noticed at the large town of Erie , some years ago , that not one house had been placed so as to afford its inmates a view of the lake , though the shores offered most convenient sites ; nor did the people ever come down to see the lake , apparently , as there was no path worn upon the grassy bluff overlooking it . The Ohio River has another inconvenience . The bottom-land , as it is called , between the water 's edge and the hills , is generally low and narrow . Nowhere is there room for a large city ; nor can the hills be dug away except by paring down a great part of Ohio and Kentucky . When the traveller has climbed to the top of those winding mountains , he has only reached the average summit of the country ; for 229 // it is not the banks of the river that are high , but the river itself which is low . It is an error to say that the Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around which this river winds and curls and bends and loops , are simply the hills of the country through which the river had to find its way . We were astonished , in getting to the top of Cincinnati , after a panting walk up a zigzag road , to discover that we had only mounted to the summit of one billow in an ocean of hills . There is always a reason why a city is just where it is . Nothing is more controlled by law than the planting , the growth , and the decline of cities . Even the particular site is not a thing of chance , as we can see in the sites of Paris , London , Constantinople , and every other great city of the world . A town exists by supplying to the country about it the commodities which the country can not procure for itseli* In the infancy of the Ohio settlements , when it was still to be determined which of them would take the lead , the commodity most in request and hardest to be obtained was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to supply this most universal object of desire . In December , 1788 , fifteen or twenty men floated down the Ohio among the masses of moving ice , and , landing upon the site of Cincinnati , built cabins , and marked out a town . Matthias Denman of New Jersey had bought eight hundred acres of land there , at fifteen-pence an acre , and this party of adventurers planted themselves upon it with his assistance and in his interest . Jerseymen and Pennsylvanians were finding their way down the Ohio , and founding settlements here and there , whenever a sufficient number of pioneers could be gathered to defend themselves against the Indians . President Washington sent a few companies of troops for their protection , and the great questkm was where those troops should be pasted . The major in command was at first disposed to establish them at North Bend ; but whWe he was selecting a place there for his fort , he fell in with a pair of brilliant black eyes , - the property of one of the settler 's wives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her husband deemed it best to remove his family to another settlement , and pitched upon Cincinnati . The major then begnn to doubt whether , after all , North Bend was the proper place for a military work , and deemed it best to examine Cincinnati first . He was delighted with Cincinnati . He removed the troops thither , built a fort , and thus rendered the neighborhood the safest spot below Pittsburg . This event was decisive : Cincinnati took the lead of the Ohio towns , and kept it . In all the history of Cincinnati , this is the only incident we have found that savors of the romantic . Those black eyes lured Major Doughty to the only site on the Ohio upon which one hundred thousand people could conveniently live without climbing a very steep and high hill . It is also about midway between the source of the river and its mouth ; the Ohio being nine hundred and fifty-nine miles long , and Cincinnati five hundred and one miles from the Mississippi . The city is nearly the centre of the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly where it should be , and exactly where the metropolis of the valley might have been even if Major Doughty had not been susceptible to the charms of lovely woman . It is superfluous to say that Cincinnati is situated on a " bend " of the Ohio , since the Ohio is nothing but bends , and anything that is situated upon it must be upon a bend . This river employs itself continually in writing the letter S upon the surface of the earth . At Cincinnati , the hills recede from the shore on each side of the river about a mile and a half , leaving space enough for a large town , but not for the great city of two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants to which it has grown . Cincinnati is an odd name for a town , whether we regard it as a genitive singular , or as a nominative plural . The story goes , that the first settlers // appointed a committee of one to name the place . The gentleman selected for this duty had been a schoolmaster , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning appertaining to his former vocation . He desired to express in the name of the future city the fact that it was situafed opposite the mouth of the Licking River . He was aware that vile was French for " city , " that os was Latin for " mouth " ; that an/i in composition could mean " opposite to " ; and that the first letter of Licking was L. By combining these various fragments of knowledge , he produced at length the word LOSANTrVILLE , which his comrades accepted as the name of their little cluster of log huts and by this name it appears on some of the earliest maps of the Ohio . But the glory of the schoolmaster was short-lived . When the village had attained the respectable age of fifteen months , General St. Clair visited it on a tour of inspection , and laughed the name to scorn . Having laid out a county of which this village was the only inhabited spot , he named the county Hamilton , and insisted upon calling the village Cincinnati , after the society of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that summer of 1790 Cincinnati consisted of forty log cabins , two small frame houses , and a fort garrisoned by  --  a company or two of troops . We sometimes speak of " the Westem cities , " as though the word " Westem " was sufficiently descriptive , and as thouo'h the cities west of the Alle , ghany l*ountains were all alike . This is far from being the case . Every city in the Western country , as well as ev ery State , county , and neighborhood , has a character of its own , derived chiefly from the people who settled it . Berlin is not more different from Vienna , Lyons is not more different from Marseilles , Birmingham is not more different from Liverpool , than Cincinnati is from Chicago or St. Louis ; and all these differences date back to the origin of those cities . The Ohio , formed by the junction of two Pennsylvania rivers , is the natural western outlet for the redundant population of Pennsylvania and New Jersey , and consequently the first twenty thousand inhabitants of Cincinnati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saving Protestants , with less knowledge and less public spirit than the people of New England . The Swedes , the Danes , the Germans , the Protestant irish , who poured into Pennsylvania and New Jersey in Franklin 's time , attracted by the perfect toleration established by William Penn , were excellent people ; but they had not the activity of mind nor the spiritual life of the English Puritans . Shrewd calculators and of indomitable industry , they were more able to accumulate property than disposed to risk it in bold , far-reaching enterprises , and took more pride in possessing than in displaying wealth ,  - -  in having a large barn than an attractive residence . They were more certain to build a church than a schoolhouse , and few of them wanted anything of the book-pedler except an almanac . The descendants of such men founded Cincinnati , and made it a thriving , bustling , dull , unintellectual place . Then came in a spice of Yankees to enliven the mass , to introduce some quickening heresies , to promote schools , to found libraries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That wondrous tide of Germans followed that has made in each of the cities of the West a populous German quarter , - a town within a town . Meanwhile , young men from the Southern States , in considerable numbers , settled in Cincinnati , between whom and the daughters of the rich " Hunkers " of the town marriages were frequent , and the families thus created were , from 1830 to i86i , the reigning power in the city . Perhaps there was no town of its size and wealth in Christendom which had less of the higher intellectual life and less of an enlightened public spirit than Cincinnati before the war . It had become exceedingly rich . Early in its career the great difficulty and expense of transporting goods across the moun // tains and down the winding Ohio had forced the people into manufacturing , and Cincinnati became the great workshop , as well as the exchange , of the vast and populous valley of the Ohio . Its wealth was legitimately earned . It was Cincinnati which originated and perfected the system which packs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pig into a barrel , and sends him over the mountains and over the ocean to feed mankind . Cincinnati imported or made nearly all that the people of three or four States could afford to buy , and received from them nearly all that they could spare in return , and made a profit on both transactions . This business , upon the whole , was done honestly and well . Immense fortunes were made . Nicho- ' las Longworth died worth twelve millions , and there are now in that young city sixty-four persons whose estate is rated at a million dollars or more . But , with all this wealth and this talent for business , the people of Cincinnati displayed little of that spirit of improvement which has converted Chicago , in thirty years , from a quagmire into a beautiful city , and made it accessible to all the people of the prairies . There was too much ballast , as it were , for so little sail . People were intent on their own affairs , and were satisfied if their own business prospered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rare , and a well-sustained course of lectures was felt to be out of the question . Books of the higher kind were in little demand ( that is , little , considering the size and great wealth of the place ) ; there was little taste for art ; few concerts were given , and there was no drama fit to entertain intellectual persons . Cincinnati was the Old Hunkers ' paradise . Separated from a Slave State only by a river one third of a mile wide , with her leading families connected by marriage with those of Virginia , Kentucky , and Maryland , and her business men having important relations with the South , there was no city- not even Baltimore - that was more saturated with the spirit of Hunkerism , - that horrid blending of vanity and avarice which made the Northern people equal sharers in the guilt of slavery , while taking the lion 's share of the profit . It was at Cincinnati , in 1836 , that a mob of most respectable citizens , having first " resolved ' * in public meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distributed " in the town , broke into the office of James G. Birney 's " Philanthropist , " and scattered the types , and threw the press into the river . It was at Cincinnati , in 1841 , that the authorities were compelled to fill the prisons with negroes to protect them from massacre . Similar scenes have occurred in other cities , but violence of this kind meant more at Cincinnati than in most places , for the people here have always been noted for their orderly habits and their regard for law . The war regenerated Cincinnati . We do not say began to regenerate it , because the word " regeneration " means but the beginning of a new life . There were few of the leading families which did not furnish to the Rebellion one adherent , and all men , of whatever class , were compelled to choose between their country and its foes . The great mass of the people knew not a moment of hesitation , and a tide of patriotic feeling set in which silenced , expelled , or converted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the South , so profitable and so corrupting , were broken up , and Cincinnati found better occupation in supplying the government with gunboats and military stores . The prestige of the old " aristocracy " was lost ; its power was broken ; it no longer controlled elections , nor monopolized offices , nor lowered the tone of public feeling . Cincinnati was born again , - began a new life . There is now prevalent among the rulers of the city that noblest trait of freemen , that supreme virtue of the citizen , - PUBLIC SPIRIT ; the blessed fruits of which are already apparent , and . v*ic** is aix*ut to rznder the city a true metrcpolic to the valey // of the Ohio , the fostering mother of all that aids and adorns civilization . Cincinnati , like New York , is a cluster of towns and cities , bearing various names , and situated in different States . Persons ambitious of municipal offices would do well to remove to this place ; since , within the limits of what is really Cincinnati , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - tiact and completely organized cities . A citizen of New York might well stand aghast at the announcement of such a fact as this , and only recover his consciousness to try mentally an impossible sum in the double rule of three : If one mayor and corporation , in a city of a million and a half of inhabitants , steal ten millions of dollars per annum , how much will seven mayors and seven corporations " appropriate " in a city of three hundred thousand inhabitants ? The reader is excused from " doing " this hard sum , and we hastei* to assure him that Cincinnati is governed by and for her own citizens , who take the same care of the public money as of their own private store . We looked into the Council *ihamber of Cincinnati one morning , and we can testify that the entire furniture of that apartment , though it is substantial and sufficient , cost about as much as some single articles in the councilmen 's room of the New York City Hall , - say the clock , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cincinnati are so primitive in their ideas , that they would regard the man who should steal the public money as a baser thief than he who should merely pick a private pocket . They have actually carried " this sort of thing " so far as to elect and re-elect as Mayor of the city proper that honest , able , generous Republican , CHARLES F. WILSTAC*I , a member of the great publishing house of Moore , Wilstach , and Baldwin , - a gentleman who , though justly proud of the confidence of his fellow-citizens , and enjoying the honor they have conferred upon him , uses the entire power , influence , and income of his office in promoting the higher welfare of the city . He is the great patron of the Mechanics ' Institute , which gave instruction last winter to two hundred and fifty evening pupils in drawing , mathematics , and engineering , at three dollars each for four months , besides affording them access to a library and pleasant rooms . Charles Wilstach , in short , is what Mr. Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Imagine New York electing Peter Cooper mayor ! It was like going back to the primitive ages , - to that remote period when Benjamin Franklin was printer and public servant , and when Samuel Adams served the State , - to see the Mayor of Cindnnati performing his full share of the labor of conducting a business that employs a hundred and fifty persons , and yet punctual at his office in the City Hall , and strictly attentive to its duties during*five of the best hours of the day . There are seven mayors about Cincinnati for the reasons following . On the southern bank of the Ohio , opposite the city , many large manufactories have found convenient sites , and thus the city of Covington has grown up , divided into two towns by the river Licking . Then there are five clusters of villas in the suburbs of Cincinnati , over the hill , each of which has deemed it best to organize itself into a city , in order to keep itself select and exclusive , and to make its own little laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural villages are business men of Cincinnati , who drive in to their stores every morning , and home again in the evening . Thus you may meet aldermen at every corner , and buy something in a store from a mayor , and get his autograph at the end of a bill , without being aware of the honor done you . No autographs are more valued in Cincinnati than the signatures of these municipal magnates . But let us look at the city . The river presents a novel and animated scene . On the Kentucky shore lies Covington , dark and low , a mass of brick factories // and tall chimneys , from which the blackest smoke is always ascending , and spreading over the valley , and filling it with smoke . Over Cincinnati , too , a dense cloud of smoke usually hangs , every chimney contributing its quota to the mass . The universal use of the cheap bituminous coal ( seventeen cents a bushel , - twenty-five bushels to a ton ) is making these Western cities almost as dingy as London . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blackens the curtains , soils the paint , and worries the ladies . Housekeepers assured us that the all-pervading smoke nearly doubles the labor of keeping a house tolerably dean , and absolutely prevents the spotless cle*anliness of a Boston or Philadelphia house . A lady who wears light-colored garments , ribbons , or gloves in Cincinnati must be either very young , very rich , or very extravagant : ladies of good sense or experience never think of wearing them . Clean hearts abound in Cincinnati , but not clean hands . The smoke deposits upon all surfaces a fine soot , especially upon men 's woollen clothes , so that a man can not touch his own coat without blackening his fingers . The stranger , for a day or two , keeps up a continual washing of his hands , but he soon sees the folly of it , and abandons them to their fate . A letter written at Cincinnati on a damp day , when the Stygian l ) all lies low upon the town , carries with it the odor of bituminous smoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This universal smoke is a tax upon every inhabitant , which can be estimated in money , and the sum total of which is millions per annum . Is there no remedy ? Did not Dr. Franklin invent a smoke-consuming stove ? Are there no Yankees in the West ? Before the traveller loitering along the levee has done wondering at the smoke , his eye is caught by the new wire suspension bridge , which springs out from the summit of the broad , steep levee to a lofty tower ( two hundred feet high ) near the water 's edge , and then , at one leap , clears the whole river , and lands upon another tower upon the Coyington side . From tower to tower the distance is one thousand and fifty-seven feet ; the entire length of the bridge is two thousand two hundred and fiftytwo feet ; and it is hung one hundred feet above low-water mark by two cables of wire . Seen from below and at a little distance , it looks like gossamer work , and as though the wind could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sight . But the tread of a drove of elephants would not bend nor jar it . The Rock of Gibraltar does not feel firmer under foot than this spider 's web of a bridge , over which trains *f cars pass one another , as well as ceaseless tides of vehicles and pedestrians . It is estimated that , besides its own weight of six hundred tons , it will sustain a burden of sixteen thousand tons . In other words , the whole population ef Cincinnati might get upon it without danger of being let down into the river . This remarkable work , constructed at a cost of one million and three quarters , was begun nine years ago , and has tasked the patience and the faith of the two cities severely ; but now that it is finished , Cincinnati looks foeward with confidence to the time when it will be a connecting link between Lake Erie and the Gulf of itlexico , and when Cincinnati will be only thirty hours from Mobile . The levee , which now extends five or six miles around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exhibits all the varieties of Western steamboats . It exhilarated the childish mind of the stranger to discover that the makers of school-books were practising no imposition upon the infant mind when they put . down in the geography such names as the " Big Sandy . " It was cheering , also , to know that one could actually go to Maysville , and see how General Jackson 's veto had affected it . A traveller must indeed be difficult to please who can not find upon the Cmcinnati levee a steamboat bound to a place he would like to visit . From far back in the coal mines of the Youghiogheny ( pronounced Yok-a-gau-nv ) to // *86*. high up the Red River , - from St. Paul to New Orleans , and all intermediate ports , - we have but to pay our money and take our choice of the towns upon sixteen thousand miles of navigable water . Among the rest we observed a steamboat about as large as an omnibus , fitted uplike a pedler 's wagon , and full of the miscellaneous wares which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steam from village to village along the shores of those interminable rivers , and , by renewing their supplies at the large towns , make their way for thousands of miles , returning home only at the end of the season . They can ascend higher up the streams than the large boats , and scarcely any " stage ' * of water is too low for them . Often as we had admired the four- horse pedlers ' wagons of New England , with their plated harness and gorgeous paint , we resolved that , when we turned pedler , it should be in such a snug little steamboat upon the rivers of the West . Other steamboats , as probably the reader is aware , are fitted up as theatres , museums , circuses , and moral menageries , and go from town to town , announcing their arrival by that terrific combination of steam-whistles which is called in the West a Cally-ope . What an advance upon the old system of strolling players and the barn ! " Then came each actor on his ass . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which when the performance is over he retires , waking the next morning at the scene of new triumphs . Along the summit of the steep levee , close to the line of stores , there is a row of massive posts three feet thick and twenty high - which puzzle the stranger . The swelling of the river brings the steamboats up to the very doors of the houses facing the river , and to these huge posts they are fasLened to keep them from being swept away by the rushing flood . From the summit of the levee we advance into the town , always going up hill , unless we turn to the right or left . Here is Philadelphia again , with its numbered streets parallel to the river , 235 and the cross-streets nawed after the trees which William Penn found grewing upon the banks of the Delaware , - " Walnut , " " Locust , " " Sycamore . " Here are long blocks of wholesale stores in the streets near the river , of Philadelphian plainness and solidity ; and as we ascend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern style of subdued Philadelphian ele .. gance . It is a solid , handsome town ,  --  the newer buildings of light-colored stone , very lofty , and well built ; the streets paved with the small pebbles ground smooth by the rushing Ohio , and as clean as Boston . In Fourth Street there is a dry-goods store nearly as large , and five times as handsome , as Stewart 's in New York , and several other establishments on the greatest scale , equal in every respect to those of the Atlantic cities . The only difference is , that in New York we have more of them . By the time we have passed Fifth Street , which is about half a mile from the river , we have reached the end of the elegant and splendid part of the city ; all beyond and around is shabby Philadelphia , begrimed with soot , and " blended in a common element " of smoke . The extensive and swarming German quarter is precisely like the German quarter of Philadelphia , ( though the Cincinnati lager-bier is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mansions are exactly such as the older houses of Philadelphia would be if Philadelphia burned bituminous coal . Every New-Yorker supposes , of course , that there must be in a large and wealthy city one pre-eminent and illustrious street like his own Fifth Avenue , where he is wont either to survey mankind from a club window , or , as mankind , be surveyed . There is no such street in Cincinnati , and for a reason which becomes apparent during the first long walk . When the stranger has panted up the slop&amp; on which the city is built , to a point one mile from the river , he sees looming up before him an almost precipitous hill , four hundred and sixty-two feet high , // which has been dug into , and pared down , until it has about as much beauty as an immense heap of gravel . Around the base of this unsightly mountain are slaughter-houses and breweries , incensing it with black smoke , and extensive pens filled with the living m*-teriatof barrelled pork . The traveller , who has already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbing for one day , naturally regards this hill as the end of all things in Cincinnati ; but upon coming up to it he diseovers the zigzag road to which allusion has before been made , and which leads by an easy ascent to the summit . Behold the Fifth Avenue of Cincinnati ! It is not merely the pleasant street of villas and gardens along the brow of the hill , though that is part of it . Mount to the cupola of the Mount Auburn Young Ladies ' School , which stands near the highest point , and look out over a sea of beautifully formed , umbrageous hills , steep enough to be picturesque , but not too steep to be convenient , and observe that upon each summit , as far as the eye can reach , is an elegant cottage or mansion , or cluster of tasteful villas , surrounded by groves , gardens , and lawns . This is Cincinnati 's Fifth Avenue . Here reside the families enriched by the industry of the low , smoky town . Here , upon these enchanting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gather the greater part of the population , leaving the city to its smoke and heat when the labors of the day are done . As far as we have seen or read , no inland city in the world surpasses Cincinnati in the beauty of its environs . They present as perfect a combination of the picturescjue and the accessible as can anywhere be found ; and there are still the primeval forests , and the virgin soil , to favor the plans of the artist in " capabilities . " The Duke of Newcastle 's party , one of whom was the Prince of Wales , were not flattering their entertainers when they pronounced the suburbs of Cincinnati the finest they had anywhere seen . The groups of villas , each upon its little hill , are the cities before mentioned , five of which are within sight of the young ladies who attend the liberally conducted seminary ofMount Auburn . The stranger is continually ' astonished at the magnitude and costliness of these residences . Our impression was , that they are not inferior , either in number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jamaica Plain ; while a few of them , we presume , are unequalled in America . The residence of Mr. Probasco is the most famous of these . Externally , it is a rather plain-looking stone house , something between a cottage and a mansion ; but the interior is highly interesting , as showing how much money to the square inch can be spent in the decoration of a house , provided the proprietor has unlimited resources and gives himself up to the work . For seven long years , we were informed , the owner of this house toiled at his experiment . Every room was a separate study . All the walls are wainscoted with oak , most exquisitely carved and polished , and the ceilings were painted by artists brought from Italy . It is impossible to conceive an interior more inviting , elegant , and harmonious than this . Thirty years ago the proprietor of this beautiful abode was an errand-boy in the establishment of which he was afterwards the head ; and when we had the impudence to look into his house , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral is obvious even here at the end of this poor paragraph , but it was staggering upon the spot . How absurd to be sick , owning such a house ! How ridiculous the idea of dying in it ! In this enchanting region is Lane Theological Seminary , of which Dr. Lyman Beecher was once President , and in which Henry Ward Beecher spent three years in acquiring the knowledge it cost him so much trouble to forget . Coming to this seat of theology from the beautiful city of Clifton , of which Mr. Probasco 's house is an ornament , and which consists of a few other mansions of similar elegance , the Seminary buildings looked rather dismal , // though they are better than the old barracks in which the students of Yale and Harvard reside . Thirty cheerful and athletic young gentlemen , and half a dozen polite and learned professors , constitute at present the theological family . The room in which Mr. Beecher lived is still about fifteen feet by ten , but it does not present the bare and forlorn appearance it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has . more furniture than the pine table and arm-chair which , tradition informs us , contented him , and which were the only articles he could contribute towards the furnishing of his first establishment . Cincinnati justly boasts of its Spring Grove Cemetery , which now encloses five hundred acres of this beautiful , undulating land . The present superintendent has introduced a very simple improvement , which enhances the beauty of the ground tenfold , and might well be universally imitated . He has caused the fences around the lots to be removed , and the boundaries to be marked by sunken stone posts , one at each corner , which just suffice for the purpose , but do not disfigure the scene . This change has given to the ground the harmony and pleasantness of a park . The monuments , too , are remarkable for their variety , moderation , and good taste . There is very little , if any , of that hideous ostentation , that mere expenditure of money , which renders Greenwood so melancholy a place , exciting far more compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead who have escaped their society . We would earnestly recommend the matiagers of other cemeteries not to pass within a hundred miles of Cincinnati without stepping aside to see for themselves how much the beauty of a burialground is increased by the mere removal of the fences round the lots . It took the superintendent of Spring Grove several years to induce the proprietors to consent to the removal of costly fences ; but one after another they yielded , and each removal exhibited more clearly the propriety of the change , and made converts to the new system . In the same taste he recommends the levelling of the mounds over the graves , and his advice has been generally followed . It is very pleasant for the rich people of Cincinnati to live in the lovely country over the hill , away from the heat and smoke of the town ; but it has its inconveniences also . It is partly because the rich people are so far away that the public entertainments of the city are so low in quality and so unfrequent . We made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - glad to escape the gloom and dinginess of the hotel , once the pride of the city , but now its reproach . Surely there is no other city of two hundred and fifty thousand inhabitants that is so miserably provided with the means of public amusement as Cincinnati . At the first theatre we stumbled into , where Mr. Owens was performing in the Bourcicault version of " The Cricket on the Hearth , " there was a large audience , composed chiefly of men . It was the very dirtiest theatre we ever saw . The hands of the ticket-taker were not grimy , - they were black . The matting on the floor , the paint , and all the interior , were thoroughly unclean ; and not a person in the audience seemed to have thought it necessary to show respect to the place , or to the presence of a thQusand of his fellow-citizens , by making any change in his dress . The ventilation was bad , of course . No fresh air could be admitted without exposing some of the audience to draughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is very pleasing and simple , was disfigured in every scene by the interpolation of what the actors call " gags , " - that , is , vulgar and stupid additions to the text by the actors themselves , - in which we were sorry to hear the " star " of the occasion setting a bad example . Actors ought to know that when Charles Dickens and Dion Bourcicault unite their admirable talents in the production of a play , no one else can add a line without marring the work . They might at least be aware that Western // colloquialisms , amusing as they are , do not harmonize with the conversation of am English cottage . Yet this Cincinnati audience was delighted with the play , in spite of all these drawbacks , so exquisitely adapted is the drama to iiiove and entertain human beings . At the West , along with much reckless and defiant unbelief in everything high and good , there is also a great deal of that terror-stricken pietism which refuses to attend the theatre unless it is very had indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the business of the theatre ; and , as a good theatre is necessarily a very expensive institution , it improves very slowly , although the Western people are in precisely that stage of development and culture to which the drama is best adapted and is most beneficial . We should naturally expect to find the human mind , in the broad , magnificent West , rising superior to the prejudices originating in the little sects of little lands . So it will rise in due time . So it has risen , in some degree . But mere grandeur of nature has no educating effect upon the soul of man ; else , Switzerland would not have supplied Paris with footmen , and the hackmen of Niagara would spare the tourist . It is only a human mind that can instruct a human mind . There is a man in Cincinnati , of small stature , and living in a small house of a street not easy to find , who is doing more to raise , inform , and ennoble Cincinnati than all her lovely hills and dales . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Unitarian Church of the Redeemer . His walls are not wainscoted , and there is about his house no umbrageous park nor verdant lawn . It has only pleased Heaven , so far , to endow him with a fine understanding , a noble heart , and an eloquent tongue . It is he , and half a dozen such as he , who constitute in great degree the civilizing force of Cincinnati . Upon leaving the theatre , we were attracted by a loud beating of drums to a building calling itself the " Sacred Museum : " Such establishments *e usually content with the word " morals ' ; but this one was " sacred . " From a balcony in front , two bass-drums and one bugle were filling all that part of the town with horrid noise , and in the entrance , behind the ticket-office , a huge negro was grinding out discord from an organ as big as an upright piano . We defy creation to produce another exhibition so entirely and profoundly atrocious as this . It consisted chiefly of wax figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Scott , and another , sitting bolt upright at a card-table , staring hideously ; the birth of Christ ; the trial of Christ ; Abraham Lincoln , dead and ghastly , upon a bier ; and other groups , all revolting beyond description . The only decently executed thing in this Sacred Museum was highly indecent ; it was a young lady in wax , who , before lying down , had forgotten to put on her night-gown . There was a most miserable Happy Family ; one or two monkeys , still and dejected ; a dismal , tired rooster , who wanted to go to roost , but could not in that glare of gas , and stood motionless on the bottom of the cage ; three or four common white rabbits ; and a mangy cat . Such was the Sacred Museum . Such are the exhibitions to which well-intentioned parents will take their children , while shrinking in affright from the theatre ! It is strange that this lucrative business of providing amusement for children and country visitors should have been so long abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town needs a place of amusement to which children can be occasionally taken , and it would not be difficult to arrange an establishment that would afford them great delight and do them no harm . How monstrous to lure boys to such a place as this " Sacred Museum , " - or to the " Museum " in New York , where a great creature , in the form of a woman , performs , in fleshcolored tights , the part of Mazeppa ! In all the large Western cities there is a place of evening entertainment called the " Varieties Theatre , " which ladies never attend , and in which three pleasures may be enjoyed at once , - // smoking , drinking lager-bier , and witnessing a performance upon the stage . The chief patrons of these establishments are gentlemen connected with navigation , and very young men who , for the price of a ticket , a cigar , and a glass of beer , purchase the flattering delusioiv4hat they are " seeing life , " and " going it with a perfect looseness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , farces , and the dancing of " beauteous Terpsichorean nymphs " ; and these succeed one another with not a minute 's intermission for three or four hours . At St. Louis , where gentlemen connected with navigation are numerous , the Varieties Theatre is large , highly decorated , conducted at great expense , and yields a very large revenue . To witness the performance , and to observe the rapture expressed upon the shaggy and good - humored countenances of the boatmen , was interesting , as showing what kind of banquet will delight a human soul starved from its birth . It likes a comic song very much , if the song refers to fashionable articles of ladies ' costume , or holds up to ridicule members of Congress , policemen , or dandies . It is not averse to a sentimental song , in which " Mother , dear , " is frequently apostrophized . It delights in a farce from which most of the dialogue has been cut away , while all the action is retained , - in which people are continually knocked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes much pleasure in seeing Horace Greeley play a part in a negro farce , and become the victim of designing colored brethren . But what joy , when the beauteous Terpsichorean nymph bounds upon the scene , rosy with paint , glistening with spangles , robust with cotton and cork , and bewildering with a cloud of gauzy skirts ! What a vision of beauty to a man who has seen nothing for days and nights but the hold of a steamboat and the dull shores of the Mississippi ! The Varieties Theatre of St. Louis , therefore , is a highly flourishing establishment , and the proprietor knows his business well enough to be aware that indecency never pays expenses in the United States , - as all will finally discover who try it . At Cincinnati there is also a Varieties Theatre , but such a theatre ! A vast and dirty barn , with whitewashed walls and no ceiling , in which a minstrel band of five men and two beauteous nymphs exerted themselves slightly to entertain an audience of thirty men and boys . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are able to state that beauteous Terpsichorean nymphs go about the world disguised in dingy calico , and only appear in their true colors upon the stage . Cincinnati , then , affords very slight and inferior facilities for holiday-keeping . We chanced to be in the city on the last Thanksgiving day , and were surprised to see seven tenths of all the stores open as usuaL In the German quarter there were no signs whatever of a public holiday : every place of business was open , and no parties of pleasure were going out . The wholesale stores and most of the American part of the city exhibited the Sunday appearance which an Eastern city presents on this day ; but even there the cessation of industry was not universal . And , after all , how should it be otherwise ? Where were the people to go ? What could they do ? There is no Park . There are no suburbs accessible without a severe struggle with the attraction of gravitation . There are no theatres fit to ' attend . There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art , no public gardens , no Fifth Avenue to stroll in , no steamboat* excursion , no Hoboken . There ought to be in Cincinnati a most exceptionally good and high social life to atone for this singular absence of the usual means of public enjoyment ; but of that a stranger can have little knowledge . When we turn to survey the industry of Cincinnati , we find a much more advanced and promising state of things . Almost everything is made in Cincinnati that is made by man . There are prodigious manufactories of furniture , // machinery , clothing , iron ware , and whatever else is required by the six or eight millions of people who live within easy reach of the city . The book-trade - especially the manufacturing of schoolbooks and other books of utility - has attained remarkable development . Sargent , Wilson , and Hinkle employ about two hundred men , chiefly in the making of school-books ; of one series of " Readers , " they produce a million dollars ' . worth per annum , - the most profitable literary property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore , Wilstach , and Baldwin employ all their great resources in the manufacture of their own publications , many of which are works of high character and great cost . Recently they have invested one hundred thousand dollars in the production of one work , - the history of Ohio 's part in the late war . Robert Clarke &amp; Co. publish law books on a scale only equalled by two or three of the largest law publishers of the Eastern cities . Cincinnati ranks third among the manufacturing cities of the Union , and fourth in the manufacture of books . Here , as everywhere in the United States , the daily press supplies the people with the greater part of their daily mental food , and nowhere else , except in New York , are the newspapers conducted with so much expense . The " Cincinnati Commercial " telegraphed from Washington fourteen columns of General Grant 's Report , at an expense of eleven hundred dollars , and thus , gave it to its readers one day before the New York papers had a word of it . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Washington , New York , Venice , London , and Frankfort , Ky. , five columns of telegrams , and the usual despatch by the Atlantic cable . The " Gazette " is not less spirited and enterprising , and both are sound , patriotic , Republican journals . The " Enquirer , " of Democratic politics , very liberally conducted , is as unreasonable as heart could wish , and supplies the Republican papers with many a text . The " Times** is an evening paper , Republican , and otherwise commendable . Gentlemen who have long resided in Cincinnati assure us that the improvement in the tone and spirit of its daily press since the late regenerating war is most striking . ' It is looked to now by the men of public spirit to take the lead in the career of improvement upon which the city is entering . The conductors of the press here are astonishingly rich . Think of an editor having the impudence to return the value of his estate at five millions of dollars ! Visitors to Cincinnati feel it , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the native wine ; and to facilitate the performance of this duty , the landlord of the Burnet House publishes in his daily bill of fare twelve varieties of American wine , from three States , Ohio , Missouri , and California . The cheapest is the Ohio Catawba , one dollar a bottle ; the dearest is Missouri champagne , at three dollars and a half . The wine culture , it appears , is somewhat out of favor at present among the farmers of Ohio . A German family , many-handed , patient , and economical , occupying a small vineyard and paying no wages , finds the business profitable ; but an American , who lives freely , and depends upon hired assistance , is likely to fail . A vineyard requires incessant and skilful labor . The costly preparation of the soil , the endless prunings and hoeings , the great and watchful care required in picking , sorting , and pressing the grapes , in making and preserving the wine , the many perils to which the crop is exposed at every moment of its growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vines begin to bear , all conspire to discourage and defeat the ordinary cultivator . The " rot " is a very severe trial to human patience . The vines look thrifty , the grapes are &gt; : - ge and abundant , and all goes well , until the time when the grapes , being fully grown , are about to change color . Then a sudden blight occurs , and two thirds of the whole crop of grapes , the result of the year 's labor , wither and spoil . The cause , probably , is the ex // haustion of some elements in the soil needful to the supreme effort of Nature to perfect her work . Nevertheless , the patient Germans succeed in the business , and sell their wine to good advantage to the large dealers and bottlers . The Longworth wine-cellar , one of the establis*hed lions of the city , cheers the thirsty soul of man . There we had the pleasure of seeing , by a candle 's flickering light , two hundred thousand bottles of wine , and of walking along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large enough to house a married Diogenes , or to drown a dozen Dukes of Clarence , and some of them containing five thou sand gallons of the still unvexed Catawba . It was there that we made acquaintance with the " Golden Wedding " champagne , the boast of the late proprietor , - an acquaintance which we trust will ripen into an enduring friendship . If there is any better wine than this attainable in the present state of existence , it ought , in consideration of human weakness , to be all poured into the briny deep . It is a very honest cellar , this . Except a little rock candy to aid fermentation , no foreign ingredient is employed , and the whole process of making and bottling the wine is conducted with the utmost care . Nicholas Longworth was neither an enlightened nor a public-spirited man ; but , like most of his race , he was scrupulously honest . Indeed , we may truly say , that there is in Cincinnati a general spirit of fidelity . Work is generally done well there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every one thinks of pork in connection with Cincinnati . We had the curiosity to visit one of the celebrated porkmaking establishments , " The Banner Slaughter and Pork-packing House , " which , being the newest , contains all the improved apparatus . In this establishment , hogs weighing five or six hundred pounds are killed , scraped , dressed , cut up , salted , and packed in a barrel , in twenty seconds , on an average ; and at this rate , the work is done , VOL . XX. - NO. ii8. x6 ten hours a day , during the season of four months . The great secret of such rapidity is , that one man does one thing only , and thus learns to do that one thing with perfect dexterity . We saw a man there who , all day and every day , knocks pigs down with a hammer ; another who does nothing but " stick " them ; another who , with one clean , easy stroke of a broad , long-handled cleaver , decapitates the hugest hog of Ohio . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really , this Banner Pork-house is one of the most curious things in the world , and claims the attention of the polite reader . It is a large , clean , new brick building , with extensive yards adjoining it , filled with hogs from the forests and farms of Ohio , Indiana , and Kentucky . From these yards to the third story of the house there is an inclined plane , up which a procession of the animals march slowly to their doom from morning until evening . Here is the first economy . The thing to be done is , to transfer the pigs from those yards to the basement of the building , and , on the way , convert them into salt pork . They walk to the scene of massacre .. at the top of the building , and the descent to the cellar accomplishe*s itself by the natural law which causes everything to seek the centre of the earth . Arrived at the summit , the fifteen foremost find themselves in " a tight place , " - squeezed into a pen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lie down . There are two of these pens , and two " pen men " ; so that the moment one pen is empty , there is another ready filled , and the work thus goes on without interruption . The fifteen animals which stand compressed , with their heads thrust upward , awaiting the stru ke of fate , express their emotions in the language natural to them . and the noise is great . The executioner , armed with a longhandled , slender hamnier , and sitting astride of the fence , gives to each . of these yelling creatures his quietus by a blow upon the head . The , pig does not fall when he is struck ; he can not ; // 242 Cincinnati . he only stares and becomes silent . The stranger who is unable to witness the execution has an awful sense of the progress of the fell work by the gradual cessation of the noise . We mention here , for the benefit of political econornjsts , that this knocker-down , who does the most disagreeable and laborious part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the house . He does not rank as an artist at all , but only as a laborer . Readers of Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill know why . When silence within the pen announces the surrender of its occupants , a door is opened , and the senseless hogs are laid in a row up an inclined plane , at the bottom of which is a long trough of hot water . One of the artists , called " the Sticker , " now appears , provided with a long ; thin , pointed knife , and approaches the pig nearest the steaming trough , gently4ifts its fore leg , and gives it one easy , delicate , and graceful thrust in the throat . Along the trough , on each side of it , is a row of men , each with an instrument in his hand , waiting to begin ; and apart from them stands the Head-Scalder , who ranks second in the corps , having a task of all but the greatest difficulty to perform . Scald a pig ten seconds too long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes out as red as a lobster ; let the water be too cool , or keep the animal in it too short a time , and the labor of scraping is trebled- Into the hot water the hogs are soused at intervals of twenty seconds , and the Scaider stands , watching the clock , and occasionally trying the temperature of the water with his finger , or the adherence of the hair on the creature first to be handled- " Number One , " he says , at length . By a machine for the purpose , Number One is turned over upon a long , declining table , where he lies smoking . At the same instant two men pull out his valuable bristles and put them in a barrel , and twO other men scrape one side of him with scrapers . In a few seconds , these turn hIm*over and pass him on to tv* other scrapers , who scrape the other side and then slide him along to four other men , who trim and finish him , leaving not a hair upon his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands of two " gamble-men , " who in -- sert a stick to keep the hind legs apart , and , by the aid of a machine , hang him up with his head downward . Next , the animal is consigned to the great artist of all , who performs upon him the operation so much in favor among the nobility of Japan . This artist , we regret to say , but will not conceal from a too fastidious public , is called " the Gutter . " One long , swift cut down the whole length of the body , - two or three rapid , in-and-out cuts in the insid* , - and the entire respiratory and digestive apparatus lies smoking upon a table , under the hands of men who are removing from it the material for lard* This operation , here performed in twenty seconds , and which is frequently d9ne by the same man fifteen hundred times* a day , takes an ordinary butcher ten minutes . This man earns six dollars and a half * day , while no one else receives more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his substitute , who has seen the thing done for years , can only perform it one fifth as fast , and the day 's work of the house is reduced . to one fifth of its ordinary production . The long room in which the ureatures are put to death , scalded , and japanned presents , as may be unagined , a most horrid scene of massacre and blood , - of steaming water and flabby , naked , quivering hogs ,  --  of men in oil-skin suits all shining with wet and grease . The rest of the establishment is perfectly clean and agreeableThe moment the body of the animal is emptied , a boy inundates it from a hose , and then another boy pushes it along the wire from which it hangs on a wheel , and takes i ? to its place in the cooling-room , where it hangs aLl night . This cooling-room is a curious specta- - cle . It contains two regiments of sus -- pended hogs , arranged in long , regular rows : one regiment , the result of tQday 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutting up of these huge* carcasses is accomplished with th9* // same easy ax*d wonderful rapidity . The first that we chanced to see cut to pieces was an enormous fellow of six hundred pounds , and it was done in just one third of a minute . Two men tumbled him over upon a wagon , wheeled him to the scales , where his weight was instantly ascertained and recorded . Near by was the cutting-* table , upon which he was immediately flopped . Two simultanous blows with a cleaver severed his head and his hind quarters from the trunk , and the subdivision of these was accomplished by three or four masterly cuts with the same instrument . Near the table are the open mouths of as many large wooden pipes as there are kinds of piece in a hog , and these lead to the various apartments below , where the several pieces are to be further dealt with . Gently down their well-greased pipe slip the hams to the smokingdepartment ; away glide the saltingpieces to the cellar ; the lard-leaves slide softly down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their pipe to the sausage-room ; the tongue , the feet , and every atom of the flesh , start on their journey to the places where they are wanted ; and thus , in the twenty seconds , the six-hundred-pounder has been cut to pieces and distributed all over an extensive buildin'g . The delivery of three finished hogs a minute requires the following force of men : two pen-men ; one knockerdown ; one sticker ; two bristle-snatchers ; four scrapers ; six shavers ( who remove the hair from parts not reached by the scrapers ) ; two gamble-men ; one gutter ; one hose-boy ; one slideboy ; one splitter ( who fastens the animal open to facilitate cooling ) ; two attendants upon the cutters ; one weigher ; two cleaver-men ; four knife-men ; @ne ham-trimmer ; one shoulder-trimmer ; one packer ; six ham-salters ; one weigher and brander ; one lard-man ; one book-keeper ; seven porters and laborers , - in all , fifty men . The system ; therefore , enables one man to convert into pork thirty hogs a day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the animals sixty cents each for the privilege of killing them , and derive their profit from the refuse . The bristles of a hog are worth seventeen cents ; his tongue , five cents ; the hair and the fat of the intestines pay the entire cost of killing , dressing , and packing . There is a moral in all this . In such establishments , a business which in itself is disgusting , and perhaps bar barizing , almost ceases to be so , and the part of it which can not be deprived of its disgusting circumstances is performed by a very few individuals . Twenty men , in four months , do all that is disagreeable in the slaying of one hundred and eighty thousand hogs , and those twenty men , by the operation of well-known laws , are sure to be the persons to whom the work is least offensive and least injurious . There are many other industrial establishments in Cincinnati that are highly interesting , but we can not dwell upon them . One thing surprises the visitor from the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Western country by very young men . We met a gentleman at Cincinnati , aged thirty-two , who is chief proprietor and active manager of five extensive iron works in five different cities , one of which - the one at Ciiicinnati - employs a hundred and twenty men . He began life at fourteen , a poor boy , - was helped to two thousand dollars at twenty-one , - started in iron , - prospered , - founded similar works in other cities , - went to the war and contracted to su , pply an army with biscuit , - took the camp fever , - lost twenty thousand dollars , came back to his iron , - throve as before , - gave away twenty-five thousand dollars last year to benevolent operations , and is now as serene and smiling as though he had played all his life , and had not a care in the world . And this reminds us to repeat that the man wanted in the West is the man who knows how to make and do , not the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // fellow of whom we speak makes nuts , bolts , and screws , and succeeds , in spite of Pittsburg , by inventing quicker and better methods . Churches flourish in Cincinnati , and every shade of belief and unbelief has its organization , or at least its expression . Credulity is daily notified in the newspapers , that " Madame Draskouski , the Russian wizard , foretells events by the aid of a Magic Pebble , a present from the Emperor of China , " and that " Madame Ross has a profound knowledge of the rules of the Science of the Stars , and can beat the world in telling the past , the present , and the future . " To the opposite extreme of human intelligence Mr. Mayo ministers in the Church of the Redeemer , and many of his wise and timely discourses reach all the thinking public through the daily press . The Protestant churches , here as everywhere , are elegant and well filled . The clergy are men-of-all-work . A too busy and somewhat unreasonable public looks to them to serve as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , in short , to do most of the work which , being " everybody 's business , " nobody is inclined to do . Few of the Western clergy are indigenous ; it is from the East that the supply chiefly comes , and the clergy do not appear to feel themselves at home in the West . In all Cincinnati there are but three Protestant clergymen who have been there more than five years . The Catholic churches are densely filled three or four times every Sunday , and the institutions of that Church are conducted with the vigor which we see everywhere in the United States ' . Fortunate , indeed , are the Catholics of Cincinnati in having at their head that gentle , benignant , and patriotic man , Archbishop Purcell . It was pleasant to hear this excellent prelate , when he spoke of the forces of the United States in the late war , use the expression , " our army . " Every bishop does not do so . It was pleasant , too , to hear him say , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we all agree , thank goodness . " The Young Men 's Christian Association is in great vigor at Cincinnati . It provides a reading room , billiards , a gymnasium , bowling alleys , and many other nice things for young men , at the charge of one dollar per , annum . The Association here is said to be free from that provincial bigotry which , at Chicago , refused to invite to the annual banquet Robert Collyer and the young men of his church , because they were Unitarians . And this leads natui*ally to the topic which interested us most at Cincinnati , - the happy way in which the Jews are mingling there with their fellow-citizens , and the good influence they are exerting . There are twelve thousand Jews in the city . Some of the large manufactories and mercantile houses have Jewish proprietors , who enjoy the social consideration naturally belonging to their position . The Jews are worthily represented in the government of the city , in the boards controlling public institutions , and in those which administer private charity . Several of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of men whose aid is never solicited in vain for a suitable object , and whose benefactions are limited only by their means or by their duty , - never by unwillingness to bestow , - and who. value wealth only as a means of safety and education to their families , and of opportunity to bestow those advantages upon others . Christians in considerable numbers attend the beautiful synagogues , and Jews respond by going to Christian churches . And , 0 most wonderful of all ! Jewish rabbis and Christian clergymen - Orthodox clergymen too , as they are ridiculously called - " exchange pulpits " ! Here we have before us the report of a sermon delivered last March before a Congregational church of Cincinnati by Dr. Max Lilienthal , one of the most eminent and learned rabbis in the country . His sermon was an argument for perfect toleration of beliefs , - even the most eccentric , - provided the conduct and the disposition are what they should be . // " Religion is right , " said he ; " theology , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preach occasionally in the synagogues , and find that a good Christian sermon is a good Jewish one also . We have , too , a lecture delivered by another rabbi , Dr. Isidor Kalisch , before the Young Men 's Literary and Social Union of Indianapolis , which is bold even to audacity . He told the young gentlemen that the prevalence of Christianity in the Roman Empire was not an escape from barbarism , but a lapse into it . " As sooN , " said he , " as Christianity began spreading over the Roman Empire , all knowledge , arts , and sciences died away , and the development of civilization was retarded and checked . " Of course any attempt to express the history of five centuries in twenty words must be unsuccessful . This attempt is : but the boldness of the opinion does not appear to have given offence . The learned Doctor further gave his hearers to understand , that knowledge is the source of all civilization , " and theology the chief obstacle in its way . The eyes of every stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with domes and minarets like a Turkish mosque . This is the " Reformed Synagogue , " of which Dr. Isaac M. Wise is pastor , - a highly enlightened and gifted man . It is a truly beautiful building , erected at a cost of three hundred thousand dollars by one of the best architects in the West , Mr. James Keys Wilson , who also built the Court-House and PostOffice of Cincinnati . The interior , for elegance and convenience combined , is only equalled by the newest interiors of Chicago , and even by them it is not surpassed . Except some slight peculiarities about the altar , it is arranged precisely like one of our Protestant churches , and the service approaches . very nearly that of the Unitarians who use a liturgy . It is the mission of Dr. Wise to assist in delivering his people from the tyranny of ancient superstitions by calling their attention to the weightier matters of the law . Upon some of the cherished traditions of the Jews he makes open war , and prepares the way for their not distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their creed and customs . For the use of his congregation he has prepared a little book entitled " The Essence of Judaism , " from which the following are a few sentences , gathered here and there : - " It is not the belief of this or that dogma , but generous actions from noble motives , which the sacred Scripture calls the path of salvation . " " The noblest of all human motives is to do . good for goodness ' sake . " " The history of mankind teaches , that man was not as wicked as he was foolish ; his motives were better than his judgment . " " Reward or punishment is the natural consequence of obedience or disobedience to God 's laws . " " Great revolutions in history always resulted in the progress of humanity . " " The first duty a man owes himself is the preservation of his life , health , and limbs . " " The special laws of the Sabbath are : x . To rest from all labor ; 2 . To recruit our physical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctify our moral nature ; 4 . To improve our intellect . " " The best maxim of conduct to our parents is , treat them as you would wish to be treated by your children . " " N0 offensive words oractions afford a shadow of justification for killing a human being , or injuring him in his limbs or health . " " Only self-defence with equal arms , defence of others , or the defence . of our country against invasion or rebellion , are exceptions to the above law of the Lord . " " Domestic happiness depends exclusively upon the unadulterated affections and the inviolable chastity of parents and children . " " Palestine is now defiled by barbarism and iniquity ; it is the holy land no more . The habitable earth must become one holy land . " " The sons and daughters of the covenant have the solemn duty to be INTELLIGENT . " " Punishment must be intended only to correct the criminal and to protect society against crimes . " // In the same spirit he conducts " The Israelite , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Humanity the object of Religion , " is the title of one article in the number before us , and it expresses the whole aim and tendency of the movement which the editor leads . Noihing is more probable than that soon the observance of Saturday will be abolished , and that of Sunday substituted . - It is impossible that the enlightened Jews of Cincinnati can continue to attach importance to a distinction which is at once so trivial and so inconvenient . Indeed , we hear that some of the Jews of Baltimore have begun the change by holding their Sabbath schools on Sunday . Who-knows but that some rabbi , bold and wise , shall appear , who will lead his people to withdraw the bar from intermarriage with Christians , and that at last this patient and long-suffering race shall cease to be " peculiar , ** and merge themselves in mankind ? The golden rule seems to run in the very blood of the best Jews . One of the publications of Dr. Lilienthal is a History of the Israelites from the days of Alexander to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestors from blind and merciless bigotry ; and then states in a few words the revenge which his people propose to take for fifteen hundred years of infamy , isolation , and outrage . " We have accompanied , ** he says , " the poor exile through centuries of agony and misery ; we have heard his groaning and his lamentations . The dark clouds of misery and persecution have passed away ; the bloody axe of the executioner , the rack and stake of a fanatic inqnisition and clergy , were compelled to give way to reason and humanity ; the roar of prejudice and blind hatred had to cease before the sweet voice of justice and kindness . Israel stands , while his enemies have vanished away from the arena of history ; their endeavors to make Israel faithless to his God and his creed have proved futile and abortive . Israel has conquered politically and religiously . Day after day witnesses the crumbling to pieces of the barriers that have secluded them from intercourse with their fellow-citizens ; the old code of laws has become obsolete , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jew , not only enjoying all rights and privileges with his Christian brethren , but fully deserving them , and excelling in every department of life in which he now is allowed and willing to engage . And his religion - the holy doctrine of an indivisible Unity of God , of mati 's creation in the image of God , of our destination , to become by virtue , justice , and charity contented in this , and happy in after life - is daily gaining more ground as the only religion complying with . the demands of reason and our destination on earth . And Israel does not falter in the accomplishment of its holy mission , - to be the redeeming Messiah to all mankind , to become*a nation of priests , teaching and preaching the truth . " The noble rabbis of Cincinnati are an enlightening and civilizing power in the city , and their fellow-citizens know it and are grateful for it . A place like Cincinnati needs the active aid of every man in her midst who is capable of public spirit . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much less than the proper proportion of cultivated intelligence . The wealthy men of Cincinnati must beware of secluding themselves in their beautiful villas on the other side of the hill , and leaving the city to its smoke and ignorance . The question for Cincinnati , and indeed for the United States , to consider , was well stated by Mr. Mayo in his celebrated lecture upon " Health and Holiness in Cincinnati , " one of the most weighty , pathetic , eloquent , and wise discourses we ever read : " Shall our Western city children be saved to lead the civilization of America by their superior manhood and womanhood ? or shall they be buried out of sight , or mustered into the invalid corps ' before they are thirty years of age , and hard-headed Patrick , slow and sturdy Hermann , and irrepressible Sambo , walk in and administer the affairs of the country over their graves ? "
