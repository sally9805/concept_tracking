Or the many attempts at an exact physical analysis and description of the processes of articulate utterance , and their complete and consistent representation in an alphabet , no one has come before the Englishspeaking public with such pretensions as this . Its author , who appears to be an esteemed elocutionist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it , and unbounded expectations of results to be accomplished by it . The degree of his faith is shown by the offer , - a liberal one , from his point of view , and creditable to his disinterestedness and patriotism , - made by him , to the British government , to give up the advantage which he might expect to draw from its copyright , and present it freely to the nation , if the government , on its side , would bear the expense of the inaugural publication , and enable him for a time to act as public teacher of the system , thus introducing it more rapidly and thoroughly to general currency . The proposal was not accepted ; red tape , if nothing else , was in the way ; the Ministry declared itself to be in possession of no funds which were available for such a purpose . Mr. Bell details the course and end of the negotiation in his introductory chapter , confident that his readers ' will sigh with him over the narrowness of a policy which could suffer such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much used to the sight of inventors aggrieved by the stolid indifference of governments and communities to the transcendent merits of their pet devices , to be won over to Mr. Bell 's side on his own showing alone . But he is strongly backed by supporters of high rank and unimpeachable character . More than one much-esteemed authority in phonetic science , inventors of alphabetic schemes which the new system comes to rival and supplant , have given it , with praiseworthy candor and liberality , their unqualified indorsement . Among these , our countryman , Professor Halderman , and Mr. Alexander J. Ellis , especially the latter , are conspicuous . Hardly any other English writer upon such themes , if any , has won so high a reputation as Mr. Ellis ; and when he declares that , // having in view not only his own investigations , but also those of the principal Continental scholars , whom he names , he yet is obliged to say that he had no knowledge of alphabetics as a science until he was made acquainted with Mr. Bell 's system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor , we see that it is at least deserving of the most careful examination . Mr. Bell further rests its merits upon the resuits of practical experiments undertaken with it , and described in his book by Mr. Ellis and other disinterested persons . They were conducted after the following fashion : A number of gentlemen - philologists , foreigners , men acquainted with strange tongues , or strange dialects of familiar tongues - were assembled at Mr. Bell 's rooms , and dictated to him a series of specimens of languages unknown to him , - specimens made in part as idiomatic in character and difficult of reproduction as possible . These he wrote carefully down in his alphabet . his sons , who had ha* a few weeks ' training in the use of the system , were now called in , and the records placed before them , and the young men read them off almost immediately , with the most surprising faithfulness , appearing to reproduce each articulation , tone , and peculiarity of utterance , precisely as it had been originally given . No other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , could have stood such a test as this ; none , in fact , has ever attempted so comprehensive a task . For there is nothing uttered by human organs which Mr. Bell does not claim to represent with equal fidelity . In the pages of his book we find the written equivalents , along with articulate sounds , of sighs , groans , sobs , coughs , sneezes , hiccoughs , laughs , chuckles , kisses , sneers , hems , and haws , &amp;c. ; nay , he even attempts an imitation of the noise of grinding , and of planing and sawing wood . At the same time , the means resorted to are simple and easily learned . Their peculiarity consists in their being throughout representatives of physical acts . Each sign , or element of a compound sign , indicates a position or act of the organs of utterance , and is founded upon an ingenious and natural symbolism . After a thorough preliminary study , therefore , the system of characters is self-interpreting ; and it is sufficiently broad and extensible to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , which the voice of man can utter to the ear . It is a universal alphabet , resting on a true and solid basis ; it renders speech visible . If all these claims are well founded , every one can see that Mr. Bell 's alphabet ought to be made known as soon and as widely as possible ; and wh4her they are so , is the question we propose to discuss here . Of course , in the space at our command , and without the type representing Mr. Bell 's characters , we can not , by any means , treat the // subject in all its parts and all its relations ; but perhaps enough can be said to give our readers the means of forming a tolerably clear and correct opinion respecting it . There are obviously three principal points , to which our inquiries must be directed : first , is Mr. Bell 's physical analysis complete and accurate ? second , is his system of written characters plain and convenient ? and third , supposing both these questions to be answered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ device , its sphere of profitable application ? Without attempting to take up the points stated in systematic order , we will yet endeavor to keep them distinctly in view . Our examination of our author 's alphabet will best begin with the consonants , since they are the vastly easier part to be dealt with of the system of articulated sounds , their mode of production being , for the most part , within reach of our observation , when a little trained and practised , of our own organs of utterance . The fundamental consonant symbol chosen by Mr. Bell is a curve , open on one side , - a C. This typifies an obstruction to the free passage of the breath , effected , within the oral cavity , by the approximation of the mouth organs , - of tongue and palate , or of lip and lip . In the position of a C , it signifies an approach of the back part of the tongue to the soft palate , such as produces the German sound of c/i in ac/i ; turned over , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the forward surface of the tongue ( Mr. Bell gives it the technical name of " front " ) to the neighboring hard palate , producing the German c/i sound in ic/i ; with the curve turned under , the near application of the point of the tongue behind the teeth ; with the curve to the right , the approach of lip to lip . If the opening of the curve is closed by a straight line drawn across its ends , complete closure of the organs , forming a surd mute , is intimated ; in the C-position , a k ; in the Q - position , a t ; in the a-position , a p . These are made sonant , or connected respectively into g , d , b , by a line drawn from the middle of the curve within , toward its opening ; such a line symbolizing here , as elsewhere , that position of the vocal chords in which sonant utterance is produced . Once more , the same characters are made nasal , signs for ng , n , m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bent one , closing only at one end , to represent the uvula , whose pendency opens the channel from the mouth to the nostrils . Here are already sixteen letters of the new alphabet , in part standing for the sounds most common in all languages , of most distinct formation , and easiest systematic representation ; no exception can be *aken to them in any way . But the foundation-sign admits two further modifications , in connection with which certain weaknesses appear . In the first place , by indenting the consonantal curve at // its back ( like a figure 3 ) , Mr. Bell typifies a close contact of the organs along the middle line of closure , with passage left for the breath at the sides . Of sounds so formed , our 1 is the model , being produced , as every one has noticed , by an application of the tip of the tongue to the roof of the mouth , while the intonated breath finds exit on both sides of the contact ; and with our author 's designation of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its next of kin , no fault can be found . When , however , we are asked to believe that our th-sounds ( in tHn and tken ) , and our f and v , are of the same quality , - sounds of central closure and lateral opening , - and therefore to be written with analogous characters , we at once demur , and begin to suspect that our author is not incapable of being misled into wrongly apprehending and falsely describing the formation of spoken letters , by the facility of thus finding for them a ready place in his system . We are as sure as we can wish to be , that the quality claimed for these sounds in no wise belongs to them ; nor has it been ascribed to them , so far as we are aware , by any previous authority . But Mr. Bell 's signs for th involve , we think , another false element , which they share with the sibilant signs . By attaching , namely , recurved ends to his fundamental consonant character , he intimates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of such mixed articulation , according to him , are our s and s/i , the former produced mainly by the " front " of the tongue , hut with aid from the tip ; the latter , by the tip of the tongue , with aid from the front . Here , certainly , he is incontestably wrong ; the essential character of these two sounds is due to a near approximation of the tongue to two points on the front palate ; their difference , to the different situation of the two points , that for s being farther forward , it . is comparatively a matter of indifference whether they be produced by the point or the front of the tongue ; and when we form them , as we usually do , with the front , the point has nothing whatever do with them ; we may envelop it , or push it away from its ordinary position , by artificial means , without at all affecting the character of the articulation . This same character of " mixture , " namely , of the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell to the tlz sounds . In fact , his signs for dt and s differ only by the curve of the former being " divided , " or modified to show central closure . The real distinction between the two , however , is , that the s is produced just back of the teeth , at a point where a close contact , giving a t , is possible ; while the til is the closest contact which can be formed between the tongue and the teeth themselves . If there are any sounds in our spoken alphabet which ought to be distinctly recognized as " mixed , " they are the f , v , and tk , since these // bring into action the teeth , a set of organs which are not elsewhere directly active . Mr. Bell 's system , however , provides no sign for such mixture as this . The th , accordingly , he treats as we have just seen ; and , in his ordinary designation of f and v , he takes no notice of their being otherwise than purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scheme of consonants where we deem him not less wrong in theory and unsuccessful in designation , but we can not dwell upon them . We have picked out the most palpable errors , - enough to show , as we think , that his alphabet , even upon this side , is open to serious objection ; that it is not , as he claims , the complete and undistorted reflection to the eye of the physical processes of utterance , but does violence to nature , both by introducing symbols for unreal acts , and by omitting to symbolize others having a real existence and importance . We come , then , with a decidedly unfavorable presumption against Mr. Bell 's accuracy to the examination of what he has done for the infinitely more difficult theory of the vowels . Compared with the production of the consonants , that of the vowels is a mystery . Modern physicists , especially Helmholtz , have done a great deal of late toward the acoustic explanation of the vowels , toward showing why the one makes a different impression upon the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receives its characteristic quality has not been correspondingly advanced . It is , to be sure , evident that the throat and mouth cavity , upward ( if not downward also ) from the vocal chords , form a kind of tube or pipe , whose variations in length , shape , dimension , impresses upon the outgoing current of air those differences of vibration which the sense apprehends as vowel tones . And some of the main parts of the differentiating action are within easy reach of our observation . Thus , in the series of vowels instanced in bat , bet , bit , beet , we perceive the gradual approach of the middle of the tongue to the roof of the mouth , as we do the gradual rounding of the lips in the series cot , call , cole , could , cool . Yet the latter series can be produced , in tolerable purity of tone , without the aid of the lips ; nor do we fully know , in the one case or in the other , how far the action we observe is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that the essential thing in each case is the different distance of the vocal chords from the lips ; another assumes a pipe with an orifice shifting from point to point along the surface of the tongue ; and so on ; but the man who , skilful alike in physics and in physiology , possessed of a subtile power of observation upon the movements of his own organs , and armed with instruments and skill in using them , should be able to settle all these vexed questions , has not yet appeared . Mr. Bell , certainly , is not the man . // His vowel system has a general analogy with his consonant system . He assumes three fundamental positions of the tongue ,  --  one with its back part , one with its front , one with both back and front , brought toward the palate ; and three degrees of approach , " high , " " mid , " and " low , " for each of the three positions , " front , " " back , " and " mixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applying to it the " roundmo " ' action of the lips ; each of these eighteen he doubles again , by claiming that two different sounds are given forth through any " configurative aperture , " according as the condition of the tube or cavity behind it is " primary " or " wide , " that is to say , left negative , or positively distended . Thus he obtains thirty-six vowel positions for as many vowels , and he claims that practically they are found sufficient , although , in the shape of certain diacritical modifiers to the three fundamental postures of the tongue and the three degrees of approach , he holds in reserve the means of increasing them , if desirable , to three hundred and twenty-four ! The means by which all this is intimated to the eye is very simple and ingenious . The fundamental vowel character is an I , symbolizing ( as above noticed ) the position of the vocal chords in sonant vibration . Subsidiary signs attached to this show the action of the tongue and lips . A transverse mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The marks of lingual approach are fastened on at the top and bottom ; at the top for " high " approach , at the bottom for " low , " at both top and bottom for " mid " ; on the right for " front " position , on the left for " back , " on both right and left for " mixed . " All vowel signs are thus long and slender , all consonant ones broad and round ; and it is intended that the former , in their ordinary lowercase forms , shall , like our f and j , rise above or fall below the line which the others occupy . Notwithstanding the fulness and regularity of this scheme , and its unquestionable advantages as a mode of notation , we can not but regard it as an essentially artificial one , not so much growing out of the facts as imposed upon them , ingeniously incorporating some of the obvious features of physical production , but far from involving that minute and accurate knowledge of details to which it makes pretence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction of the " primary " and " wide " conditions of the organs , furnishing two different vowels , behind each " configurative aperture " ; we can not persuade ourselves that this is otherwise than purely imaginary , an arbitrary figment . As examples of vowels related to one another in the manner claimed ( the first " primary , " the second " wide " ) , he gives us up and ask , eel and ill , pool and pull , ell and man , all and on ; all of which , however , we // regard as produced by positions of the organs differing notably from one another in the ordinary manner , or by changes of the configurative aperture itself . Another objectionable feature is the treatment of* the labial modification as in itself of one and the same degree and value in all vowels , or as governed in respect to closeness by the degree of lingual approximation which it accompanies . This " rounding " effect , as our author terms it , does not depend , according to him , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buccal cavity also , and even of the lingual and faucal tube below , whence the possibility , already referred to , of producing it without the lips . Such a change in the form of the tube is to us quite unintelligible ; and we are distinctly conscious , when the lips are released from service in forming an o or oo , of a decided compensating action at the base of the tongue . We are not satisfied with the defined relations , internal or external , of the group of vowels of " mixed " position ( made by action both of front and back of tongue ) , variations , sometimes trivial or imaginary , of the " neutral " vowel , as it has beca commonly styled , and we can not consent to regard the open vowel a ( in far ) as " back low wide , " that is , as involving retraction of the back of the tongue toward the palate , to low degree only , with expanded organs behind the aperture . Whatever removal of the tongue from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of openness rather than of closure ; this vowel is only negatively characterized ; it is the natural utterance of the human throat when most expanded . Without pretending , therefore , to understand otherwise than imperfectly the intricacies of vowel formation , we are yet confident that Mr. Bell 's labors contribute nothing of importance to the general theory of vowels . The old pyramidal arrangement of them , with a ( in far ) at the apex , and i and u ( in pique and rule ) at the sides of the base , which he conceives himself to have outgrown and superseded , contains more and better truth than his trilinear scheme with its multiplications . His system affords no ground for a unitary arrangement of the alphabet , vowels and consonants together , in all their mutual relations as parts of a whole . His definitions of vowel and consonant are , taken by themselves , nearly unexceptionable . He says ( pp. 12 , 13 ) : " Ia forming consonants , the breath or voice is stopped or squeezed , with an effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some part , of the guttural or oral passage ; and in forming vowels , the breath or voice flows through similar but more open and fixed ' configurations , which merely shape or mould the breath , without impeding its emission , " - and to a like effect elsewhere , which is nearly equivalent to saying that the vowels are sounds of opener position , involving less // interference on the part of the mouth organs , than the consonants ; that in the one class the element of material , of tone , predominates ; in the other the element of form , of articulating action . But he leaves us to suppose that all vowels ( that is to say , all " primary " vowels ; though why they should be thought to differ in this respect from " wide " ones is not clear to us ) are equally akin with consonants ; while , in truth , a ( in far ) is at the furthest possible remove from them , while i and u ( in pique and rule ) are close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y and w . And he equally fails to apprehend clearly the great difference in the approach made by different classes of consonants to a vowel value . Hence he is unable to explain satisfactorily why and when certain consonnnts in English take on a vowel office ( as n and 1 in token and able ) , and gives us such an account of the matter as would imply the possibility of turning the word legs into a trisyllable by simply dwelling a little upon the initial land final s ( z ) . As a further consequence , the nature and structure of the syllable are obscure to him , and , when he comes to the subject of syllabication , he has nothing better to give us as fundamental principle than the arbitrary dictum that " the natural action of the organs of speech is always from close to open , or from consonants to vowels . " Considering that in all our actual speech we are constantly passing from open to close , as well as in the contrary direction , we may well ask what our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , is only the first part of each utterance natural ? Are we guilty of unnatural conduct in pronouncing up , end , arms , or , yet worse , strands , in which we shift direction twice both before and after the vowel ? What is " nature , " then , and what do we go by when we have abandoned her ? There are other classes of signs , forming important complementary parts of the general system ; to which we have not alluded , and which we can not undertake to describe . Such are the " glides , " vanishing sounds , transition steps between consonant and vowel , which do essential service in representing the niceties of pronunciation , either general or individual ; and a long series of " definers , " sparingly used in describing ordinary speech , but especially necessary in dealing with half-articulate or inarticulate utterances . So far , then , as regards the first of our three leading points of inquiry , - the completeness and accuracy of the phonetic analysis represented by it , - we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special merit ; indeed , we do not see that he has notably advanced in a single particular or scientific comprehension of the processes of utterance . And inasmuch as upon this mainly depends the " science of alphabetics , " we can not but think that Mr. Ellis , in pronouncing it the // first realization of that science , greatly exaggerates its value , and does signal injustice to the other eminent men who have labored in the same department , - only he is saved from any complaint on their part by having included himself in the same unjust condemnation . Mr. Bell 's deserts , such as they are , lie in the line of the art , rather than the science , of alphabetic notation . To assert this is , of course , to deny to the system that absolute and unique value which it arrogates to itself , and to class it with other schemes of the same character , more or less elaborate and ingenious . It does not stand sp alone as its author imagines , even as regards its fundamental principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which produce the sound signified . The distinguished physiologist and phonetist , Dr. Brucke of Vienna , has worked out a similar " Method of Phonetic Transcription , " * very different in aspect from Mr. Bell 's , as was naturally to be expected ; but essentially unlike it only in adopting a more arbitrary and less directly symbolical set of elementary signs , and in undertaking a less complete depiction of all the phenomena of utterance , articulate and inarticulate . In these respects , as well as in general clearness , legibility , and gratefulness to the eye , the English system seems to us to have the decided advantage of the German . As an instrumentality for rendering possible the exact reproduction of spoken speech , we presume thatits equal has never been devised ; perhaps its superior may never be devised . Mr. Bell 's experience as a professed elocutionist and trainer of the voice has come admirably to his aid in the construction of his alphabet . It may seem , at first glance , as if the acknowledged success of the experiments of reproduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis upon which it rests . But a moment 's consideration will show that the case is otherwise . For practical use it makes no difference whether a certain sign represents an exact phonetic analysis of the sound it signifies , or whether it stands conventionally for that sound . Mr. Bell places before our eyes , we will say , a scratch on paper which directs us to approximate the back and front of the tongue together toward the palate to a medium degree , to open the organs behind the configurative aperture , and to apply a rounding effect . Now who in the world ( in this world , where even the most practised phonologists are still disputing over the mode of production of vowel sounds ) is going to give him the sound he expects ? Not we , certainly ; we will not even undertake to find by means of the description the precise American pronunciation of the vowel of stone , which he finally gives us * To be found in the Proceedings of the Vienna Academy of Sciences , Vol . XLI. ( 1863 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original . Nor , we presume , would the young men whom he made use of in his experiments as readers have been more successful . If , however , he gives us the sound intended to be signified , we can reproduce that , at once or after sufficient practice ; and we can so associate it with the sign as to utter it whenever the sign is shc*wn us ; and equally well , whether we do or do not make the attempt to find out for ourselves that the sign has a right to stand for the sound , or even whether , having made the attempt , we conclude that it has or that it has not that right . And if we have learned in this way thirty-six vowel sounds with their attributed signs , we may safely set up as accurate pronouncers , word by word and phrase by phrase , of nearly all human languages , so far as the vowel part of them is concerned . In point of practical applicability , therefore ( the ground of our second leading inquiry ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physical analysis on which it professes to be founded . To a great extent , we say , but not wholly ; for it is easier to accept for a sound a wholly conventional sign than one which tries to describe it , and describes it falsely . Yet even here there are degrees ; while we might consent to use without scruple the prescribed character for the difficult vowel sound of stone , we could hardly prevail upon ourselves to write habitually for th a hieroglyph which asserted that both the front and point of the tongue are concerned in its production , and form a central closure with side emission . It is in such points as this that Mr. Bell 's alphabet , with all its merits , seems imperatively to call for amendment before it shall be entitled to general acceptance and currency . But even if amended into practical perfection , what is the degree and kind of currency which it can hope to gain ? Here we think Mr. Bell commits his most serious error , exaggerating beyond measure the sphere of usefulness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , has studied so thoroughly the mechanism of the voice , has traced the action and effect of every organ so clearly , that now , when he has hit upon a sign which brings each articulation plainly before his mifid , he thinks that it will do the same almost as readily for other minds . One of the unfortunate effects of this persuasion of his is to be seen in the form into which he has cast his published account of his alphabet , rendering it an exceedingly hard one to study , and doubtless driving away many a student who might otherwise have mastered the system , and been interested in its behalf . Instead of beginning with definition and illustration together , makingeach described position of the organs more readily apprehensible by noting the sound it yields , he fills the first two thirds of his volume with pure description and desig // nation , and only then begins to introduce the equivalents in our alphabet of the sounds intended . Even those who are accustomed to phonetic analysis are perplexed by such a course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or else to draw out tables of corresponding signs in the , old alphabet and the new , to help them read with intelligence and profit the opening chapters . In accordance with this is Mr. Bell 's conviction , that his analysis and alphabet , being now complete , every one hereafter is going to be able to read and pronounce everything with exactness . Thus , he says , for example ( p. 116 ) , after making the adaptation of his system to English speech : " Chiefly on account of ti3ese delicate and unascertained varieties of sound , the native pronunciation of English has been found excessively difficult for foreigners to master . It will no longer be so . " For , all we want is to know what the thing to be done is , and how it is to be done , and we can do it . This is a little too sanguine . So all the motions required for executing a difficult feat in skating can be described ; but woe to him who attempts to execute it from directions on paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skilful skater , and he will do upon the ice what he is told to do ; make him a phonologist , teach him to feel his organs of utterance at work , and to direct them in detail by conscious exertions of his will , and he will read , with success , from signs physically descriptive . What our author fails to appreciate is , that a system like his is essentially a scientific nomenclature , like a chemical or zodlogical nomefclature . It does not teach the science ; in learning it , one does not learn the science ; it is worth a great deal to him who knows the science , but little to a layman ; it may do not a little to clear up the relations of the scieuce , and make its acquisition easier ; yet , the science is the hard thing to learn , and the nomenclature only of secondary account . That the new . alphabet is going to help all the classes for whom Mr. Bell destines it we do not venture to hope . That the illiterate man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooner for haying added to his task that of observing how each sound he utters is produced , seems quite unreasonable . To him the symbolical signs will be useful only as any strictly phonetic orthography is easier than an irregular one , like ours . To expect that the missionary , armed with it , is to master , without difficulty , and write down , with exactness , the strange dialects with which he comes in contact , is equally unreasonable . The task of distinctly apprehending their unaccustomed sounds , of reproducing these correctly , of detecting the motions which originate them , will be as severe as ever ; and he who has accomplished it will find a far inferior difficulty in signifying them intelligibly . To the great mass of // July , readers there is , and can be , no advantage in a mode of writing , all whose signs are physically significant ; they must learn and use it as conventional only . Our own alphabet , modified to phonetic consistency , would suit their purposes equally well , - nay , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triumphantly as you will that laugh is an absurd orthography , and that it is much better to write Uif yet he goes on to spell laugh as before , and it will not help the matter to give him a new set of signs to write laf with . The fate of the various phonetic systems , probably , foreshadows that of Mr. Bell 's . There was no good reason for his speaking disparagingly of the labors of men like Lepsius , who , accepting as a portentous fact the immense existing prejudice in favor of familiar signs , have endeavored to work out of these something approaching to a phonetic system , - with the partial aim , moreover , of transliterating strange modes of writing as well as of speaking . Probably , he has been , by this time , disappointed by the unenthusiastic reception his discovery has met , and the little attention it has attracted . He will have to learn to be content with addressing chiefly those interested in phonetic science , instead of the great public ; with seeking the sympathy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under governmental authority , as something finished and immaculate , upon the community at large . Its claim to extraordinary support is not greater than that of any other new and improved scientific nomenclature ; and the condemnation which its author expects to see passed upon the Derby Cabinet , for neglect of so grand an opportunity , will , we presume , be indefinitely suspended . In its own proper sphere , and especially with a clearer and more apprehensible method of presentation , it may be relied on to do much good , attracting toward and facilitating phonetic studies , and perhaps contributing a chief part to that system ; not a theoretically perfect one , for the conditions of the case admit of none such , but a system more successfully compromised , more nicely adjusted , to the ascertained needs of the transcription of all languages than any other , which the future is to bring forth .
