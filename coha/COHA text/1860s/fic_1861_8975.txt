" There 's many a slip ' Twixt the cup and the lip . "  --  Old Saying . Main text ACT I. Scene 1 SCENE .  --  A parlor in the house of the lateCsar Girodot.  --  Furniture luxurious but old-fashioned .  --  A round table in C.  --  Side-boards practicable , R and L.  --  On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French window R. flat .  --  Fireplace R H 2 E , and clock and Candelabra .  --  Door L flat to exterior  --  Door L to Girodot 's bed room . Enter at door flat L , Felix and Massias . Felix . Felix Girodot Taking out his watch . You see , my friend , we are more than in hour before the appointed time for the reading of this will , and the consequent assemblage of the relatives of good Csar Girodot the testator , my worthy uncle . Massias . Mons. Massias Precisely as I wished , my dear Felix , that we may have a little uninterrupted conversation about our deceased friend , and the probable disposition of his large property , among a parcel of people who , although your relations , as well as his , I 'm sorry to say , I fancy will come more in joy than in grief , and depart only more in sorrow than in anger , if they get nothing by the will . Felix . Felix Girodot I must admit , my dear Massias , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature . Mass . Mons. Massias And yet , there are several among you whom I like very much ; first , yourself , notwithstanding your faults . Felix . Felix Girodot Bowing gravely . Thank you . Mass . Mons. Massias Smiling and pressing Felix 's hand . Then your charming daughter , Pauline ; then your cousin Hortense , who has only one fault in my eyes , that of being the wife of Mons. Lehuchoir ; lastly , Lucien de Rouvre , who , with your little Pauline , shared the especial love and favor of my old friend Csar . Felix . Felix Girodot Your partiality , I think , is well founded ; but what of the rest ; Lebuchoir , Langlumeau , Isidore , Clementine , Celestin ? Mass . Mons. Massias Very charming people , I dare say , but not to my taste . I could almost make exception in favor of Isidore , if I were convinced , as I half suspect , that he is only a mere visionary . Felix . Felix Girodot Ceriainly , the absurdity of some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently grasping after money but working as certainly and successfully in the opposite direction , as if to avoid the possibility of wealth were his sole end and aim . Mass . Mons. Massias And yet to think of his having married when he was such a young man , old Madam Clementine Jamart , because she was a connection of poor Csar 's , and so might get something at his death . Felix . Felix Girodot Ha ! ha ! ha ! Old enough to be his mother , and with a scamp of a son not many years younger than himself . Mass . Mons. Massias Laboring under the hallucination that the whole world is in a conspiracy to crush his prospects , and baulk his progress in life , he goes about like a very Quixot , with lance in rest , charging full tilt at friend and foe alike . Felix . Felix Girodot Csar Girodot , although very shrewd , was equally eccentric , and if in one of his strange humors he should have come to the conclusion , that Isidore was a genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bequeathed to him anything considerable , we may set ourselves down as so many windmills in his imagination , and expect to be ridden at , with all the fury of a giant refreshed . Mass . Mons. Massias Never fear ; I have better hopes for my favorities than to dread my old friend Csar 's eccentricity to that extent . Felix . Felix Girodot By the by , talking of your favorites , reminds me of Lucien , and that he should be here . Mass . Mons. Massias Does he not live in the country ? Felix . Felix Girodot He has been here in Paris for the last few days . He came into my laboratory this morning , and said he wished to speak to me before the reading of the will ; I had not time to talk to him then , so I made an appointment with him to be here early . Servant outside D. L. F. Servant . Servant This other door , sir , if you please . Mass . Mons. Massias And here he is , I 've no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isidore Girodot You 're an impertinent , insolent , contemptible  --  Felix and Massias express horror . Felix . Felix Girodot ' T is Isidore and Clementine ! Mass . Mons. Massias I 'm off ; they 're not prescribed yet ; I never take physic till I 'm compelled . Exeunt Massias and Felix L. 2 E. At the same moment Isidore appears at door L. flat , holding by it and speaking to Servant , who is outside . Isid . Isidore Girodot I say you are an importinent , insolent , presuming  --  Enters followed by Clementine . Clementine . Clementine Now , my dear , my love  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Slamming the door . Fool ! These servants are as unbearable as  --  as  --  as  --  Clem . Clementine Why , surely , my love , that one said nothing to you . Isid . Isidore Girodot He did everything but that  --  but that , I say . He looked at me ; and how ? with an air that said as plainly as if he had said it : ugh , ugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no carriage ! what a pity , such an elegant couple . That 's what he meant , and why ? because he knew perfectly well the moment I mentioned my name , that instead of being the head , the chief of my office , I 'm only a clerk , a poor divil of a  --  pugh !  --  beggarly clerk ! Clem . Clementine My dear , let us be resigned to our fate ; soon I hope it will be changed for the better : patience a little longer and then this will , which we are to hear read , will enrich us forever . Isid . Isidore Girodot Ah ! ha ! ha ! Oh , to be rich , that I may be revenged on all my persecutors who have tortured me so long . All , all will I humiliate in my turn . Humiliate ! trample in the dust like caterpillars ! Scraping his foot on ground . Clem . Clementine Caterpillars , my love ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Yes , madam , caterpillars ; do you , too , array @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clementine My love , you know I do n't , but I think it would be much more christianlike to pardon and even protect them . Isid . Isidore Girodot With disdain . Protect caterpillars ! Clem . Clementine No , no , my love , your enemies . Isid . Isidore Girodot Furiously . Well , madam , and what are they ? I 'll tell you : Slugs , Bugs , Worms , Wasps ! Clem . Clementine Make them feel a little . Isid . Isidore Girodot Feel ! aha ! A slug sigh ! a bug blush ! a worm weep ! Madam , I have seen a wasp cut in two , and while his sirloin , as I may say , was turning somersets for diversion , his head and shoulders immersed in a honey-pot , gorged themselves with others ' sweets without so much as a thought or care that there was not even a stomach for them to go to when they were swallowed . Oh , I 'll be revenged on all the world , all the world I say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the thought to defraud me of this wealth , will come , no doubt , all of ' em , to the reading of the will , in the hope of inheriting something themselves . And ah , who knows , they may be legatees as well as I. Oh , if they should  --  Seizes a chair and raises it violently . Clem . Clementine Stopping him . My love , my dear ! consider , do n't be rash . Isid . Isidore Girodot True , you 're right . Puts chair down gently , they may be- belong to us . Before we were married , when I thought you were rich . I prevented you from falling down stairs one day on the same principle . Clem . Clementine My love , you 're a brute . But allow me to remind you , my dear , that several months must elapse before we can touch whatever may be coming to us ; therefore , it would be very imprudent not to be amiable to our relatives , to brother Felix , for instance , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isidore Girodot Be amiable to him ? What for ? do you not see that already he is only too maliciously happy to crush us with his benefits . Throwing himself into an arm chair . Clem . Clementine Let us be resigned to accept them , and let heaven punish his cruel intentions . Isid . Isidore Girodot How mighty comfortable this arm chair is . It is to be hoped that Csar has left us his furniture . Clem . Clementine It is a little old and worn , and shaky in the legs , but  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Looking at legs of chair . But in very fair condition ; things do n't last forever ; your legs ai n't what they were twenty years ago . Clem . Clementine Utters a little scream . Wretch ! how dare you  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot If they were they 'd never have condescended to walk up to the altar with me . Bowing , but making a grimmace aside . Clem . Clementine Simpering . Oh how sweet ! what a darling it is . Approaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turning to mantelpiece . This clock 's magnificent . Clem . Clementine Worth at least five hundred francs . Isid . Isidore Girodot And the candelabra , how heavy they are ; Uncle Csar denied himself nothing , while I , his nephew  --  Clem . Clementine Examining the furniture . What can you expect , my dear ? Your uncle was an old bachelor , and old bachelors  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Yes , yes , I know , they have every advantage ; in the first place , that of not being married . Clem . Clementine Since we are here by ourselves , had n't we better take a peep into the sideboards and see the exact amount ; it is our right , for we are natural heirs . Isid . Isidore Girodot It is , certainly as well that we see whether the servants have stolen anything . Opening sideboard L. and rumaging . Clem . Clementine At the other sideboard , R. We were very wrong do you know , in not putting seals on them . Isid . Isidore Girodot Laying his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sideboard . No end of silver spoons here ; but there 's one missing , for I bit a big dent in one the last time I eat here , and I do n't see it . Clem . Clementine Oh , my dear , that 's not the only spoon in the house that 's been bitten , you may depend on it . Isid . Isidore Girodot Thank you . I 'm quite aware of it  --  curs 'd indelicate in you , though to remind me of it . Clem . Clementine Haughtily , and turning on him with a large soup ladle in her hand . Sir ! Isid . Isidore Girodot Because I ca n't afford to make the set complete before I present them to you . Clem . Clementine Simpering . Oh , the dear , generous  --  She approaches as if to kiss him . Isid . Isidore Girodot Having taken a folded table-cloth from sideboard , holds it up so that it unfolds between his face and Clementine . Oh ! here 's a splendid table-cloth ! Clem . Clementine Monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over his face . At the same moment , Felix and Massias enter at door L. 2 . E. laughing . Mass . Mons. Massias Madam , your most obedient  --  shall I ring for the soup ? Felix . Felix Girodot No , no , you do n't give my dear brother time to lay the cloth . Isidore and Clementine much confused . Clem . Clementine He , he , he ! we were wondering whether our wealthy uncle  --  Mass . Mons. Massias Was born with a silver soup ladle in his mouth instead of a teaspoon . Clementine goes up to sideboard and puts down ladle . Isid . Isidore Girodot To Felix ; angrily fumbling with the cloth . Sir , do you suppose  --  The fact is , I had laid my handkerchief accidentally on the sideboard , and took up this thing in mistake for it . Throws cloth on sideboard and takes up his handkerchief and shows it . Massias and Felix go up laughing aside Isidore and Clementine meet C. Isid . Isidore Girodot This is pleasant : in the presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who mocks and insults us . Clem . Clementine How comes he to be here ? he does not belong to the family . Isid . Isidore Girodot Suppose by chance he should have a legacy ! Clem . Clementine It 's very possible ; a souvenir perhaps . Isid . Isidore Girodot I 'll invite him to dinner , and give him nothing but underdone pork and green damsons . Massias and Felix come down R. Mass . Mons. Massias You have not finished your inspection , my good friends ? the other rooms are equally well ladled and table-cloth 'd in one way or another ; pray do n't let our presence hinder you ; go , I beg . Isid . Isidore Girodot Indignantly . Sir , I  --  Clem . Clementine Aside to Isidore . Hush , my dear , he wo n't come to dinner . Assuming great politeness to Massias . Sir , we are too happy to see on a day like this , the best friend of our uncle , not to desire to remain with him . Mass . Mons. Massias Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girodot Yes , we shall all meet together very shortly . Isid . Isidore Girodot Bitterly . Is it so ? you , too , wish to get rid of us . Oh say so , say so at once , we are in the way . Ha ! ha ! ha ! and it 's not the first time . Felix . Felix Girodot My dear brother !  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Yes , yes , I know what I say ; no longer ago than yesterday you gave us the cut Felix . Felix Girodot I ! the cut ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Certainly , you gave a grand dinner , and did not invite us . Mass . Mons. Massias Why , I thought you said he gave you the cut . Isid . Isidore Girodot So I did , but not a cut at his mutton . No. no , he left us at home to bore ourselves . Clem . Clementine My dear !  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Yes , I repeat it , to bore ourselves . Is that the way that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Isidore , they were all professional men , and I simply did not ask you because my table was not big enough . Clem . Clementine Affected . Oh ! you could have added another leaf . Isid . Isidore Girodot Leaf ! two leaves , why not ? Mass . Mons. Massias And pushed back the walls of the dining-room . Isid . Isidore Girodot Forgetting . Of course , and pushed back  --  Stopping himself . Sir , do you mean  --  Mass . Mons. Massias Nothing . Offering snuff-box . Do you snuff ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Takes pinch and is about to throw it away when Clementine signs to him as to accept it . Thank you . Clem . Clementine Aside . Think of the pork and plums . Isid . Isidore Girodot Right Puts snuff to his nose and sneezes . Damn his snuff  --  come a  --  snezze  --  long . Mass . Mons. Massias There 's a Murillo in the next room , Mr. Isidore , you are a connoiseur I believe , you 'll find the frame is very beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fr  --  sneeze ame ! Sir , I 'd have you know  --  Using his handkerchief . Mass . Mons. Massias Pointing to table-cloth . Can I offer you a larger bandkerchief ? Isidore is furious . Clem . Clementine Getting between Isidore and Massias , and making the latter a profound reverence . Many thanks , dear sir , for all your extreme politeness . Isid . Isidore Girodot Aside and pulling her . Oh , con  --  con  --  found your po  --  po  --  po sneeze liteness . Clementine courtseys as Isidore pulls and pushes her to door L. 2 E. he sneezing pushes her off . Damn the snuff ! Exit door L. 2 . Massias and Felix laugh Felix . Felix Girodot Ha ! ha ! ha ! You are a little too severe , my dear Massias , the continual restraint they live in has made them  --  Mass . Mons. Massias Never mind any more about those stupid people ; here 's one whose society we may be glad of . Enter Lucien , D. L. flat . Lucien . Lucien Shaking hands with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massias , are you well ? Mass . Mons. Massias Perfectly . I 've buried my poor Csar , I shall outlive you all . Lucien . Lucien I trust so . Mass . Mons. Massias You wish to speak to Felix . I 'll go into the next room and see that Mr. Isidore do n't mistake any more table-cloths for handkerchiefs . Lucien . Lucien Stay , I pray you , you can hear what I have to say to my cousin , and if he is embarrassed at answering me  --  Mass . Mons. Massias Oh , do n't fear , he 'll not be . Felix . Felix Girodot But is the matter so grave , Lucien , that you have to ask me ? Lucien . Lucien So grave , that on it depends the happiness of my whole life ; it is a question which concerns in the highest degree , the person you love most in the world , your daughter . Felix . Felix Girodot My daughter ? Lucien . Lucien My cousin Pauline , who I love , and whose hand I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we there ? Goes and seats himself in arm chair by fireplace and takes newspaper . Felix . Felix Girodot You love Pauline ? Luc Lucien Yes , since the last visit I made to Paris , when I found a charming young girl . whom I had left a little child ; when I recognized an accomplished woman in her whom I had regarded until then only as my little cousin . Felix . Felix Girodot But how is it that you have buried yourself in the country , and no one has heard of you for these three or four months ? Lucien . Lucien For a long time I believed myself incapable of ever again loving , therefore I did not give way to the sentiment I felt , but soon I found myself obliged to admit that my heart was touched by the graces of your lovely daughter , by her goodness , the attachment she shows for you . I tried to lay the remembrance aside , but found it impossible . Then I returned to Paris , and here find all that I have so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now she has improved in everything ; I have become more and more enamored and have come to-day to tell you that which you how know . Felix . Felix Girodot And does Pauline know it ? Lucien . Lucien Oh , I have said nothing to Pauline , nor done anything to make her think so ; she may suspect it , perhaps , but I have done nothing to make her believe it . Felix . Felix Girodot And does she love you ? Lucien . Lucien I know not , I had not the courage to ask her  --  well , cousin , what encouragement can you give me ? Felix . Felix Girodot Why , my dear fellow , I am delighted yes , truly delighted , because I like you very much and prize you highly ; but , as you must yourself understand , anything as grave and serious as this , demands reflection , examination , time ; is it not so , Mr. Massias ? Mass . Mons. Massias Without doubt , certainly , take your time ; it is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is almost as difficult as to say no . Lucien . Lucien To Felix . But do you see any obstacle to this marriage ? Felix . Felix Girodot No , no , not positively ; at least I do n't think so . Lucien . Lucien And you , Mr. Massias ? Mass . Mons. Massias I ? since you consult me , I would ask you one simple question . Rises and comes down . Why do you make this demand here , and on this morning ? Felix . Felix Girodot Yes , answer Mr. Massias that , my friend . Lucien . Lucien I make it here , because my uncle Csar loved pauline and me very much , and I feel myself somehow under his protection in this room , which he occupied so long . I make it at this moment , because before the end of this day the will of our uncle will be read , and if pauline should be best provided for , I do not wish then to tell you I love her , to appear as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix Girodot This precaution was not necessary ; I always looked upon you as a man of honor , Lucien . Lucien . Lucien Well , what now , cousin ? Felix . Felix Girodot I see many difficulties my friend . Pauline is young , I did not intend her to marry so soon , I have not reflected enough . Mass . Mons. Massias You must reflect , of course ; he can not expect you to decide in a moment . But pardon , my dear Lucien , one observation for the interest of her you love . For two years you lived in Paris , seeming to like the world and society very much ; suddenly you announced to us , that the world and Paris had become odions to you , and that you were going to pass the remainder of your life in the country in the shade of the beech tree ; I add the beech tree , perhaps , but however , you said the country . We accepted , like reasonable people , the motives you then thought proper to give for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask the hand of a young girl , we have the right to be more inquisitive . Felix . Felix Girodot Massias is right . Lucien . Lucien I will not deny it  --  but  --  Mass . Mons. Massias You are perplexed at answering ; I will help you . Was not your sudden aversion for Paris , inspired by a violent and unhappy attachment ? Lucien . Lucien Yes . Mass . Mons. Massias That you conceived for a married woman ? Lucien . Lucien I avow it . Mass . Mons. Massias In your visits to Paris have you ever again seen her ? Lucien . Lucien No . Mass . Mons. Massias By and by , when you will see her enter , for she can not fail to attend this family reunion  --  Lucien . Lucien What ! you know that Hortense is the  --  have you divined ?  --  Mass . Mons. Massias What would one do at my age if not divine the secrets of others . But come , are you quite sure that at the sight of her you will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am certain . Mass . Mons. Massias We shall see that . To Felix . It is your turn now ; do any new difficulties arise , if not , you must decide . Felix . Felix Girodot But it is important  --  I have no dowry to give my daughter , and Lucien has neither fortune nor position to live in Paris , nor anywhere else , with a wife and children . Mass . Mons. Massias Do you forget the will ? Felix . Felix Girodot Ah ! then let us wait . Mass . Mons. Massias That 's it ; let us wait . Declare now that you are glad you have the right to make an answer like that To Lucien , and you be happy to get it . Langlumeau outside , D. F. Langlumeau . Langlumeau Has the Notary arrived yet ? Mass . Mons. Massias At last these dear heirs ! If Csar could only be here ; but they are quite certain that he will not be here . Enter Langlumeau , D. F. L. Langlu . Langlumeau Gentlemen , He salutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salute . I declare there are no ladies ! I present you my respects . Mass . Mons. Massias My dear Mr. Langlumeau , have you consented to tear yourself from the charms of Pontivy ? Langlu . Langlumeau Ah , it has greatly disarranged my plans , for we were just preparing to get in our hay  --  if this affair could have possibly come off in winter  --  Mass . Mons. Massias You 're right . I do n't see how any one can die in summer ; it is a piece of great egotism . Langlu . Langlumeau Simply . Oh , yes . To Felix . How , Mr. Girodot , you have not brought your daughter . Felix . Felix Girodot She is coming with her cousin Hortense . Clementine enters door L. 2 E. Langlu . Langlumeau Perceiving Clementine . Ah , here are the ladies . Goes to Clementine . Dear cousin . In a deep voice , our poor cousin ! when I think that it is only one year , one little year since I dined with him . Clem . Clementine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was helped three times to lobster ! Clem . Clementine Going up . Lucien follows and consoles her . There are blows that nothing can console . Langlu . Langlumeau Poor Csar ! what a wine cellar he had ! every wine of the first stamp . Ah ! I 'm only a peasant , a Briton of Pontivy , but I bless the memory of such a relative . I have a heart you see , that 's it , a heart , a heart . Mass . Mons. Massias And a stomach . Langlu . Langlumeau And a stomach . They laugh . Hey ! Taking Massias aside . Tell me , Mr. Massias , poor Csar 's farm of Clousicq , which is inclosed in my lands , do you think in his will he has remembered  --  They talk apart . Clem . Clementine Down with Lucien . Ah , do n't worry yourself , do n't despond ; you shall come and see us whenever you can . You need not be ceremonious with Isidore and me , we 're not proud . Langlu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that dear Isidore , my charming cousin ? Clem . Clementine He is there Points L. D. 2 , in Csar 's room . Langlu . Langlumeau In great alarm . What , all alone ? Clem . Clementine Yes , he is big enough , I hope . Stopping Langlumeau who runs to room L. Eh ! Well , where are you going to ? Langlu . Langlumeau I 'm going to shake hands with him . Exit door L. 2 E. Mass . Mons. Massias Aside . He knows the sideboards are open . Pauline . Pauline outside . My father ought to be here . Hortense . Hortense outside . Do you think so ? Felix . Felix Girodot I recognize the voices of my daughter and Hortense . Mass . Mons. Massias Low to Lucien . The past and the future . Enter Pauline and Hortense . Hor . Hortense Aside , with emotion . Lucien ! Pauline . Pauline Who runs to her father . Good day , Lucien , good day , Mr. Massias . Mass . Mons. Massias Good day , good day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouting . Little girl ! fie ! you naughty man . Goes to Clementine and embraces her . Clem . Clementine They always embrace me last . Lucien . Lucien To Hortense . It is a long time since I have had the pleasure of seeing you , my cousin , will you not give me your hand ? Hortense gives him her hand . Felix . Felix Girodot To Massias . How moved she is . Mass . Mons. Massias To Felix . But he is perfectly calm . Clem . Clementine Advancing to Hortense . What is the matter with you , my dear ? you are very pale . Hor . Hortense I ! nothing  --  nothing at all . Clem . Clementine Aside . Aha ! I have divined that sort of nothing before now . Pauline . Pauline Running to Hortense , who appears faint . My sweet cousin , you are ill . Hor . Hortense No , no , it is nothing . Lucien . Lucien To Massias . Well ? Mass . Mons. Massias You are cured , but she is not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as 1st Act . At rise of curtain , Isidore enters with Clementine , a la Romeo and Juliet , and walk to and fro . Isid . Isidore Girodot Wife , wife , the wiles and villainies of the world increase around us , and thus , only thus , can we henceforth combat them . Clem . Clementine Simpering . Oh , how nice ! Isidore stopping and looking hard in her face , then deliberately dropping her hand , removing his arm from her waist and moving off . Clem . Clementine My love , why do you  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot I was mistaken , we ca n't combat anything if we 're tied up in a knot . Clem . Clementine Ough ! Sighing violently . Isid . Isidore Girodot But we must act in unison of mind and purpose . You have received a fresh stab from one of these relations ; so have I. Think of it ! the purse-proud Felix , gathering from some incautious remarks I made on my financial condition , patronizingly intimated that I might take comfort , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despond ; a thousand or two francs , said he , is nothing between brothers ; do you mark the malice of that ? Where will their insults stop ? I actually expected every minute to see him take out the money and hand it to me ! Oh , if he had ! Clem . Clementine You would not have been rash , love ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Rash ! I would have  --  Clem . Clementine Done as I did . Isid . Isidore Girodot As you did ? explain . Clem . Clementine Ah , I have had my trials too , but I have also had revenge . Isid . Isidore Girodot Revenge ! instruct me . Clem . Clementine I ventured a remark to the purse-proud Hortense , on the character and color of her dress , which I intimated was not mourning . She condescended to correct my ignorance on that point , and then then told me that she had just seen a most superb silk which she thought would be most becoming to me . With pointed humility I expressed my inability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! she said she had bought it and begged permission to present to me . Isid . Isidore Girodot With mock grief . My wife ! my poor wife ! Embraces Clementine . Clem . Clementine Is not that enough ? Isid . Isidore Girodot How many yards ? Clem . Clementine Vexed . Humiliation ! Isid . Isidore Girodot Distracting ! ah , too much , too much ! Clem . Clementine Not for flounces , ca n't do with less than sixteen . Isid . Isidore Girodot And she owned to sixteen ? Clem . Clementine And suggested the flounces . Isid . Isidore Girodot Embracing her as before . My patient sufferer ! and your revenge . Clem . Clementine To make my pretended humility the more cutting , I  --  Isid . Isidore Girodot Anxiously . Yes , yes , yes , you  --  Clem . Clementine Accepted it ! Isid . Isidore Girodot Come to my arms again . They embrace. you are equal to any indignity . Clem .

The rent 's due tomorrow . All are here who are interested in the will , except your son Celestin ; you must make him acquainted with our stratagem , our pretended  --  Heaven fortify me !  --  humility to the tyrant Felix . Urge on your son to keep his infernal swaggering and assumption of wealth in the back ground at least for an hour , till I 've either accomplished the loan or bagged the inheritance . Clem . Clementine Leave the dear boy to me , love . It is only you I fear . Alas , how will you endure these people 's airs ; the grand and domineering manner of that rich rhinoceros , Lehuchoir , the husband of Hortense ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Starting . Ah ! but  --  no , no , no ! I 'll bide my time till this vast wealth is mine , and then I 'll bear  --  yes , yes , bear down on this Lehuchoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Clem .

Isidore Girodot Ah , they come ! Be still , my outraged pride . To Clementine . And you keep quiet , for heaven 's sake . Notary and all the party enter except Celestin and Lehuchoir . Felix . Felix Girodot Now , are we all assembled ? No , I miss Mons. Lehuchoir , and your son , madam , Mons. Celestin Jamart . Clem . Clementine Bless me , I 'm sure he 's here somewhere . Isid . Isidore Girodot Hush ! His absence is of no consequence , Mr. Notary , he is fully represented here . Clem . Clementine Aside . My love , you forget . Isid . Isidore Girodot Very politely . Pray proceed sir , we would not delay you for the world . Felix . Felix Girodot Oh , here comes Mons. Lehuchoir , just in time . Enter Lehuchoir . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir As he enters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to know ? Mr. Notary , you have made us dance attendance prettily on you . Isid . Isidore Girodot I do n't know that any one has been dancing . Lehu .

Go on , Mr. Notary , do n't make the gentleman dance any more , it will fatigue him . Lehu . Mons.

Come , that would be very droll . I have entertained all these people , who are nothing to me , who weary me , contemn and despise me . I have stripped for them my fruit trees , poured out the best of my wine , do you think I did all this to please their beautiful eyes ? No ! My prodigality , which has made Mr. Isidore shrug his shoulders , must bring me something in return . Hor . Hortense Something like a million , perhaps . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Yes , a million , or a million and a half . I suppose I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mons. Lehuchoir May I ask why , if you please ? Hor . Hortense You have often enough desired me never to mix myself in your affairs . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir But this , to-day , is as much your affair as it is mine . Hor . Hortense I do not think so ; are you not rich enough ? what would you do with this new fortune ? Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Confidentially . I would buy the Palace of Industry . Hor . Hortense For what purpose ? Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir To make a tenement house for mechanics . I 'll divide it into five hundred dear little lodgings . Hor . Hortense Which you will rent very dear to the poor mechanics . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Why , as dear as possible , of course . Why do you sneer at me ? I do not blush for the trade that enriched me , and permits you to live in luxury , my dear , be good enough not to forget that . Come , Hortense , be reasonable : listen to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to vote . Retaining Hortense , who is rising . Stop a moment ! listen ! Of course , we can not make allies of the Girodots , they will vote for themselves and no one else . As to Felix , he will promise us his vote to-day , and will give it to his brother to-morrow . He do n't know how to refuse any one ; there only remains Langlumeanu and Lucien ; Langlumeau I will take charge of ; as to Lucien , you are good friends , you can easily manage him . Hor . Hortense I , monsieur ? Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Certainly ! What astonishes you so ? You know wonderfully well how to amuse that young gentleman : fine speeches , romantic style , grand sentiments . I wo n't hear a word of it , I assure you . Hor . Hortense The fact is  --  Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir You have come to yourself after all . That 's right ! Now , to the task , my love . Hor . Hortense Rising . Sir , I have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in these intrigues , and above all , where Lucien is the object . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Why he above all ? Hor . Hortense Because  --  because  --  Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Come , come , my dear , be a little generous . Hor . Hortense Walking up and down before him . It is impossible , I tell you . Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir Impossible ! impossible for you to aid me in obtaining a fortune that belongs to me ! for when I married you , you had an insignificant portion ; quite insignificant , and if I did consent to be content with it , it was because I believed that the fortune left by your uncle Csar , would not fail to fall to me . Now you want me to let it pass . No , no ! I am no such fool , and you may depend on it that your family shall never have it to say , " she rules over him . " Hor . Hortense What a man , and for life ! Lehu . Mons. Lehuchoir You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me from being as worthy as these people here . My own good sense has already brought me more money than their whole spirit will ever bring them . I knew how to become rich , while they are , and ever will be , dying of hunger . Ah , well ! What can you find to answer that ? Hortense goes up to back L. H. and listens no longer . I have gone too far . That is if  --  Come , my little dove . Forgive me if I was a little angry . He goes to kiss her hand . She draws it away , and returns and sits where she was at first . Forgive it ! you understand . That which I desire of you is very simple , very just . I will go and send your cousin Lucien to you ; speak to him gently . Aside and rubbing his hands . I shall have the Palace of Industry yet Exit Hor . Hortense Ah ! how cruel , how unworthy , when I have evaded even speaking to him . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Lucien , if you only knew ! I have been almost tempted to tell you , but no ! he would take no notice of it . Lucien . Lucien Who approaches Hortense . You appear agitated , my cousin , what is the matter ? Hor . Hortense Nothing , or , rather yes . Another scene , a ridiculous scene . Lucien , you are my friend , tell me you remain so , at least be so at this momoment . Sits on sofa L. Come , sit beside me . Lucien remains standing near her . Why do I not see you oftener ? Why do you always try to avoid me ? This is the first time in a year you have been to see me ; that is cruel ; I am not happy , and I have need from time to time to grasp the hand of a friend . Lucien gives his hand . Yes , it is a very long time since we have been together alone . Lucien . Lucien Is it not your fault , Hortense ? Hor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nevertheless , I have not absolutely forbidden you to see me . Lucien . Lucien No , not absolutely ? Remember the past ! I was in your house , in the country , as I am to-day ; you were charming as you are now ; I committed the fault of telling you I loved you , of making an explicit and passionate declaration . No one could have mistaken it , everything confirmed it  --  tearful eyes , trembling voice , agitated gestures ; it was the true declaration of an impulsive collegian ! Hor . Hortense I implore you ! Lucien . Lucien After having quietly listened to me , and just at the moment I began to feel some hope , you coldly answered me , that my love was not returned , and that I must absolutely forget you , or , at least , suppress for the future , those useless and too disorderly declarations . I replied , like all men when in love , that I could not prevent them from recommencing every time I saw you ; " then see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , " I entreated ; you smiled on me , a look that went direct to my heart , but which has since proved to me all your sagacity , for I never saw you again , and I am not dead . Hor . Hortense You see now , you did not love me as much as you said . Lucien . Lucien I loved you very dearly . Hor . Hortense Truly ? Lucien . Lucien Truly . Hor . Hortense Poor friend , forgive me , for you must have suffered much . Lucien . Lucien Yes , but I did not see you again . Hor . Hortense That is to say , you no longer loved me . Lucien . Lucien Love so serious and so unhappy as mine , must either diminish in violence , or carry me away , and we are here to establish the truth of my existence . Hor . Hortense Why speak so lightly , my friend , of a sentiment always respectable when it is true ? Lucien . Lucien Frankly , I permit myself to laugh to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hortense I never mocked it ; I did only that which it was proper I should do . Listen ! She rises and comes down stage . A young girl leaves her mother who has brought her up piously , who has filled her mind with thoughts of virtue , faith and conjugal fidelity ; she becomes a wife , she marries a man she does not yet love , but whom she thinks she can love . Time passes on , still she is not entirely happy , one corner of the vail that hides until then the defects of her husband has fallen ; a young man in love with her , appears ; he pleases her , he is agreeable , but still part of the vail protects the husband , and she sacrifices to duty to propriety , the happiness she imperfectly sees before her . Lucien . Lucien But the moment will arrive , when the vail you speak of will fall entirely . Hor . Hortense Oh , yes . Lucien . Lucien And then  --  Hor . Hortense Walking the stage . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired , could she go back to the time past , would she again act as she has acted ? Lucien . Lucien What matters interrogating the past ? it is the future that must be known . Hor . Hortense The future ? the future of whom ? Lucien . Lucien Of the man who was in love with her . Hor . Hortense Who was , but is no longer . Lucien . Lucien The man who was , and still is in love with her . Hor . Hortense Was , and still is ! Can those two words be united ? No , you are a proof of that . Lucien . Lucien I ? Hor . Hortense Since you love her no longer , did you not say so ? Lucien . Lucien I did say so . Hor . Hortense And did you say truly ? Lucien . Lucien After a moment 's hesitation . Yes . Hor . Hortense Ah ! thanks for that which has removed all my doubts . For an instant you appeared to me , by your position , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still  --  Lucien . Lucien Love you ? No , Hortense ! I will confess that it is not with impunity that I find myself alone at your side , after so long a separation ; all our past has returned to me , and filled my heart with agitation ; but this moment of trouble will cease , and now , my cousin , I will use the only language worthy of you and of me : No ! I do no longer love you . Of my past passion nothing remains but the souvenir ; as the ashes of a grate recall the fire that has burned there , the fire is never relit with the cinders . Hor . Hortense It is well , I thank you for your frankness . Lucien . Lucien But  --  Hor . Hortense Moving to the R. H. Some one is here . Enter Clementine . Clem . Clementine Who advances quickly and stops . Oh ! I disturb you ! Hor . Hortense Going to her . Come here , my dear Clementine , come here . Clem . Clementine Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupt your little tt a tete for the world ; in the country , and in one 's own house , it is but right that one should enjoy one 's liberty . Hor . Hortense You do not interrupt us at all . Makes Clementine pass before her and sit down . Clem . Clementine Sitting . Well , I will install myself , since you insist upon it , but , I am sure you do not want me here , either of you . Hor . Hortense Why not , cousin ? Clem . Clementine I thought to find my husband and son here , have you not seen them ? Hor . Hortense No . Lucien . Lucien If you wish to speak to them , I will go and find them . Clem . Clementine No , no . I have nothing to say to them , only I do not wish Isidore and Celestin to stay too long exposed to the strong air ; do n't laugh , my dear cousin , I am a wonian whose husband and son are all the world to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hortense Very just ; Lucien , go and say for Clementine , to Isidore and Celestin , that they are wanted here . Lucien exit at back , R. H. Clem . Clementine Dear , now , poor Lucien ! really to send him away from you thus , it is too bad ; but it is very true that that which makes the happiness of some makes the misery of others . Down stairs , on his way , he will meet that dear little Pauline , who is all alone , and who will be very happy to see him . Hor . Hortense Why does not Celestin keep company with Pauline ? Clem . Clementine Because , my dear , a young man who keeps company with a young girl , must necessarily pay her court , and my Celestin is too well brought up to walk in the footsteps of others . Hor . Hortense Others ? what others ? Clem . Clementine Oh ! I thought you knew ; pardon me , true , he would not tell you . Hor . Hortense Approaching Clementine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , do n't insist ; without deriding them I understand all these failings ; I am indulgent and fear to give you pain . Hor . Hortense Give me pain ? Excuse me , my dear Clementine , I can not guess riddles . I shall be obliged to you to explain this to me . Clem . Clementine Rising , goes up R. H , If you get angry , I shall be very sorry , but I implore , if he does not wish it known I should be truly grieved  --  A man can pay great attention to a young girl , and still have a great deal of affection for another person  --  I dare say Pauline does not much wish to have him ; only a couple of years ago she was but a baby , while you and he , that dear Lucien  --  really he is a charming fellow ! Hor . Hortense Oh ! is it of Lucien you are speaking ? Clem . Clementine Without doubt . Hor . Hortense And does he love Pauline ? Clem . Clementine I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do say it if it be true ; how can that affect me ? I do not understand any of your riddles ; Lucien loves Pauline ; will he marry her ? Clem . Clementine Oh , as to that I am ignorant ; it has never been mentioned before me . Hor . Hortense But how do you know he loves her ? Clem . Clementine My dear , I have too much interest in all my relations , not to know everything that concerns them . Then you know , my dear Hortense , at my age , when the tender passions agitate us no more , we must live to aid those of others ; when we can no longer dance , we look at the dancers . Eh ! bless me , I do believe we are going to have a dance in the garden ; a waltz , I verily think , for , as sure as can be , that 's Lucien with his arm round Pauline 's waist . Looking off . Hortense , who is looking the other way , turns quickly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Pauline ! Excuse , pray excuse my leaving , you , I have some orders to give . Hurries off agitated . Clem . Clementine Laughing immoderately and fanning herself ; then court-seying with mock gravity , Oh ! madam ! your most obedient , very humble servant ! Aha ! are you there my fine lady ? At this moment Massias enters opposite to her , as she courtseys . As she raises her head , she sees him , utters a scream , and runs off . Massias standing in astonishment as the act DROP FALLS .

Isidore Girodot That 's right , they fly from us also , fiddlers and all ; the moment we arrive anywhere that moment everybody decamps ; they treat us as a pestilence .

They will not be grand ftes then , papa . Isid . Isidore Girodot Silence ! when I speak ! Celes . Celestin Jamart Sir ! Isid . Isidore Girodot Remember the respect you owe me . Would you , for instance , that I should invite Mr. Lehuchoir , who overwhelms us with his impertinent luxury ? Clem . Clementine You should pardon such people , my dear , in expiation of your own sins . Isid . Isidore Girodot My sins ! my sins ! Speak for your  --  Clem . Clementine At any rate , before projecting anything it is important to be rich , and to be rich , you must inherit . Isid . Isidore Girodot We will inherit . Have we not our voices , and those of Felix and Pauline ? Clem . Clementine Are you quite sure of your brother and your niece ? Isid . Isidore Girodot Whom else would they vote for ? Celes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girodot For themselves ? They 'd never dare ! Clem . Clementine Nevertheless , my dear , it would be much safer to interest them in our success . Isid . Isidore Girodot But how is that to be done ? Clem . Clementine In the manner that I have already counselled . Demand of Felix the hand of his daughter for Celestin . Celes . Celestin Jamart Approaching . Sir ! Isid . Isidore Girodot But you do not reflect ; if we inherit , Celestin will become the son of a millionaire , and would you have him marry the daughter of a mere chemist ? Ah ! pooh ! pooh ! Passes to extreme L. and sits on chair . Clem . Clementine But , my dear , if the inheritance depends on this union , it would not be so bad a thing to do ; then , once that we have inherited , it will be time enough  --  Isid .

Isidore Girodot What difference does that make ? Celes . Celestin Jamart It appears to me to make a great deal , for that love must , one day , end in marriage ; do you not think so , mother ? Clem . Clementine I have doubted it for the last few moments . Celes . Celestin Jamart Ah ! Clem . Clementine Yes , just now , very innocently , and without thinking , I spoke of this love to Hortense , who appeared very much disturbed . Celes . Celestin Jamart Oh ! hang it msmma  --  Clem . Clementine My dear boy , do n't misunderstand me ; I should be very sorry if any one were to suspect the least thing of my cousin , a married woman , but it may happen that my clumsiness will put her at variance with Lucien , ( which would give him one voice less , ) and that she will try to prevent his marriage with Pauline . That is why I tell you , Isidore , to address our demand continually to your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he will not dare to refuse us , we will await the events . Celes . Celestin Jamart Yes , but look here ! Do you absolutely desire me to marry ? I do n't love Pauline . Clem . Clementine My child , you will love her ! she is charming , and in the meantime you love your father and mother , and you should make some sacrifice for them . Go and find Felix and Pauline , tell them we are here , and if you are too timid to hear us speak of this marriage before you , do not return . Isid . Isidore Girodot Rising . That 's it ! do n't return . Celes . Celestin Jamart Sir ? Oh , make your minds easy on that ; I wo n't ! Exit at back . Clem . Clementine To Isidore . My dear , if you will permit me , I will propose the subject of this marriage . Isid . Isidore Girodot Why , am I not head of my family ? Clem . Clementine Certainly , and I bow before your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you that you are of rather hot blood , you sometimes get angry , and  --  Isid .

Felix sits on garden seat to the L. holding Pauline 's hands in his , who remains standing near him .

Pauline I thought my cousin never occupied himself with any one but himself . Clem . Clementine Oh ! how can you say that ?

Felix Girodot What sentiments do you speak of , my dear sister ? Clem . Clementine What , have you not divined ? Why , brother , Celestin loves Pauline . Felix . Felix Girodot I believe he does .

I am only an employee , but we are both sons of Antoine Girodot and Amenaide Rabaillard his wife , we have then the same origin ; we are two branches coming from the same trunk .

Celestin Jamart Because you would have had to make sacrifices to obtain the most voices , and you never could agree to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and son should have at least remained to me , had they done their duty . Celes . Celestin Jamart It was very imprudent , I had almost said green , to count on uncle Felix ; he is too undecided to take a part , and so he put a blank vote in the urn . Isid .

Isidore Girodot And do you suppose I will ever consent that a son shall hold the purse strings of his father ? Celes . Celestin Jamart Why not ? if he knows how to untie them propos . Isid . Isidore Girodot Never ! these 150,000 francs must be given to me ; if they refuse , I shall have recourse to law ; I shall make you declare yourself incapable of managing your affairs ; the law protects the fathers of families .

You had none of the " natural shocks that flesh is heir to , " measles , croup , whooping cough , ring worm , scarlet , both ina and fever , and yet you always had twice the flesh that I had The cutting of your teeth was no more than the cutting of your hair , while every one of mine came near cutting short my existence . Every one caressed you for having nothing the matter with you ; I had every conceivable ailment in its worst form , and was never pitied , but by the small-pox . Felix .

Accused by your cousin of mean thoughts , of interested views , you wished to prove that she was unjust towards you ; you have done well ; but , to-day the vote has taken place ; far from inheriting , we have had the same thought , you and I , that of voting for Hortense , and giving her that fortune which she reproached you with coveting .

I know well what I say ; I am not a little girl ; I have reflected very much on the subject of what has passed between Hortense and you ; my cousin has been unjust towards me , but I will not be unjust to her !
