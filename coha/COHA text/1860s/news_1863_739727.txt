txt CALOMEL IN THE ARMY . - The recent order of Surgeon-General HAMMOND , prohibiting the use of calomel and tartar emetic in the army , has produced a good deal of lively discussion in medical circles , and is meeting with much criticism and opposition . Dr. liemmobin asserted that the " abuse of calomel produced certain " melancholy effects , " and therefore he abolished its use , or , at all events , directed that it be struck from the medical supply tables . He said that army diseases could be treated as efficiently without as with tartar emetic , and , therefore , he ordered that it also be struck from the supply tables of the army ! The enormous extent to which these two remedial agents are now used by the profession , and the great and beneficent results which are generally attributed to them , will thus each find a check , so far as one-fifth of the able-bodied men of the country are concerned . The army physicians who have long been in the habit of using these potent drugs find themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do for want of them ; and it is feared that the health of the soldiers will be greatly deteriorated . On this point , of course , opinions differ widely ; but a short time must tell ; for the reports of the regimental and division surgeons will furnish a tolerably reliable test In the matter . In the meantime , the accuracy of Dr. JimMOND 'S assertion that " innumerable cases of profuse salivation " and frequent cases of mercurial gangrene inIthe army have arisen from calomel , is criticised ? or , at least , if it be correct , it is doubted that it is at all necessary , if properly educated physicians are employed in the army . The physicians of Cincinnati have taken the matter up on the statement of facts , and have shown that out of twenty-five thousand patients treated in the military hospitals irk the vicinity of that city , got more than nine cases of salivation have oc curred , and not one of mercurial gangrene ; and these nine cases of salivation in 25,000 may be partially accounted for , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which salivation is produced to stop something worse even than gangrene . Dr. BLACKMAN , an old practitioner of national fame , says he has seen as many hospitals and battlefields as any man in the country ; was a long time Medical Director of MITCHEL 'S division ; was two months at ideCi.st. - Las 's headquarters on the Petrinsala , and inspected FRANKLIN 'S division , yet he neither saw nor heard of any cases of mercurial salivation or gangrene . Other physicians give like testimony . In the meantime the question is one of the deepest interest to the profession , to science , and to the welfare of the army and the public generally . We hope ? it will be discussed , in the true spirit of science , by the various learned societies of doctors , and some definite result , based upon accurate observation , and correct and comprehensive data , arrived at . Now that we are all liable to become conscripts , the question of our medical treatment in the field and hospital is one which conies very close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
