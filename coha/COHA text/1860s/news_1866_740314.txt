txt We find the following in the Natal Mercury : " A worthy missionary in Zululand is said to have found a clue to the vestiges of the ancient Ophir , or of some city of equally old and mystical renown . These vestiges are said to have been described to the missionary in question by natives residing to the north of Zululand . They are reputed to be the remains of a large city , covering a wide area , and situated about three days ' trek ( which probably means muchimore ) from where the missionary then was . Approach to them is strictly forbidden and prevented by the chief of the tribe living In the locality . Attention was drawn to the fact by notice being taken of sundry golden ornaments worn by natives at the kraal where these disclosures were made , The precious metal was said to have been obtained from the ruined city or its neighborhood . There is something too romantic about this story , which rests , it will be seen , on the slender foundation of a native tale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light a short time ago , through , we think , the agency of Rev. Mr , DonNa , we should not give prominence to what might be the idle invention of a savage , anxious to prevent the white man 's advance through his territory . A few months ago a reference was publicly made to certain ruined cities , said to have been discovered in the interior , their exact whereabouts being rather vaguely defined . That there is room for areho3ological speculation on this subject can not be denied . That large corner-block of the continent lying between the Transvaal end the Indian Ocean , between Delagoa Bay and Quillimaine , is almost , if not wholly , an unknown land ; and yet , according to popular be . lief , this region was the site of the ancient Ophir , the Biblical El Dorado , while the theory has been hazarded that the Queen of Sheba came from this locality . There to , moreover , the understood fact that the sand found at the mouths of rivers on this coast line contain particles of gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any case the archaeological interest attaching to such discoveries warrants some further investigations concerning the resiiq or the allegations made about them .
