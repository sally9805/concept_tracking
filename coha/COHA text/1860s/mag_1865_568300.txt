ARTICLE V.-TIIE RIGHTS OF THE NATION , AND THE DUTY OF CONGRESS . WE have conquered . Our vast armies , at the magic word of a citizen at Washington , melt away , not into nothingness , like those other hosts that vanished before the spear of Ithurid , but into intelligent and loyal citizens , industrious and enterprising . Ilands that grasped the musket in the charge , now handle ledgers and direct pens . Brawny arms that pointed the great gun , now swing the scythe or the hammer . Yoices that used to ring the . word of command over smoky fields , are now modulated to the whispers of the professional office , or attuned to the ears of listening audiences in silk and broadcloth . Our great iron-clads rest at League Island . Mr. Stanton leaves Washington for the season of rest for which four years of herculean toil have given even him an appetite . In a word , we are at peace ; and the flag of the Republic , symbol now of a purer and worthier nationality than when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern breeze that nears an Atlantic port , and hangs lazily in the perfumed air of the groves of orange and magnolia that border on the Gulf . Dusky forms , clad in blue , examine their passes for lordly IRhetts and ilammonds , or march them to the presence of a Yankee provost marshal . A pale , spare man at Fortress Monroe paces up and down the stone pavement of his casemate , and traces over , in long hours of unbroken meditation , the logical sequence from Calhoun 's speeches , to the surrender of Lee and the capture of a half disguised fugitive in the gray dawn of a Georgia morning . We have conquered , but among thoughtful men there is now the utmost anxiety regarding the future of the Republic . Since those dark hours after the defeat at Chancellorsville , when Lee led his veteran and victorious host across our borders , when other rebels , baser if not as bold , lighted the fires of insurrection in New York ; when the Capital was // threatened , and no Northern city with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting our very life-blood in fruitless endeavor at Ticksburg , and when , all along the line , our standards wavered and our stoutest hearts grew faintsince those darkest hours , just before the glorious dawn of Gettysburg , Yicksburg , and Port Hudson , perhaps there has not been at any time so deep a feeling of distrust and alarm , as now prevails with all to whom the great contest has been one not of names but ideas . The Union is saved , only to be handed over , men fear , to the charge of those who have been its most deadly enemies . Slaves are emancipated ; but whether emancipation shall prove a blessing or a curse , to them and to the nation , depends altogether , it would seem , upon the voluntary conduct of those who have always said it would prove a curse . Slavery is abolished ; but peonage , or some other plan of fbrced labor , hardly less unjust or dangerous to the nation than slavery itself , is the natural result of the present condition of affluirs at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or inclination of the land-owner turns , and the inevitable consequence of any early withdrawal of military control . Slave labor has ceased ; and the masters , whose pride and honor are staked upon the claim that free labor must fail , combine to make it fail . Property in man has ceased ; and Avarice no longer restrains Cruelty , Hate , or Passion from deeds of horror that would be incredible if the slave-pen and Andersonville were not fresh in memory . The freedman 's bureau and the military power-these alone save the blacks today from a fight of extermination between them and their late oppressors . The military power must cease to protect when the work of reconstruction is complete , and that work is pressed with haste . In not a single state has adequate provision been made for the protection of the blacks by civil courts ; in most of them such protection is plainly denied . Mississippi defeats all candidates who advocate negro testimony in courts ; Alabama and South Carolina show the same spirit ; the loyal legislature of Virginia ( so-called ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none to grant the slightest protection to loyal blacks ; Louisiana , in her freestate // constitution , grants no true equality before the law , and even Tennessee , the home of the President , denies the simplest justice to the hated race . Anxiety with regard to the treatment of the negroes is not confined to humanitarians nor philanthropists ; business men know that the prosperity of the whole country depends now in no small degree upon the successful establishment of free labor at the South ; statesmen know that a state where laborers are serfs can never live in healthy union with states whose laborers are citizens ; and the common people remember St. Domingo , feel that injustice , oppression , and cruelty will not be tamely borne by men who have been solemnly promised freedom and protection , and dread a war of races . How shall we deal with four millions of liberated blacks ? Rightly considered , it is the most awful problem that any nation ever undertook to solve . If the solution is to be left to the unfettered choice of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose judgments are blinded by a deeper prejudice and a stronger passion than the old days of oppression ever witnessed , it is no wonder that men are auxions as to the result , and feel that even a long continuance of military control were safer and better than the fearful peril of speedy reconstruction . Those who made it their boast to care nothing for the negro , are forced to care for the nation , its prosperity and its peace . Yet this is not the only cause of anxiety . For four years we have been learning to hate traitors . To see them shaping and controlling in many states the whole work of reconstruction is not pleasant . We look in vain , but too often , for those staunch and fearless loyal men , who were to greet the return of the old flag , whose unforfeited rights as citizens have been the subject of so much keen metaphysical disquisition , and to whom belonged , we were told , those franchises and powers which active rebels had forever lost . South Carolina is searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even in appointing Provisional Governors , it has been necessary , it seems , to take men who have held office under the rebellion . Instead of unflinching union men , confederate officers manage the business of reorganization . The roll of a Southern conven // tion , for titles , reads like a muster-roll of Lee 's army . If elections are held , the staunch unionist is inevitably beaten by some man whose arm was carried away by a union bullet . In some places , as in Richmond and Norfolk , loyal votes are rejected , and rebel votes admitted . Everywhere , without exception , save in Tennessee , the work of reorganization falls to the hands of men whom , less than a year ago , it was lawful for any loyal man to shoot at sight . But , by some people , the temper and conduct of these Southern managers are deemed highly satisfactory . " They accept defeat , " it is said . So the culprit " accepts " imprisonment . They declare void the ordinances of secession . Then they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carolina , however , refuses even by implication to admit that she had not the right to secede , and had not legally seceded ; but she deliberately " repeals " her ordinance of secession , which is very kind of her . They also abolish slavery . But as they have been plainly told that without this all other action would be empty and fruitless , and military rule would be surely continued , we find in that act no especial merit or evidence of change of disposition ; the less , as they all take pains to declare that this reform is effected , not by their own free choice , but by the military power of the United States . We are hardly left in doubt whether , if they should ever have the power , they would reestablish the system so reluctantly abandoned . Nor do we find , in any of these states , meagre performance eked out by any generou* heartiness of spirit . The passage of secession ordinances was hailed with salvos of cannon , peals of bells , contagious huzzas ; with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The abrogation or repeal of these ordinances comes from a cold and formal convention to a sullen and silent people . The tokens of popular favor are reserved for those who denounce the abolition of slavery as an act of shameless tyranny , and rant about the infinite evils to which it will lead . Neither act nor spirit gives assurance of any change of feeling . Yet we are assured that these men have repented , and may now be trusted as more earnest and faithful in loyalty than those same // unflinching union men for whom we searched so vainly . To believe it is to ignore the tone of almost every speech or paper that comes from the South . It is to forget that Southern colleges , railroads , and business institutions , make haste to honor soldiers whose only triumphs have been over the flag of the Republic , and whose names are linked forever with the Fort Pillow massacre and the horrors of Andersonville . It is to forget that in every convention , early after the routine of organization , there were resolutions offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief magistrate , Jefferson Davis , " and that such formal petitions come from every convention that has lately assembled . It is to forget that these men fought as long as there was a chance , sacrificing of their property without stint ; and that their present attitude of submisEion has both hope and compulsion for excuse . It is to believe that the shame of defeat has engendered in haughty and passionate spirits no thirst for revenge ; that losses heavier than any other people have ever borne , have stimulated only affection for the hand that smites them ; and that fiery antagonisms of race and belief , that have existed ever since Cavaliers and IRoundheadsfought at Kaseby , having been fed generation after generation , and fanned into the intensest flames of hatred by hostile customs and institutions , have been quelled by four years of suffering , and quenched by the final agony of overthrow . Has the boundless malignity that made the prison pens eternally infamous vanished in an instant , like a horrid nightmare , under the soothing influence of defeat ? The Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They tell us frankly that they submit , hold conventions , abolish slavery , and abrogate acts of secession , not because they are union men , but because they can not help it . " We have fought as long as we could , " they say . " Abolition is an outrage , but we must vote it . Secession was our right ; but we are conquered . We must bide our time . Whatever is demanded as a condition of our restoration , we must vote . There is no other way to get this military yoke off our necks . When we get into Congress , amid grasp hands with Northern Democrats , and these bayonets are out of the way , then ! // When that time comes , we will deal with the negroes as we like . They are a lazy set . They will not work for such wages as we choose to give , and must be made to work . Then we will put a stop to this insulting intermeddling of Northern directors and teachers called a Freedman 's Bureau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will set aside all political disabilities imposed upon the leaders in our struggle for independence . Do not suppose that we will have pensions and rewards paid from the treasury to men or families of men who have fought against us , while those who have been killed or maimed in our cause want such care . Pension laws we will repeal , and let each state take such care as it chooses and can of its own soldiers . Then as to the debt ; do you fancy that we will be taxed to pay a debt created in whipping us ? Do you suppose we will suffer the interest upon that debt to be paid from a national treasury ? Not a dollar shall come from us , when we can help it . With the increased representation in Congress to which the emancipation of the negroes entitles us , and with the great Democratic party reunited , we can soon recover the control of the government . Then the war debt shall be repudiated . The abolition states may divide the federal debt between them , and pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divide among the Southern states the confederate debt . Let each section take care of its own obligations and bear the burdens which it has created . When that has been accomplished , the federal government will be shorn of its strength , its credit will be destroyed , and no one will ever again lend money to help on a war of coercion against any of the states . Then we can lay new plans of separation , with no fear of the result . In all these schemes we shall find Northern friends as willing as they were when secession was undertaken , as hearty in sympathy , if , also , as cowardly in action , as they were during the war . But first we want pardon and restoration . Until we get back our state governments and our power in Congress , the less we show our feelings the better . " Those who have access to papers and constant intelligence from the South , know how truly this paints the spirit of Southern movements . Between the wary leader , who signi // flcantly urges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the indiscreet disciple who threatens what shall be done when restoration is complete , the difference is one of reticence and cunning . In counting upon the aid of a Northern party , they do not reckon without their host . The speeches at Democratic conventions , the New York riots , the Chicago plot , and the records of the Golden Circle , show the spirit that animates the controlling men of that party . Through the thick darkness of their political infamy and ostracism , there gleams no ray of hope except in the final triumph of the rebels of the South . By that light they steer . With an energy that only new confidence of success could beget , they battle for immediate and unconditioned restoration of rebel states to their full political powers . Every measure or demand in behalf of the nation 's honor or safety , they resist as one man . They denounce the punishment of traitors . They clamor for universal amnesty . The confiscation policy they term disgraceful . The constitutional amendment abolishing slavery is gall and wormwood to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states , they ridicule and will repeal if they can . The integrity of the national debt they already insidiously threaten under color of a demand for equal taxation by the states . The theory everywhere maintained by that party is that the Southern states have by rebellion forfeited no right whatever ; that they are already states , in precisely the same sense and with precisely the same powers as those that have not rebelled ; that neither President , Congress , nor People have any right to require of them any changes , or impose upon them any conditions ; that if either of them refuses to abolish slavery or ratify the constitutional amendment , it can not on that account be denied representation in Congress ; that military control at the South is a usurpation which must cease at once ; and that all these rebellious states must be restored to their full powers , no matter whether rebels or union men control them , and must be granted their full representation in Congress and the Electoral College , no matter what changes they may make or refuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , this great party , still true as steel to its // treasonable alliance , demands now , as it demanded at Chicago , that beaten rebels shall dictate terms to the nation , and that they shall be restored to all their rights and powers , not upon conditions that satisfy the nation , but upon such conditions as they may voluntarily offer ! Such willful treachery to the cause of the people would be incredible , if the last live years could be forgotten . These men , at least , have not been converted by the hallowing influences of defeat , and in their hands the great Democratic party is a perfect , well-oiled engine , obedient to the slightest touch upon the valves , and incapable of any principle or emotion except hunger . From that party , we may be sure , there will never come aid or protection for the blacks in any extremity of oppression . Men who called emancipation an act of robbery , will have little solicitude for the rights of freedmen . Men who rejoiced when Sumter fell or when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such a South Carolina as Wade Hampton may represent . Men who declared the war a failure in 1864 , are not resolute to make it a success in 1865 . Men who would have sold the national honor or existence in 1860 for Southern trade , now denounce as destructive any policy that would postpone the restoration of the South for such frivolous objects as the public faith and safety . The gathering of wolves shows where the wild beast has found a prey . The baying of the hounds shows which way the hunt is corning . The efforts of the INorthern allies of the rebellion cast a flood of light upon the secret designs of Southern traitors . A reorganization that disarmed rebels direct and shape , and that Northern tories delight in , and labor with might and main to make permanent , is not one that loyal men can witness without alarm . The situation is not cheering . Breakers ahead , a furious storm behind , and a leaking ship beneath ! For it must be admitted that the loyal men of the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pursued . New England , foremost in the great moral revolution which preceded the war , and most earnest in the defense of the nation when Sumter fell , now takes the lead in demanding security for the // future . Her statesmen and organs of public opinion , with a unanimity that proves the depth of the popular feeling , now insist that reconstruction shall not be suffered to forfeit the national honor and the national safety ; that the pledge of the Declaration of Independence , endorsed in the Emancipation Proclamation , shall not be violated ; that the faith of the nation , given to those whose loans have saved the national existence , shall not be broken ; and that the real Union for which we have fought  --  a Union of interests , of institutions and of rights-shall not be exchanged for another hollow truce of confederation , binding faith to falsehood , public education to public ignorance , free labor to servitude , and republicanism to an aristocracy of the purse and skin . Sturdy men of the Northwest , who " hewed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " join in the demand . Even Pennsylvania , knowing by bitter experience what war means , breaks from the constitutional conservatism and timidity of the middle zone , and enters her plea for the national security and honor . But these are the pleasing features of the prospect ; there are others of a more sombre cast . Many intelligent men , with that magnanimity which is the vice of noble natures , cherish a chivalric trust in the chivalric honor of the South , think it a great thing that the haughty Carolinian should accept results which he could not prevent , and please themselves with a conviction that all is going on very well . A comfortable , lotus-eating optimism settles down in the belief that enough has been done for Freedom and Justice , and dreamily mutters : " There is no joy but calm . Let us alone . What pleasure can we have To war with evil ? Is there any peace In ever climbing up the climbing wave I " The war well over , the great mass of the people begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energies to the making of money . Every day the magic shuttles of trade are weaving bands between Southern land-owners and Northern voters-subtle threads that penetrate every workshop and counting room , that would have sacrificed right to // convenience in 1860 , and that will soon be felt once more in elections and in Congress . Politicians , to whom success is the only duty , and principles and truths but the painted cards with which the game is played , with a single eye to the election of 1868 , are already planning for the support of " Southern union * Conventions in great and powerful states meet and pass resolutions as barren as the east wind , faithfully expurgate every trace of principle upon any vital question of the day , frown . upon the reckless agitator who would talk of national safety or honor , and leave records as meaningless and vague as the paintings in the Greek fable under which was written , " This is a * " This is a cow , " for the convenience of spectators . The old prejudices of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people of a New England state . The anxiety of loyal and thinking men , justified by the resolute bearing of the rebels and their Northern allies , finds little relief in the divided councils and faltering steps of those to whom the nation must look for aid in its time of peril . It is most unfortunate that , rather by a few isolated expressions than by his general management , a President elected by loyal votes should give to the allies of rebellion some color of ' pretence for claiming him as their leader and chief . We can not believe that Mr. Johnson , whose scathing denunciations of treason won him the confidence of the people , has for these tories , who have shown all the baseness and disloyalty with none of the pluck and manhood of rebels , any other feeling than unutterable loathing . It is impossible to believe that a President who retains Edwin M. Stanton in his cabinet , can really propose deliberate treachery to the cause by which he was elected to office . His heart must be right ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their consequences than those of the heart . It can not be more , and it surely is not less , than an error of judgment that has made the name of the President a tower of strength to those who clamor for the immediate restoration of rebels to full political rights on such terms as they may please . His admission of pardoned whites and exclusion of the loyal blacks , in prescribing the basis of // reorganization , was not absolute justice , though in his judgment the best policy that the people would then sustain . And his reason for that course-that the regulation of their own policy of suffrage is a right which " the several states " have always " rightfully exercised "  --  a reason which applies with equaL propriety to other steps in his own procedure , and which , by logical inference , condemns in advance every precautionary measure which Congress could adopt-has become the rallying cry of those whose political future depends upon the linmediate and unconditional restoration of rebels to power . It impliedly answers  --  and answers not rightly  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What can the nation lawfully do to protect itself and its honor ? " It implies that the nation is confined ; in its dealings with the rebellious coininunities , to the powers conferred upon it by the Constitution over organized and loyal states  --  a view not justified by sound reason nor by his own method in dealing with those communities , and which , if logically followed , would leave the nation wholly at the mercy of its conquered foes . Either the states that have been in rebellion are now in such condition , notwithstanding that rebellion , as to be entitled to the rights and powers accorded to states in the Constitution , or they are not in such condition . If they are , then they are now entitled to all the rights and powers of states . The Constitution either gives , or it does not give . Treason either forfeits all , or none . If , then , those communities are in such condition , they can elect their own Governors , retain their own constitutions if they choose , and claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as men of legal qualifications are elected , and neither President nor Congress has any right to deny or delay that representation , or to require of them any changes whatever in their constitutions or laws . Whatever rights the constitution gives , it gives to all states alike . There is no such thing known to our constitution or system of government as a " state " which can exercise part of the rights of a state , but is not equally entitled to them all . Now , as all men know , President Johnson does not treat these communities as being entitled to all the rights of states . Either , then , his // treatment is unconstitutional , or these communities are not in such condition as to be entitled to any of the rights of " states " under the Constitution ; and , in dealing with them , the government is bound only by its duty to the nation , and to its loyal people , of whatever color , and by no constitutional barriers or rules of precedent . President Johnson does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of states . Except in the suffrage matter , his whole policy is in glaring contradiction to that theory . He appoints Provisional Governors , and invests them with executive functions . Does the Constitution empower a President to appoint Governors for " states ? " He excludes from suffrage a large number of qualified electors under the laws of the former states , who have never yet been convicted of any crime against the United States . By what right could he disfranchise half the citizens of Massachusetts ? Elections held under the authority of the only civil government in Virginia , were by his order set aside and pronounced void . Where does the Constitution empower the President to nullify the elections in a state ? Courts throughout the South are warned that in a certain class of cases they shall not assume jurisdiction , and this , too , after those courts have been reorganized under the authority of the President . Military officers , the agents of the national Executive , try all cases in which negroes are concerned ; set aside state laws constantly , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to review their decisions . What color of authority does the Constitution give for such wholesale interference with the courts of " states ? " But there are even more striking proofs than these that the rebel communities are not regarded as now possessing the rights of constitutional states . There is no more solemn act of sovereignty than the adoption or amendment of a state constitution . There is no power belonging to a state more important than that which is exercised in the final ratification of an amendment of the National Constitution . Yet President Johnson has plainly declared to the rebellious communities that they must not only abolish slavery as a local institution , by amendment of their state constitutions and // laws , but must give their formal assent to the anti slavery amendment of the National Constitution , or they will not be restored to the power and representation of members of the Union . No man pretends that a President can rightly impose such conditions upon New Jersey or Delaware . Yet , if the Constitution accords any rights or powers whatever to South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey . If South Carolina is a state , within the meaning of the Constitution , in such condition that she can claim as a member of the Union any of the powers or rights accorded by that supreme law to states , then she can claim them all ; can alter her constitution or not as she chooses , can elect her own Governor , establish her own courts , and imprison military officers who dispute or attempt to restrict their jurisdiction ; and , above all , can pronounce without fear or favor her own independent verdict of assent or rejection upon the amendment of the National Constitution . The conclusion is one that no reasoning mind can evade . The rebel communities , call them by what name we please , are not now in such condition that they are entitled to rights or powers as states under the provisions of the Constitution . They have , at present , no constitutional rights whatever . There are obvious reasons . The states to which the Constitution secures rights , have an organization ; these have not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Union , in full and harmonious " practical relations " with its government . The unorganized communities with which we have to do were but now banded together in war against the Union . By their own act they ceased to have " practical relations " with the Government . They are now conquered enemies , and must accept such terms as the nation can affor&amp; to give . To defeated rebels the Constitution gives no political right whatever . The Union has the absolute and untrammeled power of the conqueror . It can hold in military subjection , or place under territorial governments , or admit as states upon just such conditions as it pleases to prescribe . Such is the true theory , and with that theory President Johnson 's procedure is at every point , save one , in strict accordance . The // acts to which we have referred were not unconstitutional . He justly disfranchised rebels ; he had the same power to enfranchise loyal men . He justly required the constitutional abolition of slavery . He might , also , with equal right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced . We shall not doubt his sincerity and patriotism . But his use of language , implying that the rebel communities are even now entitled to all the rights and powers which loyal states have rightfully exercised , has not been harmless ; it has given the sanction of his high authority to most mischievous reasonings , and the prestige of his apparent approval to the designs of the worst enemies of the Government . The nation now stands face to face with a great peril . " All is quiet , " but there is an awful hush that precedes the hurricane . What soldier does not remember those eternities of silence that break the roar of great battles-pauses that tell of reforming columns and new plans of attack , and are followed by the bloodiest charges of the day ? The contest was not closed when Lee surrendered . It only changed its form . We have no longer a known foe and an open field . Intrigue and chicanery come by gift of nature to all Southern races . For skirmishes we are to have speeches ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the sessions of Legislatures and Congresses . The rebel puts aside the bayonet , and takes up the ballot . It is for us to say whether it will not prove the more deadly weapon of the two . Within the next six months eleven new organizations , claiming to be states , will apply for restoration of political powers . With the national Congress rests absolute power to admit , delay . or reject , and , in case of delay or rejection , to make such provision for the government of the conquered territory or the future organization of its inhabitants , as the national safety may require . If the nation had the shadow of right to crush the rebellion , it has now full right to protect itself , and all its loyal citizens , against the political influence of rebels whose arms it has taken , and whose lives it has spared . In all things essential to the success of a Republican form of government , it is not only the right but the duty of Congress to dictate terms . In the exer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and held to strict account by a vigorous public sentiment . And while pointing out the pernicious influence of the President 's error of logic , it is right to say that he has thus far shown a determination to leave Congress untrammeled in its decision upon the terms to be granted to rebel states . While he has rightly declared that the abolition of slavery and the ratification of the Constitutional amendment were tests which Congress would not fail to apply , he has never implied that other conditions might not properly be required . He has declared that the organizations under his proclamations are experimental in character , and that it will rest with Congress alone to determine whether they have resulted in the establishment of truly loyal and Republican governments . Upon what conditions , then , is it the duty of Congress to insist ? What practical policy will defeat the new schemes of unrepentant rei ) els and their allies ? We have , first , to protect the national honor . The faith of the nation is pledged to the abolition of slavery ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full security , a ratification of the national amendment , will be required . But the freedom which the nation has solemnly promised is not a mere nominal emancipation . It involves full protection in all rights of person and property-absolute equality before the law . No man will pretend that such protection is possible , after the withdrawal of bureau superintendence and military power , unless the testimony of the freedman is received in all the courts , and his rights of contract and property are placed upon the same basis as those of whites . Such provisions do not yet exist in any rebel state . Had the conventions which have been held incorporated provisions of this nature into the new constitutions , there would have been some security at least , that the rights of the loyal blacks would not be forever at the mercy of every state legislature . Every convention , as yet , has refused to do anything of the kind . The subject was not overlooked ; the certainty that a just Congress would not overlook it seems to have been borne in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for the // protection of the freedmen , and " to guard the state against the evils which may result from their sudden emancipation . " If it was thought that this va*ue but almost insulting formula would satisfy the just demands of a nation , whose faith is pledged to secure to these victims of oppression and hatred full and permanent protection in all their natural rights , surely Conhress will not fail to teach the masters their error ! It is a matter of the first importance . Rightly does Governor Marvin of Florida-whose sterling loyalty , and exalted statesmanship , do great credit to the President 's selection , and whose noble sentiments we may hope are but the echo of those entertained at the White House-declare that unless Florida alters her constitution in this respect , securing by the most solemn sanctions perpetual protection to the blacks in their rights of person and property , he will not hope nor wish to see her constitution accepted , or her representatives admitted by Congress . Of the temper of the people to whom this honorable advice is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in states where reorganization has co mmenced both the people and their delegates have given the matter the cold shoulder . Full well these Southern leaders know that laws passed by a legislature , though they might satisfy some Northern consciences , would give no permanent protection , since they would be liable to repeal at the next session after full restoration had removed all restraint upon the popular prejudice . Should Congress neglect this matter , it will outrage the moral sense and the honor of the North . We can not justly leave all the rights of the freedmen at the mercy of those who so long held them in slavery . We can not safely leave four millions of people so utterly defensele*s against the cruelty or revenge of a hostile and exasperated race . The speech of Florida 's noble Governor may well be the beacon light by which we shape our course . Let states that deny free men a hearing in their courts , states that make justice a matter of color , nay , states that do not grant full protection of rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sent back to the furnace for another trial . It is held by some that the whole black code of the Southem // states will be rendered unconstitutional by the final adoption of the anti-slavery amendment . But who can guarantee that a just construction of the Constitution will prevail in every state , or that laws practically nullifying its provisions will not be devised ? For years before the war , the slave states flagrantly set at defiance constitutional obligations . Citizens of Northern states were constantly denied rights to which , under the constitutional provisions of comity , they were clearly entitled . In fifteen states of the Union , free speech was practically abolished . Our form of government , presuming much upon the fidelity of states to constitutional obligations , makes but slender provision for the practical enforcement of those obligations , and , as a matter of fact , the protection of the rights of the blacks will chiefly depend , not upon any formal changes in the laws , but upon the temper of the Southern people . Without referring in detail to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by exasperated whites , to the urgent appeals from humane and loyal men against the removal of military control and bureau superintendence , or to the statements of unprejudiced observers or military officers of every shade of political opinion , there is abundant evidence that the Southern people do not yet show such a spirit that they can be safely left to deal as they please with those whom the nation has so recently rescued from bondage , and that the existing passion and prejudice would render ineffective the best laws ever framed . While the present state of feeling lasts , to withdraw the protecting power of the nation , and restore the rebel states to full control over their domestic affairs , would be a deed of the most heartless cruelty . Indeed , it would be not only inhur*an , but suicidal . It would end in anarchy , and a war of races . For this difficulty there are but two remedies ; to continue military or provisional government until a different stateof feeling is developed , or to give to the blacks an invulnerable shield of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ logically deny the power of Congress to enfranchise the negroes , as the only sufficient guarantee of their true freedom and equality before the law . But there are many who doubt // whether the negroes themselves should not have some opporturiity of becoming familiar with their new rights and duties , before the best results can be expected from their exercise of the highest privilege of citizenship ; whether any healthy political organization can be formed , until the labor problem ha* been practically solved , and its difficulties adjusted ; whether , during the period of adjustment , the protective interference of the general government is not imperatively demanded , and whether , in any event , the hnmcdiate restoration of rebel states to political power would not be most dangerous to the nation . A term of probation will work no injustice to the whites . To the blacks , there are incalculable advantages in delay . And , in view of the fearful peril of immediate reconstruction upon a white basis , even those who are not yet prepared for the enfranchisement of the blacks can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government , until the whites of the South manifest a decided change of temper . To those of either opinion , the immediate duty is the sam e . Recognition , permanent establishment , and representation in Congress , must be refused for the present to all the revolted states . Provisional government or military control must be maintained , until there is sufficient evidence , both in the form of their laws and in the temper of the people , that the rebel communities can he safely restored to their political powers as members of the Union . Should resolute adherence to this single just principle cause the rejection of every rebel state , as at present organized , it will prevent all necessity of formal action upon other tests upon which loyal men might differ . It will thus throw open the whc*e question as to the best mode of governing the rebel communities during the transition period , and the precautions to be taken and the basis to be adopted for their permanent organization . Congress will then consider how to protect the truly loyal whites of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management of affairs an influence of which , at present , they seem to have little . It will also have in mind the protection of the national credit , remembering that the public faith is pledged to those who have given of their substance // to secure our victory . It is idle to say that no party will ever try to repudiate the national debt . So men said that no party would ever seek to destroy the Union . Join to the Northern Democracy the eleven states seeking restoration as now controlled , and repudiation , or division of the national and rebel war debts among the states , would almost surely follow . Nor is there any other matter of more lasting importance than provision for popular education at the South . Well filled schi ol houses are a better pled*e of loyalty than well manned forts . New England men , armed with muskets , have made the Southern people submissive ; to make them loyal , prosperous , and fit to share in the glories of the future Union , send New England women armed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in states where the education of the people is forbidden by law or practice . For each and all of these difficulties there is one ultimate remedy . To secure liberal provision for the education of the laboring class , give to the laboring class the ballot . To secure to the laborer sure protection in his rights of person and property  --  a protection more complete and permanent than any constitutional provision can give-put into his hands the ballot . To guard the national credit , arm with the ballot that class of whose freedom the national debt is the price . To crush forever the dominance of an aristocracy of purse or skin , make citizens of those who have been slaves . To build up loyal states at the South , trust not the absolute control to whites , known to be hostile in feeling , who still cherish theories which make oaths of allegiance a farce ; trust rather the blacks , who are loyal , as the whites are disloyal , in obedience to prejudices and passions more potent than any logic or eda cation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the nation , or to protect the rights of the blacks ; the solution is ever the same . And then impartial suffrage is right . No man . can make it anything but an outrage to deny civil privileges on the ground of color . No man can pretend that it is truly republican for a minority to control a majority , or truly safe to put loyal men at the mercy of rebels . To these and other reasons , there is but one answer : ( Jon // necticut , a New England state , has refused ! There are some arguments so utterly illogical that no man can answer them , and this is one . Why , of six New England states , the example of one should be called conclusive , and the example of five worthless , or why another state can not be expected to attempt a just thing until all the New England states have done it , or why any state should be governed by the example of any other state in such a question , it would puzzle any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and common justice , does that make it necessary for the whole country to do likewise ? If Connecticut has forgotten which century it is , can no other state remember ? The argument becomes yet more absurd , when we reflect that Connecticut has not rebelled , and is not under the absolute control of the National Government because of her rebellion , nor has she voted to disfranchise an actual majority of her loyal citizens . She has not lost her rights of self-government under the Constitution . The votes of her negroes are not necessary to make her tolerably loyal . But South Carolina has a minority of disloyal whites , and a majority of loyal blacks ; her whites have cast to the winds their franchises and powers under the Constitution , and it is just , truly republican , and eminently prudent , to call to the aid of the nation the majority hitherto disfranchised . The example of Connecticut has nothing to do with the obligation of the Government to secure protection to the loyal men , black or white , at the South ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compels the nation to protect itself , at once against a war of races , and against the restoration of states under rebel influence . The nation has in its guardianship four millions of freedmen at the South . At the same time it has its own safety and honor to protect . It can elevate the freedmen to the dignity of true citizenship , and they will then protect themselves and the national interests . Or it can leave them to the degrading and oppressive policy of those who would have kept them slaves , and who still mean to keep them serfs or peons , and the result will be perpetual danger of black insurrections and of white rebellions . The example of Connecticut has nothing to do with that alternative . // The cynic who doubted whether man was a reasoning being , had much to justify him . Precisely because the action of Connecticut has in reason nothing to do with the true policy to be pursued at the South , it will be all the more potent in fact . Prejudices outweigh syllogisms . And a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small-pox . There are , very likely , one hundred thousand voters , in this enlightened Republic , who were favorably inclined in September to the enfranchisement of loyal blacks at the South , and who , on this tenth day of October , having heard that Connecticut preferred " a white man 's government , " think that sorry phrase the epitome of all social and political science . In plain terms , the vote in Connecticut has both stimulated and developed a degree of prejudice which it should be the effort of all truly loyal men to enlighten and remove . Meanwhile , it is fortunate that the immediate restoration of rebel communities need not depend upon the suffrage question , upon which public opinion is yet but half formed . It will be found that those communities grant no adequate or permanent protection to loyal men of the South , in their rights of person and property . That alone will be just ground for deterring the restoration of political powers . It will be found that the laws of those states make no such provision for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form of government . It will be found that the true union men have been pushed into the background , and that the control has fallen into hands red with loyal blood . Not even the election of men personally unexceptionable as representatives will lead Congress to overlGok those vital points . Acting upon *nch considerations as these , there can be no doubt that Congress will be sustained by the people . The sober second thought will not justify the clamor for hasty settlement of such momentous issues as are now involved . Sturdy and long-lived plants do not shoot up in a night . Eleven states , with ten millions of people ! It is not work that should be hurried . Postponement does no harm . It gives time for education of the people of the South ; time for the full establishment of free labor ; time for the immigration of loyal men from the North ; time for Northern // capital , enterprise , and intellect to grasp the direction of affairs , and to shape both industrial and political activity in harmony with the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duties and responsibilities of freedom ; time for the exacerbated passions that strife and suffering have engendered to become tempered by reflection and interest . It gives time for the assured adoption of the amendment abolishing slavery , and for the passage and ratification of a constitutional amendment proportioning representation to the number of qualified electors . It gives time for the people of the North to study the problem before them , to winnow away the chaff of prejudice and ignorance , and bring out the conscience , the reason , and the practical sense . Time is wanted ! here it is not delay that is dangerous . And before another session of Congress , we may hope to see reorganization at the South upon a safer , a wiser , and a juster basis . It thrills one to think what a glorious nation care and patience will now give us . Riding by night in a railroad train , we think little of the thousand dangers , little , perhaps , of the happy home beyond . Go out to the front of the engine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precious lives and hopes , thunders on into the darkness ; how destruction lurks in the decaying tie , the loosened rock , the over-hanging tree ! Then there comes , fresh and clear , the vision of the bright fireside , the waiting wife and child , and it makes the nerves quiver to think how little a thing would take one forever from the joys of that welcome , and send desolation and mourning , instead of gladness , to that household . So , as we study the future of our country , it makes one tremble with excitement to think of all the glories and blessings that await wise statesmanship . A land richer and more prosperous than poet or prophet have ever imagined , knit together in every part by harmony of interests and homogeneity of institutions , and developed in all its wonderful resources by hopeful labor , active thought , and enterprising capital ; a land where just laws make peace perpetual and rights secure , where poor and rich are alike protected , and neither justice nor hope is denied to any man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village // has its school-house , and every child its teacher ; a land whose matchless prosperity invites and rewards the stoutest arms , the most skillful hands , the best brains of every nation upon earth ; a mighty Republic , commanding the respect of all nations ! Such a nation , holding up to all mankind for wonder and admiration its glorious example of the triumph of selfgovernment , shall win , year by year , new bloodless victories over Proscription , Tyranny , and Established Wrong , prostrating thrones , and elevating everywhere " the standard of the Peoples " - " Till the war-drum throbs no longer , and the battle flags are furled , In the Parliament of man , the Federation of the world . There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe , And the kindly earth shall slumber , lapt In universal law . " Such the nation , such the destiny that we may realize , if at this crisis of our history we have a Congress true to the people , and a people true to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
