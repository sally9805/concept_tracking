A CHRISTIAN NEIGHBORHOOD . " Thou shalt lore thy neighbor as thyself " How do we love ourselves ? Not for qualitias that plaase us , but , whether good or evil , handsome or homely , with good mannars or withOut them , we all desire and choose to make self happq . This is the meaning of loving self in the above command . It is our duty to love self as much as it is to love our neighbor ; and as the care of our own body and soul is committed to us more than to any other person , we are bound to give more time aud attention to self than to any other . But we are commanded by our Creator to regard and value the happiness of our neighbors as we do our own . This is required , not because they have agreeable qualities that please us , but because love is the fulfilling of that great law of virtue and happiness which rules in the kingdom of heaven , and which the Lord of heaven came to establish upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ , that , though he was rich , yet for your sakes he became poor , that ye through his poverty might be rich . -2 car . viii . 9 . " Now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his . - Born. viii . 9 . " Ho*v hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of heaven . ' " We must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ ; that every one may receive the things done in the body , according to that he haM done , whether it he good or bad . Knowing therefore the terror of the Lord , we persuade men . ' -2 tior. v. 10 , 11 . At this time , when wealth is coming like a flood , and thousands even of the professed followers of Christ are hasting to he rich , these words of Holy Writ should be anxiously pondered . The great question , to those who have an abundance , is , flow are we to follow the example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we through his poverty might be rich ? It the spirit of Christ is that of self- sacrlf cing haneyolence , and if any man have not this spirit he is none of his , who among the rich and prosperous are to enter the kingdom of heaven ? Perhaps this article may aid in answering this question . In a previous Number ( November , 1865 ) the writer gave drawings of a house designed to secure econom*i of time , labor , and expense , and also designed to enable a woman of refined tastes to train her children , in an agreeable manner to the domestic exercise so indispensable to woman 's health and to a perfect Ghristian home . In a succeeding Number ( May , 1866 ) was presented plans for securing a heult4frl home , mid , as indispensable to this , a properly warmed and ventilated house . It is the aim of this article to make some suggestions as to the use of wealth and leisure to secure a Christian Neighborhood . In noticing the dwellings of the prosperous class , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one is led to inqnire-not of all , but in many cases-Are these exhibiting that selfdenying benevolence which is the tine spirit of Christ , and without which they are none of his ? Let us sketch such a neighborhood as may be observed in the vicinity of any of our large cities . We find six or eight large mansions and extensive grounds arranged with lavish expenditures . On an average each may contain five or six persons living in parlors , and nearly as many living in kitchens . Those in the parlor have books and pictures , fancy-work , horses , carriages , and leisure to visit , receive company , and travel . Excepting the father , they do nothing to earn their livelihood . They do but little of the work of the family , and have little to do with the servants except to see that they do their work satisfactorily . The children of the family are educated to enjoy this life themselves , instead of working for the good of others . To have a good time in this world seems to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps take a class in Sunday-school , give a few dollars , from their abundance , in charity , and perhaps a few hours each week to some charitable association . But the main business of their life is to have a good time in getting various enjoyments for self in this world . They practice little or no self-denial for others , and engage in no earnest , systematic , or lahorious efforts to rescue their fellow-creatures from ignorance and sin . It seems to be taken for granted that it is those of small means who are to work and practice self-denial in training the neglected children of our Heavenly Fathem ; but that as soon as riches increase then they are to cease laboring for others , and have a good time in gaining all manner of earthly enjoyments . Now the great difficulty is this : The literal following of Christ in the direction , " Sell that thou hast and give to time poor , and come and follow me , " literally obeyed by all the rich , would throw out of employment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture and sale of articles of comfort and luxury to the rich . And as the inventions to lessen labor increase , there is no way to supply remunerative labor to all classes except to increase the elegance and comforts of life-to patronize the fine arts and all the refinements of high civilization . It therefore can not be the duty of all Christians to follow Christ by literally becoming poor . But the more talents are given , and the higher the culture attained , the greater the obligation to discover the true manner in which Christ 's teachings are to be followed and his spirit exhibited . And because this is a difficult problem to solve , multitudes of those profe.ssing to follow Christ throw it aside as unintelligible and unpractical , and content themselves with living as all the rest of the world do who make no pretensions to be the disciples of Christ . For this reason it was that our Lord exclaimed , " How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of heaven I " It will be the aim in what follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperous families which would be more conformed to the spirit of Christ than those which usually prevail . Look at any city where the residences of the wealthy abound . There will be found six or more mansions , each surrounded by several acres of highly cultivated and ornamented grounds , and near by small tenement-houses , abounding with children , each house having about as many square yards of land as the large houses have square acres . The first thing to be noticed is the manner in which labor is divided . In the small tenements the boys rise early and go forth with the father to work in the pure air and life-giv ing sun . They work from eight to ten hours , with little opportunity for amusement or for reading or study . In the large houses the boys sleep till a late breakfast , then study or play till school-time , then spend three hours in a crowded and ill-ventilated school , stimulating brain and nerves . Then home to a hearty dinner , and than again to school three hours . Thus one class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of the brain ; the other class work the brain , with little exercise of the muscles and little sun and air . So with the girls : in the tenement-houses the girls go to kitchens and shops to work most of the day , with little chance for mental culture or the refinements of taste . In the large mansions the daughters sleep late , do but little labor for the family , and spend their time in school , or in light reading . Some make and mend their own wardrobe , but hired labor is needed to complete it in most cases . Thus one class are trained to feel that they are a privileged few for whom others are to work , while they do only a very little to promote the impr&amp;vement or enjoyment of their poorer neighbors . Then , again , labor being confined chiefly to the unrefined and uncultivated , is disgraced and rendered unattractive to the young . One class is overworked , and the body deteriorates from excess . The other class overwork the brain and nerves , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One class has round shoulders , projecting necks , and hard hands , from excess of toil . The other class have stooping shoulders , projecting necks , and flat chests , from want of muscular exercise . One class is all brain , nerves , refinement , and selfish indolence ; the other class is all muscle , is vulgar , unrefined , and envious . Now of this wealthy class , thus described , many are professed Christians , who really wish to obey Christ 's teachings and cherish his true self-sacrificing spirit . They feel that , somehow , this state of things is wrong , and yet they see no practicable way of reme ( ly , and so they go on from year to year . The next thing to be noticed is the style in // which the more wealthy classes accumulate the elegances of civilization without even an attempt to elevate their destitute neighbors to this culture and enjoyment . Their expensive pictures multiply on their frescoed walls , their elegant hooks increase in their closed book-cases , their fine pictures and prints remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a privileged few . Their handsome equipages are for the comfortable and prosperous-not for the feeble and pool who have none of their own . All their social amusements are exclusive , and their expensive entertainments are for those only who can return the same to them . Our Divine Master thus teaches : " When thou makest a feast call not thy kinsmen or thy rich neighbors , lest they also bid thee again , and a recompense he made thee . But when thou makest a feast call the poor , for they can not recompense thee ; for thou shalt be recoinI ) ensed at the resurrection of the just . " Again , our Lord , after performing the most servile office , taught thus : " If I , vour Lord and Master , have washed your feet , ye ought to wash one another 's feet . " Now does the ordinary habits of Christ 's professed followers in the prosperous classes correspond in any way with the spirit inculcated in these divine directions ? Is it difficult for such to know when anti how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need of effort to overcome the difficulty . And is it not for want of such effort that it is written , " How hardly shall they that have riches enter the kingdom of heaven ? " Now , without marking out any exact rule , or describing any definite course of action , we will suppose that in such a neighborhood certain qwq and therefore could be reproduced in such a neighborhood . In a large country town is a gentleman and his wife , between thirty and forty years of age , who have had no children of their own . A few years ago they took two young girls , whom the lady trained in all the domestic duties of the family state , while in the evening the gentleman gave them lessons preparing them to be teachers in common schools , or good wives and mothers should they marry . The son of an absent soldier shared in the same privileges . Then these Christian workers adopted two motherless little girls , one of them an invalid and a cripple . To aid in this increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as assistant cook and nurse . The sickly cripple child is now blooming with health , and the foster-mother has gained remarkable development and vigor by her increased domestic labor ; and now they are planning to take another orphan child . Meantime their reputation for benevolence has brought matty a homeless wanderer to their doer to be clothed , fed , and comforted till a place was found for them to earn their own livelihood . Being persons of taste and culture and some means , they bad a moderate collection of books , pictures , and works of art . These were not confined to themselves and their circle of friends . Seeking the co - operation of their neighbors and friends , a suit of rooms were fitted up with carpets , sofas , piano , sewing-machines , and many of the elegances and comforts found in the parlors of the rich . Arid here this benevolent couple placed most of their library and their choicest works of art . Stimulated by this example others made similar con- // a living as dress-maker . Thus these two find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labor , while one earns her livelihood by the needle , and the other will ere long add some homeless or neglected one to her household to train up for the kingdom of heaven . In the same neighborhood are a physician and his wife , working in the same Christian spirit and self- denying economy . A sick , homeless young girl comes to them for counsel and aid . They take her in , cure her , and give her healthful domestic labor . Then they train her to be an intelligent , agreeable , conscientious nurse for the sick . After practicing in this employment a while , and thus supporting herself , they lend her money to secure time for study and medical lectures , and at last they see her a valued physician to her own sex in a flourishing Health Establishment , with a liberal salary , from which she refunds to her benefactors all they have loaned , that they may again employ it for the destitute . A second invalid comes to them , is cured , trained for a nurse , provided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a few years becomes a successful physician , and returns the funds she received . A third comes for similar aid , and in due time rises to be an accomplished and honored physician in one of the largest and wealthiest female institutions of the country . All this , and much more , has been accomplished by selfdenying indastry and economy wisely applied . Had they adopted the style of living of many of their associates , and which was at their command , all which they have thus employed for the destitute would have been spent in self-gratification . In the same circle is seen a woman with delicate health and a small income . Had she economized and hoarded for herself she could have built a tasteful cottage near her family friends , and laid up bank-stock for support in old age . Instead of this , while aiming to dress and to live in a style of neatness and good taste that would not offend even the fastidious , it was done with an ingenuity and economy that enabled her to live at one-fourth the personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was constantly rescuing one after another from ignorance and sin . Had she laid up for herself she would , at the close of life , count perishable house and bank-stock as the result of life 's labor . But , instead of this , she will he able to count many immortal minds by her ministries " turned to righteousness , " among whom she will " shine as the firmament , and as the stars for ever and ever . " When asked , " Who will provide for coming infirmities and old age ? the reply is , " The Lord will provide while she well understands that multitudes to whom she has ministered would rejoice in the privilege to minister to her in return . In the same circle sometimes appears a young person who is an only daughter of parents of moderAte means . When her school education was complete , at her earnest entreaties , and with promises of diligence and economy , she was allowed to take a little girl from the hands of parents both of them intemperate and miserably poor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to perform properly all domestic duties , and chiefly by her young ben*-factress , by whom also she was trained to a religious life , and brought to confirmation as the sponsor . And now , in married life , she is rewarded by the most devoted service and affection of her protdgde in all the varied services of the family state . In another case a young couple , just beginning married life , instead of an expensive boarding-house life take humble rooms , and a young girl who is trained by both in book knowledge and domestic arts , and thus becomes their lifelong cultivated friend and helper . The above are all examples taken from circles of such moderate resources that such benevolent ministries could be secured only by self-denying industry and strict , systematic economy . To these examples among those of moderate means may be added some from among the wealthy : A lady of great wealth , high position , and elegant culture , in one of our large cities , hired and furnished a house adjacent to her own , and securing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orphan girls , of different ages , were taken and educated under their joint care . Not only time and money were given , but love and labor , just as if these were their own children , and as fast as one was provided for another was taken . In another city a young lady , with property of her own , hired a house and made it a home for homeless and unprotected young women , who paid board when they could earn it , and found a refuge when out of employment . In another city the wife of one of its richest merchants , and living in princely style , took two young girls from the certain road to ruin among the vicious poor . She boarded them with a respectable farmer , and sent them to school , and every week went out , not only to supervise but to aid in training them to habits of neatness , industry , and obedience , just as if they were her own children . Next she hired a large house near the most degraded part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , and then rented to those among the most degraded whom she could bring to conform to a few simple rules of decency , industry , and benevolence - one of these rules being that they should pay her the rent every Saturday night . To this motley gathering she became chief counselor and friend , quieted their brawls , taught them to aid each other in trouble or sickness , and strove to introduce among them that law of patient love and kindness illustrated by her own example . The young girls in this tenement she assembled every Saturday at her own house-taught them to sing , heard them recite their Sunday-school lessons , to be sure they were properly learned ; taught them to // make and mend their own clothing herself , trimmed their bonnets , and took charge of their Sunday dress , that it might always be in order . Of course such benevolence drew a stream of ignorance and misery to her door ; and so successful was her labor that she hired a second house , and managed it on the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her combing the head of a poor , ungainly foreign girl . She had persuaded a friend to take her from compassion , and she was returned because her head was in such a state . Finding no one else to do it , the lady herself bravely met the difficulty , and persevered in this daily ministry till the evil was remedied , and the poor girl thus secured a comfortable home and wages . In this same city a lady invested most of her property in a " Home for lucurables , " where she daily ministers to these hopeless sufferers . A young lady of wealth and position , with great musical culture and taste , found among the poor two young girls with fine voices and great musical talent . Gaining her parents ' consent she took one of them home , trained her in music herself saw that her school training was secured , and when expensive masters and instruments were needed she earned the money required as a governess in a f:imily of wealthy friends . Then she aided the sister ; and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of wealth , and the other is receiving a large income as a popular musical artist . Another young girl , educated as a fine musician by her wealthy parents , at the age of sixteen was afflicted with weak eyes and a heart complaint . She strove to solace herself by benevolent ministries . By teaching music to the children of wealthy friends she earned the means to relieve and instruct the suffering ignorant and poor . We *vi1l now suppose such a tract of land is purchased by a few benevolent individuals , and laid out on the plan indicated , houses erected for families of different sizes , in which domestic labor can be performed with economy and good taste ; garden plots laid out , a common laundry , bakery , cook-shop , and stables provided ( which all can use or not at choice ) , and finally , a superintendent of skill , taste , and energy to manage . Then the aim would be to collect a certain number of families on these grounds , or the immediate vicinity , of congenial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise all within their reach to equal advantages with their own ; or , in other words , to carry out the great command , " Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself . " The mode to adopt would be to have each family perfectly independent , and yet a systematic division of labor be aimed at , by which each household should strive to carry out some one department of literary , or aesthetic , or domestic culture , which should be extended to all in the neighborbood wishing to secure it . The following indicates persons known to the writer prepared to unite in such an undertaking : VOL . XXXLV. - No. 203. -Q Q A lady with about $8000 at her cousmand has great taste and experience in gardening and floriculture . She could rent one of the smallest houses , and hire from one of the adjacent tenement-houses a boy to live with her on trial . When a suitable one is thus found she could have him bound to her for a term of years , and then train him for the profession of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . When qualified to become her assistant , she could take another boy from the tenement-houses , or elsewhere , and make the family a self-supporting establishment , by supplying the market close at hand . Another lady , with a large family and frequent visitors , might , in one of the largest houses , take as her associate a woman of culture and refinement , with requisite domestic experience , and then receive three or four women of good character to train for the highest class of servants , and , when they are duly qualified , find places for them with wages proportioned to their superior character . When one completes her ' course another could be received in her l ) lace . Another lady with both literary and domestic tastes and culture , and a small income , could take an associate to aid and receive a certain number of daughters from wealthy families , to be trained in the family till they are fully qualified to instruct others in all domestic duties . With the income from the wealthy thus earned , she might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if they were her children . Another lady , with a handsome property of her own and a husband in good business , has no children . Possessing a great love of children and an indulgent husband , she might take a governess as her assistant , and then adopt orphans to the extent of her means and benevolence . Another lady of moderate means has been led to feel great sympathy for the homeless aged and sick . She could hire one of these dwellings , and take a few who could afford to pay well , and then seek those fitted by tastes and habits to be nurses of the sick , and train them for this office . Then , by finding places where they would receive liberal pay for their high qualifications , she might receive a portion as compensation for her labor , and thus her family be self-supporting . Another lady , who has a taste and talent for this department , might seek a congenial associate and form a family to train as seamstresses and dress-makers , and at the same time instruct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be made self-supporting . Another friend of the writer has three orphan nieces and their fortune left to her care . With a congenial asso9iate she might rent another house , and add to her family some homeless orphans . Several other ladies of wealth , living almost in solitary grandeur , might follow in the same ministry to orphans . Some fifty families might be thus located , and such a neighborhood might sustain both a // When several families form a neighborhood the same rule is binding .

None can deny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become irreclaimably selfish , and live forever severed from the good , and thus reap the natural results of selfishness in a world by themselves . And he taught that men are to be saved from this doom by his followers , and that the number of those saved depends on their self-sacmficing labors . There are those who not only profess to believe this fundamental truth , but who daily make it the regulating principle . Such believe that the way to lay up treasures for children , as well as for self , is not to invest in stocks and lands , but to spend all to serve men , and for self and family only as tends to this chief end . Their hearts ( that is , their chief interests ) are set on thus laying up treasures in heaven , and all questions of practical duty are so regulated . Thus , as to dress-Is this the style that will give most influence and means for the best good of my fellow-men ? As to amusements-Will this add strength and ability to work to serve men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that will afford most time and means to spend for the salvation of men from ignorance and sin ? The difference between such as these and the worldly Christian is as great as between men on a party of pleasure at sea and men who , in nn awful storm , are struggling to save as many us possible from a sinking ship . It is such as these who are described in Holy Writ as " a peculiar people . " It is such as these who have learned by experience that the highest and noblest happiness is bought by " sacrifice . " Such have often reported that the most satisfying hours of purest enjoyment have been in the ministries of war , amidst toil and suffer. * ing and cares never known before . And it was not alone the happiness of comforting the sorrowful and relieving the suffering . It was still more the high inspiration of a grand and noble cause . It is thus our minds are created to be made happy in toiling for a noble cause-in sacrificing se ! f to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to has been to direct attention to the true field of labor for American women in *nultiplying healthful homes , where the young shall be trained to work for others , and by a well-devised economy of time , labot , and expense that shall secure all the real advantages of a high civilization . The profusion and waste of American housekeepers , in contrast with the economy and thrift of the French and German , is a topic of frequent remark by sojourners abroad . This serious defect in American housekeeping is owing , in part , to our great abundance ; next , to the fact that young women are not trained for their special duty as housekeepers ; and , lastly , to the neglect of this matter as a sacred and religious duty . That economy in expenses is a religious duty has rarely been urged on the conscience from the pulpit or the press . Nor can it be made to appear in this light except to those who assume the high obligations of the religion of Christ , based on the dangers and risks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice the extremest seif-snerifice , if need be to the loss of all things , in order to save their fellow-men . With this solemn and sacred aim the truly Christian woman saves in small concerns , that she may add , not to self-indulgences , but to her means for aiding to elevate and save her fellowcreatures . It is this view alone that imparts dignity and duty to a wise Christian economy . It is this high ideal which may transform a home into the temple *tJ*e Lord , its work-room to the inner sanctuary , anfic its cooking apparatus to an altar of sacrifice , where the young shall be trained to offer their appetites and selfish indulgences a holy sacrifice to God for the good of their fellow-men .

For as our country advances in wealth the demand for servants will increase , while the number of women who go out to hired service will decrease . This article presents the plan of a house for persons of more limited means , desicned to secure pure air and economy of time , labor , and expense . The chief features to be noticed are 1 . The close packing of conveniences , to save time , steps , and labor . 2 . A system of ventilation securing pure air to every room by night and day , without care or attention . 3 . A method of avoiding the smells and heat of cooking . 4 . A tasteful and agreeable work-room , banishing many disagreeable associations of ordinary kitchens . 5 . Most of the comforts and conveniences of expensive establishments demanding sevenil 0 a 0 0 C C // servants , and yet at a moderate expense , and so arranged that parents and children can easily accomplish all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laundry . The elevation for this plan is seen at the head of this article . The ornamental windows and doors add but little to the expense , if built of brick . Where close economy is required plain doors and windows can be substituted , and the bow window and conservatory omitted or deferred . The Gothic elevation given in the article in this Magazine for May , 1866 , can , with slight changes , be used for this plan . The plan for the cellar is drawn and described sufficiently in that article . The plan on page 581 gives the ground-floor and the chambers in the second story , which is under a French roof . If more rooms are wanted another story can be added . In this ground-plan will first be noticed the close packing of conveniences . In the entrance-hall the corners behind the front-doors are fitted with arched recesses , supplied with hooks for outer garments , an umbrellastand , and boxes or low shelves for over-shoes . On each side of the staircase are niches for busts or flowers or lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-places in the parlor and sitting-room , where books , work , and ornamental articles can be arranged . Arched recesses also are found in the corners of these rooms for similar uses . Appended to the parlor is a small room , to be ventilated by a wood or tin conductor ( 12 by 9 inches ) under the floor , leading to the ventilating flue . This room has a water-closet and small wardrobe or closet in two corners . It can be used for a retiring-room , for rest and quiet while at work ; or for cases of sickness , to save steps and labor ; or for a sewing-room close by the parlor ; or for a servant 's room , when one is needed . The Work-Room should have the floors , shelves , and drawers all made of oiled pine or white wood , which can be kept clean with very little labor . The Ventilating Stove-Closet , with its roof and sliding or rising doors , is described in page 769 of May Number for 1866 . The castiron stove-pipe fastened into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current of warm air is created , and every room that has an opening into this flue is constantly having its impure air carried off . In this plan of a house every room and water-closet can have a ventilating conductor under the floor or at the top of the room , connecting either with this warmair flue or with a flue uniting with it . All the sides of the Work-Room should have shelves reaching to the wall , with sliding-doors running on shieves , so as to pass each other . So , also , the Stove-Closet should have similar shelves to the wall , with sliding doors , where the stove-furniture and most of the common articles used in cooking are to be placed . The upper shelves are to receive the articles least frequently used . The Cooking-Form described and drawn in the previous article , page 767 , is to he placed in this Work-Room . There is no one thing so important to a housekeeper , as it respects success , comfort , and economy , as to know how to select and to manage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all American housekeepers were trained to do this , and then would train their children and servants to use them properly , many millions now given to ignorant or careless waste would be saved . And there is no direction in which the scient*/ic training of women to economy can be more wisely directed . The laws that regulate the creation , preservation , and diffusion of heat as yet are a sealed mystery to thousands of young women who are spending so many hours over French , music , Latin , and the " higher branches , " in a course of study from which most that is to be practical in *voman s after-life is wholly excluded . If the Work-Room , the Stove-Closet , the passage to the cellar , and two forms each side of the cellar-stairs , are provided with shelves , as they may be , every article ever used for work in eating-room and kitchen can be stored in and around the work-room , and also all the stores for cooking . Thus every thing needed can be reached with the fewest possible steps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closets . The use of corners in rooms and of slidingdoors in small rooms is an important item in the economy of space , expense , and labor . This will be seen in the plan of the chambers . Instead of bureaus , wardrobes , and washstands which project into a room , will be seen dressing-tables and closets in the corners , thus giving space to the useful portions of a room . This drawing gives a view of a corner dressing-table and bureau . The lower portion has drawers , and each side small closets , with shoecases fastened to the inside of the doors , and small shelves to hold stockings . The upper portion recedes a foot or more , and the arched recess is for a looking-glass on a standard . Each side are small closets for articles used in dressing . Oyer the arched recess are two deep closets to hold bandboxes , etc . The two large chambers open to a store-room bountifully supplied with hooks for hanging dresses , and drawers to the wall for storing linen and other family articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so as to make a small closet in which to lock family stores . One item of health and comfort is specially commended to notice , and that is the size and position of the beds in the larger chambers . In Germany and France double beds are seldom seen . Instead of this , sin* , le beds , exactly fitting to each other , are made to stand apart or close together , as may be desired . Thus the danger and evils of having the aged sleep with young children , the sick sleep with the well , the nervous and sleepless disturbing a nervous and weak companion , the infant disturbing both parents in one bed-these and many other evils are thus avoided . *IPhe advance of civilization in this country will hasten reform in this important particular . The hanging of doors as marked in the drawing is important , so as to protect those by the fire from draughts . Low window-sills add to the beauty of a room , as high ones give an imprisoned air . Every room should have at least one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he DRAWERS 0 C a a I 0 ) // gloomy . For this reason piazzas and porticoes make lower rooms gloomy , unless one window admits light from the sky . The Water-Closets should be ventilated by tin or wood conductors to the ventilating flue . Cautions as to their construction on p. 771 of the May article are important . The staircase runs to a broad stair and then divides , so as to give more room to the adjacent chamber . The Water-Closets can be supplied by a tank in the garret , with a forcing pump to a well or cisteru in the cellar . Care must be taken to have this tank well supported by timbers or partitions underneath , and also to have the plumbing and waste-pipe properly done . The expense of water.closets but little exceeds that of outdoor accommodations , while they greatly add to health and comfort .
