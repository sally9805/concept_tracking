Rocks Rocks Eat ! you are always talking about something to eat . I never saw such a man as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every two or three months you are always grumbling . Jake Jake I ca n't live on air . Rocks Rocks Why , you ungrateful scoundrel , it was only a week ago that I gave you something to eat . Jake Jake What was it ? Rocks Rocks What was it ! why , did n't I give you a pea-nut only a week ago ? Jake Jake Yes , but I do n't want any pea-nuts . I want a good warm meal , some hash  --  some corned beef and cabbage . I want something that will stay there . Rocks Rocks Look at me ; see how I stand it . Jake Jake Well , you see , you are more robust . You 're more used to it . Rocks Rocks Pointing to Musicians . Do you see those gentlemen over there ? They are musicians . Now watch me ; I 'm going to strike them for a job . Jake Jake No , no ; strike them for something to eat . Rocks Rocks Hush ! Fixes shirt-collar , buttons up coat , stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the talking . Gentlemen , excuse me for interrupting you ; I will claim your attention but for a moment . Gentlemen , you see before you two dilapidated specimens of humanity , but it is really not our fault , I assure you . We are not natives of your country , we are Hinglishmen , jolly Hinglishmen from merry Hingland . We came over , sir , in the " Great Eastern , " in fact , we walked about two-thirds of the way , and after arriving here upon your hospitable shores , we met some of our friends from home , who recommended us to go to a place they called Pike 's Peak . They said that Pike 's Peak was a very beautiful country , and looking at my friend and seeing that he was an invalid , they said the salubrity of the climate would recuperate my friend 's health , and bring him up to the stamina of a man that he was when we left home ; they also said that at Pike 's Peak gold and silver grew in abundance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there little pieces of gold and silver with impunity , take them home and exhibit them to our friends as great curiosities coming from America , and in climbing over the rugged rocks and through the base caverns to obtain these treasures , we somewhat disarranged our wardrobe , which causes us to appear in the sad plight which your ogles will witness if you will let them light upon us at the present time . After this speech ( which is delivered as rapidly as possible and almost without taking breath ) he walks back to Jake and exclaims :  --  How was that , Jake ? Jake Jake That was all very fine , but you never said eat once . Rocks Rocks You do n't understand ; those were only the preliminaries . Jake Jake Yes , but you are too long on the prelims . Come to the eat . Rocks Rocks Now , then , it 's your turn . You must go talk to them . Jake Jake Me ! I ca n't talk . I 'm too weak ; I ca n't breathe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , straighten up and throw out your chest . Jake Jake That was thrown out a week ago . What will I say to them ? Rocks Rocks O , say anything , only give them to understand that you are a gentleman . Jake Jake They can see that . Jake fixes himself , turns round two or three times , showing his ragged clothes , then asks Rocks how he looks ; he says first-rate . He then approaches the gentleman who is back to stage , and reaching out with his umbrella , touches him on the shoulder . Man takes no notice at first , but finally turns and says  --  Man Man What do you wish , sir ? Jake Jake Could I have a few weeks ' conversation with you ? Man Man Yes , sir , with pleasure . They both walk down to foot-lights . Jake is very backward , and keeps looking to Rocks for encouragement . Jake looks at the gentleman as though he thought he would not condescend to converse with him ; reaches out his hand a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand . Jake seizes and shakes it , drops hand , then seizes and shakes it again . This business is kept up as long as good judgment requires . Jake Jake I 'm very glad to meet you , sir . I hope you are well . Man Man Quite well , sir . Shakes hand . Jake Jake I am not so well , sir . Shakes hand . You see , sir , I am a gentleman . I 'm from one of the first families of the nation . My father rode in his own carriage , aside swill-cart , aloud , pointing to Rocks . This gentleman took me from my happy home , and said he would make a man of me . Turning himself round . You see how he has succeeded . I hope you are well , sir . Shakes hand . Are you a married man ? Rocks stamps his foot and tries to check him . Man Man I am very happy to say I am a married man . Jake Jake Do you go home early nights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sometimes detained rather late . Rocks Rocks Going up to Jake , cautiously . Talk to him about business . Jake Jake Yes , sir . Turning to Man . Do you want to buy a nice dog ? Man Man No , sir . Jake Jake You seem to be perfectly healthy . Do you eat three meals a day ? Man Man We have three meals and a lunch . Jake Jake We do n't have so much  --  could n't you take me home to dinner with you ? Rocks pulls Jake away . Man goes to his seat , and everybody excited . Rocks R ocks You 've ruined everything . Jake Jake No , you are mistaken ; I had just come to the eat . Rocks Rocks Eat ! Would n't you be a nice-looking thing to sit at that gentleman 's table ? Jake Jake I do n't know how I would look , but I know I 'd feel well . Rocks Rocks Goes over to Man . Gentlemen , I owe you an apology for my young friend . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little touched in the upper story . Jake Jake Putting hands on stomach . No , sir , I 'm touched in the lower story . Rocks Rocks And another thing : While we were up at Pike 's Peak my friend went out very early one morning and unfortunately got sun-struck . Jake Jake Yes , and now I 'm grub-struck . Rocks Rocks But , gentlemen , if you will deign to make our acquaintance , you will find us gentlemen of the first water . Jake Jake Dirty water . Rocks Rocks We are musicians , sir . We were educated at the Conservatoire of Paris . Man Man Have you your instruments with you ? Rocks Rocks Yes , sir , they are out in our carriage . I 'll get them . Goes out r .

Will you do me the honor to dine with me to-day ? Rocks Rocks With the greatest pleasure , I assure you . Walks very dignified to l. corner of stage . Jake picks up things and goes over to Man , smiling . Jake Jake What time did you say we dined , sir ? Man Man We dine at four , sir , but I did not invite you , I invited your friend . You do n't dine with us . Jake Jake I do n't ? Man Man No , sir ; you are not invited . Jake goes over to Rocks , almost crying , and pulls him by the sleeve . Jake Jake Rocks , fix it ; that man says I do n't dine with you . Rocks Rocks I do n't know you , sir . I dine with this gentleman . How dare you address me in this familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do your country some good , and not be wandering around the streets , looking like a pauper . To Musicians .

Rocks Rock s Very much taken back , to Jake . I 'll fix it all right . Gentlemen , this is my very worthy and esteemed friend , Major Jakes . As he told you just now , we sing together , and play duetts . Would you like to hear a duett ? All All Very much , indeed . They play a duett with old clarionet and penny trumpet . While they are performing , one Musician gets club , another a bladder blown up and tied to a stick , and with them they beat them off the stage . Back matter The End .               @ @ @ @ @ @
