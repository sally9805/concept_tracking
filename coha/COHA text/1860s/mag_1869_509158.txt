txt THE BISHOPS OF ROME . IN her faded magnificence Rome still possesses the most imposing of earthly empires . She rules over nearly two hundred millions of the human race . Her well - ordered army of l ) riests , both regular and secular , arrayed almost with the precision of a Roman legion , and governed by a single will , carry the standard of St. Peter to the farthest bounds of civilization , and cover the whole earth with a chain of influences radiating from the central city . The Pope is still powerful in Europe and America , Africa and the East . He disturbs the policy of England , and sometimes governs that of France ; his influence is felt in the revolutions of Mexico and the elections of New York . Hemmed in by the Greek Church on the eastward , engaged in a constant struggle with the Protestantism of the north , and trembling for his ancestral dominions in the heart of Italy itself , the supreme Pontiff still gallantly summons around him his countless priestly legions , and thunders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if to maintain before the eyes of mankind a semblance of supernatural splendor , the Popes have invented and perfected at Rome a ritual more magnificent than was ever known before . In the Basilica of St. Peter , the largest and most costly building ever erected by man , the annual pomp of the Romish ceremonies exceeds the powers of description . The gorgeous robe , s , the plaintive music , the assembled throng of princes , cardinals , and priests , the various rites designed to paint in living colors the touching memorials of the Saviours life and death , delight or impress the inquisitive and the devout . And when at length the Holy Father , parent of all the faithful , appears upon the balcony of St. Peter 's and bestows his blessing upon mankind , few turn away unaffected by the splendid spectacle , untouched by the peculiar fascination of the magnificent Church of Rome . Very different , however , in character and appearance was that early church which the Popes claim to represent . The Jewish Christians entered pagau Rome probably about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the capital of the Roman Empire and of the world . Its population was more than a million ; its temples , baths , and public buildings were still complete in their magnificence ; its streets were filled with a splendid throng of senators , priests , and nobles ; its palaces were scenes of unexampled luxury ; and literature and the fine arts still flourished , although with diminished lustre . But the moral condition of Rome during the reigns of Claudius and Nero shocked even the unrefined consciences of Juvenal and Persius . A cold , dull sensuality pervaded all ranks of the people ; the intellect was enchained by spells more gross and foul than the enchantments of Comus ; crime kept pace with sensuality , and the palaces of emperors and senators were stained with horrible deeds that terrified even the hardened sentiment of Rome . At length Nero became a raging madman . He murdered his mother , his friends , and his kinsmen . Seneca and Lucan , the literary glories of the age , died at his command . To forget his fearful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a bacchanal through the streets of the city ; he sang upon the stage amidst the dissolute throng of mimics and actors , and his horrible debauchery was mingled with a cruelty that almost surpasses belief . The people of Rome were little less corrupt than their emperor . Honor , integrity , and moral purity were mocked at and contemned by the degraded descendants of Cicero and Cato , and the keen satire of Juvenal has thrown a shameful immortality upon the vicious and criminal of his contemporaries . Gain was the only aim of the Romans . The husband sold his honor , the parent his child , friend betrayed friend , wives denounced their husbands to win the means of a luxurious subsistence . The amusements of the people , too , were well fitted to instruct them in licentiousness and crime . Thousands of wretched gladiators died in the arena to satisfy the Roman thirst for blood ; gross and licentious pantomimes had supplanted on the stage the tragedies of Accius and the comedies of Terence ; the witty but indecent epigrams of Martial were beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the philosophic Seneca , plunged in the luxury of his palaces and villas , wrote in vain his defense of the matricide of Nero . // It was into such a city that the obscure missionaries from Jerusalem made their way , about the middle of the first century , bearing to unhappy Rome the earliest tidings of the gospel of peace . St. Peter is said to have become Bishop of Rome in the year 42 . Amidst the splendid throng of consulars , knights , and nobles , he wandered an obscure and unknowfl stranger . The first Bishop of Rome , clothed in coarse and foreign garb and mingling with the lowest classes of the people , was scarcely noticed by the dissolute courtiers of Nero or that literary opposition which was inspired by the vigorous honesty of the satirists and poets . Yet Christianity seems to have made swift though silent progress . Within thirty years from the death of its author a church had already been gathered at Rome , and the simple worship of the early Christians was celebrated under the shadow of the Capitol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in obscure portions of the city ; the exhortations of the Apostles were heard with eager interest by the lower orders of the Romans ; a new hope dawned upon the oppressed and the obscure , and it is said that a large number of the earlier converts were slaves . Little is known of the condition of the Church at this period , yet we may properly infer that its congregations were numerous , and that the voice of praise and prayer was heard issuing from many an humble dwelling of the crowded and dissolute city . Amidst the shouts and groans of the blood-stained arena , and the wild revels of the streets and the palaces , the Je*vish teachers inculcated to eager assemblies lessons of gentleness and love . Suddenly , however , a terrible light is thrown upon the condition of the early Church of Rome . Nero began his famous persecution , and the severe pen of the historian Tacitus bears witness to the wide and rapid growth of the obscure faith . " The founder of the sect , Christ , " says the pagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the procurator , Pontius Pilate. rhe pernicious superstition , repressed for a time , burst forth again ; not only through Juden , the birth-place of the evil , but at Rome also , where every thing atrocious and base centre.s and is in repute . " Rome had lately been desolated by a great fire , which Nero was believed to have ordered to be kindled in one of his moments of insane merriment ; and to remove suspicion from himself the Emperor charged the Christians with an attempt to burn the city . Those first arrested , says Tacitus , confessed their guilt ; vast numbers were put to death ; some were clad in the skins of wild beasts and were torn to pieces by dogs ; others were affixed to crosses , and , being covered with some inflammable material , were burned at night , in the place of torches , to dispel the darkness . Nero lent his gardens for the hideous spectacle , the populace of Rome crowded to the novel entertainment , and the Emperor , driving his own chariot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charioteer . In the last year of the reign of this monster St. Peter and St. Paul are believed to have suffered martyrdom at Rome , and to have been buried in the spots now marked by the two noble Basilicas that bear their names . From this period ( 67 ) the new and powerful sect became a constant object of imperial persecution . The Christians were denounced as the common enemies of mankind . The grossest crimes , the foulest superstitions , were charged against them . The learned Romans looked upon them with contempt as a vulgar throng of deluded enthusiasts . Pliny speaks of them with gentle scorn ; the wise Trajan and the philosophic Aurelius united in persecuting them ; and Decius and Diocletian sought to extirpate every vestige of the hated creed . Six great persecutions are noticed by the historians , from that of Nero to that of Maximin and Diodetian , during which the whole civilized world every where witnessed the constancy and resignation of the Christian martyrs . It was the age of martyrdom . An infinite number of novel tortures were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unresisting victims . Some were affixed to crosses and left to starve ; some were suspended by the feet , and hung with their heads downward until they died ; some were crushed beneath heavy weights ; some beaten to death with iron rods ; some were cast into caldrons of blazing oil ; some were thrown , bound , into dungeons to be eaten by mice ; some were pierced with sharp knives ; and thousands died in the arena , contending with wild beasts , to amuse the populace of Rome . The mildest punishment awarded to the Christians was to labor in the sand-pits , or to dig in the distant mines of Sardinia and Spain . Men , women , and children , the noble convert or the faithful slave , suffered a common doom , and were exposed to tortures scarcely equaled by the poetic horrors of Dante 's terrible Inferno . Yet the honors paid to these early martyrs in a later age were almost as extravagant as their sufferings had been severe . The city which had been consecrated by their tortures deemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ martyrs , sang Pmdentius , has made holy the fair city of Saragossa . Splendid churches were built over the graves of obscure victims ; the bones of the martyrs were looked upon as the most precious relics ; they were enchased in gold and covered with jewels ; they wrought miracles , healed the sick , and brought prosperity and good fortune ; and the humblest Christian who had been racked with sharp knives or hung with his head downward , in the days of pagan persecution , was now deified , worshiped , and almost adored . It was during the reign of the early persecution that the bishops and the Church of Rome sought , and perhaps found , a refuge in that singular hiding-place  --  the Catacombs . Beneath the Campagna , immediately around the city , the earth is penetrated by a great number of galleries or tunnels , running for many miles // under the surface , and difficult of access even to those most familiar with them . These narrow passages are now known as the Catacombs , and are usually four or six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed by the Romans in getting out sand for cement ; and as many of the Christians were laborers or slaves , they were probably well acquainted with the opportunity for concealment offered by these arenaria ? , or sand-pits , where they had often labored at their humble toil . When persecution grew fierce , and the life of every Christian was in danger , the Church of Rome hid itself in the Catacombs . 1-lere , in these dismal passages , may still be seen a thousand traces of the sufferings and sorrows of the early Christians . Here are small chapels cut in the sides of the wall of sand , and provided with altars , fonts , and episcopal chairs , while above the chapel a narrow opening is often excavated to the surface of the earth in order to admit a little light or air to the hidden congregation below . Other portions of the Catacombs were used as cemeteries for the burial of the Christian dead . CountJess tombs are seen rudely excavated in the earth , and usually distinguished by an inscription indicating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , form one of the most interesting traits of the Catacombs , and have been eagerly studied and copied by many ardent explorers . They bring into clear light the simplicity and fervor of the ancient faith . Here are no prayers for the dead , no address to the Virgin or the saints . Upon one tomb is written , " He sleeps in Christ ; " over another , " May she live in the Lord Jesus ! " Most of the inscriptions dwell upon the hope of a better life , and are full of resignation and faith . One , however , shows in what gloom and terror the Church maintained its existence . " Oh , mournful time , " it reads , " in which prayer and sacred rites , even in caverns , afford no protection ! " The bishops of Rome , with their terrified followers , were now the tenants of a subterranean home . They lived among tombs , in darkness and confinement , fed upon the scanty food brought them by stealth by faithful slaves or devoted women . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but few of the early bishops escaped martyrdom . They were pursued into the Catacombs , and were often murdered in the midst of their congregations . Stephen I. , Bishop of Rome , lived many years , it is said , in these dismal retreats . Food was furnished him from above , and wells and springs are found in the Catacombs . At length , however , the pagan soldiers traced him to his chapel , while he was performing service , and , when he had done , threw him back in his episcopal chair and cut off his head at a blow . The pagan emperors in vain issued decrees forbidding the Christians from taking refuge in the Catacombs , and , although death was decreed to every one who was found there , these endless labyrinths were always thickly peopled . Ladies of rank hid in the sand-pits and were fed by their faithful maids ; the rich and the poor found a common safety in the recesses of the earth . When the heathen soldiers approached the Christians would sometimes block up the passages with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the labyrinth where the persecutors did not venture to follQw them . Long afterward , when all necessity for using them had forever passed away , the Catacombs were still looked upon with singular veneration by the Roman Christians as the scene of many a martyrdom and the home of the persecuted Church . Here they would often assemble to celebrate their holiest rites , surrounded by the tombs of bishops and presbyters , and shut out from the world in the gloom of a subterranean darkness . St. Jerome relates that it was his custom when a young student at Rome to wander on Sundays to the Catacombs , accompanied by his pious friends , descend into a deep cavern amidst the cultivated fields near the city , and enter by a path of winding steps the hallowed abode of the martyrs . His pious pilgrimage represents , no doubt , the common practice of the Christians of his time . But as centuries passed away the ancient usage was neglected , until at length even the very existen*e of the Catacombs was forgotten . It was only remembered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cemeteries , and that the living had once been forced to seek shelter among the dead . In the year 1578 Rome was startled by the intelligence that an ancient Christian cemetery had been discovered , extending like a subterranean city around and beneath the Salarian Way . The Roman antiquarians and artists crowded to the spot , explored with earnest devotion the crumbling labyrinth , copied the numerous inscriptions , traced the mouldering sculptures or the faded pictures upon the walls , and revived the memory of the forgotten Church of the Catacombs . During this period of persecution and contempt the bishops of Rome gave little promise of that spiritual and temporal grandeur to which they afterward attained . They are nearly lost to history ; a barren list of names is ahnost all that we possess . Yet the discovery of the writings of Hyppolytus has lately thrown some new light upon the characters of several of the early bishops , and serves to show that the rulers of the Church were not always selected with discretion . Bishop Victor was stern , haughty , and overbearing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and venal . But the next bishop , who ruled from 219 to 223 , was even less rel ) utable than his predecessors . Callistus , in early life , had been a slave in the family of Carpophorus , a wealthy Christian who was employed in the Emperor 's household . His master established Callistus as a banker in a business quarter of the city , and his bank was soon filled with the savings of prudent Christians and the property of widows and orphans . Callistus made away with the funds intrusted // qwq early wildness , and forced European intellect to begin anew i*ts slow progress toward supremacy . No part of the civilized world suffered more severely than its capital . Alaric entered Rome lighted by the flames of its finest quarters ; Genseric swept away almost its entire population . Famine , pestilence , and war fell upon the Eternal City . The numbers of its people decreased from one million to less than fifty thousand ! A few plague-stricken and impoverished citizens wandered amidst its vast and still splendid ruins ; the elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of letters , the luxurious nobles , and the factious people had been carried away into slavery , or had died of plague or famine ; and the Christian fathers , when they would convey to their auditors a clear conception of the Judgment-day , the final dissolution of all things earthly , would compare it to the fate of Rome . The bishops of Rome , during this eventful period , became the protectors and preservers of the city . Their sacred office was still respected by the Arian Goths and Vandals ; the large revenues of the Church were applied to providing food for the starving people ; and it is possible that suffering and humiliation had once more awakened something of the purity of early Christianity in the minds of both priest and laity . The bishops , too , were sometimes the victims of wars or civil convulsions . Pope John , imprisoned as a traitor by the Ostrogothic King Theodoric , languished and died in confinement . Silverius was deposed , exiled , and perhaps murdered , by that meekest of heroes , Belisarius , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter was rudely summoned to the Pincian Palace , the military quarters of Belisarius . In the chamber of the conqueror sat Antonina on the bed with her patient husband at her feet . " What have we done to you , Pope Silverius , " exclaimed the imperious woman , " that you should betray us to the Goths ? " In an instant the pall was rent from the shoulders of the unhappy Pope , he was hurried into another room , stripped of his dress and clothed in the garb of a simple monk , and his deposition was proclaimed to the clergy of Rome . He was afterward given up to the power of his rival and successor , Vigilius , who banished him to the island of Pandataria , and is supposed to have finally procured his death . Stained with crime , a false witness and a murderer , Vigilius had obtained his holy office through the power of two profligate women who now ruled the Roman world . Theodora , the dissolute wife of Justinian , and Antonina , her devoted servant , assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . Vigilius failed to satisfy the exacting demands of his casuistical mistresses ; he even ventured to differ from them upon some obscure points of doctrine . His punishment soon followed , and the Bishop of Rome is said to have been dragged through the streets of Constantinople with a rope around his neck , to have been imprisoned in a common dungeon and fed on bread and water . The papal chair , filled by such unworthy occupants , must have sunk low in the popular esteem , had not Gregory the Great , toward the close of the sixth century , revived the dignity of the office . Gregory was a Roman , of a wealthy and illustrious family , the grandson of Pope Felix II . Learned , accomplished , a fine speaker , a sincere Christian , in his youth he eclipsed all his contemporaries , was distinguished in the debates of the Senate , and finally became the governor of Rome . The Emperor , when he visited Constantinople , treated him with marked confidence , and honors and emoluments seemed to have been showered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was equally the favorite of the court and of the people , and all that the world could give lay at his command . But suddenly a startling change came over his active intellect ; the world grew cold and repulsive ; he stopped in his career of success and became a monk . He expended his wealth in founding monasteries ; he sold his gold and jewels , his silken robes and tasteful furniture , and lavished the proceeds upon the poor . He resigned his high offices , and having entered a monastery which he had founded at Rome , performed the menial duties for his fellow-monks . His body was emaciated by terrible fastings and vigils , his health gave way , and his life hung by a single thread . The prayers of a pious companion alone snatched him from an early grave . From this severe discipline Gregory rose up a half-maddened enthusiast . Angels seemed to float around him wherever he moved ; demons fled at his approach . His monastery of St. Andrew , over which he became the abbot , was the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angels clustered around his holy seat . One of the monks who had passed his whole time in singing psalms , when he died was covered with white flowers by invisible hands , and the fragrance of flowers for many years afterward arose from his tomb . Yet , like many enthusiasts , Gregory was capable of acts of excessive cruelty , and his convent was ruled with unsparing severity . Justus , the monk , who was also a physician , had watched over Gregory during a long sickness with affectionate tenderness . He was himself seized with a mortal illness , and when he was dying confessed with bitter contrition that , contrary to the rules of the monastery , he had hoarded up three pieces of gold . The money was found , and the guilty monk was punished with singular cruelty . Gregory would suffer no one to approach the bed of the dying man ; no sacred rites , no holy consolation , soothed the accursed spirit as it passed away . The body was cast out upon a dunghill , together with the three pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it cried out , " Thy money perish with thee ! " After Justus had lain in // torment for thirty days Gregory relented ; a mass was said for the afflicted soul , which returned to the earth to inform its companions that it had escaped from its fearful tortures . Such were the fancies of this superstitious age . Gregory was chosen Pope ( 590 ) by the united voice of the clergy , the senate , and the people of Rome , and the Emperor Maurice confirmed the election . But Gregory shrank from assuming the holy office with real alarm . He even fled in disguise into the forest , hut a pillar of fire hovering over his head hetrayed him . He was seized and carried by force to the church of St. Peter , and was there consecrated supreme Pontiff . He might well have trembled at the thought of being intrusted with the destiny of Christianity in those dark and hopeless days ; he might well have believed , as he ever did , that the end of all things was at hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a universal horror rested upon the minds of men . From his insecure eminence at Rome Gregory saw every where around him the wreck of nations and the misery of the human race . Germany was overrun by hordes of savages ; France , half-barbarian , groaned beneath the Merovingian rule ; Britain had relapsed into paganism under the Saxons ; Spain was held by the Ama Visigoths ; Africa was fast becoming a desert ; while the feeble Emperor at Constantinople was scarcely known or heard of in the dominions over which he held a nominal rule . Italy had become the prey of the fierce Lombards , and these ruthless savages plundered and desolated the peninsula from the Po to the Straits of Sicily . They massacred or sold into slavery the whole population of great cities , and made them so desolate that hermits chose their ruins as a fitting abode ; they destroyed convents , monasteries , churches , and spared neither monks nor nuns ; the very air was tainted with carnage , and the Lombards seemed never sated with bloodshed . At length , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lombard hordes approached to destroy Rome . In the midst of one of his most effective sermons the Pope was startled by the news that the enemy were at the gates ; he broke off suddenly , exclaiming , " I am weary of life ; " but he at once gave himself to the defense of the city ; the gates were closed , the crumbling walls were manned by trembling citizens , and the savage assailants retreated before the apparent vigor of the monk . Yet the environs and suburbs of the holy city were involved in a general desolation . The people were swept away into captivity , the villas , the monasteries , and the churches sank into smouldering ruins , and Gregory wept in vain over the woes ofhis unhappy people . From his ruined city Gregory began now to spread his intellectual influence over Europe . Never was there a more busy mind . He was the finest preacher of his age , and his sermons , tinged with the fierce gloom of a monastic spirit , awoke the zeal of prelates and monks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what keen attention he watched and guided the conduct of his contemporaries . He wrote in tones of persuasive gentleness to Bertha , the fair Saxon Queen of Kent , of hold cxpostulation to his nominal master , the Emperor Maurice of Constantinople ; he corresponded with the bishops and kings of France and the Visigothic rulers of Spain ; he addressed his laborious but fanciful " Dialogues " to Theodelinda , Queen of the Lombards ; he watched over the decaying churches of Africa and the feeble bishoprics of Greece ; he urged forward the conversion of England , and drove the timid Augustine to his missionary labors among the savage Saxons ; and his wonderful mental activity was finally rewarded by the complete triumph of the Romish Church . Spain , England , France , and even the wild Lombards and Arian Goths yielded to his vigorous assertion of the authority of the see of St. Peter . Gregory laid the foundation of that splendid ritual which to-day governs the services of Romish chapels and cathedrals from Vienna to Mexico , from Dublin to St. Louis . He knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his minute array of rites and ceremonies , drew together the Franks and Goths in a unison of religious observances . The world was to Gregory a vast monastery , in which perfect discipline was to he observed , and he every where enforced a strict unity of forms and conduct throughout all his great army of presbyters and monks . But it was chiefly upon the power of music that Gregory relied for softening the cruel natures of Goth and Hun . His whole ritual was one of song and melody . He was born a musician , and he impressed upon the services of the Roman Church that high excellence in musical intonation which has ever been its distinguishing trait . 1-us own choristers were renowned for their sweet voices and artistic skill , and tradition represents the austere Pope , the master intellect of his age , as sitting among his singingboys with a rod in his hand , chastising the careless and encouraging the gifted musician . The Gregorian chants indeed proved to have a singular charm for the savage races of the North . A band @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in England , and sometimes , it is related , proved more attractive than the most eloquent divines ; the Roman singing-masters , carefully instructed in Gregory 's antiphonal , became the teachers of Europe ; Chariemagne at a later period founded singing-schools in Germany upon the Gr&amp;gonan system , and was himself fond of chanting matins in his husky voice-for nature , so liberal to him in all other respects , had never designed him for a singer ; and thus music became every where the handmaid of religion , and a powerful agent in advancing the Church of Rome . A faint trace of modesty and humility still characterized the Roman bishops , and they cxpressly // disclaimed any right to the supremacy of the Christian world . The Patriarch of Constantinople , who seems to have looked with a polished contempt upon his Western brother , the tenant of fallen Rome and the bishop of the barbarians , now declared himself the Universal Bishop and the head of the subject Church . But Gregory repelled his usurpation with vigor . " Whoever calls himself Universal Bishop is Antichrist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Satan , who in his pride had aspired to be higher than the angels . Yet , reasonable as Gregory was upon many points , his boundless superstition filled the age with terrible fancies . On every side he saw countless demons threatening destruction to the elect . Hell was let loose , and the earth swarmed with its treacherous occupants . But , fortunately for the Church , it possessed a spiritual armory which no demon could resist . The relics of the saints and the bones of the martyrs were talismans insuring the perfect safety of their possessor ; and one of St. Peter 's hairs , or a filing from the chains of St. Paul , were thought gifts worthy of kings and queens . Gregory , too , had conversed with persons who had visited the realm of spirits and had been permitted to return to the earth . A soldier described such an adventure in language almost Virgilian . He passed by a bridge over a dark and noisome river , and came to an Elysian plain , filled with happy spirits clothed in white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden palace towered to the skies . Upon the bridge the visitor recognized one of his friends who had lately died , and who , as he attempted to pass , slipped , and was immediately seized by frightful demons , who strove to drag him beneath the stream ; but at the same moment angelic beings caught him in their arms , and a struggle began for the possession of the trembling soul . The result was never told . Gregory the Great died in 604 , having established the power of the Roman bishopric , and his successors assumed the title of Pope . Under Gregory the Roman see became the acknowledged head of the Western Church . The next important period in its history is the acquisition of its temporal dominions by an unscrupulous intrigue with the usurping kings of France . Various circumstances had concurred to produce this change . The Roman Church had become the representative and the chief defense of all the corruptions of the ancient faith . It adopted the worship of the Virgin and the invocation of saints , the doctrine of purgatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers ; it advocated the celibacy of the clergy ; its churches were filled with images and relics , and its superstitious laity surpassed in blind idolatry the follies of their heathen ancestors . In the mean time the followers of Mohammed , issuing from their deserts , had conquered the East , Africa , and Spain , threatened Italy itself with subjugation , and preached every where a single deity and an iconoclastic creed . While Christendom was filled with idolatry the cultivated Arabs aspired to the purest conception of the Divine nature . The contrast became so startling as to awaken a sense of shame in the breast of Leo , the Isannan , Emperor of the East . He began in 727-30 the famous iconoclastic reform ; he ordered the images to be broken to pieces , the walls of the churches to be whitewashed , and prosecuted with honest but imprudent vigor his design of extirpating idolatry . But a fierce dissension at once raged throughout all Christendom , the monks and the people rose in defense of their images and pictures , and the Emperor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heretic and a tyrant . There was an image of the Saviour , renowned for its miraculous powers , over the gate of the imperial palace called the Brazen Gate , from the rich tiles of gilt bronze that covered its magnificent vestibule ; the Emperor ordered the sacred figure to be taken down and broken to pieces . But the people from all parts of the city flew to the defense of their favorite idol , fell upon the officers , and put many of them to death . The women were even more violent than the men ; like furies they rushed to the spot , and finding one of the soldiers engaged in his unhallowed labor at the top of a ladder , they pulled it down and tore him to pieces as he lay bruised upon the ground . " Thus , " exclaims the pious annalist , " did the minister of the Emperor 's injustice fall at once from the top of a ladder to the bottom of helL " The women next flew to the great church , and finding the iconoclastic Patriarch officiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones , and a thousand opprobrious names ; he escaped bruised and fainting from the building . The guards were now called out and the female . insurrection suppressed , but not until several of the women had perished in the fray . The Pope , Gregory II. , assumed the defense of image-worship ; the Italian provinces of the Greek Emperor known as the Exarchate threw off the imperial authority rather than part with their images , and it was these provinces that finally became the patrimony of St. Peter and formed the chief part of the papal domain . A long struggle , however , arose for the possessions of the Greeks . The Lombard kings , always hostile to the Popes , sought to appropriate the Exarchate , and the acute Popes appealed for aid to the rising power of France . But it was not to the feeble Merovingian kings that they addressed themselves , but to Charles Martel and his ambitious descendants . To gratify their own craving for temporal power the Popes founded the new dynasty of the Carlovingians . By the sanction and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantom kings ceased to reign in France , and Pepin , the founder of the Carlovingians , ascended the throne of Clovis . The powerful Franks now became the protectors of the papacy ; Pepin , liberal to his spiritual benefactor , gave to the Popes the Exarchate and protected them from the Lombards ; and thus France , always catholic and always // orthodox , founded the temporal power of Rome . The Lombards , however , did not yield without a struggle . On one occasion they threatened Rome itself with destruction , and the Pope , Stephen ILL. , in an agony of terror , wrote two letters to Pepin claiming his protection . When the Frank neglected his appeals the Pope ventured upon the most remarkable and the most snccessful of all the pious frauds . Pepin received a third letter , addressed to him by the Apostle Peter himself , in his own handwriting . St. Peter and the Holy Virgin , in this curious epistle , adjure the Frankish king to save their beloved city from the impious Lombards , and Paradise and perpetual victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obeyed the divine summons , entered Italy as the champion of St. Peter , and in 755 bestowed upon the bishops of Rome the authority and the dominions of a temporal prince . The gift was afterward enlarged and confirmed by Charlemagne . This eminent man , who ruled over France , Germany , Italy , and a part of Spain , altogether destroyed the Lombard kingdom , and placed Leo III . securely on the papal throne . In return the grateful Pope crowned the half-barbarous Karl , Augustus and Emperor of the West . It was on Christmas of the last year of the eighth century . Charles and his magnificent court were assembled at the celebration of the Nativity at Rome ; the Roman nobles and clergy looked on in a splendid throng ; the Pope himself chanted mass ; at its close he advanced to Charles , placed a splendid crown upon his head , and saluted him as Cusar Augustus . The assembly broke into loud acelamations , and Charles , with feigned or real reluctance , consented to be anointed by the hands of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take part in the politics of Europe . They made war or peace , formed leagues and unholy alliances , intrigued , plotted , plundered their neighbors , oppressed their subjects , and filled Italy and Europe with bloodshed and crime . The possession of temporal power , that " fatal gift , ' denounced by Dante and Milton , his translator , corrupted the sources of Western Christianity until it became the chief aim of the later Popes to enlarge their possessions by force or fraud , and add to those rich territories which they had won from the superstition of Pepin and the policy of Charlemagne . The great Emperor died , Europe fell into the anarchy of Feudalism , and the bishops of Rome rose into new grandeur and importance . As the successors of St. Peter they asserted their supremacy over kings and emperors , and claimed the right of disposing of crowns and kingdoms at will . St. Peter no longer wrote humble letters asking aid from the barbarous Frank ; he thundered from d4smantled Rome in the menacing tone of command . The representative Pope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hildebrand , the Cusar of the papacy . Hildebrand was the son of a carpenter , but he was destined to rule over kings and nobles . His youth was marked by intense austerity , and he was a monk from his boyhood . He early entered upon the monastic life , but his leisure hours were passed in t*cquiring knowledge , and his bold and vigorous intellect was soon filled with schemes for advancing the power and grandeur of the Church . Small , delicate , and unimposing in appearance , his wonderful eyes often terrified the beholder . He came up to Rome , became the real master of the Church , and was long content to rule in a subordinate position . Pope after Pope died , but Hildebrand still remained immovable , the guide and oracle of Rome . He revolved in secret his favorite principles , the celibacy of the clergy , the supremacy of the Popes , the purification of the Church . At lengths in 1073 , on the death of Alexander II. , the clergy with one voice named Hildebrand the successor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarlet robe , the tiara placed upon his head , and Gregory VII . was enthroned , weeping and reluctant , in the papal chair . His elevation was the signal for the most wonderful change in the character and purposes of the Church . The Pope aspired to rule mankind . He claimed an absolute power over the conduct of kings , priests , and nations , and he enforced his decrees by the terrible weapons of anathema and excommunication . He denounced the marriages of the clergy as impious , and at once there arose all over Europe a fearful struggle between the ties of natural affection and the iron will of Gregory . Heretofore the secular priests and bishops had married , raised families , and lived blamelessly as husbands or fathers , in the enjoyment of marital and filial love . But suddenly all this was changed . The married priests were declared polluted end degraded , and were branded with ignominy and shame . Wives were torn from their devoted husbands , children were declared bastards , and the ruthless monk , in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church . The most painful consequences followed . The wretched women , thus degraded and accursed , were often driven to suicide in their despair . Some threw themselves into the flames ; others were found dead in their beds , the victims of grief or of their own resolution not to survive their shame , while the monkish chroniclers exult over their misfortunes , and triumphantly consign them to eternal woe . Thus the clergy under Gregory 's guidance became a monastic order , wholly separated from all temporal interests , and bound in a perfect obedience to the Church . He next forbade all lay investitures or appointments to bishoprics or other clerical offices , and declared himself the supreme ruler of the ecclesiastical affairs of nations . No temporal sovereign could fill the great European sees , or claim any dominion over the extensive territories held by eminent churchmen in right of their spiritual power . It was against this claim that the Emperor of Germany , Henry // IV. , rebelled . The great bishoprics of his empire , Cologne , Bremen , Treves , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he suffer the imperious Pope to govern them at will his own dominion would be reduced to a shadow . And now began the famous contest between Hildebrand and Henry , between the carpenter 's son and the successor of Charlemagne , between the Emperor of Germany and the Head of the Church . It opened with an adventure that marks well the wild and lawless nature of the time . On Christmas-eve , 1075 , the rain poured down in torrents at Rome , confining the people to their houses , while the Pope with a few ecelesiastics was keeping a holy vigil in the distant church of Santa Maria Maggiore . The wild night and the favorable opportunity were seized upon by Cencius , a Roman baron , to wreak his vengeance upon Gregory for some former offense . His soldiers broke into the church while the Pope was celebrating mass , rushed to the altar , and seized the sacred person of the pontiff . He was even wounded in the forehead , and being stripped of his holy vestments , was dragged away bleeding and faint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong tower . Two of the worshipers , a noble matron and a faithful friend , followed him to his prison . The man covered him with furs , and warmed his chilled feet in his own bosom ; the woman stanched the blood , bound up the wound , and sat weeping at his side . But the city was now aroused , the bells tolled , the trumpets pealed , and the clergy who were officiating in the different churches broke off from their services , and summoned the people to the rescue of the Pope . As the morning dawned a great throng ef his deliverers assembled around the place of Gregory 's imprisonment , uncertain whether he were alive or dead . Engines were brought and planted against the tower , its walls began to tremble , and the fierce Cencius , now terrified and despairing , threw himself at the Pope 's feet , begging his forgiveness . The patient Pope consented , and only imposed upon Cencius the penance of a pilgrimage to Jerusalem . In the mean time the people broke into the tower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whence he had been taken , where he finished the sacred rites which had been so rudely interrupted . The assassin Cencius and his kindred were driven from the city , and their houses and strong towers were razed to the ground . It was plain to all that no physical danger could shake the iron resolution of Gregory : he next determined to humble the self-willed Emperor . Henry , flushed with victory , surrounded by faithful bishops and nobles , attended by mighty armies , had refused with petulant contempt to obey the decrees of Rome . Hildebrand summoned him to appear before his tribunal , and if he should refuse to come , appointed the day on which sentence of excommunication should be pronounced against him . The Emperor replied by assembling a council of his German nobles and priests , who proclaimed the deposition of the Pope . All Christendom seemed united to crush the Bishop of Rome ; the married clergy , the Simonists , and all who had received their investiture from temporal sovereigns joined in a fierce denunciation of his usurpation . But Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle or an omen inspired the superstitious assembly . An egg was produced with much awe and solemnity , on which a serpent was traced in bold relief recoiling in mortal agony from a shield against which it had vainly struck its fangs . The bishops gazed upon the prodigy with consternation , but Gregory interpreted it with the skill of a Roman augur . The serpent was the dragon of the Apocalypse , its mortal agony foretold the triumph of the Church . A wild enthusiasm filled the assembly , the anathema of Rome was hurled against Henry , his subjects were absolved from their allegiance , and the king was declared excommunicated . The effect of this spiritual weapon was wonderful : the power of the great Emperor melted away like mist before the wind . His priests shrank from him as a lost soul , his nobles abandoned him , his people looked upon him with abhorrence , and Henry was left with a fe*v armed followers and a few faithful bishops in a lonely castle oii the Rhine . Henry , with abject submission , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In mid-winter , accompanied by his wife , his infant son , and one faithful attendant , having scarcely sufficient money to pay the expenses of his travel , he set out to cross the Alps and throw himself at Gregory 's feet . Never was there a more miserable journey . The winter was unusually severe , and great quantities of snow filled up the Alpine passes . The slippery surface was not hard enough to bear the weight of the travelers , and even the most experienced mountaineers trembled at the dangers of the passage . Yet the imperial party pressed on ; the king must reach Italy or his crown was lost forever . When , after much toil and suffering , they reached the summit of the pass the danger was increased . A vast precipice of ice spread before them so slippery and smooth that he who entered upon it could scarcely avoid being huried into the depths below . Yet there was no leisure for hesitation . The queen and her infant son were wrapped in the skins of oxen and drawn down as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and knees , clung to the shoulders of the guides , and thus , half-sliding , and sometimes rolling down the steeper declivities , they reached the plain unharmed . Gregory , meanwhile , doubtful at first of Henry 's real design , had taken refuge in the castle of Canosa , the mountain strong-hold of his unchanging friend and ally , the great Countess Matilda . The praises of this eminent woman have been sung by poets and repeated by historians , but the crowning trait of her singular life was her untiring devotion to Gregory . For // him she labored and lived ; on him her treasures were lavished ; her mountain castles were his refuge in moments of danger ; her armies fought in his defense ; she was never satisfied unless the Pope was at her side ; and she made a will by which at her death all her rich possessions should revert to Gregory and the Church . Matilda was the daughter of Boniface , Margrave of Tuscany , and his only heir . A celibate although wedded , she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had parted forever from her unwelcome husband on her wedding-day . Hildebrand alone , the low-born and unattractive monk , had won the affections of the high-bred and selfwilled woman ; they were inseparable companions in adversity or success , and the Pope owed his life , his safety , and his most import . ant achievements to a member of that sex which he had so bitterly persecuted and contemned . To Canosa came Henry , the fallen Emperor , seeking permission to cast himself at his enemy 's feet . On a bitter winter morning , when the ground was covered deep with snow , he approached the castle gate and was admitted within the first of the three walls that sheltered Gregory and Matilda . Clothed in a thin white linen dress , the garb of a penitent , his feet bare , his head uncovered , the king awaited all day , in the outer court , the opening of the gate which should admit him to the presence of Gregory . But the relentless Pope left him to shiver in the cold . A second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle gate , and hungry , chilled , disheartened , besought admission , but in vain . The spectators who witnessed his humiliation were touched with compassion , and every heart but that of Gregory softened toward the penitent king . At length Henry was admitted to the presence of the compassionate Matilda , fell on his knees before her , and besought her merciful interference . Gregory yielded to her prayers , and the Pope and his rightful lord , whom he had subjugated , met at a remarkable interview . Tall , majestic in figure , his feet bare and still clad in a penitential garb , the haughty henry bowed in terror and contrition before the small and feeble grayhaired old man who had made kings the servants of the Church . Henry subscribed to every condition the Pope imposed ; obedience to ecclesiastical law , perfect submission to the Pope , even the abandonment of his kingdom should such be Gregory 's will . On these terms he was absolved , and with downcast eyes and broken spirit returned to meet the almost contemptuous glances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that moment was so bitterly hated by hosts of foes as the triumphant Gregory . Christendom , which had yielded to his severe reforms , abhorred the reformer ; Italy shrank from his monastic rigor ; even Rome was unquiet , and Hildebrand 's only friends were his faithful Countess and the Norman conquerors of Naples . No sooner had Henry left Canosa than he seemed suddenly to recover from that strange moral and mental prostration into which his adversary 's spiritual arts had thrown him . He was once more a king . He inveighed in bitter terms against the harshness and pride of Gregory ; his Lombard chiefs gathered around him and stimulated him to vengeance , while Matilda hurried the Pope back again , fearful for his life , to the impregnable walls of Canosa . But the dangerous condition of his German dominions for a while delayed his plans of vengeance . The German and Saxon princes and bishops who had abandoned him in his moment of humniliation , now fearful of his power , met in a solemn diet at Forcheim , deposed Henry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil war , nourished by the arts of Gregory , desolated all Germany ; the Pope once more excommunicated Henry , and declared his rival king , and he even ventured to prophesy that , unless Henry made his submission by the 29th of June , the festival of St. Peter and St. I*aul , he would either be deposed or dead . The fierce priest , assuming to speak by inspiration , was willing to be judged by the failure or the success of his vaticination . But the result was far different from his hopes . Henry met his adversary , Rudolph , on the field of Elster ; the Saxons conquered , but Rudolph was slain . His death allowed Henry to turn his arms against his spiritual foe at Rome . He crossed the Alps into Italy , but not us he had crossed them four years before , a heart-broken and trembling suppliant weighed down by superstitious dread . Excommunication had lost its terrors ; Gregory had been proved a false prophet and a deceiver , and Matilda 's forces , defeated and disheartened , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchecked to the walls of Rome and laid siege to the holy city . Gregory , whom no dangers could move , firm in his spiritual superiority , made a bold defense ; his people were united in his cause , the Countess supplied him with considerable sums of money , and for three years the massive walls repelled the invader , and the Italians saw with natural exultation the host of abhorred Germans and Lombards decimated by malarias , disease , and perpetual fevers . At length , however , the city fell , Gregory retreated into the castle of St. Angelo  --  a temporary refuge from the vengeance be had invoked  --  and Henry caused a rival Pope , under the name of Clement III. , to be consecrated in St. Peter 's , and received from his hands the imperial crown . Gregory 's end seemed now drawing near . Famine and the sword must soon drive him from his retreat , and he well knew that he would receive short shrift from his enraged German lord . But at this moment news came that Robert Guiscard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Southern Italy to his rescue . Henry retreated , and the Norman soon became master of Rome . Gregory was released , and respectfully conducted to the // Lateran Palace ; but a fatal event made his return to power the source of incalculable woes to his faithful people . The army that had conquered Rome was composed of half-savage Normans and infidel Saracens  --  the peculiar objects of hatred to the Roman populace  --  and they had marked their entry into the city by a general pillage and license . The Romans resolved upon revenge . While the Normans were feasting in riotous security they rose in revolt , and began a terrible carnage of their conquerors . The Normans , surprised , but well-disciplined , soon swept the streets with their cavalry , while the citizens fought boldly from their houses , and seemed for a moment to gain the superiority . Guiscard then gave orders to set fire to the honses . The city was soon in flames ; convents , churches , palaces , and private dwellings fed the conflagration ; the people rushed wildly through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the safety of their wives and children ; while the fierce Normans and Saracens , maddened by their treachery , perpetrated all those horrible deeds that mark the sack of cities . Rome suffered more in this terrible moment than in all the invasions of the Goths and Vandals . Thousands ' of its citizens were sold into slavery or carried prisoners to Calabria , and its miserable ruin was only repaired when a new city was gradually buiJt in a different site on the ancient Campus Martius . Gregory , it is said , looked calmly on the sack of his faithful city . For its destroyers he had no word of reproof . The ferocious Guiscard was still his ally and his protector . He retired , however , to Salerno , being afraid to trust himself in Rome , and from thence issued anew an excommunication against Henry and the usurping pontiff , Clement III . As death approached no consciousness of the great woes he had occasioned , of the fierce wars he had stirred up , of the ruin he had brought upon Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miserable fate of Rome , seems to have disturbed his sublime serenity . At one moment he had believed himself a prophet , at another an infallible guide ; he was always the vicegerent of Heaven ; and just before his death he gave a general absolution to the human race , excepting only Henry and his rival Pope . lie died May 25 , 1085 , having bequeathed to his successors the principle that the Bishop of Rome was the supreme power of the earth . This was the conception which Gregory plainly represents . The idea was never lost to his successors . It animated the Popes of the eleventh century in their long struggle against the Emperors of Germany ; it stimulated the ardor of the Guelphic faction , whose vigor gave liberty to Italy ; but its full development is chiefly to be traced in the character of Innocent III . Of all the Bishops of Rome Innocent approached nearest to the completion of Gregory 's grand idea . He was the true Universal Bishop , deposing kings , trampling upon nations , crushing out heresy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrible to his friends  --  the incarnation of spiritual despotism and pride . In the year 1198 , at the age of thirty-seven , in the full strength of manhood , Innocent ascended the papal throne . His learning was profound , his morals pure ; he was descended from a noble Italian family ; he had already written a work on " Contempt of the World , and the Misery of Human Life , " and his haughty and self-reliant intellect was well fitted to subdue that miserable world which he so pitied and contemned . Yet his ruthless policy filled Europe with bloodshed and woe . He interfered in the affairs of Germany , and for ten years , with but short intervals of truce , that unhappy land was rent with civil discord . He deposed his enemy , the Emperor OthQ , and placed Frederick II. , half infidel , half Saracen , the last of the Hohenstaufens , on the German throne . He ruled over Rome and Italy with an iron hand . But it was in France and England that the despotic power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and both those mighty kingdoms were reduced to abject submission to the will of the astute Italian . France , in the year 1200 , was ruled by the firm hand of the licentious , self-willed , but vigorous *hilip Augustus . Philip , after the death of his first wife , Isabella of Hainault , had resolved upon a second marriage . He bad heard of the rare beauty , the long bright hair , the gentle manners of Ingeburga , sister to the King of Denmark , and he sent to demand her hand . The Dane consented , and the fair princess set sail for France , unconscious of the long succession of sorrows that awaited her in that southern land . The nuptials were celebrated , the queen was crowned , but from that moment Philip shrank from his bride with shuddering horror . No one could tell the cause , nor did the king ever reveal it . Some said that he was under the influence of a demon , some that he was bewitched . Yet certain it is that he turned pale and shuddered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he hated her with intense vigor , and that he sacrificed the peace of his kingdom , the welfare of his people , and very nearly his crown itself , rather than acknowledge as his wife one who was to him all gentleness and love . At all hazards lie resolved to obtain a divorce , and the obsequious clergy of France soon gratified his wishes in this respect , upon the pretense that the ill-assorted pair were within the degree of consanguinity limited by the Church . The marriage was declared dissolved . When the news of her humiliation was brought to the unhappy stranger-queen , she cried out , in her broken language , " Wicked , wicked France ! Rome , Rome ! " She refused to return to Denmark to betray her disgrace to her countrymen , but shut herself up in a convent , where her gentleness and her piety won the sympathy of the nation . Philip , having thus relieved himself forever , as ho no doubt supposed , of his Danish wife , // began to look round for her successor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his offers , distrustful of his fickle affections ; a fourth , Agnes , daughter of the Duke of Meran , was more courageous , and was rewarded by a most unusual constancy . To the fair Agnes Philip gave his heart , his hand , his kingdom . His love for her rose almost to madness . For her he bore the anathemas of the Church , the hatred of his people , the murmurs of his nobles , the triumph of his foes . Beautiful , young , intelligent , graceful , Agnes seems to have well deserved the devotion of the king . Her gentle manners and various accomplishments won the hearts of the gallant chivalry of France , and even touched and softened her enemies-the austere clergy . She bore the king three children , and his affection for her never ceased but with her death . Miserable , however , was the fate of the rival queen . Ingeburga , in her distress , had appealed to Rome ; her brother , the King of Denmark , pressed her claims upon the Pope ; while Philip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruelty . She was dragged from convent to convent , from castle to castle , to induce her to abandon her appeal ; her prayers and her entreaties were received with cold neglect , and she who was entitled to be Queen of France was the most ill-used woman in the land . She was now at last to find a champion and a protector . Innocent , soon after his accession , resolved to interfere in the affair , and to build up the grandeur of his see upon the misfortunes of two unhappy wives and the violent king . Ingeburga , however gentle and resigned , had never ceased to assert openly her marital claims ; she pursued her recreant husband with a persistency only equaled by his own obstinate aversion to her person , and she now joined with Innocent in a last effort to reclaim him . The Pope sent a legate into France with a command to Philip to put away the beautiful Agnes , and receive back the hated Dane . If he did not comply with the orders of his spiritual father within thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and the sin of the sovereign was to be visited upon his unoffending people . Philip , enraged rather than intimidated , treated Innocent 's message with contempt ; the thirty days expired , and the fatal sentence was pronounced . For the first time in the annals of Home it ventured to inflict a spiritual censure upon a whole nation ; for the effect of an interdict was to close the gates of heaven to mankind . All over gay and prosperous France rested a sudden gloom . The churches were closed , and the worshipers driven from their doors ; the rites of religion ceased ; marriages were celebratedin the church-yards ; the bodies of the dead were refused burial in consecrated ground , and flung out to perish in the corrupted air ; baptism and the last unctjon were the only services allowed ; the voice of prayer and praise ceased throughout the land ; and the French with astonishment found themselves condemned to eternal woe for the sin of Philip and fair Agnes of Meran . The punishment seemed no doubt irrational and extravagant even to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no less effectual . Philip sought to prevent the enforcement of the interdict by punishing the clergy who obeyed it ; and he swore that he would lose half his kingdom rather than part with Agnes . But Innocent enforced the obedience of the priests , France grew mutinous under its spiritual sufferings , and the king was forced to submit . " I will turn Mohammedan , " he cried in his rage . " Happy Saladin , who has no Pope above him ! " Agnes , too , wrote a touching letter to the Pope , in which she said " she cared not for the crown ; it was on the husband that she had set her love . Part me not from him . " But Innocent never relented . Agnes was torn from her husband and her love , and was confined in a lonely castle in Normandy , where she was seen at times wandering upon the battlements with wild gestures and disheveled hair , her face wan and pale , her eyes streaming with tears , and then was seen no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , by a train of Italian priests to the arms of her loathing husband , and , whether witch or woman , Philip was forced to receive her publicly as his wife* France rejoiced , for the interdict was removed ; a clang of bells announced the return of spiritual peace ; the curtains were withdrawn from crucifixes and images ; the doors of churches flew open ; and a glad throng of worshipers poured into the holy buildings , from which for seven months they had been rigidly excluded . Yet the change brought little joy to the Queen of France . For the remainder of her life her husband treated her sometimes with harshness , always with neglect and contempt , and her plaintive appeals against his cruelty sometimes reached the ears of Innocent at Rome , who would then remonstrate with Philip upon his unworthy conduct toward the daughter , the sister , and the wife of a king . The Pope next turned his spiritual arms against England , and soon reduced that powerful and independent kingdom to the condition of a vassal of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of English kings , now sat on the throne . His life had been stained by almost every form of licentiousness and , crime ; he had murdered his nephew , Arthur , and nsurped his crown ; he had shrank from no enormity , and his subjects looked upon him with horror and disgust ; Philip had torn from him all his continental possessions ; and his cowardice had been as conspicuous as his vices . Yet John had ever remained the favorite son of the Church , and Innocent would still have continued his ally and his friend had not a sudden quarrel made them , for the moment , the bitterest of foes . It would be impossible for us to review the full particulars of this memorable affair . It is sufficient to say that Innocent claimed the right of controlling the election of // THE BISHOPS OF ROME . the Archbishop of Canterbury , and that John resisted his pretension . The Pope employed the instrument which had been so effective ngainst France : in 1208 England was laid under an interdict , and for four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into unconsecrated ground , and its whole religious life crushed beneath a fatal malediction . Yet John resisted the clerical assailant with more pertinacity than Philip , ani even endured the final penalty* of excommunication , and it was not until Innocent had bestowed England upon Philip , and that king had prepared a considerable army to invade his new dominions , that John 's courage sank . Full of hatred for the Pope and for religion , it is said that he had resolved to become a Mohammedan , and sent embassadors to the Caliph of Spain and Africa offering to embrace the faith of the Koran in return for material aid ; and it is further related that the cultivated Mohammedan rejected with contempt the advances of the Christian renegade . So low , indeed , was sunk the moral dignity of Christianity under the papal rule , so oppressive was that power , that of the three great potentates of Christendom at this period Frederick H. was suspected of preferring the Koran to the Bible , and both Philip Augustus and John are believed to have entertained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all three were no doubt objects of polished scorn to the cultivated Arabs of Bagdad and Cordova . John was soon reduced to submission , and his conduct was so base and dastardly as to awaken the scorn of his own subjects and of Europe . He gave up his independent kingdom to be held as a fief of the Roman see , took the oath of fealty to Innocent , and bound himself and his successors to become the vassals of an Italian lord . But his shame was probably lightened by a sense of the bitter disappointment which he was thus enabled to inflict upon his enemy , Philip Augustus . The Pope , with his usual indifference to the claims of honor and of faith , now prohibited the King of France from prosecuting his designs against England , and Philip , who at a great expense had assembled all the chivalry of his kingdom , was forced to obey . The barons of England soon after wrested from their dastard king the Magna Charta , and Innocent in vain endeavored to weaken the force of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and of America . But it is chiefly as the first of the great persecutors that Innocent III . has deserved the execration of posterity . He was the destroyer of the Albigenses and the troubadours , and the first buds and flowers of European literature were crushed by the ruthless hand of the impassive Bishop of Rome . Languedoc and Provence , the southern provinces of modern France , were at this period the most civilized and cultivated portions of Europe . Amidst their graceful scenery , their rich fields , and magnificent cities , the troubadours had first sung to the lute those plaintive love-songs , borrowed from the intellectual Arabs , which seemed to the rude but impassioned barons of the south almost inspired . The Gay Science found its fitting birth-place along the soft shores of the Mediterranean Sea , the Courts of Love were held oftenest at Montpellier , Toulouse , or Marseilles . The princes and nobles of that southern clime were allowed to be the models of their age in chivalry , good-breeding , and a taste for poetry and song ; and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rich , happy , and secure . Upon this Eden Innocent chanced to turn his eyes and discover that it was infested by a most fatal form of heresy . The troubadours-gay , witty , and indiscreethad long been accustomed to aim sharp satires at the vices or the superstitions of monks and bishiops ; the people had learned to look with pity and contempt upon the ignorance of their spiritual guides ; the authority of the Church was shaken , the priest was despised , and the Waldensian and Albigensian doctrines made rapid progress and found an almost universal acceptance in the sunny lands of the south of France . Raymond VI. , Count of Toulouse , now reigned with an easy sway over this delightful terrjtory . He was believed to be a heretic , yet he was evidently no Puritan . Gay , licentious , generous , affable , the Count had three wives living at the same time , and might well have merited , by his easy morals , the confidence of the Church of Rome . But , unhappily for Raymond , his humanity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Innocent was resolved to extirpate heresy by fire and sword , and Raymond was required to execute the papal commands upon his own people . He was to bring desolation to the fair fields of Languedoc , to banish or destroy the heretics , to lay waste his own happy dominions , depopulate his cities , cut off the wisest and best of his subjects , for the sake of a corrupt and cruel Church , which he must now more than ever have abhorred . Life meanwhile had flowed on for the happy people of Languedoc in mirth and perpetual joy . They sang , they danced ; the mistress was more honored than the saint , and churches and cathedrals were abandoned for the Courts of Love . In the fair city of Toulouse a perfect tolerance prevailed . The " good men " of Lyons , the Cathari or Puritans , made converts undisturbed , and even the despised and rejected Jews were received with signal favor by the goodhumored Proven*als . Nothing was hated but the bigotry and pride of priestcraft , and when Arnold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rome , came to preach against heresy and reclaim the erring to the orthodox faith , his most vigorous sermons were received with shouts of ridicule . " The more he preached , " says the Proven9al chronicler , " the more the people laughed and held him for a fool . " But a terrible doom was now impending over the merry land of song , for Innocent had resolved 9 2*5 // to call in the aid of the temporal power , and involve both Raymond and his subjects in a common ruin . A fatal event urged him to immediate action . The papal legate was assassinated as he was crossing the Rhone , and the Pope charged the crime upon Raymond , who , however , was wholly guiltless . The blood of the martyr called for instant vengeance , and Innocent summoned the king , the nobles , and the bishops of France to a crusade against the devoted land . " Up , most Christian king , " he wrote to Philip Augustus ; " up , and aid us in our work o ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general uprising of the chivalry and the bishops of the north of France , who , led by Simon de Montfort , hastened to the plunder of their brethren of the south . An immense army suddenly invaded Languedoc ; the war was carried on with a barbarity unfamiliar even to that cruel age , and the Albigenses and the troubadours were almost blotted from existence . No quarter was given , no mercy shown , and the battle-cry of the invading army was , " Slay all , God will know his own . " At the capture of Beziers it is estimated that fifty thousand persons perished in the massacre . Harmless men , wailing women , and even babes at the breast fell equally before the monkish rage of Innocent , and the beautiful city was left a smouldering ruin . At the fall of Minerve , a strong-hold in the Civennes , one hundred and forty women , rather than change their faith , leaped into a blazing pyre and were consumed . When Lavaur , a noted seat of heresy , was taken , a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children were cut to pieces , until there was nothing left to kill , except four hundred of the garrison , who were burned in a single pile , which , to the great joy of the victorious Catholics , made a wonderful blaze . After a long and brave resistance the Albigensian armies were destroyed , and the desolate land , once so beautiful , fell wholly into the power of the Catholics . The song of the troubadour was hushed forever , the gay people sank into melancholy under the monkish rule , their very language was proscribed , and a terrible inquisition was established to crush more perfectly the lingering seeds of heresy . Every priest and every lord was appointed an inquisitor , and whoever harbored a heretic was made a slave . Even the house in which a heretic was found was to be razed to the ground ; no layman was permitted to possess a Bible ; a reward of a mark was set for the head of a heretic ; and all caves and hiding-places where the Albigenses might take refuge were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two agents of rare vigor had suddenly appeared to aid Innocent in his conquest of mankind ; two men of singular moral and mental strength placed themselves at his command . St. Dominic and St. Francis of Assissi founded , under his supervision , the two great orders of mendicauf monks . Dominic was a Spaniard of high birth , fierce , dark , gloomy , unsparing , the author of the Inquisition . His history is lost in a cloud of miracles , in which it has been enveloped by his devout disciples ; he cast out Satan , who ran from him in the form of a great black cat with glittering eyes ; he raised the dead , healed the sick , and more than equaled the miracles of the Gospel . Yet the real achievements of Dominic are sufficiently wonderful . He founded the order of preaching friars , who , living upon alms and bound to a perfect self-denial , knew no master but Dominic and the Pope , and before he died he saw a countless host of his disciples spread over every part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heretics . He infused into the Roman Church that fierce thirst for blood which was exemplified in Philip II . and Alva ; he hovered around the armies that blasted and desolated Languedoc , and his miraculous eloquence was aimed with fatal effect against the polished free-thinkers of that unhappy land . His admirers unite in ascribing to him the founding of the Inquisition . " What glory , splendor , and dignity , " exclaims one of them , " belongs to the Order of Preachers , words can not express ! for the Holy Inquisition owes its origin to St. Dominic , and was propagated by his faithful followers . " St. Francis of Assissi , a gentler madman , was equally successful with Dominic in founding a new order of ascetics . Born of a wealthy parentage , Francis passed his youth in song and revel until a violent fever won him from the world . His mild and generous nature now turned to universal benevolence ; he threw aside his rich dress and joined a troop of beggars ; he clothed himself in rags and gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared was Poverty , and he would only live by mendicancy ; he resolved to abase himself below the meanest of his species , and he devoted himself to the care of lepers  --  the outcasts of mankind ; he tended them with affectionate assiduity , washed their feet , and sometimes healed them miraculously with a kiss . This strange and fervent piety , joined to his touching eloquence and poetic fancy , soon won for St. Francis a throng of followers , who imitated his humility and took the vow of perpetual poverty . He now resolved to convert the world ; but he must first gain the sanction of the Pope . Innocent III . was walking on the terrace of the splendid Lateran when a mendicant of mean appearance presented himself and proposed to convert mankind through poverty and humility . It was St. Francis . The Pope at first dismissed him with contempt ; but a vision warned him not to neglect the pious appeal . The Order of St. Francis was founded , and countless hosts soon took the vow of chastity , poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : they lived on alms ; if stricken on one cheek they offered the other ; if robbed of a part of their dress they gave the whole . Love was to be the binding element of the brotherhood , and the sweet effluence of universal chari // ty , the poetic dream of the gentle Francis , was to be spread over all mankind . How rapidly the Franciscans and Dominicans declined from the rigid purity of their founders need scarcely be told . In a few years their monasteries grew splendid , their possessions were vast , their vows of poverty and purity were neglected or forgotten , and the two orders , filled with emulation and spiritual pride , contended with each other for the control of Christendom . Innocent , meantime , died in 1216 , in the full strength of manhood , yet having accomplished every object for which his towering spirit had labored so unceasingly . He had crushed and mortified the pride of every European monarch , had exalted the Church upon the wreck of nations , had seemingly extirpated heresy , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Great , had seemed the symbol of Antichrist and the invention of Satanic pride . The next phase in which the Papacy exhibits itself is the natural result of the possession of absolute temporal and spiritital power ; the next representative Pope is a Borgia . In no other place than Rome could a Borgia have arisen ; in no other position than that of Pope could so frightful a monster have maintained his power . Alexander VI. , or Roderic Borgia , a Spaniard of noble family and nephew to Pope Calixtus HI. , was early brought to Rome by his uncle , and made a cardinal in spite of his vices and his love of ease . He became Pope in 1492 by the grossest simony . Alexander 's only object was the gratification of his own desires and the exaltation of his natural children . Of these , whom he called his nephews , . there were fiveone son being C*usar Borgia , and one daughter the infamous Lucrezia . Alexander is represented to have been a poisoner , a robber , a hypocrite , a treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surpassed their father . Ctusar Borgia , beautiful in person , and so strong that in a bull-fight he struck off the bead of the animal at a single blow  --  a majestic monster ruled by unbridled passions and stained with blood , now governed Rome and his father by the terror of his crimes . Every night , in the streets of the city , were found the corpses of persons whom he had murdered either for their money or for revenge , yet no one dared to name the assassin . Those whom he could not reach by violence he took off by poison . His first victim was his own elder brother , Francis , Duke of Gandia , whom Alexander loved most of all his children , and whose rapid rise in wealth and station excited the hatred of the fearful Cnsar . Francis had just been appointed Duke of Benevento , and before he set out for Naples there was a family party of the Borgias one evening at the papal palace , where no doubt a strange kind of mirth and hilarity prevailed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ctesar having meantime provided four assassins to waylay his victim that very night . The next morning the duke was missing ; several days passed but he did not return . It was believed that he was murdered ; and Alexander , full of grief , ordered the Tiber to be dragged for the body of his favorite child . An enemy , he thought , had made away with him . He little suspected who that enemy was . At length a Selavonian waterman came to the palace with a startling story . He said that on the night when the prince disappeared , while he was watching some timber on the river , he saw two men approach the bank and look cautiously around to see if they were observed . Seeing no one they made a signal to two others , one of whom was on horseback , and who carried a dead body swung carelessly across his horse . He advanced to the river , flung the corpse far into the . water , and then rode away . Upon being asked why he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common occurrence , and that he had seen more than a hundred bodies thrown into the Tiber in a similar manner . The search was now renewed , and the body of the ill-fated Francis was found pierced by nine mortal wounds . Alexander bnried his son with great pomp , and offered large rewards for the discovery of his murderers . At last the terrible secret was revealed to *him ; he hid himself in his palace , refused food , and abandoned himself to grief . Here he was visited by the mother of his children , who still lived at Rome . What passed at their interview was never known ; but all . inquiry into the murder ceased , and Alexander was soon again immersed in his pleasures and his ambitious designs . Ctusar Borgia now ruled unrestrained , and preyed upon the Romans like some fabulous monster of Greek mythology . He would suffer no rival to live , and he made no secret of his murderous designs . His brother- in - law was stabbed by his orders on the steps of the palace . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the latter preparing his food lest he might be carried off by poison , while the Pope set a guard around the house to protect his son-in-law from his son . Ctusar laughed at these precautions . " What can not be done in the noonday , " he said , " may be brought about in the evening . " He broke into the chamber of his brother-in-law , dro*'e out the wife and sister , and had him strangled by the common executioner . He stabbed his father 's favorite , Perotto , while he clung to his patron for protection , and the blood of the victim flowed over the face and robes of the Pope . Lucrezia ' Borgin rivaled , or surpasseq , the crimes of her brother ; while Alexander himself performed the holy rites of the Church with singular exactness , and in his leisure moments poisoned wealthy cardinals and seized upon their estates . He is said to have been singularly engaging in his manners , and most agreeable iu the society of those whom he had resolved to destroy . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grand entertainment , at which one or more wealthy cardinals were invited for the purpose // of being poisoned , and Caesar Borgia was to provide the means . He sent several flasks of poisoned wine to the table , with strict orders not to use them except by his directions . Alexander came early to the banquet , heated with exercise , and called for some refreshment ; the servants brought Thin the poisoned wine , supposing it to be of rare excellence ; he drank of it freely , and was soon in the pangs of death . His blackened body was buried with all the pomp of the Roman ritual . Scarcely is the story of the Borgias to be believed : such a father , such children , have never been known before or since . Yet the accurate historians of Italy , and the careful Ranke , unite in the general outline of their crimes . On no other throne save the temporal empire of Rome has sat such a criminal as Alexander ; in no other city but Rome could a C*esar Borgia have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever known . The Pope was the absolute master of the lives and fortunes of his subjects ; he was also the absolute master of their souls ; and the union of these two despotisms produced at Rome a form of human wickedness which romance has never imagined , and which history shudders to describe . We may pause at this era in our review of the representative bishops of Rome , since the Reformation was soon to throw a softening and refining light upon the progress of the papacy . There were to be no more Borgias , no second Innocent ; the fresh blasts from the north were to purify in some measure the malarious atmosphere of the Holy City . Yet I trust this brief series of pictures of the early bishops will not have been without interest to the candid reader , and that he will observe that it was only as the Roman Church abandoned the primeval laws of gentleness , humility , and humanity that it ceased to be the benefactor of the barbarous races it had subdued . As the splendid panorama passes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishing a sainted martyr in the Catacombs ; the modest Gregory , the first singing-master of Europe , soothing the savage world to obedience and order by the sweet influence of his holy songs ; the cunning Zacharias winning a temporal crown from the grateful Frank ; Hildebrand rising in haughty intellectual pre-eminence above kings and princes ; Innocent III . trampling upon the rights of nations , and lifting over Europe his persecuting arm red with the guiltless blood of the troubadours and the Albigenses ; or a Borgia , the incarnation of sin-we sh*tll have little difficulty in discovering why it is that the bishops of Rome have faded into a magnificent pageant before the rise of a purer knowledge , and why it is that the Pope of to-day , surrounded by the most splendid of earthly rituals , and pronouncing from the Vatican the anathemas of the Middle Ages , is heard with mingled pity and derision by the vigorous intellect of the nations over which his predecessors once held an undisputed sway .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
