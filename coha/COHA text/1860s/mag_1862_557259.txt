That no fitter man than Dr. Sprague could have beell selected for its performance , will be scarcely less than unanimously conceded . The volume whose title is given above is the seventh in his series . Of the previous six , two each have been devoted to Presbyterian aIld Congregational subjects , and one each to Baptist and Episcopalian . Still other volumes , as we learn from the publishers , are in process of preparation . The other works in our list are a few of the biographical and historical productions in which the Methodist press has been so prolific of late years , and the materials for which exist so bountifully in the experience of the living or the recently departed . Every denomination , as represented by its ministers , has its peculiar features of interest , not only to its own members , but to the community at large . The distinguishing characteristics of the Methodist pulpit are found in the adventurous incidents of ministerial labor , the rude but effective eloquence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zeal amid the severe toils and trials of the pioneer period , and the fact that their intellectual life , imperfect at first and heterogeneous , yet vigorous and promising , was genuinely American in its character . Education in this country , so far as the product of the schools is concerned , has been for a great part of our history European rather than American . But there is a certain mental culture in a new nation , and especially in a republic , which goes on almost independently of schools and books , and which has a certain indigenous character . It results in a quickness of apprehension , strong practical judgment , ingenuity of adaptation to circumstances , and a thorough acquaintance with human nature . Not unfrequently this culture gives a more efficient power to the subject of it , than a scholarly training could have given him ; for our systems of school discipline , admirable and advantageous as they are to all who rightly use them , nevertheless impose artificial trammels on very many , and render them unpractical and incapable of popular influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our public men , some of our most trustworthy statesmen among them , and a great majority of our successful business men , are of the class whose education has been acquired outside of the seminary and college . Many of them , it is true , have become genuine students , and have not only diligently consulted many books , but have themselves made books of permanent value . But they have become vigorous thinkers rather by the friction and discipline of active life , than by any systematic preparation for that life . The early Methodist preacher was to a large extent the offspring of this popular culture . Coming from the masses of the people , and all the while that his intellectual character was in the process of formation working among the people , he grew up thoroughly fitted to their needs , and in time became an adept in his efforts to shape their convictions and character . Of this we shall have more to say hereafter . The beginning of the Methodist movement in America was in 1766 . It occurred almost simultaneously in Maryland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had emigrated from Ireland with several others , among them some who had previously belonged to the Methodist connection in their own // country . Embury himself had been a local preacher . The immigrants seem to have lost their interest in religion ; but after a time , under the urgency of a pious woman , Embury was induced to open his house for public worship , conducting the services himself . At the first meeting six were present . They organized a class , and their numbers gradually increased till the place was too strait for them . They hired a larger room , from which they were soon obliged to remove and build a chapel . The enterprise in Maryland had a not dissimilar commencement . Robert Strowbridge was also an Irish immigrant , and a Methodist local preacher . He began to hold meetings in his own house in Frederic County . Success attended his labors , and a society of twelve or fifteen persons was formed . Soon the log meeting-house , as it was called , was erected , and was for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of new fields creating a demand for more laborers , missionaries were sent from England , and some thousands were gathered into societies . It must be borne in mind that these societies were not churches , nor were the preachers clergymen . Both in Great Britain and in America , there was no intention for a long time of organizing a new church , but simply a striving after a higher spiritual life in those already established . Wesley and most of his preachers belonged to the Church of England . At the close of the Revolution the Church of England , of course , ceased to exist in this country , and no ecclesiastical body was yet provided to take its place . The Methodist societies were without any organization , except in subordination to a defunct church . They had no ordained ministers , and were deprived of the ordinances of Christianity . These embarrassments were removed by the adoption , in 1784 , of a plan prepared by John Wesley , organizing the Methodist Episcopal Church under the superintendence of Dr. Thomas Coke and Francis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been principally Englishmen ; but afterward the number of native preachers rapidly increased . As we have intimated , the hardships , personal sacrifices , and perilous adventures of the pioneer preachers are among the // most striking features in the description of this ministry . These were not confined to the early history of the Church nor of the nation ; for frontier life is always much the same , and as yet in this country it has never ceased . The line of civilization is still moving on into the wilderness , and the Methodist itinerant is ever in the remotest settlements , and with the van of the advancing army . Francis Asbury , the " Pioneer Bishop , " came to this country in 1771 , when about twenty-six years of age . He had commenced preaching in England when but a boy , and when the call came for laborers in the New World he freely offered himself for the self-sacrificing work . When the Revolution began , his British coadjutors fled to England , but he determined to remain , though obliged to desist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he found himself invested with the office of chief pastor , or bishop , of twenty thousand souls . The dignity was not such as he must have associated with the episcopal title in his early years . No one addresses him as , My Lord ; lie is not waited upon by crowds of dependents ; but he himself becomes the servant of all , surrendering even the conveniences of life for the perilous toil of seeking through rough wildernesses after lost sheep . He will have no splendid palace , no magnificent cathedral , no snug diocese , no princely income ; but , instead , he will preach in school-houses , in barns , on the stumps of trees ; his lodgings will be in log huts or in the houseless forest ; his diocese a whole continent , to visit which he must find his way , without roads , through almost illimitable woods , by blazed trees , over nearly inaccessible mountains , floundering through swamps , wading or swimming vast rivers , scorched by hot suns , bitten by winter frosts , drenched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often in divers dangers of death . His salary , - that must b* left to Providence . It is sometimes a little , sometimes less , and never worth mentioning . The limit is sixty-four dollars , this not always forthcoming , and even when received frequently shared with less fortunate brethren . His sacerdotal robes are of the frontier style , and after a six months ' jaunt in the wilderness are often found to be of variegated pattern , open-work , not embroidercd . His // travelling equipage is not a chariot and four , but saddlebags and one . For the first five years after his induction into the episcopal office his travels were confined to the east of the Alleghanies ; but they extended from New York on the north to Georgia on the south , and lie visited all the intermediate States as often as once a year , and many of them oftener . He rode on horseback from thirty to fifty miles daily , for the most part through dismal swamps , across bridgeless rivers , and , in pathless forests . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of floating ice , and then to travel twenty miles with his clothes wet to his breast . If his horse sometimes failed him through lameness or weariness , the man had no time to be weary , and pushed on alone ; for he had appointments in advance all along his route . He preached somewhere nearly every day . His sources of daily subsistence were uncertain . Cold , weary , wet , and hungry , he would call at the cabin of some settler in the wilderness , but not always to find a hospitable welcome . The family might have little for themselves , still less for a stranger . Sometimes he was refused outright , and sent miles away to some less churlish neighbor . Even then his entertainment was likely to be none of the best . His lodging in the log-loft might be all open to wind and storm . Naturally enough he was often sick . Violent headaches , sorethroat , and other diseases , were often the results of his exposure . Disturbances in his meetings were frequent . Men would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence to the preacher . The moral condition of the countries through which he travelled was exceedingly bad . Intemperance , profanity , and other social vices prevailed alarmingly . As early as 1786 he had crossed the Alleghanies , and , by a fearfully rugged and uncomfortable route , made his way as far as the banks of the Ohio . During his journey , whenever he fell in with any number of people , no matter how few , he proclaimed to them the word of life . Two years later he made his first visit to Tennessee . Going from North Carolina , he had to cross three ranges of mountains , without roads , without a guide , and with inhabitants only at appalling intervals . // It was perhaps a more toilsome and perilous journey than any previous one ; but a year or two before he had sent two or three preachers to that wild and distant region , and he felt bound to go wherever his preachers and their people were . How scantily this ecclesiastical chieftain was supplied with the necessaries of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by letters to his parents , residing in England . To the latter at one time he says : " My salary is sixty-four dollars a year . I have sold my watch and library , and would sell my shirts before you should want . I have made a reserve for you . I spend very little on my own account . My friends find me some clothing . The contents of a small saddlebags will do for me and one coat a year . " Writing at a later date , he says : " I study daily what I can do without . One horse , and that sometimes borrowed , one coat , one waistcoat ,  --  the last coat and waistcoat I used about fourteen months , - four or five shirts , and four or five books . " In 1806 , while attending the Western Conference , he writes : " The brethren were in want , and could not suit themselves , so I parted with my watch , my cloak , and my shirt . " He was at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preachers and more than one hundred and thirty thousand members ; himself almost without money , selling his watch and a part of his scanty wardrobe to supply the wants of those still poorer than himself . For forty-five years he was the recognized head of the denomination in this country . He annually made the tour of the States , travelling never less than five thousand , and often more than six thousand miles a year . He usually preached once every day and three times on Sunday , making more than twenty thousand discourses in all . When he died , the societies which , on his arrival in America , he had found consisting of six or seven hundred members , with six or seven preachers , numbered two hundred thousand members , with nearly seven hundred preachers . We have dwelt upon this one personage , perhaps at disproportionate length ; but lie was in many respects a representative man . The severe experiences which we jhave described were his only in common with scores and // hundreds of his fellow-laborers ; nor were they confined to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they continue to be the lot of pioneer preachers until this very day . Any person who will spend a few hours in some Western Conference will hear the story of like privation , toil , and suffering . We give an incident which occurred at one of these conferences scarcely more than a year ago . It is customary sometimes for the societies comprising a circuit to notify the conference , indicating what kind of a preacher they desire , usually specifying the intellectual , spiritual , or administrative qualities deemed requisite . One circuit sent in a petition for a minister , but said nothing about any characteristics as a preacher or a disciplinarian . One quality , however , he must have . " Be sure to send us a good swimmer , " said the petitioners . Of course , every one was puzzled , and none more so than the Bishop . On inquiry , it turned out that the circuit was situated in a region of wide and bridgeless streams , where the itinerant in keeping his appointments would have to rely on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister had been drowned on that circuit , because of his deficiency in this respect . Of the presence of these itinerant preachers in the backwoods settlements we have already spoken . Wherever the rifle and the axe of the hardy pioneer were seen , there were also sure to appear not long afterward the saddlebags of the Methodist minister . An anecdote which we find in the sketch of Richmond Nolley well illustrates this . Mr. Nolley was one of a small band of missionaries sent out from the South Carolina Conference , about 1812 , to labor in the wilds of Mississippi and Louisiana , which were then very sparsely settled , and occupied to some extent by tribes of not always friendly Indians . Mr. Nolley was a man of great energy , zeal , and courage . He was exposed to many dangers in the prosecution of his work , both from the hostile savages and the opposition of white men . But he was rigidly faithful , and omitted no opportunity of doing good to persons of any color or condition , in whatever obscure corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelling , he came upon a fresh wagontrack , and , following it , he discovered an emigrant family , who // had just reached the spot where they intended to make their home . The man , who was putting out his team , saw at once , by the costume and bearing of the stranger , what his calling was , and exclaimed , " What ! another Methodist preacher ! I quit Virginia to get out of the way of them , and went into a new settlement in Georgia , where I thought I should be quite beyond their reach ; but they got my wife and daughter into the church . Then , in this late purchase , Choctaw Corner , I found a piece of good land , and was sure I should have some peace of the preachers ; but here is one , before my wagon is unloaded . " " My friend , " said Nolley , " if you go to heaven , you 11 find Methodist preachers there ; and if to hell , I m afraid you 11 find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this world . So you had better make terms with us , and be at peace. ** The " hair-breadth scapes " which some of these men experienced are illustrated in the biography of Barnabas Mdllenry , who travelled in Tennessee and Kentucky when those States were a very wild territory . It is related that , as he was passing the night at the cabin of a friend , after the family had retired , he spent two or three hours reading at a table , by candle-light , with the door of the cabin partly open . The next night the Indians murdered the whole family , and stated that they had gone for that purpose the night before , but , finding the door open , and a light within , they supposed the inmates were prepared for an attack , and therefore postponed the execution of their plan . On another occasion , having stopped for the night at the house of his future father-in-law , Colonel ilardin , the Indians presented themselves in force , and carried off every horse on the plantation except his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was no unusual thing for him , in common with his co-laborers , to camp out at night in the solitude of the forests , with hostile Indians in near proximity , and the next day to preach , twenty miles farther on , to the frontier settlers , in cabins , forts , or block-houses , as the case might be . " The track , the trail , the yell of the Indian , his camp-fire and the crack of his rifle , watching by day , and sleeping under guard at night , were with these men almost ordinary occurrences. ** // But there were not only hardships and perils to be encountered ; violent persecutions frequently occurred . In many sections of the country the people were not only destitute of religions privileges , but vice and wickedness prevailed to an alarming extent . With all public and private immoralities the resolute itinerants were apt to come in contact , and they were not likely to compromise with sin of any sort . Naturally enough , they experienced some fierce opposition . Freeborn Garrettson , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Methodist preachers , was subject to a great deal of this severe treatment . He was often assaulted , and several times brought before magistrates on some pretended charge of disloyalty . On one of these occasions he was beaten with a large stick over the head and shoulders , and nearly killed . But he soon began to recover , and before he could walk an officer was called , who , instead of ordering the arrest of his adversary , began to make out a mittimus to send Mr. Garrettson to jail . But his reproof of the officer for his wickedness was so powerful , that the latter dropped his pen and promised not to molest him further . The same evening , sitting in a chair , he preached to a congregation gathered at a dwelling-house in the neighborhood , from the words , " In the world ye shall have tribulation ; but be of good courage , I have overcome the world . " At another time when he was preaching , a mob had gathered in the vicinity , and sent one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take him . But the heart of the poor spy was touched , and he returned at the close of the service to tell his associates that Mr. Garrettson had preached the truth , and that , if they ventured to lay a hand upon him , he would put the law in force against them . At one time he was seized while preaching by about twenty persons , one of whom presented a pistol at his breast . He was hurried away to prison , " where he had a dirty floor for his bed , his saddlebags for a pillow , while a cold east-wind blew directly upon him . " His friends were aroused in his behalf , and by the influence of Mr. Asbury with the Governor of Maryland he was at length set at liberty . Many such incidents occurred in his career , and he was by no means a solitary example . // The early preachers in the slaveholding regions , accustomed as they were to apply the Christian rule somewhat straitly , and being , so far as the Bible was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among their hearers . It was , however , only somewhat later that they began to suffer the consequences of the quarrel of slaveholders with their aroused consciences . Jacob Gruber , of whom we shall speak again as a somewhat eccentric and witty character , was also a most sincere and faithful preacher . At a camp-meeting where he officiated , he spoke very plainly against the sin of slaveholding . He was arrested and brought to trial . It was at this trial that our present Chief Justice , Mr. Taney , appeared as counsel for the defendant , and uttered sentiments which have often since been quoted in the great controversy in our land . He spoke of slavery as " a blot on our national character , " and one that every real lover of freedom confidently hoped would be effectually , though gradually , wiped away . " And , " said he , " until the time shall come when we can point without a blush to the language of the Declaration of Independence , every friend of humanity will seek to lighten the galling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his power , the wretched condition of the slave . " * He defended the freedom of speech and of the pulpit in an eloquent manner , and set forth the petty malignity which had prompted the prosecution . Mr. Gruber was readily acquitted by the jury , but was subjected to an onerous expense , and greatly interrupted in his labor . This was forty-three years ago . Ministers in slaveholding sections since that time have grown more quiescent ; yet even now , in some parts of the country , trouble on this score has not ceased , and within a year or two , before the outbreak of the present conflict , several preachers have suffered death by Lynch law in the Southwest , on the mere suspicion of anti-slavery . One is struck with surprise at the scanty pittance with which these preachers managed to supply their necessities . It is true their expenses were not very great , yet they must have clothes and horses , with the needful travelling apparatus ; // and there were exigencies out of which it would require even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for daily sustenance , both for man and beast , that could usually be obtained without payment among the people . Some of the ministers inherited property , and thus had something to fall back on . Most of them , for several years after the beginning of their ministry , remained unmarried . A large proportion who did marry were obliged to locate . Many of these spent a few years in the securing of a farm and home for their families , and then returned eagerly to the work . Quite a considerable number followed the example of St. Paul , and , though allowing that it was right for others to marry , deemed it inexpedient for themselves . For a long period it was almost out of the question to be an itinerant preacher and support a family , unless property had been secured from other sources . These sacrifices were cheerfully borne , but they were sacrifices nevertheless . Among the reminiscences of Rev. George Roberts , who was a native of Maryland , but one of the early itinerants in New England , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never received over forty dollars per annum , including the scanty dividends from certain trust-funds at the disposal of the Conference . On one occasion when he arrived at the seat of the Conference , Bishop Asbury pushed the rather gaunt saddlebags of Roberts with his cane , and said , " George , where are your clothes ? " " On my back , Bishop , " said George . " When I get my appointment at your hand , sir , I shall not have to return to my circuit for my clothes , but am ready at a moment 's warning to go whithersoever you direct . " Elijah R. Sabine , of whom a sketch is communicated for Dr. Sprague 's volume , by his son , Hon. Lorenzo Sabine , was a member of the New England Conference at a time when it embraced nearly all the territory indicated by its name . Though a man of small advantages in early life , never attending school after he was eight years old , by the diligent use of such scanty opportunities as he had , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preacher . His second cii ' ; cuit was in the northern part of New Hampshire , and in such // an unexplored region that it was some time after receiving his appointment before he could find any one to direct him where he might find it . Among his hardships are mentioned those of journeying for an entire day without food , and of sleeping in the forest , with his horse tied to a tree , and his own head resting on his saddlebags . The seventies of his experience impaired his health , so that he was obliged for a time to desist from travelling . Regaining his health , and having married in the mean time , he was appointed a Presiding Elder over a large part of the State of Vermont . It was a renewal of the old toil . Other difficulties too presented themselves . Though occupying a high ecclesiastical office , his receipts for the year amounted to scarcely more than fifty dollars ; this , too , when he had a wife and two children to support . Happily for them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average of the preachers ' salaries , as reported at one of these Conferences , amounted to forty-eight dollars for one year , and for another to sixty-two , for single preachers , and from seventy-five to one hundred and twenty dollars for married men . " One minister , who travelled more than three thousand miles on horseback , received just one dollar and four cents , and again five dollars and thirty-three cents more than his expenses . " These were the earliest times , it must be remembered . Those preachers who came later found a more remunerative field , though never as yet reckoned greatly lucrative anywhere . We intended to dwell somewhat upon the extensive usefulness of some of these men , and the extraordinary results of their labors . But our limited space will permit only a bare allusion to this feature . There is the less need of dwelling on it , as a ready inference will be drawn from other general facts exhibited . The growth of the denomination within fourscore years to be the largest in the country , would perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it would be exceedingly interesting to trace individual examples of success . It is not wonderful that great effects followed the efforts of such men as we have described and are about to describe . The consequences will appear still more natural , when we reflect that their mission was chiefly to desti // tute populations , of whom , though some were indifferent and others hostile , not a few were eager for religious instruction . In the more settled regions of the country their appeal was to the poor , and to those who for one cause or another stood aloof from existing religious organizations , or were disaffected toward them , or to such as found their wants better met in the more simple , spiritual , and practical doctrines presented . But there were some among these preachers of equally eminent gifts and indefatigable zeal , like Valentine Cook , in Virginia ; John Kobler , one of the first to publish the Gospel in the wilds of Ohio ; Thomas Branch , whose last sickness and death occurred in a region of such utter loneliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his place of burial , but who , when too feeble to leave his bed , still held meetings which resulted in the establishment of a church in the place and a great religious influence in all the region ; Jesse Walker , who " took St. Louis , " then an exceedingly wicked city , and for a long time impervious even to his powerful assaults ; Jesse Lee , Joseph Lybrand , and John Brodhead , and so many others that time would fail us to mention them . Amid all the trials , self-denials , and hardships , notwithstanding the solemn mission in which they were engaged , and the almost terrible earnestness with which they exhorted men to " flee from the wrath to come , " there was nevertheless a spirit of hearty good-nature , of genuine cheerfulness , clearly discernible . The wit and humor of Methodist preachers is proverbial , and it is hardly expected to find a company of them together without a considerable exhibition of these qualities . The very character of their adventures , and the severity of their toils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspire this disposition ; and then their religious convictions were of that happy , confident kind which implies a right to all the really good things furnished by Providence . Many are the cases in point which we find in the volumes before us and elsewhere . Jacob Gruber , of whom we have before spoken , was of German descent , though born in this country . His wit was of a satirical character , and not particularly palatable to the objects of it . He was a devoted , laborious , and successful minister , 5* // and possessed much influence both with the ministry and the laity . But he had a great contempt for " new-fangled notions , " worldly fashions , and for all artificiality and pretension , - frequently almost outraging propriety in rebuking them . He was particularly severe on ministers who were more conspicuous by their elegance , learning , and worldly ambition , than by their zeal or success in saving souls . The following we find in a biography of Mr. Gruber by Dr. Strickland . He was at a camp-meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the clergy being present , he took the occasion to give them a few hints . He chose for his subject the conversion of Saul . The following is the introduction . " A great many years ago a bold blasphemer was smitten by conviction , when on his way to Damascus to persecute the Christians . He was taken to Damascus in great distress . Ananias , after hearing of the concern of mind under which Saul was laboring , started out to find him . It seems he was stopping at the house of a gentleman by the name of Judas , not Judas Iscariot , for that person had been dead several years . The residence of this gentleman was in the street which was called Strait . I suppose it was the main street , or Broadway , of the city , and hence it was not difficult to find . Arriving at the mansion , he rang the bell , and soon a servant made her appearance . He addressed her thus : Is the gentleman of the house , Mr. Judas , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is at home . ' Taking out a glazed card , on which was printed , Rev. Mr. Ananias , ' he handed it to the servant , and said , Take this card to him quickly . ' Taking a seat , with his hat , cane , and gloves in his left hand , his right being employed in arranging his classical curls , so as to present as much of an intellectual air as possible , he awaited an answer . Presently Mr. Judas made his appearance , whereupon Mr. Ananias rises , and , making a graceful bow , says , Have I the honor to address Mr. Judas ? ' That is my name , sir ; please be seated . ' I have called , Mr. Judas , to inquire if a gentleman by the name of Mr. Saul , a legate oC the high-priest at Jerusalem , is a guest at your house ? ' Yes sir ; Mr. Saul is in his chamber , in very great distress and trouble of mind . He was brought here yesterday , having fallen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jerusalem road . ' 0 , I am very sorry to hear of so painful an accident . I hope he is not dangerously wounded . ' No sir , I think not , though the fall has affected his sight very much , and he complains considerable and prays a good deal . ' Well , I am very sorry ; but that is // not very strange , as I believe he belongs to that sect of the Jews called Pharisees , who make much of praying . How long since he received this fall , Mr. Judas ? ' About three days since , and all the time he has not taken any refreshment or rest . ' Indeed ! you do n't say so ! he must be seriously hurt . May I be permitted to see Mr. Saul ? ' I will ascertain his pleasure , Mr. Ananias , and let you know if you can have an interview . ' After being gone a short time , Mr. Judas returns and says , Mr. Saul will be much pleased to see you . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reclining on a couch in a room partially darkened . Approaching him , Ananias says , How do you do , Mr. Saul ? I understood you had done our city the honor of a visit . Hope you had a pleasant journey . How did you leave all the friends at Jerusalem ? How did you leave the high-priest ? We have very fine weather , Mr. Saul . I thought I would call and pay my respects to you , as I was anxious to have some conversation with you on theological subjects . I am extremely sorry to hear of the accident that happened to you in visiting our city , and hope you will soon recover from your indisposition . ' " All this and more he is said to have delivered in his German style , acting it oat in a manner so ludicrous that the audience could scarcely repress their laughter. * Sometimes his indignation carried him to an almost sacrilegious extreme . In the time of the last war with Great Britain , being called on to offer prayer on some public occasion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sovereigns of Europe , - convert their souls , - give them short lives atid happy deaths , - take them to heaven , and let us have no more of them . " Sometimes the biter was bitten . While residing at Lewiston he used to come in frequent contact with the Catholic priest , who was not much behind him in the use of edged tools . Meeting the priest one day , not as usual on horseback , but trudging on foot , Gruber said : " Where s your horse ? Why do n't you ride ? " " 0 , ' , said the other , " the beast is * A young preacher , desirous of improving his style as a pulpit orator , and having great confidence in Gruber , at that time his presiding elder , wrote to him for advice . The young man had contracted the bad habit of prolonging his words , especially when excited . Deeming this a principal defect , Gruber wrote him as follows - " Dear-ah Brother-ah , - When-ab you-ah go-ah to-ah preach-ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAcoB-AH GRUBER-AH. " // dead . " " Dead ? Well I suppose he is in purgatory . " " Nay , the wretched creature turned Methodist just before he died , and went straight to hell ! " Hope Hull was one of the pioneers of the denomination in Georgia , and his fame was very extensive in that section . He was not at all a facetious man , but his wonderful penetration into character , together with his honest directness in dealing with souls , sometimes gave to his language all the appositeness of genuine wit . On one occasion , while a circuit missionary , after preaching he met the class , or members of the society , and spoke with them , as is customary , respecting their religious experience . After going through with the members , he turned to an elderly man sitting apart , and inquired after his spiritual state . The old gentleman , after some hesitation , replied : " I am like old Paul , - when I would do good , evil is present with me . " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are like old Noah too , - get drunk sometimes ! " He was a perfect stranger to him , but it was a centre shot ; for the poor old man was a drunkard . Billy Hibbard was one of the most eccentric of characters , but withal a most agreeable person , and a man of unbounded and universal good-will . Of large general information , with an ease of manner which made him equally at home in the highest and in the lowest circles , his remarkable powers of conversation and exuberant yet sensible pleasantry , together with his enterprising religious zeal , made him wonderfully popular and successful in his calling . No man was ever a heartier Arminian than he , and the " Five Points " of Calvinism were almost always sure to receive a blow somewhere in his sermon , no matter what the theme or the text . Yet he was always on the most intimate terms with the preachers of the antagonistic theology . " Brother Hibbard , " said a good Presbyterian friend , " you hurt my feelings yesterday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do that ? " He referred him to some doctrinal remark in the discourse . " 0 , " said Hibbard , " I m sorry you took that , - I meant that for the Devil , and you have stepped in and taken the blow . Do n't get between me and the Devil , Brother , and then you wo n't get hurt . " // On one occasion he had a newspaper controversy on some theological topic with Dr. Lyman Beecher , the disputants being personally strangers . Not long after , while journeying on horseback in Connecticut , the two met . Mr. Beecher suspected his companion to be a preacher , but could not draw out the . fact by any indirect conversation , till he asked him plumply , " Are you not a minister of the Gospel ? " " I am , " said Hubbard . " Do you belong to the standing order ? " " No , I belong to the kneeling order . " So characteristic a reply unmistakably indicated Billy Hubbard to the shrewd mind of his interlocutor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus begun was an amicable one . His ready wit seldom failed him . Once , when the roll-call of the Conference gave his name as William , he arose and objected to answering to that name , insisting that his name was Billy . " Why , Brother Hibbard , " said Bishop Asbury , " Billy is a little boy 's name . " " Yes , Bishop , " he replied , " and I was a little boy when my father gave it to me . " This quality in these pioneer preachers was by no means a rare one , and it sometimes became a most effective weapon , whether in silencing an antagonist , repulsing a caviller , or giving zest to social intercourse . Of Jesse Lee , the early apostle of Methodism in New England , it is related that one day , while travelling on horseback , he fell in with two lawyers , who , taking a place on each side of him , began to quiz him . They asked if he was a man of liberal education . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . " They inquired if he wrote his sermons . He replied in the negative . " But do you not sometimes make mistakes , for instance , in quoting Scripture ? " " Perhaps so , sometimes , but not often . " " When you find you have made a mistake , do you correct it ? " " Not always ; if it involves nothing essential , I let it pass . The other day I tried to repeat the passage where it says the Devil is a liar , and the father of them ' ; I got it , The Devil is a lawyer , and the father of them ' ; but I hardly thought it necessary to rectify so unimportant an error . " By this time one of the young sprigs was prompted to remark to the other , that he hardly knew whether the fellow was a knave or a fool . Lee glanced meaningly on either hand , and replied , " Perhaps // between the two . " The young gentlemen by this time concluded to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of these men is a thoroughly interesting study . The early educational advantages of the first generation or two were next to nothing at all , as is very well understood . Graduates as they facetiously termed themselves of " Brush College " or " Swamp University , " that many of them became men of marked intellectual power is a fact that may be affirmed of them in common with other classes of our countrymen , who have been well educated , but not in the schools . In the words of the venerable Judge McLean , who by the way contributes a large number of valuable sketches to Dr. Sprague 's volume - " It is matter of astonishment to many who have become intimately acquainted with Methodist preachers who have travelled frontier circuits , where books were scarce , and the preaching-places remote from each other , how they could have made such progress as they actually have done in useful knowledge . One secret of it no doubt is , that they have been diligent students of the book of nature , which is always open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much in exchanging a rugged thought for the flippancy of a college phrase . " The remark , though not novel , is none the less true ; yet there are other facts to be takeii in connection with it . A. very large proportion of these men commenced their public labors early in life , frequently before they were twenty years of age . Few of them had ever looked forward to the vocation of a preacher more than six months before they found themselves engaged in the work . Awakened to a sense of their religious wants , sometimes from a state of utter indifference , or even in a course of abandoned wickedness ; experiencing a wonderful change in their views of life , their relations to God , and their inward experience ; seized with an intense desire to induce in others the same joyous life upon which they had themselves entered , - they began by quiet efforts at personal influence , by simple exhortations in social meetings , and so gradually , almost without intention of their own , they went on to exhorting in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ability which , encouraged by spiritual advisers , they did not feel at liberty to leave unemployed . It will be readily seen , that a mind which , while kept free from fanaticism , should be pervaded by a healthy religious consciousness , and burning with a desire for usefulness , would be roused to vigorous activity , and would thus come into the fittest condition for the reception of all kinds of truth , and the natural development of all its powers . Then the circumstances into which the young itinerant was necessarily thrown - the taking of important responsibilities , being brought into peculiar exigencies , compelled to think rapidly , to decide summarily , and to exercise all possible ingenuity - were decidedly the best school for the strengthening of the judgment and the attainment of all the highest mental qualities . Then , as Judge McLean remarks , the book of nature was more intimately present with him than with the inmate of the cloister . He read from its open pages , in the original language , a language which he was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh fact that he would have sought in vain in the bookish translations . In his keen encounters with men , he had learned ten thousand things which are hidden from ordinary eyes . There was likely , too , to be nurtured by this hardy discipline a healthy body , a well-developed muscular frame , with large , strong lungs , a vigorous circulation , and no uncomfortable consciousness of a " nervous system , " - in fine , the most suitable dwelling-place and workshop for a mind of substantial vigor and wisdom . We recollect very well hearing one of the bishops at a Methodist Conference a few years ago , in addressing the candidates for ordination , relate the incident of a young man who commenced preaching in one of the Middle States . He was on a large circuit , under the superintendence of an older preacher . The latter , as in duty bound , in his travels about the circuit , inquired after the welfare and reputation of his colleague among the societies . He heard a good report of the piety , self-devotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one member ventured to suggest to the elder , that they were a little puzzled at the fact which they had ascertained , that that young man always read the same Scripture // lesson at family prayers . The elder candidly spoke with his junior brother on the subject , and delicately inquired the reason . The young man burst into tears , and confessed that that was the only chapter which he had learned to read well enough to read before others , though he was diligently studying the Bible . He continued to study the Bible and other sources of knowledge as he had opportunity , and grew in mental as in spiritual stature . He has since been among the most gifted ministers of his denomination , and at the time when the bishop related the anecdote was filling one of the most important city appointments in the country , - a man not unknown to fame . There are numerous instances in Dr. Sprague 's volume which strikingly illustrate this principle of self-help , - so many that our chief difficulty is in making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England preachers is that of Orange Scott , who with a lofty religious ambition combined that spirit of enterprise not uncommon among our young men . His parents were poor , hard-working people . His advantages in youth were exceedingly limited . His whole schooling amounted to only about thirteen months , and this probably of not the most profitable kind . His religions opportunities were scarcely even as good as his literary . He stayed away from the house of worship altogether , for want of decent apparel . But though his ideas were at the best vague and confused , his conscience was sometimes active , and the conviction of his bad moral condition often filled him with gloomy apprehensions as to the future . At length , one day in solitude , his relations to God and eternity presented themselves with such appalling distinctness , that he determined to make religion thenceforth , his chief concern , and not to rest till he found satisfactory evidence of a right position . He was scarcely more than twenty years of age when , his natural powers of exhortation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a license , and was soon engaged in preaching . His appearance at first , we have rcason to believe , was exceedingly awkward , yet there was clearly much talent under the rough exterior , and this gradually developed itself . He had a strong mind , quick perceptive facul // ties , a laborious disposition , and a great ambition to learn . He rapidly improved . He became one of the most effective preachers in the denomination , He was a man of strong physical frame , of excellent vocal powers , of great common-sense , and much influence among the masses , over whom he was peculiarly fitted for chieftainship . " I have heard him preach at camp-meetings , " says Dr. Stevens , " with almost superhuman power , - his noble voice sending its trumpet-blasts afar through the forests , and the multitudes of hearers waving under its spell like trees under the gale . " He was a skilful debater , and his influence in the General Conference , of which he was several times a member , was very great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , and became a writer of no mean ability . He was for some time the editor of a denominational paper , and published several works of considerable value . In the anti-slavery agitation he was conspicuous and influential , and was a prime mover in a secession from the Church in 1842 , ( occasioned chiefly by the slavery contro. * versy , ) which resulted in the organization of the Wesleyan Methodist Connection . He died in 1847 , in the forty-eighth year of his age . Equally noticeable is the career of Martin IRuter , a native of Worcester County , Massachusetts . With only the ordinary advantages of a common-school education , his natural appetite for knowledge led him to persist in its acquisition , though under many difficulties . His religious tastes and convictions brought him into the Methodist ministry when scarcely more than fifteen years old . His first circuits were of the roughest and most laborious kind , so that one wonders how anybody could ever have thought of systematic study in connection with toils and privations which were in themselves hardly credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most success-* ful manner , quickly giving evidence of uncommon attainments and mental power . Before he was thirty-three lie was honored with the degree of Master of Arts , and at thirty-five with that of Doctor of Divinity . He was President of Augusta* College in Kentucky , and afterward of Alleghany College in Pennsylvania , which latter position he left to take the superintendence of the ecclesiastical mission in Texas , a work of great // importance . His excessive labors there induced a disease of which he died while yet far from being an old man . He had written nearly a dozen different volumes , some of them works of much merit . Still more remarkable is the story of the life of Henry B. Bascom , late a bishop in the Methodist Episcopal Church South , of whom we shall have more to say in another connection . Doubtless the eulogy on Dr. Bascom by his enthusiastic friend , Mr. Milburn , in " The Rifle , Axe , and Saddlebags , " is both highly poetical and somewhat extravagant ; yet the facts justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " had never received three months ' schooling in his life . " We have reason to consider this a mistake ; but his opportunities certainly can not have been great , and we find him while yet in his teens riding some of the wildest circuits in Western Virginia , Ohio , and Kentucky . How a man could become a strong thinker and a mighty preacher while ranging through those vast solitudes , sleeping many a night in the forest , or lodging in log-huts where a single apartment contained the parents , with their offspring of from ten to fifteen souls , - or bodies at any rate , - with such domestic animals as are likely to share in all the immunities of a backwoodsman 's fireside , - is not so very strange ; but that a man should undertake a scholastic course of study , should essay Greek , Latin , Hebrew , mathematics , natural science , is beyond our comprehension . Yet we are told that Mr. Bascom did all this , and persevered in it till he became a classical scholar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he became one of the very strongest men in his own Church , and one of the most powerful preachers in the country . Several of the earlier bishops - Dr. Bascom 's bishopric was of very recent date - were men whose intellectual character was formed in the same school , and after much the same method . Young men engaged in agricultural or mechanical pursuits , with the scanty educational advantages of a newlysettled country , called suddenly into a solemnly responsible work , and feeling the importance of putting all their possible force into that work , they assiduously cultivated their minds by such reading as they could get , by careful observation , by deep // METHODIST CLERICAL BIOGRAPHY . reflection and systematic thought , while on their lonely journeys , till , almost without suspecting it , they had become men of really great minds , some of them kings in the realms of thought . It might be interesting , would our limits permit , to trace the lives of McKendree , Roberts , and iledding ; and yet , as illustrations of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education , it would be little more than a repetition of the story so often told . Our article would be quite incomplete without some allusion to the eloquence of this department of the American pulpit . It is very generally admitted that the best features of what is properly called popular oratory are nowhere more amply exhibited than here . Many of the early preachers , be it remembered , began as mere talkers on a subject which seemed to them of intense importance . They had no thought of becoming orators , or even speech-makers . Yet the simplicity and zeal with which they exhorted , by continual practice , made many of them , if not orators , yet powerful and effective preachers . They had not much to say about " moral beauty , " " necessary relations , " " philosophical demonstrations , " " a priori and a posteriori arguments " ; or of " being saved on general principles , " of " volition , " " moral obligation , " or " intellectual processes and active powers . " They were apt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to paint their pictures sometimes in not very flattering colors , and to set forth their danger in* such wise as often to make the flesh to creep ; and then , turning round , would present the great remedy , and tenderly urge upon them the love of the Saviour , and the freedom of his grace to all on the same condition . Of those who might be properly called eloquent , few were trained rhetoricians . They had all the good qualities which we attribute to stump-speaking in its best estate , - the freedom , directness , complete self-command , as well as complete command of the audience , - with as little of vulgar trickery and coarse feeling as we should expect from the nature of the vocation and other circumstances . Untrammelled with any manuscript , looking their auditors right in the face , never ready to fire , as they sometimes expressed it , " till they could see the white of the hearers ' eyes , " always preferring the broad open // Jan. day to the lamp-illumined evening , and hating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as being less religious because more dim , many of these preachers produced wonderful effects by their utterances , and some of them were men whose eloquence has scarcely been surpassed by trained or untrained orators , ancient or modern . They realized what Henry Rogers gives as a brief definition of the truest style of eloquence , - " practical reasoning , animated by strong emotion " ; or , as he more fully describes it , " reasoning on topics calculated to inspire a common interest , expressed in the language of ordinary life , and in that brief , rapid , familiar style which natural emotion ever assumes . " In speaking of the individual examples of eloquence furnished by the Methodist pulpit , we wish to discriminate between those whose oratory was the product of nature , and those whose native powers were aided by culture . To be sure , no such exact classification can be made ; for eloquence will not exist in any remarkable degree , however great the natural predisposition , without some culture ; nor , on the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following of which will certainly make a man an orator . Orator fit , probably enough ; but there must be oratorical material to start with . Bishop McKendree , we are informed in the graceful sketch by Judge McLean , was in the highest sense an eloquent man . " With great simplicity and grace of delivery he united a force and beauty of illustration that approached nearer to the Sermon on the Mount than I ever heard from any one else . A child could understand him , and at the same time he commanded the profoundest attention of the learned . What he said was always so appropriate to the subject , and was uttered with so much ease and grace , that every hearer was ready to conclude that he could himself say the same thing . And yet no one could imitate his manner ,  --  could imitate the persuasiveness and beautiful simplicity with which he set forth the truths of the Gospel . When roused by his subject , his mind expanded , and seemed to possess an inspiration almost without limit . His metaphors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they came in their divinest forms at his bidding . Heaven , earth , and hell were the instruments of his eloquence . On one occasion , while preaching to many thousands at a camp-meeting in Ohio , he was describing the miseries of the lost , a strain in which he seldom indulged . But so appalling was his descrip // tion that the whole congregation involuntarily rose from their seats , with eyes fixed on the preacher , and with a ghastly paleness of countenance that betokened absolute consternation . Observing the overwhelming effect , he paused a moment , and then , with a loud but soothing tone of voice , thanked God that his hearers were not in the world of woe ; and a shout instantly went up from the multitude , which must have been heard at a great distance . It was the involuntary shout of deliverance . " - Annals , p. 171 . We had designed to give some description of Bishop George , and had marked a specimen illustrative of his pulpit power ; but are compelled to omit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is also sketched by Judge McLean , was for about fifty years a preacher and a man of vast influence in the connection . He might not perhaps have been termed eloquent in the strictest sense of that term ; yet it was the remark of men of the most enlarged experience and observation , " We have heard greater preachers than Mr. Collins , but we never heard one we liked so well . " His chief and perpetual theme was love , - love to God and man . " Those who knew him , in going to hear him expected a feast , and they were seldom disappointed . His mind not unfrequently became full of the inspiration of his subject , and on such occasions he rose to a height of impressive eloquence rarely surpassed . These efforts were never premeditated . They were of a character which neither study nor mere ingenuity could ever attain . They were at once so spiritual and lofty as to seem to have no connection with mere material things . " His appearance was so impressive as at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak , but its intonations were soft , sweet , and touching . " It was what we readily conceive as perfection in utterance , though it may not beso easy to describe it . " His gestures were few and unstudied . In the sketch before us there is an account , by an Eastern traveller , of a discourse once heard from Mr. Collins on the parable of the Prodigal Son . We have not room for the entire narrative , and we fear the effect of an attempt at condensation ; but a passage or two may help the conception . He illustrated the love of the Heavenly Father by the love of earthly parents for their offsp*ring , even when disobedient , and 6* // unfilial , and by the joy with which the penitent child is received . The tenderness and pathos with which this was done affected the audience wonderfully , and the writer remarks , it put him on an involuntary review of his early life , to recall any unkind word , action , or look toward his parents . " I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me were similarly employed . " Then the preacher told a story of a poor widow 's child lost in the wilderness , of which he himself was cognizant , having accompanied the mother in search of the little one , while scores of others were scattered on the same business . The details were given with a circumstantiality of thrilling interest , though the speaker seemed quite unconscious of any attempt at the oratorical effect which his method of telling the story was sure to produce . The extensive prairie , the dark night , the lanterns and torches , the tin horns , the cold rain beginning to fall , the beasts of prey , the almost hopeless task at first , the almost abandonment after many hours ' search by all but the agonized mother , the repeated effort , the faint sound of the distant horn echoed by others proclaiming to the mother that her child is found , - were all pictured to the ear better than the most skilful painter could have done it to the eye . " It was too much . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some sobbed outright , and attempted in vain to conceal their emotions . " " In fine , " says the same writer , " I have come to the conclusion that the British Spy only dreamed of a pulpit orator , - that it was left for me to behold one . " A remarkable preacher was James Russell , of the South Carolina Conference . Left an orphan at an early age , of an obscure family , the poor , friendless , ignorant boy became interested in religion when about sixteen years of age , and realized the mighty impulse , intellectual as well as moral , which a genuine Christian experience usually communicates . He soon gave proof in the social meetings of extraordinary powers as a , speaker . Yet his first application for a license was rejected for want of qualification . And no wonder ; for we learn that , when afterward the license was reluctantly granted , he could scarcely read or spell . On his first circuit he carried a spelling-book with him , and studied his Bible by // aid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to succeed , and was not ashamed to ask even the boys of the families where he lodged for help in his studies . He mastered his early difficulties , and advanced with a steady , swift pace in learning . His command of language became wonderful ; his taste was purified ; his intellect was trained ; his stores of information were large and completely at his command ; and comparatively early in life he stood foremost among the great lights of the Southern pulpit . There is a fine description of his oratorical character by Dr. Olin , in the Annals , from which we must content ourselves with quoting a very few passages . " A leading excellency of his preaching consisted in his peculiar felicity of expression . His style was always adapted to the genius of his congregation . Not that he was such a master of language as to be able to rise and fall with the ever-varying intellectual standard of his auditory ; but whilst his choice of words and structure of sentences were seldom displeasing to a cultivated ear , they were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His rhetoric , as well as his logic , was that of common sense and common life . For both he was much indebted to books . Reading had disciplined his mind and purified his taste ; but it had left no other vestiges on his public performances . The rich treasures he gathered from various quarters were all subjected to the crucible Nothing could exceed the simplicity and efficiency of his rhetorical machinery . His manner was to conduct his hearers into scenes with which they were daily conversant , and then to point out the analogy which existed between the point he would establish and the objects before them . His comparisons were derived not only from rural and pastoral scenes , whence ' the poets gather their flowers , but from all the common arts of life , from the processes and utensils of the kitchen , and the employments of housewifery and husbandry . The aptness and force of his metaphors always atoned for their occasional meanness ; and it was apparent to all , that they were dictated by a shrewd acquaintance with the human heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocks of electricity . I once heard him preach upon the Opening of the Books at the final judgment , when he presented the records of human iniquity in a light so clear and overwhelming , that the thousands who were listening to him started back and turned pale , as if the appalling vision had actually burst upon their view . " - pp. 412 , 413 . One prominent quality of many of these preachers was their // METHODIST CLERICAL BIOGRAPHY . readiness in any emergency . Some of them could be called at five minutes ' notice , the subject furnished by the immediate occasion , and the result would be the most wonderful imaginable . George Dougherty , of South Carolina , was one of this class . We should be glad had we space to give a full portrait of his character . An instance is given of his skill as an impromptu speaker . It was at a camp-meeting , where , as used sometimes to be the case , a great many disorderly persons had come and occupied the adjacent forest , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cursed , and fought , and perpetrated other enormities of an outrageous character . There was no especial legal protection for those holding the meeting , and matters had to be managed by the ingenuity of the ministers . On the Sabbath of the meeting referred to , these lawless fellows having been reinforced during a sermon of a somewhat exciting character , " they broke forth from every shady grove and from every point of the compass , and came thundering into the camp with the tramp of a herd of buffaloes , thus producing a scene of the utmost confusion and tumult . " With some difficulty quiet was partially restored ; the first sermon , meanwhile , being concluded , was about to be followed by another . The time and circumstances seemed to the managers of the meeting to call for Dougherty , and he promptly responded to the call . Waiving the introductory service , he proceeded directly to the sermon . He took for his text : " And the herd ran violently down a steep place into the lake , and were choked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his subject in the order of thought suggested by the text : First , the herd into which the devils enter ; secondly , the drivers employed ; and , thirdly , the market they are going to . " " And then commenced his expose ' of the infernal entrances into men , and the agencies employed , under the figure of drivers , in the establishment of brothels , drinking-saloons , gambling-stalls , and other similar auxiliaries to ruin It was pertinent , awful , loving , scathing , and unique . It was the attack of a master mind in a last resort , and was entirely successful . He swept along his pathway , like a blazing comet , drawing sii**h lifelike pictures of vice and diabolical intrigue that the miserable creatures before him seemed spell-bound. // When he reached his imaginary market with them , the end of an abandoned life the picture took on such an appalling hue that an involuntary shudder evidently came over the audience , - you seemed to see them in successive columns disappearing from mortal view , and sinking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be overwhelmed with amazement , - and as the preacher began to draw in his lines upon them , to see if anything had been accomplished , they left in wild confusion , and were soon en route for home . " - Annals , p. 295 . Leaving the class of those who may with propriety be called natural orators , we must refer briefly to a few out of many of those whose original power had been rendered more efficient and noticeable by culture and the appliances of art . Among those whose fame was very brilliant twenty or thirty years ago , and whom thousands now remember with great admiration , are the names of Summerfield , Maffit , and Cookman . They were all of foreign birth ; still the fact that to some extent they received their development and acquired their reputation here demands for them a passing notice among the celebrities of the American pulpit . John Summerfield came to this country from England , in 1821 , when about twenty-three years of age . He had commenced preaching when scarcely nineteen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrival in New York , he was invited to speak at the Anniversary of the American Bible Society , and his address before an immense audience was regarded by competent judges as one of the highest efforts of platform eloquence . It was not long before his popularity became so great , that any place in which it was known that lie was to speak would be thronged long before the hour of service , and in more than one instance the avenues to the pulpit were so closed up that he was obliged to enter through a window . In his personal appearance there was everything engaging and attractive , He had a good figure , rather slight , and little below the medium stature . " His face was pre-eminently a speaking one ; it seemed like the play of sunbeams , as it brightened under his intense and varied emotions . " His delivery was perfectly simple and natural , his tones instinct with melody , his gesture the result of the workings of the // spirit within , and nothing else . He had a wonderful command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scriptural incidents . Perhaps , after all , the greatest characteristic of his eloquence was the deep , fervent , solemn , yet cheerful , religious spirit with which he was imbued . He seemed an incarnate angel to some of his admirers , and his tongue was as if it had been touched with the sacred fire . His constitution was frail , and he suffered intensely from disease . His light was almost preternaturally brilliant , but it was prematurely extinguished , for he died at the age of twenty-seven . John Newland Maffit was born in Ireland , and came to this country not far from the same time with Summerfield . His career was much longer than the other 's , and hence he was more extensively known . His preaching attracted immense crowds . There was an indescribable charm about his manner , to which person , attitude , gesture , voice , and countenance all contributed . He was not characterized by the religious spirit to the same extent as Summerfield , and his success might probably be attributed to the action of natural and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so powerful and effective in some other preachers . There was in him comparatively little of the masculine force which carries the audience by strength ; he was rather winning , persuasive , inspiring , taking captive the hearts of all his hearers . People would enthusiastically admire Mr. Maffit ; they would be profoundly affected by what Mr. Summerfield said . George G. Cookman had a character , as a preacher , somewhat different from either Maffit or Summerfield . His mind was of a more logical structure , and his discourse more weighty . His intellectual training , though not thoroughly classical , was , nevertheless , such as laid a fitting foundation for great mental efficiency . He was prompt , vigorous , and vivacious , and not only an eloquent preacher , but almost unsurpassed as a platform speaker . His voice was a remarkable one , and though he evidently never disciplined nor governed himself by the technical rules of elocution , yet his delivery was one chief source of his power . His manner of reading a hymn or a passage of Scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surely to bring out a new meaning , or produce an impression never felt before . He was one of the passengers in the ill-fated President , and was never heard of after he sailed for England . The manner of his death has reminded many of his friends of a peculiarity of his preaching . It is said that his discourse was almost always enriched by impressive figures drawn from the sea . His allusions to storms and shipwrecks were among his grandest efforts , and so vivid and graphic were his descriptions that his hearers often lost themselves , and seemed actually present in the imaginary scenes . His farewell sermon while Chaplain of Congress , not a great while before his embarkation , was on the text , " And the sea gave up the dead which were in it . " Among these dead he took his place in the forty-first year of his age , and the fifteenth of his ministry . We have already spoken of Bishop Bascom in another connection , and have intimated the main features of his character . Henry Clay - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most eloquent man he ever heard open his lips . His fine natural powers had been cultivated diligently and extensively , though under serious disadvantages . He was not merely a good elocutionist with a soaring imagination , but a scholarly and well-read minister . A susceptible and impressible mind , disporting itself amid such grand natural scenery as we have seen that the fields of his youthful labors presented to the eye , was not likely to be unaffected by it . " Scenes such as these no doubt laid the foundation in his mental constitution of the marked peculiarities of his pulpit style ; - a lofty independence of thought , an exuberant and daring imagination , a style of address which , indifferent to the conventional proprieties of minor criticism , made laws for itself ; a concentrated , impassioned excitement , - glowing , thundering , overpowering in its pauseless vehemence . " - Annals , p. 638 . The writer of the above , Dr. Wightman , also speaks of a sermon he once heard from Bascom , on the text , " Behold the Lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . " " In his style you missed the elegant accuracy , the well-poised antithesis , the finish and polish which indicate the labor of lamp and file . You marked the want of that condensation , simplicity , and abstinence // from ornament which a masculine and cultivated taste would demand in a written discourse . But then this was not a written discourse , hut an oration ; and , accordingly , you had all the action of an impassioned extempore speaker , unfettered by manuscript or brief* ,  --  the living voice , with its ring of a clear , uplifted , angel trumpet , and the flashing eye , with its arrowy glance of piercing power Particular passages were overpowering in their effect . They were like the discharges of heavy ordnance . " - p. 539 . The most conspicuous of the Methodist clergy of New England , as well in great native powers thoroughly disciplined as in pulpit ability , was Stephen Olin , D. D. , late President of the Wesleyan University at Middletown , Connecticut . He was a native of Vermont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was teaching in the South that his thoughts were directed to the ministry , and he connected himself with a Southern Conference . He very soon distinguished himself as a preacher in his own denomination , and subsequently in other churches , and indeed attracted much attention while in England as a member of the Evangelical Alliance . Dr. Bates ( formerly President of Middlebury College ) , whose pupil he was while in college , and friend in after years , describes him as distinguished by " a certain iron grasp of mind and comprehensiveness of thought , by which he seized upon a whole subject at once , saw it in all its parts and bearings at a single glance , and presented it to the view of others in the fewest words and clearest manner possible . " This is an eminently true statement of a chief feature of his character . The one epithet which would naturally suggest itself as descriptive of him , to a person who should be in communion with him for even a few minutes , would be that of greatness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the word . The principal quality of his pulpit discourses was power . You felt as though a mighty mind was struggling with yours , and almost sure to prevail . He had few or none of what are called the graces of oratory . As he rose in the pulpit , you saw a person of uncommon height , a large but not very compact frame , massive head , broad shoulders , features strong and prominent , with a kindly expression , the eye , especially in later years , rather dull , but still pleasant . His voice was impressive , though not // musical , and to a stranger there might be a general appearance of awkwardness . But this was very soon forgotten , as indeed was everything else about the man , so completely did the subject absorb the attention . The first few sentences - often the very first - contained the germ of the whole discourse , which was developed with the greatest simplicity and naturalness , and yet frequently with surpassing grandeur . " The whole was a masterly unrolling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the starting-point , and which grew more lumiiious as the process went on , until it expanded into a glowing sphere of light . " We remember hearing him preach a baccalaureate sermon . It was in the last of July , on an intensely hot day . The spacious church was crowded in every part . He announced as his text : " I have written unto you , young men , because you are strong , " etc . He had no notes , and he evidently did not speak mernoriter . Very deliberately , as he commenced speaking , he shut the Bible , turned it round with its back to the audience , laid his spectacles on the desk , and in a natural but most noticeable manner proceeded with the work before him . We shall attempt no sketch of the discourse ; it may be found in full in his published works . There were no formal divisions in the sermon ; but there was a logical unfolding of a single great idea in all its bearings and ramifications . It was a grand hortatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fervid with strong emotion . Indeed , Dr. Olin was remarkable for the union of deep feeling with profound reasoning . The discourse continued for two hours and thirty-seven minutes , under circumstances which would have rendered an ordinary sermon of forty minutes tiresome ; yet the vast audience exhibited no signs of impatience , nor seemed to think the time long . He was a sufferer from disease for a great part of his life , and this deterred him from much of the public labor , both with pen and voice , for which lie was so remarkably fitted . He died in 1851 , at the age of fifty-nine . Extended as our personal sketches have already been , it would be unjust to close without a reference to Wilbur Fisk , who perhaps more than any other man occupied the hearts // of the people of his denomination . He was not endowed with the great native powers which pertained to Olin ; but he was a more active man . Like Olin , he was a native of Vermont , but was graduated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diligent culture , and much versatility , having nearly equal success as a teacher , a preacher , an administrator , and a controversialist . He was peculiarly fitted to win the hearts of the people , and was exceedingly popular as a pastor . To his efforts , in no small measure , was due the beginning of that energy which has of late years characterized the Methodists in the cause of education . He was the first principal of the oldest of their still living academies , and the first president of their first permanent college . As instructor , agent , president , or in whatever other office , he labored most heartily , faithfully , and self-sacrificingly ; and had the happiness , which all pioneers in such enterprises do not attain , of seeing his efforts produce abundant fruits . Greatly beloved while he lived by thousands of parishioners , students , and personal friends , he was lamented in death as few men are , and is remembered even now , after a lapse of twenty years , with the most lively affection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been confined , with a few exceptions , to those of the earlier generations of a denomination still young , - men who began , and for the most part finished , their work when the Church had no schools nor colleges , and when the general advantages of education were fewer by far than now : We have been gratified with the conviction , as we have been employed in penning these pages , that the various Christian churches - voluntary religious associations as they all are among us , and imperfect as all human combinations must be - have still been powerful in ministering to the national health , in shaping the character of the people , and in making a history worthy of the principles on which our government was founded .
