ARTICLE P1. - THE MEMOIR OF PRESIDENT WAYLAND . A Jifemoir of the Life and Lal*ors of Francis Wayland , D. D. , LI . D. , late President of Brown University . Including Selections from his Personal Reminiscences and Correspondence . By his Sons , Fu*&amp;NcIs WAYLAND , and II . L. WAYLAND . New York : Sheldon &amp; Company . 1867 . Two Vols. l2mo . ON the morning of the 18th of April , 1865 , millions of hearts were struck with consternation at the news of the assassination of Abraham Lincoln . At this time ten years had passed since Dr. Wayland 's resignation of the Presidency of Brown University ; and he was now living about a mile from the thickly settled portion of the city of Providence . At that moment of grief and alarm , the hearts of his fellow-citizens appeared to turn instinctively to him for counsel and comfort . As he was unable without imprudent exposure to attend a public meeting which was called for that evening , a large body of people , numbering not far from fifteen hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from a hastily erected platform near by he spoke to them of the lessons and duties of the hour . A more impressive evidence of the veneration that was felt for his character , and of the ascendency which he had gained over the hearts of the people among whom he had long resided , can hardly be imagined . Known only as an academical teacher , as a preacher , a philanthropist and a friend of the poor , there was yet something in him that corninanded the deep respect of practical men ,  --  men of the world , who often hold in light esteem the wisdom of scholars . Critics may form what estimate they will of Dr. Wayland as a philosopher , an author , a teacher ; it is impossible to ignore the significance of such a tribute to his personal power over the minds of others as this incident involves . Dr. Wayland was born of English parentage , his father and mother havhig emigrated to this country a few years before // his birth . Had they been passengers in the Mayflower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorough American in all the principles and affections of his heart . Both of his parents were singularly devout persons ; and his father was at length led to give up his occupation , which was that of a currier , and to devote himself to the work of preaching the Gospel . He became a Baptist pastor in good repute for practical sense , integrity , and piety ; and he lived to witness the fame and usefulness of his son . The son records in the " reminiscences " from which *his biographers have drawn copious extracts , that in one of his earliest schools the instruction was so far over his head , and given after so mechanical a method , that even the study of Geography became a meaningless exercise of memory . " Perhaps my experience here , " he adds , " was not altogether lost . It has at least served to impress me with the importance of doing everything in my power to bring whatever I attempted to teach within the understanding of the learner. *** us surviving sister remarks of him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was but two years the senior of the sister next him in age , yet , for some reason , he always seemed much older than the rest of us . When a mere boy , he was the companion of our mother . " Dr. Wayland had a peculiarity of mind and manner that made him alwtiys seem older t*ian he was . He was but thirty-two years old when he went to Providence to preside over the College ; yet one of his early pupils speaks of him , somewhere in the course of the Memoir , as even then styled by his students " the old Doctor , " - an appellation by which he was very frequiently designated in after years . Of course , this was chie*y owing to the standard in reference to youth and age which the young proceed upon , and which they find occasion constantly to modify as they themselves go forward in life ; yet not wholly to this cause . We remember to have heard from Dr. Nott an observation concerning his distinguished pupil , corroborative of the remark . we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wayland was admitted to the Sophomore Class , then in their third term , at Union College . He thinks that his mind was // not sufficiently mature to get the full benefit of the college course . " I was soon hurried , " he says , " into studies which I could not understand , and in which I had little interest . I was a pretty good reciter of what I understood dimly , or not at all . " * For Dr. Nott , th' President , he felt an enthusiastic reverence , which , though it sensibly abated , as would be natural in the lapse of years , was never lost . Late in life , he pronounces him the ablest man he had ever known intimately ; a man capable of making " himself distinguished in any department of science ; " and , in his prime , the most eloquent man he had ever heard.t Yet we are inclined to think that two men were hardly ever more unlike one another in their native tendencies than Nott and Wayland . The former , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core , and won his distinction in the pulpit mainly by a few sermons composed in the oratorical style of the French school of preachers . In his relations with men , he had the credit of possessing a certain skill and management which are as far distant as possible from the frank and homely directness of Wayland . The latter was not blind to the well known peculiarities of his revered " guide , philosopher , and friend . " " As the President of a College , " writes Dr. Wayland , " he devoted himself to its material prosperity . Had he sought more to improve its means of instruction and to teach its teachers , so that these means might be well employed , I think his success would have been greater . " " His power of influencing men led him also , I think , into errors . It led him to delight in doing things indirectly which might as well be done directly . " 4 The lasting influence of Dr. Nott is probably to be traced in some of Dr. Wayland 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussions of'the Senior recitations to the President at Brown . The rhetorical side of Dr. Nott was also not without a marked effect on his scholar , making him attentive in the early part of his career to the graces of composition , and appearing , probably , in the eloquent paragraphs of the Sermon on " The Moral Dignity of the Missionary Enterprise . " But native tendencies are stronger than arti * VoL I. , p. 83. j Ibid. , p. 89 . Ibid. , p. 92. // ficial stimulants as well as hindrances , and the younger doctor in due time relapsed into that disregard of fine writing and that supreme interest in the substance rather than the form or apparel of thought , which belonged to him in middle and later life . Immediately after graduating Mr. Wayland begam* the study of medicine , which he prosecuted , for the most part , in the office of Dr. Eli Burritt , of Troy . Although this study did not bear directly on the career upon which he afterwards entered , it was far from being unprofitable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association with a strong and disciplined mind , such as Dr. Burritt is said to have possessed , could not fail to exert a wholesome influence . In this period there occurred what Dr. Wayland 's biographers term his " intellectual regeneration . " He describes himself as having , up to that time , read with avidity novels , books of travel , descriptive poems , and the like , but to have turned away with disrelish from everything of a didactic or abstract nature . The papers in the Spectator of this character he passed over . On a sudden he found that his taste was changed , and an appetite awakened for a kind of reading which he had before regarded with aversion . This mental progress is not remarkable ; it is only worthy of note that , in his case , it was an epoch so distinctly marked . " I remember , " he says , " with perfect distinctness , the time when I first bccame conscious of a decided change in my whole intellectual character . I was sitting by a window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of study , or reading-place , and by accident I opened a volume of the Spectator-I think it was one of the essays forming Addison 's critique on Milton-it was at any rate something purely didfictic . I commenced reading it , and , to my delight and surprise , I found that I understood and really enjoyed it . " * After that he read with eagerness what he had formerly shunned . It was a revolution of taste suddenly discovered to himself . He draws the natural inference that in the education of children there should be no attempt to elicit abstract thinking , until the time for it comes . They must first learn through the imagination and the senses . His own mind he supposes to // have been slow in developing , and to have arrived at this era of conceptiVe thought at a later time than is usual. * Just as he completed his medical studies , he underwent another change , which was destined to be vastly more influential upon his future course . With his serious turn of mind , and under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverential spirit , he could hardly fail to be impressed with the truths of religion . But most of the preaching that he heard was of a too frigidly doctrinal cast to come home to his heart ; he had marked out for himself a series of mental experiences , through which he was expecting to pass if he should ever be converted , and he conceived that he must wait for the mysterious , overpowering influence ot the Spirit to illuminate and comfort his soul . Various causes , among which the preaching of a returned missionary , Rev. Luther Rice , was prominent , delivered him from his mistaken impressions , moved him to stirrender himself to the s*.rvice of God , and inspired him with the hopes of the Gospel . " The precise time , " he writes , " when a moral change took place in my character I can not determine . I have had many seasons of religious declension and revival ; I have been harassed with many doubts of my state before God , and have rarely attained to that full assurance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples of Christ . " t After he had resolved to study theology , it was a fortunate conjunction of circuh*istances that brought him to Andover , and gave him a year under that most kindling of theological professors , Moses Stuart . At this time young Wayland was poor in this world 's goods . He writes to his parents : - " Your letter containing fourteen dollars was received in due time . Permit me to thank you and the other givers for it . It arrived very opportunely . It has cleared me from debt , and bright . ened my prospects for a short time . I have some work in the library , which will probably bring inc in about ten dollars ; this , as I shall board myself , will keep me during vacation . " 4 Once he was much in want of a coat , but having only ten dollars he chose to do without it for the sake of a copy of Schiensncr 's Lexicon , which he procured for that sum . The recollec * Vol . I. , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I. , p. 76. // tion of his own conflict with poverty gave him afterwards a warm sympathy with his pupils when they Were in like circumstances , and he knew how to aid them with a liberal hand . Dr. Wayland 's delight in the exegetical study of the New Testament , and a certain jealousy of systematic divinity , were to some extent imbibed from Stuart . He experienced to the full the quickening power of this learned , vivacious , eloquent , but most inaccurate scholar , whose characteristic faults as well as merits he well understood . The tutorship in Union College was an episode in his life , and was followed by his ordination as pastor of the First Baptist Church in Boston . The society were not ' unanimous in their call , but Stuart advised him to comply with it , saying that nothing was needed to pacify discontent " but a little personal , kind attention , " and a little preaching without notes , to let them know that he could be inspired as well as his brethren. * His parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a prosperous one , and his qualities as a preacher were not of a sort to allure the multitude . " His manner in the pulpit was unattractive ; he was tall , lean , angular , ungraceful , spoke with but little action , rarely withdrawing his hands from his pockets save to turn a leaf , his eye seldom meeting the sympathetic eye of the auditor.t To those who conversed with him he appeared abstracted and embarrassed . The work of composition was laborious , and , with his habit of study , consumed so much time as to leave him little leisure to win , by personal intercourse , the affections of his people . " But all discerning hearers knew at once that he was no common man . His week-day lectures were more free and spirited iii the manner of delivery . He grew in power and in influence . Yet he was far from being satisfied with himself , and was more sensible than his hearers wee of the faults of his pulpit performances . He would pour into the ear of his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontent of his heart at the character of his sermons , and at the unprosperous condition of his congregation . The morning after he preached his famous missionary sermon he told Wisner it was a failure . But the reception that was accorded to * VoL L , p. 119 . Vol . I. , p. 121. // the discourse soon relieved him of this apprehension . The ability and eloquence that were displayed in it excited general applause . Read at this distance of time , this sermon on the moral dignity of the missionary enterprise , must be acknowledged to take rank with the most striking productions of the American pulpit . It showed that the author had a greatness of soul proportioned to the breadth and vigor of his understanding . The familiar passage on the progress of the Church . in the first three centuries will bear to be quoted again " The Church has commenced her march . Samaria Jias with one accord believed the Gospel . Antioch has become obedient to the faith . The name of Christ has been proclaimed throughout Asia Minor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invisible hand , are deserted . The citizens of Ephesus cry out in despair , Great is Diana of the Ephesians ! ' Licentious Corinth is purified by the preaching of Christ crucified . Persecution puts forth her arm to arrest the spreading superstition . ' But the progress of the faith can not be stayed . The Church of God advances unhurt , amidst racks and dungeons , persecutions and death ; yea , smiles at the drawn dagger , and defies its point . ' She has entered Italy , and appears before the walls of the Eternal City . Idolatr ? falls prostrate at her approach . Her ensign floats in triumph over the Capitol . She has placed upon her brow the diadem of the Ca*sars I " Dr. Wayland 's reflections on the character of his ministry form a very interesting passage of the Memoir . A more candid , discriminating piece of self-criticism it would be hard to find . He considers it a capital error that instead of accustoming himself to sp*ak without notes , he became " a reader of sermons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he supposes , awkward in the pulpit , and with not much practice as a speaker , he was easily persuaded to tie himself to the manuscript . " Had I , " he says , " at this time boldly thrown myself on my own resources , with reliance on the promised aid of the Spirit of God , I might have been more useful. *** " I never set myself resolutely to become a preacher , that is , one who , out of a full heart , and without reading , delivers his message to the people . " " If I had gained a proper victory over myselt over my love for reputation , and desire to be useful to my denomination by raising their intellectual character  --  and if I had , in reliance upon the Holy Spirit , // labored simply for the conversion of souls-I firmly believe that I should have been more useful , and I should now look upon the past with far greater satisfaction . " " I see that I had a sort of idea that I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own inherent energy , it would produce a moral effect . Hence my work of preparation was an intellectual rather than a moral and spiritual effort . I relied in a certain way , it is true , on the Spirit , and looked to Him for His assistance , but far too inadequately . " lie erred , also , as he supposes , in not visiting his people more , and in not making his visits more distinctly and faithfully religious . All this , to be sure , is the self-criticism of one who tries himself by the purest standards , and is more careful to avoid undue selfpraise than undeserved self-reproach . Yet it rests , doubtless , on a foundation of truth , and deserves to be pondered by all who have taken on themselves the sacred office . There is no portion of these volumes which we should sooner select in proof of Dr. Wayland 's perspicacity , fairness , and humility , than this honest and masterly review of his own characteristics as a parish minister . On the whole , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a service of five years , and accept a professorship in Union College ,  --  the professorship of Natural Philosophy , with the prospect of exchanging it soon for that of Moral Philosophy . This anticipation was happily frustrated by his speedy election to the presidency of Brown University , which had become vacant through the retirement of Dr. Messer . A young man of thirty-two , not a graduate of Brown , it was certainly a remarkable proof of the esteem in which he was held that he was invited to this important station . Under his untiring , vigilant , and vigorous administration of its affairs , the College quickly began to recover from the depression and disorder into which it had fallen in the last years of Messer . A stricter discipline was introduced , unproved methods of teaching raised the standard of scholarship among the students , the friends of the institution greatly increased its pecuniary resources , and younger professors , who had been trained under the President 's system , took the place of the old and lent their industrious support to his plans // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and usefulness without . The publication of valuable text-books , in departments where new text-books were especially needed , gave the President distinction throughout the country , and thus added to his power of doing good to his immediate pupils . We must refer the reader to the pages of the Memoir for information respecting the details of President Wayland 's long term of service , and for a full description of the principles which guided him in the work of government and instruction . As an academical teacher he has certainly had few equals . Although he exacted hard study of his pupils , and put their faithfulness in this point to a daily test , the members of the successive classes which *ssed through the Senior year at Brown , with few exceptions , found their hour of recitation with the President the most Weliglitful , as well as the most profitable , of the day . There are three modes of college teaching . According to the first , the officer simply hears the recitation , questioning the student upon the portion of the text-book which has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exercise merely puts to the proof the pupil 's diiigen*e and his power to master the prescribed task . Properly speaking , this is not to teach , since nothing is communicated by the instructor . He discharges a quct8i police function , which requires , however , a fair degree of knowledge and attentiveness . Somewhat more is done when the professor elucidates the text-book and connects with it sup plementar*y in* .. struction . This is teaching in the proper sense . But a far nobler work is done when the teacher is possessed of the ability and tact to put himself in communication with the scholar , so that the latter is no longer merely a recipie n't of that which is imparted , bat is rather prompted to think for himself , and to meet the teacher half-way by questions and suggestions of his own . His own mental activity is elicited , and the recitation frequently resolves itself into a conference , where in the friction of mind with mind , in the resolution of problems and difficulties , the intellect even of the sluggish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Socrates , the chief of them , considered it essential to adopt methods which were directly fitted to spur the minds of their pupils to the origina // tion and the accurate statement of thought . In their judgment , if this was not accomplished , nothing was done . The Great Teacher , by question , and parable , and paradox , compelled his disciples to abandon the position of passive recipients for one in which they must revolve and independently appropriate the lofty truth which he came to impart . Dr. Wayland believed in the ancient idea of teaching . Under him , in all the recitations at Brown University , the pupil had full liberty to interrogate the professor , to bring forward objections to the doctrine advanced from the chair , and , if he chose , to vindicate an opposite thesis by such arguments as he was able to produce . Of course care was taken not to consume time to no profit , and to leave room for the recitation pioper , whereby the amount of work which had been done by the pupil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried to perfection in the recitation-room of the President . The subjects on which he taught were best adapted to it , the students were in their last year and had begun to take on a more sober and manly tone , and the qualities of the instructor were such as to render his peculiar method most effective . His unruffled temper , his patience in listening , his quaint humor joined to a profound seriousness that made the class feel that they were engaged in earnest business , his noble elevation above all trammels of party and sect , the unaffected homage that he paid to truth , the pithy and often homely style of his observations , conspired to render him one of the most attractive of teachers . He called no man " Master , " and he , himself , laid claim to no dominion over the minds of others . No teacher was ever more free from the spirit of dogmatism . It was evident that though his convictions were strong , his mind was open to new light , come from whatever quarter it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could mingle in those conferences without feeling their influence Qn his intellectual and moral nature , through all the subsequent years of his life . For the good government of a College , the right adjustment of the powers of the faculty , with reference both to the President and to the board of trustees or overseers , is a matter . of prime consequence . Important acts of discipline , and all im // portant measures connected with the immediate management of the institution , should , in our judgment , emanate from the faculty as a body . Such acts and measures should be the subject of common conference , and be determined by vote . The President may be entrusted with the veto power in regard to the action of the faculty meetings ; but it is far better for him and for all concerned , that he should share his judicial and executive functions with his colleagues in the work of instruction . Under this system not only does every important measure proceed from the united wisdom of the governing body , but every member , inasmuch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is free from the temptation to murmur at the result . Harmony among the officers is much more likely to be maintained . The President is far less likely to be obliged to encounter the concealed or open disaffection of his fellow-instructors . Discipline becomes impersonal , so that no special odium falls on the President more than on any one of his associates . In this last particular the system of divided responsibility has a great advantage over that in which the administration is concentrat*d in the hands of one man . Nor need there be any delay or uncertainty in matters of discipline . All ordinary cases of delinquency should dispose of themselves , it being only necessary to apply to them the rules , written or unwritten , which have been previously established . But in affixing puifishments , as well as in determining the question of guilt or ' innocence , the knowledge which members of the faculty may have of the individual concerned is of essential service . Justice is much more likely to be done , and to be tempered with mercy , than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point is the relation of the faculty to the trustees or overseers . The latter , if they understand their office , will not wish to be overseers in the Southern sense of the word . They should avoid everything that looks like intermeddling with the special work of the Professors . The general supervision which belongs to the trustees should qualify them to discover abuses before they have taken root , and to provide the proper remedy . They are charged with the duty of seeing that the endowments of the institution are not misapplied. // No important change can take place in the course of study , or in the system generally , without their express approbation . The faculty initiate no new measure without the consciousness that it must pass under the eye and receive the sanction of the governing board . This consciousness operates constantly as a check upon hasty or irregular proceedings . A competent board of trustees will occasionaly suggest and introduce improvements ; but a thirst for innovation , a restless disposition to do something without knowing exactly what , are among the worst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faculty must be allowed to feel that they are trusted , and that they are not liable to be hindered in the prosecution of their plans by unseemly interference . It must be taken for granted that they understand their business , as well at least as other people whose callings are different . An uneasy , ambitious , conceited , meddlesome , dictatorial trustee , is a positive nuisance in a college . If an instructor is for any cause incompetent , let him be removed ; but so long as he remains in his station , he must not be cramped in his work . Dr. Arnold of Rugby refused to carry out suggestions of his trustees in regard to methods of instruction . Their remedy , he said , was to remove him , but as long as he remained in his place he must follow , on these points , his own judgment . One rule , of course , is not applicable to all institutions ; but , generally speaking , the *aculty , on grounds of policy as well as of right , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . In most cases there are no better judges of the fitness of candidates ; and the intimate association in which it is desirable for the Professors to stand with one another , and the necessity that all should work together with one spirit , are obvious reasons in favor of conceding to them this privilege . We have the impression that at Brown University , in the days of President Wayland , at least , the system was defective in both the respects we have named . Too much power belonged to the President as related to the faculty , and too little power to the faculty as related to the governing boards , however judiciously the lattter may have managed . If we err in this regard , the foregoing remarks will still be not without value . We are disposed to believe , however , that the President would have found his position more comfortable to // himself ; and not less useful to the College , if the system had been conformed to the ideas we have suggested . Occasional complaints of arbitrary government would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , in this place , into an examination of Dr. Wayland 's writings . We will only refer briefly to the little treatise on the Limitations of Human Responsibility , which appears to us to be one of the most characteristic and , on the whole , one of the most meritorious of his productions . The idea of the book is implied in the motto ,  --  non omnes possumus omnia . Religious persecution , voluntary associations , ecclesiastical associations , , are among the topics handled . Everywhere the rights and the responsibility of the individual are strenuously maintained . It is true that misgivings are expressed as to the moral right of Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia without the consent of Maryland and Virginia , the States by which the district was ceded ,  --  misgivings which the author shared , if we mistake not , with so determined an enemy of slavery as John Quincy Adams . On this particular point it is probable that Dr. Wayland changed his opinion , although he never entertained any sentiment concerning slavery itself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book , as we have implied , is in favor of the rights of free oJj*inion and independent action on the part of the individual , as opposed to a meddlesome and intolerant spirit , and to the exaggerated influence and dictatorial tendency of reform associations . The following short extract , from the chapter on the propagation of truth , will convey a correct idea of the general drift of the treatise " Truth , in the sense in which it is explained above , is a valuable treasure , frequently the most valuable treasure of which we can be possessed . On what do our hopes for eternity rest , our hopes of pardon , and salvation , and everlasting life , but on the truths of the Gospel , which have been communicated to us by others ' ? But , valuable as even this treasure is , we have no right to force it upon another . I have no more right to fill my neighbor 's pocket with diamonds , than with gravel stones , unless he consent . I may offer him diamonds , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go away without them . I can not help it . If I offer him abundance , and he prefer poverty , I am not responsible . He must , after all , do as he pleases . " Such is the case in the present instance . I desire to communicate to my // neighbor valuable truth . He has the right to hear it or not , and I may not , on any pretence , violate his right . He has the same right to the use of his ears , that I have to the use of my tongue . I may , if I please , plead with him , and entreat him to hear me . I may present to him all the motives with which I am acquainted , to induce him to attend to my instructions ; but this is all . If he still persist , nay , if he will neither hear my truth , nor listen to the motives by which I urge him to do so , his decision is ultimate ; I can do no more . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is obvious . Every man be .. lieves his own opinions to te true , and what could be a greater absurdity , than to allow every man to inflict upon his neighbor whatever conversation he pleased ; nay , to oblige him by force to listen to it , simply because he supposed it to be true and important ? " The thoughts of this unpretending treatise are far from being obsolete . They may well be commended to the thoughtful attention of that uninerous class of reformers , who presume to denounce everybody who ventures to think that a good end may be best reachcd by other measures than those which they prefer . It is well known that Dr. Wayland , towards the end of his presidency , introduced into Brown University an essential modification of the college system . He believed that the opportunity of higher education should be opened to a much wider class than those destined for the learned prok*ssions ; that courses of study should be established for the benefit of persons looking forward to occupations which involve an application of* science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and that in these courses Latin and Greek should retire to make room for other branches . He desired to render the facilities possessed by the college for imparting knowledge available to the practical farmer and the artisan , as well as to those who had heretofore profited by them . Many of the ideas at the foundation of the new system indicate the enterprise , foresight , and large benevolence of the author of it ; and they are realized in the various schools of science which are springing up in different parts of the country . There was a call for that species of higher t.raining which President Wayland was desirous of organizing , and which he so earnestly advocated in his Report to the Corporation of Brown University . So far as his plan aimed at this result , none will doubt that it is deserving of praise . It is our settled conviction , however , that a liberal education is to be distinguished // from all forms of special or technical education , whatever value may belong to these in their place . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to fancy or choice to determine . The constitution of things , and the course of history , as well as the structure of the human mind , define what these shall be . The study of the classical languages and literature is a leading , essential , indispensable part of such a scheme of education . The clamor which we are now hearing about " heathen learning " and " dead languages " is the outcry , to a great extent , of ignorance and superficiality . The proper study of mankind is man ; and man is to be known through the study of history and literature . The foundation in this study , as well as the necessary key to large attainments in it , lies in the knowledge of the Latin and Greek . The disciplinary and humanizing influence of classical studies is something of inestimable value , and what nothing else can provide . The modern languages and the physical sciences will not do the work that is done by Latin and Greek , and that appears even when the ancient tongues are defectively taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately amused an Edinburgh audience by a lively piece of declamation against the accepted system of university training . There are faults in that system , and there are faults in that mode of teaching Latin and Greek which is prevalent in England ; and we are quite willing to see both these classes of faults exposed . But Mr. Lowe could never have made a speech having the rhetorical merits that belong to his late address , had he been educated on the method which he recommends ; and whatever brilliancy pertains to his harangue he owes chiefly to the drill he has had in the branches which he decries . As for his argument , it is a tissue of sparkling fallacies . A much more sound and discriminating view of the whole subject is preseiited in a lately published address of Mr. J. S. Mill . Entertaining these opinions , we hold , as a natural corollary , that the course of liberal education , par excellence , should be recognized and held in honor as such , and , in the arrangements of university education , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way to convey the impression that it stands on the same footing // with them , and that all are only different paths to one goal . So far as the new system at Brown University was liable to this objection , and so far as in the advocacy of it there was a disparagement of the value of classical studies and of education substantially on the model of the old curriculum , we must say-as of new wine compared with old- " the old is better . " The opinions which President Wayland published , in the latter part of his life , on the subject of theological education , were the theme of much comment , and met with no little opposition . I* is singular that in the early part of his career he was considered the advocate as well as the representative of a higher type of culture than prevailed at that time in his own denomination , and his settlement in Boston was favored by Stuart and others of his Congregationalist friends , as a means of promoting the interests of literature and education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to deplore a departure on the part of his Baptist friends from the oldfashioned dependence on the " gifts of the spirit " and an " unlearned ministry . " To do justice to Dr. Wayland , it is necessary to give attention to the great idea which he was attempting , in his later utterances , to enforce . This is , that every disciple should be a discipler ; " every believer in Christ should be an active propagator of the Gospel , by personal efforts to convert men to the same faith . lie must persuade all within the reach of his influence to repent of their sins and enter on the Christian life . The special character and extent of his efforts in this direction must depend on his talents , his knowledge , and his opportunities . If his circumstances do not permit him to become a scholar , or to attend much to scientific theology , he may still be qualified for use fulness as a preacher , and he is not to be discouraged from choosing the ministry as a vocation On account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country vastly outruns the ability of the Theological Seminaries to supply it . The harvest is great , and the thin ranks of the laborers must be recruited from the counting-houses and work-shops , and wherever respectable talents and a fair amount of knowledge coexist with an absorbing consecration of the heart to Christ . These considerations must be admitted to be sound . There // was need , moreover , that they should be urged on the public attention . At the same time , the necessity and the benefits of a learned and regularly trained body of ministers are so patent , that an argument on this side , at this late day , would seem to be gratuitous . To interpret the Bible , an ancient book , written in distant lands and in unfamiliar tongues ; to vindicate Christianity against skeptical objections , and to resolve the perplexities of honest minds respecting its contents ; to discern and set forth the harmony of the Christian system of doctrine ; to bring out and illustrate the truths of the Gospel , week after week , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these truths in their manifold bearings on human life and duty , commending them to every man 's conscience ,  --  all this constitutes a work for which a fewyears of special preparation and forethought are surely not too long . The old plea that study fosters a dry and frigid intellectualism may be answered by the fact that the most fervid and effective of preachers , Luther , Whitefield , Wesley , Edwards , and more whom it were easy to name , have been trained scholars . And the additional fact must never be forgotten , that there is not less danger from the enthusiasm that is begotten of ignorance , than from the undue influence of the intellectual element among the clergy . A zeal , not according to knowledge , givin birth to wild opinions and disorganizing , wasting excite**ents , is not less to be dreaded , if history be our witness , than the intrusion of human philosophy within the province of sacred truth . It is too late to contend that study and knowledge properly tend to chill piety , and that ignorance is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a discipIer , and if the comparatively uneducated are to be invited into the ministry , it is all the more indispenm*able that manyas many as possible-should receive a thorough training for this exalted office , in order that from them light and guidance may be diffused among less favored associates , and thus the obviotis perils arising from the existence of an unlearned ministry be avoided . There are numerons instances , it must be added , of individuals who , from a neglect to prepare themselves by prolonged study for the clerical office , have brought to their work inferior resources , and labored under a great dis // advantage through the whole remainder of their lives . To call men to repentance , and so produce conversions , is far from being the sole work of a Gospel minister in a community like ours . He has to quicken , instruct , edify the people under his charge . Preaching should be direct , and should be addressed to the conscience ; but the prime duty of repentance must be presented in varied a*pects , and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than reiterate the ordinary statements on this subject , and follow them with an exhortation , may produce an impression for a little while , but his discoursing will soon become as ineffective as it is wearisome . His little round of topics is soon exhausted , and being destitute of the resources which reading and reflection are adapted to give , his harangues become " stale , flat , and unprofitable . " It is probable that IDr . Wayland would have assented to what has been said in the foregoing paragraph . He was himself too much indebted to his Seminary training under Stuart , to undervalue such an advantage . The year that he spent at Andover enhanced his usefulness and enlarged his power in a degree which it would be difficult to estimate . Had his course of theological study been twice or thrice as long , he would never have found cause to regret it . But he somehow made the impression of being unfriendly to theological study , and theological instructors in his own denomination complained that his influence was cast in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency in favor of admitting and inviting to the ministry a larger class for whom an extended course of study is not practicable . It was natural that he should seem , in the warmth of his advocacy of his favorite idea , to disparage a regular theological training . His language occasionally was such as might naturally leave this impression . Thus , in a letter to Dr. Anderson , he says : - " In this country Congregationalism and Presbyterianism advocated a learned ministry . They did not increase ex3ept by hereditary succession . The Baptists began on the other principle , and overrun the country in spite of all opposition . The Methodists followed , and did the same thing . They both now are aiming at a learned ministry , and they are standing still , // except in new parts of the country where these ideas do not prevail . ' ** In reading these sentences , one is tempted to ask whether Dr. Wayland disapproves of the earnest desire of the fathers of New England to have an educated and learned ministry ? Whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this end ? Whether their success in their self-sacrificing endeavor has brought good or evil to the church and the nation ? That he adds the remark that he has " of course no objection to education in the ministry , " does not remove the impression which his previous words are naturally fitted to make . Our inference from the experience of the several denominations to which he adverts , would be that while an educated ministry is indispensable , there is room in the pulpit for the exercise of diverse gifts , and that the church does well in employing all the zeal and earnestness within its bounds in the work of proclaiming the Gospel . While , therefore , we believe that Dr. Wayland was right in his m*tin principle that " every disciple must be a discipler , " and in the proposition that all ministers need not be liberally educated or receive a systematic training in theology ; while we think , also , that his efforts to impress this idea on the churches were timely and useful , we are still of opinion that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Wayland com*ained of the prevalent style of preaching , that it is too discursive , that it lacks directness and simplicity , and that the severe , uncompromising demand of the Gospel upon every soul is either left in the background or veneered with smooth verbiage . He complained that fine orations are often substituted for Gospel sermons ; that the philosophy of Christianity is discussed , while the direct inculcation of Christianity itself , in its personal bearing on the hearers immediately addressed , is neglected . He thought that he discerned a tendency to dress up the truths of the Gospel in a garb to suit the lovers of this world . A spirit of accommodation , he believed , was operating to dull the edge of that doctrine which is adapted , when taught in its naked simplicity , to pierce the conscience , humble the soul in penitence , and bring guilty // Jan. , men to the cross of Christ . He was , also , impressed with the conviction that , of late , pastoral labor has been either given up to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and turned into an intercourse of mere friendship . In 1857 , in consequence of a request to fill temporarily the place of a pastor in the First Baptist Church in Providence , an opportunity was given him to put his theories in practice . The record of his labors for eighteen months in that parish presents a remarkable example of Christian zeal and fidelity . He did not confine his labors to the pulpit , but went from house to house , conversing with every family on the subject of personal religion , and following the men who could not be met at home to their places of business . The very sight of the man as he moved about the city , engaged , as was well known , in urging the claims of the Gospel upon the attention of the people , was itself an impressive sermon . The weight of his character , not less than the momentous nature of the message he bore , secured for him everywhere a respectful hearing . Besides these exertions , Dr. Wayland 's closing years were largely devoted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Providence , and effecting an important reform in that establishment . In every humane enterprise , his aid was sought and efficiently bestowed . We shall attempt no studied estimate of the qualities and services of President Wayland . The readers of the Memoir will naturally vary somewhat in their judgments concerning him , according as they sympathize , or fail to sympathize , with the guiding principles and spirit of his life , it is obvious that in him there were blended , with an *understanding of uncoinmon strength , profound moral and religious sentiments ; and that these elements were so mixed as to impart a singular dignity and elevation to his character . He stood intellectually midway between a speculative , metaphysical , and an empirical cast of mind ; dwelling in a region of principles , yet of principles in close contact with practical life . A muscular , manly quality belonged to his thinking , as to his character . He was fitted by nature to be a leader and commander . Wherever he might be , he would be acknowledged as a man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University , // and in the hearts of its graduates , now and hereafter , the same rank that is accorded at Yale to President Dwight . The literary execution of the Memoir is quite satisfactory . Tho sons of Dr. Wayland have wisely preferred to let him speak for himself , as far as was practicable , and have added to his own letters and reminiscences the recollections and testimoflies of his pupils . None of the " pupils , parishioners , and friends " of Dr. Way land , to whom the biography is inscribed , will find it either too long or deficient in interest . Inthe case of such a man , it is right to construct the memoir with special reference to the numerous class who will make up the major part of its readers , and others who stand at a greater distance have the liberty of omitting what they do not desire to read . It will be no matter of surprise if persons who see little to honor in the religious earnestness of Dr. Wayland , should wish that his biography had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be no argument either against the Memoir or the subject of it , should they fail to satisfy the taste of a literary pagan . These volumes form a becoming tribute of filial piety towards one who deserves to be honorably remembered , not only within the circle of his own family , but also where . ever exalted worth , both intellectual and moral , is a title to respect . Probably there are special aspects of Dr. Wayland 's noble career which each of the authors of this biography may have been better qu*lified to depict than the other ; but their combined exertions have produced a full and faithful portraiture of his public work . As to his private life , the tenderness and charm that belonged to him in the domestic circle , and the instructive flow of his familiar conversation , they had only to draw on their own grateful recollections . We feel sure that from academical teachers , from ministers and candidates for the ministry , and from intelligent laymen who are attracted by an illustrious example of Christian excellence , and in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dedicated , it will receive a thankful welcome . The former students of Brown University will take pleasure in brightening their memory of a venerated instructor , and of the able band of professors whom he called around him , and who lent him their devoted and wise co6peration.
