ART . VIII . - The Rebellion Record . Edited by FRANK MOORE . New York : G. P. Putnam. 1860 - 64 . Six volumes . 8vo . IT has been said that the American people are less apt than others to profit by experience , because the bustle of their lives keeps breaking the thread of that attention which is the material of memory , till no one has patience or leisure to spin from it a continuous thread of thought . We suspect that this is not more true of us than of other nations , - than it is of all people who read newspapers . Great events are perhaps not more common than they used to be , but a vastly greater number of trivial incidents are now recorded , and this dust of time gets in our eyes . The telegraph strips history of everything down to the bare fact , but it does not observe the true proportions of things , and we must make an effort to recover them . In brevity and cynicism it is a mechanical Tacitus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sherman , as impartial a leveller as death . It announces with equal sangfroid the surrender of Kirby Smith and the capture of a fresh Rebel Governor , reducing us to the stature at which posterity shall reckon us . Eminent contemporaneousness may see here how much space will be allotted to it in the historical compends and biographical dictionaries of the next generation . In artless irony the telegraph is unequalled among the satirists of this generation . But this short-hand diarist confounds all distinctions of great and little , and roils the memory with minute particles of what is oddly enough called intelligence . We read in successive paragraphs the appointment of a Provisional Governor of North Carolina , whose fitness or want of it may be the turning-point of our future history , and the nomination of a minister , who will at most only bewilder some foreign court with a more desperately helpless French than his predecessor . The conspiracy trial at Washington , whose result will have absolutely no effect on the real affairs of the nation , occupies for the moment more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which involves the life or death of the very principle we have been fighting for these four years . Undoubtedly the event of the day , whatever it may be , is apt // to become unduly prominent , and to thrust itself obscuringly between us and the perhaps more important event of yesterday , where the public appetite demands fresh gossip rather than real news , and the press accordingly keeps its spies everywhere on the lookout for trifles that become important by being later than the last . And yet this minuteness of triviality has its value also . Our sensitive sheet gives us every morning the photograph of yesterday , and enables us to detect and to study at leisure that fleeting expression of the time which betrays its character , and which might altogether escape us in the idealized historical portrait . We can not estimate the value of the items in our daily newspaper , because the world to which they relate is too familiar and prosaic ; but a hundred years hence some Thackeray will find them full of picturesque life and spirit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last century more vividly real to us than any history . The jests which Pompeian idlers scribbled on the walls , while Vesuvius was brooding its fiery conspiracy under their feet , bring the scene nearer home to us than the letter of Pliny , and deepen the tragedy by their trifling contrast , like the gravediggers ' unseemly gabble in Hamlet . Perhaps our judgment of history is made sounder , and our view of it more lifelike , when we are so constantly reminded how the little things of life assert their place alongside the great ones , and how healthy the constitution of the race is , how sound its digestion , how gay its humor , that can take the world so easily while our continent is racked with fever and struggling for life agaii*st the doctors . " Let Hercules himself do what he may , The cat will mew , the dog must have his day . " It is always pleasant to meet Dame Clio over the tea-table , as it were , where she is often more entertaining , if not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port and more ceremonious habit of a Muse . These inadvertences of history are pleasing . We are no longer foreigners in any age of the world , but feel that in a few days we could have accommodated ourselves there , and that , wherever men are , we are not far from home . The more we can individualize and personify , the more lively our sympathy . Man interests us scientifically , but men claim us through all that we have made a part of our // nature by education and custom . We would give more to know what Xenophou 's soldiers gossiped about round their camp-fires , than for all the particulars of their retreat . Sparta becomes human to us when we think of Agesilaus on his hobby-horse . Finding that those heroic figures romped with their children , we begin for the first time to suspect that they ever really existed as much as Robinson Crusoe . Without these personal traits , antiquity seems as unreal to us as Sir Thomas More 's Utopia . It is , indeed , surprising how little of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , voluminous as it is . Where does chivalry at last become something more than a mere procession of plumes and armor , to be lamented by Burke , except in some of the less ambitious verses of the Trouv*res , where we hear the canakin clink too emphatically , perhaps , but which at least paint living men and possible manners ? Tennyson 's knights are cloudy , gigantic , of no age or country , like the heroes of Ossian . They are creatures without stomachs . Homer is more condescending , and though we might not be able to draw the bow of Ulysses , we feel quite at home with him and Euineeus over their roast pork . We can not deny that the poetical view of any period is higher , and in the deepest sense truer , than all others ; but we are thankful also for the penny-a-liner , whether ancient or modern , who reflects the whims and humors , the enthusiasms and weaknesses , of the public in unguarded moments . Is it so certain , after all , that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matters if these were denied us ? In one respect , and no unimportant one , the instantaneous dispersion of news and the universal interest in it have affected the national thought and character . The whole people have acquired a certain metropolitan temper ; they feel everything at once and in common ; a single pulse sends anger , grief , or triumph through the whole country ; one man sitting at the keyboard of the telegraph in Washington sets the chords vibrating to the same tune from sea to sea ; and this simultaneousness , this unanimity , deepens national consciousness and intensifies popular emotion . Every man feels himself a part , sensitive and sympathetic , of this vast organism , a partner in // its life or death . The sentiment of patriotism is etherealized and ennobled by it , is kindled by the more or less conscious presence of an ideal element ; and the instinctive love of a few familiar hills and fields widens , till Country is no longer an abstraction , but a living presence , felt in the heart and operative in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is no trifling matter that thirty millions of men should be thinking the same thought and feeling the same pang at a single moment of time , and that these vast parallels of latitude should become a neighborhood more intimate than many a country village . The dream of Human Brotherhood seems to be coming true at last . The peasant who dipped his net in the Danube , or trapped the beaver on its banks , perhaps never heard of Ca*sar or of Ca3sar 's murder ; but the shot that shattered the forecasting brain , and curdled the warm , sweet heart of the most American of Americans , echoed along the wires through the length and breadth of a continent , swelling all eyes at once with tears of indignant sorrow . Here was a tragedy fulfilling the demands of Aristotle , and purifying with an instantaneous throb of pity and terror a theatre of such proportions as the world never saw . We doubt if history ever recorded an event as touching and awful as this sympathy so wholly emancipated from the toils of space and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentient , as some have dreamed , or the great god Pan alive again to make the hearts of nations stand still with his shout . What is Beethoven 's " Funeral March for the Death of a Hero , " to the symphony of love , pity , and wrathful resolve which the telegraph of that April morning played on the pulses of a nation ? It has been said that our system of town-meetings made our Revolution possible , by edncating the people in self-government . But this was at most of partial efficacy , while the newspaper and telegraph gather the whole nation into a vast town-meeting , where every one hears the affairs of the country discussed , and where the better judgment is pretty sure to make itself valid at last . No memorable thing is said or done , no invention or discovery is made , that some mention of it does not sooner or later reach the ears of a majority of Americans . It is this constant mental and moral stimulus which gives them YOL. cI. - NO. 208. 1.3 // the alertness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in great cities , and which has been remarked on by English tourists as if it were a kind of physiological transformation . They seem to think we have lost something of that solidity of character which ( with all other good qualities ) they consider the peculiar inheritance of the British race , though inherited in an elder brother 's proportion by the favored dwellers in the British Isles . We doubt if any substantial excellence is lost by this suppling of the intellectual faculties , and bringing the nervous system nearer the surface by the absorption of superfluous fat . What is lost in bulk may be gained in spring . It is true that the clown , with his parochial horizon , his diet inconveniently thin , and his head conveniently thick , whose notion of greatness is a prize pig , and whose patriotism rises or falls with the strength of his beer , is a creature as little likely to be met with here as the dodo , his only rival in the qualities that make up a good citizen ; but this is no result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an earlier period of civilization than ours . Nor is it so clear that solidity is always a virtue , and lightness a vice in character , any more than in bread , or that the leaven of our institutions works anything else than a wholesome ferment and aeration . The experience of the last four years is enough to prove that sensibility may consist with tenacity of purpose , and that enthusiasm may become a permanent motive where the conviction of the worth of its object is profound and logical . There are things in this universe deeper and higher , more solid even , than the English Constitution . If that is the perfection of human wisdom and a sufficing object of faith and worship for our cousins over the water , on the other hand God 's dealing with this chosen people is preparing them to conceive of a perfection of divine wisdom , a constitution in the framing of which man 's wit had no share , and which shall yet be supreme , as it is continually more or less plainly influential in the governnient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any we have yet had , but we have faith that the lesson will be learned at last . If the assertion which we alluded to at the outset were true , if we , more than others , are apt to forget the past in the present , the // work of Mr. Moore , the title of which we have put at the head of our article , would do much in helping us to recover what we have lost . Had its execution been as complete as its plan was excellent , it would have left nothing to be desired . Its want of order may be charged upon the necessity of monthly publication ; hut there are other defects which this will hardly excuse . The editor seems to have become gradually helpless before the mass of material that heaped itself about him , and to have shovelled from sheer despair of selection . In the documentary part lie is sufficiently , sometimes eveii depressingly full , and he has preserved a great deal of fugitive poetry from both sides , much of it spirited , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frequently neglected to give his authorities . His extracts from the newspapers of the day , especially from Southern and foreign ones , are provokingly few , and his department of " incidents and rumors , " the true mirror of the time , inadequate both in quantity and quality . In spite of these defects , however , there is enough to recall vividly the features of the time at any marked period during the war , to renew the phases of feeling , to trace the slowly gathering current of opinion , and to see a definite purpose gradually orbing itself out of the chaos of plans and motives , hopes , fears , enthusiasms , and despondencies . We do not propose to review the book , - we might , indeed , almost as well undertake to review the works of Father Time himself , - but , relying chiefly on its help in piecing out our materials , shall try to freshen the memory of certain facts and experiences worth bearing in mind either for example or warning . It is of importance , especially considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of the South are expected to play in reconstruction , to keep clearly before our mimwls the motives and the manner of the Rebellion . Perhaps we should say inducements rather than motives , for of these there was but a single one put forward by the seceding States , namely , the obtaining security , permanence , and extension for the system of slavery . We do not use the qualifying epithet African , because the franker propagandists of Southern principles af // firmed the divine institution of slavery pure and simple , without regard to color or the curse of Canaan . This being the single motive of the Rebellion , what was its real object ? Primarily , to possess itself of the government by a sudden coup d&gt;*tat ; or that failing , then , secondarily , by a peaceful secession , which should paralyze the commerce and manufactures of the Free States , to bring them to terms of submission . Whatever may have been the opinion of some of the more far-sighted , it is clear that a vast majority of the Southern people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be peaceful . Their inducements to moving precisely when they did were several . At home the treasury was empty ; faithless ministers had supplied the Southern arsenals with arms , and so disposed the army and navy as to render them useless for any sudden need ; but above all , they could reckon on several months of an administration which , if not friendly , was so feeble as to be more dangerous to the country than to its betrayers , and there was a great party at the North hitherto their subservient allies , and now sharing with them in the bitterness of a common political defeat. * Abroad there was peace , with the prospect of its continuance ; the two great maritime powers were also the great consumers of cotton , were both deadly enemies , like themselves , to the democratic principle , and , if not actively interfering , would at least throw all the moral weight of their sympathy and encouragement on the Southern side . They were not altogether mistaken in their reckoning . The imbecility of Mr. Buchanan bedded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where none of her guns could be brought to bear , and whence nothing but the tide of indignation which followed the attack on Sumter could have set her afloat again , while prominent men and journals of the Democratic party hastened to assure the Rebels , not only of approval , but of active physical assistance . England , with indecent eagerness , proclaimed a neutrality which secured belligerent rights to a conspiracy that was never to become a nation , and thus enabled members of Parliament to fit out privateers to prey with impunity on the commerce of a friendly power . The wily // Napoleon followed , after an interval long enough to throw all responsibility for the measure , and to direct all the natural irritation it excited in this country , upon his neighbor over the way . England is now endeavoring to evade the consequences of her hasty proclamation and her jaunty indifference to the enforcement of it upon her own subjects . The principle of international law involved is a most important one ; but it was not so much the act itself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animus that so plainly prompted it , which Amencans find it hard to forgive . It would be unwise in us to forget that independence was a merely secondary and incidental consideration with the Southern conspirators at the beginning of the Rebellion , however they may have thought it wise to put it in the front , both for the sake of their foreign abettors who were squeamish about seeming , though quite iiidifferent about being , false to their own professions and the higher interests of their country , and also for the sake of its traditionary influence among the Southern people . Some , it is true , were bold enough or logical enough to advocate barbarism as a good in itself ; and in estimating the influences which have rendered some minds , if not friendly to the Rebellion , at least indifferent to the success of the Union , we should not forget that reaction against the softening and humanizing effect of modern civilization , led by such men as Carlyle , and joined in by a multitude whose intellectual and moral fibre is too much unstrung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protestants against the religion which sacrifices to the polished idol of Decorum and translates Jehovah by Gomme-il-faut , they find even the divine manhood of Christ too tame for them , and transfer their allegiance to the shaggy Thor with his mallet of brute force . This is hardly to be wondered at when we hear England called prosperous for the strange reason that she no longer dares to act from a noble impulse , and when , at whatever page of her recent history one opens , he finds her statesmanship to consist of one Noble Lord or Honorable Member asking a question , and another Noble Lord or Honorable Member endeavoring to dodge it , amid cries of Hear ! Hear ! enthusiastic in proportion to the fruitlessness of listening . After all , we are inclined to // think there is more real prosperity , more that posterity will find to have a deep meaning and reality , in a democracy spending itself for a principle , and , in spite of the remonstrances , protests , and sneers of a world busy in the eternal seesaw of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and property are mere counters of no value except as representatives of a higher idea . May it be long ere government becomes in the New World , as in the Old , an armed police and fire-department to protect property as it grows more worthless by being selfishly clutched in fewer hands , and keep God 's fire of manhood from reaching that gunpowder of the dangerous classes which underlies all institutions based on the wisdom of our ancestors . As we look back to the beginnings of the Rebellion we are struck with the thoughtlessness with which both parties entered upon a war , of whose vast proportions and results neither was even dimly conscious . But a manifest difference is to be remarked . In the South this thoughtlessness was the result of an ignorant self-confidence , in the North of inexperience and good humor . It was long before either side could believe that the other was in earnest , the one in attacking a government which they knew only by their lion 's share in its offices and influence , the other in resisting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapable of subjugation , and unable to die comfortably except in the last ditch of jubilant oratory . When at last each was convinced of the other 's sincerity , the moods of both might have been predicted by any observer of human nature . The side which felt that it was not only in the wrong , but that it had made a blunder , lost all control of its temper , all regard for truth and honor . It betook itself forthwith to lies , bluster , and cowardly abuse of its antagonist . But beneath every other expression of Southern sentiment , and seeming to be the base of it , was a ferocity not to be accounted for by thwarted calculations or by any resentment at injuries received , but only by the influence of slavery on the character and manners . " Scratch a Russian , " said Napoleon , " and you come to the Tartar beneath . " Scratch a slaveholder , and beneath the varnish of conventionalism you come upon something akin to the man-hunter of Dahomey . Nay , the selfishness engendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest is more // irritable and resentful in the civilized than the savage man , as it is enhanced by a consciousness of guilt . In the first flush of over-confidence , when the Rebels reckoned on taking Washington , the air was to be darkened with the gibbeted carcasses of dogs and caitiffs . Pollard , in the first volume of his Southern History of the War , prints without comment the letter of a ruffian who helped butcher our wounded in Sudly Church after the first battle of Manassas , in which he says that he had resolved to give no quarter . In Missouri the Rebels took scalp 's as trophies , and that they made personal ornaments of the bones of our nuburied dead , and that women wore them , though seeming incredible , has been proved beyond question . Later in the war , they literally starved our prisoners in a country where Sherman 's army of a hundred thousand men found supplies so abundant that they could dispense with their provision train . Yet these were the " gentry " of the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better classes of England so keenly sympathized . Our experience is thrown away unless it teach us that every form of conventionalized injustice is instinctively in league with every other , the world over , and that all institutions safe only in law , but forever in danger from reason and conscience , beget first selfishness , next fear , and then cruelty , by an incurable degeneration . Having been thus taught that a rebellion against justice and mercy has certain natural confederates , we must be blind indeed not to see whose alliance at the South is to give meaning and permanence to our victory over it . In the North , on the other hand , nothing is more striking than the persistence in good nature , the tenacity with which the theories of the erring brother and the prodigal son were clung to , despite all evidence of facts to the contrary . There was a kind of boyishness in the rumors which the newspapers circulated ( not seldom with intent to dispirit ) , and the people believed on the authority of reliable gentlemen from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At one time the Rebels had mined eleven acres in the neighborhood of Bull Run ; at another , there were regiments of giants on their way from Texas , who , first paralyzing our batteries by a yell , would rush unscathed upon the guns and rip up the // unresisting artillerymen with bowie-knives three feet long , made for that precise service , and the only weapon to which these Berserkers would condescend ; again , for the fiftieth time , France and England had definitely agreed upon a forcible intervention ; finally , in order to sap the growing confidence of the people in President Lincoln , one of his family was accused of communicating our plans to the Rebels , and this at a time when the favorite charge against his administration was the having no plan at all . The public mind , as the public folly is generally called , was kept in a fidget by these marvels and others like them . But the point to which we would especially call attention is this , that , while the war slowly educated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old nonsense out of the South . Nothing is more striking , as we trace Northern opinion through those four years that seemed so long and seem so short , than to see how the minds of men were sobered , braced , and matured as the greatness of the principles at stake became more and more manifest , how their purpose , instead of relaxing , was strained tighter by disappointment , and by the growing sense of a guidance wiser than their own . Nor should we forget how slow the great body of the people were in being persuaded of the expediency of directly attacking slavery , and after that of enlisting colored troops ; of the fact , in short , that it must always be legal to preserve the source of the law 's authority , and constitutional to save the country . The prudence of those measures is now acknowledged by all , and justified by the result ; but we must not be blind to the deeper moral , that justice is always and only politic , that it needs no precedent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to be true to our nobler judgment . In one respect only the popular understanding seems always to have been , and still to remain , confused . Our notion of treason is a purely traditional one , derived from countries where the question at issue has not been the life of the nation , but the conflicting titles of this or that family to govern it . Many people appear to consider civil war as merely a more earnest kind of political contest , which leaves the relative position of the parties as they would be after a Presidential election . But no treason was ever so wicked as // that of Davis and his fellow-conspirators , for it had no apology of injury or even of disputed right , and it was aimed against the fairest hope and promise of the world . They did not attempt to put one king in place of another , but to dethrone human nature and discrown the very manhood of the race . And in what respects does a civil war differ from any other in the discretion which it leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security for the future ? A contest begun for such ends and maintained by such expedients as this has been , is not to be concluded by merely crying quits and shaking hands . The slave-holding States chose to make themselves a foreign people to us , and they must take the consequences . We surely can not be expected to take them back as if nothing had happened , as if victory rendered us helpless to promote good or prevent evil , and took from us all title to insist on the admission of the very principle for which we have sacrificed so much . The war has established the unity of the government , but no peace will be anything more than a pretence unless it rests upon the unity of the nation , and that can only be secured by making everywhere supreme the national idea that freedom is a right inherent in man himself , and not a creature of the law , to be granted to one class of men or withheld from it at the option of another . What bave we conquered ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present war ? Surely not these or any one of these merely . The fruit of our victory , as it was always the object of our warfare , is the everlasting validity of the theory of the Declaration of Independence in these United States , and the obligation before God and man to make it the rule of our practice . It was in that only that we were stronger than our enemies , stronger than the public opinion of the world ; and it is from that alone that we derive our right of the strongest , for it is wisdom , justice , and the manifest will of Him who made of one blood all the nations of the earth . It were a childish view of the matter to think this a mere trial of strength or struggle for supremacy between the North and South . The war sprang from the inherent antipathy between two forms of political organization radically hostile to each other . Is the war over , will it ever be over , if we allow the // incompatibility to remain , childishly satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grapple of two brothers that already struggled with each other even in the womb . One of them has fallen under the other ; but let simple , goodnatured Esau beware how he slacken his grip till he has got back his inheritance , for Jacob is cunninger with the tongue than he . We have said that the war has given the North a higher conception of its manhood and its duties , and of the vital force of ideas . But do we find any parallel change in the South ? We confess we look for it in vain . There is the same arrogance , the same materialistic mode of thought , which reckons the strength and value of a conntry by the amount of its crops rather than by the depth of political principle which inspires its people , the same boyish conceit on which even defeat wastes its lesson . Here is a clear case for time interference of authority . The people have done their part by settling the fact that we have a government ; and it is for the government now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it that their blood and treasure shall not have been squandered in a meaningless confLict . We must not let ourselves be misled by the terms North and South , as if those names implied any essential diversity of interest , or the claim to any separate share in the future destiny of the country . Let us concede every right to the several States except that of mischief , and never again be deceived by the fallacy that a moral wrong can be local in its evil influence , or that a principle alien to the instincts of the nation can be consistent either with its prosperity or its peace . We must not be confused into a belief that it is with States that we are dealing in this matter . The very problem is how to reconstitute safely a certain territory or populatior* as States . It is not we that take anything from them . The war has left them nothing that they can fairly call their own politically , but helplessness and confusion . We propose only to admit them for the first time into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal share in privileges , our belief in whose value we have proved by our sacrifices in asserting them . There is always a time for doing what is fit to be done ; and if it be done wisely , temperately , and firmly , it need appeal for its legality to no higher test than suecess. // It is the nation , and not a section , which is victorious , and it is only on principles of purely national advantage that any permanent settlement can be based . The South will come back to the Union intent on saving whatever fragments it can from the wreck of the evil element in its social structure , which it clings to with that servile constancy which men often show for the vice that is making them its victims . If they must lose slavery , they will make a shift to be comfortable on the best substitute they can fiuid in a system of caste . The question for a wise government in such a case seems to us not to be , Have we the right to interfere ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them alone ? If we are entitled , as conquerors , and it is only as such that we are so entitled , to stipulate for the abolition of slavery , what is there to prevent our exacting further conditions no less essential to our safety and the prosperity of the South ? The national unity we have paid so dearly for will turn out a pinchbeck counterfeit , without that sympathy of interests and ideas , that unity of the people , which can spring only from homogeneousness of institutions . The successive advances toward justice which we made during the war , and which looked so difficult and doubtful before they were made , the proclamation of freedom and the arming of the blacks , seem now to have heen measures of the simplest expediency , as the highest always turns out to be the simplest when we have the wit to try it . The heavens were to have come crashing down after both those measures ; yet the pillars of the universe not only stood firm on their divinely-laid foundations , but held us up also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not frown on an experiment of righteousness . People are not yet agreed whether these things were constitutional ; we believe , indeed , that the weight of legal opinion is against them , but nevertheless events are tolerably unanimous that without them we should have had a fine Constitution left on our hands with no body politic for it to animate . Laws of the wisest human device are , after all , but the sheath of the sword of Power , which must not be allowed to rust in them till it can not be drawn swiftly in time of need . President Lincoln had many scruples to overcome ere he could overstep the limits of precedent into the divine air of moral greatness . // Like most men , he was reluctant to be the bearer of that message of God with which his name will be linked in the grateful memory of mankind . If he won an immortality of fame by consenting to ally himself with the eternal justice , and to reinforce his armies by the inspiration of their own nobler instincts , an equal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same loyalty to conscience in the establishment of peace . We could not live together half slave and half free ; shall we succeed better in trying a second left-handed marriage between democracy and anothor form of aristocracy , less gross , but not less uncongenial ? They who before misled the country into a policy false and deadly to the very truth which was its life and strength , by the fear of abolitionism , are making ready to misrule it again by the meaner prejudice of color . We can have no permanent peace with the South but by Americanizing it , by compelling it , if *ieed be , to accept the idea , and with it the safety of democracy . At present we seem on the brink of contracting to protect from insurrection States in which a majority of the population , many of them now trained to arms , and all of them conscious of a claim upon us to make their freedom strong enough to protect them , are to be left at the mercy of laws which they have had no share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make us pause . The more thought we bestow upon the matter , the more thoroughly are we persuaded that the only way to get rid of the negro is to do him justice . Democracy is safe because it is just , and safe only when it is just to all . Here is no question of white or black , but simply of man . We have hitherto been strong in proportion as we dared be true to the sublime thought of our own Declaration of Independence , which for the first time proposed to embody Christianity in human laws , and announced the discovery that the security of the state is based on the moral instincts and the manhood of its members . In the very midnight of the war , when we were compassed around with despondency and the fear of man , that peerless utterance of human policy rang like a trumpet announcing heavenly succor , and lifted us out of the darkness of our doubts into that courage which comes of the fear of God . Now , if ever , may a statesman depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch the Snake , or Kill it ? what is simply right , for they have found out the infinite worth of freedom and how much they love it , by being called on to defend it . We have seen bow our contest has been watched by a breathless world , - how every humane and generous heart , every intellect bold enough to believe that men may be safely trusted with goveriunent as well as with any other of their concerns , has wished us God-speed . And we have felt as never before the meaning of those awful words , " Hell beneath is stirred for thee , " as we saw all that was mean and timid and selfish and wicked , by a horrible impulsion of nature , gathering to the help of our enemies . Why should we shrink from embodying our own idea as if it would turn out a Frankenstein ? Why should we let the vanquished dictate terms of peace ? A choice is offered that may never come again , unless after another war . We should sin against our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again at the South , and deliberately organized anarchy , as if it were better than war . Let the law be made equal for all men . If the power does not exist in the Constitution , find it somewhere else , or confess that democracy , strongest of all governments for war , is the weakest of all in the statesmanship that shall save us from it . There is no doubt what the wishes of the Administration are . Let them act up to their own convictions and the emergency of the hour , sure of the support of the people ; for it is one of the chief merits of our form of polity , that the public reason , which gives our Constitution all its force , is always a reserve of power to the magistrate , open to the appeal of justice , and ready to ratify the decisions of conscience . There is no need of hurry in readmitting the States that locked themselves out of the old homestead . It is not enough to conquer unless we convert them , and time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own hands . Shall we hasten to ' cover with the thin ashes of another compromise that smouldering war which we called peace for seventy years , only to have it flame up again when the wind of Southern doctrine has set long enough in the old quarter ? It is not the absence of war , hut of its causes , that is in our grasp . That is what we fought for , and there must be a right somewhere to enforce what all see to be essential . To quibble away such an opportunity would be as cowardly as unwise .
