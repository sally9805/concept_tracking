txt SCIENCE ANT ) RELIGION . To one who can set himself far enough aside from the troublesome disagreements of science and religion , to meditate propealy the grand relationship of fact and history in which they stand to each other , an almost new sense will sometimes appear to be opened , of the unity and composite wholeness of truth , which it is even a kind of sublimity to feel . It will first of all occur to him , that the oldest state of mind is not the scientific , but the religious , and that religion , wholly unscientific in its own habit , is yet the necessary precursor and pilot of science . Only as the worshipping instinct goes clear of deistic pluralities , and phantom powers that divide up the world , to embrace a one God reigning in a strictly one system , and by laws that represent both intelligence and the everlasting unity of intelligence - never until then is proper science possible . It supposes for its indispensable condition a monotheistic type of mind ; for though it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper scientific understanding can ever come , till some fit impression is gotten , or at least begins to be , of the world as a whole , related to the understanding in terms of order and law . Polytheism , or god.s in cabal under groundandabove , managing then several intrigues , and voL. i. - 1S parcelling the world in the name of government , is forever incompatible with science . The sciences of number and figure , of arithmetic and geometry , have just as good advantage in polytheism as anywhere , because the data are all on hand in the consciousness of the operator 's own mind ; and therefore it was that these sciences were so largely developed long ages ago ; even thousands of years in advance of the sciences , properly called modern , which have it for their object to explore , by experiment and observation , the actual substances and law-systems of the world . Here the intellectual unity of the world is presupposed ; for no law can be sought , or even thought , by a mind which has not beheld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some way , the sense of a transcendent affinity with mind in the general universe . Hence there is no key to nature , that can ever unlock her secrets , save the key that is given by a monotheistic religion . It may occur to some , that the Jewish people had a distinctively monotheistic religion for long ages , and yet were never a scientific people , or a people scientifically exercised . But the sufficient answer is , that they only half had their religion , being thoroughly infected with the polytheistic notions and wild // PUmAM 's IIAGAZINE. superstitions of their age , and holding even their Jehovah , almost universally , as if he were but a god among gods , only better and higher to them , because he was the God of their particular nation . Their religion never got deep enough hold of them , as a people , to regulate and shape their conceptions of the world 's order . Aristotle came even nearer to a true monotheistic conception of God , as for the understanding , than they , putting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a chapter of Paley ; and yet he could not so far exclude the plural conceptions of Deity , as to lay the necessary basis for science . This was reserved to be the special honor of Christianity , and that partly for the reason commonly charged against it ; viz. , the intensely , humanly personal figure in which the divine nature is there revealed . For if we adjourn the matter of God 's personality , and think only of nature outspread above and below-there in skies and stars , and here in land , sea , clime , and kingdom-it is doubtful whether mind would ever catch the hint of unity and law in it sufficiently to start a scientific era . But the forthcoming of God as love , in the Christian story , takes our feeling first of all , and settles the question of his intellectual and personal unity beforehand ; preparing us to look for every sort of unity , material , constitutional , providential , historical , in the works that are issued from his hand . The result will not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary , to work the supposed mental configuration . It will ei*en take whole centuries to get the new sense of divinity opened wide enough , to bring the understanding out , orlet it pass up through , into the beheld unity of the creation . For a whole thousand years , bad gods , demons , and false powers , will be thought in such relation to the true , that it will be a reasonable question , whether Christ did not die to be a ransom to the deyil ? This great , half-Manichean superstition , opposite to God 's sole magistracy , was inally conquered by Anselso , when it really seemed that a complete intellec tual monotheism was now born . And yet , so tightly does the old polytheistic and demonic machinery hold fast on the brain it has peopled with its powers , that even Luther could not see unity enough in the forces of the creation , to exclude the fear of thunder as a work of the devil . Descending now another stage lower , we find the great , strange Kepler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laws of mind , that is , of figure and number , and so to build a true science of astronomy-in which we see how near up he is getting to the notion of a supreme , all-present mind insouling law in the world . And yet we hear him talking strangelyto the " gibbous moon , " and scolding the refractory stars , that refuse to accept his formulas , or let their secret be discovered , and we really do not know whether the man is conjuring the heavens , or exploring them . But we recollect that hitherto he has been an astrologer , and that astrology has been nothing but a dealing with hidden powers that are not God-which powers are now just about to be dismissed everlastingly from the heavens , making room for mental unity and reason to occupy the world . Just here , therefore , opens the real first chapter of modern science , which we call astronomy . Another chapter scarcely less important is to follow , in due time , or as soon as may be , in the new-born science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with powers to conjure by , and as conjuring and divining had kept back the discoveries of astronomy , we know not for how long a time , so have the strange weird processes and spells of alchemy packed the world under ground with demons and dark , bad powers more difficult to be dislodged , because they have got their dominion fastened upon matter itself , more close at hand than the stars . And what shall turn men off from these incantations , conjurations , leagues with wizard powers , when they are going shortly to be shown how dirt is transmuted into gold , and phosphorus fumes into the elixir of life ; also by what wondrous // potion reluctant love may be surely captivated , and by what magic formulas , recited in the dark at dead of night , almost any spell may be compounded . The very thing wanted here , to prepare the interpretation of matter , is a thoroughgoing , absolute conception of God 's unity , and his universal reign by universal law . And if that point of advance had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the masses of the sky , it is doubtful whether it ever could have becn here , in the mineral , half mystic affinities of the ground . Now these two sciences-astronomy and chemistry-are the fruitful beginnings of our new scientific era . Given these two , all the sciences called modern must needs follow , because the seminal ideas of law are , by them , verified and set in working order . So far then we discover a most conspicuous connection between religion and science ; a prophecy and alsd pledge that the connection will be found even more signally auspicious , when their mutual working is fully consummated . As the science of nature goes on towards completion , religion , having all the while been watching for it in close company , will have gotten immense breadth and solidity , from the ideas and facts unfolded in its discoveries , and will be as much enlarged in its confidence and the sentiment of its worship , as beholding God 's dcep system in the world signifies more than looking on its surfaces . And so also science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and above them , thus to inspect the goings on of nature , not as a mill operated by fate , but as a chariot wheeled by God 's supreme liberty , will itself grow warm and free , as it gets more conversant , through nature , with the Supernatural Mind , and will make its highest reaches of discovery in the poetic and religious impulses , by which it will then finally be lifted . Such presentiments are permitted , and do , in fact , belong to both science and religion , and to one as truly as to the other . And yet , by the natural fault of both , they too often are not allowed . On the contrary , we find them largely occupied , just now , with their collisions , as they probably will be for a considerable time to come . The scripture revelations were not made to science , or by it , or in the moulds of it , but only to minds that know the facts and ob*jects of nature superficially , as they affect the senses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is a matter of no consequence , if only these are sufficiently produced , what impressions of nature are allowed to pass uncorrected . As they are beforehand stamped on the forms of language , they can be corrected only by scientific expositions , after the day of science arlives . And here it is , when science begins to arrive , that so many religious people begin to be more disturbed than they should be . They are frightened lest these scientific expositions , correcting so many popular impressions of the unscientific language , are going to sweep away the very matter of revelation in. self . They fly into panic , because this or that discbvery does not keep the customary jingle of opinions they suppose to coincide with Bible impressions ; and they fall into a nervous dread , in this manner , of science itself ; as if it were the natural enemy of religion . It passes for nothing that God is in the book of science , quite as certainly as in the book of religion , and that , being the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one , that contradicts , or at all impinges on , the truth from the other . This over-sensitive concern for religion may be taken , perhaps , as the indication of a certain sincerity , but it has the very sad fault of being exercised just as it should be , if religion had no truth at all to help it , and all the liabilities of error to keep it in jeopardy ; and by such weak , unregulated jealousy inflicts the worst dishonor and wrong that can befal it . If it be the truth , it has no attribute of mortality , and can no more be shaken by science , than science by the facts of nature ; and if it be not the truth , as these over-timid souls // 268 PUTNAM 'S MAGAZINE . appear to very nearly concede , why should we be tormented by so great concern for it ? All the worse if this concern turns easily to animosity ; for then how much can we say for the piety of it ? There is also displayed , not seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes these collisions more uncomfortable aud lower still in dignity . The point opposite to religion is how often made in a way of eagerness , that bears a flashy , partisan look , and very poorly **25;27;TOOLONG of science . The new-discovered fact , or law , is not simply announced , but appears to be delivered with aim , as a point-blank shot , that is going to bring down this or that high article of religion . It belongs to proper science , being just that highest honor which many are slow to appreciate , to simply make discovery , and cease ; for when a thing is discovered , no matter *yhat it will do or not do , or what will or will not come of it-that is no concern of science . Enough that , being once discovered as a truth , it will take care of itself and bring its own consequences . All deeply grounded , properly scientific minds are in this key , counting this to be the just nobility of their profession ; but the upstart , forward promulgators , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make their discovery , must needs magnify it , by showing what it will demolish . And it is only a matter of course , that all these freebooters of science , who go after it , not for what it is , but chiefly for the game there is in it , should be always imagining that religion is just ready to go under and finally cease , from this or that staggering blow now prepared for it . So far the collisions of science and religion are blamable in their causes , and the debates , by which their adjustments are to be liquidated , are both aggravated in their temper and hindered in their result , by the unnecessary disturbances thus contributed . Still the debate must go on , and the liquidation must be accomplished . And there is really nothing to fear from it . The temple that science is building will not be stopped by the protests of religion , and the old superstructure of religion will not be toppled to the ground , as many sad-faced people are beginning to prophesy , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen issues of capital significance have already been started , since the arrival of our modern scientific era , and it may help us to some better courage , if we very briefly glance at the inventory , and see what is in it , or , as far as may be , is to come of it . At any rate , we must not be afraid of evidence . The weakest thing possible is to make outcry against concessions to evidence ; as if it were a dangerous power that we must somehow , anyhow , master , whether by noise or strategy . In the inventory to be looked over will be comprehended , as we shall see , several varieties of cases . And first of all we will notice the cases where discoveries of science that appeared to be against religion , have already been established and have carried the general assent of religion . Thus our Copernican system of astronomy is directly against all the Ptolemaic , flat-world notions of the Scripture , and even requires us to take another centre for the creation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , that was at all comparable , for extent and square disagreement , with this . At first , the whole compact of religion was supposed to be endangered by it , and it was necessary , for a time , to do a good deal of persecution to keep religion safe . But , after four centuries of experience , we have become naturalized intellectually in the scheme ; so that we pray , and preach , and live Copernically , in the Ptolemaic language of Scripture itself apprehending no contradiction , and scarcely aware of any accommodation made . Now and then we hear of some solitary , strange person quoting Scripture against the rotations of the sphere ; much as we hear of some ancient crone , the last of her race , talking Celtic , and waiting to die with it ; but most of us very // seldom even think of any disagreement between our astronomy and our religion , and we speak habitually , with pity , of the jealous protestations once arrayed against it by the zealots of revelation . In all which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the result , in respect to all other discoveries of science that seem to impinge on religion ; it will only hold the old terminologies of Scripture in new senses , but with none the less confidence and respect . As the time goes on , too , the conformity wrought will be more easy and rapid . Thus we have geology , for example , a science born within the recollection of many , insisting , and by most convincing arguments showing , that the world was not created six thousand years ago , or then within six days , as we had been understanding Moses to teach , but in long bras of geologic transformation , or progressive history , more or less closely corresponding with the creativ* week of Genesis . And with this we are almost universally satisfied already , counting it truth enough , since there was nobody living to see the creation , that God 's high Authorship and Upholdership are so impressively presented , as a practical truth for religion . The six days ' calendar is only a frame to set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scarcely imaginable stretch of the story , by noting it as in stages of progress . We are learning , in the same way , to submit the story of the flood to qualifications which the *ritcr plainly does not make , or suppose to be necessary . That any such universal cataclysm ever befel the world the geologists think they find reason to deny ; and partly for the very conclusive reason , that there is not water enough on the planet to make such a flood . Hence it has more and more generally been conceded , since the exposition by Dr. John Pye Smith , a quarter of a century ago , that the flood was local only , not universal . If the historian supposed it to be universal , as he probably did , he plainly did not understand the configuration of the world sufficiently to be sure what he should mean by it ; and it matters little , we perceive , the main fact being given , whether , on some outer margin of the fiat he conceived , there was a rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dry land . Perhaps , too , we may take the fact reported , that " the fountains of the great deep were broken up , " as indicating an impression of some local subsidence , or disturbance . In this first class of cases , the positions held by religion have been modified by new constructions , without any sense of loss , or diminished respect for revelation . Great concern has been felt , sad outcries of danger have been heard , and even hot battle has been waged , but religion has taken her new configurations , and every thing is safe as before ; with an immense advantage gained , in the new sense of solidity added , by the crises of investigation passed . We have a second class of cases , where the conclusions of science are also established , but the effects are to come more slowly , because there is no so apparent contrariety , but only a new phase of opinion produced , that must finally work important changes of interpretation , where at first they are not expected . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are coming to look on the body in a different manner , and so on the resurrection of the body . Our constancy of type , or personal envisagement , is not maintained , as we discover , by the matter of the body , but by the formative power of the life , taking up and giving out , running in and ofl and causing the matter to flow as a river into the more permanent , presiding form of the personality . This in fact is the body , the peculiunr , the abiding type of the man ; the matter is only transitionaL It is here , it is there , it is pretty much everywhere . It has belonged , in single particles , to many thousand bodies , dead and alive , and will to many thousand more . The resurrection we look for must finally come to be , in this view , the anastasis , or emergence of the formative nature which is the real body . The gathering up of the old matter , the returning of member to member , and // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but dismissed as mere chimera . No discredit will thus be thrown upon the Christian fact of a resurrection of the body ; it will only be asserted less fantastically , and just as much more credibly . Many persons have believed , and many still believe , that when a certain contingency called a " second coming , " whatever it be , arrives , a stupendous worldcatastrophe is to be expected ; that the heavens and earth shall literally pass away , be dissolved , burned up , and a new astronomic system set in their place . But against any such impression science is steadily and surely pressing , by the suggestion that the matter of the world is largely incombustible ; that there probably is not oxygen enough in the solar system to burn it up ; that no single body can be struck out of it , or by an ounce diminished , without the gravest consequences of disorder , in all remotest worlds ; and , what is more , that the stability of the creation , demonstrated by La Place , is becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advances . The result will inevitably be , that the Scripture language referred to will be taken as being only an easternism in speech , to describe a time of great woe and commotion ; just as we do , in fact , understand the same kind of language , when Isaiah denounces a day of judgment on Idumea , and when Christ himself denounces the fall of Jerusalem . In a third class of cases , the conclusions of science , or the points of discovery maintained , are not themselves perfectly established , and we can only guess what results will follow , if they should be . Mr. Agassiz , for example , holds the opinion that what we call the human race is made up of several distinct races , all original . If the point could be established , more certainly than it appears to be , it need cost us no very great concern for the Scripture authority . We have then to ask who that people were that Cain was afraid of and among whom afterwards he found his wife ? and who the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who " the daughters of men** that stole away " the Sons of God , " perhaps of Adam , from their integrity ? adding , that a merely local flood might leave on hand descendants of them all . And when the Apostle declares that " God hath made of one blood all the nations of men , to dwell on all the face of the earth , " it must be enough to perceive , that all alike are men , separated , as such , by a chasm wider than the universe , from all the animal races ; that truth is truth to all , right the same principle and law to all , goodness the same divine quality , God the common Father , and they themselves a close high brotherhood , in terms of love and duty , having all inmost circulations of sentiment and feeling running bloodlike through them-thus to run when flesh and blood are no more . Compacted as one stock , in this manner , by the everlasting congeners of morality , mere oneness of blood , or derivation , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a type our feeling clings to , and we probably shall not give it up , till it is fairly taken from us . The geologists again are beginning , of late , to report discoveries of human remains , that must have belonged , they insist , to some pre-Adamic race , or races , existing in a different , less advanced type , before the present habitable order . Such announcements are astoundingly opposite to our previous impressions , and perhaps it will be shown , by fuller investigations , that the remains discovered belong to our present era . We can not volunteer a faith in such discoveries in advance of the proofs . It will take us a little time to settle our heads and know where we are , but we can well afford to wait on the evidence ; perceiving distinctly beforehand that there is ample room in the first few lines of Scripture , for unnumbered cycles of history anterior to the present . God existed long enough ago to create them and take care of them , and that mint suffice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under certain conjunctions arranged for the maintenance of galvanic action , they are able to beget , or create , // new forms of insect-life , without any previously existing eggs or germs . And so they account for the new families of organized life appearing , at successive stages , in the geologic progress of the earth , without any creative or miraculous intervention of God ; for the world itself they say , has a creative function , as they have experimentally discovered . Now , that any such new generation of insect-life is possible , apart from hidden germs undiscovered , we may rightly be slow to believe ; for it is antecedently improbable , nay incredible . Mind only can think the species , and adjust the subtle articulations of suchinsect-life ; acids and mineral substances and galvanic forces-all unintelligent-never did , or can do , any such thing . Indeed , if it were established , as it certainly is not , that in the given conjunctions of causes , such creations do really take place , it would be infinitely more rational to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , in such physical conjunctions , just as he allows his Spirit-power to be drawn forth by right personal conjunctions made for him in prayer . The supposed discovery , therefore , does not shake at all the faith of God 's creations . Again , we have another fourth class of cases , where the proposed point of discovery is not made out , and there is no reason to fear that it ever will be . I only cite a single example , in the Darwinian theory of the transmutation of species . What is science , anyhow , but the knowledge of species I And if species do not keep their places , but go a masking or really becoming one another , in strange transmutations , what is there to know , and where is the possibility of science ? If some original germ-cell atom may travel up through mollusc , and frog , and bug , and buzzard , and mammal , into a man , what forbids that stones may break species in the same way , to become wood and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? If there is no stability or fixity in species , then , for aught that appears , even s*cience itself may be transmuted into successions of music , and moonshine , and auroral fires . If a single kind is all kinds , then all are one , and , since that is the same as none , there is knowledge no longer . The theory may be true , but it never can be proved , for that reason if no other . And when it is proved , if that must be the fact , we may well enough agree to live without religion . There is still a fifth class of cases , where conclusions against religion are drawn from no particular disagreement , but are made to have a look of truth , from the new mental positions obtained . Thus groping his way backward through so many and vast cycles of geologic history , and yet arriving apparently no whit nearcr to God 's act of creation , the explorer faints , so to speak , in the stretch of his almanac , and drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short work , and say , that the world itself is from eternity . Be it so : nothing is therein concluded against either God 's existence or Creatorship ; for since the world so evidently bears the stamp of mind in every part , we can only judge that it is from eternity , as being from eternity created . Which again is but saying that God is from eternity Creator-a conclusion far more consonant to reason , than that he some day began to be Creator . Was he God before he was Creator ? or was he rather , in the simple fact of existence , both God and Creator ? The world , in this view , is just as truly made out of nothing-that is , nothing exterior to God  --  and is just as truly miracle , just as fit home for a supernatural religion , as if it was made yesterday . And the first chapter of Genesis suffers no trace of damage . Another conclusion , that is even fatal every way to religion , is suggested , and gets a color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature , that all events take place under fixed laws . They certainly do , we must agree to this ; but it does not follow that such fixed laws are only laws of natural causation . This article is not written by any laws of natural causation . The writer never did any thing by natural causation , unless in some hour of delirium , or sleep-walking . All // minds have laws in their ends , and a perfect mind , like the mind of God , having perfect ends , will do all things according to fixed laws by and for its ends . And imperfect minds , imperfectly co*rdinated in right ends , are none the less superior to causation . They have power , every one , to act supernaturally , coming down upon nature to put her forces into new conjunctions , and make her very causes vary their product . They do not act as being simply acted on , as a projectile is thrown , or a hammer swung , but through and from themselves , out of their inherent , everlasting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be thus acted onridden by them even as they ride their horses . And so , acting downward into it , they are doing always their small miracles upon it . Is it credible that God is himself withholden from putting his will into nature , when he gives us just this power , to be our most common equipihent ? It is very true that God can not be expected , in miracle , to overturn or suspend the fixed laws of nature . Such a definition of miracle makes it impossible . The man who lifts a weight masters gravity , but he does not suspend the law . He only puts the fiat of his will on his muscles , and , by the contracting and counter-pull of these , the weight rises . So God 's supernatural fiat acting into , or interacting with , the laws and causes of nature , may produce all miracle without disruption of order . There is no difficulty here , save in getting our own conceptions of nature and the supernatural so adjusted , as to allow their co-ordinated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this , greater than there is in perceiving , every moment , that we have actions of our own , entering freely into causes , being themselves nncaused ,  --  in which we so far do the supernatural ourselves , without having even a doubt or question raised . As regards the adjustment now of these many collisions recounted by our inventory , in the happiest and speediest way possible , two things plainly are required , both of religion and of science ; viz. , that they both consent to be complemented in each other ; and both assume to hold their ground firmly and with courage , as the truth requires . Thus religion must consent to be configured to all true points of science ; just as it has learned already , without damage and even with the greatest advantage , to hold the Bible itself in a Copernican sense . Having it on hand to convert the world , it must , in a different sense , be converted to the world . And it can never stop being thus converted , till science stops discovery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every sort of truth , else it can not be true itself . Not that the truths of nature and natural science are superior and standard as respects the truths of religion ; for scientific ideas and opinions must be willingly configured , under the same law , to the verities of religion . Truth is one  --  a complete , universal system , based in God 's all-comprehensive intelligence . And the moment either science or religion refuses to acknowledge and draw itself towards this whole of truth , it becomes ipso facto schismatic . Of course , it is not for religion to run after every newly-advertised discovery of science , and offer it obeisance , before it has had time to make due proof of its truth . And yet , when such due proof is made , and the discovery fully established , religion should greet it none the less heartily , that it sees apparent contradiction in it , but should rather begin to inquire , by what modifications the apparent disagreement can be removed , and God be set in harmony ; knowing that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gained the discovery to itself . In the same way , as already intimated , science also is required  --  a requirement which does not appear to have been much thought of as yet  --  to allow itself to be configured as punctually to the verities of religion ; doing honor always to the maxim , that the first fact of knowledge is the organic unity of all knowledge . It is not supposable , of // course , that any real fact of science is to suppress , or any way disguise itself , for the benefit of religion . Only no discoverer is at liberty , in making up his discovery , to disrespect , or volunteer a disconnection of it with any kind of truth . It is one of the particular perils , for example , of science , that the sensuous mental habit it engenders , tends to a general disrespect and quiet ignoring of all supersensuous and supernatural fact-so of religion itself . Becoming intelligent is the same thing , in this manner , as becoming atheistic , and the reality of spirit , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that compose the staple of a gospel-yes , and sometimes even the second sense and true poetic life of things , that which is the flame and principal meaning of the creation-all these are ignored , and the scientific plodder is left to spend his life in toiling at the shell of knowledge , as if it were the substance and totality . His science becomes , in this manner , a science of mere things , installed as a complete world-empire ; and refusing to know the super-mechanical forces , and vastly broader concernments of spirit , it consen4e to be either a stupendous lie , or a very cheap form of idolatry . He discovers new races appearing in the rocks , for example , and refers them not to God , but wilfully to " spontaneous generation ; ' * whereas , for God there is some presumption of evidence , and for spontaneous generation none at all . Making up his physiological account of man , he does not stop at the conclusion given him by his facts , that man is an animal , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two , it may be , to cover it , and concludes that he is only an animal-bolting purposely , as entitled to no consideration , the grand superanimal faith of immortality , never so much as conceived or conceivable by animals , but dear and natural to man and natural as dear also the much wider distinction of immutable ideas , such as truth , and right , and good , where man leaves all animals below and takes his place with God . So , more generally , going after causes in his field , and finding them working under their laws , he puts down his conclusion that all things-human actions even-are done by causes working under laws . Deep-thoughted men of all ages have thought farther , and seen more ; but he is restrained by no deferences , giving out his pronouncement , that responsibility and all supernatural facts are but fictions which philosophy will disregard . Science has no right to put itself at war , thus lightly , with old original ideas , that belong to the vast , supereminent domain of spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consents in this manner to be no more a builder , but a devastator . And then it follows , that as the bigots of religion do not know what religion is , when they refuse to allow any configuration of its word to the teachings of science , so these guerillas of science miss the very conception of nature , when they cease to look upon it as made for the uses of spirit , and by its very laws submitted to the uses of spirit . Self-active power it has none , and no man knows what it is , who does not see it open , every way ,  --  set open more and more by science itself  --  to the uses of such power , and congener , in that manner , to the properties of the supernatural . The true comprehensive wisdom here is to say , let the truth come boldly in from all quarters-out of consciousness and revelation , out of the sky , out of the ground ; and let every truth know beforehand , that it is going to meet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even as truth itself is inherently one . A second lesson , as already suggested , still remains ; that both parties are to hold their ground together , maintaining just that courage that belongs to men who belong to the truth . We suffer a certain feeling of regret when we remember that Galileo is not able to stand by his discovery , but is even coinpelled , by the tyrannical seventies of religion , to make a scarcely honorable defection from it . And if now a man of science dares not publish or publicly affirm a fact he has discovered , because // it runs counter to some standard , or scruple of his religion , how great a fall is there from the true dignity of science . The more common fault of our time is audacity . Science wants no cowards , but real courage dares to be considerate . Let us have discovered all that is best , and all that is worst , but never any thing which is not exactly true . But the more difficult thing , in this matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the side of religion . The demonstrations of religion , as related to science , bear a look , just now , that is not inspiring , or is even a little humiliating ; a look of demoralization , or chronic weakness , that is turning one way or another for help , and seemingly can not find it . As if there were no power left in religion , to withstand the inroads of scientific naturalism , and every thing were verging towards a final precipitation of faith and authority ! Nothing could be more unworthy , or in fact more false . We have indeed been called to revise a good many of our supposed knowledges , and some that we derived , as we thought , from the Scripture ; but there is not any one of them which damages either us or it . The concessions we are yielding to science make no breach on the subjectmatter of revelation ; they only touch certain incidentals of form and language , where the Scriptures are on a par , as to their conceptions of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written for stands unshaken still , and is even the more firmly settled , that it has been able to survive the perils of so broad a reconstruction . See what changes have been sweeping by . The flat world that was laid on pillars , rounding into a sphere , has broken loose , in swift motion , rushing strong and far . The heaven that was decked with spangles has become a vast worldempire , stable as geometry itself . Matter has become incombustible , ha*g its very atoms yoked in the count of arithmetic . The counsel that turns about the clouds has been discovered , and clouds themselves trod under by human feet . The waters have been measured , and the seas explored and well-nigh bridged . Even our bodies are seen to have their constancy no more in their matter , but wholly in the shapeelement under which they are ever being recomposed . A thousand misconcep .. tions are corrected , and a thousand short-conceptions enlarged . And yet every thing in religion stands even the more securely ; as we see it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once so pliant , and so visibly superior . Our true part , then , is to be as little concerned for the safety of religion as we have reason to be . The future outbreaks of discovery are not likely to bring us a single peril more . And since we have ample space left us as ever , for all most supernatural gifts-revelations , prayers , anointings , discernings , and even miracles  --  and no possible discovery can rob us of these liberties of the spirit , or more than help us to maintain them systematically , as having found their intelligible unity with science itself , what shall we do but pledge our right hand to it and to all its explorations ? We are to say , Go on , gentlemen , for there is a much larger field to be possessed . As yet you have but scratched the world 's surfaces , in what you call your sciences . Go deep ; for the deeper you go , and the more unsparing your search , the better it will be for us . Wrench @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and let us have it . We shall appropriate every true thing you bring us , and thank God for it . Only bring us no conceit , as if nature were the all , and science the all-expounder . What you call nature is but a very small affair , compared with God 's high spirit-empire , and the vast immortal quantities , and powers , and passions , and truths , that build the eternal system it composes . Do not imagine that you are in a commission large enough to include and give you jurisdiction of things supernatural , when your only jurisdiction is of the shell . Be not in haste to put your sentence on the faiths of religion . The nursery-sparrow that boasts " I killed Cock Robin , " could as well be sure // qwq
