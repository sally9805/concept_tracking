txt The past two or three days an immense amount of furs and buffalo robes have been received by Pembina carts , and also by rail , from the Hudson Bay region . We saw yesterday at the railroad depot nearly one thousand bales of buffalo robes , making a pile as high as a house . They are being rapidly shipped below . There are ten robes in each but . dle , making nearly ten thousand robes in all , worth from $10 to $12 each . These are but a portion of those on the way down , which are estimated at fifteen or twenty thousand . In addition to the buffalo robes , there have been about a hundred bundles of wolf skins and other furs , many of them very valuable . In all.there will probably be $300,000 worth of furs received at St. Paul this season , fully up to the amount marketed here in previous years and maintaining the rank of St. Paul as one of the largest fur markets in the world . About 160 Red River carts were yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stores , preparatory to making the long trip back to their hunting grounds on the shores of Lake Winnepeg , the Saskatchewan and Red Rivers . Business , consequently , was unusually lively among the wholesale dealers , and the streets were crowded with the unmistakable residents of the far Northwest , whose pecularities of feature and costume are as distinctive as if they belonged to another race , JOSEPH LEMAY , Collector at Pembina , W. G. FoNSECA , Esq. , of Fort Garry , and several other gentlemen from that quarter , are also in the city on bit inese relating to the vast amount of furs brought down from the Red River Region . From Mr. FONSECA we learn that the dismantling of the forts of Pembina and other points along the Red River , in connection with the hostile attitude of the Sioux across the border , produces some degree of disgust among the inhabitants of that region . There is , however , little likelihood of any irruption of the savages upon the settlements along the frontier , as it is a historical fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and every hostile party that has made its appearance has been exterminated . It would , however , be the part of wisdom to have the frontier properly guarded , and if possible have small forces stationed at the forts which have been erected at considerable coat to the Government . The crops in the Selkirk settlement are said to be nourishingly luxuriant , but the grasshoppers are already making their appearance , and some fears are entertained that their visit will be disastrous to vegetation .
