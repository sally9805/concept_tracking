Life of Marcus Tullius Cicero . By WILLIAM FORSYTH . London : John Murray . 2 vols. 1864 . THE great epic poet of the Augustaii age , secure in the strength of the newly organized Empire , pictures the shade of Anchises foretelling to his son the greatness of the nation he was about to found . " Tn regere iniperio populos , Romane , memento . " Could Virgil have seen the extent and duration of that sway ; could he hay discerned , looking down the vista of centuries , the destruction of the political fabric which surrounded him , while the ideas on which it was based yet mas // The Fowsdatios of tAo Rousae . Empire . Jan. tered the world ; could he have known that peoples of diverse origin and language should construct their civilization upon a Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the Danube and the Rhine , sending a shudder to the heart of the Imperial city , should all be brought in the progress of the ages into subjection to a power which issued from the circle of the seven sacred hills on the banks of the Tiber , - his heart might have swelled with a morp exultant pride , and in even loNer strains he might have sung the glories of the mistress of nations . This destiny was not revealed to the poet 's vision ; but we of another race , and of a civilization &amp;rther from the Roman type than that of the western nations ot the European continent , must consider with wonder and admiration the irresistible power of that people , who , after conquering the hon world by their arms , possessed a vitality sufficient even in their overthrow , to project their ideas into the institutions of their conquerors , to work like a leaven , until they had penetrated the whole mm , and by a wonderful chemistry had transformed it into their own likeness . The extent and importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern Europe and of America is hardly to be over-estimated . The languages which are more or less directly derived from the Roman tongue serve to keep alive in the common speech something of the habits of thought of the Roman people ; for words , in one sense , are not the mere arbitrary signs of ideas , but.ideas once linked to them are perpetuated through the most radical and violent changes , changes that have been able even to sever all outward connection between those who originally wedded the thought and the utterance , and those to whom the yinited pair have descended . Savigny has shown that many of the municipal institutions left existing throughout Italy and the Western provinces , spared by the barbarians amid the general wreck of the state polity , were the means of preserving during the Middle Ages , and even under the fierce domination of feudalism , a type of organization which dated back to the Empire in its vigor and integrity . But it is chiefly by her jurisprudence , that consummate product of her organizing power , that perfected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gulf of the ages , and still directs so much of the social relations of modern times . Not only is this continued sway to be recognized in those states which have professedly based their legal systems upon the codifications of Justinian , but England , and through her America , must acknowledge the vast contributions made to their private law by the Roman legislation . It is not strange that the history of such a nation has been the study of scholars , jurists , and statesmen of all countries ; but it is strange that hitherto English literature has afforded no means of tracing the course of the Roman state from its birth amid the barbarous tribes , who collected on the banks of the Tiber , to its death on the shores of the Bosphorus . Gibbon , unsurpassed in the extent of his learning and the minuteness of his research by the most diligent of Germans , has indeed narrated with such mastery the decline and fall of the Empire , as to prevent all attempts at rivalry ; and Arnold , the disciple but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Roman state , and has followed its progress until it had fairly commenced its career of conquest . But the connecting link between these extremes has been wanting . The story of the Republic , flushed with success , but overwhelmed by her own power , and decayed at the core by the vices of all her citizens ; of the utter corruption and venality which spread through all departments of the state , until a reconstruction of society became necessary ; of the final struggle of the oligarchy , who perpetuated the traditions of the early and exclusive rule of the populus , with the middling classes and provincials , whose power was constantly increasing ; of the new birth through which the nation passed with many terrible throes ; of the rise of the Empire until it reached its culminating point and began its downward course , had not yet been told by an English historian . The work of Mr. Merivale is written to supply this most important gap , and to complete the tale of the Roman state . It will be most welcome to every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place by the side of Arnold and Gibbon . In his Life of Cicero , Mr. Forsyth has been compelled to make many references to the condition of public affairs in which the // great orator took so prominent a part ; but still those references arc incidental , and the author has not been drawn away from his legitimate functions as a mere biographer to attempt the more arduous task of the historian . His book is a valuable contribution to our standard literature , and we are pleased to learn that it is soon to be reissued in this country . Its style may be obnoxious to criticism ; it lacks the easy flow and calm dignity of Mr. Merivale 's narrative ; it strains too much after effect , and occasionally becomes flippant or inflated . But it is a work which will aid our progress towards the truth ; it lifts a corner of the veil which has hung over the scenes and actors of times so full of ferment , and allows us to catch a glimpse of the stage upon which the great drama was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , and permitted us to gaze without obstruction upon the arena where so many antagonistic principles , represented by opposing parties , were contending for existence and supremacy . Among the duties of the accurate and conscientious historian , not the least important is the correction of the mistakes and false impressions of those who have preceded him , even . though they may have the sanction of authority , and be accepted as a part of the common opinion of mankind . Especially must he subject the accounts of those writers contemporary with the events he narrates to a careful criticism , and detect , if possible , their errors of statement and colorings of passion and prejudice . In this respect Mr. Merivale has done the cause of truth good service . We believe that the reader will rise from these volumes disabused of many notions which he had derived from ordinary histories and from familiar Latin authors . The actors in the great struggle which preceded the death of the Republic will appear in a new light . We doubt not that , according to the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the merits of those engaged in the contest which terminated in the dictatorship of Julius Ciesar , that great man was impelled only by an unbridled ambition , to which the liberties of the people , the government of the Commonwealth , and even the structure of society , must be sacrificed , in order that lie // might be raised to sole power over the ruined state ; while in tue prosecution of his designs he made use of the vilest and lowest populace of the city , ever ready to be bought by those who would purchase their services at the highest price . To those who have thus interpreted his character , the party of the Senate , of Pompelus , of Cicero , of Cato , of Brutus , represented what was virtuous in the Republic , struggling to preserve the ancient liberties and the constitution under which Rome had advanced to greatness , against the attacks of an unprincipled though powerful faction , led by a man dangerous because of his pre-eminent abilities as a military commander , and his unbounded influence over the blinded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motives were set forth by those who wrote at or near the period of which we speak , in the interest and with the prejudices of the nobility ; and they have been constantly reproduced by succeeding authors , until they have come to be generally adopted as correct . The critical investigations of modern Continental scholars have , however , led them to question the truth of this h ) icture ; and among the recent English students of history , DeQuincey has perceived how hollow were the pretensions of the Senatorial faction to be called the friends of liberty , and has detected their true character as an effete and odious oligarchy , aiming to destroy the rights of all other classes in the state in the endeavor to secure and confirm their own privileges , until the middling orders , which embraced much of the wealth and all of the elements that give stability and power to a nation , were led to rise against them , and , under the leadership of their great advocate , friend , and captain , to throw off the hated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogmatically stated by DeQuincey in the glowing diction of one of his essays , Mr. Merivahe has now set forth in plain and perspicuous narrative , and supported by overwhelming proofs drawn from a comparison of all contemporary writers . But although history thus serves to throw light upon the acts and motives of the men who have beeim pre-eminent iw a nation 's public affairs , and enables us to form a correct judgmnent of their characters , this is an incident merely to its grander and more bigitimate purposes . Its great object is to discover // and exhibit the national forces which have swept along individuals and institutions in their irresistible progress , - the essential causes which have led to known and positive results . Its province is to trace those elements which , interwoven from the beginning into the life of a state , or added from without by violence , or adopted from choice , have exerted a controlling sway over a people 's destiny , and have determined the external forms of their social activity , and the internal character of their civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value to the citizen and the statesman are drawn ; by the side of these , all disputes or questions about the character and merits of particular persons , however important may have been their part in history , are comparatively insignificant . The first C*sar perished before the work he had attempted was complete ; but that work would have been done had he never lived . Those potential forces which compelled him , as well as the nation , did not depend for their existence upon his life , although he had the sagacity to perceive , and the strength of will to wield and direct them . We propose , as far as the limits of a single article will permit , to describe some of the most important of those essential causes which acted upon Roman society , and the progress of events through which they worked out their legitimate results in the overthrow of the paramount control of the nobility , the downfall of the Republic , and the establishment of a powerful and concentrated government based upon the principle of absolutism . M. Guizot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roman society was entirely of a municipal character ; that its organization took the city as its type ; and he ascribes to this cause the incoherence , and the constant ten dency to disintegration , which made a central and absolute power finally necessary to hold its separate parts iii union and subjection . As is true of many of M. Guizot 's historical generalizations , this statement is to be taken with much limitation . The Roman genius for order , unequalled by that of any other people , which produced the wonderful system of jurisprudence whence so many modern nations have borrowed , not only the general ideas , but the minutest details of their laws , // did also display itself in the municipal organizations throughout Italy and the provinces , whose perfection gave them such stability , that not a few survived the shock of barbarian in-. vasion and feudal violence , and developed into the free commercial republics of the Middle Ages . But it is not true that , during the later period of the Commonwealth , or under the Empire , the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so in the earliest ages of the Roman states , when the Populus and Plebs were held within the circuit of the sacred walls , when the contiguous nations were mere collections of isolated and fortified towns perched upon the summits of rocky eminences , and the Roman colonies were the armed occupants of some newly captured fastness or outlying city in the territory alternately overrun by the armies of the Republic and its enemies . But the subjugation of the entire peninsula of Italy , and the consequent transfer of active hostilities to a distance from its soil , was accompanied with the rapid and extensive growth of a population permanently rural , either distributed upon farms , or collected into villages . The same was true in those western provinces , which had been the earliest conquered and the longest exposed to the influence of Ro* man civilization . The ancient isolation of the municipalities passed away ; and the intervening country was filled up with resident occupants , who enga0ed with zeal in the terrible struggles which preceded and attended the destruction of the old constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition of the Roman people than its mere outward form of organization , to find those controlling causes which led to the establishment of the imperial rule . During the entire period of the Commonwealth , from its origin , upon which a vague tradition serves to throw the only light , through its proud career of development in civilization and expansion in territory , until the revolution accomplished under the first C*esar , we can discover two opposed elements in the Roman state giving shape to all its institutions . Indeed , during the early centuries of its existence , Rome was not so much a single state as two repellent , and often openly hostile states , engaged in a fierce and determined contest , but held together by bonds sufficiently strong to prevent their vio // lent separation . Of these , one was dominant , the other subject . To the former - the Populus , the burghers of primitive Rome - belonged all the rights of citizenship given by the private law , all political privileges , and the power of managing and carrying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or commons-were a conquered people , brought in and annexed to the body politic , not incorporated with it , who were left at first to the principles of ' natural justice for many of the legal rules which guided their private relations , and who , not being a part of the state , derived no benefit from it except protection . Required to fight its battles , they had no share in the fruits of its victories , and no voice in the direction of its public acts . From this primitive condition of the two orders , there was a constant attempt on the one side to produce , and on the other to prevent , a complete assimilation and fusion of both elements into one . The whole internal domestic history , and much of that which relates to the foreign policy of the Republic , is simply a record of this struggle , varied by many alternations of success and defeat , but still constantly progressing , until the whole people , of the city and of the provinces , were joined in a common citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent , was animated by the same national sentiments . It was the work of centuries to accomplish this vast result . The old constitution had been devised when the original ideas of two distinct orders were in their full vigor , and it was framed to uphold and preserve this division . The gradual but sure progress of other ideas , the longing after unity , the restless demands of commons and provincials to be admitted to an equal share of the government , had strained this ancient political fabric to the utmost . Before the destiny of Rome could be accomplished , its ancient institutions , sacred by so many memories , must give way , and be supplanted by others through which the new life might develop itself . Much of this advance had been accomplished before the first Ca*sar arose to bring the reign of the old system to an end . The course of centuries had already wrought a great change in the social organization , so that , long before the close of the Republic , the ancient formal distinction between the Populus // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controlled the acts and prescribed the duties of the whole people ; the choice of rulers and the direction of the state , so far as they were determined by voting at the elections , were committed to all classes of citizens ; and even the full right of citizenship had been granted to many who were not dwellers on the original Roman soil , while a partial right had been freely bestowed among the inhabitants of large portions of Italy . The causes of this revolution were many . Among the most important , without doubt , was the fact that , as the plebeians be.gan to form the bulk of the armies , they grew to be an essential element in carrying out the national ideas of conquest , and were thus led continually to assert their independence and to acquire political power . At a very early day , the aristocracy , with their more complete organization and their more concentrated class feeling , could dispense with the aid of the inferior populace , and found little difficulty in maintaining their own supremacy . But as wars grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the armies were changed from roving bands of marauders into equipped and trained battalions , it was from the ranks of the plebeians that the mass of fighting-men must be drawn , for purposes either of protection or of invasion . Thus a most important advantage was given to the commons in their struggles with the patricians , which their leaders were not slow to use , and by means of which they finally achieved a permanent victory for their own order . Another cause , more obscure but hardly less efficient , to which historians have scarcely attributed a due influence , lent its aid in elevating the commonalty to an equal share in the control of state affairs . This was the constant and steady progress of the private jurisprudence from its primitive rudeness and severity , its unnatural distinctions and technical rules , to a nearer agreement with the principles of justice and equity . A nation 's law is always the result and exponent of its civilization , but it is more : as its development keeps pace with that of the state , it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stimulant to a further advance . Especially is this // true in those countries where the law is the continuous product of tribunals acting independently of the executive , and comparatively free from the restraints of statutory legislation . Such is the law of England and America , and such was that of Rome . Although at the time of Cicero this jurisprudence had only reached a middle point of its growth , yet even then the pr*etors , as the constitutional organs by which the discussions of learned jurisconsults became clothed with the binding quality of law , had made marked and important improvements in the ancient code . Possessing a legislative function similar in principle to that of our own judges , they had broken down much of the arbitrariness of the early law , and had raised a new and imposing superstructure upon the old foundations of the Twelve Tables . In the domestic relations , in the rules of property , of inheritance , and of obligations , their innovations were plainly felt , and the whole private jurisprudence had made an approximation to that homogeneity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The effect of this constant improvement in the rules of the municipal law - penetrating as it did into the private life and relations of the citizens , shaping all their intercourse , clothing their obligations with a character of abstract right instead of technical form , defining their duties , regulating the acquirement , transmission , and ownership of their property - must have been very powerful in producing an approach towards equality , not only in the social condition , but in the political functions of the different orders of the people . It aided in the downfall of the aristocracy , drew all classes closer to each other , and hastened the time when the Roman Commonwealth should he a unit . But these great and most important changes in the old constitution had not yet resulted in that consummation which was necessary in order that the Roman people might reach the height of their greatness and the full development of their civilization . Although the Licinian and the Publilian laws had swept away the distinction between the Plebs and the Populus , and the assemblies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mere empty form , a wide interval still separated the different orders in the Commonwealth , and a // long course of the nation 's life must be passed over before these should be completely assimilated and moulded into one mass , possessing coherence and the power of common hopes and aspirations . But the tendency to union , which had effected so much , would not rest until its work had been entirely accomplished , and the city , Italy , and the provinces had become but parts of one grand whole , embracing the world in its bounds . The old idea of duality had indeed lost much of its intensity , but it was still controlling in the practical administration of public affairs . If patricians and plebeians had disappeared as distinct castes in the state , they had left behind them parties who inherited their memories , preserved their ideas , and endeavored to carry out their policy . On the one hand was an aristocracy which succeeded to all of the worst characteristics of the ancient patrician order , without possessing any of those nobler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride and arrogance , the exclusiveness , the contempt for those of recent families who had raised themselves by merit , the determined resistance to any attempt to abridge their own privileges , the zeal for the supremacy of their own order , Were still characteristic of the nobility of the later Republic ; but the simplicity of manners and the purity of morals , the lofty devotion , the stern virtue , the exalted patriotism which elevated the thought of Rome as a state above all other thoughts , and by that very means raised their own rank , in their estimation , as the crowning ornament and excellence of the civil fabric , - these had gone , and their place was supplied by those selfish passions and motives which belong to a corrupt oligarchy , and serve to render it the most odious of all forms of society . The stronghold of this party was the Senate ; and although the magistracies were open to all citizens , it was able , through the prestige of its position and of its inherited ideas , through the personal influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblushing use of bribery and intimidation , to control most of the elections , the popular assemblies for the enactment of laws , the bench of tribunes , and even the judges to whom was committed the duty of deciding the questions involved in criminal prosecutions . // On the other hand , the commons had been succeeded by the great body of citizens , both those of Roman and those of Italian birth . To them all the avenues to distinction and political power were theoretically open ; for the elections were nominally free , and any citizen might aspire to the highest offices in the Republic . In fact , not a few were successful in reaching the goal of a Roman 's ambition ; the ranks of the nobility were not unfrequently recruited by persons of humble origin , - " new men , " in the language of the times , - who had risen by their own merit in the field or the forum , attained to curule magistracies , and were thus entitled to a scat in the Senate . Pompeius and Cicero , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle with Julius C*esar , were examples of this class of recent nobles . While such successful partisans , fresh from the contests of the state , with the experience and skill afforded by long service at home and abroad , were thus adding strength to their adopted order , and infusing life and vigor into it , they were covertly despised by their brethren of ancient family . The oligarchy was willing to use their services , but it seldom gave them its confidence . Although an opportunity of engaging in the administration of the government was thus apparently afforded to all citizens , and although upon a superficial view it would seem that the nobility , from their comparatively small numbers , might have been set aside , and deprived of a controlling share in the public acts of the state , through the constitutional means of the elections , the tribunes , and the assemblies , yet in fact their power still continued almost supreme . What , they lacked in numerical force , they more than made up by their party discipline , and by their constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be thwarted , or the popular opinions misguided . They were thus able to oppose a steady resistance to any alterations of the laws which would lessen their own power or increase that of the rival party . It was only at times , when the whole body of the people , under the championship of such a leader as C*esar , united in pressing a demand , with the evident purpose of enforcing compliance , that the nobility would sullenly withdraw their opposition , and suffer the reformatory legislation to proceed . // To the popular party among the citizens in the later days of the Republic was added the great mass of the provincials , among wbom the Roman civilization had made some progress , and who were henceforth to live either as integral parts of the state , or as mere dependents upon it . Doubtless , at this time , no class at Rome entirely apprehended the importance of these provincials as elements of the Commonwealth . None clearly perceived that the exhaustion of the native stock was to be supplied from this source ; that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imperial greatness of Rome would be a result of the spread of common sentiments and a united political activity among the peoples who bordered on the Mediterranean . The haughty exclusiveness which had anciently cherished the idea of the citizen as something peculiarly sacred , and had surrounded it by bulwarks built upon the very foundations of the private law and tIme public constitution , had in a greet measure givemi way . Foreign intercourse , the extension of territory , with the consequent political necessity of making some additions to the ranks of the citizens from among the Italian states , and the amelioration of the private law by the free introduction of equitable principles , had done much to soften this old harshness of feeling towards other nations , to weaken this once profound conviction of the essential superiority of Roman birth and lineage . But the change was a partial one . Among the popular party , who were not bound by the traditions of the patrician supremacy , the greater progress had been made , the nearer approach to an acknowledgment of the brotherhood of mankind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who composed the state , both citizens and provincials . Probably some of their leaders , and especially Camsar , perceived the necessity for a breaking down of the barriers of separation , and contemplated a Commonwealth one and indivisible , as the result of the contest which had been going on so long , and was now approaching its conclusion . Whatever undefined sentiments or well-founded expectations might have been held by others , the position of the aristocracy , as a ruling class , towards the provincials , could not be mistaken . They had firmly opposed and would continue to resist any attempt at an extension of citizenship , any project which // Jan. looked towards an incorporation of these dependents into the Commonwealth . Such measures were antagonistic to the whole traditional policy of their order , would weaken their grasp upon power , and threaten their political supremacy . Motives more sordid , and perhaps more cogent than these , gave intensity to opinions which had a natural origin in class feelings and prejudices . The provinces had long been the unfailing sources of supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and as the higher magistracies were almost entirely filled by members of the aristocracy , that party came to look upon these regions as their own peculiar ground , from which they might levy contributions to replenish their private coffers . Accustomed as we are to the well-regulated governments of our own day , in which the rights of property are respected , and such an approach towards purity in the public administration is attained , that bribery and corruption and official peculation are exceptional , and are carefully conceakd from the public knowledge , we can scarcely appreciate the condition of the Roman provinces under pro-consular and pro-praThorian rule . The race for the political honors of the Republic was no easy one . Success itself was expensive ; the candidate must expend his means with a lavish hand ; when his own resources were exhausted , he must draw on those of his friends ; and when these proved unavailing , resort must be had to the usurer . But to the candidate who was thus impoverisf*ing himself and his friends , a glittering prize constantly appeared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allure him on through any labor , and to reward any sacrifice . He knew that , as soon as the somewhat empty homier of the pr*torship or the consulship was ended , a province stood ready to receive him and furnish the substantial recompense for his outlays . There he confidently expected to pay all his indebtedness , to enrich all his friends and followers , and to amass a boundless fortune for himself . His power as provincial governor was unlimited ; no counterpoise in the political machinery checked his movements . The arts and appliances for extorting money from a subdued people had been cultivated to perfection , and he was master of them all . The constitution , indeed , afforded a single safeguard to the // rights of the provincials ; but even that the ruling faction had been able to thwart and turn entirely to its own profit . At the expiration of his term of office , the late magistrate , now a private citizen , might be impeached by his recent subjects , and brought to trial upon charges of corruption or oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The systematic bribery of the judges , who were largely taken from their order , was a part of the tactics of the oligarchy ; and this practice was so universally known , and the results were so well understood , that a conviction was never even apprehended by the accused . The successful prosecution of Verres first startled the aristocracy in their security , and showed them that their peculiar measures had been pushed too far , and that a pursuing Nemesis might already be awakening . These reasons couspired to throw the provincials as a body into the arms of the popular party , which thus enjoyed whatever aid could be afforded by the moral support , the hearty good wishes , and the material resources of its allies . Already , before the final struggle , had the opposing forces of the people and of the aristocracy met in bitter and bloody conflict . At first the former were triumphant in the resort to arms , and Marius for a while held undisputed sway through the state . But , though a brave and successful captain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political leader ; he had nothing of the quality which we call statesmanship . He was strong in opposing and overthrowing , but he had no constructive power . His death left his party in no condition to maintain the supremacy which they had temporarily acquired ; no general schemes of legislations tending to enforce their ideas had been inaugurated ; no progress had been made , except the substantial incorporation of the Italians into the Roman Commonwealth . The reaction followed , and the oligarchy were restored to their former position ; they were even strengthened in it , and recovered many important privileges which they had been forced to abandon a generation or two before . Their leader , Sulla , was an ideal aristocrat , He outraged all sentiments of justice , he proscribed , he massacred , upon principle ; not for his own aggrandizement , nor from any thirst for blood , or passion of cruelty , but with a cool and // calculating design to promote the advantage of his own order , and settle forever the disputes which had distracted the Republic . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supremacy of the Populus was unquestioned , and the commons were an inferior and subject race . As soon as he supposed his work was complete , and the oligarchy so firmly established that no civil commotions could overthrow it , he resigned his power , that his class might alone reap the advantage of their triumph in him . But , though stunned , the spirit of opposition , that spirit in which were expressed the sentiments of the great body of citizens and of all the provincials , was not dead . It soon revived , and prepared for a more determined struggle under a leader who was wise enough to understand the wants of the age and of the state , and skilful enough to combine and direct all the forces which tended to the great end of unity and comprehension . We do not propose to sketch the life of Julius Ca3sar , or to narrate the successive steps of his rise to power , or to describe his gradual concentration of the popular elements , until by one blow he toppled over the fabric which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this eventful career are too familiar to need recapitulation . How well defined and complete a plan C*esar had proposed for himself , how consciously he was carrying out the principles of unity against those of exclusion , we can only judge from his acts and from his general character . His writings exhibit a remarkable reticence , and disclose nothing of the course of thought which occupied his mind . At the same time , the thorough scholarly culture of the man is nowhere more clearly shown than in the fact that his works , written amid the cares and business of the camp , are models of a pure idiomatic Latinity . But when we review the whole course of C*sar 's life , hisearly identification of himself with a party then depressed , his steady pursuit of a single object , his careful organization of the means with which he was to work , so that he had but to put them in motion and the work was done , and , finally , the manner in which lie met and used success , we must admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of glory and power for their own sakes ; we must confess that with his ambition nobler and // more statesmanlike qualities were joined , which gave color and character to his public acts . C*sar was the single Roman of his times who fully comprehended the genius and destiny of his nation . He read the meaning of the party strifes ; he had watched the ebb and flow of the popular will , and noticed that , with all its fluctuations , it was rising higher and higher . Of old patrician family , and knowing when and how to appeal to the natural feelings of admiration for those of ancient lineage , he had broken away from the prejudices of his class , and had formally and forever cut himself off from the past . It was the studied policy of his life to sever also the bonds which held the state to the traditions , forms , and ideas of a bygone time , and thus to give it freedom of action in the course of development which lay before it . The Romans , from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the letter of the law . Even the Twelve Tables had enacted , as the very basis of all obligations , " Ubi lingua nuncupasset , ita jus esto . " They clung to the outward form when the spirit and life had departed . But to C*sar , above all his countrymen , was given the clear vision that pierced through the husks , the carefully folded envelopes of things , and saw the substance in its naked simplicity . He was impatient of mere forms which no longer symbolized any living fact . Fully convinced that the pyetensions of the aristocratic party were utterly irreconcilable with the claims of the popular party , and that their policy was entirely opposed to the interests of the Commonwealth , and that , if carried out , it would dwarf the growing society , produce premature decay and decrepitude , and arrest the destiny of Rome , he plainly perceived that no compromise was possible with them . He saw that one or the other must triumph in the complete destruction of its rival 's power . Which should be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to organizing the victory , so that it should be at once thorough and comparatively bloodless . At the same time , he recognized the fact that the old constitution was insufficient for the needs of the Commonwealth ; and that , in the very triumph of liberal ideas , it must be overthrown . The yearly consuls , the general elections , the assemblies for voting upon proposed laws , the appeal of public // criminals to the tribunal of the people , were institutions devised and fitted only for a purely municipal society , - a society at once compact and united . They were outgrown when the right of citizenship was extended over the Italian peninsula , and especially when the Mediterranean was fringed with dependent provinces , which must receive their law from the central city . As a necessary result , the control of the administration came into the hands of a few leaders , and of the populace of Rome itself , to the exclusion , except on extraordinary occasions , of the mass of Italian citizens , and to the utter denial to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , was the condition which the oligarchy favored and strove to make perpetual ; but it was a condition of national paralysis , and would soon end in national death . These institutions , then , as methods by which the government was administered , had become mere forms ; their usefulness had ended ; they were only hindrances in the progress of the state towards maturity . The consummation of the struggle which had now lasted since the banishment of the kings , the success of liberal ideas and of an enlarged policy , must be accompanied by a reconstruction of society , a remodelling of the state , a redistribution of the functions of government . Old names might be retained , many old forms preserved ; but the substantial power must be lodged somewhere beyond the caprice of the urban populace and the reach of a bigoted aristocracy , where it would be wielded for the benefit of the whole commonwealth , and would thus inevitably tend to draw together all portions into a united empire . For this result Oa*sar prepared by a long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ; and when the time to strike had come , when the oligarchy , by their mad persistence , had left no alternative but a hostile movement or his own destruction , he put the forces which he had perfected into motion , and the overthrow of the aristocratic faction was immediate . They were forced at once to retire from the city and from Italy , to abandon the government , and to mass their military resources in a distant province , there to await attack . This very suddenness of their fall shows that the oligarchy had no hold upon the affections of the people , - that their boasted // championship of liberty and ord , er was universally understood to be a sham . The final conflict soon came , was short and decisive , and iRome was regenerated . The victory of C*sar was worthy of himself , of the principles he represented , and of the party he led . It only needs to be compared with the acts by which Pompeius and the Senate had determined to follow up their assumed success , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as a triumph of more advanced and comprehensive political ideas of the nation itself over those who looked upon the state as their own exclusive patrimony , to be managed for their personal aggrandizement . Even Cicero , who thoroughly knew his own partisans , and who had barely escaped with his life from their violence , was forced to confess that a victory of Pompeins would have been accompanied by indiscriminate proscriptions and massacres , and that even those who had remained quiet in their own homes , refusing to join either army , had been doomed to death ; while C*sar had exhibited a leniency unexpected by his adversaries , but which marked the natural generosity of his character and the elevation of his policy . Indeed , when all armed opposition had been overcome , he trusted no longer to his soldiery , but threw himself with perfect faith upon the people . Many of the Senatorial leaders had perished in battle , a very few had been banished or put to death , while the remainder had given in their adherence to the new order of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Dictator . All seemed to be safe ; confidence would beget confidence ; the people were more than satisfied ; the necessity for the army was ended . We can only conjecture how the supreme power which he had thus reached would have been practically used in reconstructing a system of state polity out of the fragments of the shatterud republican constitution ; but we have a right to judge from . the past life of the Dictator , and from his moderation in success , that much would have been done for the benefit of the whole Commonwealth . What particular course of legislation he would have adopted , how extensive and complete would have been his plans of comprehension , whether he would at one blow have accomplished all his intended reforms , or whether he would have proceeded gradually in his work , are interesting // Jan. subjects for speculation ; but beyond speculation we can not reach . We may be sure that no return would have been made to the former constitution ; probably not even such a resemblance to republican forms would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state at the time , and the subsequent course of events , leave no room for doubt , however , that the premature death of C*sar was a loss to the Roman nation not to be measured by words . His assassins , in gratifying their private pique , in avenging their personal slights and fancied wrongs , under the sacred name of liberty , inflicted a blow upon their country from which it never entirely recovered , even during the long course of imperial rule . This act renewed the civil war , and made it one of extermination . The oligarchy had been thrust from its exalted station , but many of its members were yet living , enjoying their estates and honors , and not forgetful of their former pre-eminence . C*sar 's power was firm so long as lie lived ; so far as it depended upon his personal influence , it was secure ; but it had not yet become incorporated into the governmental functions of the state ; no dynastic measures had been arranged to perpetuate it , no general legislation matured to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet been adopted as the national policy , to be carried out after his life was ended . On the other hand , the events of the last two generations , and especially of the career just closed , rendered it plain that the ideas of the popular party had gained the ascendant , that the exclusiveness of the aristocratic rule was forever broken . But the sudden death of C*sar revived the hopes of the fallen faction , who regarded liberty and the Republic but as synonymous of their own supremacy . The civil war broke out afresh , and everything conspired to make the conflict bitter and bloody . On the one side , the shame of recent defeat and the hope springing up out of despair , on the other , feelings of revenge and motives of personal ambition , gave a deadly character to the hatred , and added fierceness to every blow . The loss of C*sar deprived his party of the one leader who combined military skill , political sagacity , and indomitable will with generous impulses and lofty , comprehensive aims . Antonius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // moderate abilities would have sufficed to control the storm that now raged through the state , - but neither of them was a Julius . Still , under their leadership , the issue of the conflict now waged with the remains of the oligarchy was never doubtful ; by what measures their success would be accompanied was , unhappily , no less certain . The day that saw Cicero* s head and hands iiailed to the rostra , insulted by a coarse Autonius and an infamous Fulvia , was the saddest that had yet risen upon Rome ; but its advent was made sure when I3rutus and Cassius drew their daggers on the fatal ides of March . While the old Senatorial party was thus doomed , it was long doubtful which of the competitors would be successful in grasping the prize that bad fallen from the grasp of the dying Ca*sar . The politic , persistent Octavius at last triumphed over the military experience and fitful energy of his rival , and was destined to found the Roman Empire . We have the materials , without relying too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded the Republic with that which Julius would have left behind him had he lived to finish the task he had but commenced . Certain unmistakable facts in the internal condition of the nation , and certain contrasts of personal character in the first and second C*sar , enable us to perceive the organic differences in the creations of their administrative faculty . Roman society , at the time when Octavius had overcome all opposition and had been invested with imperial powers , was greatly changed in many of its features from that which existed at the death of the Dictator . The first Emperor reached his height of power by a road marked with the slaughter of Rome 's best citizens . He had no confidence in the people ; he was timid and cautious in political expedieiits , only firm and vigorous in dealing with his enemies . The policy of the first C*sar was broader and wiser . He had spared all the aristocratic party who abandoned their open hostility and gave iu their submission , and had received many of them into his confidence . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been exerted , he trusted entirely to the power of ideas to thiish the revolution , He hoped to win the leaders of the old regime to his own views , or at least to secure their co-operation in carry- // Jan. ing out his plans , as the only means of promoting the best interests of the state , and aiding its progress towards unity . While destroying their exclusive power , he would not lose them as individual elements in the community , but would retain and use whatever of good they might contribute to the nation in the commencement of its new life . This body of men was sufficiently large , and the prestige of their name arid station was sufficiently treat , to have constituted them a strong conserving force in the fermenting mass of Roman society . Whatever of learning , of culture , of love for art and letters existed , was chiefly to be found in the ranks of the oligarchy . It was by no means true that their order as a whole was distinguished by these graces and amenities of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city prided themselves on retaining the roughness and severity of their fathers , and despised , or affected to despise , all the adventitious aids which had been borrowed from Grecian civilization . Others were entirely given up to debauchery , using their fortunes onJy as means of pandering to their baser appetites . But with all this stubborn clinging to the customs of their ancestors which was peculiar to some , and the profligacy which disgraced others , the wealth arid leisure of the class afforded opportunities of prosecuting those studies and engaging in those pursuits which cultivate breadth of thought , completeness of character- , and that refinement and delicacy of manner which the Romans called urbanity . A political reason far more important made these men necessary to the highest development of tire state . They were the representatives of much that had made Rome glorious through her past career . They carried with them the memories and sentiments of the illustrious dead whose exploits formed the national history , or were woven into the myths from which that history emerged . They were the link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that yet to come . They had indeed proved themselves unequal to the task of governimenit , and had been justly driven from power , but tlroir personal presence arid influence could not be spared in a society passing through a revolution so fundamental as that which closed the Republic and ushered in the Empire . C*sar would have retained a large admixture of this element , and its effect // upon the current of thought and opinion would have been felt through the whole extent and life of the Empire . No memories of general proscriptions and sweeping confiscations would have clung to the new-founded dynasty ; no gaps made by violent death would have reminded every influential family of the ordeal through which it had passed ; no patrimonial estate , enjoyed by some imperial favorite , would have been a constant suggestion to every ancient proprietor of the diminution made in his fortunes . The reality was far different . The classes which would have done so much towards elevating and refining the tone of society were swept away . The people , worn out by the commolions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were willing to accept any government which gave them peace . The habits of thought , the opinions and passions , which were the legitimate result of familiarity with scenes of slaughter and devastation , heightened as they were by the absence of that softening influence which a more generous culture would have added , stamped a character upon society which it never entirely shook off , and which thus proved how great an evil had been inflicted on the state by the substitution of Octavius for Julius as the first Roman Emperor . While C*sar would probably have pursued a policy in a measure conservative , and would have strengthened time foundations , and added grace to the superstructure , of the political fabric he was raising , by working into it choice material which was afterwards rejected , in some respects he was more radical than the actual founder of the Empire . Octavius was timid by nature , and his statesmanship bore the impress of his personal character . At the very outset of his public career , amid the general confusion and the conflict of interests which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one side , and the Senatorial faction on the other , as rivals who sought to crush him as an upstart , he had resolved to gather all power into his own hands ; but in the accomplishment of his design he proceeded by cautious and halting steps . Driven by the necessities of his position to consent to proscriptions which Julius had avoided , he yet lacked the nerve to announce his real purposes , and to expose his policy of reconstructin the // state . Even to the last he strove to cover up the fact of his absolute dominion under the semblance of institutions familiar to the days of the Republic . He shrunk from assuming the title of King , for that name was traditionally hateful . He was Imperator , in virtue of his command of the armies of the Coininonwealth . He cloaked his supreme civil authority under the guise of the consular and the tribunitian powers , and thus united in his own person those jurisdictions which belonged to the highest magistracies of the old constitution . The legislative function - that attribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emperor , elevating it immeasurably above all the monarchies of modern times , rendering it not merely in theory but in fact the single source of law and justice to a nation which the imperial writers fondly described as including the world - he never openly exercised . He retamed the Senate , ostentatiously submitting to them all matters of public welfare , and treating them as still the national legislature , although he contrived that their decrees should simply be the echoes of his own will . Under such a complete change of circumstances , he attempted to revive the habits of thought and to return to the customs of a former age . The old nobility , which had been swept away during the civil wars , and in whose extermination he had so materially assisted , was replaced by a new race of men suddenly elevated to dignity , whom he required to adopt the ideas and manners of the republican aristocracy . While he was in all things but the name an absolute monarch , he surrounded himself with many of the appearances of a liberal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , to whom he granted no political rights . That this policy was short-sighted , the subsequent history of the Empire demonstrates ; it served to give him present security , but only postponed the dangers which it could not remove . Through a protracted and fearful agony , a new birth had come to the state ; old things had passed away ; and these attempts to preserve or restore the cast-off institutions simply turned the current of national progress away from its direct course . It needed a ruler of a different intellectual and moral nature from Octavius to guide the forces which were then at work in consolidating the Roman Empire , so as to secure // the utmost freedom of development towards perfection . Augustus repressed and deadened the organic life of society and the individual life of the citizens ; Julius would have quickened and stimulated both . The Emperor produced a peace , but it was one of indifference and timidity , not of calm and strong repose . The Dictator would have aroused to action , and the energy of his creative genius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . Octavius had no confidence in his subjects , and was engrossed in expedients to strengthen his own dominion and secure the succession to his family ; C*sar would have been restrained by no fears of the people , or doubts of the permanency of his position . He would have accepted the lessons of the past , and , with the self-reliance of true greatness , would have carried out his measures of reorganization until the work was accomplished , and the new Commonwealth stood forth in the complete triumph of those ideas which had been struggling for supremacy through long centuries of conflict . The ancient institutions would have been abandoned , but the true Roman spirit would have been preserved and directed into new channels . The Eimpire was a necessity , resulting both from the internal condition of the state , and from the grand movements of Providence in unfolding the truth , hitherto unrecognized , of the universal brotherhood of mankind . The events in the history of the Commonwealth all pointed to this consummation . This was the period of transition from the ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of separate races , of citizens and barbarians , which had hitherto been universal , were to disappear in the wide-embracing fold of the Roman state ; and the Christian principle , working in a society specially prepared for its reception , was to produce its fruit in the belief of a common origiu and a common destiny for humanity . To the hastening of this glorious result , the Roman civilization , freed from the restraints of the Republic , was peculiarly adapted . Its ethnic life and energy were such that no nation could withstand it . All tribal forms , all institutions , all languages , brought between the poles of its ever-circling current , were disintegrated , resolved into their elements , and recombined in new proportionsoand with evemi stronger affini // ties . The Keltic races , which in Britain successfully resisted the moulding forces of Saxon culture , and even remain to the present day in sullen separation from their English neighbors , opposed no obstacle to the mastering influence of the Roman life in Gaul and Spain . So completely were they transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , when the hordes of barbarian invaders , the Visigoths , the Burgundians , the Franks , swept over them , they in turn communicated the living spirit of Rome to their new masters , until West&amp;rn and Southern Europe was once again recast in the imperial mould . He must be blind indeed , who does not see in this all-pervading vitality of a single people the preparation which Providence made for the spread of the Christian religion among those races which wore to give laws to the world .
