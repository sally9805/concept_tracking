ALL English historians agree that the most important transaction of the year 1696 , in the reign of William and Mary , was the attainder of Sir John Fenwick by the House of Commons . This gentleman , of the ancient family of that name so famous in border song and story , engaged actively in one of those ill-starred attempts by which James II . strove to recover the throne , and , upon the failure of the enterprise , was taken , tried , and condemned to execution . His younger brother , Colonel Thomas Fenwick , an officer of great distinction , who , differing from the other in politics , had adhered to the present monarch from the beginning , and served him in all his campaigns , after having vainly made the most strenuous exertions in behalf of Sir John , at length procured an audience of the King , and pleading his many services , begged at least a commutation of the sentence . The implacable monarch , however , turned a deaf ear to his entreaties , and told him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plea , that his loyalty might be better exercised than in behalf of traitor 's blond , even though it flowed in the veins of a kinsman . Stung by this taunt which seemed to fix the stain of his brother 's treason upon himself and all his race , and enraged at what he considered the ingratitude of the Sovereign , the colonel walked haughtily from the presence , and before he left the precincts of the court swore an oath publicly that from that time forth the soil of England should be alien to his feet . Naturally inflexible in his resolutions , and rendered especially so in this case by a sense of injury , he kept his oath with religious exactness , and his preparations were urged with such rapidity , that only a few weeks elapsed , after the unhappy end of his brother , before he set sail for the distant Province of Carolina , within the limits of which he possessed the grant of large , though wild and uncultivated estates . The colonel was enabled the more easily to carry into effect his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely unfettered by personal domestic relations . Entering the army early in life , at first solely as a relief to the penniless state of a younger son , habit had so developed in him a latent taste and genius for military matters , that his love of the mere business routine of hi* profession , and the zeal with which he pursued its glories and rewards , were able to divert into their channel whatever little inclination his rugged nature may have originally felt for those softer and more intimate pleasures which are derived from the exercise of the emotions in domestic life . The unexpected contingency of a // large fortune , which was left him by the will of a distant relative , found him so fixed in his attachment to his profession that it could produce no change in his life . When somewhat advanced in years , to the surprise of every one , he suddenly married the widow of a brother officer , a lady who possessed none of those charms , either of mind or person , which seemed necessary to determine to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general astonishment was entirely dissipated when it became known that he had received a large fortune by the marriage . In justice to the colonel , than whom no man ever entertained a finer disdain of mercenary motives , it should be stated that the consideration which actuated him , although much further removed from those which ordinarily govern men in these matters , was yet one which was much more creditable to the instincts of his nature . This meek , gentle creature , happening under his care once in the exigencies of a military life , was fascinated by the strong , resolute features of his character into a passion which she was so little able to conceal , and which , moreover , transported her to such depths of silent suffering , that the colonel actually married her , as he would have charged in a forlorn hope , from a sense of duty , quickened by a curious trace of pity , which not infrequently displayed itself amid the harshness of his nature . He was known afterward to say to his brother that fate had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not avoid her . If she was an incumbrance , she did not remain so long , for within two short years after the marriage , unhappy years for her-not that her husband ill-treated her , for he was of too noble , a strain to injure , at least , positively , any woman , but unhappy in that the wealth of affection , which she lavished upon him , received but the cold return which the demands of decency required-she languished andtdied , leaving to her husband a daughter , who received even less of his attention than the mother had before . Occupied continually in active military operations , the colonel placed the infant under the care of its maternal aunt , a widowed lady , who lived in a pleasant rural seclusion in the West Riding of Yorkshire , and from that time , during the ten years that had elapsed until the period at which they come under our notice , he had rarely seen her , and only at long intervals . Evelyn-she had received as a Christian name the surname of her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet fireside of her aunt , ignorant of any other home . She had only seen her father once since her mind had been sufficiently developed to comprehend the nature of the relationship between them , and her memory strong enough to retain any impression of his appearance . About four years before the times of which we are a1* present speaking , the colonel , happening to pass through the country with his brother on their way to the residence of the latter in the north of // England , had stopped for a day at the house of her aunt-actuated by some curiosity which it cost him but little divergence from his route to gratify  --  to see the child whom ordinarily he so completely ignored . The little girl preserved in her memory ever afterward a vivid recollection of the tall , gaunt , harsh-featured man who stared in her face with hard , gray eyes beneath shaggy brows , until she shrank away weeping , and hid her face on the bosom of her aunt . She remembered the quick , abrupt tones of his deep voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even the brilliance of his uniform , which had dazzled her childish eyes , tended to enhance the mysterious awe with which she regarded him ; and she mused often with strange , deep pride upon the singular deference which every one , even her uncle , paid to this great man who they told her was her father . She had never seen him since . They had heard of the unhappy fate which had befallen Sir John , and also that Colonel Fenwick was in England interceding for the life of his brother . These things had reached their ears by common report , and they were awaiting definite intelligence with the keenest expectation , when one day a coach arrived from London , bringing an agent who delivered to Mrs. Evelyn an autograph letter from Colonel Fenwick  --  the first she had ever received-in which he briefly gave information of the fate of Sir John , his own intention of leaving the country , and re* quested that Evelyn , whom he intended as the companion of his exit , should be sent to join him without delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the delays which the little girl and her aunt interposed with amiable deception , in two days after his arrival , Evelyn was dragged a way from the seclusion of the only home she had ever known , to enter upon the vicissitudes of that life beyond the great ocean , which was destined to end so tragically for her . To these circumstances is owing the acquisition to the Province of Carolina of one of its most honored races . It is to be regretted that we are left-in tracing the history of this family after reaching these shores  --  to the uncertain guidance of mere tradition , confirmed and illuminated by an occasional letter which has survived the chances of a century and a hali and a few scattered references of contemporary public history . Fortunately , on account of the wealth , fame and high social position of the persons concerned , as well as the ex*eedingly remarkable character of some of the incidents in their history , the local traditions are as clear , definite and reliable as it is possible for such records to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonel , notwithstanding the great demand then existing in the troubled state of the Province for his talents and experience , rigidly adhered to the seclusion of the most retired life , excepting in very few instances , the historical // references which remain are of the rarest and most meagre kind . He is mentioned among the commanders of the land forces during the invasion of the Spaniards , and as fighting on that occasion with his usual gallantry and success . Beside this it is not known that he ever partook in any public business except some negotiations with the chief of the neighboring Indians ; and to these he was impelled more by a spirit of curiosity to observe the manners of these savages , who always excited great interest in his mind , than by any desire , or even willingness , to enter into the affairs of the government . He built immediately upon his arrival a large and elegant mansion on the northwestern angle of John 's Island , at a short distance from the banks of the Stono River , just where that noble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ocean for miles , dividing the islands from the main , bends with easy sweep , and pursues its course to the sea . The steeples of Charleston lift themselves to the eye of one gazing from the roof of this house across the intervening marshes of Wappoo Creek , which , uniting with the Stono just at its head , connects on the other side , after a course of a few miles , with the waters of the Ashley , opposite the city . The walls of this mansion were built of bricks which were imported from England . Its style of construction is that of an English manor house , with a large , open hall at the entrance , upon which the doors of the apartments of the lower floor open , and from which the great oaken stairs ascend to the rooms of the upper story . The ceilings are surrounded by heavy wooden cornices , and the wainscoted walls are panelled with durable cypress , the . width of many of the single planks of which strike the beholder of the present day with astonishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a large wing attached to one hide , whi6h , with semi-octagonal gables , projects beyond the front and rear of the principal structure . This house , having escaped the chances of two great wars which have rendered the banks of the Stono historical , is standing to this day amid the few gigantic oaks that remain of all the magnificent grove , which may have in the first place attracted the notice of Colonel Fenwick , and determined his choice of the locality . In the Revolution it was the headquarters of the British General Prevost during the second attack upon Charleston . A memorial or the English occupation still remains in the shape of an old six-pounder cannon ball , half eaten by rust , which , lying now upon the lawn in company with several of the huge conical shot used in the recent war , seems to typify the difference between the two great struggles which the ancient mansion has witnessed . Enveloped in a green mantle of luxuriant ivy , curling gracefully even over the tops of the chimney stacks , and surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks the lapse of centuries , this house wears an air of antiquity entirely novel to our country , and it is undoubtedly one of the most interesting monuments of the past in the whole Union . At this period the furthest settlements from Charleston to the southward along the mainland just reached the Edisto River , and along the coast ; and John 's Island-itself only thinly peopled on the banks of the Stono-was the most southern portion of that fertile , and at present densely peopled , section known as the Sea Islands which had as yet been occupied by white settlers . Beyond this point to the southward , all the coast was in a state of original wilderness , covered with the almost tropical luxuriance of the native forests , through which roamed herds of deer , and in the secure shelter of whose dense covers the wild turkey reared her young . The waters of the innumerable streams which intersect this country , now so vexed by the , frequent oar of the boatman , the paddles of steamers , and the keels of sailing craft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in utter loneliness , save when the occasional canoe of the Indian hunter may have been seen in the distance threading stealthily the mazes of the channels amid the low marshes which lie along these rivers ; or , more rarely , the heavy yawl of the white explorer , forcing lazily its slow course over the wide bosom of the central stream . In such a country did Colonel Fenwick hide his wounded spirit , and in the most secluded privacy nursed his sense of that injury which had embittered his life . His household consisted of his little daughter , and a governess whom he had with some difficulty found willing to accompany her , two female servants and four men . He did not encourage , and scarcely returned , the attentions which his very few neighbors paid ; and they , after one or two vain attempts to excite some degree of reciprocity on his part , gradually desisted and left him to his loneliness . lIe found his , principal amusement and occupation in hunting . Much of his time , attention and means , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , and he is mentioned in the annals of the turf in Carolina as among the first patrons of the noble sport of racing , which . still continues the favorite amusement of the gentlemen of that State . This taste he had in common with his brother , the unhappy Sir John , who is recorded by Macaulay as , with the exception of the Duke of Newcastle , the greatest authority on the subject of horse-flesh in the kingdom of England . Vulgar report , always extravagant , tells to this day of the time when the large brick stables , still standing , were adorned with stalls the posts and mangers of which were of solid and elaborately carved mahogany ; and even this gross exaggeration tends to confirm what we know on better authority , that the colonel gave ' way to the most lavish expense in the indulgence // of this passion . The track which he laid off for the exercise of his horses , a straight stretch of three miles , is now incorporated into the system of the parish roads , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the life of Evelyn Fenwick during this period , we have still less information . It is easy , however , to imagine that , deprived of all congenial companionship , indeed , almost altogether of female society , and treated with carelessness by her father , she must have pined , from the wilderness in which her lot was cast , for the happy home and kind friend she loved so dearly in England . We can easily understand , too , how the absence of the moulding influences of society and the wild circumstances of her life must have tended to produce that self-reliant , brave , yet soft and feminine disposition , and that unconscious disregard of social artifices which excited so deep an interest toward her , when in after years she entered the world of men and women . She is first brought definitely to our knowledge by an exceedingly terrible incident which happened about four years after her arrival in America . But we must premise so far as to introduce another member of Colonel Fenwick 's household , who was destined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate and fortunes of this family , in which we find him a strange constituent . This was a young Indian , of eighteen years of age , named Ocketee , a son of a chief of the Yenasees . A little more than a year before this time , on the occasion of one of those councils held with the Indians , one or two of which , as we above stated , Colonel Fenwick attended , the father of this lad had expressed a desire that one of the white men should take his son into his household in order that he might learn the English language and become acquainted with the manners and habits of the English people . Sir Nathaniel Johnson , then Governor of the Province , was pleased with the idea of holding so important a hostage ; and Colonel Fenwick , delighted with the opportunity which would be thus afforded of studying the character of the red race , and of amusing himself by observation of the young savage , readily consented to comply with the wish of the Indian Chief . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of savages . lie was a tall stripling , whose lithe , slender limbs , not yet developed to the fhll vigor of manhood , were cast in the most elegant mould of nature . Although the term handsome can scarcely be applied to any of his race , yet his countenance possessed all of that dignity and loftiness of expression which high features are so adapted to bear ; and large , dark , splendid eyes , usually calm and observant , but easily kindling according to the movements of an impetuous spirit , lent a peculiar impressiveness to his face . Reticent after the usual nature of his kind , he rarely spoke ; but . when he 17 // did , it was in a voice of such astonishing compass , and such sweetness and richness of tone , that the ear of the listener was charmed by its music . In after years , when this young Indian had risen to the head of his powerful tribe , using with extraordinary bitterness against the whites the intelligence he had acquired in contact with them , he became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this State , and many a settler was doomed to hear his death knell sounded in the swelling war-whoop of that matchless voice . Upon his first arrival at Colonel Fenwick 's he seemed to regard himself in the light of a captive . Sullen and haughty , he crouched in one corner of the great hall with his arms crossed upon his knees , and regarded the novel scene before him with a calm , scrutinizing glance which betrayed nothing of timidity or even of surprise . He silently repelled all advances that were made , whether by word or sign , and with cold disdain refused the food which they persistently offered until one of the servants , more urgent than the rest , perceiving a wicked light kindling in his fierce black eyes , and an impatient contraction of the muscles of his face , shrank away alarmed , and no one ventured to solicit him further . Suddenly the calm gaze of the young Indian became fixed and eager , and with a quick movement he lifted his hitherto apathetic form from its recumbent position against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle of the floor , timidly yet curiously surveying the strange visitor . The English maiden seemed to exercise a mysterious spell over the wild son of the forest . Perhaps , unaccustomed as were his eyes to the beauty of the white race , a beauty heightened in the present case to him by the snowy garment which Evelyn wore , she may have seemed to his untutored mind a brighter realization of those lovely shapes which people that invisible world of which he had been taught in the wild superstitions of his fathers . Colonel Fenwick , perceiving the impression which the appearance of the little girl had made upon him , handed her the plate , and bade her persuade him to eat . Cautiously at first , and then more boldly as she saw his fierce glance softening before hers , the girl advanced until , kneeling immediately in his presence , she pressed upon him the food , which he took from her hand , and , as if mechanically , commenced to eat . From this time this influence , which , once established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only means by which they could control him . Haughty and intractable to others , resenting anything like undue familiarity with a fierceness which no one was willing to encounter a second time , he was yet as obedient and docile as a lamb to her , displaying in his demeanor a respect and adoration as profound as if she was a being of a higher sphere . From her lips he derived his first acquaintance with the English // tongue , with which he eventually became perfectly familiar ; while she in turn gathered from the beautiful enunciation of his musical voice an intimate knowledge of his native language . In all her walks he was her invariable attendant , following respectfully after her footsteps , and submitting with grave countenance to the girlish pranks to which in frolicsome humor she would subject him . It is pleasant to follow in fancy through these wild scenes , the rambles of this strangely consorted pair ; to listen to the glad laughter of the light-hearted English maiden ; and to watch the softer meaning glowing on the fierce countenance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Fenwick had purchased some negro slaves , who were now for the first time introduced into the Province . Among them was a gigantic negro , of hideously repulsive appearance , who proved so utterly intractable that no use could be made of him . The only effect of a resort to violent measures was to drive him into the woods , where he remained , committing so many depredations and acts of violence that he became a terror to the neighboring inhabitants . All efforts to capture him in the pathless coverts where he made his hiding places had hitherto proved fruitless , and had merely served to inflame still further a native wickedness of disposition , which rendered this ferocious savage capable of any act of desperate cruelty . One lovely afternoon in that delightful season of the year known as Indian Summer , which falls in this latitude about the middle of November , Evelyn , taking a small bag of grain in order to supply a bait which they were accustomed to set for wild turkeys , sallied forth from her father 's settlement along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was followed only by a large mastifl her usual attendant , the young Indian having been absent for a couple of days on a solitary hunting expedition . The wild instincts of the Indian race , which years of contact with civilization can scarcely subdue , found a vent in his case in these lonely rambles , which he prosecuted to such a distance that the prints of his feet might often have been seen in the sands of the low and densely wooded islands which lie immediately along the sea . On the present occasion he had been gone for two days , and as he ordinarily returned about the setting of the sun , Evelyn , after depositing the bait , resumed the path , from which she had departed a little for that purpose , and walked slowly forward in the direction in which she was in the habit of going to meet him . Afraid at length to venture further , especially as the sinking sun admonished her of the approaching night , she sat down on the smooth brown carpet which the fallen straw of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tree , surrendered herself to the deep charm of the quiet hour . The serenity of nature fell gradually with subduing effect upon the spirit of Evelyn , who was peculiarly subject to such influences , // and she lapsed unconsciously into the depths of revery . Suddenly her attention was excited by the mastiff , who arose from his recumbent position at her feet , gazing eagerly , with ears erect , and a low premonitory growl , at the heavy undergrowth which lay at a little distance along the right of the path , then went bounding forward , barking savagely as the bushes parted , and the gigantic negro , isSuing from the covert , advanced rapidly so as to interpose himself upon the track between her and home . The young girl started to her feet and gazed stupefied with terror upon the dreadful apparition before her . His great black body was without any covering excepting a pair of trowsers which were secured by a belt at the waist and hung in tatters below his knees . The coarse lips of his enormous mouth were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little eyes , red and bleared , gleamed wickedly below his sunken forehead , as he drew from a leathern scabbard at his waist a large knife , and awaited the attack of the mastiff . Recovered sufficiently from her momentary stupor to realize the horrors of her situation and to calculate the chances of escape , as soon as the dog sprang upon his antagonist Evelyn rushed by them *s they struggled , and sped onward , terror lending wings to her flight . Sue h an unequal struggle could be but of short duration , notwithstanding that the faithful brute did not release his hold until his head had been nearly severed from his body ; and a few moments after the cessation of the noise had warned Evelyn of the fate of the dog , she heard behind her , as she fled wildly , the heavy tread and deep panting of her savage pursuer . The next moment , calling vainly for help , she was dashed roughly to the earth by his hand . Placing his foot upon her body , he drew some cords from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly as to cause her excruciating pain , although neither by vain cries , nor still vainer entreaties , did she give any sign of the agonies she was enduring , or of her sense of the awful fate which had so suddenly overtaken her . But when her captor-who displayed the utmost haste in his movements , as if he feared some interference-threw her violently upon his shoulders , and started rapidly along the path , her despair burst forth in one wild scream , and then , overcome by terror , she sank into a state of insensibility . That last cry had reached a faithful ear . The negro had advanced but a few yards when the young Indian came in sight , running rapidly from the opposite direction . Immediately dropping his captive , the black sought safety in flight , but that fleet foot from which a deer could scarce escape soon . brought his pursuer upon him , and turning with dogged ferocity , he prepared for the conflict which he now saw was inevitable . A rare study would it have been for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // each other in the narrow glade of that ancient forest , while the yellow ray of the sun , just sinking , brought into full distinctness their forms and faces , so widely different , yet informed and animated by the spirit of one and the same terrible impulse . Even now the negro seemed anxious to avoid the conflict . He glanced uneasily from time to time behind him , and , although still facing his opponent with drawn knife , kept moving backward slowly with uncertain step . The eyes of the other were blazing with preternatural light ; his lithe , supple form quivering from head to foot with the passion that shook it ; his tomahawk grasped firmly at the extremity of the handle with both hands , vibrating from side to side in measure to his feet , as he advanced with quick , steady tread upon his antagonist ; the swell of his powerful voice , tremulous with excitement , waking the while the silence of the woods . Suddenly the negro rushed forward , evidently hoping by the rapidity of his motion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . But the keen eye of the Indian had marked the movement ; with a quick spring he eluded the grasp of the other , and at the same time dealt him a blow with his tomahawk which brought him to his knees . In a moment the brief combat was ended . A succession of blows , in pursuance of the advantage thus obtained , laid the huge form of the negro quivering in the agonies of death at the feet of his conqueror . A little while later when Evelyn , roused by the motion , recovered her senses , she found herself borne rapidly homeward in the arms of her protector , whose face had already returned to its usual stoical gravity of expression . The narrow escape of his daughter from a fate of untold horror seemed to awaken Colonel Fenwick to a sense of his injustice in hiding her in a wilderness , and depriving her early years of those advantages of society and education which were befitting her station in life .. He immediately determined upon sending her to England , and acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in executing a resolve that only a few weeks elapsed before she was once more on the ocean on her way to those friends who had been only the more endeared to her by absence . When she embarked for Charleston , the whole household , full of sorrow at parting from the young mistress whom they all loved , attended her to the landing place at the river . Apart from the rest , silent and haughty , stood the Indian . Evelyn , after bidding adieu to the others , stepped up to him , her face soft with the regret she felt at parting from her constant , faithful companion , her brave , loyal protector . She laid her light hand on his shoulder . " Kneel down , Ocketee . " Many a time had she bidden him kneel when in girlish frolic she would deck with garlands or with feather* the head of the stately // young chief . He knelt promptly in obedience to her request ; and her golden curls waved for a moment over his bronze , impassive features , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the spot after all the rest had left , following with steady glance the departing boat ; and when , as they were entering the mouth of the Wappoo , whose banks in another moment would hide them from sight , Evelyn turned to take a last look at the wild home she might never view again , she saw far over the waters the form of the young Indian , erect , immovable , against the brightness of the western sky . Very scanty memorials remain to us of the events of the next four years , and we must therefore be pardoned so much self-complaisance as to say that nothing occurred worthy of mention in our record . The colonel , growing continually more austere in his manners , spent his days in a closer devotion to the chase , and sat at night in grim loneliness before the blazing logs upon the great hearth of the hail . Shortly after Evelyn 's departure Ocketee returned to his people . He did not communicate his intention to any one , but went away quietly , as if for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several months afterward , when he one day made his appearance , bringing for the colonel a number of presents , after the fashion of the rude civility of his race . After this from time to time , sometimes at shorter , sometimes at longer intervals , he paid brief visits , just as unexpectedly appearing , and then disappearing . He was already risen to great importance in his tribe , and his manners had acquired a trace of authority , which , while it increased his communicativeness , added also to 1*iis excessive hauteur . At length , after four years absence , Evelyn returned . In fact , latterly many hints , timidly ventured in her letters to her father , had betrayed to that sagacious old observer that his daughter had learnt to feel that sort of interest in one of the other sex which , in accordance with his severe philosophy , he was accustomed to regard as not only a very foolish , but as a very criminal thing . He merely growled , however , to himself over these faint suggestions , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full explanation , a course , indeed , which that faint-hearted young female diplomat was very much in hope he would adopt . But at length there arrived a very penitent letter from the aunt of Evelyn , in which the whole story came out-told very timorously by this lady , who had a great dread of the colonel 's anger-that the young girl had betrothed herself to one Captain Gillis of the army ; and , added the writer , venturing an indirect plea in behalf of an arrangement , which , to tell the truth , she had furthered with much innocent artifice : " If the poor thing hath not her way in this , it will be cause // of great grief to her , I think , as she is affected with much regard to the young man , who , in truth , is as pleasing in spirit as he is comely in body . " Of this information the colonel took no further notice in the answer which he immediately dispatched than to order peremptorily Evelyn 's return . Colonel Fenwick seemed won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , now grown to womanhood . It may be that as age came creeping on he felt the want of some companionship ; it may be that the exceeding attractiveness of the young girl , and the quiet , unobtrusive affection which she displayed toward him , awakened at last in hi* breast the parental instinct which had so long lain dormant there ; certain it is , his manner toward her underwent a great change after her return from England , and week after week , as their intercourse extended , his regard seemed to grow greater and greater . In long walks and rides which they took together every day , and in conversations extended far into the night as they sat by the great fireside in the lonely hall , this father broke the seal of silence which had so long rested upon his lips , and narrated to his daughter in a grave , tender way the history of all the circumstances , and even of the secret thoughts and desires , of his entire life . He spoke to her for the first time of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew but little to say-and answered with commendable patience the numberless inquiries of the eager girl , who during her entire childhood had pondered deeply on the subject of this unknown parent . Yet in none of these confidential communications did he ever once allude to her engagement , and although often , when he seemed particularly kind in his manner , she had determined to unburden her heart to him , and to beg his favor upon a matter which *o deeply concerned her happiness , somehow she had never been able to overcome a dread of venturing upon the subject , and it still remained unspoken between them . It was not destined to remain so long . From the knowledge of the facts which we now possess it is certam that Captain Gills must have made his appearance in America about this time . It is rational to suppose that at parting with Evelyn he may have promised to follow her in order to beg her father 's consent to their union . And although we may regret our *gnorance of the particular events in the captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of recounting those crosses , on account of which immemorially , as the poet sings , the course of true love never did run smooth , we are , nevertheless , somewhat compensated by the positive certainty that persistence , as usual , had its reward in a favorable result , and that , not many months after Evelyn 's return , the young couple were united in the bonds of matrimony. // Some time before the marriage , Ocketee , arrayed in all the barbaric splendor of a chief of his race , made his appearance at the house . Evelyn , at first truly glad to see him again , soon felt a deep and constantly increasing annoyance at the manifest intensity of regard which he displayed toward her . She was , moreover , much alarmed at the fierce , inveterate hatred that he almost immediately conceived to Captain Gillis , a hatred which his wild , intractable nature sought so eagerly to gratify by wreaking vengeance on its object , whose high spirit in turn was so far from being loth to afford an opportunity , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young savage to keep the two from an encounter , which would have certainly had a fatal result . At length , after remaining about two weeks , to her great relief he went away , and never returned until some days after the marriage had taken place , when one of the servants reported having met him attended by several warriors in the woods in the vicinity . The servant reported having told him of the wedding , and of a great entertainment which the colonel intended giving on a certain day within a few weeks in honor of the event , He added that , after questioning him with regard to these matters , the Indian had gone away in another direction , followed by his band ; and as he did not come to the house that evening or the next day , they all concluded that he had returned to his tribe . The grand entertainment which Colonel Fenwick gave in celebration of the nuptials of his daughter created much excitement in the Province , and was the universal theme of conversation for weeks before its occurrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this was the first occasion on which that wealthy and distinguished gentleman had made a display of public hospitality , but also on account of the grandeur of the scale on which the preparations were conducted . Invitations were dispatched in every direction , and on the appointed day nearly all of the notabilities of the time , official and otherwise , with the Governor , Sir Nathaniel Johnson , at their h9ad , many of the principal gentlemen from every portion of the Province , and the chief part of its beauty and fashion , assembled around the splendid table at the head of which sat the graceful daughter of Colonel Fenwick . It matters not to attempt any picture of the brilliant scene which still lives , after the lapse of generations , in the traditions of men . The great hall , decorated with a profusion of the beautiful flowers which this happy clime affords , blazing with light , and resounding to delightful music , must have justified the many contemporary encomiums which are not yet forgotten . We can dwell but a moment with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the stately courtesy of that olden time , only a little less ephemeral than the colors which garnished or the strains which // lent delight to the scene , all long since passed away together , the men and the women , the flowers , and the music , into silence and darkness forever . Late at night , one of those thunder showers , so frequent in this latitude , arose , attended by a gale which blew for a while with considerable severity ; but the dance was at its height , and the giddy throng scarcely heeded the wildness and inclemency of nature without . An hour later , after the storm had subsided , one of the servants , happening to pass from the stables to the offices through the path which lies along the front of the house , came suddenly upon Ocketee , standing immovable as a statue behind an ornamental shrub near the building , and gazing ixitently into that window of the drawing-room , which , situated in the semi-octagonal gable of the wing , looks a long the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which the Indian only responded by waving him away with a haughty , impatient gesture ; and on reaching the servants ' hall , the presence of one to whose sudden comings and goings they were all accustomed had excited so little surprise in his mind that he did not think it worthy of mention . Within the window upon which the gaze of the Indian was nvetted stood Evelyn Fenwick , talking gayly , with a bridal vail twined amid her golden hair and flowing over her shoulders , flushed with happiness , radiant , beautifuL Captain Gillis was lingering near her , dressed in a brilliant uniform . Just then a servant approached him to say that his presence was requested in the dining-room at the other extremity of the house , in which , even at this late hour , some of the guests were loitering over the wine , He went out of the drawing-room , wended his way amid the dancers in the hall , and reached the dining-room , where , in response to the invitation of those who had sent for him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sipping it , stood upon the hearth with his back to the fire-place , and with a window looking out upon the front lawn upon his left hand . The revel was at its height , when suddenly a loud report of a gun in front of the building , followed by a wild , triumphant shout which rang through the halls , struck upon the startled ears of the company ; a pane in the window on the left of Captain Gillis came rattling in fragments to the floor ; the wine glass fell from his hand , and he sank prostrate on the hearth with the blood gushing in a stream from his mouth . A fearful scene of confusion ensued , every one supposing they were attacked by the Indians . The ladies ran screaming up stairs to the second story ; the gentlemen rushed in every direction for their arms ; while loud above the din was heard the voice of Colonel Fenwick giving the word of command in calm , clear tones . In a few moments this apprehension was dispelled , and they turned // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general alarm , no one had as yet approached . His features were found to be stark in death . He had been killed almost instantaneously by a bullet which , aimed with fatal accuracy , had struck him full in the heart . The rumor of his death , as soon as the panic had subsided , passed through the house , and crept up stairs where the ladies were still crouching in an agony of terror . All the gentlemen , excepting those who had gone out to reconnoitre the woods , had gathered about the body of the murdered man . Suddenly the door opened , and Evelyn stood upon the threshold , pale , trembling , gazing with eager , inquiring look . As the awful scene met her gaze , she sank to her knees upon the floor ; her eyes , turned to heaven as if mutely imploring in her agony , suddenly set , and lost their meaning , and with a low moan she fell forward , the heart 's blood of her husband actually bedabbling in hideous mockery her white garments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Evelyn never recovered from the tension of that awful shock . She sunk into gentle , silent idiocy , scanning with a pitiful , eager glance , the face of every new comer , and looking , for hours together , down the road in the direction of the river . The rest of her sad pilgrimage was not measured by many months . The visitor to this interesting spot can easily call up to his imagination that pale face , peering from the clustering ivy which surrounds the casements , for the coming of that form which , amid the wreck of her intellect , the faithful heart never forgot . Colonel Fenwick did not live many years after this event . Although he said nothing , it was evident that the blow had broken his iron nature ; and when he eventually lay dying , as long as his voice could articulate , he kept calling in low , sad tones upon the name of the daughter he had learned to love too late . Ocketee , as we have above stated , became famous for his implacable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeated passion , which had prompted him to such fearful vengeance , may have embittered his mind forever . A river in the lower part of Beaufort District , upon which his wigwam is said to have stood , is still known locally by his name . The stream is entitled the Colleton on the maps , in honor of Sir John Colleton ; but the popular voice , true to tradition , has left it associated from age to age with the terrible foe who once dwelt upon its banks ; and thus it has happened that the fame of the Indian chief has outlived the memory of the lordly proprietor .
