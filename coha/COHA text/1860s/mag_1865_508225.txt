SKETCHES OF SOCIAL LIFE IN CHINA. * BETROTHAL BETROTHAL in China is a matter with which the parties most deeply concerned have generally little to do . Their parents or guardians manage their betrothal much in the following manner : a person is employed as a go-between , or match-maker between the families . This person may be either a man or a woman . Usnally the go-between engaged by the family which first makes the proposal is employed by both families in subsequent negotiations . The negotiation is generally commenced by the family to which the boy or the young man belongs . The go-between is furnished with a card stating the ancestral name , and the eight characters which denote the hour , day , month , and year of birth of the candidate for matrimony . This card he takes to the family indicated , and tenders a proposal of marriage in re* gard to a daughter in behalf of a son of the party employing him .

If this fortune-teller pronounces favorably , and the two fami*ies agree in regard to the details of the marriage , a formal assent is made to the betrothment .

When it is deposited there , incense and candles are lighted before these tablets . The betrothal is not binding on the parties until a kind of pasteboard card has been interchanged between them . This card resembles somewhat a book-cover , consisting of two Rieces of pasteboard . One of these is made much like the cover of a pasteboard box , as far as its edges are concerned . The outside of it is covered with red paper . On this red paper is pasted the likenessof a dragon or a phmnix , according as it is designed for the boy or the girl , the dragon or 0* asuna Ann uaTn ' *eaooM TAKINO THEIN w*nnine mNaEa .

The small cakes are also distrihuted in a similar manner . The money sent is generally spent in outfitting the bride . Rich families make much more valuable presents than above indicated .

They add two jars of wine , on one of which is a picture of a dragon , and on the other a picture of the phoenix ; also a male and a female goat , ten or more pieces of silk , or satin , or crape , of five different kinds or colors . Presents of money are also sent for one of the bride 's maternal uncles , and for one of her paternal uncles , if she have such relatives living .

They accept all the money , and all the silks and satins designed for the use of the girl , but only the male of each pair of animals , one of the jars of wine , and a part of the large cakes of ceremony and the small cakes , and such a proportion of the other things as custom requires . The rest of the things , as the female animals , a few of the cakes , etc. , together with the card having the name of the bride 's family , are returned to the other party . The large cakes retnrned to the family of the groom are divided into four or eight pieces . One of these pieces is given to each family of near relatives or very intimate friends of the family of the groom , together with a little of the vermicelli , and one of the artificial flowers . This distribution of cakes among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relative or child of a dear friend is soon to be married . These families may expect to receive at the proper time a formal invitation to the wedding . A few days before the day fixed for the wedding the family of the hridegroom i*ain makes a present of various articles of food and other things to the family of the bride , as a cock and a hen , a leg and foot of a pig and of a goat , eight small cakes of bread , eight torches , three pairs of large red candles , a quantity of verniicdli , and several bunches of fire-crackers . There is also sent a girdle , a head-dress , a silken covering for the head and face , and several articles of ready-made clothing , which are usually borrowed or rented for the occasion . These are to be worn by the bride on her entering the bridal sedan to be carried to the home of her husband on the morning of her marriage . The food , or a part of it , including the cock , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire-crackers are for explosion on the road , and the torches are for burning during the time occupied en route to her new home . On each of the eight bread-cakes is made a large red character in an ancient form of writing , of an auspicious meaning , as " longevity , " " happiness , " " official emolument , " and " joy ; " or certain four of them have four characters , meaning " the phatnixes are singing in concert , " or " the ducks are seeking their mates . " Four of these bread-loaves are accepted ; the remaining four and the hen , according to strict custom , are returned to the party which proffers them . Some two or three days before the time fixed for the wedding a red card is sent by the family of the bride to the other party , stating what furniture will be furnished as the bride 's dowry , and the number of loads . The person who takes this card-usually the go-between-informs the family of the groom what time these things may be expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be that the fam*ily of the bridegroom may prepare and have in readiness the proper amount of money , duly put in red paper , or tied around by a red string , for the bearers of the furniture . Generally , on the afternoon or evening before the sending of the outfit , a very singular custom is observed by the bride , assisted by one or two women , who are employed to aid her for a few days before and subsequent to her marriage . This custom is called sfftiag foul . eyes , and is regarded as an omen of good . A large round sieve-like utensil , made out of bamboo splints , in diameter about three or four feet , is procured ; also a brass vessel , two or three feet in diameter and about one foot high , which is placed on a pedestal , raising it a short distance from the floor . After having placed in this vessel a quantity of burning coals they take the wedding garments one by one , or in convenient quantities , and having laid them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its contents , for a moment or two over the vessel , with a slight sifting movement . They then remove this portion of her clothing from the sieve , and , taking another portion , they place it on the sieve and go through the same ceremony , and so on , until all of her outfit , as regards personal clothing , shoes , and head ornaments , hasbeen properly sifted . Sometimes a similar ceremony is also performed with regard to the small articles of the household furniture which is designed for the brides s use in her future home . The holders of the sieve during the sifting are continually uttering various sentiments , which have come to be considered as peculiarly appropriate to the occasion and propitious , as , " a thousand eyes , ten thousand eyes we sift out ; gold and silver , wealth and precious things , we sift in . " After the articles have been sifted , contact with them is carefully avoided by the female memimbers of her family . It is supposed that it would be especially unlucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her class in society , and tries on the clothes she is to wear in the sedan and for a time after she arrives at her future home on the morrow , This is an occasion of great interest to her family . Her parents invite their female relatives and friends to a feast at their house . The professed object of trying on the clothing is to see how the articles provided will fit , and to ascertam that every thing is ready , so that there may be no delay or confusion on the arrival of BaIDAL SEDAN . // her featur*s from view . She is now led out of tier room by one of her female assistants , and takes her seat in the sedan , which has been brought into the reception-room of the house . The floor from her room to the sedan is covered for the occasion with a kind of red carpeting , so that her feet may not touch the ground . She takes her place in the sedan amidst the scmnd of fire-crackers and music by the band . The bride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , are required by custom to indulge during this morning in hearty and protracted crying-oftentimes , no doubt , sincere and unaffected . While seated in the sedan , but before she starts for her future home , her parents , or some members of her family , take a bed-quilt by its four corners , and , while holding it thus before the bridal chair , one of the bride 's assistants tosses into the air , one by one , four bread-cakes , in such a manner that they will fall into the bed-quilt . These bread-cakes were received from the family of her husband at the same time as the cock and vermicelli were received . The woman during this ceremony is constantly repeating felicitous sentences , which are assented to by some others of the company . The quilt containing these cakes is gathered up and cttrried immediately to an adjoining room . In the front of the procession go two men carrying two large lighted lanterns , having the ancestral or family name of the groom cut in a large form out of red paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lanterns , having the family name of the bride in a similar manner pasted on them . These belong to her family , and accompany her only a part of the way . Then comes a large red umbrella , followed by men carrying lighted torches , and by the band of music . Near the bridal chair are several brothers of the bride or friends of her family , and several friends or brothers of the groom . These latter are dispatched from the house of the groom early in the morning , for the purpose of meeting the bridal procession , and escorting the bride to her home . This deputation sometimes arrives at the house of the bride before she sets out on her journey , and , if so , it accompanies the procession all the way . About midway between the homes of the bride and the groom the procession stops in the street , while the important ceremony of receiving the bride is formally transacted . The friends of the bride stand near each other , and at a little distance stand the friends of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having the ancestral name of the bride 's family written on it ; the latter produce a similar card bearing the ancestral name of the groom . These they exchange , and each , seizing his own hands , bows toward the members of the other party . The two men in the front of the procession who carry the lanterns having the ancestral name of the groom now turn about , and , going between the sedan chair and the two men who carry the lanterns having the ancestral name of the bride , come back to their former position in the procession , having gone around the party which has thelanterns with the bride 's ancestral name attached . This latter party , while the other is thus encircling it , turns round in an opposite direction , and starts for the residence of the family of the bride , accompanied by that part of the escort which consisted of her brothers or the friends of her family . The*rest of the procession now proceeds on its way to the residence of the bridegroom , the band playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are exploded . It is said that , from the precise time when the two parties carrying lanterns having the ancestral names of the two families attached separate from each other in the street , the name of the bride is changed into the name of her betrothed ; the lanterns , having his name attached remaining in the procession , while those which have her ( former ) name are taken back to the residence of her father 's family . From this time during the day she generally is in the midst of entire personal strangers , excepting her female assistants , who accompany the procession , and keep with her wherever she goes . cm arriving at the door of the bridegroom 's house fire-crackers are let off in large quantities , and the band plays very vigorously . The torch-bearers , lantern-bearers , and the musicians stop near the door . The sedan is carried into the reception-room , and a sieve , such as was used in the ceremony of " sifting four eyes , " is put on the top of it , over its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sedan stops to the door of the bride 's room , is covered with red carpeting , lest her feet should touch the floor . A woman who has borne both male and female children , or , at least , male children , and who lives in harmonious subjection to her husband , approaches the door of the sedan , and utters various felicitous sentences . A boy six or eight years old , holding in his hands a brass mirror , with the reflecting surface turned from him and toward the chair , also comes near , and invites the bride to alight . At the same time the married woman who has uttered propitious words advances , as if to open the door of the sedan , when one of the female assistants of the bride , who accompanied the procession , steps forward and opens it . The mirror held by the lad is expected to ward off all deadly or pernicious influences which may emanate from the sedan . The bride is now aided by her female assistants to alight from the sedan . While being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was placed over the door of the bridal chair on its arrival is sometimes held over her head , and sometimes it is placed directly in front of the door of the sedan , so that , on stepping out , she will step into it . During all this time the features of the bride are entirely concealed by the thick covering put over her head by one of her parents at her parental residence . The groom , on the approach of the bridal procession , disappears from the crowd of friends // and relatives who have assembled at his residence on the happy o&amp;asion , and takes his position standing by the side of the bedstead , having his face turned toward the bed . When the bride enters the room , guided by her assistants , he turns around , and remains standing with his face turned from the bed . As soon as she has reached his side , both hridegroom and bride simultaneously seat themselves , side by side , on the edge of the bedstead . Oftentimes the groom manages to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he sits down by her , such a thing being considered as a kind of omen that she will be submissive . Sometimes the bride is very careful , by a proper adjustment of her clothing at the moment of sitting down , not only to prevent the accomplishment of such an intention on his part , but also to sit down , if possible , in such a manner that some of his dress will come under her ; thus manifesting her determination to preserve a proper independence , if not to bring him actually to yield obedience to her will . After sitting . thus in profound silence to5ether for a few moments , the groom arises and leaves the room . Before going out , the assistants of the bride oftentimes request him to rub the feet of his bride a little , under the impression that , if he should comply , her feet will be prevented by that act from aching in the future ! The ceremony , as a whole , is called " worshiping the temple . " A table is placed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be placed " before heaven . " Two candlesticks , containing two large lighted candles , arid a censer containing lighted incense , are put upon this table , the censer between the candlesticks . Among other things there are also placed on it two miniature white cocks , made of sugar , five kinds of dried fruit , a bundle of chopsticks , a foot measure , a mirror , a pair of shears , and a case containing money-scales . Some or all of these are frequently placed on a platter made out of the wood of the willow-tree . Two goblets , sometimes connected together by a red silk or red cotton cord several feet long , are also put upon the table . When every thing is ready , the bride is led out of her room and takes her place by the table on the right side of the groom . The faces of both parties are turned toward the table-that is , toward the open light of the heavens . At certain signals from one of the female assistants of the bride , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both parties kneel down four times , each time bowing their heads toward the earth once in profound silence . They then rise to their feet and change places , the bride standing on the left of the bridegroom . They now kneel down four times , bowing their heads as before . This portion of the ceremony is called " worshiping heaven and earth . " They then turn around , so that their faces am toward the inner or back side of the room , instead of toward the front or outside , as before , the bride being on the right side of her husband . The ancestral tablets having been previously placed on a table in the back side of the room , and candles and incense having been lighted and arranged near them in the customary way , the bridegroom and bride now bow down and worship these tablets eight times , according to the manner after which they have anina AND iuunao OOM woasurpiac TuE TABLETS OF BIS DECEASED ANCESTORS . // aaina Ann uRInEOuOOM niunaine sAnsue vOCETITEn. just " worshiped heaven and earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differing only in that they face each other , and not standing side hy side . Separated from each other by only a few feet , they now kneel down four times again , and bow their heads once each time toward the ground . After this they rise to their feet , and remain standing in silence , while they are helped to the wedding wine . One of the female assistants takes the two goblets from the table , and , having partially filled them with a mixture of wine and honey , she pours some of their contents from one into the other back and forth several times . She then holds one to the mouth of the groom , and the other to the mouth of the bri , who continue to face each other , and who then sip a little of the wine . She then changes the goblets , and the bride sips out ot the one just used hy the groom , and the groom sips out of the one just used by the bride , the goblets oftentimes remaining tied together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She then places the goblets on the table , and proceeds to break off a bit of the sugar cocks and give to the bridegroom and to the bride ; perhaps also a few of the five kinds of fruit which have been provided is handed to them . After this the groomusually takes the bunch of chopsticks in one hand and the long case which contains the money-scales in the other , and makes a pretense of raising up by their means the thick covering which conceals the head and face of his bride from his view . It is only a pretense , and he returns the chopsticks and the moneyscales to the place whence he took them . This usually concludes the ceremony . All of the articles of food and of family use pIeced on the table during the performance of this ceremony are , according to the Chinese stand-point , omens of harmony and of prosperity . Eating from the same sugar cock , and drinking wine from the same goblets , are synibolical of union in sharing their lot in life . Until this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , head-dress , etc. , which she had on when she entered heg sedan . These are now removed . She has her hair carefully combed in the style of her class in society , and she is arrayed in her own wedding garments . Sometimes her hair is gorgeously decked out with pearls and gems , true or false , according to the ability of the family to purchase , rent , or borrow . When her toilet has been completed , and every thing has been made ready , the bride and bridegroom sit down in her room to their wedding dinner . He now , oftentimes for the first time in his life , and always for the first time on his marriage-day , beholds the features of his wife . He may eat ever so much of the good things provided on the occasion , but she , according to established custom , may not take a particle . She must sit in silence , dignified and composed . The door being left open , the invited guests , and the parents of the groom and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observe her deportment . Several times during the day , if living conveniently near , the family of the bride send some refreshments V N N // for her to eat . This is received with thanks , and the bearer rewarded with a small present . Custom does not allow her to partake of this refreshment from her parents , but demands its being sent and received . Every invited guest is expected to make a present in money to the family of the bridegroom . This should be sent in to the family the day before the wedding , though sometimes it is brought by the guest himself when he comes to the feast . The amount of the present is entirely optional , and varies from a few hundred cash to fifteen or twenty dollars , according to the wealth of the gnest and the nearness of re . lationship . Even should the formal invitation not be complied with , the person invited remaining away , the present is nevertheless expected , and it wouh4 be disreputable not to give it . These presents in ready money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The large candles which were transferred to the bride 's room from the reception-room at the close of the ceremony of " worshiping heaven and earth , " are permitted to burn all day and unto the evening , if they will . As it is eminently desirable that candles should be burned all the night long in the bridal chamber , these are usually , during the evening , exchanged for another pair , which it is calculated will last until the following morning . These are two feet long , more or less , and of a bright red color . Usually on one is made , in a lively yellow color , a picture of a dragon , by the use of gold leaf , or of a liquid preparation called " gold oil ; " and on the other the picture of a phmnix , representing respectively the groom and his bride . Sometimes auspicious characters or phrases are written on the candles . These , lighted on the evening of the wedding , and arranged on the table in the bride 's room , are desired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer as they will last . It would be considered very unlucky should they be extinguished by accident . Should one or both of them go out during the night , such an event would indicate the p*emature and untimely death of one or both of the parties . The material of the candles should not melt and trickle down the sides . This is regarded as a bad omen , the trickling down of the material being thought to resemble the flowing of tears down the cheeks , and betokens , on wedding occasions , that there will be much sorrow in the family of the newly-married couple , or that they will not live happily together . If the candles should burn out about the same time , it is supposed that the couple will die about the same period in the future ; and should one burn much longer than the other , it is inferred that one will long survive the other . CEREMONIES AFTRR MARRIAGE . The wedding festivities generally last at least two days . The first day the male friends and relatives of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the occasion . On the second day the female friends and relatives of the family of the groom are invited to the wedding-feast . This is often called the women 's day. ** Not long after the family and guests have breakfasted on the morning of the second day , the newly-married couple , amidst the noise of fire-crackers , come out of their room together for the purpose of worshiping the ancestral tablets belonging to the household , the grandparents , and parents of the groom . This custom is known by the name of " coming out of the 7. *fl* ' Not long subsequent to the ceremony of " coming out of the room , " the couple proceed to the kitchen for the purpose of worshiping the god and goddess of the kitchen . This is performed with great decorum , and is regarded as an important and essential part of marriage solemnities . Incense and candles are lighted , and arranged on a table placed before the picture or the writing which represents these divinities , plastered upon the wall of the kitchen . Before this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by side , and bow in worship of the god and goddess of the kitchen . It is believed that they will thus propitiate their good-will , and especially that the bride , in attempting culinai* operations , will succeed better in consequence of paying early and respectful attentions to these divinities . On the third day the parents of the bride send an invitation to their son-in-law and his wife to visit them . With this invitation they send sedans for them . The card is usually brought by her brothers , if she has any of the proper age , or by relatives having her own ancestral name . Until this morning , since she left her former home , two days previous , the bride has seen none of her own family , and generally none of her own relatives or acquaintances . She and her husband now receive the congratulations and compliments of her brothers or other relatives , and prepare to visit her parents . The bride enters her sedan first , and proceeds a short distance in front of her husband . They do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive at the house of her parents at the same time . The chair provided for the bride on this occasion is a common black sedan in all respects , except that its screen in front has a certain charm painted upon the outside . This charm is the picture of a grim-looking man , sitting on a tiger , with one of his hands raised up , holding a sword , as if in the act of striking , representing a certain ruler of elves , hobgoblins , etc . TM object of its use on the occasion of a bride 's returning to her parents ' house , on the third day after her marriage , is to keep off evil and unpropitious influences from her . On arrival at her paternal home the bride 's sedan is carried into the reception-room , and she alight 's amidst the noise of fire-crackers . The sedan which contains the son-in-law stops a few rods from his father-in-law 's residence , where he is met by one of his brothers-in-law , or some relative or friend , deputed to meet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . conduct him into the house . The two parties , standing in the street , respectfully shake their own hands toward each other on meeting , according to the approved fashion . The newly arrived is now invited to cuter the house . He is seated in the reception-room , where he is treated successively to three cups of tea and three pipes of tobacco . Afterward he is invited to go and see his mother-in-law in her room , where he finds his wife . There he sits a while , and visits after a stereotyped manner , being careful to use only good or propitious words , avoiding every subject and phrase which , according to the notions of this people , are unlucky . He is soon invited into the receptionroom , where he is joined hy his wife . Every thing heing arranged , the husband and wife proceed to worship the ancestral tahiets of her family , her grandparents , and her parents , if living and present , very much in the way they worshiped , on the preceding day , the tablets of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion of this ceremony the bride retires to her mother 's apartments , *r to some hack room , where she and the female relatives present are feasted . Her husband is invited to partake of some refreshments in the reception-room , in doing which he is joined hy his bride 's brothers , or some others of her family relatives . According to the rules of etiquette he must eat but very little , however hungry he may he . The usual phrase employed in speaking of it is that , he eats part of " three bowls of vegetables , " after which he declines to receive any thing more , under the plea that he has eaten enough . He soon takes his departure in his sedan , leaving his bride to follow by herself by-and-by , accompanied usually only by a servant or female friend . It is a common custom , on the morning of the tenth day after her marriage , for the parents of the bride to send an invitation for her to spend the day with them . If accepted , she goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a month , should they again invite her , she usually goes and visits with her parents , and brothers and sisters , for a few consecutive days , spending the nights there . Her husband calls upon them during this visit perhaps once or twice in the daytime , but is careful neither to go there with his wife n* return home with her . Husbands are never seen with their wives in public . At the expiration of a month after marriage the bride expccts to receive a present from her parents , consisting , in part , of the following articles : an image of the Goddess of Mercy , universally worshiped by married women , and a portable niche to put it in ; a censer to contain incense while consuming ; a pair of candlesticks , to hold candles while she is worshiping ; a fan ; two flower vases ; artificial flowers ; and cosmetics . After the first year of his marriage the bridegroom is expected every year to make presents . of a pig 's foot , vermicelli , xvine , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to his father and mother-in-law , on the occurrences of their birthdays , at the festivals which take place during the fifth month , the eighth month , and at the winter solstice , and at new year 's . During the first year of his married life it is customary for his parents-in-law to make him more or less presents like the above , at the times of the great festivals , and especially at new year 's day . CEREMONIES WITH CHILDREN . On the third day after the birth of a child the midwife washes it for the first time . This washing is performed before an image of the Goddess of Children , already referred to , called Mother . This divinity is supposed to have the care and oversight of children of both sexes until they are sixteen years old . About the time of washing the child an oblation of five or eight plates of meats , fruits , etc. , is made to the goddess , arranged on a table before her picture or image , with wine , incense , candles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thank-offeitug for the aid of " Mother " thus far . The food is subsequently taken away and eaten by the members of the family . On this day friends and relations take occasion to send various kinds of food , as fowls , vermicelli , and cakes , to the family , in token of their congratulations . Imlnediately after being washed , the important custom of binding its wrists is observed . In regard to this there seems io be great diversity of practice . Some families simply bind around each wrist one or more ancient cask of a particular kind by means of a red cotton cord , where the cash remains for eleven days or longer . Others only put around each wrist a loose red string , as though it were a ring . Other families provide several silver toys , as a miniature seal , a small bell , drum , pestle , and mallet . One or more of each kind of these toys , with an ancient cash , are bound around each wrist . The string used is generally about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists , leaving into the bedroom for the space of eleven days , about one foot of loose string between them . while the parcel remains on the door , who ought These things are worn till the child is fourteen not to come into it , the child will assuredly have days old , when some families remove them , white sores on its gums , and that it will be sickSometimes , however , a ring of red cord or of ly and difficult to rear . red tape , with or without some cash or toy , is worn for several months , or even for a year . When soiled , the tape or cord is exchanged for another clean one . I The ancient cash is used as a charm , in order to keep away evil spirits or influences . The silver toys are designed as omens of good relating to the future life of the child , as it were expressing the desire that it may become wealthy and honored . The wrists are thus tied together in order to prevent the child becoming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tying of the wrists will tend to keep the child from being troublesome in after-life , and from meddling with whht does not belong to it , just as though he or she was bound . When boys and girls are naughty and troublesome , they are oft- qwq been previously presented before tbe ancestral table . tablets of the family , where incense and candles are already burning . On this are laid a set of money-scales , a pair of shears , a foot-measure , a brass mirror , pencil , ink , paper , and ink-slab , one or two books , the abacus , a silver or a gold ornament or implemel ) t , and fruits , etc . Tbe child , dressed in the new garments just presented , is placed upon the sieve in the midst of the articles upon it . The object now is to see what it will first take hold of and play with . The moment is one of great interest to the parents and assembled friends . It is said that the article or articles the child first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition in the world . If the child be a boy , and he takes a hook or an implement connected with literature , as pen or ink , it is surmised that he It is not usual to allow a child to sit in a chair until the day it is four months old . At a suitable time during this day the soft molasses candy provided by its maternal grandmother is taken , and put in the seat of the chair on rollers . The child is then put in the chair so as to sit down on this candy , which sticks it tothe chair for the time being .

The ceremony of passing through the door " sustains a very important relation to the welfare of children , according to the sentiment and practice of many Chinese . Some families have it performed regularly every year ; others every second year , as in the first and third ; others every third year , as the third and sixth , and so on , until the child is sixteen years old , or the ceremony of " going out of childhood " is observed . Sometimes , when a child is sickly , " the door is passed through " once or twice per month , or several times in th' course of the year , according to the condition of the child and the will and ability of the parents . Probably there are few families here which do not have this ceremony performed more or less frequently between the third day after the birth of a child and the period when it is supposed to pass out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is performed in consequence of the decision of a fortune-teller for the benefit of a child . A day is usually spent in " passing through the door " and its attendant ceremonies . Several priests of the Tauist sect ( never any of the Buddhist sect ) come to the residence of the lad 's parents in the morning , before or after breakfast , according to agreement , and first arrange an altar , made out of tables placed one upon another . On the uppermost of the tables they place censers , candlesticks , and various images of their gods . Behind the altar they suspend three paper - hangings , upon which are painted several tens of goddesses , among whom that of " Mother " occupies a conspicuous position . In a convenient part of the room is placed a table , having upon it five , eight , or ten plates of meats , vegetahles , fruits , and cakes . After every thing is properly arranged one of the priests rings a bell while chanting his formulas , another beats a drum , another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this is to invite certain goddesses to be present , which is supposed to be done when their names and places of residence have been repeated in the accustomed manner . The celebrated female divinities who are honored as midwives or " mothers , " and who are believed to be particularly concerned in the rearing of children , or who originally lived in the surrounding country , are invited to be present . At the proper time , usually in the afternoon , these goddesses are invited to partake of a feast , which has been arranged on a table for their entertainment . Besides eight or ten kinds of food , there are also provided a wash-bowl of hot water , and a towel , a fan , and cosmetics and artificial flowers for the especial use of the female divinities in making their toilet before partaking of the feast . The priests ring a hell , beat a drum , and clap their cymbals , reciting their liturgies for an indefinite time , which constitutes an invitation for these goddesses to partake of the collation . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the afternoon or near sundown . This door is made out of bamboo , covered with red and white paper , and is some seven feet high by two and a half or three feet wide , costing perr*sssae Tunocen TILE noos. // haps twelve or fifteen cents . The furniture in the room is so arranged that the priests and the party which passes through this door can go around without doubling on their track . Sometimes a table is placed near the centre of the room , and an open space is left on all sides of it . One of the priests-who wears a fancycolored skirt , and has on his head a curiouslyshaped head-dress-takes in one hand a small hell , or a sword having small bells fastened to the handle , and in the other a horn , and commences reciting formulas or incantations in front of this door , which is often at this time standing near the centre of the room . The priest , thus dressed , personates " Mother " in the act of performing magic spells for the purpose of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paterfamilias , or , if absent or deceased , some one in his stead , calls the children of the family together . He takes the one which can not walk or which is sick in his arms , and the other children , if any , each take a single stick of lighted incense in their hands . The priest after a while blows his horn , and advances slowly through the door . He is followed by the paterfamilias or his representative , and all the children of the family , who thus pass through the door . All the other priests are at this time doing something to aid , as beating the drum and clapping their cymbals . The head priest brandishes the sword in the air , or in its place he sometimes flourishes a whip made in the shape of a snake , as though he was striking an invisible object . The door is then taken and placed at one of the four corners of the room , and the priest , father , and children again pass through it in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the other corners , and again in the centre , where it is respectively passed through by the priest and his followers . Soon after this the door is hacked in pieces , and its parts set on fire and burned in the open court of the house , or in the street in front of the house where the ceremony is performed . While performing this ceremony a small wooden image , a foot high , more or less , is invariably used to represent the child for whose special benefit it is celebrated . When first performed for any child , a new one is obtained to represent it ; and when not used , it is carefully preserved . Oftentimes it is placed by the side of " Mother 's " image in the bedroom . The name of the child is usually written on the back of the image . In case the child dies before sixteen years of age , this image is placed in the coffin with its corpse , and buried with it . After the ceremony of " going out of childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaything by the children of the family . In case the child is exceedingly sick , and may not be carried in person through the door , this image , with or without some of the clothing of the child placed on a platter , is taken and carried through the door , instead of the child , which amounts to the same thing as though the child itself was carried VOL . XXXI. - No. 184. -G * through . As above intimated , all the children of the family improve the opportunity to pass through the door , as well as the particular one for whose special benefit the ceremony is observed . Sometimes nephews and nieces , and several of the children of the near relatives of the family who happen to be present , also join the procession and pass through the door . The design of all this is to benefit the children , cau.sing them to recover if sick or feeble , continuing them in health if well , and enabling them to arrive at a good old age . Many parents , after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one month old , allow the hair to grow on a part of the top of the head , if a boy , in the shape and of the size of a small peach , nntil eight or ten years old , or even until sixteen years old ; if a girl , a patch of hair is often allowed to grow on one or both sides of the head . Many Chinese seem to he at a loss why the tuft is left . Some explain that which is left on the pate of a boy to be for a defense.of the soft part of the skull . They all seem to regard it as an omen of good , or a kind of charm , and conducive to the health or welfare of the child . Sometimes neither the " peach " nor the queue is allowed to grow until the lad is some six or eight years old , the whole head being regularly shaven . The cause of this delay is sometimes said to be the death of his father or mother when it was decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case of him who is the only son of his parents , and born long after their marriage , they vow to give him up to be the child of some idol or to be a Buddhist priest . They will not then let his hair grow on his pate until six or eight years old . Their object in making this vow , and in treating their dearlybeloved son in this way , is to procure good health and longevity to the lad . They apply various sorts of derogatory names or epithets to him , as " Buddhist priest , " " beggar , " " refuse , " " dirt , " imagining that he will thus be allowed to live , and that no evil spirit or influence will injure his health . By-and-by , when he seems to be established in health , they allow his hair to grow like other boys . All their apparent neglect and abuse are but an index of their real affection for him , and are intended to lead the evil spirits and malicious influences , which might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass him by as worthless and good for nothing . PARENTS AND ChILDREN . The ceremony called " going out of childhood " is performed by many families when each of their children is sixteen years old or thereabouts . It is very nearly like the ceremony called " passing through the door , " which has been described , except that it is generally much more imposing and showy than that ceremony , as it is usually performed . The theory enter* tamed is , that at sixteen years of age the boy emerges from boyhood into manhood , and the girl from girlhood into womanhood . From th' // time of the performance of this ceremony the goddess of children , " Mother , " ceases to have the superintendence of the boy or the girl , and the individual comes under the government of the gods in general . The expression " thanking Mother " is often used in speaking of this event , when she is thanked for her past care of the youth . Let it not be understood , because one becomes of age or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he comes out from the legal control of his parents at this time . While his parents are alive , a son must continue to obey them . Such is the doctrine of the classics , the laws , and the customs of China . No matter how old , how educated , how wealthy-except he has become an officer of the government , and while he is serving the emperor-he must render prompt and implicit obedience to his father and mother . He may on no account disobey , or neglect , or slight their wishes or their orders . After he has become an official , and is a ny from his paternal home in the service of the state , lie is subject to the commands of the emperor .. his parents can not then control him in any respect , though he must conform in every thing to the established customs of the empire in regard to his parents . Th* time never arrives when a man in a private station , while his parents are living , may cnga*e in the pursuit he chooses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend them as he pleases , without their free consent and approval . His wages are given to them , and they can oblige him to do any thing or take any course they please , without asking his consent or caring for his preferences . Such is said to be law ; but infect and iii practice he is treated with some consideration , often consulted , and his wishes frequently complied with . A daughter , after she is married , is net subject to her own parents , but comes under the control of her husband 's parents , if they are living . To them she is often little different from a slave . She may not resist , or oppose , or deride their wishes or commands , any more than she might resist , or oppose , or deride the wishes or commands of her own parents before her marriage . Very frequently she is treated by them with great cruelty . After the son has attained his sixteenth year , in case of the dece* se of his father , he generally manages the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless his mother should happen to be a strong - minded woman . The classic says the woman has three obeyings : 1st , s/ic must obey her father ( before her marriage ) ; 2d , she must obey her husband ( after marriage ) ; and , 3d , s/ic must obey her son ( after her husband 's death ) , i. e. , when he shall have arrived at mature age . The principle of a woman 's obeying her son after the decease of her husband must not be un derstood as allowing him to abuse , or insult , or injure her . Neither would custom tolerate nor the laws justify such unfilial conduct . In cases of extreme unfilial conduct parents sometimes accuse their children before the magistrate , and demand his official aid in controlling or punishing them ; but such instances are comparatively rare . Public sentiment is so strong against the individual who will not treat his parents with the customary respect and obedience , and the want of filial piety is taught to be a erhue of such enormity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lay themselves open to the disgrace of a public prosecution . It is said that , should a parent whip . his child to death for unfilial conduct , notice would seldom or never be taken of it in the shape of a prosecution of the parent before the magistrate ; only the maternal uncles of the disobedient lad or man would have a right to interfere in the case . When a parent brings his incorrigible son before the magistrate for filial impiety , and demands punishment to be inflicted , the maternal uncles of the accused have a right to interfere or to he consulted , especially in case very severe punishmeat , as death , should be demanded by the indignant and dishonored parent . The magistrate may exercise his prerogative of advising the p. rent in regard to the course to be pursued , as well as of exhorting the refractory son in regard to his duty ; but lie may not set himself firmly against carrying out the punishment demanded by the offended parent . If the parent requires his son to be publicly whipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged to order the infliction of the whipping . If the former demands a public exposure of his son in the wooden cangue , with the crime of not filial written upon it , then the latter must cause the son to be thus punished for a specified time . If , after these or similar slight punishments , the son remains undutiful and disobedient , and his parents demand it at the hands of the mugistrate , the latter must , with the consent of the maternal uncles of the individual , cause him to be taken out to the high wall in front of the yamun , and have him there publicly whipped to death . If a son should murder his parent , either fa* thur or mother , and be convicted of the crime , he would not only be beheaded , but his body would be mutilated bybeing cut into small pieces ; his house would be razed to the ground , and the earth under it would be dug up for several feet deep ; his neighbors living on the right and the left would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punishment ; the district magistrate of the place would be deprived of his office and disgraced ; the prefect , the governor of the province , and the viceroy would all be degraded three degrees in ratmk . All this is done and suffered to mark the enormity of the crime of a parricide.
