Persons .  --  Donna Viola , and Gabriel , a young priest . Main text Gabriel . Gabriel  --  God 's blessing be upon thee , noble lady . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  I thank you , reverend sir . Behold , in me One to the Church a stranger ; all unused To forms , and canons , and all holy things . In brief , I have no faith ! But , sick of soul , I longed to ask thee , can thine office help me ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  He whom I serve hath help for all , my lady . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Forgive , then , my unsaintly mien and speech , And forget thine ordained authority . I know not , care not aught for solemn pomp ; As man with woman , hear and speak with me . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Lady , I am but man , as thou art woman . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Then , canst thou feel for me ? Hast thou a heart ? Did ever passion set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a heart ; but never yet loved woman , Save with affection and pure charity . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  A man , yet ne'er hast loved ! Pray , look on me ; I fain would read some meaning in those eyes . Canst thou not love ? Come , take this hand in thine ; Is it not gentle ? Touching his clasped hands . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Pardon me , noble lady . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Are priests forbidden to be courteous ? Take it , clasp it ; there 's no infection in it . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Pardon me , lady ! O , too tempting madness ! Aside . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Thou art as cold as marble . Why ? Those eyes Are beautiful ; that cheek hath a young glow , Thriving ' mid penance , like a rose in winter ; I can not think thee but a heartless statue ! Look upon me ; Flatterers have called me beauteous ; think'st thou so ? There is a ruddy ripeness in my cheek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redder glow ; And I am light of form , and quick in step ; Bird-like when joyous , tenderest when saddened ; In all things warm , impulsive , passionate . Yet , did I proffer thee my virgin love , Called thee my own , caressed thee , cherished thee ; Told thee " Sweet Gabriel , I am thine alone ! " Yet wouldst thou stand off from these opened arms , Gabriel ! And leave them empty ! wouldst thou not ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Ay , would I , lady ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Then thou art heartless , truly ! Gabriel . Gabriel  --  O , no , no , no ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  They tell me of a canon Making all love forbidden fruit to you . But can such be divine ? No , never , never Nature is eloquent to plead its wrong ; Wherefore should man thus war against all nature ? I tell thee , hoary ages can not plant Respect upon the brows of such gross error . But , man , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabriel  --  Lady , I have ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  A heart that holds no passion ! Gabriel . Gabriel  --  My passions are as warm and strong as thine ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Then wherefore now so calm ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Ris ing from his seat . O , help me , heaven . Aside . Calm , didst thou say ? Yes , the great heavens are calm , That give forth thunders with a moment 's warning ; And the volcano 's crater  --  it is calm Ere it bursts forth , as though all hell were wakened ; I , too , am calm ; but , in this heart 's volcano , Passions are sleeping , deeper than tragedy ; Stronger than death ; more fearful than the grave ; Which , were they not locked fast by love of heaven , Would make thee tremble with their lightest whisper . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Fair sir , forgive me ; reverend sir , I wronged you . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Daughter , thou wrong'st me not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thee my humble counsel ; If thou dost need none , duty calls me hence . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  I do , I do ; my mind is dark and blind ! Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Knowest thou not the teachings of our faith ? Donna V. Donna Viola  --  I know not what faith is . The very babe , Schooled to its cradle-prayers , knows more than I. Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Knowest thou then thine own heart ? Donna V. Donna Viola  --  I never conned it . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Then , let me paint it to thee . It is evil ; Full of wrong thoughts and evil impulses ; Each lightning impulse mad to spring in action . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  How dost thou know me so ? I did not tell thee ! Gabriel . Gabriel  --  ' T is but the story of each human soul . Alas , I know it well ; ' t is mine ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Hast thou , too , erred ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Lady , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of things that creep and swim , So full my heart is of corruption ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  What can I hope then ? If the best are so , What room in heaven for me ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  ' T is not by merit ; But , by God 's mercy , best and worst are equal , If all but will receive it . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  That is wondrous . Thou hast put thoughts into my inmost soul That stir it , as leviathans the deep . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Rather , dear lady , may they prove as angels , Moving it like Bethesda ; whence may come Healing , and life , and hope ! Donna V. Donna Viola  --  So may it be . I fain would ponder o'er what thou hast said . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Take , then , this scroll with thee , and con it well . The whole world were not worth it , read aright . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Most strange , I thought not on these things before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , battling heart ! This sacrifice is sealed ; Though it was hard to offer ! Now first waked My heart from its dull dream of apathy ; First learned that it could feel , and leap , and throb , In passion 's agony , or passion 's joy . Now , in the vista of bright , possible things , Shone love , an earthly heaven  --  still stretching on , O'erleaping death , even to eternal bliss ! Yet this , hope 's paradise , I must abandon ; Shutting my soul up , like this gloomy cell , Against the very light and breath of joy . Then , be it so . Father , Thy will be done ! Yet , pardon , if some natural regrets , Some tearful dallying with soon parted hopes , Make this day 's prayers less calm ! Re-enter Donna Viola . Daughter , thy brow is sad . Is ' t ever thus ? Donna V. Donna Viola  --  No , I am wild of spirit as the wind ; And , often , blithe as the brook 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'er my thoughts , Though sad , yet sweet ; I would not , now , be merry . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Ever more peace with sadness dwells , than mirth . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  O , I have heard , in my heart 's silent halls , Echoes as solemn-sweet as vesper-bells ; Voices that sound as though from heaven they fell ; And all do question me  --  " O , wild , wild heart , Why shake not off these foes that wreck thy peace ? " Think'st thou a curse is resting on me , father ? Else why , as though by angel ministry , Such gentle and yet fearful warnings come ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Daughter , our whole race writhes beneath the curse Which the arch-enemy wrought long ago . He and his fiends conspire against us ; yet They can but offer curses for our choice , To barter blessings with , if such we will . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Needs it our will , then ? Gabriel . Gabriel Aye . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slay my soul . But , is there hope for me ? Pray , tell me , father , This mesh of hell , can it be torn and scattered ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  One , only , hath the power this to ordain , And , by His instruments , to work thy rescue . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Who , who ? Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Thy God . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  Him have I never known ! Gabriel . Gabriel  --  Yet hath He known thee ,  --  aye , and loved thee , too ! Lady , where slept thine eyes , thine ears , thy heart , That , in all marvellous things of earth and heaven , Thou ne'er didst see , hear , feel , and taste of God ? In all things terrible , His might is shown ; Through all things vast , shines His infinity ; Yet , is it joy , where beauty moves and dwells , To read the tale of His eternal Love ! In loveliness of the sweet , silent flowers , Or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars amid the blue . And , still more deeply , have I learned of Him , In His own chosen temple of the soul . Donna V. Donna Viola  --  These words , I know , are true ; deep , deep within me , Unheard before , an echo answers them , Yet what am I to do , or speak , or think ? How learn to love , obey and worship . Tell me . Gabriel . Gabriel  --  All this , and more , ' twill be my joy to answer , When a more fitting leisure waits upon us . Till then , to thine own thoughts let me commend thee ,  --  And to thy prayers ; mine join with them . Farewell .
