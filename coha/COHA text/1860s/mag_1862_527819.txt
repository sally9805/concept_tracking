txt CHIEFLY ABOUT WAR-MATTERS . BY A PEACEABLE MAN . THERE is no remoteness of life and thought , no hermetically sealed seclusion , except , possibly , that of the grave , into which the disturbing influences of this war do riot penetrate . Of course , the general heart-quake of the country long ago knocked at my cottage-door , and compelled me , reluctantly , to suspend the contemplation of certain fantasies , to which , according to my harmless custom , I was endeavoring to give a sufficiently life-like aspect to admit of their figuring in a romaiice . As I make no pretensions to state-craft or soldiership , and could promote the common weal neither by valor nor counsel , it seemed , at first , a pity that I should be debarred from such unsubstantial business as I had contrived for inyselg since nothing more genuine was to he substituted for it . But I magnanimously considered that there is a kind of treason in insulating one 's self from the universal fear and sorrow , and thinking one 's idle thoughts in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man be so cold and hard-heartdd , he would better deserve to be sent to Fort Warren than many who have found their way thither on the score of violent , but misdirected sympathies . I remembered the touching rebuke administered by King Charles to that rural squire the echo of whose hunting-horn came to the poor monarch 's ear on the morning before a hattie , where the sovereignty and constitution of England were to be set at stake . So I gave myself up to reading , newspapers and listening to the click of the telegraph , like other people ; until , after a great many months of such pastime , it grew so aboininably irksome that I determined to look a little more closely at matters with my own eyes . Accordingly we set out - a friend and myself- towards Washington , while it was still the long , dreary January of our Northern year , though March in name nor were we unwilling to clip a little margin off the five months ' winter , during which there is nothing genial in New England save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we started The sun shone brightly on snow-covered hills in the neighborhood of Boston , and bur // nished the surface of frozen ponds ; and the wintry weather kept along with us while we trundled through Worcester and Springfield , and all those old , familiar towns , and through the village-cities of Connecticut . In New York the streets were afloat with liquid mud and slosh . Over New Jersey there was still a thin coverin* of snow , with the face of Nature visible through the rents in her white shroud , though with little or no symptom of reviving life . But when we reached Philadelphia , the air was mild and balmy ; there was but a patch or two of dingy winter here and there , and the hare , brown fields about the city were ready to be green . We had met the Spring half-way , in her slow progress from the South ; and if we kept onward at the same pace , and could get through the Rebel lines , we should soon come to fresh grass , fruit-blossoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of early summer . On our way , we heard many rumors of the war , but saw few signs of it . The people were staid and decorous , according to their ordinary fashion ; and business seemed about as brisk as usual ,  - -  though , I suppose , it was considerably diverted from its customary channels into warlike ones . In the cities , especially in New York , there was a rather prominent display of military goods at the shopwindows , - such as swords with gilded scabbards and trappings , epaulets , carahines , revolvers , and sometimes a great iron cannon at the edge of the pavement , as if Mars had dropped one of his pocketpistols there , while hurrying to the field . As railway-companions , we had now and then a volunteer in his French-gray greatcoat , returning from furlough , or a newmade officer travelling to join his regiment , in his new-made uniform , which was perhaps all of the military character that he had about him ,  --  but proud of his eagle-buttons , and likely enough to do them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , in short , so far as hustle and movement went , was more quiet than in ordinary times , because so large a proportion of its restless elements had been drawn towards the seat of conflict* But the air was full of a vague disturbance . To me , at least , it seemed so , emerging from such a solitude as has been hinted at , and the more impressible by rumors and indefinable presentiments , since I had not lived , like other men , in an atmosphere of continual talk about the war . A battle was momentarily expected on the Potomac ; for , though our army was still on the hither si ( le of the river , all of us were lookino towards the mysterious and terrible Manassas , with the idea that somewhere in its neighborhood lay a ghastly battlefield , yet to be fought , but foredoomed of old to be bloodier than the one where we had reaped such shame . Of all haunted places , methinks such a destined field should be thickest thron*ed with ugly phantoms , ominous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much greater abundance of military people . Between Baltimore and Washington a guard seemed to hold every station along the railroad ; and frequently , on the hill-sides , we saw a collection of weather-beaten tents , the peaks of which , blackened with smoke , indicated that they had been made comfortable by stove-heat throughout the winter . At several commuandin* positions we saw fortifications , with the muzzles of cannon protruding from the ramparts , the slopes of which were made of the yellow earth of that region , and still unsodded ; whereas , till these troublous times , there have been no forts but what were grass-grown with the lapse of at least a lifetime of peace . Our stoppingplaces were thronged with soldiers , some of whom came through the cars , asking for newspapers that contained accounts of the battle between the Merrimack and Monitor , which had been fought the ( lay before . A railway-train met us , conveying a regiment out of Washington to some unknown point ; and reaching the capital , we filed out of the station between lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind of similar spectacles // at the gates of European cities . It was not without sorrow that we saw the free circulation of the nation 's life-blood ( at the very heart , moreover ) clogged with such strictures as these , which have caused chronic diseases in almost all countries save our own . Will the time ever come again , in America , when we may live half a score of years without once seeing the likeness of a soldier , except it be in the festal march of a company on its summer tour ? Not in this generation , I fear , nor in the next , nor till the Millennium ; and even that blcssed cpoch , as the prophecies seem to intimate , will advance to the sound of the trumpet . One terrible idea occurs , in reference to this matter . Even supposing the war should end to-morrow , and the army melt into the mass of the population within the year , what an incalculable preponderance will there be of military titles and pretensions for at least half a century to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its three or four colonels , half a dozen majors , and captains without end , - besides non-commissioned officers and privates , more than the recruiting-offices ever knew of , - all with their campaign-stories , which will become the staple of fireside-talk forevermore . Military merit , or rather , since that is not so readily estimated , military notoriety , will be the measure of all claims to civil distinction . One bullet-headed general will succeed another in the Presidential chair ; and veterans will hold the offices at home and abroad , and sit in Congress and the State legislatures , and fill all the avenues of public life . And yet I do not speak of this deprecatingly , since , very likely , it may substitute something more real and genuine , instead of the many shams on which men have heretofore founded their claims to public regard ; but it behooves civilians to consider their wretched prospects in the future , and assume the military button before it is too late . We were not in time to see Washington as a camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men had crossed the Potomac on their march towards Manassas ; and almost with their first step into the Virginia mud , the phautasmagory of a countless host and impregnable ramparts , before which they had so long remained quiescent , dissolved quite away . It was as if Gencral McClellan had thrust his sword into a gigantic enemy , and , beholding him suddenly collapse , had discovered to himself and the world that he had merely punctured an enormously swollen bladder . There are instances of a similar character iii old romances , where great armies are long kept at bay by the arts of necromancers , who build airy towers and battlements , and muster warriors of terrible aspect , and thus feign a defence of seeming impregnability , until some bolder champion of the besiegers dashes forward to try an encounter with the foremost foemari , and finds him melt away in the death-grapple . With such heroic adventures let the march upon Manassas be hereafter reckoned . The whole business , though connected with the destinies of a nation , takes inevitably a tinge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - the majestic patience and docility with which the people waited through those weary and dreary months ,  --  the martial skill , courage , and caution , with which our movement was ultimately made ,  --  and , at last , the tremendous shock with which we were brought suddenly up against nothing at all ! The Southerners show little sense of humor nowadays , but I think they must have meant to provoke a laugh at our expense , when they planted those Quaker guns . At all events , no other Rebel artillery has played upon us with such overwhelming effect . The troops being gone , we had the better leisure and opportunity to look into other matters . It is natural enough to suppose that the centre and heart of Washington is the Capitol ; and certainly , in its outward aspect , the world has not many statelier or more beautiful edifices , nor any , I should suppose , more skilfully adapted to legislative purposes , and // to all accompanying needs . But , etc. , etc. * We found one man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate to the business which brought him thither . In quest of him , we went through halls , galleries , and corridors , and ascended a noble staircase , halustraded with a dark and beautifully variegated marble from Tennessee , the richness of which is quite a sufficient cause for objecting to the secession of that State . At last we came to a barrier of pine hoards , built right across the stairs . Knocking at a rounh , temporary door , we thrust a card beneath and in a minute or two it was opened by a person in his shirt-sleeves , a middleaged figure , neither tall nor short , of Teutonic build and aspect , with an ample beard of a ruddy tinge and chestnut hair . He looked at us , in the first place , with keen and somewhat guarded eyes , as if it were not his practice to vouchsafe any great warmth of greeting , except upon sure ground of observation . Soon , however , his look grew kindly and genial , ( not that it had ever been in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leutze allowed us to gaze at the cartoon of his great fresco , and talked about it unaffectedly , as only a man of true genius can speak of his own works . Meanwhile the noble design spoke for itself upon the wall . A sketch in color , which we saw afterwards , helped us to form some distant and flickering notion of what the picture will be , a few months hence , when these bare outlines , already so rich in thought and suggestiveness , shall glow with a fire of their own , - a fire which , I truly believe , will consume every other pictorial decoration of the - We omit several paragraphs here , in which the author speaks of some prominent Members of Congress with a freedom that seems to have been not unkindly meant , but might be liable to misconstruction . As he admits that he never listened to an important debate , we can hardly recognize his qualification to estimate these gentlemen , in their legislative and oratorical capacities . July , Capitol , or , at least , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some less conspicuous gallery . The work will be emphatically original and American , embracing characteristics that neither art nor literature have yet dealt with , and producing new forms of artistic beauty from the natural features of the Rocky-Mountain region , which Leutze seems to have studied broadly and minutely . The garb of the hunters and wanderers of those deserts , too , under his free and natural management , is shown as the most picturesque of costumes . But it would be doing this admirable painter no kind office to overlay his picture with any more of my colorless and uncertain words ; so I shall merely add that it looked full of energy , hope , progress , irrepressible movement onward , all represented in a momentary pause of triumph ; and it was most cheering to feel its good augury at this dismal time , when our country might seem to have arrived at such a deadly stand-still . It was an absolute comfort , indeed , to find Leutze so quietly busy at this great national work , which is destined to glow for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall stand , or must share its fate , if treason shall succeed in subverting it with the Union which it represents . It was delightful to see him so calmly elahorating his design , while other men douhted and feared , or hoped treacherously , and whispered to one another that the nation would exist only a little longer , or that , if a remnant still held together , its centre and seat of government would be far northward and westward of Washington . But the artist keeps right on , firm of heart and hand , drawing his outlines with an unwavering pencil , beautifying and idealizing our rude , material life , and thus manifesting that we have an indefeasible claim to a more enduring national existence . In honest truth , what with the hope-inspiring influence of the design , and what with Leutze 's undisturbed evolvement of it , I was exceedingly encouraged , and allowed these cheerful au0uries to weigh against // a sinister omen that was pointed out to me in another part of the Capitol . The freestone walls of the central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come thundering down , under the immense weiaht of the iron dome , - an appropriate catastrophe enough , if it should occur on the day when we drop the Southern stars out of our flag . Everybody seems to he at Washington , and yet there is a singular dearth of imperatively noticeable people there . I question whether there are half a dozen individuals , in all kinds of eminence , at whom a stranger , wearied with the contact of a hundred moderate celebrities , would turn round to snatch a second glance . Secretary Seward , to he sure , - a pale , large-nosed , elderly man , of moderate stature , with a decided originality of gait and aspect , and a cigar in his mouth , - etc. , etc. * Of course , there was one other personage , in the class of statesmen , whom I should have been truly mortified to leave Washington without seeing since ( temporarily , at least , and hy force of circumstances ) he was the man of men . But a private grief had built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intercourse of Americans with their chief magistrate so that I might have come away without a glimpse of his very remarkable physiognomy , save for a semiofficial opportunity of which I was glad to take advantage . The fact is , we were invited to annex ourselves , as supernumeraries , to a deputation that was about to wait upon the President , from a Massachusetts whip-factory , with a present of a splendid whip . Our immediate party consisted only of four or five , ( including Major Ben Perley Poore , with his note-hook and pencil , ) * We are again compelled to interfere with our friend 's license of personal description and criticism . Even Cabinet Ministers ( to whom the next few pages of the article were devoted ) have their private immunities , which ought to be conscientiously observed , - unless , indeed , the writer chanced to have some very piquant motives for violating them . hut we were joined by several other persons , who seemed to have been lounging ahout the precincts of the White House , under the spacious porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us to take the chances of a presentation . Thne o'clock had been appointed as the time for receiving the deputation , and we were punctual to the moment ; hut not so the President , who sent us word that he was eating his breakfast , and would come as soon as he could . His appetite , we were glad to think , must have been a pretty fair one ; for we waited about half an hour in one of the antechambers , and then were ushered into a reception-room , in one corner of which sat the Secretaries of War and of the Treasury , expecting , like ourselves , the termination of the Presidential breakfast . During this interval there were several new additions to our group , one or two of whom were in a working-garh , so that we formed a very miscellaneous collection of people , mostly unknown to each other , and without any common sponsor , but all with an equal right to look our head-servant in the face . By-and-by there was a little stir on the staircase and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! what liberties have I been taking with one of the potentates of the earth , and the man on whose conduct more important consequences depend than on that of any other historical personage of the century ! But with whom is an American citizen entitled to take a liberty , if not with his own chief magistrate ? However , lest the above allusions to President Lincoln 's little peculiarities " * We are compelled to omit two or three pages , in which the author describes the interview , and gives his idea of the personal appearance and deportment of the President . The sketch appears to have been written in a benign spirit , and perhaps conveys a not inaccurate impression of its august subject ; but it lacks reverence , and it pains us to see a gentleman of ripe a& , and who has spent years under the corrective influemice of foreign institutions , falling into the characteristic arid most ominous fault of Young America . // ( already well known to the country and to the world ) should be misinterpreted , I deem it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him , of unfeigned respect and measurable confidence . He is evidently a man of keen faculties , and , what is still more to the purpose , of powerful character . As to his integrity , the people have that intuition of it which is never deceived . Before he actually entered upon his great office , and for a considerable time afterwards , there is no reason to suppose that he adequately estimated the gigantic task about to be imposed on him , or , at least , had any distinct idea how it was to be managed ; and I presume there may have been more than one veteran politician who proposed to himself to take the power out of President Lincoln 's hands into his own , leaving our honest friend only the public responsibility for the good or ill success of the career . The extremely imperfect development of his statesmanly qualities , at that period , may have justified such designs . But the President is teachable by events , and has now spent a year in a very arduous course of education ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and convertible towards far loftier studies and activities than those of his early life ; and if he came to Washington a backwoods humorist , he has already transformed himself into as good a statesman ( to speak moderately ) as his prime-minister . Among other excursions to camps and places of interest in the neighborhood of Washington , we went , one day , to Alexandria . It is a little port on the Potomac , with one or two shabby wharves and docks , resembling those of a fishingvillage in New England , and the respectable old brick town rising gently behind . In peaceful times it no doubt bore an aspect of decorous quietude and dulness ; but it was now thronred with the Northern soldiery , whose stir and bustle contrasted strikingly with the many closed warehouses , the absence of citizens from their customary haunts , and the lack of any symptom of healthy activity , while army-wagons trundled heavily over the pavements , and sentinels paced the sidewalks , and mounted dragoons dashed to and fro on military errands . I tried to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in a sober town of Massachusetts ; and the thought considerably lessened my wonder at the cold and shy regards that are cast upon our troops , the gloom , the sullen demeanor , the declared or scarcely hidden sympathy with rebellion , which are so frequent here . It is a strange thing in human life , that the greatest errors both of men and women often spring from their sweetest and most generous qualities ; and so , undoubtedly , thousands of warm-hearted , sympathetic , and impulsive persons have joined the iRebels , not from any real zeal for the cause , but because , between two conflicting loyalties , they chose that which necessarily lay nearest the heart . There never existed any other Government against which treason was so easy , and could defend itself by such plausible arguments as against that of the United States . The anomaly of two allegiances ( of which that of the State comes nearest home to a man 's feelings , and includes the altar and the hearth , while the General Government claims his devotion only to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a flag ) is exceedingly mischievous in this point of view ; for it has converted crowds of honest people into traitors , who seem to themselves not merely innocent , but patriotic , and who die for a bad cause with as quiet a conscience as if it were the best . In the vast extent of our country , - too vast by far to be taken into one small human heart ,  - -  we inevitably limit to our own State , or , at farthest , to our own section , that sentiment of physical love for the soil which renders an Englishman , for example , so intensely sensitive to the dignity and well-being of his little island , that one hostile foot , treading anywhere upon it , would make a bruise on each individual breast . If a man loves his own State , therefore , and is content to be ruined with her , let us shoot him , if we can , but 9 // allow him an honorable burial in the soil he fights for. * In Alexandria , we visited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spot where he fell , and the stairs below , whence Jackson fired the fatal shot , and where he himself was slain a moment afterwards ; so that the assassin and his victim must have met on the threshold of the spirit-world , and perhaps came to a better understanding before they had taken many steps on the other side . Ellsworth was too generous to bear an immortal grudge for a deed like that , done in hot blood , and by no skulking enemy . The memorial-hunters have completely cut away the original wood-work around the spot , with their pocket-knives ; and the staircase , balustrade , and floor , as well as the adjacent doors and doorframes , have recently been renewed ; the walls , moreover , are covered with new paper-hangin*s , the former having been torn off in tatters ; and thus it becomes something like a metaphysical question whether the place of the murder actually exists . Driving out of Alexandria , we stopped on the edge of the city to inspect an old slave-pen , which is one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a little farther on , we came to a brick church where Washington used sometimes to attend service , - a pre-Revolutionary edifice , with ivy growing over its walls , though not very luxuriantly . Reaching the open country , we saw forts and camps on all sides ; some of the tents being placed immediately on the ground , while others were raised over a basement of logs , laid lengthwise , like those of a log-hut , or driven vertically into the soil in a circle ,  - -  thus forming a solid wall , the chinks closed up with Yirginia mud , and above it the pyramidal shelter of the tent . Here were in progress all the occupations , and all the idleness , of the soldier in the tented * We do not thoroughly comprehend the author 's drift in the foregoing paragraph , hut are inclined to think its tone reprehensible , and its tendency impolitic in the present stage of our national difficulties . field : some were cooking the companyrations in pots hung over fires in the open air ; some played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise ; some read newspapers ; some smoked cigars or pipes ; and many were cleaning their arms and accoutrements ,  - -  the more carefully , perhaps , because their division was to he reviewed by the Commander-in-Chief that afternoon ; others sat on the ground , while their comrades cut their hair ,  --  it being a soldierly fashion ( and for excellent reasons ) to crop it within an inch of the skull ; others , finally , lay asleep in breast-high tents , with their legs protruding into the open air . We paid a visit to Fort Ellsworth , and from its ramparts ( which have been heaped up out of the muddy soil within the last few months , and will require still a year or two to make them verdant ) we had a beautiful view of the Potomac , a truly majestic river , and the surrounding country . The fortifications , so numerous in all this region , and now so unsightly with their bare , precipitous sides , will remain as historic monuments , grass-grown and picturesque memorials of an epoch of terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearer and more interesting to us , and afford fit soil for poetry to root itself in : for this is a plant which thrives best in spots where blood has been spilt long ago , and grows in abundant clusters in old ditches , such as the moat around Fort Ellsworth will be a century hence . It may seem to be paying dear for what many will reckon but a worthless weed ; but the more historical associations we can link with our localities , the richer will be the daily life that feeds upon the past , and the more valuable the things that have been long established : so that our children will be less prodigal than their fathers in sacrificing good institutions to passionate impulses and impracticable thuories . This herb of grace , let us hope , may be found in the old footprints of the war . Even in an resthetic point of view , however , the war has done a great deal of enduring mischief , by causing the dev // astation of great tracts of woodland scenery , in which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Around all the encampments , and everywhere along the road , we saw the bare sites of what had evidently heen tracts of hard-wood forest , indicated by the unsightly stumps of well-grown trees , not smoothly felled by regular axe-men , but hacked , haggled , and unevenly amputated , as by a sword , or other miserable tool , in an unskilful hand . Fifty years will not repair this desolation . An army destroys everything before and around it , even to the very grass ; for the sites of the encampments are converted into barren esplanades , like those of the squares in French cities , where not a blade of grass is allowed to grow . As to other symptoms of devastation and obstruction , such as deserted houses , unfenced fields , and a general aspect of nakedness and ruin , I know not how much may be due to a normal lack of neatness in the rural life of Virginia , which puts a squalid face even upon a prosperous state of things ; but undoubtedly the war must have spoilt what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The carcasses of horses were scattered along the way-side . One very pregnant token of a social system thoroughly disturbed was presented by a party of contrabands , escaping out of the mysterious depths of Secessia ; and its strangeness consisted in the leisurely delay with which they trudged forward , as dreading no pursuer , and encountering nobody to turn them hack . They were unlike the specimens of their race whom we are accustomed to see at the North , and , in my judgment , were far more agreeable . So rudely were they attired , - as if their garb had grown upon them spontaneously , - so picturesquely natural in manners , and wearing such a crust of primeval simplicity , ( which is quite polished away from the Northern black man , ) that they seemed a kind of creature by themselves , not altogether human , but perhaps quite as good , and akin to the fauns and rustic deities of olden times . I wonder whether I shall excite anybody 's wrath by saying this . It is no great matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor fugitives , but knew not precisely what to wish in their behalf , nor in the least how to help them . For the sake of the manhood which is latent in them , I would not have turned them back ; but I should have felt almost as reluctant , on their own account , to hasten them forward to the stranger 's land ; and I think my prevalent idea was , that , whoever may be benefited by the results of this war , it will not be the present generation of negroes , the childhood of whose race is now gone forever , and who must henceforth fight a hard battle with the world , on very unequal terms . On behalf of my own race , I am glad , and can only hope that an inscrutable Providence means good to both parties . There is an historical circumstance , known to few , that connects the children of the Puritans with these Africans of Virginia , in a very singular way . They are our brethren , as being lineal descendants from the Mayflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage , sent forth a brood of Pilgrims upon Plymouth Rock , and , in a subsequent one , spawned slaves upon the Southern soil , - a monstrous birth , but with which we have an instinctive sense of kindred , and so are stirred by an irresistible impulse to attempt their rescue , even at the cost of blood and ruin . The character of our sacred ship , I fear , may suffer a little by this revelation ; but we must let her white progeny offset her dark one , - and two such portents never sprang from an identical source before . While we drove onward , a young officer on horseback looked earnestly into the carriage , and recognized some faces that he had seen before ; so he rode along by our side , and we pestered him with queries and observations , to which he responded more civilly than they deserved . He was on General McClellan 's staff , and a gallant cavalier , high-booted , with a revolver in his belt , and mounted on a noble horse , which trotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed seat . His face had a healthy hue of exposure and an expression of carelesshardihood* and , as I looked at him , it seemed to me that the war had brought good fortune to the youth of this epoch , if to none beside ; since they now make it their daily business to ride a horse and handle a sword , instead of lounging listlessly through the duties , occupations , pleasures - all tedious alike - to which the artificial state of society limits a peaceful generation . The atmosphere of the camp and the smoke of the battle-field are morally invigoratin* the hardy virtues flourish in them , the nonsense dies like a wilted weed . The enervating effects of centuries of civilization vanish at once , arid leave these young men to enjoy a life of hardship , and the exhilarating sense of danger , - to kill men blamelessly , or to be killed gloriously , - and to be happy in following out their native instincts of destruction , precisely in the spirit of Homer 's heroes , only with some considerable change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole world , but all time , akin . Set men face to face , with weapons in their hands , and they are as ready to slaughter one another now , after playing at peace and good-will for so many years , as in the rudest ages , that never heard of peace-societies , and thought no wine so delicious as what they quaffed from an enemy 's skull . Indeed , if the report of a Congressional committee may be trusted , that old-fashioned kind of goblet has again come into use , at the expense of our Northern head-pieces , - a costly drinking-cup to him that furnishes it ! Heaven forgive me for seeming to jest upon such a subject ! - only , it is so odd , when we measure our advances from barbarism , and find ourselves just here ! * We now approached General MeClel * We hardly expected this outbreak in favor of war from the Peaceable Man ; but the justice of our cause makes us all soldiers at heart , however quiet in our outward life . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania regiment . lan 's head-quarters , which , at that time , were established at Fairfield Seminary . The edifice was situated on a gentle elevation , amid very agreeable scenery , and , at a distance , looked like a gentleman 's seat . Preparations were going forward for reviewing a division of ten or twelve thousand men , the various regiments composing which had begun to array themselves on an extensive plain , where , methought , there was a more convenient place for a battle than is usually found in this broken and difficult country . Two thousand cavalry made a portion of the troops to be reviewed . By-and-by we saw a pretty numerous troop of mounted officers , who were congregated on a distant part of the plain , and whom we finally ascertained to be the Commander-in-Chief 's staff , with McClellan himself at their head . Our party managed to establish itself in a position conveniently close to the General , to whom , moreover , we had the honor of an introduction ; and he bowed , on his horseback , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no airs nor fuss nor pretension beyond what his character and rank inevitably gave him . Now , at that juncture , and , in fact , up to the present moment , there was , and is , a most fierce and bitter outcry , and detraction loud and low , against General McClellan , accusing him of sloth , imbecility , cowardice , treasonable purposes , and , in short , utterly denying his ability as a soldier , and questioning his integrity as a man . Nor was this to be wondered at ; for when before , in all history , do we find a general in command of half a million of men , and in presence of an enemy inferior in numbers and no better disciplined than his own troops , leaving it still debatable , after the better part of a year , whether he is a soldier or no ? The question would seem to answer itself in the very asking . Nevertheless , being most profoundly ignorant of the art of war , like the majority of the General 's critics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressibility by men 's characters , I was glad // of the opportunity to look him in the face , and to feel whatever influence might reach me from his sphere . So I stared at him , as the phrase goes , with all the eyes I had ; and the reader shall have the benefit of what I saw ,  --  to which he is the more welcome , because , in writing this article , I feel disposed to be singularly frank , and can scarcely restrain myself from telling truths the utterance of which I should get slender thanks for . The General was dressed in a simple , dark-blue uniform , without epaulets , hooted to the knee , and with a cloth cap upon his head ; and , at first sight , you mi* , ht have taken him for a corporal of dragoons , of particularly neat and soldier-like aspect , and in the prime of his age and strength . He is only of middling stature , but his build is very compact and sturdy , with broad shoulders and a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is said to possess , - he and Beaure*ard having been rivals in that particular , and both distinguished above other men . His complexion is dark and sanguine , with dark hair . He has a strong , bold , soldierly face , full of decision ; a Roman nose , by no means a thin prominence , but very thick and firm ; and if he follows it , ( which I should think likely , ) it may be pretty confidently trusted to guide him aright . His profile would make a more effective likeness than the full face , which , however , is much better in the real man than in any photograph that I have seen . His forehead is not remarkably large , but comes forward at the eyebrows ; it is not the brow nor countenance of a prominently intellectual man , ( not a natural student , I mean , or abstract thinker , ) but of one whose office it is to handle things practically and to bring about tangible results . His face looked capable of being very stern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it , an aspect pleasant and dignified ; it is not , in its character , an American face , nor an English one . The man on whom he fixes his eye is conscious of him . In his natural disposition , he seems calm and self-possessed , sustaining his great responsibilities cheerfully , without shrinking , or weariness , or spasmodic effort , or damage to his health , but all with quiet , deep-drawn breaths ; just as his broad shoulders would bear up a heavy burden without aching beneath it . After we had had sufficient time to peruse the man , ( so far as it could be done with one pair of very attentive eyes , ) the General rode off , followed by his cavalcade , and was lost to sight among the troops . They received him with loud shouts , by the eager uproar of which - now near , now in the centre , now on the outskirts of the division , and now sweeping back towards us in a great volume of sound - we could trace his progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a traitor , or a humbug , or anything less than a brave , true , and able man , that mass of intelligent soldiers , whose lives and honor he had in charge , were utterly deceived , and so was this present writer ; for they behieved in him , and so did I ; and had I stood in the ranks , I should have shouted with the lustiest of them . Of course I may be mistaken ; my opinion on such a point is worth nothing , although my impression may be worth a little more ; neither do I consider the General 's antecedents as bearing very decided testimony to his practical soldiership . A thorough knowledge of the science of war seems to be conceded to him ; he is allowed to be a good military critic ; but all this is possible without his possessing any positive qualities of a great general , just as a literary critic may show the profoundest acquaintance with the principles of epic poetry without being able to produce a single stanza of an epic poem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General McClellan 's soldiership until he is defeated , nor in his courage and integrity even then . Another of our excursions was to Harper 's Ferry , - the Directors of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad having kindly invited us to accompany them on the first trip over the newly laid track , after // its breaking up by the Rebels . It bega.n to rain , in the early morning , pretty soon after we left Washington , and continued to pour a cataract tbrougbout the day ; so that the aspect of the country was dreary , where it would otherwise have been delightful , as we entered among the bill-scenery that is formed by the subsiding swells of the Alleghanies . The latter part of our journey lay along the shore of the Potomac , in its upper course , where the margin of that noble river is bordered by gray , overhanging crags , beneath which - and sometimes right through them - the railroad takes its way . In one place the Rebels had attempted to arrest a train by precipitating an immense mass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it still lay , deeply imbedded in the ground , and looking as if it might have lain there since the Deluge . The scenery grew even more picturesque as we proceeded , the bluffs becoming very bold in their descent upon the river , which , at Harper 's Ferry , presents as striking a vista among the hills as a painter could desire to see . But a beautiful landscape is a luxury , and luxuries are thrown away amid discomfort ; and when we alighted into the tenacious mud and almost fathomless puddle , on the hither side of the Ferry , ( the ultimate point to which the cars proceeded , since the railroad bridge had been destroyed by the Rebels , ) I can not remember that any very rapturous emotions were awakened by the scenery . We paddled and floundered over the ruins of the track , and , scrambling down an embankment , crossed the Potomac by a pontoon - bridge , a thousand feet in length , over the narrow line of which - level with the river , and rising and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole army , with its ponderous artillery and heavily laden wagons . Yet our own tread made it vibrate . The broken bridge of the railroad was a little below us , and at the base of one of its massive piers , in the rocky bed of the river , lay a locomo tive , which the Rebels had precipitated there . As we passed over , we looked towards the Virginia shore , and beheld the little town of Harper 's Feriy , gathered about the base of a round hill and climbing up its steep acclivity ; so that it somewhat resembled the Etruscan cities which I have seen among the Apennines , rushing , as it were , down an apparently breakneck height . About midway of the ascent stood a shabby brick church , towards which a difficult path went scrambling up the precipice , indicating , one would say , a very fervent aspiration on the part of the worshippers , unless there was some easier mode of access in another direction . Immediately on the shore of the Potomac , and extending back towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States arsenal and armory , consisting of piles of broken bricks and a waste of shapeless demolition , amid which we saw gun-barrels in heaps of hundreds together . They were the relics of the conflagration , bent with the heat of the fire , and rusted with the wintry rain to which they had since been exposed . The brightest sunshine could not have made the scene cheerful , nor have taken away the gloom from the dilapidated town ; for , besides the natural shabbiness , and decayed , unthrifty look of a Virginian village , it has an inexpressible forlornness resulting from the devastations of war and its occupation by both armies alternately . Yet there would be a less striking contrast between Southern and New- England villages , if the former were as much in the habit of using white paint as we are . It is prodigiously efficacious in putting a bright face upon a bad matter . There was one small shop , which appeared to have nothing for sale . A single man and one or two boys were all the inhabitants in view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts regiments , who were scattered about pretty numerously . A guardhouse stood on the slope of the bill ; and in the level street at its base were the // offices of ' the Provost-Marshal and other military authorities , to whom we forthwith reported ourselves . The ProvostMarshal kindly sent a corporal to guide us to the little building which John Brown seized upon as his fortress , and which , after it was stormed by the United States marines , became his temporary prison . It is an old engine-house , rusty and shabby , like every other work of man 's hands in this God-forsaken town , and stands fronting upon the river , only a short distance from the bank , nearly at the point where the pontoon-brid*e touches the Virginia shore . In its front wall , on each side of the door , are two or three ragged loop - holes which John Brown perforated for his defence , knocking out merely a brick or two , so as to give himself and his garrison a sight over their rifles . Through these orifices the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among his assailants , until they broke down the door by thrusting against it with a ladder , and tumbled headlong in upon him . I shall not pretend to be an admirer of old John Brown , any farther than sympathy with Whittier 's excellent ballad about him may go ; nor did I expect ever to shrink so unutterably from any apophthegm of a sage , whose happy lips have uttered a hundred golden sentences , as from that saying , ( perhaps falsely attributed to so honored a source , ) that the death of this blood-stained fanatic has " made the Gallows as venerable as the Cross ! " Nobody was ever more justly hanged . He won his martyrdom fairly , and took it firmly . He himself , I am persuaded , ( such was his natural integrity , ) would have acknowledged that Virginia had a right to take the life which he had staked and lost ; although it would have been better for her , in the hour that is fast coming , if she could generously have forgotten the criminality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , any common-sensible man , looking at the matter unsentimentally , must have felt a certain intellectual satisfaction in seeing him hanged , if it were only in requital of his preposterous miscalculation of possibilities. * But , coolly as I seem to say these things , my Yankee heart stirred triumphantly when I saw the use to which John Brown 's fortress and prison-house has now been put . What right have I to complain of any other man 's foolish impulses , when I can not possibly control my own ? The engine-house is now a place of confinement for Rebel prisoners . A Massachusetts soldier stood on guard , but readily permitted our whole party to enter . It was a wretched place . A room of perhaps twenty-five feet square occupied the whole interior of the building , having an iron stove in its centre , whence a rusty funnel ascended towards a hole in the roof ; which served the purposes of ventilation , as well as for the exit of smoke . We found ourselves right in the midst of the Rebels , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or , at all events , giving no sign of consciousness others sat in the corners of the room , huddled close together , and staring with a lazy kind of interest at the visitors two were astride of some planks , playing with the dirtiest pack of cards that I ever happened to see . There was only one figure in the least military among all these twenty prisoners of war , - a man with a dark , intelligent , moustached face , wearing a shabby cotton uniform , which he had contrived to arrange with a decree of soldierly smartness , though it had evidently borne the brunt of a very filthy campaign . He stood erect , and talked freely with those who addressed him , telling them his place of residence , the number of his regiment , the circumstances of his capture , and such other particulars as their Northern inquisitiveness prompted them to ask . I liked the manliness of his deportment ; he was neither ashamed , nor afraid , nor in the slightest degree sullen , peppery , or contumacious , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his enemies was left upon the battle-field , * Can it be a son of old Massachusetts who utters this abominable sentiment ? For shame ! // and would not be resumed till he had again a weapon in his hand . Neither could I detect a trace of hostile feeling in the countenance , words , or manner of any prisoner there . Almost to a man , they were simple , bumpkin-like fellows , dressed in homespun clothes , with faces singularly vacant of meaning , but sufficiently good-humored : a breed of men , in short , such as I did not suppose to exist in this country , although I have seen their like in some other parts of the world . They were peasants , and of a very low order : a class of people with whom our Northern rural population has not a single trait in common . They were exceedingly respectful , - more so than a rustic NewEn*lander ever dreams of being towards anyhody , except perhaps his minister ; and had they worn any hats , they would probably have heen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being permitted to hold conversation with well-dressed persons . It is my belief that not a single bumpkin of them all ( the moustached soldier always excepted ) had the remotest comprehension of what they had been fighting for , or how they had deserved to be shut up in that dreary hole ; nor , possibly , did they care to inquire into this latter mystery , but took it as a godsend to be suffered to lie here in a heap of unwashed human bodies , well warmed and well foddered to-day , and without the necessity of bothering themselves about the possible hunger and cold of to-morrow . Their dark prison-life may have seemed to them the sunshine of all their lifetime . There was one poor wretch , a wildbeast of a man , at whom I gazed with greater interest than at his fellows ; although I know not that each one of them , in their semi-barbarous moral state , might not have been capable of the same savage impulse that had made this particular individual a horror to all beholders . At the close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crept on hands and knees to his feet , and besought his assistance , - not dreaming that any creature in human shape , in the Christian land where they had so recently been brethren , could refuse it . But this man ( this fiend , if you prefer to call him so , though I would not advise it ) flung a bitter curse at the poor Northerner , and absolutely trampled the soul out of his body , as he lay writhing beneath his feet . The fellow 's face was horribly ugly ; but I am not quite sure that I should have noticed it , if I had not known his story . He spoke not a word , and met nobody 's eye , but kept staring upward into the smoky vacancy towards the ceiling , where , it might be , he beheld a continual portraiture of his victim 's horror-stricken agonies . I rather fancy , however , that his moral sense was yet too torpid to trouble him with such remorseful visions , and that , for his own part , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's death , if other eyes had not been bent reproachfully upon him and warned him that something was amiss . it was this reproach in other men 's eyes that made him look aside . He was a wild-beast , as I began with sayin , - an unsophisticated wild-beast , - while the rest of us are partially tamed , though still the scent of blood excites some of the savage instincts of our nature . What this wretch needed , in order to make him capable of the degree of mercy and benevolence that exists in us , was simply such a measure of moral and intellectual development as we have received ; and , in my mind , the present war is so well justified by no other consideration as by the probability that it will free this class of Southern whites from a thraldom in which they scarcely be , in to be responsible beings . So far as the education of the heart is concerned , the negroes have apparently the advantage of them ; and as to other schooling , it is practically unattainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners , therefore , it struck me as an immense absurdity that they should fancy us their enemies ; since , whether we intend it so // or no , they have a far greater stake on our success than we can possibly have . For ourselves , the balance of advantages between defeat and triumph may admit of question . For them , all truly valuable things are dependent on our complete success ; for thence would come the reo'eneration of a people , - the removal of a foul scurf that has overgrown their life , and keeps them in a state of disease and decrepitude , one of the chief symptoms of which is , that , the more they suffer and are debased , the more they imagine themselves strong and beautiful . No human effort , on a grand scale , has ever yet resulted according to the purpose of its projectors . The advantages are always incidental . Man 's accidents are God 's purposes . We miss the good we sought , and do the good we little cared for. * Our Government evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most available citizens ; for , quite unexpectedly , we were joined with some other gentlemen , scarcely less competent than ourselves , in a commission to proceed to Fortress Monroe and examine into things in general . Of course , official propriety compels us to be extremely guarded in our description of the interesting objects which this expedition opened to our view . There can be no harm , however , in stating that we were received by the commander of the fortress with a kind of acid good-nature , or mild cynicism , that indicated him to be a humorist , characterized by certain rather pungent peculiarities , yet of no unamiable cast . lie is a small , thin old gentleman , set off by a large pair of brilliant epaulets , - the only pair , so far as my observation went , it ' at adorn the shoulders of any officer in rLhe Union army . Either for our inspeeor because the matter had already he arranged , he drew out a regiment * author seems to imagine that he has compressed a great deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom . We disag ae with him . The counsels of wise and good men are often coincident with the purposes of Providence ; and the present war promises to Illustrate our remark . of Zonaves that formed the principal part of his garrison , and appeared at their head , sitting on horseback with rigid perpendicularity , and affording us a vivid idea of the disciplinarian of Baron Steuben 's school . There can be no question of the General 's military qualities ; he must have been especially useful in converting raw recruits into trained and efficient soldiers . But valor and martial skill are *f so evanescent a character , ( hardly less fleeting than a woman 's beauty , ) that Government has perhaps taken the safer course in assigning to this gallant officer , though distinguished in former wars , no more active duty than the guardianship of an apparently impregnable fortress . The ideas of military men solidify and fossilize so fast , while military science makes such rapid advances , that even here there might be a difficulty . An active , diversified , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick exigencies of this singular war . Fortress Monroe , for example , in spite of the massive solidity of its ramparts , its broad and deep moat , and all the contrivances of defence that were known at the not very remote epoch of its construction , is now pronounced absolutely incapable of resisting the novel modes of assault which may be brought to bear upon it . It can only be the flexible talent of a young man that will evolve a new efficiency out of its obsolete strength . It is a pity that old men grow unfit for war , not only by their incapacity for new ideas , hut by the peaceful and unadventurous tendencies that gradually possess themselves of the once turbulent disposition , which used to snpff the battle-smoke as its congenial atmosphere . It is a pity ; because it would be such an economy of human existence , if time-stricken people ( whose value I have the better right to estimate , as reckoning myself one of them ) could snatch from their juniors the exclusive privilege of carrying on the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unequal would be the comparative sacrifice ! On one part , a few // unenjoyable years , the little remnant of a life grown torpid ; on the other , the many fervent summers of manhood in its spring and prime , with all that they include of possible benefit to mankind . Then , too , a bullet offers such a brief and easy way , such a pretty little orifice , through which the weary spirit might seize the opportunity to be cxhaled ! If I had the ordering of these matters , fifty should he the tenderest age at which a recruit might he accepted for training ; at fifty-five or sixty , I would consider him eligible for most kinds of military duty and exposure , excluding that of a forlorn hope , which no soldier should be permitted to volunteer upon , short of the ripe age of seventy . As a general rule , these venerable combatants should have the preference for all dangerous and honorable service in the order of their seniority , with a distinction in favor of those whose infirmities mi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Methinks there would he no more Bull Runs ; a warrior with gout in his toe , or rheumatism in his joints , or with one foot in the grave , would make a sorry fugitive ! On this admirable system , the producfive part of the population would he undisturbed even by the bloodiest war ; and , best of all , those thousands upon thousands of our Northern girls , whose proper mates will perish in camp-hospitals or on Southern battle-fields , would avoid their doom of forlorn old-maidenhood . But , no doubt , the plan will he poohpoohed down hy the War Department though it could scarcely be more disastrous than the one on which we hegan the war , when a young army was struck with paralysis through the age of its commander . The waters around Fortress Monroe were thronged with a gallant array of ships of war and transports , wearing the Union flag , - " Old Glory , " as I hear it called in these days . A little withdrawn from our national fleet lay two French frigates , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banner which always makes itself visible , like a red portent in the air , wherever there is strife . In pursuance of our official duty , ( which had no ascertainahle limits , ) we went on hoard the flag-ship , and were shown over every part of her , and down into her depths , inspecting her gallant - crew , her powerful armament , her mighty engines , and her furnaces , where the fires are always kept hurning , as well at midnight as at noon , so that it would require only five minutes to put the vessel under full steam . This vigilance has been felt necessary ever since the Merrimack made that terrible dash from Norfolk . Splendid as she is , however , and provided with all but the very latest improvements in naval armament , the Minnesota belongs to a class of vessels that will be built no more , nor ever fight another battle ,  --  being as much a thing of the past as any of the ships of Queen Elizabeth 's time , which grappled with the galleons of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagofficer was pacing to and fro , with a selfconscious dignity to which a touch of the gout or rheumatism perhaps contributed a little additional stiffness . He seemed to he a gallant gentleman , but of the old , slow , and pompous school of naval worthies , who have grown up amid rules , forms , and etiquette which were adopted full - blown from the British navy into ours , and are somewhat too cumbrous for the quick spirit of to-day . This order of nautical heroes will probably go down , along with the ships in which they fought valorously and strutted most intolerably . How can an admiral condescend to go to sea in an iron pot ? What space and elbow - room *can be found for quarterdeck dignity in the cramped lookout of the Monitor , or even in the twenty-feet diameter of her cheese-box ? All the pomp and splendor of naval warfare are gone by . Henceforth there must come up a race of enginemen and smokeblackened cannoneers , who will hammer away at their enemies under the direction of a single pair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gripe is Science laying on our noble possibilities - will // become a quality of very minor importance , when its possessor can not break through the iron crust of his own armament and give the world a glimpse of it . At no great distance from the Minnesota lay the strangest-looking craft I ever saw . It was a platform of iron , so nearly on a level with the water that the swash of the waves broke over it , under the impulse of a very moderate breeze ; and on this platform was raised a circular structure , likewise of iron , and rather broad and capacious , but of no great height . It could not be called a vessel at all ; it was a machine , - and I have seen one of somewhat similar appearance employed in cleaning out the docks ; or , for lack of a better similitude , it looked like a gigantic rat-trap . It was ugly , questionable , suspicious , evidently mischievous , - nay , I will allow myself to call it devilish ; for this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same breed , to annihilate whole navies and batter down old supremacies . The wooden walls of Old England cease to exist , and a whole history of naval renown reaches its period , now that the Monitor comes smoking into view ; while the billows dash over what seems her deck , and storms bury even her turret in green water , as she burrows and snorts along , oftener under the surface than above . The singularity of the object has betrayed me into a more ambitious vein of description than I often indulge ; and , after all , I might as well have contented myself with simply saying that she looked very queer . Going on board , we were surprised at the extent and convenience of her interior accommodations . There is a spacious ward-room , nine or ten feet in height , besides a private cabin for the commander , and sleepin , , accommodations on an ample scale ; the whole well lighted and ventilated , though beneath the surface of the water . Forward , or aft , ( for it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively quite as well provided for as the officers . It was like finding a palace , with all its conveniences , under July , the sea . The inaccessibility , the apparent impregnability , of this submerged iron fortress are most satisfactory ; the officers and crew get down through a little hole in the deck , hermetically seal themselves , and go below ; and until they see fit to reappear , there would seem to be no power given to man whereby they can be brought to light . A storm of cannon-shot damages them no more than a handful of dried peas . We saw the shotmarks made by the great artillery of the Merrimack on the outer casin* , of the iron tower ; they were about the breadth and depth of shallow saucers , almost imperceptible dents* with no corresponding bulge on the interior surface . In fact , the *thing looked altogether too safe ; though it may not prove quite an agreeable predicament to be thus boxed up in impenetrable iron , with the possibility , one would imagine , of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even there , not drowned , but stifled . Nothing , however , can exceed the confidence of the officers in this new craft . It was pleasant to see their benign exultation in her powers of mischief , and the delight with which they exhibited the circumvolutory movement of the tower , the quick thrusting forth of the immense guns to deliver their ponderous missiles , and then the immediate recoil , and the security behind the closed port-holes . Yet even this will not long be the last and most terrible improvement in the science of war . Already we hear of vessels the armament of which is to act entirely beneath the surface of the water ; so that , with no other external symptoms than a great bubbling and foaming , and gush of smoke , and belch of smothered thunder out of the yeasty waves , there shall he a deadly fight going on below ,  --  and , by-and-by , a sucking whir1poo1 , as one of the ships goes down . The Monitor was certainly an object of great interest ; but on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw a spectacle that affected us with far profounder emotion . It was the sight of the few sticks that are left of the frigate Ckieft* , about War-Matters. // Congress , stranded near the shore ,  --  and still more , the masts of the Cumberland rising midway out of the water , with a tattered rag of a pennant fluttering from one of them . The invisible hull of the latter ship seems to be careened over , so that the three masts stand slantwise the rig* , ing looks quite unimpaired , except that a few ropes dangle loosely from the yards . The flag ( which never was struck , thank heaven ! ) is entirely hidden under the waters of the bay , but is still doubtless waving in its old place . although it floats to and fro with the swell and reflux of the tide , instead of rustling on the breeze . A remnant of the dead crew still man the sunken ship , and , sometimes a drowned body floats up to the surface. , That was a noble fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commodore Smith , the father of the commander of the Congress , when he heard that his son 's ship was surrendered ? " Then Joe s dead ! " said he ; and so it proved . Nor can any warrior be more certain of enduring renown than the gallant Morris , who fought so well the final battle of the old system of naval warfare , . and won glory for his country and himself out of inevitable disaster and defeat . fhat last gun from the Cumberland , when her deck was half submerged , sounded the requiem of many sinking ships . Then went down all the navies of Europe , and - our own , Old Ironsides and all , and Trafalgar and a thousand other fights became only a memory , never to be acted over again ; and thus our brave countrymen come last in the long procession of heroic sailors that includes Blake and Nelson , and so many mariners of England , and other mariner* as brave as they , whose renown is our native inheritance . There will be other battles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the battles of the past ; and , moreover , the Millennium is certainly approaching , because human strife is to be transferred from the heart and personality of man into cunning contrivances of machinery , which by-and-by will fight out our wars with only the clank and smash of iron , strewing the field with broken engines , but damaging nobody 's little finger except by accident . Such is obviously the tendency of modern improvement . But , in the mean while , so lon * as manhood retains any part of its pristine value , no country can afford 1*o let gallantry like that of Morris and his crew , any more than that of the brave Worden , pass unhonored and unrewarded . If the Government do , nothing , let the people take the matter into their own hands , and cities give him swords , gold boxes , festivals of triumph , and , if he needs it , heaps of gold . Let poets brood upon the theme , and make themselves sensible how much of the past and future is contained within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightning of a song ! From these various excursions , and a good many others , ( including one to Manassas , ) we gained a pretty lively idea of what was going on ; but , after all , if compelled to pass a rainy day in the hall and parlors of Willard 's hotel , it proved about as profitably spent as if we had floundered through miles of Virginia mud , in quest of interesting matter . This hotel , in fact , may be much more justly called the centre of Washington and the Union than either the Capitol , the White House , or the State Department . Everybody may be seen there . It is the meeting-place of the true representatives of the country , - not such as are chosen blindly and amiss by electors who take a folded ballot from the hand of a local politician , and thrust it into the ballotbox unread , but men who gravitate or are attracted hither by real business , or a native impulse to breathe the intensest atmosphere of the nation 's life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to deal with us . Nor these only , but all manner of loafers . Never , in any other spot , was there such a miscellany of people . You exchange nods with governors of sovereign States ; you elbow illustrious men , and tread on the toes of generals ; you hear statesmen and orators speaking in their familiar tones . You are mixed up with officeseekers , // wire-pullers , inventors , artists , poets , prosers , ( including editors , armycorrespondents , attache 's of foreign journals , and long-winded talkers , ) clerks , diplomatists , mail - contractors , railwaydirectors , until your own identity is lost among them . Occa*ionally you talk with a man whom you have never before heard of , and are struck by the brightness of a thought , and fancy that there is more wisdom hidden among the obscure than is anywhere revealed among the famous . You adopt the universal habit of the place , and call for a mint-julep , a whiskeyskin , a gin-cocktail , a brandy-smash , or a glass of pure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an early hour , and , so far as I had an opportunity of observing , never terminates at any hour , and all these drinks are continually in request by almost all these people . A constant atmosphere of cigar-smoke , too , envelopes the motley crowd , and forms a sympathetic medium , in which men meet more closely and talk more frankly than in any other kind of air . If legislators would smoke in session , they might speak truer words , and fewer of them , and bring about more valuable results . It is curious to observe what antiquated figures and costumes sometimes make their appearance at Willard 's . You meet elderly men with frilled shirt-fronts , for example , the fashion of which adornment passed away from among the people of this world half a century ago . It is as if one of Stuart 's portraits were walking abroad . I see no way of accounting for this , except that the trouble of the times , the impiety of traitors , and the peril of our sacred Union and Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the venerable fathers of the country , and summoned them forth to protest against the meditated and half-accomplished sacrilege . If it be so , their wonted fires are not altogether extinguished in their ashes , - in their throats , I might rather say ; - for I beheld one of these excellent old men quaffing such a horn of Bourbon whiskey as a toper of the present century would be loath to venture upon . But , really , one would be glad to know where these strange figures come from . It shows , at any rate , how many remote , decaying villages and country-neighborhoods of the North , and forest-nooks of the West , and old mansion-houses in cities , are shaken by the tremor of our native soil , so that men long hidden in retirement put on the garments of their youth and hurry out to inquire what is the matter . The old men whom we see here have generally more marked faces than the young ones , and naturally enough ; since it must be an extraordinary vigor and renewability of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the senior flexible enough to take an interest in new things ; whereas hundreds of commonplace young men come hither to stare with eyes of vacant wonder , and with vague hopes of finding out what they are fit for . And this war ( we may say so much in its favor ) has been the means of discovering that important secret to not a few . We saw at Willard 's many who had thus found out for themselves , that , when Nature gives a young man no other utilizable faculty , she must be understood as intending him for a soldier . The bulk of the army had moved out of Washington before we reached the city ; yet it seemed to me that at least two-thirds of the guests and idlers at the hotel wore one or another token of the military profession . Many of them , no doubt , were self-commissioned officers , and had put on the buttons and the shoulder-straps , and booted themselves to the knees , merely because captain , in these days , is so good a travelling-name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the President , but might be none the better warriors for that . It was pleasant , occasionally , to distinguish a grizzly veteran among this crowd of carpet-knights ,  --  the trained soldier of a lifetime , long ago from West Point , who had spent his prime upon the frontier , and very likely could show an Indian bullet-mark on his breast , - if such decorations , won in an obscure warfare , were worth the showing now . The question often occurred to me , - // and , to say the truth , it added aa indefinable piquancy to the scene , - what proportion of all these people , whether soldiers or civilians , were true at heart to the Union , and what part were tainted , more or less , with treasonable sympathies and wishes , even if such had never blossomed into purpose . Traitors there were among them , - no doubt of that , - civil servants of the public , very reputable persons , who yet deserved to dangle from a cord ; or men who buttoned military coats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might bring the gallant officer to stand pale-faced before a file of musketeers , with his open grave behind him . But , without insisting upon such picturesque criminality and punishment as this , an observer , who kept both his eyes and heart open , would find it by no means difficult to discern that many residents and visitors of Washington so far sided with the South as to desire nothing more nor better than to see everything reëstablished on a little worse than its former basis . If the cabinet of Richmond were transferred to the Federal city , and the North awfully snubbed , at least , and driven back within its old political limits , they would deem it a happy day . It is no wonder , and , if we look at the matter generously , no unpardonable crime . Very excellent people hereabouts remember the many dynasties in which the Southern character has been predominant , and contrast the genial courtesy , the warm and graceful freedom of that region , with what they call ( though I utterly disagree with them ) the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the President . They have a conscientious , though mistaken belief , that the South was driven out of the Union by intolerable wrong on our part , and that we are responsible for having compelled true patriots to love only half their country instead of the whole , and brave soldiers to draw their swords against the Constitution which they would once have died for , - to draw them , too , with a bitterness of animosity which is the only symptom of brotherhood ( since brothers hate each other best ) that any longer exists . They whisper these things with tears in their eyes , and shake their heads , and stoop their poor old shoulders , at the tidings of another and another Northern victory , which , in their opinion , puts farther off the remote , the already impossible chance of a reunion . I am sorry for them , though it is by no means a sorrow without hope . Since the matter has gone so far , there seems to be no way but to go on winning victories , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the expense , probably , of greater trouble , in the present one , than any other people ever voluntarily suffered . We woo the South " as the Lion wooes his bride " ; it is a rough courtship , but perhaps love and a quiet household may come of it at last .

The war can never be allowed to terminate , except in the complete triumph of Northern principles . We hold the event in our own hands , and may choose whether to terminate it by the methods already so successfully used , or by other means equally within our control , and calculated to be still more speedily efficacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We should be sorry to cast a doubt on the Peaceable Man 's loyalty , but he will allow us to say that we consider him premature in his kindly feelings towards traitors and sympathizers with treason . As the author himself says of John Brown , ( and , so applied , we thought it an atrociously cold-blooded dictum , ) " any common-sensible man would feel an intellectual satisfaction in seeing them hanged , were it only for their preposterous miscalculation of possibilities . " There are some degrees of absurdity that put Reason herself into a rage , and affect us like an intolerable crime , - which this Rebellion is , in to the bargain .
