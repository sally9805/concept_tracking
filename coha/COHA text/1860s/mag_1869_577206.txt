they for me , and this is the whole mystery of my friendly relations with them . " On the 1st of February we returned to Pinogana after fourteen days ' absence from this village ; the news of the discovery of the passage , which I caused to be attested before the government attorney by all the Pinogana men who had accompanied me , was received with joy , and we had the pleasure of attending several balls which were given for us during the time that we were obliged to spend awaiting the sailing of a vessel for Panama . On my arrival at Panama I communicated the fortunate result of my exploration to Senor de Gogorza , who heard of it with pleasure , though I well understood that he would have much preferred the existence of a passage by the Punusa . Without losing an instant , I wrote my report and made a map showing the course of the rivers and the road I had followed , which I handed to Seflor de Gogorza , that they might be published immediately , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luded the work for which I had been sought , I returned home ; reached Monteria March 6th , after an absence of two months and a half . Senor de Gogorza , with this discovery and the positive knowledge of a practicable route for an interoceanic canal , went to the United States , where he received , both from the Government at Washington and from persons of influence in commercial circles , a most favorable reception and offers of cooperation in the opening of this great cosmopolitan way of communication . For months I had he " rd no news concerning the Darien business , when on t e 19th of January , 1867 , at two o'clock in the morning , I was aroused , at Monteria , by the same Sr. Atilano del Rio , then prefect of Panama , who told me that an American war steamer awaited me in the port of Cispata , having been sent from Colon on purpose to tring me . Senor del Rio gave me a letter from Senor de Gogorza. , in which he said that he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for carrying into effect the opening of a canal by the Paya passage , but that before presenting this great enterprise to the public , it was decided that a verification of my work was necessary ; that for that purpose two government engineers , Messrs . Robinson and R. E. Holter of the Coast Survey , had been appointed , and that he was waiting for me to go on this new expedition . As when first summoned , so again at this time I abandoned my concerns on the Siun , to attend to this important work , and on the 21st , at 5 r. *r. , I embarked on the gunboat " Saco , " Lient. - Commander Henry Wilson commanding , the courtesy and kindness of whom , as well as of Lieut. - Commander William Whitehead , executive officer , and the other officers , cause me to remember a most agreeable voyage . I had the pleasure of meeting on board Mr. R. E. Holter , one of the engineers who had come to verify my observations , with whom I had long and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the afternoon of the 23d , and had the unhappiness to learn that , one hour before our arrival , Mr. Spooner had embarked with Mr. Robinson , the principal engineer , who had been taken vcry ill with fever , a circumstance which broke up the intended exploration . I learned also that a misunderstanding between Mr. Spooner and Senor de Gogorza had influenced the return of the former to New York , with the intention , as he told several persons , of coming again within a few months for the same purpose , but with a different organization . I returned immediately , and since then have heard nothing about the enterprise , except th't in March of the same year , 1867 , after the return of Mr. Spooner to the United States , the subject was before Congress . For nearly a year past I have been without news of Senor de Gogorza , and // WONDERS OF THE DEEP . as I see that no arrangements have been made for the publication of the report which I gave him on the discovery of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I consider it my duty to publish the present memorandum for the purpose of establishing my right to the discovery , and to serve as a basis for the efforts of those who , animated by liberal ideas of pro* , ress , shall follow up my suggestions and attain to the establishment of a means of interoceanic navigation , which to-day I consider easy , and hope , in the course of a few years , to see in the way of being carried out , if not entirely completed .

" TUE great sea has its mountains and its deep valleys , with forests of weird , waving plants on the former , and , far down in the dark dells , masses of dismal debris , wrecks of vessels , and decaying bodies of men . There lies , half covered with a crust of lime and hideous green slime , an ancient gun shining in sickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled with gold that was picked up amid the snows of the Peruvian Andes , and scattered over all a motley crowd of oddly-shaped shells . The empty skull of an old sea-captain has sunk down close to the broken armor of a huge turtle , and a deadly harpoon rusts and rots by the side of the enormous tooth of a walrus . Still farther down , " in the lower deep of the lowest , " lie countless bales of Indian silks , in which large schools of fish dwell peacefully now ; and over all , the silent currents of the ocean move incessantly to and fro , while millions of jelly fish throng every wave to feed the giant whales , and immense hosts of herring dash frightened through the waters to escape the voracious shark . Not only mountains and valleys , however , break the apparent monotony of the vas* deep , but all that the surface of the earth can present of picturesque beauty or horrible hideousness is repeated below . In one place , the waters foam and the waves break without rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently high to be seen above ; in another , they wash slowly and sadly against a wide desert of white sand . Where lofty mountains rise from the depth to a height not inferior to that of the tallest of Alpine summits , and vast forests of sea-tang clothe them in brilliant green , the sea circles mournfully all around in ceaseless windings , while farther on , where the valley sinks into the very bowels of the earth , and eternal darkness covers all with its mysterious mantle , the waters themselves are hushed arid apparently motionless , as if awe-struck by the unbroken silence and the unfathomable night below . The earth , it has been said , is one vast graveyard , and man can nowhere put down his foot without stepping on the remains of a brother . This is not less true with regard to the ocean . It is an ever-hungry grave , in which millions and millions of once living beings lie buried , and new hosts are added from year to year . It is the stage on which murder and maddest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those cold , unfeeling waters  --  and yet for a good purpose , since it is only through this unceasing destruction and change that life // can be maintained in the crowded world that dwells in the " waters below the earth . " The sea has its lions , its tigers , and wolves , as well as the earth above , its crocodiles and gigantic snakes , which daily sally forth to seek their prey and murder whole races ; it has its medus* and polypi , which spread their nets unceasingly for smaller fry ; while whales , and their kindred , swallow millions of minute beings at a single gulp , swordfish and sea-bears liunt the giants of the lower world , and wretched parasites wait their opportunity to enter the fatty coats of hu , e monsters . Every thing is hunting , chasing , and murdering , but there is heard no merry " Tally Ho I " no warcry encourages the weary combatants ; no groan of pain , no shout of victory ever breaks the dread silence . The battles are fought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict but the splash of foaming waters and the last spasmodic effort of the wounded victim . Can we wonder , then , that from time immemorial the sea has been peopled by the learned and the ignorant alike with marvels of every kind ? It is the good fortune of travellers , and especially of those who " go down to the great deep , " to be either determined that all they have seen must needs be unique , unheard of and marvellous , or disposed to follow the nil admirari doctrine , and to insist that they have never met with any thing which was not perfectly familiar to them already from previous knowledge , or at least very easily accounted for by their superior mind . Vanity induces the former to magnify , self-love teaches the other to diminish all they have seen , and thus littleness of mind unfits both for correct observation and candid reports . The ancients , with their very limited knowledge of the sea and its life , very naturally transferred the features of the world above to that below the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the animals that were familiar to their eyes . There were seahorses and sea-lions , poisonous sea-hares and ravenous sea-wolves , sea-swine , and even sea-locusts . There was the Chilon , with a man 's head , living frugally on nothing but his own viscous humors ; and there was the Balena , not so very like to a whale , and most cruel to its mate . There were those real wonders of the sea , the Dolphins , who swam about with their babies at the breast , and their eyes in their blade-bones , who dug graves for their deceased parents and friends , followed them in funeral procession , and buried them in submarine graveyards out of the way of the fishes . There was that strange fish , the Dies , with two wings and two legs , which in the perfect state lived only for a day . There was the Phoca , another oceanic brute , who was perpetually fighting with his wife until he killed her . Always remaining in the same spot , where he had murdered one wife , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry VIII . to a series of wives , until he either died himself , or found a mate who was a match for him . But these were only the teachings of that despised science , Natural History . Of far greater interest to the nation , and of deeper concern for their future welfare , were the legends of the godlike shepherds , a Proteus , a Nereus , and a Glaucus , who tended the aquatic flocks of Neptune , and were endowed with marvellous powers . We have all seen those classic bas-reliefs , in which the great Poseidon is accompanied by monsters , half-horses , half-fishes , while others wear partly the semblance of men , and blow trumpets made of huge shells with such terrible force , and such fearful sound , that their notes calmed the stormy sea ! These hippocampi , sometimes provided with cloven feet and long tails , and then again covered all over with scales , and of . the color of the sea , were favorite forms with some of the greatest sculptors of antiquity , like Myron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were altogether the offspring of poetic or artistic inspiration* . Naturalists , as well as artists , have been led to think // that extraordinary creatures of somewhat similar shape may have really peopled the seas in ancient times , and that they , like the giants of old , which are now reduced to the moderate proportions of our day , may have dwindled down into the diminutive hippocampi which abound in Southern waters . These little sea-horses , as they are familiarly called , have the perfect form of a horse 's head , with prominent round eyes , and a steep , straight brow , while the gills float in exact imitation of a mane from the proudly-arched neck . They could not have copied the walrus , as that strange , monstrous animal , of which we shall presently . have to say more , lives only in polar regions , to which the ancients did not have access . When the Tritons , on the other hand , were represented in human shape , they belonged , of course , simply to the realm of fables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient authors of the real existence of beings whom they resembled . Demostratus , for instance , relates that such a Triton was still to be seen , imperfectly embalmed , in a temple of Bacehus at Tanagria . It seems that there had been enmity for generations between these strange children of the sea and the good people of Tanagria . One of the Tritons had been in the habit of coming forth every night from the waters to steal the cattle on shore , and all efforts to catch him on the part of the dwellers there had long been in vain . At last they placed a vessel fille* with strong wine on the brow of a steep hill . When the Triton came , according to his custom , he noticed the vase , and was curious to ascertain its contents . He tasted , he liked it , and drank till he fell fast asleep on the edb e of the precipice . During his disturbed slumbers he rolled over and fell from the great height upon the rocks below , where the Tanagrians lay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pausanias saw a smaller Triton at Rome , and from that time the annals of all countries of the world abound with strange legends of uncouth , hornVOL. iii. - 22 ble beings , born and bred in the sea , who entered into ill-fated relations with men , and almost invariably contrived their ruin . The White Lady of Scotland , the Nix or Undine of beautiful German lore , the Merminne of the Netherlands , and the Nech-our Old Nickof the dismal North , are all children of the marine monsters of antiquity . Among the latter , so me were great favorites with poet and priest , and their memory survives to our day . Thus the Ocean itself was represented as the son of the Heavens and the Earth , and the first of that gigantic race of Titans who stormed the abode of the gods , but the only one who did not join in the revolt of Saturn . How the briny deep was made to differ from the vast lakes with sweet water , their religion did not tell ; but the distinction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us that " nine tenths of the waters of the ocean , passing under the earth across dark night , fall in silvery showers upon the bed of the waves , around the earth , and on the back of the seas . One tenth only , to the great injury of the gods , escaping from a lofty rock , forms the waters of the Styx , and by it the Immortals are fond of swearing . " Among the vast offspring of the ocean , again , the Nereids stand foremost by their number and by their beauty . They were all fair young maidens , nearly naked , and are often seen in the frescoes of Pompeii , and elsewhere , in most graceful positions , reclining on the back of sea-horses , or giving drink to thirsty monsters of the deep . It was only when the taste of artists became corrupt , and the f ncy of men ran riot amid Eastern fictions , . that they were represented as ending in fishtails , and as having hair of the color of the sea . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presented by her with three daughters , the Sirens , whom he called Blanche , Harmony , and Virgin Eye ; but , unfortunately , he lost them soon after , when the infuriated Ceres punished them for having allowed the carrying // off of her daughter Proserpina , and changed them into monsters , half women , half birds . The unfortunate maidens fled in despair , and hid themselves in the islands which dot the waters between Sicily and Italy . But even there the curse pursued them still , for the decree had gone forth , that they were to die if ever man should pass them without stopping . Behold , now , the poor metamorphosed beauties straining their sweet voices , and blending them with the softest notes of their instruments , in order to attract hapless seamen , and to draw them into ruin . Surely the ancients felt that sea and land alike are welcome stages for the fatal skill of the coquette ! Only once the sad Sirens were foiled in their attempts to win and to ruin the children of men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their great expedition in search of the Golden Fleece-in reality , a company of daring adventurers , who went to take possession of the gold mines in the Ural Mountains  --  and passed close to the islands on which the wretched sisters were living . They came down to the steep sides of the precipices , they displayed their unequalled charms , and sang their sweetest to cast their spell over all their senses . But Orpheus , who had joined the merry company with his lyre , raised his own sweet voice , and soon they were forced by its wondrous power to listen in their turn , and to let the Argo pass unharmed . Perhaps the godlike nature of the great singer was pleaded in their behalf , for they survived the future ; and it was only when cunning Ulysses used the coarse trick of ifiling the ears of his companions with wax , and thus rendered them insensible to their enchantments , that they paid the penalty , and were changed into rocks . Even then one of them survived ; for the compassionate waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surface , and she became fair Naples , the city of magic beauty , where so many have died from over-enjoyment , obeying literally the ancient saying : Vedi Yapoli e poi muon ! Pliny seems still to have been in doubt as to the real existence of these marine monsters ; at least , he defends himself against the suspicion of believing in them with an earnestness which goes far to prove the lingering doubt . " I do not believe in sirens , " he says in his book on birds , " although Dino , father of Clearchus , a famous author , affirms that they exist in India and tempt men by their song , in order to tear them in pieces when they are asleep . " In another place , again , he believes them to have been real fish , which recalled , , in a vague manner , the features of human beings , and states that several such had been taken on the coasts of GauL The assertion is , strangely enough , supported by later evidence ; for other portions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithfully repeated the legend , and pointed to actual beings in the sea as proof of their truth . Have not even the Arabs-who either ignore the sea altogether , or hate it as cursed by their great prophet-their weird beings , half men and half ostriches , who live on desolate islands , and devour the bodies of shipwrecked mariners brought to their rocks by the friendly waves ? Near Rosetta and Alexandria , in Egypt , the waters are peopled with still stranger creatures , poetically called the Fathers of the Fair , who come only on shore for peaceful purposes , walk quietly about to enjoy the sweet air of heaven and the perfumes of flowers , and then return reluctantly to their dark homes in the great deep . A hundred of them were once captured , but they uttered such very sad sighs and unbearable groanings , that the hunters released , them , and saw them plunge with delight into the cool waters . The Old Man of the Sea is familiar to all our readers through the Arabian Nights ; but it is less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then promised a good harvest to the Syrians ; the people were so grateful to him for his benevolence , that they caught him once and married him , fishtail and all , to a fair daughter of the land . The monster was well content , // but not so the farmers , for his happy influence had left him as soon as he had found his master in his wife . Other Arabic authors tell us even the religion of one of those marine beings ; he is called by them the Old Jew , and appears on the night preceding the Sabbath , with his white hair and shaggy coat , on the surface of the Mediterranean , and remains there , swimming about , plunging , and jumping high , and following the vessels as they pass near his home , till the Sabbath is over , and he sinks once more down under the waters . These strange beings , reported to have been found or heard of with at least as much accuracy and as frequently as the Sea Serpent of our days , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill-starred , God-forsaken dwellers in the kingdom of waters , the " Merman bold , sitting alone , Singing alone Under the sea , With a crown of gold , On a throne ; And the mermaid fair , Singing alone , combing her hair , Under the sea , In a golden cnn With a comb of pearl , On a throne . " For a time Christian authors loved to revive the fables of pagan antiquity , or unconsciously repeated the weird fancies of older nations . Soon , however , certain features appear in their accounts which show that they were either re-* ports of real discoveries of marine monsters , dressed up , perhaps , in somewhat fanciful colors , or at least new inventions in harmony with the spirit of the age . The mermen soon cease to be mere monstrosities ; they appear in a form resembling human beings , often scarcely to be distinguished from the people near whom they live , whence follows more frequent intercourse and a closer intimacy between the two races . One merman , found on the outermost point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still having been in part a fish ; but Theodore of Gaza already describes the mermaid , of which he saw several cast ashore on the coast of Greece , as fair and graceful ; one of them he assisted in reaching the water , and immediately she plunged into the waves and was seen no more . Other authors , of such high repute that even the great Scaliger may be mentioned among them , tell of such wondrous beings , which they saw themselves or heard of through trustworthy friends . These accounts were , of course , valued only in proportion to the wonder they excited , and added nothing to our actual knowledge of the dwellers in the waters . They led , on the contrary , to new errors , and much amusement might be derived from the precepts given to unlucky sailors who should fall in with such sirens . They were advised to cast bottles into the sea , with which the monsters would play long enough to give them time to escape ; to stop their ears carefully with wax and oakum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The great Cabot , so intimately connected with the history of our continent , furnished the officers of the first vessel that ever attempted the voyage to the fantastic Cathay of those days , with a set of curious instructions . He recommended that prayers should be held twice every day , and all inventions of the Evil One , like dice , cards , and backgammon , should be strictly prohibited . By the side of such excellent sugges* ' tions are some of more doubtful morality . Thus he enjoins upon the officers to attract the natives of foreign lands , to bring them on board ship , and there to make them drunk with beer and wine till they had revealed all the secrets of their hearts . The rules contain at the end a recommendation " to take good care against certain creatures which , with the heads of men and the tails of fishes , swim about in the fords and bays armed with bow and arrows , and feed upon human flesh . " The dark North , with its misty , murky atmosphere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superstitions , has its mermen above all others . They are mostly seen when fearful tempests threaten destruction ' or sudden storms // bring shipwreck to vessel and sailors alike . It is but here and there that they are painted in softer colors . In one of the legends , a famous giant of the seas , called Rosmer , carries off a Danish maiden of great beauty ; she has to live with him in a great mountain , to which he comes every now and then from his home in the waters . Her brother , who had sallied forth to find her and to rescue her , lands at the desert rock , and is at first in great danger of being slain and devoured by the terrible monster* He succeeds , however , in pacifying the merman , and serves him faithfully for many years . At last he obtains leave to return home , and receives , as reward for his services , a large box filled with gold and precious stones . The giant even condescends to carry the box himself on board the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out all the treasures , and then aoncealed herself in the box , from which she comes forth as soon as the ship has reached the high seas . It may readily be imagined that mariners who set out on long voyages to distant , unknown lands , with their minds filled with such images and marvellous stories , were ready to see sirens and other wonders of the deep to their hearts ' content . Christopher Columbus even , when sailing along the coast of St. Domingo , met with three sirens , who were dancing on the water . They had , however , no sweet songs with which to allure him , and their silence , combined with their lack of beauty , made him think that they probably " regretted their absence from Greece . " There can be little doubt that his sirens were Manatees , huge monsters so called because they carry their young with their flappers , or finlike hands , and give them suck on the breast - relations of the great Dugong of India , the only animal yet known that grazes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange power of suspending itself steadily in the water , and its jaws are bent in such a curious manner that the mouth is nearly vertical , by which means it is enabled to feed upon the sea-weeds down in the deep , very much as a cow does upon the herbage in the bright sunlight above . The Manatees serve to frighten the children of African slaves even now , when they suddenly rise lil* " spirits from the vasty deep , " their large , gentle eyes looking anxiously around , and their young clasped tenderly to their bosom  --  a tisvorite position of theirs , which has earned them , with Spanish colonists , the name of Fish-Women . The poor Brazilian natives , who still cherish the traditions of their forefathers , fondly believe in the existence of an immense lake in th' interior which contains an enormous treasure , guarded and watched over by a siren whom they call the Mai das Aguas . They also believe still in the accounts given by early discoverers of strange beings met in their waters . Did not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he came near our own continent , see a woman swimming gracefully near the vessel l 11cr eyes were large , beautiful , and full of expression , although rather round , the nose and ears well made , and the hair long and soft , but of sea-green color . 1-us heart was near giving way to all these charms , when thc strange being suddenly turned over , and showed to her disconcerted admirer a forked fish-tail ! Among South American Indians , it seems , tales of mermen are a favorite subject , though here and there these marine monsters are dreaded with instinctive abhorrence . Moravian missionaries have sent home strange reports of these superstitions , and yet found themselves unable , in their desire to honor the truth and to avoid misstatements , to deny positively all ground for these traditions . For not only the natives , but the ministers and agents of the pious Brethren themselves , firmly believed that they had met with men and women who lived in the water . They furnished statements , apparently made in full earnest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beings with human faces and long hair rise suddenly from the water , and that the urgent intercession of the Indians // alone had kept them from killing the supernatural beings . The natives looked upon them with superstitious awe , and insisted upon it that to kill one of them would be simply to bring dire calamities upon their settlements and the whole race . It must be presumed that we meet here with stray members of those aquatic tribes of Indians who live actually more in the water than on land . Martius , and other travellers , down to our day , tell us that the Indians who dwell near the upper branches of the Paraguay , the *aranhao , and other large rivers , remain for hours and hours in the water , and are such expert swimmers that they defy the most powerful current , and dive like water-fowl . A small bundle of leafstalks taken from the Buriti palm-tree is all they use ordinarily for their support ; at other times they seize an oar , hold it between their feet , and use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , holding their weapons in their muscular arms ; or they leap with incredible agility upon a tree floating along on the swollen stream , sit down on it astride , and thus cross in a few minutes the most rapid current . No cayman or aquatic animal is safe from them , and they fight and defeat the huge capyvara , and the largest serpent , with great courage . They fear literally nothing except the Minho*as , a fabulous creature which is said to live in the rivers and still waters of Equatorial Brazil , and which naturalists believe to be either a giant eel endowed with powerful teeth , or perhaps a large variety of the famous gymnotus with its galvanic battery . These Canoeiros , as the Water-Indians are called , are true Ishmaelites ; they are at war with all the other tribes , and are therefore hunted down like wild beasts ; they have no home and no country of their own , and hence they may very well have given rise to the fabulous reports of mermen still rife among the credulous Indians of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and superstition still has its strong hold on the minds of the masses , gruesome stories are told in the long winter nights of the Nixen , who dwell in the waters near the coast , in crystal-clear rivers , under the dark shadow of ancient trees , and in bright , bubbling wells in half-hidden glens . They are the sirens of the sunny South , and even here the ancient curse seems to follow the illfated race . For here , also , they are condemned to expiate some great and grievous sin committed by their forefathers , and to suffer long and miserably . As the whole creation groaneth , however , these sorrowful beings also yearn to be released , and of this longing many a touching tale is told in German legends . Thus one of them tells us , that the children of a Protestant minister were once playing on the banks of a river , when they saw a Nix rise from the waters , who , thinking himself unobserved , began to sing and to play on a strange , but ineffably sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once rushed upon him and reproached him for his merriment , adding that as he was nothing but a condemned sinner , he had much better weep over his eternal wretchedness . The poor water-sprite , taken by surprise and distressed beyond measure , broke into tears ; and the youthful tyrants , delighted with their success , went home to tell their father what had happened . But they were badly received here , and told that they had acted very wrongly and must return at once and comfort the poor being whom they had so grievously afflicted . They ran back , and as soon as they saw the Nix they cried out to him not to weep any longer , since their father had said that the Lord had died even for him , and he also might hope to be forgiven hereafter . Thereupon the poor Nix dried his tears , recovered his cheerfulness , and played with them all day long . Holland , with its wondrous bulwarks and its lifelong conflict with the sea , abounds naturally in stories of every kind , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they meet the intrepid sailor out on the high sea and sing of his joyous return , or // warn him of his approaching end ; at other times they come on shore , make themselves useful in a thousand ways , and vanish only when they are ill treated or laughed at . There is hardly a town on the seacoast which has not its own legend of this kind ; but generally the men are less intercsting than the maiden , since the latter are prophets and play a prominent part in the sad history of that country . Such was the mermaid that once frequented the waters near Zevenbergen , a fortitied town with massive walls and lofty towers , in which dwelt thousands of opulent citizens with their wives and children . But the people were as wicked as they were rich , and professed to believe neither in heaven nor hell . One fine day the siren appeared in company with a sister mermaid , and with solemn , tearful voice both began to sing : " Zevenbergen must perish , And the tower of Lobbekens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inhabitants continued their riotous living and sinful profanity . In a dark November night of the same year a fearful tempest arose ; the wind blew from the northwest , and with such terrific force that the dykes gave way under the overwhelming pressure of the waters , and the Saint Elisabeth , as the inundation was called , overwhelmed not less than seventy-two towns and villages . Among these was the unfortunate town of Zevenbergen , and so thorough was its destruction in the deep waters , that , when the morning broke , and people came from . a distance in boats , they saw far beneath them the ruins of houses , and nothing standing but the one lofty tower of Lobbekens . Thus the prophecy of the mermaid had become true . Fortunately , man has triumphed over the evil prophet and the clement alike . By an immense outlay of capital and the incessant labor of long years , the whole vast region has been once more laid dry , and from the midst of polders , or dyked meadows of surpassing fertility , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiser than the doomed village of former days . Holland is also the land which has originated the very peculiar faith in legends of sea-knights and sea-bishops , some of whom were captured from time to time and exhibited in the large cities . They were found afterwards in all the northern seas , and the works of those ages , down to the latter part of the sixteenth century , contain generally one or two so-called faithful likenesses of these very curious monsters of the deep . In 1305 already a sea-knight was caught out in the open sea to the north of Dockum , and carried from town to town ; his fair appearance , and especially the complete suit of armor which he wore , excited universal admiration ; but he died , unfortunately , in the third week , at Dockum . A work of great scientific merit , and published as late as 1534 , contains an engraving representing a sea-monk , whom the author , Rondelet , heard of in Norway , where it had been taken after a fearful tempest . It has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bald , smooth bead , the cowl of a monk hanging over the shoulders , two long fins instead of arms , and a body ending in a huge double-fluked tail . Other monks of the same kind appear in similar works , sometimes wearing a bishop 's habit and mitre , and one of them is reported to have been sent in 1433 from the Baltic , where he was capturdd , to the king of Poland . The poor creature , however , refused steadfastly to utter a sound or to take any food ; the king , moved with compassion , ordered him to be carried back to the sea , and the monster no sooner saw his own element than he gave signs of exuberant joy , leaped into the water and was never seen again . It may be added , that the Protestants made great capital out of these marine dignitaries of the church , and hence gave rise to the suspicion that the whole nice of sea-monks and sea-bishops was artistically produced as a quaint revenge which the Reformation took on the persecuting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought , but , as the proverb has it , // that there is no smoke without fire , so here also , these countless and persistent traditions contain their grain of truth , which has been only half hid in a bushel of falsehoods . The fact is , that these fables could never have been invented , much less authenticated , even after the imperfect manner of early ages , if there were not certain animals living in the great deep which possess sufficient likeness to the human form to deceive careless and superstitious observers . If there are no real tritons and sirens to be met with in our waters , such as we see in ancient sculptures , or the coats of arms of noble families , there are at least seals arid walrus , sea-lions and sea-cows , and similar monsters , whose faces and gestures as seen on the surface of the waters recall forcibly the features and movements of men . Unscrupulous cheats have occasionally taken great pains to manufacture actual sirens , and their remains are to this day carefully preserved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sirens of Leyden and the Hague . Nor is our own time exempt from these attempts to profit by the credulity of men . At the beginning of this century , a crafty fisherman on the coast of India skilfully joined the body of an ape to the lower part of a large fish , and dressed up the whole affair so cleverly , that even experienced men were taken in , and bestowed much time and long research upon the extraordinary being . As the inventor attributed , moreover , healing powers to the touch of the siren , he was soon overrun , and could , after a short time , retire upon a competency . An European charlatan purchased the marine monster at a high price , and exhibited it in England and on the Continent . He met with great success for a time ; then he and his siren were forgotten , only , however , to revive more brilliantly than ever in the hands of the master of his art , our own great Barnum . Another siren was , a couple of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor was it , in this case , a mere mummy that was shown , but a living mermaid not un attractive in appearance , who discreetly plunged her fish-tail into the waters of a huge basin , and held the classic mirror and comb in her hands . At last public sympathy was aroused by some benevolent Quakers ; an investigation was ordered by the authorities , and it was found that the poor woman had been forced for years to spend her days in the water , with an imitation fish-skin sewed on to her body ! There is , however , quite enough that is truly marvellous in some of the greater denizens of the deep , to engage our interest , and to find in them the originals of the fabled teings of whom we have spoken , without resorting to such gross and cruel deception . Pliny already speaks of a sea-elephant , so called at first , no doubt , mainly on account of his two enormous teeth , and of the peculiar shape of his head , which resembles somewhat the trunk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been known to the Norwegian Olaus Magnus , who gives a most extraordinary description of the manner in which they were captured . " Sometimes , " he says , " they fell asleep on the rocky coast , and then the fishermen went quickly to work , raising the fat along their tails , and attaching to it strong ropes , which they fastened to rocks and trees on the shore . Then they waked up the huge animal by throwing stones at it with a sling , and compelled it to return into the water , leaving its skin behind ! " At present , the true sea-elephant is found only in the Antarctic Ocean . On the confines of that world of ice , as far as the eye can reach , there appears nothing in sight but vast masses of ice , thrown in apparent disorder upon the immense plain , with here and there a colossal block rising on high and mimicking the shape of a great palace , with its walls and ramparts , towers and turrets , battlements and colonnades . Before these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and down on the dusky waters , and gray mists hang from their sides , and break with their tatters and fragments the dreary prospect . At // rare times the sun breaks through the dense fog , and then the whole world of ice begins to glitter and glare in the bright rays , and enchanted scenes dazzle the eye . Here is a snow landscape , with hamlets and trees ; the larger blocks of ice resembling saow-covered houses , and the torn and tarnished masses appearing not unlike trees bending under the weight of hoarfrost , or bushes feathered with light crystals . The whole enchanted city , with its narrow canals , is buried in absolute stillness ; gulls fly silently across the clear air , penguins rise and dive again in utter quiet , and even the sea-elephants lie voiceless , like colossal watchdogs , on the steps of the palaces . Only the low , mournful blowing of a whale , who sends up his airy fountain of foam , breaks occasionally upon the fearful silence of this magnificent city of ice . In these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monster not unfrequently thirty feet long , and measuring over sixteen feet in circumference ! His powerful teeth are formidable enough in appearance , and above them he raises , when he is roused to anger , his inflated trunk , which ordinarily hangs loosely over the upper lip . His whole body is covered with stiff shining hair , and underneath his fur coat he has a layer of fat at least a foot thick , which protects him effectually against the terrible cold of the polar regions . The two awkward feet , mere stumps encased in fin-like coverings , are of little avail to the giant when he moves on firm land ; after a few yards , he begins to groan and to rest , while the whole huge body shakes as if it were one vast mass of jelly-like fat . Here he falls an easy victim to the sailors , who come in search of his ivory and his oil ; they walk fearlessly through the thick crowds , and knock them over by a single blow on the nose . The giant opens his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he can not move , he is virtually helpless . Very different are , however , his motions in his own element ; as soon as he is under water , he swims with amazing rapidity , turns and twists like an eel , and is thus enabled to catch not only swift fish and sepias , but even the web-footed penguins . He must find it difficult at times , to provide his enormous body with sufficient food , for he swallows masses of tangled sea-tang , and large stones have been found in his stomach , to the number of twelve . When he wishes to sleep , he floats on the surface , and is rocked and cradled by the waves of the ocean . What has , in all probability , led to their being taken for human beings by credulous and superstitious mariners of early ages , is the beauty of their eye , and the deep feeling they manifest at critical times . They not only never attack men , but , unlike the sympathetic seals , they also abandon their wounded companions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufferings and their agony . When they are mortally wounded , they drag themselves painfully inland , and hide behind a large rock to die in peace and unseen by others . If they are prevented from thus retiring , they shed tears , as they also weep bitterly when they are illtreated by cruel sailors . Very different in temper is the walrus , another of the great monsters of the deep , who , although by nature as gentle and peaceful as the sea-elephant , has become bitter and fierce by his constant warfare with man . It is the true type of the polar North : as all nature here is buried in sad , deathlike silence for several months , so the walrus also sleeps for the same time , deprived of all power and energy , while the fierce tempests and terrible ice-drifts of those regions are represented by their wild passions . They fight with indomitable courage for the fairest among the females , and many a bold knight among them leaves his life in the lists of the grim tournament . They defend their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strength that lies in union . Par up in the coldest ice regions of the Arctic seas they assemble ' in crowds of two thousand , and when their guards h'ivc been posted , they // begin their sports in the half-frozen waters . They splash and splatter as they leap frantically or plunge . their huge bodies into the foaming waves , and the noise they thus make , together with the trumpeting of their wideopened nostrils , and the mournful howl of their repulsive voice , fill the air with a stunning , confusing roar . Their appearance is in keeping with the whole scene : black heads , with red , staring eyes of great size , a broad-lipped , swollen mouth , and enormous beard , each hair of the thickness of a straw , adorned with snow-white teeth more than two feet long , and colossal , shapeless bodies , half horse and half whale , but weighing at times not less than three thousand pounds-surely nothing more was needed to strike terror into the hearts of ignorant seamen , and to lead to fancies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Far greater , however , is the resemblance which certain varieties of seals bear to the human form . Their head , perfectly round and bald , their large bright eyes full of intelligence and tender feelings , their flail beard on both sides of the face , and their broad shoulders , give to the upper part of their body a startling likeness , such as , in the foggy atmosphere of the northern seas , and with a predisposition to see what people expected to see , may very well have led to a sincere conviction that they were human beings . To this must be added their merry , playful disposition , and the peculiar manner in which they hold themselves almost perfectly upright when gambolling in the water . Naturally harmless , and even timid , they have a habit of following the small boats that go on shore , and of observing attentively all that is done ; and if the crew remains longer at one and the same place , they become familiar , and fond of their company . They learn to know the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , in Corsica , flocks of them follow the fishing-boats , and modestly content themselves with the fish rejected after the nets have been hauled in . There can be little doubt that this intimacy has given rise to an account , given by Pliny , of a scene daily enacted near the town of Mines , in southern France ; and as here truth and fiction meet in striking relation to each other , we insert the words of the great naturalist : " At a certain period of the year a prodigious number of mullets make their way to the sea through the narrow mouth of a swamp called Latera . These fish choose the moment of the incoming tide , which prevents the stretching out of nets and the taking them in vast quantities . By a similar instinct they turn at once toward the open sea , and hasten to escape from the only place in which they are liable to be caught . The inhabitants , who know the period of this mi , , ration , and enjoy the pleasure of the sport , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry aloud : Simo ! Simo ! , Immediately the dolphins know that they are needed . The north wind carries the sound of the voice to them . But whatever time it may be , these faithful allies never fail to appear at once . One might imagine it was an army , which instantly takes up its position in the opening where the action is to take place . They close the outlet to the mullets , who take fright , and throw themselves into shallow water . Then the fishermen surround them with their nets . But the mullets , with wonderful agility , leap over them . Now the dolphins fall upon them , and , content for the moment with havin* killed them , wait to devour them when the victory is assured . The action goes on , and , pressing the enemy closer and closer , the dolphins allow themselves to be imprisoned with the mullets , and , in order not to frighten them into desperate acts , they glide stealthily between the boats , the nets , and the swimming fishermen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken , they devour those they have killed . But knowing that they have labored hard enough to deserve more than a single day 's wages , they reappear on the morrow , and not only receive as many fish as they desire , but are fed with bread soaked in wine ! " The talents of the seal are manifold , from the agility which he displays in catching fish for his master , to the capacity he has shown in learning actually to speak . More than one seal ha* been taught to utter distinctly the word Papa , and several animals of the kind are reported to have gone even beyond , and to have pronounced several words at a time . Nor must their love of music be forgotten , which is so great that they will rise from the ' water and remain // Mar. nearly standing upright as long as the instrument is played , to which they listen with unmistakable pleasure . It is not so very long since one of this remarkable race came every day for six weeks from the waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divan of a custom-house officer in Smyr*ia . The latter had tamed her , and placed a few rough planks at the distance of about three feet from the water 's edge under his couch , and on these boards the seal loved to rest for several hours , giving vent to her delight , oddly enough , in a profusion of sighs like those of a suffering man . She ate readily the rice and the bread which were offered her , though she seemed to have some trouble in softening the former sufficiently to swallow it with ease . After an absence of several days , the affectionate creature reappeared with a young one under the arm , but a month later she plunged one day , frightened , into the water , and was never seen again . Nearly about the same time , another seal appeared suddenly in the very midst of the port of Constantinople , undisturbed by the number of caiques dashing to and fro , and the noise of a thousand vessels with their crews and their passengers . One day the boat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with wine for the ambassador . A drunken sailor was sitting astride on the cask , and singing boisterously , when all of a sudden the seal raised himself out of the water , seized the sailor with his left arm , and threw himself with his prey back into the waves . He reappeared at some distance , still holding the man under his fin , as if wishing to display his agility , and then san*k once more , leaving the frightened , sobered sailor , to make his way back to the boat . Surely , nothing more than one such occurrence was needed to give rise to the many romances of former ages ; if the same , even , hadhappened in earlier days , the seal would have been a beautiful Kereid , who , having conceived a passion for the hapless sailor , had risen to take him down to her palace under the waves .
