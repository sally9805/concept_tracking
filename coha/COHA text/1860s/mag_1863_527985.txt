MR . BUCKLE AS A THINKER . THE recent death of Henry Thomas Buckle calls a new attention to his published works . Pathetic it will seem to all that he should he cut off in the midst of labors so large , so assiduous and adventurous ; and there are few who will not feel inclined to make up , as it were , to his memory for this untimely interruption of his pursuits , by assigning the highest possible value to his actual performance . Additional strength will be given to these dispositions by the impressions of his personal character . This was , indeed , such as to conciliate the utmost good-will . If we except occasional touches of self- complacency , which betray , perhaps , a trifling foible , it may be said that everything is pleasing which is known concerning him . His devotion , welluigh heroic , to scholarly aims ; his quiet studiousness ; his filial virtue ; his genial sociability , graced by , and gracing , the selfsupporting habit of his soul ; his intrepidity of intellect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the absence , too , from works so incisive , of a single trace of truculence : all this will now be remembered ; and those are unamiable persons , in whom the remembrance does not breed a desire to believe him as great in thought as he was brave , as prosperous in labor as he was persevering . But however it may be with others , certainly he who has undertaken the duties of a scholar must not yield too readily to these amiable wishes . He , as a sworn soldier of Truth , stands sacredly bound to // be as free from favor as from fear , and to follow steadily wherever the standards of his imperial mistress lead him on . And so performing his lawful service , he may bear in mind that at last the interests of Truth are those of every soul , be it of them that we number with the dead , or that are still reckoned among these that we greet as living . Let us not be petty in our kindness . Over the fresh grave of a scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respects more the scope of every man 's nature than the limited measure of any man 's performance , and sides bravely with the soul of the departed , even though it be against his fame . Who would not choose this for himself ? Who would not whisper from his grave , " My personal weaknesses let those spare who can ; my work do not praise , but judge ; and never think in behalf of my mortal fame to lower those stars that my spirit would look up to yet and forever " ? As a man and scholar , Mr. Buckle needs no forbearance ; and men must commend him , Were it only in justice to themselves . Such intellectual courage , such personal purity , such devotion to ideal aims , such a clean separation of boldness from bitterness , - in thought , no blade more trenchant , in feeling , no heart more human ; - when these miss their honor and their praise , then will men have forgotten how to estimate fine qualities . Meanwhile , as a thinker , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here we are to forget whether he be living or dead , and whether his personal traits were delightful or disagreeable . Here there is but one question , and that is the question of truth . And as a thinker , I can say nothing less than that Mr. Buckle signally failed . His fundamental conceptions , upon which reposes the whole edifice of his labor , are sciolistic assumptions caught up in his youth from Auguste Comte and other oneeyed seers of modern France ; his generalization , multitudinous and imposing , is often of the card-castle description , and tumbles at the touch of an inquisitive finger ; and his cobweb logic , spun chiefly out of his wishes rather than his understanding , is indeed facile and ingenious , but of a strength to hold only flies . Such , at any rate , is the judgment passed upon him in the present paper ; and if it is stated roundly , the critic can be held all the better to its justification , and the more freely condemned , should these charges not be sustained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the larger processes of reasoning the failure of Mr. Buckle , according to the judgment here given , is complete , it is freely admitted that as a writer and man of letters he has claims not only to respect , but even to admiration . His mental fertility is remarkable , his memory marvellous , his reading immense , his mind discursive and agile , his style pellucid as water and often vigorous , while his subordinate conceptions are always ingenious and frequently valuable . Besides this , he is a genuine enthusiast , and sees before him that El Dorado of the understanding where uolden knowledge shall lie yellow on all the hills and yellow under every footfall , - where the very peasant shall have princely wealth , and no man shall need say to another , " Give me of thy wisdom . " It is this same element of romantic expectation which stretches a broad and shining margin about the spacious page of Bacon ; it is this which wreathes a new fascination around the royal brow of Raleigh ; it is this , in part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I-Iakluyt ; and the grace of it is that which we often miss in coming from ancient to modern literature . Better it is , too , than much erudition and many " proprieties " of thought ; and one may note it as curious , that Mr. Buckle , seeking to disparage imagination , should have written a book whose most winning and enduring charm is the appeal to imagination it makes . Moreover , he is an enthusiast in behalf of just that which is distinctively modern : he is a white flame of precisely those heats which smoulder now in the duller breast of the // world in general ; he worships at all the pet shrines ; he expresses the peculiar loves and hatreds of the time . Who is so devout a heliever in free speech and free trade and the let-alone policy in government , and the coming of the Millennium hy steam ? Who prostrates himself with such unfeigned adoration before the great god , " State-of-Society , " or so mutters , for a mystic O 'm , the word " Law " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole ill of the world to just those things which we now all agree to detest , - to theological persecution , higotry , superstition , and infidelity to Isaac Newton ! In fine , the recent lessons of that great schoolboy , the world , or those over which the said youth now is poring or idling or hlubbering , Mr. Buckle has not only got hy heart , not only recites them capitally , but believes with assurance that they are the sole lessons worth learning in any time and all the inevitable partialities of the text-book , all the errors and ad captandum statements with which its truth is associated , he takes with such implicit faith , and believes in so confidently as part and parcel of our superiority to all other times , that the effect upon most of us can not be otherwise than delectable . Unhappily , the text-book in which he studied these fine lessons chanced to be the French edition , and , above all , the particular compilation of Auguste Comte , - Comte , the one-eyed Polyphemus of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devourer of the finer races in thought , feeding his maw upon the beautiful offspring of the highest intelligence , whom the Olympians love . Therefore it befell that our eager and credulous scholar unlearned quite as much as he learned , acquiring the wisdoms of our time in the crudest and most liberal cornmixture with its unwisdoms . And thus , though his house is laboriously put together , yet it is built upon the sand ; and though his bark has much good timber , and is well modelled for speed , yet its keel is wholly rotten , so that whosoever puts to sea therein will sail far more swiftly to bottom than to port . And precisely this , in lieu of all else , it is my present purpose to show : that the keel of his craft is unsound , - that his fundamental notions are fundamental falsities , such as no thinker can fall into without discredit to his powers of thought . Fortunately , he has begun by stating and arguing these ; so that there can be no question either what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support them . The foundation-timber of Mr. Buckle 's work consists of three pieces , or propositions , two of which take the form of denial . First , he denies that there is in man anything of the nature of Free-Will , and attributes the belief in it to vulgar and childish ignorance . Secondly , and in support of the primary negation , he denies that there is any oracle in man 's bosom ,  --  that his spirit has any knowledge of itself or of the relationships it sustains : in other words , denies the validity of Consciousness . Thirdly and lastly , he attempts to show that all actions of individuals originate not in themselves , but result from a law working in the general and indistinguishable lump of society , - from laws of like nature with that which preserves the balance of the sexes ; so that no man has more to do with his own deed than the mother in determining whether her child shall be male or female . By the two former statements man is stripped of all the grander prerogatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed as freight , whether dead or alive it were hard to say , in the hold of the self-steering ship , " Society . " These propositions and the reasons , or unreasons , by which they are supported , we will examine in order . 1 . Free-Will . The question of free-will has at sundry times and seasons , and by champions many and furious , been disputed , till the ground about it is all beaten into blinding dust , wherein no reasonable man can now desire to cloud his eves and clog his lungs . It is , indeed , one of the cheerful signs of our times , that there is a growing relish for clear air and open skies , a growing indisposition to mingle // in old and profitless controversies . It commonly happens in such controversies , as it undoubtedly has happened in the dispute about free-will , that both parties have been trying to pull up Life or Spirit by the roots , and make a show , is la Barnum , of all its secrets . The enterprise was zealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are strict and jealous limits to the degree in which man 's mind can become an object to itself . By silent consciousness , by an action of reason and imagination sympathetic with pure inward life , man may feel far down into the sweet , awful depths and mysteries of his being ; and the results of this inward intimation are * iven in the great poems , the great art and divine philosophy of all time , and in the commanding beliefs of mankind ; but so soon as one begins to come to his own existence as an outsider and stranger , and attempts to bear away its secret , so soon he begins to be balked . Mr. Buckle , however , has assumed in a summary and authoritative way to settle this question of free-will ; and , without entering into the dust and suffocation of the 01 ( 1 interminable dispute , we may follow him far enough to see whether he has thrown any light upon the matter , or has only thrown light upon his own powers as a thinker . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an attempt to identify it with the notion of Chance in physics . The notion of Chance , he says , is the same with that of Free-Will the doctrine of Necessary Connection with the dogma of Predestination . This statement has certainly an imposing air . But consider it . To assert the identity of chance and free-will is but another way of saying that pure freedom is one and the same with absolute lawlessness ,  --  that where freedom exists , law , order , reason do not . If this be a misconception , as it surely is a total and fatal misconception , of the nature of freedom , then does the statement of our author , with all that rests upon it , fall instantly and utterly to the ground . It is a misconccption . Freedom and lawlessness are not the same . To make this finally clear , let us at once give the argument the widest possible scope ; since the largest way of looking at the matter , as indeed it often happens , will prove also the nearest and simplest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since there is , undoubtedly , origination somewhere . Freely , too , it must arise , for there is nothing behind it to bring it under constraint : indeed , all origination is by its nature free . But our philosopher tells us that wherever there is a pure and free origination of will , there is lawlessness , caprice , chance . The universe , therefore , should be a scene , not of absolute order , but of absolute disorder ; and since it is not such , we have nothing for it but to say that either the logic of the universe , or that of Mr. Buckle , is very much awry . In the universe , Will freely originates , but forever in unison with divine Reason and the result is at once pure necessity and pure freedom : for these , if both be , as we say , absolutelypure , are one and the same . A coercing necessity is impure , for it is at war with that to which it applies ; only a necessity in sweetest affinity with that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is , of course , identical with the highest and divinest freedom . And here we approach the solution of our problem , so far as it can be solved . Freedom and free-will exist only in virtue of reason , only in connection with the rational soul . In a rough account of man , and leaving out of sight all that is not strictly relevant to the present point , we discriminate in him two natures . One of these comprises the whole body of organic desires and energies , with all that kind of intellect by which one perceives the relation of things to his selfish wishes . By this nature , man is a selfish and intellectual animal ; a polyp with arms that go round the world ; a sponge with eyes and energies and delights ; a cunning ego , to whom all outside of himself is but for a prey . But aloft over this , and constituting the second nature , into whose // kingdom one should be born as by a seeon4 birth , is the sovereign eye and soul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creating in man 's bosom an ideal , redeeming him out of his littleness , bringing him into fellowship with Eternal Truth , and making him universal . Now between these two natures there is , for there must be , a mediating term , a power by which man enacts reason , and causes doing to accord with seeing . This is will , and it must , from its very nature , be free for to say that it is a mere representative of the major force in desire is simply to say that it does not exist . A mediation without freedom in the mediator is something worse than the mediation of Ilolland between England and the United States in the dispute concerning the NorthEast Boundary . So far , now , as the sovereign law and benefaction of the higher nature , through a perfect mediation of the will , descends upon the lower , so far man enters into free alliance with that which is sovereign in the universe , and is himself established in perfected freedom . The right action of free-will is , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the great harmonies of the world , by this loyalty to the universal reason which alone makes one free , it must be evident that the order of the world is graced and supported rather than assailed . But how if free-will fail of its highest function ? Must not the order of the world then suffer ? Not a whit . Universal Reason prevails , but in two diverse ways : she may either be felt as a mere Force or Fate , or she may be recognized and loved and obeyed as an Authority . Wherever the rational soul , her oracle , is given , there she proffers the privilege of knowing her only as a divine authority ,  - -  of free loyalty , of honorable citizenship in her domains . But to those who refuse this privilege she appears as fate ; and though their honor is lost , hers is not for the order of the world continues to be vindicated . The just and faithful citizen , who of his own election obeys the laws , illustrates in one way the order of society and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitentiary illustrates the order of society and the supremacy of moral law in quite another way . But order and law are illustrated by both , though in ways so very different . So one may refuse to make reason a free necessity in his own bosom ; but then the constable of the universe speedily taps him upon the shoulder , and law is honored , though he is disgraced . Now Mr. Buckle supposed that order in the world and in history could be obtained only by sacrificing the freedom of the individual ; and that he so supposed determines his own rank as a thinker . There is no second question to be asked concerning a candidate for the degree of master in philosophy who begins by making this mistake . But does some one , unwilling so soon to quit the point , require of me to explain how will can originate innian ? My only answer is , I do not know . Does the questioner know how motion originates in the universe ? It does or did originate ; science is clear in assigning a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system : can you find its origin in aught but the self-activity of Spirit , whose modus operandi no man can explain ? All origination is inscrutable ; the plummet of understanding can not sound it ; but wherefore may not one sleep as sweetly , knowing that the wondrous fact is near at hand , in the bosoms of his contemporaries and in his own being , as if it were pushed well out of sight into the depths of primeval time ? To my mind , there is something thoroughly weak and ridiculous in the way that Comte and his company run away from the Absolute and Inexplicable , fearing only its nearness ; like a child who is quite willing there should be bears at the North Pole , but would lie awake of nights , if tie thought the re were one in the nearest wood . And it is the more ridienions because Mystery is no bear ; nor can I , for one , conceive why it should not be to every man a joy to know that all the marvel which ever was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inscrutable // processes are going on under our eyes and in them and in our hearts . Doubtless , however , many will adhere to the logic that has satisfied them so long and so well , - that it is impossible the will should move otherwise than in obedienc* to motives , and that , obeying a motive , it is not free . Why should we not , then , amuse ourselves a little with these complacent motive-mongers ? They profess a perfect explanation of mental action , and make it the stigma of a deeper philosophy , that it must leave somewhat in all action of the mind , and therefore in a doctrine of the will , unexplained . Let , now , these good gentlemen explain to us how a motive ever gets to he a motive . For there is precisely the same difficulty in initiating motion here as elsewhere . You look on a peach you desire it and you are moved hy the desire to pluck or purchase it . Now it is plain that you could not desire this peach until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could not perceive that the fruit was desirable until you had experienced desire of it . And here we are at the old , inexplicable seesaw . It must appear desirable in order to he desired ; it must be desired iu order to appear desirable : the perception must precede the desire , and the desire must precede the perception . These are foollish subtilties , hut all the fitter for their purpose . Our motive-mongering friends should understand that they can explain no farther than their neighbors ,  --  that by enslaving the will they only shift the difficulty , not solve it . Anything hut this shallow sciolism ! More philosophical a thousand times than the knowing and facile metaphysic which makes man a thing of springs and pivots and cogs , are the notions of old religionists , which attributed human action in large part to preventing , suggesting , and efficient " grace , " or those of older poets , who gave Pallas Athene for a counsellor to Odysseus , and Krishna for a teacher to the young Aryan warrior ,  - -  which represent human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Infinite . A thousand times more philosophical , as well as ten thousand times more inspiring , I say , are the metaphysics of Imagination , - of scriptures and great poems and the live human heart ,  --  than the cutand-dried sciolisms which explain you a man in five minutes , and make everything in him as obvious as the movements of a jumping-jack . To deny , then , the existence of freewill is , in my judgment , a grave error hut to deny it on the ground of its identity with chance is more than an ordinary error , however grave ; it is a poison in the blood of one 's thought , conveying its vice to every part and function of the system . And herewith we pass to the next head . 2 . Consciousness . It has been the persuasion of wise men in various ages , and is the persuasion of many , as wise , doubtless , as their neighbors , now , that the soul has a native sense of its quality and perpetual relations . By Plato @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Reminiscence ; by modern speakers of English it is denoted as Consciousness . This , according to its grades and applications , is qualified as personal , moral , intellectual , or , including all its higher functions , as intuitive or spiritual . Of this high spiritual sense , this self-recognition of soul , all the master-words of the language - God , Immortality , Life , Love , Duty - are either wholly , or in all their grander suggestions , the product . Nothing , indeed , is there which confers dignity upon human life and labor , that is not primarily due to the same source . In union with popular and unconscious imagination , it generates mythology ; in union with imagination an ( l reason , it gives birth to theology and cosmogony ; in union with imagination , reason , and experience , it is the source of philosophy ; in union with the same , together with the artistic sense and high degrees of imaginative sympathy , it creates epic poetry and art . Its total outcome , however , may he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assumed validity of consciousness , that universal belief is always an indication of // universal truth . At the same time , since this master-power finds expression through faculties various in kind and still more various in grade of development , its outcome assumes many shapes and hues , - just as crystallized alumina becomes here ruby and there sapphire , by minute admixtures of different coloring substances . We assume the validity of this prime source of belief . Why not ? here is a great natural product , human belief ; we treat it precisely as we do other natural products ; we judge , that , like these , it has its law and justification . We assume that it is to be studied as Lyell studies the earth 's crust , or Agassiz its life , or Muller its languages . As our author shuns metaphysical , so do we shun metapsychical inquiries . We do not presume to go behind universal fact , and inquire whether it has any business to be fact ; we simply endeavor to see it in its largest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But M. Comte made the discovery that this great product of man 's spiritual nature is nothing but the spawn of his self-conceit : that it is purely gratuitous , groundless , superfluous , and therefore in the deepest possible sense lawless . Mr. Buckle follows his master , for such Comte really is . Proclaiming Law everywhere else , and , from his extreme partiality to the word , often lugging it in , as it were , by the ears , he no sooner arrives at these provinces than he instantly faces the other way , and denies all that he has before advocated . Of a quadruped he will question not a hair , of a fish not a scale ; everywhere else he will accept facts and seek to coordinate them ; but when he arrives at the great natural outcome and manifestation of man 's spirit , then it is in an opposite way that he will not question ; he simply lifts his eyebrows . The fact has no business to he there ! It signifies nothing ! Why this reversal of position ? First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be admitted ; since the universal consciousness is that of freedom to choose . But there is a larger reason . In accordance with his general notions , personality must be degraded , denuded , impoverished , - that so the individual may lie passive in the arms of that society whose laws he is ambitious to expound . Having robbed the soul of choice , he now deprives it of sight ; having denied that it is an originating source of will , he now makes the complementary denial , that it is a like source of knowledge ; having first made it helpless , he now proce*ls to make it senseless . And , indeed , the two denials belong together . If it be true that the soul is helpless , pray let us have some kind drug to make it senseless also . Nature has dealt thus equally with the stone ; and surely she must design a like equality in her dealings with man . Power and perceiving she will either give together , or together withhold . But how does our author support this denial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness . There is no unity , he says , in its determinations : one believes this , another that , a third somewhat different from both ; and the faith that one is ready to die for , another is ready to kill him for . And true it is that the diversities of human belief are many and great ; let not the fact he denied nor diminished . But does such diversity disprove a fundamental unity ? All modern science answers , No . How much of outward resemblance is there between a fish and a philosopher ? Is not the difference here as wide as the widest unlikenesses in human belief ? Yet Comparative Anatomy , with none to deny its right , includes philosopher and fish in one category : they both belong to the vertebrate subkingdom . See what vast dissimilarities are included in the unity of this vertebrate structure : creatures that swim , creep , walk , fly ; creatures with two feet , with four feet , with no feet , with feet and hands , with hands only , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , or in water only , or that die at once in water or air ; creatures , in fine , more various and diverse than // imacrination , before the fact , could conceive . Yet throughout this astonishing , inconceivable variety , science walks in steady perception of a unity extending far toward details of structure . The boor laughs , when told that the forefoot of his horse and his own hand are essentially the same member . A " Positive Philosopher " laughs , when told that through Fetichism and Lutheranism there runs a thread of unity , - that human belief has its law , and may be studied in the spirit of science . But it is more than questionable whether the laugh is on their side. * But our author does not quit this subject without attempting to adduce a specific instance whercin consciousness proves fallacious . Success , however , could hardly be worse ; he fails to establish his point , but succeeds in discrediting either his candor or his discrimination . " Are we not , " he says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spectres and phantoms ; and yet is it not generally admitted that such beings have no existence at all 2 " Now I should be ashamed to charge a scholar , like Mr. Buckle , with being unaware that consciousness does not apply to any matter which comes properly under the cognizance of the * Comte did , indeed , profess to furnish a central law of belief . It is due , he said , to the tendency of man to flatter his own personality by foisting its image upon the universe . This , however , is but one way of saying that it is wholly gratuitous , - that it has no root in the truth of the world . But universal truth and universal law are the same ; and therefore that which arises without having any root in eternal verity is lawless in the deepest possible sense , - lawless not merely as being irregular in its action , but in the deeper and more terrible sense of being in the universe without belonging there . To believe , however , that any product of universal dimensions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universe , but by somewhat else , is to believe in a Devil more thoroughly than the creed of any Calvinist allows . But this is quite in character . Comte was perhaps the most superstitious man of his time ; superstition runs in the blood of* his " philosophy " ; and Mr. Buckle , in my opinion , escapes and denounces the black superstitions of ignorance only to fall into the *hited superstitious of sciolism. senses , and that the word can be honestly used in such applications only by the last extreme of ignorant or inadvertent latitude . Conscious of the existence of spectres ! One might as lawfully say he is " conscious " that there is a man in the moon , or that the color of his neighbor 's hair is due to a dye . Mr. Buckle is undoubtedly honest . how , then , could he , in strict philosophical discussion , employ the cardinal word in a sense flagrantly and even ludicrously false , in order to carry his point ? It is partly to be attributed to his controversial ardor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and frequently dazzles the eye of his understanding ; but partly it is attributable also to an infirmity in the understanding itself . He shows , indeed , a singular combination of intellectual qualities . He has great external precision , and great inward looseness and slipperiness of mind : so that , if you follow his words , no man 's thought can be clearer , no man 's logic more firm and rapid in its march ; but if you follow strictly the conceptions , the clearness vanishes , and the logic limps , nay , sprawls . It is not merely that he writes better than he thinks , though this is true of him ; but the more characteristic fact is that he is a master in the forms of thought and an apprentice in the substance . Read his pages , and you will find much to admire ; read under his pages , and you will find much not to admire . It appears from the foregoing what Mr. Buckle aims to accomplish at the outset . His purpose is to effect a thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds no clear field for the action of social law . To discrown and degrade Personality by taking away its two grand prerogatives , - this is his preliminary labor , this is his way of procuring a site for that edifice of scientific history which he proposes to build . But what an enormous price to pay for the purchase ! If there is no kingdom for social law , if there is no place for a science of history , till man is made unroyal , till the glory is taken from his // brow , the sceptre from his right hand , and the regal hopes from his heart , till he is made a mere serf and an appanage of that ground and territory of circumstance whereon he lives and labors , - why , then a science of history means much the same with an extinction of history , an extinction of all that in history which makes it inspiring . The history of rats and mice is interesting , hut not to themselves ,  --  interesting only to man , and this because he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice , pray let them look for cheese , and look out for the cat , and let goose-quills and history alone . But the truth is that Person and Society are mutually supporting facts , each weakened by any impoverishment of its reciprocal term . Whenever a real history of human civilization is written , they will thus appear . And Mr. Buckle , in seeking to empty one term in order to obtain room for the other , was yielding concessions , not to the pure necessities of truth , but to his own infirmity as a thinker . Having , however , taken the crown and kingdom from Personality , our philosophica.l Warwick proceeds to the coronation of his favorite autocrat , Society . His final proposition , which indeed is made obscurely , and as far as possible by implication , is this : - 3 . That Society is the Real Source of Individual Action . A proposition made obscurely , but argued strenuously , and altogether necessary for the completion of his foundation . He attempts proof by reference to the following facts : - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , nearly the same number of murders , suicides , and letters mailed without direction , and that marriages are more frequent when food is low and wages high , and so conversely . This is the sum total of the argument on which he relies here and throughout his work : if this proves his point , it is proven ; if otherwise , otherwise . To begin with , I admit the facts alleged . They are overstated ; there is considerable departure from an exact average : but let this pass . I will go farther , and admit , what no one has attempted to show , that an average in these common and outward matters proves the like regularity in all that men do and think and feel . This to concentrate attention upon the main question . And the main question is , What do these regular averages signify ? Do they denote the dominancy of a social fate ? " Yea , yea , " cry loudly the French fatalists ; and " Yea , yea , " respond with firm assurance Buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are many to say in our own land . Even Mr. Emerson must summon his courage to confront " the terrible statistics of the French statisticians . " But I live in the persuasion that these statistics are extremely innocent , and threaten no man 's liberty . Let us see . Take first the instance of forgetfulness . In the United Kingdom some millions of letters are annually mailed ; and of these , one in a certain number of thousands , " making allowance , " as our author innocently says , " for variation of circumstances , " is found to be mailed without a superscription . Now provision for a forgetting is made in every man 's individual constitution . Partly for permanent and final forgetting ; in this way we get rid of vast quantities of trash , which would suffocate us , if we could not obtain riddance . Partly also for temporary forgetting ; by means of which we become oblivious to everything but the matter in hand , and , by a sole concentration upon that , act intensely and efficaciously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this provision for temporary obliviousness may become an infirmity , and in some is an habitual and chronic infirmity . Let us now assume an individual man , and suppose ourselves able to analyze perfectly his mental condition . From his temperament , constitution , and habit , we shall then be able also to infer with precision the measure of his liability to lapse of memory . Place him , now , in a world by himself ; give him a life of several centuries ' duration ; and secure him through // life from essential change of constitution . Divide , then , his life into centuries ; count the instances of forgetfulness in each century ; and in each century they will he found nearly the same . The Law of Probability determines this , and enables us to speak with entire confidence of a case so supposed . Here , then , is the continuous average ; hut it surely indicates no subjection of the individual soul to a law of society ; for there is no society to impose such law ,  --  there is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one individual , let us suppose a hundred ; and let each of these be placed on a separate planet . Obtain in respect to each one the measure of his liahility to infirm lapse of memory , and add these together . And now it will appear that the average outward result which one man gave in one hundred years one hundred men will give in one year . The law of probability again comes in , and , matching the irregularities of one by those of another , gives in this case , as in the former , an average result . Here , then , is Mr. Buckle 's average without the existence of a society , and therefore without any action of social law . Does another syllable need to be said ? Perhaps , however , it will be objected that I redeem the individual from a fate working in the general whole of society , only to subject him to an equal fate working in his own constitution . There is undonbtedly a certain degree of fate expressed in each man 's temperament and particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social fate subjects each man totally , and in effect robs him of personality ; the fate which works in his own constitution subjects him only in that proportion which his abnormal liability bears to the total force of his mind . One letter in ten thousand , say , is mailed without direction . Our historian of civilization infers hence that each individual is totally subject to a social fate . My inference is , that , on the average , each individual is one ten-thousandth part subject to a fate in his private constitution . There is the difference , and it does not seem to me insignificant . Our way to the cases of crime is now somewhat more clear ; for it is already established beyond cavil that the mere fact of an average , to which , without any discriminations , our philosopher appeals with such confidence , proves nothing for his purpose . The case of murders , however , differs from the foregoing in one important particular . The persons who are detected in the commission of this crime are commonly , by their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consequently the average is kept up , not by the same persons , but in part by different ones . Here is , therefore , more appearance of the mediation of compulsory social law ; and indeed the action of social forces in the case I am far more disposed to assert than to question . What we are to inquire , however , is not whether social forces contribute to this result , but whether they are such forces as supersede and annihilate individual will . Let us see . All men are liable to collisions of passion and interest with their neighbors and contemporaries . All desire to remove the obstructions thus opposed . All would labor for this end with brute directness , that is , by lawless violence and cunning , were it not for the rational and moral elements in their nature , which sngge*t noble pieces of abstinence and self-restraint , thus securing a certain freedom , a certain superiority to the brute pressure of interest and impulse . These rational and moral elements are in variable counterpoise with the ruder desires ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by struggle , sometimes striving with them feebly and vainly , or even ceasing to strive . Suppose , now , a nation of thirty millions . Of these , twenty-nine millions , let us say , are never consciously tempted to commit a felony . Why ? For want of opportunity ? Not at all ; good men , whom the police do not watch , have more opportunities for crime than those whose character causes them to be suspected . Is it because wrnthfnl passion , the love of money , and other incentives to aggres // sion are unknown to them ? To none are they wholly unknown . Why , then , this immunity from temptation ? Simply hecause their choices , or characters , - for character is hut structural choice , - run in favor of just and prudent courses with a tide so steady and strong as to fill all the river-beds of action , and leave no room for worse currents . In other words , the elements that make men free hold , in this respect , easy sovereignty in their souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be open to such temptation , but for the influence of good customs , which are the legacies left by good men dead , and kept in force by the influence of just men who are living . In these , the freedom-making elements still keep the throne , and preserve regal sway ; but they are like sovereigns who might be dethroned , but for the countenance of more powerful neighbors . Below these , the liability to actual commission of violence begins to open ; but there are , we will suppose , ninety thousand in whom it is practically suppressed by the dangers which , in civilized communities , attend upon crime . These men have that in them which might make them felons , but for penal laws , prisons , and the executioner . But below these are ten thousand who have a liability in excess of all restraining influences whatsoever ; and the result of this liability , in accordance with the law of probability already mentioned , is two hundred murders in a year. * Now here the action of fate does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , freedom is not extinguished ; the rational and moral elements that confer it are weak , but they are not necessarily dead or inoperative ; for , in conjunction with lower restraints , they actually make the number of crimes not ten thousand , hut two hundred . True it is , that these are partially enslaved , partially subject to fate ; but they are enslaved not by any inscrutable law of society , comparable with " that which pre * J* may he said that this is a mere arguing by supposition . But the supposition here has respect only to the numbers . serves the balance of the sexes " ; they are " taken captive by their own lusts , " as one of our philosopher 's " ignorant men " said many years ago . But above these the enslaving liability begins to disappear , and freedom soon becomes , so far as this test applies , supreme . Thus for one year we apply a measure of the liability to crime , and obtain a result which is inexpressibly far from sustaining Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force is to all freeing forces as two hundred to thirty millions , - and shows , moreover , that this fate , instead of inclosing in its toils every man in the nation , and utterly depriving all of freedom , actually touches at all but a small number , and only diminishes , not destroys , the freedom of these . Next year we apply the same measure to nearly the same persons , in the presence of nearly the same restraints ; and find , of course , the result to he nearly the same . But this result no more proves universal enslavement in the second year than it did in the first . And so of the third , fourth , or fortieth application of the measure . But a portion of these murderers are yearly withdrawn : ought not the number of crimes to diminish ? It would do so , but for that law of social propagation which is ever and everywhere active . But this law , which connects men and generations , and tends to make history a unit , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much fate and so much freedom as there are to be carried . It changes nothing ; it is simply a vehicle , and transports freight , - precious stones or ballast stones , as the case may be . Therefore , in unveiling a single year , and seeing precisely what this fact of two hundred murders means , we find its meaning for any possible succession of years . It shows certain measures of fate working in the bosoms of certain numbers of men ; but that there is a fate inhabiting society as such , and holding every man and woman in its unfeeling hand , must be proven , if at all , by other facts than these . Mr. Buckle generalizes with marvellous facility , but often with an infatuation , // 38 Mr. Buckle as a Thinker. or even fatuity , equally marvellous . Specious and audacious generalization is , however , a vice of thinking more attractive to most than any virtue , - above all , if it flatter their wishes and opinions . There are few to appreciate an exquisite temperance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether in thought or art . The great masters disappoint , the great showmen dazzle , at first sight ; the multitudes crave sensations and sudden effects . Even among thoughtful men , there are , in this galloping age , too many who prefer to frequent a philosophical slop-shop , where they can be fitted to a full suit in five minutes ; and they willingly forgive some bagging and wrinkling , some ripping of seams and droppingoff of buttons , in consideration of promptitude in the supply . Nor is this unnatural . Ordinary travel goes by steam does it not seem a little hard that thought should have to journey still in the ancient fashion ? And so far as the mass of readers is concerned , this appetite for fast thinking and reckless generalization is a cheerful token : it is a gainful substitute for that hiding away from the blaze of intellect , that terror of large results in thought , which has harbored in the Vatican since the days of Galileo , and even in Protestant lands may sometimes he found , like the graveyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premature and extravagant generalization may be pardoned in the mass of readers ; but in the writer ? " It must needs be that offences come ; but woe to that man by whom the offence cometh l " Mr. Buckle finds some general bookfacts , and , never trying to think down to their roots , he seizes upon their specious aspect , and thence rushes out into a generalization , which , rightly understood , sweeps Personality off the earth . Not such is the spirit of science ; not such the manner of its masters . Look at Newton investigating colors . What effort for nearness , nearness , nearness to his facts ! What solicitation for entrance to their households and sanctuaries ! See Agassiz or Tyndale investigating the flow of glaciers. here is no catching at bookaspects of the matter , and launching instantly into generalization . No , these men must get within eyeshot , within hand-reach , of the facts , and know first precisely and intimately what these are . Yet the generalizations for which they were seeking a basis were trivial in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance at M. Quetelet . " A continuous average of so many murders a year ; then so many must happen ; then somebody must commit them ; then free-will is a figment , and society is the source of all action which we call mdivi ( lual . " Intemperate and infatuated generalization , if supported by a certain ability , is an attractive vice . Yet he who indulges in this will be sure to leave upon his brilliant and exciting pages statements that are simply ludicrous . Our philosopher furnishes an instance of this in his treatment of the matter of marriage . If wages be low and food high , marriages are less frequent ; if the converse be the case , they are more frequent . What conclusion would common sense base upon this fact ? Why , of course , that the number*of marriages is definitely influenced by the ease with which sustenance is obtained . But this is a commonplace result ; there is nothing in it bold , hrilliant , striking ; besides , it does not make man the slave of outward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follows : - " Marriages , instead of having any connection with personal feelings , are completely controlled by the price of food and the rate of wages . " He does not distinguish between a definite modifying influence and a controlling cause . His facts prove the former ; he asserts the latter . Let us see how this procedure would work elsewhere . There is " a definite relation , " in our author 's words , between the force and direction of the winds and the rise or fall of the sea upon our coast : therefore tidal rise and fall , " instead of bavin , , any connection " with the influence of the moon , are " completely controlled " by the direction and force of // the wind ! There is a definite relation " between the straightness or want of straightness in a railroad and the speed of the train : erga , the speed of the train , " instead of having any connection " with the locomotive and the force of steam , is " completely controlled " by the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to philosophize after this fashion ; hut if we are to have many professors of such philosophy , let the mediteval cap-and-bells , by all means , be reproduced . Again , having stated the fact of an approximation to a continuous average of suicides , and having assumed for this a cause operating in the indivisible whole of society , he goes on to say , " And the power of this larger law is so irresistible , that neither the love of life nor the fear of another world can avail anything toward even checking its operation . " How , pray , does Mr. Buckle know ? What shadow of a fact has he to justify this vaunting of his " larger law " ? Has he ever known the love of life and the awe of another world to be suspended ? Has he afterwards seen their action restored , and ascertained that in their presence and in their absence the ratio of suicides remained the same ? These questions answer themselves . But when a writer who loudly professes and fully believes himself to proceed purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless as this , who can pass to the next paragraph in full confidence of his intellectual rectitude ? If you retain , as in this case I do retain , assurance of his moral rectitude , - of his intention to be fair , - to what conclusion can you come more charitable than this , that his partiality to his own notions is so vigorous as not only to overslaugh his sense of logical truth , but to supersede the necessity of other grounds for believing these notions and for urging them ? Only our author 's first chapter has been dealt with ; firstly , because in this are enunciated those radical conceptions which he afterwards argues not to , but from ; and secondly , because it has been the writer 's desire , avoiding all vagrant and indecisive criticism , to have a fair grapple , and come to some clear result , - like that of a wrestler , who frankly proffers himself to throw or be thrown . It only remains to indicate , so far as may be , a comprehensive estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be said in plain words that he is to be regarded as an adventurer in the kingdoms of thought , - though the word must be freed from all customary flavors of charlatanry and wickedness . One of the boldest and cleverest of his class ; a man , too , of probity , of dignity and character , amiable , estimable ; but intellectually an adventurer nevertheless . The grand masters in thought are those to whom the subtilest and most purely universal principles are nearest and most habitual , coming to the elucidation of all minutest matters no less than to that of the greatest , - as those forces which hold the solar system together apply themselves , as on the same level , to a mote wandering in the air ; and because to these masters first principles , through all their changes of seeming , through all their ranging by analogy up and down , are never disguised , but are always near and clear and sure , they can admit the action of all modifying principles without imperilling the great stabilities of truth ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dust-particle shall float and fly with the wind , and yet gravitation shall hold particle and world in firm , soft , imperial possession . And next to these are the inventors , guided by a fine felicity of intelligence to special discoveries and admirable combinations , often surpassing in this way the masters themselves . And then come the wise and great scholars , who learn quickly what has been discovered , and follow the masters not by sight only , as a greyhound , but by long inferences ; and these also do noble work . And after these follow the broader company of useful , able , eloquent men , applying , explaining , illustrating , and preparing the way for schools and commerce and the // newspaper . Finally comes a man with a genius for boldness more than for anything else , so that he has a pleasant feeling of himself only when he gives himself the sense of being startling , novel , venturesome , and therefore goes off in his thought as in a balloon : and of such man , - being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , - this will be the unfailing characteristic , that he substitutes and asserts secondary principles , which are obvious , outward , and within his reach , for primary principles , which are deep , subtile , inward , and beyond his reach ; he will swing loose from the principles which are indeed prime and imperial in Naturc , and will boldly assert secondary principles as fundamental : this man is the intellectual adventurer . And this is Mr. Buckle . The first fact with regard to man is his possession of a rational soul , and consequently of that liberation of will without which , despite the existence of reason , he could not be in act a reasonable being . But the secondary fact in this connection is that man 's freedom is modified by pedigree , by temperament , by influences almost numberless , and that he is included in laws , so that , if he falls away from reason , he falls into the hands of fate . And this secondary or modifying congeries of facts our author announces as primary . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent and vocal , - that it is not merely a subject , but also an organ , of ThAT WHICH KNOWS in the universe . The modifying fact is that its voice is commonly obscure , and the language it shall use and the logic of its utterance prescribed by the accident of time , place , and other circumstances ; so that it has the semblance of voices many and contradictory . And this modifying fact Mr. Buckle announces , with much assurance and complacency , as primary . The first fact in the world of man is Personality . The secondary fact is Society , - secondary , but reciprocal , and full of import . And Mr. Buckle begins with making Personality acephalous , and ends with appending its corpse to Socie ty , to be galvanized into seemings of life . And if you follow him through his book , you find this inversion constantly maintained , - and find , moreover , that it is chiefly this revolutionary audacity which makes his propositions so startling and his pages to many so fascinating . Therefore an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the modifying fact is that he has the manners of a gentleman , the heart of a humanitarian , the learning of a scholar , the pen of a ready writer , the outside or shell of a philosophical genius , excellent admixtures of sense , and an attractive hatred of ecclesiastical and political barbarisms . He has great surface-reach , but no inward breadth . He invariably takes the liberal side with regard to practical and popular questions ; he invariably takes the illiberal side in respect to questions of philosophy . In politics and in social feeling he is cosmopolitan ; in questions of pure thought he is cockney . Here he is a ' tyrant ; he puts out the soul 's eyes , and casts fetters about its feet ; here he is hard , narrow , materialistic , mechanical , - or , in a word , English . For-we may turn aside to say - in philosophy no nation is so straitened , illiberal , and hard of hearing as England , except , perhaps , China . Its tympanum is sadly thickened at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thinker there is either ignored into silence , like Wilkinson , or driven to bellow , like Carlyle , or to put rapiers and poignards into his speech , like Ruskin . Carlyle began speaking sweetly and humanly , and was heard only on this side the ocean ; then he came to his bull-of-Bashan tones , and was attended to on his own side the water . It is observable , too , that , if a thinker in America goes beyond the respectable dinner-table depth , your true Englishman takes it for a personal affront , and hastens to make an ass of himself in the " Saturday Review . " Apply to Mr. Buckle any test that determines the question of pure intellectual power , and he fails to sustain it . Let us proceed to apply one . // No man is an able thinker who is without power to comprehend that law of reciprocal opposites , on which the world is built . For an example of this : the universe is indeed a uni-verse , a pure unit , emanating , as we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old Hooker , " not only one , but very oneness , " simple , indivisible , and therefore total in all action ; and yet this universe is various , multifarious , full of special character , full even of fierce antagonisms and blazing contradictions . Infinite and Finite , Same and Diverse , Eternal and Temporary , Universal and Special , - here they are , purest opposites , yet mutual , reciprocal , necessary to each other ; and he is a narrow man who can not stand in open relations with both terms , reconciling in the depths of his life , though he can never explain , the mystery of their friendship . He who will adhere only to the universal , and makes a blur of the special , is a rhapsodist ; he who can apprehend only the special , being blind and callous to the universal , is a chatterer and magpie . From these opposites we never escape Destiny and Freedom , Rest and Motion , Individual and Society , Origination and Memory , Intuition and Observation , Soul and Body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , without losing their character of opposites , nay , in very virtue of their opposition , playing into and supporting each other . But , from the fact that they are opposites , it is always easy to catch up one , and become its partisan as against the other . It is easy in such advocacy to be plausible , forcible , affluent in words and apparent reasons ; also to be bold , striking , astonishing . And yet such an advocate will never speak a word of pure truth . " He who knows half , " says Goethe , " speaks much , and says nothing to the purpose ; he who knows all inclines to act , and speaks seldom or late . " With such partisanship and advocacy the world has been liberally , and more than liberally , supplied . Such a number of Eurekas have been shouted ! So often it has been discovered that the world is no such riddle , after all , - that half of it is really the whole ! No doubt all this was good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while ; then it ceased to be even a joke , and grew a weariness and an affliction ; and at length we all rejoiced when the mighty world-pedagogue of Chelsea seized his ferule , and roared , over land and sea , " Silence , bab-blers ! " If only Mr. Buckle had profited by the command ! For , follow this writer where you will , you find him the partisan of a particular term as against its fraternal opposite . It is Fate against Free-Will Society against the prerogatives of Personality ; Man against Outward Nature ( for he considers them only as antagonistic , one " triumphing " over the other ) ; Intellect against the Moral Sense ; Induction against Deduction and Intuition ; Knowledge against Reverence ; and so on and on to the utter weariness of one reader , if of no more . For what can be more wearying and saddening than to follow the pages of a writer who is fertile , ingenious , eloquent , rich in right feeling , in reading and courage , and yet who , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tome of powerful chapters , is merely persuading you that half is the whole ' ? And if your duty as a scholar require you to peruse the book fully , instead of casting it aside , your mind at length fairly aches for the sense of poise and soundness , were it only for a single page . But no ; it is always the same succession of perspicuous and vigorous sentences , all carrying flavors of important truth , and none utterly true . For the half is really half ; but it simply is not the whole , be as eloquent about it as one may . Such , then , is the estimate here given of Mr. Buckle 's laborious and powerful work . Meantime , with every secondary merit which such a work could possess this is replete ; while its faults are only such as were inseparable from the conjunction of such ambitions with such powers . He may whet and wield his blade ; but he puts no poison on its edge // He may disparage reverence ; but he is not himself irreverent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but , while withholding no syllable of dissent and reprehension , he utters not a syllable that can insult or sting . And all the while his pages teem with observations full of point , and half full of admirable sense and suggestion . After all , we owe him thanks ,  --  thanks , it may be , even for his errors . The popular notions of moral liberty are prohahly not profound , and require deepening . The grand fact that we name Personality is grand and of an unsounded depth only because in it Destiny and Freedom meet and heconie one . But the play into this of Destiny and Eternal Necessity is , in general , dimly discerned . The will is popularly pronounced free , but is thought to originate , as it were , " between one 's hat and his hoots " ; and so man loses all largeness of relation , and personality all grandeur . Now blisters , though ill for health , may be wholesome for disease ; and doctrines of Fate , that empty every man of his soul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make one 's soul of a pin's-head dimension . It may be well , also , that the doctrine of Social Fate should he preached until all are made to see that Society is a fact ,  --  that it is generative , - that personal development can not go on but by its mediation , - that the chain of spiritual interdependence can not be broken , and that in proportion as it is weakened every bosom becomes barren . In this case also Mr. Buckle may be medicinal . We owe him thanks also for refreshing our expectation of a science of civilization , - for affirming the venerableness of intellect , which recent teachers have undervalued , - for vindicating the uses of doubt , - and , finally , for a specimen of intellectual intrepidity of which one could wish there were less need . And withal how royally he presumes upon a welcome for candid confession of his thought ! Such a presumption could be created in his soul only by a great magnanimity ; and the evidence of this on his pages sheds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an *iEdipus . He has guessed ; and the riddle awaits another comer . A science of history he has not established the direction in which it lies he has not pointed out ; and if Hegel and his precursors have failed to indicate such a science , the first clear step toward it remains yet to be taken . And should some majestic genius - for no other will be sufficient for the task - at length arise to lay hold upon the facts of man history , and exercise over them a Newtonian sway , he will be the last man on the planet to take his initial hint from Auguste Comte and the " Positive Philosophy . " This mud-mountain is indeed considerably heaped up , but it is a very poor Pisgah nevertheless ; for it is a mountain in a pit , whose top does not rise to an equality with the broad common levels , far less with the high table-lands and skyward peaks and summits of intelligence .                 @ @ @ @
