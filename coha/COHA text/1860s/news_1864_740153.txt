txt The following private letter from an eminent public man in the interior of this State only repeats in strong terms what reaches us daily from many quarters : STRACUSS , Tuesday , NOV. 29 , 1884 . MY Dna SIR : For months past we have all been reading accounts of the atrocious conduct of the rebels toward our prisoners . No language can do it justice . The heart sickens at the sad recital . But have we not already spent time enough In detailing these unheard of outrages ? Why not stop reciting them and turn our attention to the remedy ? I have no hesitation in saying that we have a perfect remedy , and that no apology can be made for the Government in not long , long since applying it . There is but one way to deal with these barbarians , and that is by a severity which they shall appreciate and feel . We must retaliate their heathenism upon themselves . Months ago the President ought to have given notice to JEFFERSON Devrs in writing , that unless within thirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the rebel Dens were in all respects provided for according to the usages of civilized nations , that every rebel prisoner in our possession should at once be turned into an open pen , without a shingle to cover him ; that he would be stripped of his shoes and stockings , his hat , coat and vet , anti shirt , if he bad one ; that he WI:Arid be led on the poorest and scantiest fare , and that they would remain in that condition till our prisoners were properly cared for , and perfect evidence furnished of the fact . Would this be cruel and inhuman ? Just the reverse . It would put an end to cruelty and inhumanity . Our soldiers would be relieved from their sufferings in thirty days . Would it not be effectual ? Think you JEFF . DAVIS would let 40,000 rebels suffer starvation and death for the sake of starving our soldiers in fits hands ? But if he would , then let them suffer . Brit he would not . Now . why does not the Government apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be starved in their pens before we fight them with the only weapons that they can feel ? For the sake of God and humanity , and our poor starved , diseased and dying soldiers and friends , let us have the only remedy within our reach . You are nearer to the seat of power than I am . You can call on Mr. latiooLN and ask him to save the lives of those not yet dead . Why will you not act in this matter , and call down the blessings of thousands and tens of thousands , starving , rotting and dying in worse than Southern slave pens , and forever oblige Your friend and humble servant , lion . H. J. RAYMOND . The above represents the public sentiment of a very large portion of the country . There is not a shadow of doubt that the rebel authorities have deliberately and intention ally treated our prisoners in their hands with the most barbarous and inhuman cruelty . They have starved them , exposed them to rain and cold without clothing or shelter , withheld from them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and encouraged their guards , by applause and rewards , to shoot them in cold blood for technical and unintentional violations of arbitrary and useless rules . They have done this steadily and systematically , for many long months , against the remonstrances of their own Surgeons , and in infamous disregard of the rules of war and the interests of humanity . Upon all these points , the testimony we have published from time to time from our own correspondents leaves no room for doubt . Justice and public sentiment demand that these tortures should be stopped . By what measures that can be done is a problem of no little difficulty . The Government has not been heedless of the subject , but has been as anxious as the most zealous of the people , to afford relief . The rebels have some 45,000 of our troops prisoners in their hands , and we have some 55,000 of their troops in ours . A wholesale exchange would place forthwith in the ranks of their armies 45,000 strong , healthy , able-bodied men , and would thus enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture many thousands more of our soldiers , ? while it would not increase the strength of our forces by a single man . The Government may , in our opinion , very properly take this fact into consideration as one of the arguments to which weight Is due in deciding upon the policy to be pursued . It is possible that such an exchange , if it could be effected , would , in the long run , cause more suffering than it would cure ; if it should seem certain to do so , the Government can hardly be denounced for hesitating to adopt it . If this is not adopted , retaliation seems to be the next mode of seeking redress . The whole instinct of common humanity revolts at its infliction in kind . We doubt whether men could be found in the North , who as guards or commanding officers , who could possibly enforce it . They could not hold the prisoners under their charge to the horrors of starvation , exposure and unrelieved sickness , and watch their tortures , day by day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad the training requisite for the infliction of such savage barbarities . It takes the discipline of years in the cruelties of slavery to fit human beings for such a service . But our Government may very well adopt some measures of retaliation . They can at least put their prisoners upon the diet of prisoners in our penitentiaries , and subject them to restraints sufficiently severe to be seriously felt . Whether they can go as far as our correspondent suggests and urges , is a matter for them to determine ; we do not believe that , with just regard for the national character , and with necessary deference to public sentiment , they can do so . The agreement already made and in progress of execution , by which we can send blankets , clothing , food and other necessaries to our prisoners in rebel hands , will do much toward alleviating the horrors of their condition . if it is carried out with sufficient vigor , and if the rebels permit our commissioners to discharge their functions in this matter thoroughly and steadily , the evils hitherto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And until this experiment has been faithfully tried , the Government will probably be indisposed to resort to either of the other modes suggested .
