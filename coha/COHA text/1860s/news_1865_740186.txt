txt Gen. ShErman 's army is now on the verge of North Carolina , if it is not already within the lines of the State . We hear of no frantic proclamations from the Governor , no " last ditch " resolutions from the Legislature which is in session , no wild appeals from popular leaders or from the press ; but the whole people , as far as we have heard , seem to await the advance of SHERMAN 'S invincible army with perfect composure , if riot with torpor . In the meantime a private letter has been received from Gen. SIIERMAN himself , of which our Washington correspondent made mention yesterday , in which the General says that the people of the " Old North State " are prepared to hail the advent of his army among them , and promptly wheel the State into the Union . Gen. SHERMAN does not speak at random , nor without full and definite information concerning that of which he writes . He is not a sanguine man , nor one who is ever led away by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residence in various parts of the South before the war , and from campaigning in nine of the Southern States during the past four years . lie has never expressed himself in the same way about any other State . Such a course on the part of North Carolina is just what might be expected . The traditions of the State are Union and National , its antecedents Whig , its spirit Conservative . It always stood aloof from political ultraism , and from the fanatical vagaries of South Carolina . The points of antagonism between these two States were innumerable , the feelings of mutual animosity were very strong , and the public councils and action nearly always different . There will be no grief in North Carolina over the chastisement administered to South Carolina , no sympathy with the practical humiliation which has followed her windy bluster . South Carolina 's intolerable self-conceit is not better known in the North than her contempt for her sister States is known in the South . If there is anything a South Carolinian hates more than a " Yankee , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a " free nigger , " it is a North Carolinian . The way in which the Palmetto chivalry have lately acted will not increase the admiration of North Carolina for them . North Carolina never wanted to secede from the Union . Her geographical position made it hard for her to stay in , after Virginia and South Carolina had seceded . She did not want to go to war with them , and therefore joined their fortunes . Indeed , she did not want to go to war at all , and had no thought that Secession would plunge her into it . It will be remembered also how , during the secession frenzy , North Carolina was overrun by fire-eating and hot-headed politicians from South Carolina , Virginia and other States . Madmen , foaming at the mouth , flew from town to town , from county to county , from the mountains to the seaboard , stirring up the people , inflaming their passions and driving them half out of their wits by menacing them if they did not join the South . Sober North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , would pever have passed An ordinance of secession . Nothing would be more natural than , now that she has had opportunity to come to her senses , and see the results of secession , she should , to use Gen. SHERMAN 'S words , " promptly wheel back into the Union . " Militarily viewed , North Carolina has no means of self-defence against SHERMAN 'S army . Nearly all her soldiers are in LSE 's army , and the few that are not there are defending Wilmington against Gen. SCHOFIELD . It would be the most cheering sign we have ever had , if Nroth Carolina should take the judicious , step of quitting the broken-down Confederacy , and returning to the old Union . She w ould be welcomed back . We have often complained of the slow progress of reconstruction on the part of the Southern States conquered by our arms . If North Carolina took the lead , we would quickly see other Slates follow her example ; and the people of Georgia and Alabama , at least , would soon unfurl , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words of Gen. SHERMAN are the most encouraging we have ever had .
