THE family from which Karl Otto von Bismarck-Schiinhausen comes belongs to the oldest noble stock in the province of Brandenburg , the corner-stone of the Prussian monarchy , and its origin is traced back to the earliest periods of German history . Several of its members rendered distinguished services to the Prussian state at different times . Two sat successively for many years in the cabinet of Frederick the Great . A shoot of this venerable ancestral tree , this man , destined to play so prominent a part in i*odern history , grew up among a class that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tenacity to mediaval notions of society and state . Antiquated dogmas of the divine origin of monarchical power , the providential subordination of all other elements in the body social and politic to the aristocracy of blood , the sacredness of hereditary privileges , together with a most ardent devotion to the reigning dynasty , constitute the political creed of this class , to which it adheres with blind and stubborn zeal to this day . These doctrines of Prussian High Toryism were instilled into the mind of Herr von Bismarck from his very childhood , and took the firmest root . Of a fervid temperament , he embraced them with such earnestness , that , notwithstanding his great native intelligence , he failed to perceive their true character even after his judgment had been ripened by years . As we shall see , they furnished the main impulse to the first part of his public career . Herr von Bismarck was either devoid of ambition and was unconscious of his talents in his younger days , or he was too ambitious and too conscious of his capacity to submit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prussia . At any rate , after finishing his studies at the universities of G*5ttingen , Berlin , and Greifswalde , and passing - by no means brilliantly , it is said - the final examination prescribed for all aspirants for an administrative or judicial career , he retired to the modest estates of his family in Prussian Saxony ; and spent several years in all but absolute obscurity , devoting himself industriously to their management . The only public duties he performed in that period were the humble ones of supervisor of the public dikes of his district . In time , however , his natural abilities and zealous profession of feudal theories of government attracted the attention of his social equals , and they chose him as one of the representatives of the equestrian order in the Estates of their province . In this capacity he served for some years , but , owing to the almost purely administrative character and narrow territorial scope of the functions of that body , his labors in it gave him only a local reputation . His first appearance upon a broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon his thirty-fourth year . Up to that time Prussia had been little better than an absolute monarchy . The solemn promise of a constitutional government , made in 1815 by Frederick William III. , had not been kept either by himself or his successor . But in 1847 , the latter , Frederick William IV. , having sagacity enough to understand the meaning of the popular restlessness then manifest all over Europe , determined to break the force of the revolutionary storm , the coming of which he foresaw , by making some concessions to his subjects . Accordingly he convoked the Estates of the kingdom , composed of class representatives of the three social orders , the nobility and gentry , the inhabitants of cities and towns , and the peasantry , into a common deliberative body , for the purpose of revising the organic laws of the state , so as to give to the tax-payers some limited voice in the regulation of the receipts and expenditures of the government , and to remove some of the feudal features of the existing laws . Herr von Bismarck appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a representative of the equestrian order of his province , and soon made himself felt in the mem // 1869.11 Karl Otto von ERROR? orable session of that body . The expectation of his noble constituents that he would be one of the boldest champions of their political faith was realized to the fullest extent . He became at once the leader of the party of ultra-conservatives , and advocated their views , whenever occasion offered , with an enthusiasm bordering on fanaticism . The concessions proposed by the government were but a very small measure of popular rights , and would have established but the semblance of a constitutional monarchy . Insignificant , however , as they were , Bismarck opposed each and all of them with passionate bigotry . Once , when in the course of debate reference was made to the unfulfilled promises of the predecessor of the reigning monarch , he maintained that the great rising of 1813 , which had delivered Germany from French usurpation and saved the Prussian throne , had not given the Prussian people any claim to constitutional rule , - a declaration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor did he lose any opportunity of proclaiming the doctrine that the Prussian monarchs were in possession of absolute sovereignty solely by the grace of God , and not by that of the people . During the discussion of a bill intended to place the Jews , who until then had enjoyed almost no civil rights in Prussia , on an equal footing with the Christians in certain respects , he seemed to take pains to prove , that , besides being imbued with the most reactionary political views , he was also brimful of religious intolerance . He said , that , while he was proud of belonging to a political and religious school which was commonly considered as reflecting the darkness of the medieval period , he was prouder still of having imbibed anti-Jewish prejudices with his mother 's milk . An amendment to the same law permitting Jews to hold civil office he opposed most vehemently , on the ground that he should feel shocked and outraged to see a Jew represent the sacred majesty of the king . Thus Herr von Bismarek made his debut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The course of the party he led but hastened the coming of a revolutionary crisis , and its conservatism , like that which upheld slavery in the United States , was of the destructive kind . In trying to hinder all political progress , it only fostered the existing germs // of revolution . Within a few months a revolutionary tide surged high against most of the Continental thrones . Berlin , no less than Paris , Vienna , Munich , and other capitals , became the scene of street battles . The reforms which king and nobility had refused to grant were now exacted by the exasperated people over barricades . The Tory champion was appalled , but not cowed , by the determined and triumphant assertion of popular rights . Pugnacity , equally with enthusiasm , is one of his characteristic qualities . No sooner had the party of reaction recovered from its first fright than Bismarck eagerly lent a helping hand to its efforts to overthrow the democratic cause . He looked upon the rising in arms against royalty as an unpardonable crime , and was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities ought to be wiped from the face of the earth , as the parents of most of the modern revolutions . The events of 1848 and 1849 made no impression upon his stolid conservatism , and only rendered his antagonism to popular rights more bitter and unbending . Elected a member of the lower house of the legislative body , arbitrarily constituted by royal decree after the dissolution at the point of the bayonet of the National Assembly of 1848 , he was not slow in showing that lie had learned nothing . As before , he became a leader of the ultra-reactionists , and attacked with the spirit of a crusader progress in every form . He opposed the granting of a political amnesty by the king . He advocated the continuance of the iron rule of martial law in Berlin . He denounced the leaders of the democratic movements as rebels . The national parliament , still sitting at Frankfort-on-the-Main , he styled a lawless body . He disputed the soundness of the fundamental principle of all constitutional government , - the right of the legislative representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. vation , and even the extension , of the hereditary prerogatives of the nobility . He spoke against freeing the mechanical trades from the fetters of the old guild system . He expressed horror of the tendency to reduce the autocratic sovereignty , built up in Prussia by Frederick the Great , to the insignificance of the royal power in Great Britain . Holding all modifications of the old status to be mischievous , he in the session of 1850 of // the same body opposed even the bills submitted by the ultrareactionary ministry then in power . Thus , he pronounced himself against a limitation of the manorial jurisdiction of the lauded nobility , on the ground that such a measure would rekindle the spirit of revolution . His recommendations were often so utterly at variance with ordinary prudence , that his own party more frequently rejected than adopted them . That there was not much of the stuff of a liberal reformer in Herr von Bismarek at this stage of his career requires no further demonstration . But besides being a virulent adversary of all social and political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , and the aggrandizement of Prussia at the expense of Austria , - the very ends to the accomplishment of which he owes all his later reputation . Realizing that popular liberty would inevitably follow national unity , he strove as firmly against the one as the other , both in the Prussian Chamber of Deputies in 1849 and in the national rump parliament , of the latter of which his party elected him a member , during its brief lease of life in 1850 at Erfurt . In the former he attacked again and acain the national constitution elaborated at Frankfort in 1848 and 1849 . His great objection to it was , that it had a tendency to destroy what he called " specific Prussianism . " " Prussians we are , " he said , " and Prussians we mean to remain . I know that these words express the sentiment not only of the Prnssian army , but of the majority of the Prussian people . I will add , that I trust in God we shall be Prussians long after that sheet of paper the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withered leaf . " The national rising of 1848 , in support of the efforts of the Duchies of Schleswig-Holstein to cast off Danish rule , was denounced , as encouraging a " revolution against a lawful sovereign , " by the very man who fourteen years later went to war with IDenmark in their behalf . At Erfurt he maintained that the cooperation of Prnssia with Austria in strangling liberalism throughout Germany was necessary and justifiable . Again , he , whose principal argument in 1866 in jnstification of the violent severance of the federal ties between Austria and the rest of Germany was the essentially non-German character of // that power , then scouted the idea that the Hapsburg dominions were not an integral part of Germany . " I can not acknowledge , " said he , " that , becanse Slaves and iRuthenians are ruled by Austria , these elements represent the national character of that state , and that the German race is simply a subordinate component part of it . I recognize in Austria the representative of an ancient German power that has often and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although not always a model of discretion , had yet proved too valuable an auxiliary in the repression of revolutionary tendencies not to be signally rewarded by the conservative ministry after the triumph of reaction was fully assured . His errors had been errors of judgment , never of will . Hence it was not strange that he should receive a distinguished reward in the spring of 1851 , in the form of an appointment to high office . But it was a little singular , that , by being made a Privy Councillor of Legation and First Secretary of the Prussian Embassy to the Federal Diet , this Hotspur should be employed in a branch of the public service in which sound discretion is more indispensable than in any other . Yet the result proved that the favor of the ministry was not unworthily bestowed . He eagerly accepted the appointment , for it opened the way to a rapid and brilliant career . In less than three months he found himself raised to the rank of Ambassador to the Diet . Thus Herr von Bismarck 's parliamentary career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interrupted for many years . During its course he had shown the merit of rigid consistency and fearlessness , and considerable notice was the natural result of the very extravagance of his views . But within the legislative arena it was something more than the character of his opinions and his hardihood in expressing them that made him a noted character . His individuality was strongly marked in many ways . He was ueither a fluent nor a graceful speaker ; but he possessed much originality of thought and piquancy of expression , unusual felicity of illustration , clearness and precision of statement , considerable dialectic power , a certain ingenuousness , real or assumed , and no small stock of robust wit , - qualities which never failed to gain him the ear // of his audience . Yet he offended more than he pleased : for even then he displayed the self-sufficiency and indulged in the didactic arrogance and repulsive brusqueness of speech for which he has since become notorious . Outside of the parliamentary sphere , he found sympathy and applause only with the party of which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , liberal-minded people in Germany his political professions were so utterly repugnant that even the respect usually accorded to sincerity was refused to him . But he incurred not so much hatred as contempt , and more ridicule than denunciation , for his conservative extravagancies . The public knew well enough that there was not the least danger of a realization of his mediaeval ideal of government . He was the butt of the wits of Berlin , and a standing figure in the Kiadderadats ch , the Prussian Punch . The favor of the ministry was sufficient to raise Herr von Bismarck to the highest diplomatic rank after an apprenticeship of only three months . But it could not , by appointing him ambassador , transform him at once into a finished diplomatist . He had a great deal to learn in his new profession , and the school he entered was by no means an easy one . If it had been the special intent of his patrons to disgust him with his new calling in the shortest time , they could have assigned him to no better field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was none the less full of individual vigor and enterprise , and longed for action and distinction . An impulsive , energetic nature like his was entirely out of place in the stagnant atmosphere of the Diet . That cumbersome , unwieldy assembly , after its resuscitation in 1850 , through the efforts of Austria and her satellites , moved with its wonted slowness in the old pedantic rut . His patience was put to the sorest test . Still , with that talent for adaptation which helped him over so many difficulties in his subsequent career , he soon accommodated himself to the circumstances surrounding him , and made the most of his position . His task was anything but easy . Austria and the minor states could not forget that in 1848-49 the imperial crown of Germany had been within the grasp of Prussia . Not content with their great triumph at Olmiitz , they continued to treat her as a still dangerous // foe , whose every move had to be watched and thwarted . Periodical encounters with- these adversaries formed the main incidents of the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained at Frankfort . In his new post he threw off at once , but perhaps more from a sense of duty than from conviction , whatever sympathies lie bad for Austria , and served the Prussian interest with the utmost devotion . His duties were varied and comprehensive enough to make him by degrees an adept in his new calling . He had hardly assumed his official functions when he was required to deal with the important subject of the reconstruction of the customs-union . This was undertaken by Prussia in 1851 , with a view to enlarging the territorial extent of that economic institution , and through it of her own political influence in Germany , and , after two years of diplomatic manomvring , was carried , in spite of the desperate opposition of Austria . To this auspicious result Bismarek contributed not a little . Next the Crimean War , in its reaction on German affairs , afforded him another opportu-. nity for rendering valuable services . Besides these , the affair of Nenfch*tel , the chronic Schleswig-Holstein imbroglio , and various minor matters , occupied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in point of natural abilities he had no superior among them , and that he mastered their profession with astonishing quickness . Jealousy of the power he represented was transferred to the person of the representative . His disregard of stiff forms and hollow conventionalities , freedom of official intercourse , frankness in telling unpleasaiit truths , no less than the consciousness of superiority which he often showed , and the imperious tone he assumed at times , could not fail to make him more enemies than friends at the Diet . The unfriendly character of his relations with Count Rechberg , the Austrian ambassador , especially , was matter of notoriety , and many anecdotes illustrating it were in circulation at the time . The experience of Bismarek at . Frankfort had a decisive bearing upon his future career . It opened his eyes completely to the historical antagonism between the dynastic interests of Prussia and Austria . From year to year he saw more and more clearly that they were irreconcilable , and that they must // necessarily lead , sooner or later , to a conflict , upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in Germany would depend . As this opinion became more firmly settled in his mind , his conviction also became clear that the decision of the rivalry in favor of Prussia could be made the stepping-stone to lasting fame . Daring and ambitious , he resolved to make the accomplishment of this the great aim of his life . In 1862 , documcuts , the authenticity of which has never been questioned , were published in several German periodicals , which went to show , that , in accordance with this resolution , he had , as early as 1856 , elaborated a plan for remodelling the map of Central Europe . He put it in the form of a memorial , which he submitted , soon after the conclusion of the Peace of Paris , to king Frederick William IV. , and a little later to Count Walewski , then French Minister of Foreign Affairs . It recommended the formation of a close alliance between France , Russia , and Prussia , for mutual territorial aggrandizement . Russia was to be extended to the Vistula ; France to annex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank of the Rhine ; Prussia was to be permitted to organize a new German federation under her own leadership , with a view to the eventual absorption of the minor states . But the project was not favorably received , either at Berlin or Paris . It was , in fact , chimerical , and proved less the wisdom of its author than an earnestness of purpose , a boldness of conception , and , above all , a readiness to employ any means for the accomplishment of ends he considered legitimate , - traits of character which were developed more fully in the subsequent phases of his public life . Although Bismarck was thoroughly cured at Frankfort of his former veneration for Austria and the existing federal organization of Germany , his political views were not modified in any other respect . His mind remained impervious to the truth that the people as well as the sovereign possesses rights . All liberal ideas continued to be as repugnant to him as ever . An autocratic monarchy was still to him the most perfect form of government . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farthest in the persecution and suppression of all liberal tendencies . The tide of reaction during the last // part of his stay at Frankfort rose too high for him . His stolid conservatism was one of the reasons of his removal early in 1859 to the more congenial political atmosphere of St. Petersburg , when , consequent upon the accession of Prince William of Prussia to the regency in 1858 , a more liberal era seemed to be dawning upon Prussia and Germany at large . Another motive for his transfer to the Russian capital was his too pronounced sympathy with France and Italy in the differences of those powers with Austria , differences which resulted in the war of 1859 . His leaning towards the adversaries of Austria was owing , not to any partiality for the national cause of the Italians , but to the antipathy he had conceived for the traditional rival of Prussia . But besides this , he had another ground of sympathy with the enemies of the House of Hapsburg . Strange as it may seem , he , the firm believer in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary rights , the mortal foe of all revolutionary outgrowths , cherished a profound admiration for the man , or rather for the political system of the man , who claims to sit on the imperial throne of France by the will of the people . The achievement of autocratic ends by democratic means , the substitution of material prosperity for political liberty , the absolute supremacy in the state of one will , the subjection of all the functions of the body politic to the inspiration of one mind , the merciless destruction of all that stands in the way of this result , - all these features , which constitute the glory of the Second Empire , were captivating to ILJerr von l3ismarck 's imagination . Nor did he confine himself to mere admiration of the " enlightened despotism " of the second Napoleon . As the sequel proved , he became a close imitator of his crafty prototype . His removal from Frankfort did not put an end to the pursuit of his great scheme for raising Prussia to larger territorial extension and political consequence . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with even increased ardor . He not only interested Prince Gortschakoff in it , but , impressed with the belief that the war between Austria and the Franco-Italian allies offered Prussia a grand opportunity for securing a permanent preponderance in Germany , he made // another attempt to win over his government to his project of 1856 , in a modified form . On the 12th of May , 1859 , he addressed a confidential communication to the Prussian Minister of Foreign Affairs , in which he fully disclosed the thoughts then uppermost in his mind . In this exposition , which was brought to light after sleeping for seven years on the shelves of the Berlin Foreign Office , he expressed the conviction , as the result of his eight years ' observations at Frankfort , that the bonds attaching Prussia to the federation fettered her in times of peace and fatally weighed upon her in times of war . This evil , he maintained , Prussia would be obliged , sooner or later , to remedy igni et ferro ; and he held that just such critical penods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In his eyes the condition of things in Austria , France , and Russia seemed at that moment more favorable for bettering the position of Prussia in Germany than it had ever been before . Unfortunately for the author , this urgent plea for a violent overthrow of the federal structure was as little heeded as its predecessor of 1856 . But Bismarek , though keenly disappointed , did not lose courage . He patiently bided his time , which was not long in coming . He remained at St. Petersburg until the spring of 1862 , when he was appointed ambassador to the Court of the Tuileries . He was glad to go , and was no less gladly received by Napoleon and his cabinet , who well knew his sympathies with the imperial regime . But he was not to enjoy the pleasures of the French capital long . He had not been at his new post more than six months , when he was unexpectedly summoned to take a place among the immediate advisers of his royal master . To make clear the cause of this sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussia after his departure from Frankfort . The condition of Prussia when Prince William assumed the regency was such that even a large portion of the conservative party realized the desirableness of a change of rulers as well as of policy . The prestige of the state had been seriously impaired abroad ; and in Germany its influence was far less than that of its rival . Within its own limits , the pitch to which political oppression and spiritual tyranny had been carried duning // the preceding nine years by a servile , bigoted Church , had produced an all but fatal stagnation in public life . But a change for the better , under the rule of the Prince Regent , was hardly expected by the liberal party . The sanguinary record he had made in 1849 , in the suppression of the democratic uprising in Southern Germany , justified a fear of the continuance of a reactionary policy . Great and agreeable was , therefore , the surprise of the friends of political progress , when , soon after assuming the reins of governments he took occasion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make " moral conquests " in Germany , and promised to rule in strict accordance with the constitution and laws . His declarations were received with great popular joy throughout the fatherland , and were universally looked upon as harbingers of an era of comparative liberty and advancement towards national unity . But it appeared , after a time , that the hopes raised by the first utterances and acts of the Prince Regent had been unfounded . Events occurred one after another , between the time he took possession of power and his formal accession to the throne upon the death of Frederick William IV. , that proved him to be still too much imbued with the traditional autocratic predilections of the Prussian monarchs , and too deferential to the so-called legitimate rights of his fellowsovereigns , to warrant expectations either of larger popular liberty or of a decided furtherance of the national aspirations under his reign . What was at first but apprehension grew gradually into a settled belief . That his own subjects , as well as the German nation at large , were right in distrustin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct conflict between royal pretensions and the legislative representatives of the Prussian people . King William desired to make Prussia great , but knew no other road to greatness than military power . Himself a most enthusiastic soldier , he considered the army the main pillar of the Prussian monarchy , and the first interest of the state , calling for his particular care . Long before he became ruler he had conceived and elaborated certain projects for the reorganization and enlargement of the military forces of the kingdom , to the realization of which he devoted himself imme // diately after succeeding to the crown . In February , 1860 , the project of a law was submitted to the lower house of the Landtag by the Minister of War , embodying the army reforms contemplated by the king . According to the terms of the bill , the annual levy of recruits was to be increased from forty thousand to sixty-three thousand men , - the standing army being thereby nearly doubled , - and the length of service on the active and reserve list of the regular forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national guard ( Landwehr ) was no longer to form part of the army proper in time of war . The cost of carrying out the proposed reorganization was estimated at five millions of thalers , and the permanent increase of the war budget at ten million thalers per annum . The heavy addition proposed by this bill to the military burden already weighing upon the people , without any other compensation than a reduction of the aggregate time of service in the regular force and Landwehr from nineteen to sixteen years , staggered the majority of the house . The committee to which the bill was referred reported against it in due course of time , and the house accepted its conclusions . Thereupon the government withdrew the bill , but subsequently brought in a new one , appropriating nine millions of thalers for putting and keeping the army on a war footing for one year . On the promise of the government not to use the money so as to prejudice the final action of the legislative power in regard to the proposed reorganization of the army , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the bill should be modified , the amount was voted . In the session of the following year the house was again persuaded by the same assurance to vote this special appropriation for another fiscal period ; but the notorious fact , that , notwithstanding its positive pledge , the government was using the money to carry out the king 's scheme of reform , had already created so much distrust that the measure prevailed by only a small majority . A new Landtag was elected and met early in 1862 . Owing to the weak foreign policy of the government and its growing illiberality in domestic affairs , the opposition in the house had been reinforced to such an extent as to have become an overwhelming majority . Soon after the opening of the session , a // resolution was carried by the liberals calling on the Minister of Finance for a more detailed statement of the expenditures of the government than the one he was in the habit of submittin* , . The object was to compel the ministry to a formal avowal of the improper employment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to submit a specific budget in future , but refused to exhibit one for the current year . The house , however , insisted upon its demand , and was thereupon dissolved by royal decree . This step on the part of the government ushered in a conflict that was to become one of the most remarkable struggles between king and commons known to history . The dissolution of the house was a formal declaration of war by the sovereign against the legislative power of the realm . The first battle was fought in the elections for a new house , which the government had immediately ordered . Notwithstanding the resumption by the ministry of the old practice of official interference in the canvass , which had been apparently abandoned when William I. ascended the throne , the opposition achieved a complete triumph . Upon the assembling of the new Landtag , the Minister of Finance brought in the specific budget , the demand for which had caused the dissolution of the former house . But the fact that the extraordinary appropriation for the War Department was made to appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government , in violation of its solemn pledge , to treat the reorganization of the army as an accomplished fact . It satisfied the opposition that the ministry had been acting throughout in bad faith , and had insidiously and by false representations obtained the means for carrying out an unlawful pr*ject year after year . The result was , that , September 17 , 1862 , the whole increased appropriation was stricken from the budget by a vote of two hundred and seventy-three to sixty-eight . This was a most emphatic rebuke of the course of the government . But the king was resolved not to yield to the house . He was not only loath to abandon a long-cherished project , but believed that to give way to the representatives of the people would be to lower the royal dignity . There were two ways open to him of overcoming the resistance of the // house , - persuasion , and a determined opposition . Hence , when he found himself confronted by the ministerial crisis consequent upon the rejection of the budget , he felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who had both the ability and the will to employ either method , as occasion might require . The talents , boldness , and energy of Herr von Bismarck were no less well known to him than his zealous conservatism and attachment to the royal interest ; and the ambassador 's name was , moreover , suggested to him by the High Tory leaders who had his ear . The result was , that within tweny-four hours after the vote of the house Bismarck was summoned by telegraph from Paris . He responded so promptly that within forty-eight hours he was able to report himself in person ready to receive the king 's commands . Most men , in view of the existing complications between king and commons , would have thought twice before consenting to assume the responsibilities of the post of chief adviser to the sovereign . Not so Herr von Bismarck . He accepted without hesitation the portfolio of Minister of Foreign Affairs , to which were joined the functions of Minister President . A mind of his bold stamp would naturally make light of the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him altogether , in his satisfaction at having now obtained possession of the power he had so long coveted . In the brilliant prospect suddenly opened to him he saw the long-sought opportunity of fulfilling the great task he had assigned to himself . The impediments that lay between him and his goal were insignificant to his firm will and absolute confidence in himself , and he assumed his new duties and responsibilities without misgiving . At first the new premier seemed to be inclined to make concessions to the overwhelming majority of the house . He withdrew the objectionable appropriation bill , in order , as he asserted , " to temper the existing conflict . " But the opposition wanted positive guaranties from the new chief of the governjnent . A resolution was offered , not only requiring the government to submit its estimates for the current fiscal year , but condemning the use of any portion of the public funds for any object not sanctioned by the house , as a violation of the // constitution . The resolution went to the Committee of Ways and Means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity as a ministerial tactician . With a marvellous combination of flattery and casuistry , of threats and grim humor , he sought to persuade the committee to report against it . Addressing the members with an appearance of frank confidence , he told them that the government was most anxious to avoid all further collision ; that what had occurred was only a proof of the intelligence and capacity of the Prussian people . He claimed that the various branches of the government had co-ordinate rights in the regulation of the public expenditures , and that the legislative power had no absolute veto upon the royal will . Next he tried to dazzle the committee by a revelation of his designs for the aggrandizement of Prussia . " As long as we choose to wear heavy armor upon our small body , we must not fail to make good use of it . Germany looks not to the liberalism , but to the military power of Prussia . We must be fully prepared for action at favorable moments . The problems of the times will be solved , not by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the committee were neither to be cajoled nor imposed upon . The resolution was reported back with a recommendation that it pass ; and the only fruit of his effort was , that from that time forward he became known throughout Germany as " the man of blood and steel . " During the discussion of the resolution in general session Bismarck again tried his best to prevent its passage . But neither his speeches nor the arts he practised in the lobbies were of any avail . He surprised the members by the affability with which he approached them , and the freedom with which he seemed to confide to some of the leaders of the opposition the secrets of his policy . Such condescension on the part of a minister of the crown was extraordinary ; but it did not help him . The resolution passed by a vote of 251 to 36 . No sooner was it passed than Herr von Bismarck threw off the mask . A few days later he appeared in the house with a royal message announcing the prorogation of the obstinate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the king to insist upon the army reforms , and to carry on the government // without a budget . This high-handed proceeding was the signal for a complete rupture between the new ministry and the popular branch of the Landtag ; and the whole liberal public now felt that its misgivings on the accession of Bismarck to power had been well grounded . While the liberal members everywhere met popular ovations , and a bitter outcry was raised on all sides against the premier , he , on his part , retaliated to the utmost extent of his power . He entered upon a crusade against the liberal press . He caused disciplinary proceedings to be commenced against numerous officials who expressed sympathy with the house , and instigated addresses to the king , denouncing the resistance of the house to the royal will , and begging him to persist in his course , with an assurance of the support of the people . All this naturally intensified the indignation against him . The Lafidtag was again convened in January , 1863 . In the discussion of the customary address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bitterness engendered by the acts of the ministry during the recess became speedily manifest . In spite of the threat of the premier that he would advise the king not to receive it , an address was adopted , in which the government was accused in direct terms of a flagrant breach of the organic laws of the state . It was certain that the illegal appropriations for the War Department , again demanded by the ministry , would be again rejected . Foreseeing this , the gov1 eminent was glad to find a pretext in a dispute between the Minister of War and the presiding officer of the house , in which that officer 's right to treat members of the ministry like other members of the house was denied , for again proroguing the Landtag , before a final vote upon the budget should be reached . In Prussia the constitutional advisers of the crown do not , as in Great Britain , merely reflect the will of Parliament . Nevertheless it was a bold step on the part of King William to defy the wish of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the dispute just mentioned , for a change of his ministry . That he thus deliberately followed in the footsteps of the Stuarts was chiefly due to the complete ascendency of his premier over him . But this rapidly acquired sway did not rest solely on the prime-minister 's // devoted support of a pet royal scheme . Herr von Bismarck had dazzled the king 's eyes by a partial unfolding of his grand design for making Germany Prussian . Moreover , his hold of power was strengthened by his social qualities . Notwithstanding his habitual brusqueness in official intercourse , he was an accomplished courtier , and shone in the salon no less than in the council chamber . His polished manners , spirited conversation , and sharp wit , as well as his fondness for the favorite sports of the king , aided him no little in establishing himself quickly and firmly in the royal favor . The popular instinct did not fail to perceive the strong hold Bismarck had on the king . By degrees he came to be considered the evil spirit of the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the popular indignation against him only steeled his nerves , and he soon satisfied his adversaries that he was determined to win , and would shrink from nothing that served his purpose . Shortly after the prorogation of the Landtag , a royal ordinance was promulgated which furnished strong evidence of the purpose of Bismarck to fashion his rule upon the Napoleonic model . The ordinance instituted the very same system for muzzling the press that had been followed in France under the Second Empire . Against this decree the press , in defiance of penalties , protested most energetically . Though scores of criminal prosecutions were commenced against liberal papers , they failed to intimidate them . Protests and remoustrances from municipal bodies and the people at large poured into Berlin , and the law faculties of three universities pronounced the ordinance unconstitutional . The heir-apparent of the crown not only declared publicly at Dantzic that it was promulgated without his knowledge or approval , but likewise addressed letters both to his royal father and to the Minister President in which he protested against the whole prevailing system as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to the king and his father 's angry reply found their way after a time to the press , and made a profound sensation , encouraging the liberal party to continue its struggle for constitutional rights . While this internal feud claimed the largest share of the // attention of the head of the ministry , external questions of grave import likewise occupied him from the very moment he assumed office . In 1860 King William had positively and in rather offensive terms refused to recognize Victor Emmanuel , " the robber-king , " as the Prussian Tories called him , as king of Italy . But a few months before Bismarck took charge of the portfolio of foreign affairs , regard for the commercial interests of Prussia had induced the king to reconsider his resolution and reopen diplomatic relations with the House of Savoy . One of the first acts of the new minister was the transmission of a circular despatch to the diplomatic representatives of Prussia , in which he dwelt at length upon the motives of the Berlin cabinet in recognizing the kingdom of Italy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the annexation policy of the Italian government , nor as an acknowledgment of its title to the unlawfully annexed provinces , but simply as an admission of an accomplished fact . It was a plea in defence of the Berlin cabinet against the charge of inconsistency which had been raised by Austria , and it was not received with much favor . An edifying homily on the evils of arbitrary government , which the pressure of public opinion compelled Herr von Bismarck to deliver to the elector of Hesse for persistently tyrannizing over his subjects , in spite of their resistance and the remonstrances of the Diet , was still less a success . The internal administration of Prussia afforded the elector abundant material for an effective retort . Nor was the premier* s insincerity less patent in his concentration of troops upon the frontier , during the rising of 1863 in Poland . It served to prevent the transmission of arms to the insurgents , and to cut them off from receiving assistance from the Prussian Poles , while he professed that the movement was not made in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prussian territory , as a result of the insurrection . But by far the most serious external complication that Bismarck had to deal with , during the first year of his administration of the foreign office , grew out of the old jealousy between Prussia and Austria . In pursuance of the free-trade policy adopted in 1860 , France had proposed a commercial // treaty to Prussia , the object of which was to stimulate commercial intercourse between the two countries by a mutual reduction of duties . Prussia having accepted the proposal , articles had been signed in March , 1862 . Austria , moved at once by her animosity towards the author of her humiliations in 1859 , and by her chronic distrust of Prussia , immediately commenced a series of attempts to prevent the execution of the treaty . Some of these efforts were peculiarly exasperating to Prussia , as they were designed to give the impression that Austria was more favorable than herself to federal reform and union . Early in 1863 , within a few months after Herr von Bismarck took charge of the Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an angry despatch had been addressed by the new premier to the Vienna cabinet , in consequence of which the relations between Prussia and Austria had assumed a hostile character . After reminding Austria that in 1859 Prussia had not only taken no advantage of her precarious condition , but had even prepared to go to her support , he broadly hinted that under similar circumstances he should not advise the king to pursue a similar course . If Austria refused to go hand in hand with Prussia , she would have to seek another point of gravitation at Pesth . The Austrian government would have done well to bear in mind these ominous words . But the domestic troubles and the want of influence abroad of the Prussian government led Austria to make light of the warning , - a mistake for which she paid dearly . The ill feeling between the two governments was increased by the refusal of King William to attend a conference of German princes at Frankfort , called by Austria for the purpose of making such changes in the federal relations of the German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Francis Joseph in person , at the watering-place of Gastein , and only the urgency of Bismarck caused it to be declined . The reforms proposed by the conference were so superficial , that the great influence now exercised over King William by his premier was hardly needed to lead him to refuse to accept the action of the congress . Everything seemed to tend towards a rupture between the two powers , when within // four months the world was surprised to learn that they had come to a cordial understauding , which speedily ripeued into au alliance offensive and defensive . This was brought about through the agency of the very man whose special delight it had seemed to be to cross Austria in every way . The cause of this unexpected revival of friendship was the Schleswig-Holstein question . The statesmen of Europe had vainly exercised their ingenuity for fourteen years in attempts to solve this perplexing problem , when Bismarck came into power ; and he found it as far from a solution as ever . In the autumn of 1863 the long-pending quarrel reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority of the Diet , in the month of October of that year a resolution ordaining federal execution against the recusant pygmy of a kingdom prevailed by a large majority in the Diet upon the joint motion of Prussia and Austria . The surprising convergence of the policies of the two German powers on this question was due to precisely the same causes as their divergence on every other question . The secret of their new harmony lay in the same inveterate jealousy that ever regulated their mutual relations . Herr von Bismarck perceived as clearly as Count IRechberg , who had attained to the same post in Austria that his former colleague and adversary at Frankfort held in Prussia , that the stubbornness of Denmark had rendered war inevitable . Germany was ablaze with excitement and sympathy for the Duchies , and with eagerness for the summary punishment . of Denmark . Each of the premiers was anxious to take the management of the coming conflict into his own hands , and monopolize whatever advantages might be gained from such leadership . Each wished to control the action of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is nothing on record to show that Count IRechberg had any other aim than to secure for Austria the prestige of leading a popular movement , and to prevent Prussia from turning the contingencies of the war to her own exclusive benefit . But Bismarck had more positive motives , and of larger scope . Ever devoted to his one design of weakening the position of Austria and strengthening that of Prussia in Germany , he re* // solved to make the complications with Denmark both bear substantial fruits to the dynasty he represented , and serve as an instrument for breaking up the traditional coalition of Austria with the minor states , which formed the basis of her predominance aud the main stay of the Diet , as against the interests of the House of Hoheuzollern . For this double purpose he conceived a plan more ingenious than scrupulous , the features of which , even if he had not himself disclosed them a year later before the Prussian parliament , were distinctly revealed by subsequent events . To bring about an alienation between Austria and her princely satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept the London treaty of 1852 as a basis for the solution of the Schleswig-Holstein difficulty . The Diet as such had never recognized this pact . Public opinion in Germany insisted vehemently , that , as Denmark had never pretended to acknowledge its binding force , the great German powers were released from all obligations under it . To uphold this unpopular treaty was the most ill-advised course the Vienna cabinet could possibly take . Yet Herr von Bismarck had no difficulty in persuading Count Reehberg to stand with him on that dangerous ground . Whether the Prussian premier bribed the Austrian to this by promises relative to the distribution of the prospective spoils of the war , or whether Austria , in the blindness of her jealousy , followed his lead without such inducement , remains an open question to this day . But certain it is that Conut Rechberg fell into the snare , and that from the time of the joint motion at the Diet for armed execution against Denmark Austria followed closely and eagerly in the footsteps of Prussia . The calculations of Bismarck proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yielded to popular opinion , opposed the London treaty , and advocated the claims of the Duke of Augustenburg to the sovereignty of the Duchies . They were speedily arrayed in as distinct hostility to Austria as to Prussia . Though successful in his intrigue , the Prussian premier was not long in finding out that to uphold the London treaty reacted very unfavorably against him at home , and involved him in another serious difficulty with the Laudtag. // The Diet having resolved , in December , 1863 , to enforce the federal decrees against Denmark by military execution , and charged Austria , Prussia , Saxony , and Hanover with this duty , it devolved upon Bismarek to appear before the Prussian lower house with a demand for special appropriations for placing part of the army on a war footing . It was in connection with this demand that he was made to feel the great unpopularity of his foreign policy . Some months after the last prorogation of the Landtag , in consequence of the affair with the Minister of War before related , the government had determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvass the admiration of the premier for Louis Napoleon 's methods of government was once more exemplified by the employment of several of his wellknown appliances for obtaining parliamentary support . But reckless as were the efforts of the ministry for the return of a conservative majority , they proved vain . The elections resulted in as large a preponderance of the opposition element as before . The new house met in November , 1863 , and its first act was to pronounce the premier 's press ordinances unconstitutional , and to institute an investigation into the improper interference in the elections by government officials acting under the special orders of the ministry . The great struggle , however , between the ministry and the opposition , as has been already hinted , arose upon the policy to be pursued in the Schleswig-Holstehi difficulty . The opposition was in complete sympathy with the Federal Diet in its antagonism to the execution of the treaty of London , and in its support of the claims of the Duke of Augustenburg to sovereignty in the Duchies . When , therefore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thalers for the extraordinary expenditures of the War Department , and declined to abandon its Schleswig-Holstcin policy , the authority was refused by a vote of two hundred and seventy-five to fiftyone , after a debate marked by such bitterness and personalities that the premier challenged one of the leaders of the opposition to a duel . The refusal to authorize the loan was immediately followed by the prorogation of the house . Under the authority of the // king , certain accumulated savings of the state were unlawfully employed for the extraordinary military expenditures . The Federal Diet was dealt with in a no less high-handed manner , notwithstanding the many popular demonstrations in its favor throughout Germany , and the protests of the minor states . The Diet , in its weakness and its fear of provoking civil war , was obliged to instruct the commanders of the Hanoverian and Saxon contingents , to whom it had intrusted the active execution of the federal decree , to permit the transit of the Prussian and Austrian troops through Holstein . The preparations for the invasion of Schleswig having been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the allies February 1 , 1864 , and in less than three weeks the whole of Schleswig , with the exception of the island of Alsen , was in their possession . So far Bismarck had been successful in the prosecution of his plot . Austria was now fully estranged from the governments of the minor states , and had forfeited the popular sympathy which her reform movements during the two preceding years had created for her . Partly by his pretence of upholding the London treaty , and partly from the fact of having Austria at his back , he had kept the other great powers from interfering in behalf of Denmark . He had secured in addition a fast hold upon the best part of his intended prey . Yet he was still far from complete success . The risk of provoking the active intervention of foreign governments remained . The Saxon and Hanoverian contingents , as the instruments of the Diet , had as yet a firm foothold in Holstein and Lauenburg . The smaller states were no more pliant to his wishes than before , still zealously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was by no means certain that Austria would follow his lead as readily in the future as in the past . But Bismarek 's astuteness was equal to the emergency . He continued to conciliate the great powers by assurances that the integrity of the Danish monarchy would be respected , and that his government was opposed to the agitation in favor of the incorporation of the Duchies with Prussia , which was nevertheless secretly instigated by him both in and out of the kingdom . He thus kept them in a passive attitude , until the ohstinacy // of the Copenhagen cabinet at the London Conference in April , 1864 , caused them to abandon their prote'g* . With his German adversaries he had a harder task , and even found himself obliged to give way to them . He not only failed to induce the Diet to permit the occupation of the principal towns of Holstein by Prussian troops , but was constrained to adopt the demand of that body for the constitution of the Duchies as an independent state under the Duke of Augustenburg . Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ally , who , frightened by the growing agitation for the annexation of the Duchies in various Prussian quarters , took up the policy of the Diet . The two powers declared jointly at the London Conference that " the Duke of Augustenburg had in the opinion of all Germany the strongest claim to the succession to the sovereignty of the Duchies ; that he was sure of being recognized by the Diet ; and that he was , moreover , the choice of the great majority of the people of the three provinces. ** This involuntary concession would have resulted in a miscarriage of Bismarek 's plottings , but for the failure of the Conference , in consequence of the stubbornness of Denmark . He not only escaped this peril , but was rewarded for his timely yielding by the consent of Austria to a vigorous prosecution of the war , in which she had hesitated to join after the expulsion of the Danes from the mainland of Schleswig . Hostilities were reopened by the allied troops with so much vigor that the king of Denmark was compelled to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by which he assigned all his claims to the Duchies to the monarchs of Prussia and Austria . No sooner had the treaty been signed than Bismarck proceeded to revenge himself upon the Diet for its opposition to his policy in the Duchies by requiring the withdrawal of the Saxon and Hanoverian troops from Holstein . To make his contemptuous treatment of that body the more pointed , he addressed his demand directly to the courts of Saxony and Hanover . These evinced sufficient spirit to refer the demand to the Diet ; but the combined pressure of Prussia and Austria made resistance futile , and the troops were recalled , leaving the allies in undisputed possession of the three Duchies. // Bismarck 's longing to annex the conquered territory to the dominions of the Hoheuzollern had now matured into a fixed purpose . But there were two serious obstacles to its realization , - the claims of the Duke of Augustenburg , and the title of Austria , as good as that of Prussia , to a share of the common prey . Both difficulties were formidable , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his projects . An occasion for the active prosecution of his annexation scheme soon appeared . Bavaria , Saxony , and Wurtemberg presented resolutions at Frankfort to the effect that the Diet alone had authority to determine the future political relations of the Duchies , and came within two votes of carrying them . Bismarck lost no time in informing the cabinets of the three kingdoms that he considered their motion as aimed at the sovereign independence of Prussia and transcending the federal authority , and that Prussia would not consider herself bound by it , if it prevailed . At the same time he addressed a despatch to the Vienna cabinet , to the effect that Prussia would not commit herself as to the future of the Duchies , and that the proposition to constitute them an independent state under the Duke of Augustenburg was inadmissible , as prejudicial to the undecided claims of others , and among them that of the Prussian monarch himself . He even went so far as to add the startling suggestion , that the annexation of the Duchies to Prussia would prove not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Austria . It required no little assurance to pronounce the claims of Duke Frederick inadmissible , when not many months had elapsed since the same authority distinctly indorsed those claims . Count Mensdorff-Pouilly , who bad succeeded Count IRechberg as Anstrian Minister of Foreign Affairs , saw the weak points of the Prussian note , and exposed them in a spirited reply . He said that Austria had undertaken the solution of the Schleswig-Holstein imbroglio solely in the general interest of Germany , and would remain true to her original motive ; that , if Prussia had claims to the snccession , they should have been put forth before , and not after , the joint declaration at London ; and that , as Austrian blood had not been shed for the aggran // dizemeut of one German power at the expense of the other , Austria could not consent to an incorporation of the iDuchies with Prussia without corresponding territorial compensation . The immediate effect of this rebuff was a radical change in the relations of the two powers . The humiliating conclusion was forced upon the Austrian government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hands of an unscrupulous intriguer , who , having accomplished his purposes , was now ready to cast his ally off . It saw , that , instead of foiling , as it had hoped , the ambitious schemes of its rival , it had only promoted them . Thenceforth it used its best endeavors to conciliate the minor states and unite with them in a common policy . The revelation of Bismarek 's plan of annexation led to the most imposing demonstrations on the part of the people of the Puchies of their preference for an autonomous government under the Puke of Augustenburg . The larger portion of the nobility , the clergy , the officials of the civil service , the whole business community , and the people at large , expressed themselves in the most decided manner against the Prussian policy . This reluctance to submit to Prussian rule was mainly due to the illiberal domestic policy so persistently pursued by the Bisumarek ministry . Had Bismarck been willing to abandon his anti-constitutional practices in Prussia , he would have encountered no such universal hostility in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Il3ismnarck to proceed to his goal by a less direct course . On the 21st of February , 1865 , in a despatch addressed to the Vienna cabinet , he offered to agree to the union of the IDuchies as an independent state under the rule of Duke Frederick , but on conditions which would have made the new state the merest vassal of Prussia . The proposal was rejected by Count Mensdorff , who objected to each and every one of the conditions , as contrary to the letter and spirit of the existing federal pact . Encouraged by the growing discord between Berlin and Vienna , the minor states now renewed their efforts to baffle the designs of their Prussian adversary . In the month of March , Bavaria , Saxony , and the Grand Duchy of ilesse proposed to the Diet to summon Austria and Prussia to surrender the government // of Holstein to Duke Frederick . During the discussion of the motion , Herr von Savigny , the Prussian ambassador , under the special instructions of Bismarek , made the decisive declaration , that his government considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as incapable of establishment , and that the Prussian recognition of the claims of the Duke at the London Conference had been but a temporary expedient . Austria , however , supported the motion , and it prevailed . No sooner was it adopted than Savigny filed a protest , denying the right of the Diet to pass upon the future relations of the Duchies , and declaring that Prussia would pay no regard to the resolution . A reaction in public opinion concerning the question of the Duchies had already arisen in Prussia . The successes obtained by the Prussian troops in the war against Denmark had flattered the military pride of the people . A feeling arose , shared alike by the supporters of the ministry and a considerable portion of the opposition , that Prussia was entitled to a substantial compensation for her sacrifices of blood and treasure . The belief was general that national unity could be accomplished only by the same surrender of their sovereign rights , on the part of the several autonomous states , which Herr von Bismarck proposed to exact from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government then put the cause of national unity in advance of the interests of royalty , as he did a year later , it would have been easy for him to revolutionize public opinion in his favor . As it was , Bismarck was emboldened to pursue a more aggressive policy , and as early as the spring of 1865 it looked as if he meant to provoke a collision with Austria . Without any previous notification to the Vienna government , it was announced on the 3d of April that the king of Prussia had directed the removal of the station of the royal navy from Dantzic to the port of Kid in Holstein . Austria protested , and ordered two men-of-war to that port , to protect her rights of joint dominion ; but Prussia persisted , and carried out her purpose . To prevent its accomplishment by force would have involved the risk of war , for which the Vienna cabinet was as yet unprepared . Shortly after this incident , // Bismarck made pretence that the exercise of the sovereign functions by Duke Frederick in Holstein , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demanded his expulsion . In consequence of this demand , which was refused by the Vienna cabinet , and the vigorous measures taken by the Prussian government to repress popular agitation in the Duchies in behalf of the Duke , the friction between the two powers steadily increased during the spring and summer of 1865 ; and it was plain that Bismarck was even then willing to push matters to a crisis . But King William was not yet prepared to adopt his premier 's policy . His disinclination to draw the sword , and the equally peaceful disposition of the Austrian emperor , averted the danger for the time , and gave rise to a compromise in the form of the treaty of Gastein , concluded August 14th by Count Bismarck and Count Blome , and subsequently ratified at a meeting of the two monarchs at Salzburg . By its terms the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein were to be separately administered by Prussia and Austria , and the latter power , in consideration of two and one half millions of thalers , ceded all her claims to Lauenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing about this arrangement , Herr von Bismarck was soon after raised to the hereditary dignity of a count of the realm . The new treaty was another great gain for Prussia , and another grievous blunder on the part of Austria . While the former strengthened her hold upon the Duchies , the latter not only failed to secure the permanent maintenance of peace , but , in abandoning , as she virtually did , the cause of the Duke , lost also the best means of thwarting the designs of Prussia , and opened anew a gulf between herself and the minor states . Although Austria now proceeded to carry out her part of the Gastein convention with a most confiding disregard of her own interests , and consented to join Prussia in checking all attempts at Frankfort , in the Duchies , and in the Diet , to protest against the treaty and reach a different solution of the problem , her fidelity to her engagements was of no avail . Count Bismarck looked upon the Gastein arrangement simply as another step towards the great end he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being satisfied with having obtained a firm grasp upon two of the Duchies , he was resolved not to stop until the third had been added to his spoils . In pursnance of the treaty of Gastein , the two contracting powers had each appointed a military officer of high rank to act as governor of Schleswig and Holstein respectively . The Austrian governor , Baron Gablenz , did not repress the popular demonstrations in Holstein against the policy of the allies with the same violence as the Prussian governor , General von Manteuffel , in Schleswig . His milder sway was taken advantage of by Count Bismarck , who , under date of January 20 , 1866 , gave the cabinet of Vienna to understand that the character of the Austrian administration of Holstein could not fail to disturb the amicable relations between the two powers . A few days later an event took place which furnished him with a better pretext for bringing about a rupture . On the 23d of January a meeting was called of the sympathizers with the people of the Dnchies throughout Germany at Altona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gablenz , but was subsequently permitted to take place upon the assurance of the leaders that no formal resolutions should be voted by the assemblage . The authorization of this meeting , one of the most imposing popular gatherings ever held in Germany , was immediately seized upon by Count Bismarck as a pretext for the despatch of his famous note of January 28th to Vienna , in which he took the ground , that , in not opposing more energetically the popular demonstrations in Holstein , Austria was pursuing an aggressive course , which , by fostering revolutionary practices , endangered the rights of Prussia . Throughout this document he assumed the tone of injured innocence , lamenting that his strong faith , born of the days of Gastein and Salzburg , in the perfect accord of the policy of the two governments with regard to their common enemy , - Revolution , - had now proved a delusion . The charge against Austria of sympathizing with revolutionists nobody believed less than its author . But had he not instilled this false belief into the mind of the king , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the conclusion of the note , that Austria should thereafter abstain from further encouragement of revolutionary practices , // - a demand which he justified by assuming , that , under the treaty of Gastein , Prussia still had a co-ordinate right of control over the administration of Holstein , - and to announce , that , unless the Vienna cabinet complied , Prussia would consider herself at liberty to act as her interests required . Count Mensdorff , in his reply , denied in very dignified language that Prussia possessed any right of control over the administration of Holstein , and repelled the clarge of revolutionary proclivities , - but at the same time assured the king 's government that Austria would strictly adhere to the treaty of Gastein . Matters had now reached such a pass that the Prussian premier found himself called upon to decide definitively whether to push the existing complications to the extremity of war or to moderate his policy and seek a peaceful solution . He resointely chose the former course , a determination which rcquired no little courage . He could , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great powers . From Napoleon , at an interview at Biarritz a short time before , he had received , as subsequent developments clearly proved , the promise of French neutrality , ( how obtained has never become fully known , ) in case Prussia came to blows with Austria . England was entirely indisposed to intervene actively in a quarrel in which she had not the least practical interest . Russia remembered too well the ungrateful return made by Austria in 1854 , and again in 1862 , for her powerful aid in 1849 , to render it at all probable that she would side against Prussia . Yet these were but negative advantages , and in all other directions the prospect was unpromising . His first obstacle was the great reluctance of the king to go to war with an essentially German state , to whose monarch he was attached by ties of relationship and personal regard . In the second place , while he had nothing to fear from foreign interference , he had at the same time no foreign ally . Again , in Germany , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The popular hostility to the treaty of Gastein was so great that the sympathy excited for his policy by his proposition of February had disappeared . Moreover , the conflict between the crown and the legislative power continued to be a source of weakness to him , for the gap between the two branches of government was rather widened than narrowed in // 1865 . Having met again in January of that year , the house had been more than ever provoked by a decision of the supreme court , pronouncing , in contravention of the constitution , a prominent member of the opposition liable to criminal prosecution for words spoken in debate ; and the ministry persisting in its former attitude concerning the budget , the liberal majority again refused to vote it , whereupon the house was once more prorogued in June . It met again , in no better temper , a few days before Count Bismarck addressed to Austria his January despatches , and it was certain that it would refuse to vote money for a war of the premier 's making . But the premier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these difficulties . As he had obtained the king 's approbation of his previous aggressions by frightening him with the spectre of revolution , so he now overcame his reluctance to an offensive war by persuading him that Austria was bent upon provoking a collision , and that simple self-preservation required Prussia to anticipate the blow . For the next step , the securing of an ally , the way was already paved by the conclusion , in 1865 , of a commercial treaty with the new kingdom of Italy , the acceptance of which by the customs-union he had secured in spite of the remonstrances of Austria and the scruples of a number of the smaller states . This treaty , aside from its economical bearing , had been of great political importance to Italy , as it involved the recognition , by all the contracting states , of the new order of things established in the peninsula in 1859 and 1860 ; and now the eagerness of the Italian rulers to complete the work of national unification , by delivering Venetia from the Austrian yoke , made them ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin cabinet for an offensive and defensive alliance , which were conveyed to them likewise , it may be safely presumed , by the imperial keeper of Count Bismarck 's secrets at Biarritz . Of the third obstacle to his designs , the tenacious opposition of the legislative majority , he rid himself by boldly resorting , in the latter part of February , to a dissolution of the house , after a session of only four weeks . To counteract the effect of this hazardous measure , and stir up popular prejudices against Austria , lie now made use of the very instr*iment of agitation , the // press , for which he had all along professed the most sovereign contempt . The columns of the official and semi-official organs of the ministry at Berlin were filled with allusions to projects of federal reform said to be contemplated by the ministry , and with more or less open attacks on Austria . Lastly , the premier made sure of the " sinews of war " by obtaining the royal consent to a resort to the large reserve fund which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Frederick , now amounting to upwards of thirty millions of thalers , and to a sale of certain railways belonging to the state . The sums thus secured were more than enough to begin a war , and Bismarck knew the martial temper of the Prussian people too well to doubt for a moment , that , the war once begun , he could safely count on procuring all the money which might be needed to bring it to a successful conclusion . While Count Bismarck was thus preparing for a crisis , Austria exerted herself to foil his schemes by countenancing more and more the popular movement for the autonomy of the Duchies . The danger seemed to the Berlin government so serious that on the 11th of March a royal ordinance was promulgated by the governor of Schleswig , by which all agitation , direct and indirect , for the Duke of Augustenburg was constituted a criminal offence in both Duchies , punishable with imprisonment for five to ten years . This brutal decree produced the most intense indignation in and out of the Duchies . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights under the treaty of Gastein , and within five days after its promulgation Count Mensdorff sent a secret circular to all the smaller states , announcing that the Vienna cabinet , in view of the Prussian ordinance , was under the necessity of demanding peremptorily at Berlin whether or not the king 's government really contemplated the overthrow of that treaty . Should the answer be unsatisfactory , the imperial government would refer the question of the Duchies for ultimate decision to the Diet , and call the attention of that body , in view of the threatening attitude of Prussia , to the ninth article of the federal pact , requiring the protection by the Diet of one member of the federation from the aggressions of another . // To the Austrian ambassador at Berlin Count Bismarek denied all intention of violating the treaty , but refused to enter into any explanations . it so happened that it was in his power to make a telling retort ; for though Prussia had already taken some initiatory steps towards placing her army on a war-footing , it was a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its adversary in preparing for war . The studied sullen silence which Count Bismarck had preserved during a whole month had had the desired effect of inspiring Austria with fear of a surprise , and of leading her to take what were deemed indispensable precautions by a limited concentration of troops along the northern frontier of the empire . Considering the well-known greater efficiency of the Prussian military system , which rendered it possible to marshal the forces of King William in their full strength in one third of the time required to assemble those of Francis Joseph , the Vienna cabinet was justified in being on its guard . But* its action at the time furnished the Prussian premier , who well understood the moral advantage of placing Austria in the light of an aggressor , with an effective argument , of which he made speedy use . On the 24th of March , he addressed , in his turn , a confidential circular to the courts of the minor states , in which he raised the charge of hostile designs against Austria , and in support of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mensdorff had doim , he enumerated in detail the warlike steps which he said the Vienna government had already taken . Assuming his charge to be thereby proved , he informed the several states that the paramount duty of self-defence rendered it incumbent upon Prussia to make counter preparations , and accordingly he desired to know to what extent Prussia could rely on their active assistance , in case Austria proceeded to an aggressive war . At the same time he shrewdly represented the existing complications as another illustration of the utter insufficiency of the old federal structure , and intimated an intention of making some definite propositions for remodelling it at no distant day . That he was very much in earnest the minor states were forced to believe by the promulgation of royal orders , under date of March 28th and 29th , summoning a large portion of // the furloughed Prussian soldiery to their colors . Nevertheless , there remained to the small potentates sufficient courage simply to refer Count Bismarck to article ninth of the federal pact , as affording an ample remedy for all his grievances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipients of the Prussian circular , had deemed it his duty to take coonizance of it , in order to deny the warlike purposes therein attributed to his government . This he did in very emphatic and unequivocal terms , through the imperial ambassador at Berlin , who was ' instructed to declare to Count Bismarek , in the name of the Emperor , that nothing was farther from the thoughts of his Apostolic Majesty than an aggressive policy towards Prussia , - that , on the contrary , he was firmly resolved upon a strict observance of the provision of the federal constitution which forbade the members of the federation to settle difficulties among themselves by force . Coupled with the note was a special request to submit it to King William . It was , no doubt , at the instance of the latter that Count Bismarck replied in a rather conciliatory tone . While defending his own course by again referring to the Austrian armaments , he , on behalf of his royal master , responded to the personal assurances of the Emperor , to the effect that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an offensive war . Nothing has ever placed in doubt the perfect sincerity of Austria in these assurances . But the same can not be said of Count Bismarek 's reply ; for on the very day on which he made known to the Anstrian ambassador the King 's answer to the Emperor 's message , he signed a treaty for an offensive and defensive alliance with Italy . In signing this treaty he was guilty both of a piece of double-dealing towards Austria , and of a direct breach of the still subsisting federal obligations of Prussia , which strictly prohibited her from entering into a coalition with a foreign state against any member of the federation . Italy , however , agreed to nothing dishonorable on her part . Though eager to accept the proffered aid for wresting Venetia from the clutches of her oppressors , she did not wish , even for this end , to ally herself unreservedly to a despotic government , and hence engaged to co-operate with Prussia against Austria only on condition that the principle of national // unity for which she contended should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that liberal internal reforms should be inaugurated in Germany through Prussian agency . This is fully established by the tenor of the instructions of General Govone , who negotiated the treaty , in which distinct reference is made to the promise of Prussia to convoke a national German parliament . Thus Germany appears to be in no small degree indebted to Italy for whatever aid the cause of unity and liberty within her borders received through the war of 1866 . Yet it would be unjust to impute to Count Bismarck any hesitation to agree to the Italian conditions . Although still unfriendly to the progress of liberalism , he was too clearsighted not to perceive the immense moral force that might be derived from the introduction of popular elements into the coming struggle . In return for the promise of Venetia , Italy engaged to assist Prussia with all her military resources in bringing about the severance of all political connections between Austria and the rest of Germany . Count Bismarck hastened to make good his word . Within twenty-four hours after the signing of the treaty , the Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a national representative assembly , to be elected by universal suffrage , whose business it should be to deliberate upon propositions for the reconstruction of the federation to be submitted by the Diet . Accompanying the motion was a lengthy exposition of the motives of the Berlin government for this step , which was a masterpiece of diplomatic writing . After proving the necessity for federal reforms , not so much from reasons of his own as by quotations from Austrian declarations to the Diet in former years , and tracing the failure of all previous projects to their want of thoroughness , he adduced his reply to the Austrian proposition of 186* to show that he had been early in favor of giving the people a voice in the reconstruction of the fatherland . With characteristic boldness he then proceeded to demonstrate that universal suffrage was the only sure remedy for the prevailing evils ; but , lest the ultraconservatives of the Diet should be appalled at this sudden profession of extreme democratic views , he softened its effect by alleging that his government had had the less hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inasmuch as it firmly believed it would lead to the preservation rather than the destruction of monarchical institutions , - a conclusion for which he was obviously indebted to observation of the working of universal suffrage in France . The Prussian circular of March 24th had prepared the members of the Diet for some such movement on the part of Count Bismarek , but they did not dream of being invited to accept so radical a proposition ; nor did they stand alone in their astonishment . All Europe was amazed at this sudden display of democratic leaning on the part of one whose whole record had been that of a bitter enemy of popular rights in general , and of parliamentary institutions in particular . Nobody believed the conversion genuine . The proposition was universally considered a mere strategic move for a temporary purpose , like the recognition of the claims of the Duke of Augustenburg . Even in Germany the opinion prevailed at first that it was a mere bid for popular sympathy , and the liberal party were in no haste to welcome it . Austria and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to act upon Prussia 's motion , and weeks elapsed before anything was done about it in the Diet . Meantime there was a most lively exchange of diplomatic missives between Berlin and Vienna . Count Mensdorff , who was as yet unaware of the Prussian arrangement with Italy , annonneed that the Emperor , in order to give an unequivocal assnrance of his anxiety for the maintenance of peace , had ordered his ambassador at Berlin to lay before the King 's government a detailed official statement of all the military preparations so far made in the empire . He also expressed the hope that King William would now substantiate his pacific professions by countermanding the orders issued in the latter part of March to mobilize a portion of the army . To this Count Bismarck replied , that , as Austria had first armed , it was her part to lead in disarming . Count Mensdorff promptly declared that his government was ready to order all the troops on the northern frontier back to their former stations , provided Prussia positively engaged to do the same . The Prussian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Austrian disarmaments , for he well knew that Austria would find it im // practicable fully to carry out her part of the agreement , for the simple reason that she had now more than one foe to deal with . Within a short time the attitude of Italy had become so menacing , that the Vienna cabinet was suddenly confronted by the alternative of either modifying its offer to disarm or of being taken unprepared by an attack from the South . Hence , at the last moment , Count Mensdorff was obliged to notify the Berlin government , that , while Austria was ready to fulfil her agreement north of the Alps , the situation in Italy precluded her return to a peace footing in Venetia . This was just what Count Bismarck had calculated upon . In his reply , after coolly denying the notorious fact of the Italian armaments , he made known the determination of his government not to disarm , unless Austria did the same in every part of her dominions . This was the last of the mutual propositions to disarm . Hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schemes , when another arose , on which he and his plans alike barely escaped shipwreck . From the moment of the promulgation of his project for a national parliament , he had become an object of suspicion to his old political friends . They were seized with apprehensions that he had suddenly been converted to the obnoxious principles which they had so long combated under his leadership . Their distrust quickly passed into outright hostility , and they began to prejudice the King against his premier . The Vienna cabinet , in connection with its last effort to bring about a mutual disarmament , having offered to obtain for Prussia the cession of certain strategic points in the Duchies , provided she would consent to their autonomy under Duke Frederick , the Tories strove to make this a means of driving the premier from power . They persuaded the King to direct the Count , who was opposed to taking any notice of the Austrian proposition , to reply in courteous terms , regretting the inability of Prussia to accept the proposed compromise , but reaffirming the willingness of Prussia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offering to treat on liberal terms for the cession of Austria 's claims to the Duchies . Had Francis Joseph listened to this offer , Count Bismarck would have been obliged to tender his resignation ; but Austria would not entertain King William 's proposal . // Besides these proceedings with Austria during April and the early part of May , Count Bismarck had some sharp passages with the Diet and the governments of the minor states . The majority of the former , although afraid to reject his project of a national parliament , were anxious to make all possible delay , and had done nothing at the end of a fortnight beyond referring the project to a special committee , and adopting a motion calling on Prussia to state in detail what functions she proposed for the new parliament . To this call Count Bismarck flatly refused to respond , unless the Diet previously fixed a day for the convocation of the parliament , - and this on the not very flattering ground , that , without such direct pledge , lie should have no faith in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration . Next , Saxony , which , following the example of Austria , had placed her little army on a war footing , was given to understand , that , unless satisfactory explanations were received , Prussia would find herself obliged , in view of the strategic position of the former , to take proper military precautions to insure her safety in that quarter . But Baron Beust , the head of the Saxon cabinet , and an inveterate opponent of Prussia and partisan of Austria , whose political destinies he was six months later called upon to fashion , insisted upon the right of Saxony , under existing circumstances , to prepare for her defence , and announced his determination to submit the case to the Diet , to which Prussia should have made her complaint . This strong position Count Bismarck adroitly tried to turn by contending that Prussia was the threatened party , and had a right to expect from the Diet that it would compel Saxony and Austria to disarm . He added , that , should the central federal power fall short of its duty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her own security . A motion in the Diet , by Bavaria , Wurtemberg , Hesse , and other states , to request all members of the federation that had made preparations for war to return to a peace footing , proved equally futile . Then followed a final attempt by the great powers , mainly at the instance of the British government , to bring about an amicable arrangement . Their invitation to Prussia , Italy , and Austria to meet them in conference at Paris was readily ac // cepted by the two first-named states . Count Bismarek was too crafty not to perceive that his seeming eagerness to accept mediation would do much to relieve him from the charge of deliberate provocation of Austria , and that there was not the least probability that anything would come of the conference . lie was fully aware , that , as England and France favored the cession of Venetia to Italy , the majority of the conference was sure to recommend it to Austria , - a mode of settlement to which that proud power would never consent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Venetian question a conditio sine qua non of her participation in the conference , and , in view of the now recognized fact of the PrussoItalian alliance , having no longer faith in the efficacy of any efforts to preserve peace , at once resolved upon a line of conduct that would secure to her , in the event of war , both the active aid of the smaller states and the sympathy of the German people . On the 1st of June the Austrian ambassador announced to the Diet , that his government , wholly despairing of an arrangement with Prussia concerning Schleswig-Holstein , in pursuance of the intention announced in its despatch of April 27th , now formally referred the controversy to the central federal authority , and would , moreover , convoke the Estates of Holstein at an early day , in order to give the people of the Duchies a voice in the determination of their destiny . This move gave Count Bismarck what he had been anxiously awaiting , a plausible cas*is be lii . Two days later , he made an emphatic protest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagrant violation of existing treaties . To prove this , the Prussian Moniteur of the following day published for the first time the terms of a secret convention , concluded between the two powers when they formed their alliance against Denmark , by which each of the contracting parties pledged itself not to take any step affecting the future relations of the Duchies , without the consent of the other . Nor did he content himself with a simple protest . As though determined to cut off all remaining possibility of a peaceful settlement , he , in the famous circular despatch of June 4th , made a fierce attack upon the Vienna cabinet . The records of diplomacy show no // paper more offensive than this , either in form or substance . The main charge , that the government of Austria had tried to make war inevitable in order to obtain an excuse for the certain bankrnptcy of the empire , was without the slightest foundation in fact . The effect of this manifesto throughout Europe was to confirm the general conviction of the utter unscrupulousness of its author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hazards . Bnt Count Bismarck did not confine himself to diplomatic weapons . On the 5th of June , the Vienna cabinet , through the military governor of Holstein , issued a decree convoking the Estates of that Duchy . As soon as intelligence of this reached Berlin , instructions were telegraphed to the military governor of Schleswig to march his troops forthwith into Holstein , and re-establish the statns anterior to the treaty of Gastein , which , according to the Prussian construction , the action of the Austrian government had abrogated . On the 7th the Prussian columns crossed the Holstein frontier . The Austrian forces , being too weak to resist , and having orders from Vienna to retreat , fell back before them . In a few days the whole of the Duchy was in the hands of the invaders , and their commander , in obedience to his instructions , proceeded at once to wipe out all traces of Austrian rule by removing all officials acting under its authority . Simultaneously he extinguished all agitation in favor of Duke Frederick , by dissolving all political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holstein was virtual war ; but a fortnight elapsed before the actual clash of arms . Count Bismarck made use of this interval to turn as far as possible the cnrrent of public opinion to the side of Prussia by urgiug on projects of federal reform . The committee of the Diet , having this matter in charge , with incomprehensible blindness failed to see , that , the more the Diet resisted , the more its adversary could and would demand . It was the stubbornness of this infatuated body that enabled him to carry what he cared much more for than concessions in the interest of the people , - the exclusion of Austria from the reconstructed federation . But before he could make this final move , his Tory enemies pre* // vailed on the King to send a special envoy to the Emperor with a last proposition for a compromise . The refusal of the Emperor to entertain it having been telegraphed to Berlin , the King at once consented to the transmission of a circular despatch to the governments of all the minor states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an amplification of the several features of the project already laid before the IDiet , with some vital amendments . One of these provided for the exclusion of all Austria , German and nonGerman , from the proposed new federation ; another , for the election of a national legislature by universal suffrage in the manner fixed in the federal constitution of 1849 , - the same which the Count sixteen years before had delighted to flout ; and a third , for the division of the military forces of the reconstructed federation into a northern and southern army , with the kings of Prussia and Bavaria as commanders . No man comprehended better than Count Bismarck that only by force of arms could Austria be made to resign her historical position as a German power , and that his proposition was tantamount to a declaration of war . But the outbreak of hostilities was hastened by an equally decisive step on the part of Austria . On the 11th of June the Austrian ambassador informed the Diet that the recent events in Holstein placed his government under the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a view to the protection of the members against the threatened attack of Prussia . On the 14th the motion prevailed , in spite of the earnest protest of M. de Savigny in behalf of Prussia , who announced that his government would consider the federation dissolved by such a virtual declaration of war against one of its members , and would act accordingly . In consequence of the vote of the Diet , Count Bismarck summoned Hanover , Saxony , and Electoral Hesse to declare themselves openly for or against Prussia , and an answer within twenty-four hours was demanded . Their replies being unsatisfactory , another day saw three hundred thousand Prussian soldiers in motion against them , and the Seven Weeks ' War fully inaugurated . A superficial survey of the relative strength and resources of the contending parties led the majority at that time , on // both sides of the Atlantic , to the erroneous conclusion that Prussia was engaged in a most perilous venture , much more likely to ruin herself than Austria . That public opinion throughout Europe , outside of Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true as that even in Germany , outside of Prussia , his partisans were comparatively few , and all parties were still making common cause against the " man of blood and steel . " The conservatives saw in him a reckless intriguer , who shrank no more from trampling upon the sovereign rights of the small princes than from employing revolutionary means in the pursuit of his ends . The liberals hated him still as the arch-enemy of liberty , with whom might went much farther than right . The attempt to assassinate him , on the 6th of May , by an enthusiastic South German youth misled by ardent love of country , exemplified the intensity of this hatred . Distrusting his sincerity , they spurned his offer of organic reconstruction on a liberal basis . Even in Prussia the maority of the liberal party , while anxious to see his reform scheme prevail , as promising a substantial gain to the cause of unity and liberty , had as yet no genuine confidence in him , and were above all averse to the realization of their political desires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , as a remedy for mutual grievances among states of the same nationality , was manifested in a most signal manner in the months preceding the outbreak of hostilities . With the single exception of Breslan , the capital of Silesia , the municipal bodies and chambers of commerce of the most important cities in the kingdom addressed resolutions to the king to the effect that the political ends for which resort to the sword was threatened could be more effectively attained by a liberal domestic rule and a frank appeal to the patriotism of the German nation . How deep was the popular feeling against war was further shown by the extreme reluctance , and in many cases open refusal , of the levies of the Landwehr in different parts of the kingdom to obey the royal summons to arms . Nevertheless , the odds against Count Bismarek were not so great as they appeared to be . The Prussian army was ar superior in numbers , organization , equipment , and intelli // gence to the force it was to encounter . The disaffection of the Landwehr was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of discipline , as the sequel proved , made it as reliable and efficient as any other part of the army . Again , the letter of the French Emperor to his Minister of Foreign Affairs , under date of June 11th , in which the facts of the Biarritz interview with the Prussian premier were for the first time fully disclosed , and the imperial writer approvingly recognized the necessity of a territorial aggrandizement of Prussia , gave positive assurance of French neutrality on the eve of the war . Then the presence of mind and bravery of Count Bismarek , on the occasion of the attempt to shoot him in the streets of Berlin , and the popular abhorrence of political assassination , produced a growing sympathy for the man , which gradually extended to his cause . Furthermore , the adroitness with which he was by degrees forcing the SchleswigHolstein question into the background , and bringing his liberal programme for the reconstruction of Germany to the front of the political stage , every day added to his friends . So marked became this reaction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dissolving the Landtag and ordering new elections , even before the firing of the first shot had consolidated public sentiment in hearty support of the war , as he was confident it would , from the very composition of the Prussian army , which makes it in the literal sense of the words a " people in arms . " The result of the primary elections , which took place before the commencement of hostilities , was the return of a government majority to the new house . In all Count Bismarck 's career there is no more striking proof of the resolute boldness and intense energy of his nature than the spirit which he infused into the conduct of the war . The decision of the controversy being once referred to the cannon , every power and resource was devoted to the one end of succeeding in what he knew would be a struggle of life and death . Every instrumentality , no matter what its character , likely to aid him , was welcome to him . His programme included the kindling of domestic insurrection in Austria , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that purpose . The impetuosity with // which the Prussian hosts swept down their enemies , north and south and east and west , was largely due to his inspiration . He was convinced that a short and decisive campaign could alone prevent the conflict from becoming a general one , involving all Europe ; and the course and result of the war furnished abundant proof that he succeeded in impressing this conviction upon those who had the conduct of it . The needle-gun having taken the place of the pen , Count Bismarek might now have fairly sought a well-earned and much-needed rest . Yet he had no thought of seeking a respite from his incessant labors , while the conflict he had prepared was being fought out in the field . He realized that the uncertainties of war might at any moment produce a turn of affairs requiring his instantaneous interference . Hence he would not have remained at Berlin , even if his sovereign had not likewise considered his presence in the field indispensable . So , donning the uniform of a major of heavy cavalry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to his person throughout the campaign . The marvellous rapidity with which the vaunted martial power of Austria was broken in Bohemia rendered his services necessary even sooner than had been expected . King William had reason to congratulate himself on the attendance of his premier , when , in the night after the Battle of Sadowa , a despatch reached the royal headquarters , in which the Emperor Napoleon announced the cession of Venetia to him by Francis Joseph , and his purpose to exchange the part of absolute neutrality for that of mediator . From that moment Count Bismarek again took the helm , and retained it till the close of the war . The problem of foiling the shrewd move of Austria , meant to make a neutral out of Prussia 's ally , and an enemy of neutral France , was a most delicate one . But for the skilful and at the same time resolute course of the prime-minister , Prussia would have reaped much less benefit from the war than she eventually did . While he accepted Napoleon's. offer of mediation , the rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention , he declined to accede to the suggestion of an armistice without a previous positive agreement upon the terms of peace . In the conditions on which // he signified his readiness to treat , and which he sent by a special envoy to Paris , he boldly claimed the territorial aggrandizement of Prussia , the construction of a new federation under her leadership , and the severance of all political ties between Anstria and Germany . These ends he had determined to secure at all hazards . With equal decision he met the counter proposition of Napoleon , in which the latter , forgetful of his programme of June 11th , acceded to everything but territorial gains to Prussia . Thanks to Count Il3ismarck 's firmness , his terms prevailed both over the French objections and the hesitation of his own sovereign , whose si , ncere belief in the divine origin of royal power made him reluctant to the last to consent to the overthrow of other thrones for the benefit of his own . The basis for an armistice first proposed by the Prussian premier was finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The negotiations for peace at Nikolsburg he conducted with consummate tact , and the same firm adherence to the great objects for which the war had been waged . Generosity to his enemies , under the circumstances , he considered worse than folly . He was as unyielding as the first Napoleon , and , with the exception of his purposed annexation of Saxony , which had to be given up in the face of the joint opposition of France and Austria , he obtained everything he demanded . Seldom have governments been so thoroughly humiliated as were his adversaries , from haughty Austria down to the humblest of her allies . He could hardly have avoided a feeling of personal exultation , when , one after another , the plenipotentiaries and prime-ministers whose chief aim had been to oppose his every move were compelled to approach him , as he sat in triumph in the ancestral hall of the castle of Nikolsburg , the property of the Austrian premier , to sue for peace . His peremptory refusal to accept Austria 's offices in behalf of the minor states , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separately , looked very much as though he coveted the satisfaction of letting each separately feel his power . Nor did it much avail the South German potentates to appeal to France for protection . They found themselves forced in the end to submit to Bismarek 's terms . // Already , during the Nikolsburg negotiations , the Emperor of the French must have come to the conclusion that Count Bismarck was less accommodating than the recollections of Biarritz had led him to expect . If he had any doubts on the subject , they were dispelled by the Count 's emphatic " No " to the inquiry of the French ambassador at Berlin , whether Prussia did not deem it just and proper to restore the political equilibrium , disturbed by the annexation to Prussia of Hanover , Electoral Hesse , Schleswig and Holstein , Nassau and Frankfort , by the cession to France of a portion of the Prussian territory on the west of the Rhine . This untimely demand for territorial compensation , instead of embarrassing the Prussian minister , proved a marked advantage to him . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for removing the existing internal dissensions in Germany and securing general sympathy for Prussia could not possibly have been found than this evidence of a revival of the historical designs of France upon the left bank of the Rhine , and he made haste to inform the public of his prompt refusal to entertain the French ambassador 's suggestion . Napoleon 's foolish move enabled Bismarck to induce the four South German states , as being sure to suffer first from French extension , to enter into secret treaties for an offensive and defensive alliance with Prussia . This transformation of the deadly enemies of a few weeks before into fast allies , held by the strongest military ties , was certainly not the least remarkable of his achievements in that eventful period . While Count Bismarck 's policy was being irresistibly enforced by the great battles in Bohemia , and the lesser combats in the valley of the Main , another triumph , more peaceful , but not less sweeping , was preparing for him in Prussia . Those victories , besides prostrating Austria and inflicting a deathwound upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ministry at home . The truth , as old as mankind , that the winning cause is ever the popular one , received once more a striking exemplification . Never did success command a blinder worship . Never did people show a shorter memory . The past , with its full measure of outrages upon constitutional rights , was entirely forgotten . Weary of old issues , dazzled // by the refulgence of martial glory , and transported with joy at the brilliant dawn of a new era , the public mind was disposed to overlook the blots upon the record of the central figure in the historical drama . On his return to Berlin , in the early part of August , all Prussia seemed swelling with pride at being governed by a minister whom Europe was now ready to pronounce the foremost of living statesmen . Notwithstanding the fatigues of the campaign , Count Bismarck was allowed no rest from his official labors . At the meeting of the Landtag , however , within a few days after hi* arrival , he had the relief of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house by a powerful and determined opposition , - the elections having resulted in the return of a strong working majority for the government . To the credit of Count Bismarck be it said , that he made no abuse of this change in the political complexioA of that body . Instead of pursuing a vindictive course , his first efforts were directed to effecting a formal reconciliation between the sovereign and the legislative power . He persuaded the king to admit , in his speech from the throne at the opening of the Landtag , the unconstitutionality of the acts of the government , to express a desire for the re-establishment of harmony between the crown and the house , and to ask for the passage of a bill of indemnity . The bill was promptly voted by an overwhelming majority . In return , the premier prevailed on the king to decree full amnesty for all past political offences , on the occasion of the triumphant entry of the victorious armies into Berlin . Good feeling between the government and legislature being thus restored , he applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war . With untiring industry he prepared and submitted to the Landtag , within a few weeks after the opening of the session , bill after bill for the annexation of the states and provinces selected from among the conquests of the war to give territorial compactness to the monarchy , for the civil and military reorganization of the new dominions , for restoring order to the public finances , and laying the foundations of the new federation to be set up on the ruins of the old . Among the earliest measures introduced by him was a law providing for the election of members of the future federal // parliament by universal suffrage . This prompt fulfilment of his most important promise to the people greatly increased the public confidence in him . While he gave no signs of anything like a radical conversion to liberal political principles , his course was so moderate and conciliatory that the Tories of the upper house now began to play the part of opposition to the ministry . More than once , in the course of the session , he was compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government would no longer encourage their ultra-conservatism . His discreet management not only carried all his measures through both houses , but obtained for him a most substantial reward in the form of a donation of three hundred thousand thalers , allotted , at the instance of the majority of the lower house , as his share of the million and a half distributed among the most distinguished conductors of the war , out of the vast indemnities exacted from Austria and her allies . Simultaneously with his arduous legislative labors , he bore the burden of the negotiation of formal treaties of peace with the South German states on the basis of the preliminaries of Nikolsburg . His powers were still further taxed by the necessity of counteracting the intrigues at home and abroad of the dispossessed princes , and of coming to an understanding with the Northern and Middle states as to the terms on which they were to enter the proposed new federation . Owing to the fear of centralization , and the anxious clinging of the small potentates to their rights of sovereignty , the latter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was reached in due course of time , and in pursuance of it the plenipotentiaries of the respective governments met at Berlin late in the autumn for the purpose of framing the organic laws of the " North German Confederacy . " At their first session the Prussian premier submitted the draft of a constitution , in which the features of his reform project of June 11th were produced with such modifications as the events that had intervened required . But it was only by dint of great tact and judicious perseverance , coupled at times with considerable pressure , that the resistance of some of the states to a number of the provisions of the draft was overcome , and , // after months of deliberation , it was adopted substantially in the form desired by him . The next step in the inauguration of the new confederacy was the convocation of the federal parliament . The elections for this body had taken place while the representatives of the governments were elaborating the constitution to be submitted to it . The small fraction of the old opposition party that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to join in the common worship at the shrine of success , had made a gallant canvass . But , as was to be foreseen , the elections resulted in returning a majority for the government . The IReichstag was opened by King William with great pomp and solemnity on the 24th of February , 1868 , and the draft of the constitution was immediately laid before it by Connt Bismarck . As submitted , the proposed fundamental charter was but an ingenious contrivance for strengthening and perpetuating the hold , not so much of the kingdom of Prussia as of the house of Hohenzollern , upon the members of the new confederacy , and indirectly upon all Germany . The tendency of every provision was to this end . While apparently securing to the federate states co-ordinate rights , it really concentrated so much power in the giant leader of them all as to make mere vassals of the smaller sovereignties . Their money , their soldiery , their telegraph , postal , and railroad systems , and other sources of strength , were but to serve to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to give them protection and the other material advantages of unity . In order to secure the greatest concentration and the least limitation of the executive authority in the hands of the Prussian monarchs as hereditary presidents of the confederacy , the chance of legislative interference with their sovereign pleasure was to be reduced to a minimum . For this purpose , contrary to the universal practice in the German legislatures , the members of the parliament were to receive no compensation for their services . The object was to exclude from the federal assembly the liberal leaders of the day , most of whom were men of limited means , and thns to insure the permanent preponderance of conservative elements . Again , the most important prerogative of a representative assembly - the right // of regulating the public expenditures - was to be seriously curtailed by a provision fixing the war budget of the confederacy once for all at an unvarying sum . But the majority of the Reichstag , while willing to give Count Bismarck all reasonable support , was not disposed quietly to accept these illiberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition of the publication of any reports of its debates not officially sanctioned , and the irresponsibility of the executive organs . Instead of the unhesitating coiisent anticipated , Count Bisniiarck found a spirited resistance , when these parts of the constitution came up for discussion . With a discretion and moderation which contrasted most favorably with the pugnacity he had formerly exhibited on similar occasions , he bowed to the will of the majority on all points but that of the gratuitous service of members . Upon this he was found so immovable that the majority had to yield to him . The deliberations of the IReichstag were concluded within two months after the opening of the session , - a despatch of business due mainly to the premier 's urgency , and unparalleled in the parliamentary annals of Germany . Before the close of the session Count Bismarck was able to announce that all the federate governments had assented to the modifications of the original draft of the constitution , and that , as amended , he would submit it for ratification to the legislatures of their respective states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new organic law . A prominent American historian and diplomatist professes to have discovered a strong similarity between the constitution of the North German Confederacy and that of the United States . His discovery will not bear the test of a careful analysis of the two instruments . The powers granted to the legislative body in both are , it is true , substantially the same . But notwithstanding this agreement , the practical value of the legislative functions is far less in the former than in the latter ,  --  and this owing to the vital difference in the composition of the respective law-making bodies , and in the prerogatives of the federal executive . It was , no doubt , from overlooking this difference that this error of judgment arose . The North German parliament , like our Congress , consists of two houses . The lower // house there as here is composed of members elected from the several states , according to population and by universal suffrage . But the upper house is not made up , as our Senate is , of indirect representatives of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federate states appointed by the sovereigns , and intended , not , like the Senators of the United States , to be guardians of the interests of the people , but of monarchical pretensions against possible encroachments of the popular branch . The unequal numerical representation of the several states in the upper house or federal council - Prussia having seventeen votes , and all the rest together only twentysix-constitutes another decided difference . But the greatest divergence of the two constitutions lies in the origin and powers of the respective federal executives . The President of the United States is elected by the people . He at once executes and is subject to the laws of the land . He is responsible to his constituency to the extent of a liability to removal for violations of law . His appointing power is restricted . His tenure of office is limited in point of time . He can neither declare war nor conclude peace , nor make any valid treaties without the consent of the Senate . The President of the North German Confederacy , on the contrary , holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Prussia . The office is hereditary in his dynasty . He not only executes , but makes laws . He is personally irresponsible , and is not under , but above the law . His appointing power is unlimited . He makes war at will , and the consent of the IReich stag to treaties is not required even for such as touch upon matters within the legislative province . The absence of a co-ordinate judicial branch of the North German federal polity is another point of dissimilarity . And , lastly , the very essence and chief aim of the American constitution , as expressed in the fourth section of its fourth article , namely , the protection of the liberties of the people of the States composing the Union , will be vainly sought for in the organic pact of which Count Bismarek was the principal author . The laying of the foundation of the North German Confederacy by the constituent IReichstag was not yet completed , when the Luxemburg question created a grave danger to the // new structure . France sought to obtain , by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had vainly demanded of Prussia after Sadowa . Her intentions had no sooner come to light , through the indiscretion of the cabinet of the Hague , than an intense excitement instantly arose all over Germany . The sanguinary conflicts of the preceding year were at once forgotten , and the people , from the Rhine to the Vistula , and from the Elbe to the iDanube , were animated by the one thought of resisting to the last the demand of their grasping neighbor for a rectification of frontiers , justified solely on the ground that Germany was in a fair way of securing the same boon of unity which France had been enjoying for centuries . Count Bismarck , whether from pure patriotism or from a perception of the impulse certain to be given by foreign aggression to the work of national consolidation under the leadership of Prussia , was in full sympathy with the popular outcry against French presumption . This he clearly demonstrated by the defiant manner in which he made known to the French government the treaties of alliance between Prussia and the South German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time only the contracting powers were aware . It would have been easy for him to rally the whole German people to an enthusiastic support of a contest with France , but he prudently contented himself with convincing that power that the national feeling in Germany was strong enough to overcome all internal discord , and thus honorably avoided the calamity of another war by accepting the proposition to make Luxembnrg neutral territory . Since that settlement , Europe has again and again been alarmed by the apparent prospect of a conflict between France and Germany . But , alive as Count Bismarck has been to the constant danger to which French chauvinisme exposed his country , he has not allowed it to disturb him in his unremitting endeavors to infuse into his creation more and more of political and national vitality . A vast amount of labor remained to be done after the adoption of the federal constitution , in order to insure the healthy development of the infant confederacy . The smouldering discontent in the annexed provinces had to be repressed by a combination of conciliation // and rigor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the monarchy were to be assimilated to those of the old ; and the federate states made to conform their several polities theoretically and practically to federal law . To trace the work of the chief architect of the new political edifice , in all its details , during the last eighteen months , would lead us too far . Suffice it to say , that , with the willing and intelligent aid of a friendly majority during two subsequent sessions of the federal parliament , he added much to the strength which the confederacy derived from the constitution by a series of national reforms , such as freedom of domiciliation , the improvement of the postal system , the introduction of a uniform sy*-tem of weights and measures , and the removal of various obstacles to commercial growth . That there has been in the new confederacy a steady progress towards organic harmony and stability can not be denied . But the work of Count Bismarck is still far from complete . As it stands to-day , it exhibits many imperfections and incongruities , such as the existence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restricted suffrage under the state constitutions . Nor does the builder himself consider his structure complete or perfect . Some defects , which he could remove by a stroke of his pen , he permits to remain for ulterior ends ; others he dares not meddle with at present . It is evident , too , that he still relies mainly on material interests for binding the different parts of the federal fabric more closely together , and is indisposed at present to reinforce their influence by an unhesitating employment of a yet more potent political liberalism . He still seems to make the chicken in the peasant 's pot the chief aim of his internal policy . That the assurance of material well-being would be an inducement to the German people to put up with certain political objections to his rule was no doubt a safe calculation . But that something beyond material prosperity is required to make the great body of the German nation cheerfully follow his lead is shown by the results thus far of his attempts to bring the rest of Germany into the new confederacy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must have been plain , after Sadowa , and a matter of just self-gratulation , // that the union of all the German states into one great empire , under the House of llohenzollern , was reduced to a mere question of time . The preparations for this result have , indeed , occupied his mind , since the autumn of 1866 , quite as much as the consolidation of the confederacy . The article of the treaty of Prague which guaranties to the Southwestern states the right of forming a separate federation , and the animosity still felt by a large portion of this population towards Prussia , have rendered a discreet policy imperative , and he has confined himself strictly to the establishment of material bonds between the North and South . As yet the desire for a closer identification with the North German Confederation has made but little progress south of the Main . The meeting last spring of the customs parliament , at which popular representatives of all Germany , excepting Austria proper , assembled for the first time since 1849 , was a great step forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been obliged to resort to threats of commercial isolation in order to overcome the reluctance of the South German legislatures to approve the new custom treaties , in pursuance of which the parliament was convened ; yet much less was done for future political unity during the session of that body than he had obviously expected , and since its adjournment the opposition to assimilation with Prussia has become more active than before . The South Germans , governments and people alike , if they were disposed to overlook the fratricidal origin of the Northern confederacy , could not shut their eyes to the character of the new political body with which they were expected to unite . The former saw in such a union a sacrifice of sovereign rights , ostensibly for the national good , but really for the benefit of the House of iloheuzollern ; the latter , less liberty , higher taxation , and heavier military burdens . It was not unnatural that neither should be in great haste to be absorbed into Prussia . Despite all obstacles , however , Germany will move steadily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the man whose political practices , if not his theories , have undergone such a radical change within a few years , who has shown such marvellous political tact and foresight , will set his face // against the st#ongest tendencies of the age , and miss the surest means of making his country politically as well as materially one . Hence , even if he be not as yet a full convert to liberal ideas , ( and the continued restraints on freedom of opinion in Prussia indicate that he is not , ) it is very certain that the instinct of self-preservation as well as political necessity will keep him from retrograde steps . His admirers have repeatedly asserted that the conservative leanings which he has at times manifested in the last year and a half were not so much symptoms of a lingering attachment to his old heresies as devices to prevent his royal master from growing impatient under the progressive character of his policy . However this may be , his late practical abandonment , in the Bancroft treaty , of the doctrine of the indissoluble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still more recent declaration in favor of administrative decentralization , and the substitution of local self-government in place of the old bureaucratic system , show very plainly that he does not mean to engage in a fruitless and disastrous struggle with the spirit of the age . How far he has carried his king with him appears from the remarkable passage in the late address from the throne to the Prussian Landtag , in which the monarch speaks with hearty sympathy of the Spanish revolution . The contemplation of Count Bismarck 's public career , either as a whole or in detail , is not edifying . From its opening to its turning-point in 1866 , it absolutely failed to command respect or inspire sympathy . His ends were too often ignoble , and his means almost always reprehensible . He showed cunning rather than wisdom , and audacity rather than true courage . His policy resembled more the wiles of the old school of diplomacy than the straight-forward , dignified statesmanship which happily prevails more and more in the councils of nations . Had he died before 1866 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Metternich . Even now he is still far from being the progressive reformer which an ill-informed public sees in him . Yet , with all his failings , he has been of great service to his countrymen , who will ever remember him as the trenchant instrument of Providence which hewed a way to national unity , and made their // fatherland more respected abroad than it had been since the reign of Charles V. The tendency of the Old World is slowly , but steadily , towards democratic forms of government . Many years may yet elapse before the Continental nations will find themselves in full enjoyment of all the rights of men . But when the last vestige of rule by divine right shall be swept away , they will perhaps praise Count Bismarck as the prac - tical revolutionist , who , by laying violent hands upon the anointed of the Lord , expedited not a little the final collapse of monarchy .
