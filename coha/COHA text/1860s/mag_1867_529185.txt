txt HISTORY OF THE SEWING-MACHINE . IN Cornhill , Boston , thirty years ado , there was a shop for the manufacture and repair of nautical instruments and philosophical apparatus , kept by An Davis . Mr. Davis was a very ingenious mechanic , who had invented a successful dovetailing machine , much spoken of at the time , when inventions were not as numerous as they are now . Being thus a noted man in his calling , he gave way to the foible of affecting an oddity of dress and deportment . It pleased him to say extravagant and nonsensical thngs , and to go about singing , and to attract attention by unusual garments . Nevertheless , being a really skilful mechanic , he was frequently consulted by the inventors and improvers of machinery , to whom he sometimes gave a valuable suggestion . In the year 1839 , two men in Boston - one a mechanic , and the other a capitalist - were striving to produce a knitting-machine , which proved to be a task beyond their strength . When the inventor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine to the shop of An Davis , to see if that eccentric genius could suggest the solution of the difficulty , and make the machine work . The shop , resolving itself into a committee of the whole , gathered about the knitting-machine and its proprietor , and were listening to an explanation of its principle , when Davis , in his wild , extravagant way , broke in with these words " What are you bothering yourselves with a knitting-machine for ? Why do n't you make a sewing-ma-chine ? " " I wish I could , " said the capitalist ; " but it ca n't be done . " " 0 , yes , it can , " said Davis ; " I can make a sewing-machine myself . " " Well , " said the other , " you do it , Davis , and I 11 insure you an independent fortune . " There the conversation dropped , and it was never resumed . The boastful remark of the master of the shop was considered merely one of his sallies of affected extravagance , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it was uttered without a thought of producing an effect . Nor did it produce any effect upon the person to whom it was addressed . Davis never attempted to construct a sewing-machine . Among the workmen who stood by and listened to this conversation was a young man from the country , a new hand , named Elias Howe , then twenty years old . The person whom we have named the capitalist , a well-dressed and fine-looking man , somewhat consequential in his manners , was an imposing figure in the eyes of this youth , new to city ways ; and he was much impressed with the emphatic assurance that a fortune was in store for the man who should invent a sewing-machine . He // was the more struck with it , because he had already amused himself with inventing some slight improvements , and recently he had caught from Davis the habit of meditating new devices . The spirit of invention , as all mechanics know , is exceedingly contagious . One man in a shop who invents something that proves successful will give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be tinkering over a device after their day 's work is done . There were other reasons , also , why a conversation so trifling and accidental should have strongly impressed itself upon the mind of this particular youth . Before that day , the idea of sewing by the aid of a machine had never occurred to him . ELIAS HOWE , the inventor of the sewing-machine , was born in 1819 , at Spencer , in Massachusetts , where his father was a farmer and miller . There was a grist-mill , a saw-mill , and a shingle-machine on the place ; but all of them together , with the aid of the farm , yielded but a slender revenue for a man blessed with eight children . It was a custom in that neighborhood , as in New England generally , forty years ago , for families to carry on some kind of manufacture at which children could assist . At six years of age , Elias Howe worked with his brothers and sisters at sticking the wire teeth into strips of leather for " cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he wa* old enough , he assisted upon the farm and in the mills , attending the district school in the winter months . I-fe is now of opinion , that it was the rude and simple mills belonging to his father which gave his mind its bent toward machinery ; but he can not remember that this bent was very decided , nor that he watched the operation of the mills with much attention to the mechanical principles involved . He was a careless , play-loving boy , and the first eleven years of his life passed without an event worth recording . At eleven he went to " live out " with a farmer of the neighborhood , intending to remain until he was twentyone . A kind of inherited lameness ren dered the hard work of a farmer 's boy distressing to him , and , after trying it for a year , he returned to his father 's house , and resumed his place in the mills , where he continued until he was sixteen . One of his young friends , returning from Lowell about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that famous town , that he was on fire to go thither . In * with his parents ' reluctant consent , he went to Lowell , and obtained a learner 's place in a large manufactory of cotton machinery , where he remained until the crash of 1837 closed the mills of Lowell , and sent him adrift , a seeker after work . He went to Cambridge , under the shadow of venerable Harvard . He found employment there in a large machine-shop , and was set at work upon the new hemp-carding machinery invented by Professor Treadwell . His cousin , Nathaniel P. Banks , since Speaker of the House of Representatives and Major-General , worked in the same shop and boarded in the same house with him . After working a few months at Cambridge , Elias Howe found employment more congenial in Boston , at the shop of An Davis , where the conversation occurred which we have just related . Judging merely by appearances , no one would have pitched upon him as the person likely to make one of the revolutionizing inventions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his joke , he was at twenty more a boy than a man . Nor was he very proficient in his trade , nor inclined to put forth extra exertion . Steady labor was always irksome to him , and frequently , owing to the constitutional weakness to which we have alluded , it was painful . He was not the person to seize an idea with avidity , anrl work it out with the passionate devotion of a Watt or a Goodyear . The only immediate effect upon him of the conversation in the shop of Mr. Davis was to induce a habit of reflecting upon the art of sewing , watching the process as performed by hand , and wondering whether it was within the // compass of the mechanic arts to do it by machinery . His uppermost thought , in those years , was , What a waste of power to employ the ponderous human arm , and all the intricate machinery of the fingers , in performing an operation so simple , and for which a robin 's strength would suffice ! Why not draw twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while visiting a shop where army and navy c1othin* was made , lie would look at the heaps of unsewed garments , all cut alike , all requiring the same stitch , the same number of stitches , and the same kind of seam , and say to himself , " What a pity this can not he done by machinery ! It is the very work for a machine to do . " Such thoughts , how ever , only flitted through his mind now and then : he was still far from any seiious attempt to construct a machine for sewing up the blue trousers . At twenty-one , being still a journeyman niachinist , earning nine dollars a week , lie married ; and , in time , cliildren came with inconvenient frequency . Nine dollars is a fixed quantity , or , rather , it was/lien ; and the addition of three little mouths to be fed from it , and three little backs to be clothed by it , coiiverted the vivacious father into a thoughtful and plodding citizen . His day 's labor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so fatiguing to him , that , on reaching his home , he would sometimes be too exhausted to eat , and he would go to bed , longing , as we have heard him say , " to lie in be d for ever and ever . " It was the pressure of poverty and this extreme fatigue that caused him , about the year 1843 , to set about the work of inventing the machine which , lie had heard four years before , would be " an independent fortune " to the inventor . Then it was that he caught the inventor 's mania , which gives its victims no re*t and no peace till they have accomplished the work to which they have abandoned themselves . He wasted many months on a false scent . When he began to experiment , his only thought was to invent a ma chine which should do what he saw his wife doing when she sewed . He took it for granted that sewing must be that , and his first device was a needle pointed at both ends , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down through the cloth , and carry the thread through it at each thrust . Hundreds of hours , by night and day , he brooded over this conception , and cut many a basket of chips in the endeavor to make something that would work such a needle so as to form the common stitch . He could not do it . One day , in 1844 , the thought flashed upon him , Is it necessary that a machine should imitate the performance of the hand ? May there not be another stitch ? This was the crisis of the invention . The idea of using two threads , and forming a stitch by the aid of a shuttle and a curved needle with the eye near the point , soon occurred to him , and he felt that he had invented a sewing-machine . It was in the month of October , 1844 , that he was able to convince himself by a rough model of wood and wire , that such a machine as he had projected would sew . At this time he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renioved to Cambridge to establish a machine for cutting palm-leaf into sti*ips for hats , - a machine invented by a brother of the elder Howe . Father and son were living in the same house , into the garret of which the son had put a lathe and a few machinist 's tools , and was doing a little work on his own account . 1-us ardor in the work of invention robbed him , however , of many hours that might have been employed , his friends thought , to better advantage by the father of a family . He was extremely poor , and his father had lost his palm-leaf machine by a fire . With an invention in his head that has since given him more than two hundred thousand dollars in a single y* : : - . and which is now yielding a profit more than one firm of a thousand dohia 's a day , lie could scarcely provide for his little family the necessaries of life . Nor could his invention // be tested , except by making a machine of steel and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the present time , with a machine before him for a model , a good mechanic could not , with his ordinary tools , construct a sewing-machine in less than two months , nor at a less expense than three hundred dollars . Elias Howe had only his model in his head , and he had not money enough to pay for the raw material requisite for one machine . There was living then at Cambridge a young friend and schoolmate of the inventor , named George Fisher , a coal and wood merchant , who had recently inherited some property , and was not disinclined to speculate with some of it . The two friends had been in the habit of conversing together upon the project of the sewing-machine . When the inventor had reached his final conception , in the fall of 1844 , he succeeded in convincing George Fisher of its feasibility , which led to a partnership between them for brin5 , ing the invention into use . The terms of this partnership were these : George Fisher was to receive into his house Elms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the machine , give up his garret for a workshop , and provide money for material and tools to the extent of five hundred dollars ; in return for which he was to become the proprietor of one half the patent , if the machine proved to be worth patenting . Early in December , 1844 , Elias Howe moved into the house of George Fisher , set up his shop in the garret , gathered materials about him , and went to work . It was a very small , low garret , but it sufficed for one zealous , brooding workman , who did not wish for gossiping visitors . It is strange how the great things come about in this world . This George Fisher , by whose timely aid such an inestimable boon was conferred upon wornankind , was led into the enterprise as much by good nature as by expectation of profit , and it was his easy acquisition of his money that made it easy for him to risk it So far as we know , neither of the partners indulged in any dream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver himself from that painful daily toil , and Fisher was inclined to aid an old friend , and not disinclined to own a share in a valuable patent . The greatest doers of good have usually proceeded in the same homely spirit . Thus Shakespeare wrote , thus Columbus sailed , thus Watt invented , thus Newton discovered . It seems , too , that George Fisher was Elias Howe 's only convert . " I believe , " testified Fisher in one of the great sewinb - machine suits , " I was the only one of his neighbors and friends in Cambridge that had any confidence in the success of the invention . He was generally looked upon as very visionary in undertaking anything of the kind , and I was thought very foolish in assisting him . " I tisthe old story . All the winter of 1844 - 45 Mr. Howe worked at his machine . His conception of what be intended to produce was so clear and complete , that he was little delayed by failures , but worked on with almost as much certainty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In April he sewed a seam by his machine . By the middle of May , 1845 , he bad completed his work . In July , he sewed by his machine all the seams of two suits of woollen clothes , one suit for Mr. Fisher and the other for himself , the sewing of both of which outlasted the cloth . This first of all sewing-machines , after crossing the ocean many times , and figuring as a dumb but irrefutable witness in many a court , may still be seen at Mr. Howe 's office in Broadway , where , within these few weeks , it has sewed seams in cloth at the rate of three hundred stitches a minute . It is agreed by all disinterested persons ( Professor Renwick among others ) who have examined this machine , that Elias Howe , in making it , carried the invention of the sewing-machine farther on towards its complete and final utility , than any other inventor has ever brought a firstrate invention at the first trial . It is a 530 // little thing , that first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of about a cubic foot and a half . Every contrivance in it has been since improved , and new devices have been added ; but no successful sewing-machine has ever been made , of all the seven hundred thousand now in existence , which does not contain some of the essential devices of this first attempt . We make this assertion without hesitation or reserve , because it is , we believe , the one point upon which all the great makers are agreed . Judicial decisions have repeatedly affirmed it . Like all the other great inventors , Mr. Howe found that , when he had completed his machine , his difficulties had but begun . After he had brought the machine to the point of making a few stitches , he went to Boston one day to get a tailor to come to Cambridge and arrange some cloth for sewing , and give his opinion as to the quality of the work done by the machine . The comrades of the man to whom he first applied dissuaded him from going , alleging that a sewing-machine , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tailors to beggary ; and this proved to be the unchangeable conviction of the tailors for the next ten years . It is probable that the machines first made would have been destroyed by violence , but for another fixed opinion of the tailors , which was , that no machine could be made that would really answer the purpose . It seems strange now , that the tailors of Boston could have persisted so long in such an opinion ; for Mr. Howe , a few weeks after he had finished his first model , gave them an opportunity to see what it could do . He placed his little engine in one of the rooms of the Quincy Hall Clothing Manufactory , and , seating himself before it , offered to sew up any seam that might be brought to him . One unbelieving tailor after another brought a garment , and saw its long seams sewed perfectly , at the rate of two hundred and fifty stitches a minute ; which was about seven times as fast as the work could be done by hand . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seams for all who chose to bring them to him . He amused himself , at intervals , in executing rows of ornamental stitching , and he showed the strength of . the machine by sewing the thick plaited skirts of frock-coats to the bodies . At last , he challenged five of the swiftest seamstresses in the establishment to sew a race with the machine . Ten seams of equal length were prepared for sewing , five of which were laid by the machine , and the other five given to the girls . The gentleman who held the watch , and who was to decide the wager , testified , upon oath , that the five girls were the fastest sewers that could be found , and that they sewed " as fast as they could , - much faster than they were in the habit of sewing , " - faster than they could have kept on for one hour . Nevertheless , Mr. Howe finished his five seams a little sooner than the girls finished their five ; and the umpire , who was himself a tailor , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the neatest and strongest . " Upon reading testimony like this , we wonder that manufacturers did not instantly set Mr. Howe at work making sewing-machines . No* me was ordered . Not a tailor enc. raged him by word or deed . Some objected that the machine did not make the whole garment . Others dreaded to encounter the fierce opposition of the journeymen . Others really thought it would beggar all hand sewers , and refrained from using it on principle . Otheis admitted the utility of the machine and the excellence of the work done by it ; but , said they , " We are doing well as we are , and fear to make such a change . " The great cost of the machine was a most serious obstacle to its introduction . A year or two since , Mr. Howe caused a copy of his first machine to be made for exhibition in his window , and it cost him two hundred and fifty dollars . In 1845 he could not have furnished his machine for less than three hundred dollars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty of them . // The inventor was not disheartened by the result of the introduction of the Iri*chine . The next thing was to get the invention patented , and Mr. Howe again shut himself up in George Fisher 's garret for three or four months , and made another machine for deposit in the Patent-Office . In the spring of 1846 , there being no prospect of reveflue from the invention , he engaged as " enoineer " upon one of the railroads terminating at Boston , and Arove " a locomotive daily for some weeks ; but the labor proved too much for his strength , and he was compelled to give it up . Late in the summer , the model and the documents being ready for the Patent-Office , the two associates treated themselves to a journey to Washington , where the wonderful machine was exhibited at a fair , with no results except to amuse the crowd . September io , 1846 , the patent was issued , and soon after the young men returned to Cam-bridbe* George Fisher was now totally discouraged . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had provided the money for the tools and material for two machines ; he had I ) aid the expense of getting the patent , and of the journey to Washington ; he had advanced in all about two thousand dollars ; and he saw not the remotest probability of the invention becoming J ) rofitable . Elias Howe moved back to his father 's house , and George Fisher considered his advances in the light of a dead loss . " I had lost confidence , " he has since testified , " in the machine 's ever paying anythin6 . " But mothers and inventors do not give up their offsprinb so . America having rejected the invention , Mr. Howe resolved to offer it to England . In October , 1846 , his brother , Amasa B. howe , with the assistance of their father , took passage in the steerabe of a sailing packet , and conveyed one ' of the machines to London . An Englishman was the first manufacturer who had faith enough in the American sewingmachine to invest money in it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XVilliam Thomas , who emI ) loyed , according to his own account , five thousand persons in the manufacture of corsets , umbrellas , valises , carpet-bags , apd shoes . William Thomas examined anti approved the machine . Necessity , as Poor Richard remarks , can not make a good bargain ; but the bar*ain which it made on this occasion , through the agency of Amas . B. H*we , was signally bad . He sold to Mr. Thomas , for two hundred and fifty pounds sterling , the machine he had brought with him , and the right to usc as many others in his own business as he desired . There was also a verbal understanding that Mr. Thomas was to patent the invention in England , and , if the machine came into use there , he was to pay the inventor three pounds on every machine sold . That was an excellent day 's work for William Thomas of Cheapside . The verbal part of thc bargain has never been carried out . He patented the invention ; and ever since the machines began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or imported into England , have paid tribute to him at the rate of ten pounds or less for each machine . Elias Howe is of opinion that the investment of that two hundred and fifty pounds has yielded a profit of one million dollars . Mr. Thomas further proposed to engage the inventor to adapt the machine to the work upon corsets , offering him the munificent stipend of . three pounds a week , and to defray the expense of workshop , tools , and material . Amasa B. Howe returned to Cambridge with this offer . America being still insensible to the charms of the new invention , and the two hundred and fifty pounds having been immediately absorbed by the long-accumulating necessities of the family , and there being no prospect of advantageous employment at home , Elias Ho*ve accepted the offer , and both brothers set sail for London , February 5 , 1347 . They went in the steerage , and cooked their own provisions . William Thomas provided a shop and its requisites , and even advanced money for the passage to Eng // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon , - wife and three children . After eight months of labor , the inventor succeeded in adapting his machine to the purposes of the stay-maker ; and when this was done , the stay-maker apparently desired to get rid of the inventor . He required him to do the miscellaneous repairs , and took the tone with him which the ignorant purse-holder , in all lands , is accustomed to hold in his dealings with those to whom he pays wages . The Yankee , of course , resented this behavior , and XVilliam Thomas discharged Elias Howe from his employment . To he a poor stranger with a sick wife and three children in America , is to be in a purgatory that is provided with a practicable door into paradise . To he such a person in London , is to he in a hell without visible outlet . Since undertaking to write this little history of the sewing-machine , we have gone over about thirty thousand pages of printed testimony taken in the numerous , suits to which sewing-machine patents have given rise . Of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can gather the history of Elias Howe during the next few months . From a chance acquaintance , named Charles Inglis , a coach-maker , who proved to he a true friend , he hired a small room for a *vork-shop , in which , after borrowing a few tools , he began to construct his fourth sewing-machine . Long before it was finished , he saw that he must reduce his expenses or leave his machine unfinished . From three rooms he removed his family to one , and that a small one , in the cheapest quarter of Surrey . Nor did that economy suffice ; and he resolved to send his family home while he could , and trust to the machine in hand for the means to follow them . " Before his wife left London , " testifies Mr. Inglis , " he had frequently borrowed money from me in sums of five pounds , and requested me to get him credit for provisions . On the evening of Mrs. Ho we 's departure , the night was very wet and stormy , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk to the ship . He had no money to pay the cab-hire , and he borrowed a few shillings from me to pay it , which he repaid by pledging some of his clothing . Some linen came home from his washerwoman for his wife and children on the day of her departure . She could not take it with her on account of not having money to pay the woman . " After the departure of his family , the solitary inventor was still more severely pinched . " He has borrowed a shilling from me , " says Mr. Inglis , " for the purpose of buying beans , which I saw him cook and eat in his own room . " After three or four months of labor , the machine was finished . It was worth fifty pounds . The only customer he could find for it was a workingman of his acquaintance , who offered five pounds for it , if he could have time to pay it in . The inventor was obliged to accept this offer . The purchaser gave his note for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to another mechanic for four pounds . To pay his debts and his expenses home , Mr. Howe pawned his precious first machine and his letters-patent . " He drew a hand-cart , with his baggage on it , to the ship , to save the expense of cartage " ; and again he took passage in the steerage , along with his English friend , Charles Inglis . His brother Amasa had long before returned to America . In April , 1849 , Elms Howe landed in New York , after an absence of two years from the country , with half a crown in his pocket . Four years had nearly elapsed since the completion of his first machine , and this small piece of silver was the net result of his labors upon that invention . He and his friend went to one of the cheapest emigrant hoarding - houses , and Elias Howe sought employment in the machineshops , which , luckily , he found without delay . The news reached him soon that his wife was dying of consumption , hut he had not the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , he received ten dollars from his Hisioty of 1/ic Scwi ; zg-Mackinc. // father , and he was thus enabled to reach his wife 's bedside , and receive her last breath . He had no clothes except those he daily wore , and he was obliged to borrow a suit from his brother-in-law in which to appear at the funeral . It was remarked by his old friends , that his natural gayety of disposition was quite quenched by the severity of his recent trials . He was extremely downcast and worn . He looked like a man just out after a long and agonizing sickness . Soon came intelligence that the ship in which he had embarked all his household goods had been wrecked off Cape Cod , and was a total loss . But now he was amonb friends , who hastened to relieve his immediate necessities , and who took care of his children . He was soon at work ; not , indeed , at his beloved machine , but at work which his friends considered much more rational . He was again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bestows two eminent gifts upon the same individual , the man who makes a great invention is seldom the man who prevails upon the public to use it . Every Watt needs his Boulton . Neither George Fisher nor Elias Howe possessed the executive force requisite for so difficult a piece of work as the introduction of a machine which then cost two or three hundred dollars to make , and upon which a purchaser bad to take lessons as upon the piano , and which the whole body of tailors regarded with dread , aversion , or contempt . It was reserved , therefore , for other men to educate the people into availing themselves of this exquisite labor-saving-apparatus . Upon his return home , after his residence in London , Elias Howe discovered , much to his surprise , that the sewing-machine had become celebrated , though its inventor appeared forgotten . Several ingenious mechanics , who had only heard or read of a machine for sewing , and others who had seen the Howe machine , had turned their attention to inventing in the same direction , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before us three handbills , which show that in 1849 a sewingmachine was carried about in Western New York , and exhibited as a curiosity , at a charge of twelve and a half cents for admission . At Ithaca the following bill was posted about in May , 1849 , a few weeks after the inventor 's return from Europe - A GREAT CURIOSITY ! ! The YANKEE SEWING-MACHINE is now EXHIBITING AT THIS PLACE FROM 8 A. M. to 5 P.M. The public were informed by other bills , that this wonderful machine could make a pair of pantaloons in forty minutes , and do the work of six hands . The people of Ithaca , it appears , attended the exhibition in great numbers , and many ladies carried home specimens of the sewing , which they preserved as curiosities . But this was not all . Some machinists and others in Boston and elsewhere were making sewing-machines in a rude , imperfect manner , several of which had been sold to manufacturers , and were in daily operation . The inventor , upon inspecting these crude products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first combined and patented . Poor as he was , he was not disposed to submit to this infringement , and he began forthwith to prepare for war against the infringers . When he entered upon this litigation , he was a journeyman machinist ; his machine and his letters-patent were in pawn three thousand miles away , and the patience , if not the purses , of his friends was exhausted . When the contest ended , a leading branch of the national industry was tributary to him . The first step was to get back from England that first machine , and the document issued from the PatentOffice. // In the course of the summer of 1849 he contrived to raise the hundred dollars requisite for their deliverance ; and the Hon. Anson Burlingame , who was going to London , kindly undertook to hunt them up in the wilderness of Surrey . He found them , and sent them horn.e in the autumn of the same year . The inventor wrote polite letters to the infringers , warning them to desist , and offering to sell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appears , were disposed to acknowledge his rights and to accept his proposal . That one induced the others to resist , and nothing remained hut a resort to the courts . Assisted by his father , the inventor began a suit ; but he was soon made aware that justice is a commodity much beyond the means of a journeyman mechanic . He tried to reawaken the faith of George Fisher , and induce him to furnish the sinews of war ; but George Fisher had had enough of the sewing-machine : he would sell his half of the patent for what it had cost him ; but he would advance no more money . Mr. Howe then looked about for some one who would buy George Fisher 's share . He found three men who agreed to do this , - and tried to do it , but could not raise the money . The person to whom he was finally indebted for the means of securing his rights was George W. Bliss of Massachusetts , who was prevailed upon to buy Mr. Fisher 's share of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the suits . He did this only as a speculation . He thought there might be something in this new notion of sewing by machinery , and , if there was , the machine must become universal , and yield large revenues . This might be ; he even thought it probable still , so weak was his faith , that he consented to embark in the enterprise only on condition of his being secured against loss by a mortgage on the farm of the inventor 's father . This generous parent - who is still living in Cambridge - came once more to the rescue , and thus secured his son 's fortune . The suits went on ; but , as they went 535 on at the usual pace of patent cases , the inventor had abundant leisure to push his invention out of doors . Towards the close of 1850 we find him in New York , superintending the construction of fourteen sewing-machines at a shop in Gold Street , adjoining which he had a small office , furnished with a five-dollar desk and two fifty-cent chairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Castle Garden in October , 1851 , where , for the space of two weeks , it sewed gaiters , pantaloons , and other work . Several of them were sold to a bootmaker in Worcester , who used them for sewing boot-legs with perfect success . Two or three others were daily operated in Broadway , to the satisfaction of the purchasers . We can say , therefore , of Elias Howe , that besides inventing the sewing-machine , and besides making the first machine with his own hands , he brought his invention to the point of its successful employment in manufacture . While he was thus engaged , evei*ts occurred which seriously threatened to rob him of all the benefit of his invention . The infringers of his patent were not men of large means nor of extraordinary energy , and they had no " case " whatever . There was the machine which Elias Howe had made in 1845 , there were his letters-patent , and all the sewing-machines then known to be in existence were essentially the same as his . But in August , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was of very different mettle from those steady-going Yankees , and capable of carrying on a much more vigorous warfare than they . This was that Isaac Merritt Singer who has since so often astonished the Fifth Avenue , and is now amusing Paris , by the oddity and splendor of his equipa*es . He was then a poor and baffled adventurer . He had been an actor and manager of a theatre , and had tried his hand at various enterprises , none of which had been very , successful . In 1850 , he invented ( as he has since sworn ) a carving-machine , and , having obtained an History of the Sewi ; zgjlachinc. // order for one from Boston , he made it , and took it himself to Boston . In the shop in which he placed his carvingmachine he saw , for the first time , several sewing-machines , brought there for repairs . Orson C. Phelps , the proprietor of the shop ( Mr. Sin* er says ) , showed him one of these machines , and said to him that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of doing a greater variety of work , " it would be a good thing ' ; and if Mr. Singer could accomplish this , he could get more money from sewing than from carving machines . Whereupon Mr. Singer contemplated the apparatus , and at night meditated upon it , with so much success , that he was able in the morning to exhibit a drawing of an improved machine . This sketch ( so he swears ) contained three original devices , which to this day form part of the sewing-machine made by the Singer Company . The sketch being approved , the next thing was to construct a model . Mr. Singer having no money , the purchaser of his carving-machine agreed to advance fifty dollars for the purpose ; upon which Mr . Singer flew at the work like a ti6 " I worked , ' he says , " day and night , sleeping but three or four hours out of the twenty-four , and eating generally but once a day , as I knew I must get a machine made for forty dollars , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night of the eleventh day from the day it was commenced . About nine o'clock that evening we got the parts of the machine together , and commenced trying it . The first attempt to sew was unsuccessful , and the workmen , who were tired out with almost unremitting work , left me one by one , intimating that it was a failure . I continued trying the machine , with Zieber " ( who fumished the forty dollars ) " to hold the lamp for me , but , in the nervous condition to which I had been reduced by incessant work and anxiety , was unsuccessful in getting the machine to sew tight stitches . About midnight I started with Zieber to the hotel where I boarded . Upon the way we sat down on a pile of boards , and Zieber asked me if I had noticed that the loose loops of thread on the upper side of the cloth came from the needle . It then flashed upon me that I had forgotten to adjust the tension upon the needle thread . Zieber and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tried the machine , and sewed five stitches perfectly , when the thread broke . The perfection of those stitches satisfied me that the machine was a success , and I stopped work , went to the hotel , and had a sound sleep . By three o'clock the next day I had the machine finished , antl started with it to New York , where I employed Mr. Charles M. Keller to get out a patent for it . " Such was the introduction to the sewing-machine of the man whose energy and audacity forced the machine upon an unbelieving public . He borrowed a little money , and , forming a partnership with his Boston patron and the machinist in whose shop he had made his model , began the manufacture of the machines . Great and numerous were the difficulties which arose in his path , but one by one he overcame them all . He advertised , he travelled , he sent out agents , he procured the insertion of articles in the newspapers , he exhibited the machine at fairs in town and country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in the nick of time something always happened to save him , and year after year he advanced toward an assured success . We well remember his early efforts , when he had only the back part of a small store in Broadway , and a little shop over a railroad depot ; and we remember also the general incredulity with regard to the value of the machine with which his name was identified . Even after hearing him explain it at great length , we iv ere very far from expecting to see him , one day , riding to the Central Park in a French dillgeilce , drawn by five horses , paid for by the sewing-machine . Still less did we anticipate that , within twelve years , the Singer Company would be selling a thousand sewing-machines a iveek , 536 May , . // at a profit of a thousand dollars a day . He was the true pioneer of the mere business of selling the machines , and made it easier for all his subsequent competitors . Mr. Singer had not been long in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was infringing his patent of 1846 . The adventurer threw all his energy and his growing means into the contest against the original inventor . The great object of the infringing interest was to discover an earlier inventor than Elias 1-lowe . For this 1 ) urpose , the patent records of England , France , and the United States were most diligently searched ; encyclop*dias were examined , and an attempt was even made to show that the Chinese had possessed a sewing-machine for ages . Nothing , however , was discovered that would have made a plausible defence , until Mr. Singer joined the infringers . He ascertained that a New York mechanic , named XValter Hunt , who had a small machine-shop up a narrow alley in Abingdon Square , had made , or tried to make , a sewing-machine as early as 1832 . Walter Hunt was found . He had attempted to invent a sewing-machine in 1832 ; and , what was more important , he had hit upon the shuttle as the means of forming the stitch . He said , too , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very imperfectly , and , after wearying himself with fruitless experiments , he had thrown it aside . Parts of this machine , after a great deal of trouble , were actually found among a quantity of rubbish in the garret of a house in Gold Street . Here was a discovery ! Could Mr. Hunt take these parts , all rusty and broken , into his shop , and complete the machine as originally made , so that it would sew ? He thought he could . Urged on by the indefatigable Singer , supplied by him with money , and stimulated by the prospect of fortune , Walter Hunt tried hard and long to put his machine together ; and when he found that he could not , he employed an ingenious inventor to aid him in the work . But their united ingenuity was unequal to 537 the performance of an impossibility : the machine could not be got to sew a seam . The fragments found in the garret did , indeed , demonstrate that in 1832 Walter Hunt had been upon the track of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the chase in despair , long before coming up with the game . And this the courts have uniformly held . In the year 1854 , after a long trial , Judge Sprague , of Massachusetts , decided that " the plaintiff 's patent is valid , and the defendant 's machine is an infringement . " The plaintiff was Elms Howe ; the real infringer , I. M. Singer . judge Sprague further observed , that " there is no evidence in this case , that leaves a shadow of doubt that , for all the benefit conferred upon the public by the introduction of a sewing-machine , the public are indebted to IVIr . Howe . " This decision was made when nine years had elapsed since the completion of the first machine , and when eight years of the term of the first patent had expired . The patent , however , even then , was so little productive , that the inventor , embarrassed as he was , was able upon the death of his partner , Mr. Bliss , to buy his share of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole proprietor of his l ) atent ; and this occurred just when it was about to yield a princely revenue . From a few hundreds a year , his income rapidly incre* sed , until it went beyond two hundred thousand dollars . He has received in all , up to the present time , about seventeen hundred thousand dollars . By the time the extension of the patent expires , September Jo , 1867 , the amount will not fall far short of the round two millions . As Mr. Howe has devoted twenty-seven years of his life to the invention and development of the sewing-machine , the public have compensated him at the rate of seventy-five thousand dollars a year . It has cost him , however , immense sums to defend his rights , and he is now very far from being the richest of the sewing-machine kings . He has the inconvenient reputation of being worth four millions , which is exactLfzs/o ; y of //*c *c'z*'z ; ig-iJiZ*c1zz ; zc. // ly ten times the value of his present estate . So much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sewingmachine , we know not how to he cautious enough ; for scarcely anything can he said on that branch of the subject which some one has not an interest to deny . We the other day looked over the testimony taken in one of the suits which Messrs . Grover and Baker have had to sustain in defence of their wellknown " stitch . " The testimony in that single case fills two immense volumes , containing three thousand five hundred and seventy-five pages . At the XVheeler and Wilson establishment in Broadway , there is a library of similar volumes , resembling in appearance a quantity of London and Paris Directories . The Singer Company are equally blessed with sewing-machine literature , and Mr. Howe has chests full of it . We learn from these volumes , that there is no useful device connected with the apparatus , the invention of which is not claimed by more than one person . And no wonder . If to-day the ingenious reader could invent the slightest real improvement to the sewing-machine , so real that a machine having it would possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he should sell the right to use that improvement at so low a rate as fifty cents for each machine , he would find himself in the enjoyment of an income of one hundred thousand dollars per annum . The consequence is , that the number of patents already issued in the United States for sewing-machines , and improvements in sewing-machines , is about nine hundred ! Perhaps thirty of these patents are valuable , but the great improvements are not more than ten in number , and most of those were made in the infancy of the machine . By general consent of the able men who are now conducting the sewin5-machine business ( including Elias Howe ) , the highest place in the list of improvers is assigned to ALLEN B. WILSON . This most ingenious gentleman completed a practical sewingmachine early in 1849 , without ever having seen one , and without having any knowledge of the devices of Elias Howe , who was then buried alive in London . Mr. Wilson , at the time , was a very young journeyman cabinet-maker , living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which inventors usually experience , he procured a patent for his machine , improved it , and formed a connection with a young carriage-maker of his acquaintance , Nathaniel Wheeler , who had some capital ; and thus was founded the great and famous house of Wheeler and Wilson , who are now making sewing-machines at the rate of about fifty-three thousand a year . These gentlemen were honest enough in opposing the claim of Elias Howe , since Mr. Wilson knew himself to he an original inventor , and he employed devices not to be found in Mr. Howe 's machine . Instead of a shuttle , he used a " rotating hook , "  --  a device as ingenious as any in mechanism . The " fourmotion feed , " too , was another of Mr. Wilson 's masterly inventions , sufficient of itself to stamp him an inventor of genius . Nothing , therefore , was more natural than that Messrs . Wheeler and Wilson should regard Mr. Howe 's charge of infringement with astonishment and indignation , and join in the contest against him . Messrs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 0 . Grover was a Boston tailor , whose attention was directed to the sewing-machine soon after Mr. Howe 's return from Europe . It was he who , after numberless trials , invented the exquisite devices by which the famous " Grover and Baker stitch " is formed , - a stitch which for some purposes is of unequalled utility . When , by the decision of the courts , all the makers had become tributary to Elias Howe , paying him a certain sum for each machine made , then a most violent warfare broke out among the leading houses , - Singer and Company , Wheeler and Wilson , Grover and Baker , - each accusing the others of infringement . At Albany , in 1856 , these // causes were to be tried , and parties concerned saw before them a good three months ' work in court . By a lucky chance , one member of this happy family had not entirely lost his temper , and was still in some degree capable of using his intellect . It occurred to this wise head , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were then assembled at Albany the men who , among them , held patents which controlled the whole business of making sewing-machines ; and that it would be infinitely better for them to combine and control , than to contend with and devour one another . They all came into this opinion ; and thus was formed the " Combination , " of which such terrible things are uttered by the surreptitious makers of sewing-machines . Elias Howe , who is the best-tempered man in the world , and only too easy in matters pecuniary , had the complaisance to join this confederation , only insisting that at least twenty-four licenses should be issued by it , so as to prevent the manufacture from sinking into a monopoly . By the terms of this agreement , Mr. Howe was to receive five dollars upon every machine sold in the United States , and one dollar upon each one exported . The other parties agreed to sell licenses to use their various devices , or any of them , at the rate of fifteen dollars for each machine ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the parties . It was further agreed , that part of the license fees received should be reserved as a fund for the prosecution of infringers . This agreement remained unchanged until the renewal of Mr. Howe 's patent in iS6o , when his fee was reduced from five dollars to one dollar , and that of the Combination from fifteen dollars to seven . That is to say , every sewing-machine honestly made pays Elias Howe one dollar ; and every sewing-machine made , which includes any device or devices the patent for which is held by any other member of the Combination , pays seven dollars to the Combination . Of this seven dollars , Mr. Howe receives his one , and the other six goes into the fund for the defence of the patents against infringers . For example , take the Wilcox and Gibbs machine , the only one , as far as we know , which was not invented by a Yankee , or in Yankee land . Twelve years ago , Mr. James E. A. Gibbs , a Virginia farmer , saw in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man of a decided turn for mechanics , he examined the drawing with great attention ; but , as it exhibited only the upper part of the machine , he could form no idea of the contrivance underneath by which the stitch was formed . The working of the apparatus was , however , very plain , down to the moment when the needle perforates the cloth ; and he fell into the habit of musing upon the course of events after the point of the needle was lost to view . The result of his cogitations , aided by infinite whittling , was the ingenious little revolving hook which constitutes the peculiarity of the Wilcox and Gibbs machine . But that machine , besides employing Mr. Gibbs 's invention , uses the feeding apparatus of Allen B. Wilson , and the eye-pointed needle of Elias Howe . It is therefore tributary to the Combination , and pays it seven dollars for each machine . A similar history could be related of the " Florence , " the Weed , " the " Elliptic , " the " Empire , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are curious in mechanical devices . The " Florence , " for example , ( so called because it is made in Florence , Massachusetts , ) has a beautiful contrivance , by means of which the operator can sew backwards as well as forwards . The shuttle of this machine is so constructed as to make its own " tension " ; or , in other words , the shuttle holds the thread as tightly or as loosely as the seam requires . Without presuming to give an opinion with regard to the comparative utility of the various machines , we may say , that we were exceedingly struck with the elegance and ingenuity of the " Florence . " The business of making and selling // sewing-machines , which was not fairly started before 1856 , has attained a truly wonderful development . Twenty-seven firms or companies have been engaged in it at one time , a few of which have lately withdrawn , leaving about twenty still in the business . One of these has twenty-four stores of its own , in the large cities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents . Another boasts that there are thirty-nine cities on this planet where its machines can be bought at all times . We can ourselves bear witness , that , in such cities as Cincinnati , St. Louis , and Chicago , each of the well-known makers has a spacious and elegant establishment , with all the appurtenances to which we are accustomed in New York . In Australia , one of our New York companies , at least , has an establishment of its own . Gentlemen best acquainted with the business compute that the whole number of sewing-machines made in the United States up to the close of the year 1866 was about seven hundred and fifty thousand . During the quarter ending December io , x866 , the number of machines made by licensed companies , as reported by them to Elias Howe , was 52,219 ! This is above the rate of two hundred thousand per annum . Mr. Howe is of opinion that about half as many more are produced by unlicensed makers , including the Yankees who , driven from the United States by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the Canada line . If his conjecture is correct , we are now producing the astounding and almost incredible number of one thousand sewing-machines every working day , atan average cost to the purchaser of sixty dollars each . The world , however , is a very large place , and America still supplies it with most of its sewing machines . When we visit single establishments in New England which employ five hundred machines , when we learn that the shirt-makers of one city , Tray , are now running more than three thousand of them , and when we consider that there are in the United States May , six millions of families , most of whom mean to have a sewing-machine when they can afford it , we can believe that even so many as a thousand a day may be absorbed . About one fifth of all the machines made in the United States are exported to foreign countries . Wheeler and Wilson , Grover and Baker , Singer and Company , Wilcox and Gibbs , the Florence , and others , are familiar names in St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madrid , Melbourne , Mexico , Rio Janeiro , Havana , Valparaiso , Vancouver 's Island , and wherever else in the world many stitches are taken . Foreigners can no more make a Yankee sewinb-machine than they can make a Yankee clock . They have not the machinery-as curious as the machine itself-by which each part of the apparatus is made at the minimum of expense , and with perfect certainty of excellence . To found a sewing-machine manufactory in Europe which could compete with those of America would involve an expenditure of two millions of dollars , and the expatriation of several of our American foremen . It is only upon a great scale that the machines can be made well or profitably . By means of the various improvements and attachments , the sewingmachine now performs nearly all that the needle ever did . It seams , hems , tucks , binds , stitches , quilts , gathers , fells , braids , embroiders , and makes button-holes . It is used in the manufacture of every garment *vorn by man , woman , or child . Firemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trunks , harness , carriage curtains and linings , buffalo-robes , horseblankets , horse-collars , powder-flasks , mail-bags , sails , awnings , whips , saddles , corsets , hats , caps , valises , pocketbooks , trusses , suspenders , are among the articles made by its assistance ; but it is employed , quite as usefully , in making kid gloves , parasols , and the most delicate articles of ladies ' attire . Some of our readers , perhaps , witnessed the show , the other day in New York , of the shoes , gaiters , and ladies ' boots // 54 ' made for the Paris Exhibition . They were of all degrees of delicacy , from the stout Balmoral to the boot of kid , satin , or velvet ; and every kind of stitc-* Aad been employed in their manufacture . Some of the stitches were so fine that they could not be distinctly seen without a magnifying-glass , and some were as coarse and strono as those of men 's boots . The special wonder of this display was that every stitch in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machine . Mr. E. C. Burt , who made this splendid contribution to the Exhibition , assured us , and will assure the universe in general at Paris , that all this variety of elegant and durable work was performed on the " Howe Sewing- Machine . " Upon ordinary boots and shoes , the machine has long been employed ; but it is only recently that any one has attempted to apply it to the manufacture of those dainty things which ladies wear upon their feet when they go forth , armed car- *-Jie , for conquest . A similar change has occurred in other branches of manufacture . As operators have increased in skill , and as the special capabilities of the different machines have been better understood , finer kinds of work have been ( lone upon them than used to be thought possible . Some young ladies have developed a kind of genius for the sewing - machine . The apparatus has fascinated them ; they execute marvels upon it , as Gottschalk does upon the piano . One of the most recent applications of the machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Yankee in Connecticut has invented attachments by which the finest braids are sewn into bonnets of any form . Attempts have been made to estimate the value , in money , of the sewing-machine to the people of the United States . Professor Renwick , who has made the machine a particular study , expressed the opinion seven years ago , *n oath , that the saving in labor then amounted to nineteen millions of dollars per annum . Messrs . XVheeler and Wilson have published an estimate which indicates that the total value of the labor performed by the sewing-machine , in 1863 , was three hundred and forty-two millions of dollars . A good hand-sewer averages thirty-five stitches per minute ; the fastest machines on some kinds of work perform three thousand a minute . There are in a good shirt 20,620 stitches ; what a saving to do them at machine speed ! We glean from the volumes of testimony before us a few similar facts . The stitching of a man 's hat by hand requires fifteen minutes ; by machine , one minute . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' caps as ten men can do by hand . In fine clothing for men , the saving is , of course , not so great . Messrs . Brooks Brothers of New York say that the making of a first-rate overcoat by hand requires six days ' steady sewing ; by machine , three days . In the general work of a tailor , the machine saves a journeyman about four hours in twelve . Carriage - trimmers testify that one machine and three hands , are equivalent to eleven hands . In the truss and bandage business , which is one of very great extent and importance , one machine is equal to ten women . In the manufacture of bags for flour , salt , and meal , of which the city of New York produces two millions of dollars ' worth per annum , a machine does the work of nine girls . In mere hemming , on a machine fitted expressly for the purpose , one machine does the work of fifty girls . Yet where is the woman who can say that her sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was before the sewing-machine came in ? But this is not the machine 's fault ; it is the fault of human nature . As soon as lovely woman discovers that she can set ten stitches in the time that one used to require , a fury seizes her to put ten times as many stitches in every ( tarment as she formerly did . Tailors and seamstresses , not content with sewing the seams of garments , must needs cover them with figures executed by " stitching . " And thus it is that // 542 man never is , but always to be , blest . *if Mith one part of his brain he invenus a labor-saving apparatus , the o ' *h *r lobes immediately create as much ii ew ' abor as the apparatus saves . But *c is this chase of Desire after Ability which keeps the world moving , and tends always to equalize the lot of men . The sewing-machine is one of the means by which the industrious laborer is as well clad as any millionnaire need be , and by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decoration . Elias Howe can justly claim that it was his invention which enabled the United States to put and keep a million men in the field during the war . Those countless garments , tents , haversacks , cartridge-boxes , shoes , blankets , sails , - how could they have been produced without the sewing-machine ? One day during the war , at three o'clock in the afternoon , an order from the War Department reached New York by telegraph for fifty thousand sandbags , such as are used in field-works . By two o'clock the next afternoon , the bags had been made , packed , shipped , and started southward . Mr. Howe might well have excused himself from personal service in the field . He did not , however . Having raised and equipped a regiment in Connecticut , and presented every officer in it with a horse , he was elected its colonel ; but being the most unwarlike of men , and totally ignorant of military affairs , he had the good sense to decline this honor , and enlisted in the regiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his health failed . Nothing prevented his serving to the end , but the certainty that he could not support the exposure and fatigue . By way of amusing himself in camp near Baltimore , he volunteered to be the postmaster of his regiment , and rode to Baltimore and back every day with the mail . He was sitting in a car , one day , in Baltimore , when he overheard two individuals of a coppery cast of character discoursing upon the conduct of the war . " Yes , sir , " said one of these gentlemen , " the whole thing was got up for the purpose of giving fat contracts to the Abolitionists . There s old Howe , the sewing-machine man , worth his millions ; they have actually given Aim the contract for carrying the mail to the army . " " You do n't say so ! " said the other , aghast . To which his friend replied , " It a fact ; I saw Howe myself riding in one of the mail-carts yesterday . " Mr. Howe chuckled , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , did half the calumnies of the war originate , - those relating to General Butler , for example . In the early days of the sewing-machine , it was not supposed that it would ever come into general use in families . The great cost of the machine , and the supposed difficulty of learning to use it , were considered fatal obstacles to its general introduction into households . The price has now been reduced to fifty-five dollars for the cheapest good machines , and it has been found that an intelligent woman can learn to sew with it in an hour . An average seamstress becomes proficient in the use of it in a month . For some time past , therefore , the great object of the celebrated makers is to produce the best family machine . This is the point of rivalry among them . A lady who leaves her home , after a breakfast consultation with her husband , and goes forth to select a family sewlng-m achine , has undertaken an expedition which promises nothing but pleasure ; but it does not perform its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid . She pauses before a magnificent marble store , with windows formed of single panes of plate-glass ; in one of which are sewing-machines , brilliant with polished steel , silver plate , and rosewood , and in the other are beautiful garments covered with miraculous stitching , executed by those pretty parlor ornaments . Yielding to these // allurements , she enters a grand saloon , a hundred feet long , extending back to another street , and covered with Wilton carpet , of better quality , probably , than that which she treads in her own parlor . Perhaps the walls and ceilings are frescoed ; and , if they are not , they are richly papered and painted . Sewingmachines in long rows , not too close together for convenient moving about , agreeably dot the whole surface of the apartment , as far as the eye can penetrate the gloom of the distance . Along the wall , at the farther end of the room , she will discover , by and by , a row of enclosed desks , like those of a bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commodious as taste and money can make it . These are for the dignitaries of the Company , - the president , the treasurer , the cashier , the general agent , the advertising clerk . Here and there a young lady may be seen " operating " one of the machines in a graceful attitude , and with such perfect ease as to dispel the fears of a purchaser most distrustful of her powers . The rapid and yet not noisy click of the machines is cheering , and seems the appropriate music of the place . And this grand hall is only one of many apartments . The basement , and the cellar below the basement , each as large as the store , are occupied as depositories , repairing - shops , packingrooms ; while in the story above the store may be found superb rooms , wherein ladies who have bought a machine receive instruction in the art of using it , attending daily , if they choose , until they have become proficients in hemming , sewing , braiding , making button-holes , and in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait upon the lady soon learns her errand , and discovers her ignorance . Indeed , she frankly avows her ignorance . She has come out , she artlessly says , in pursuit of knowledge . She desires to ascertain which is the best sewingmachine in existence for family use . Long practice has taught an intelligent and ambitious young man how to deal 543 with cases of this kind . He does , in his inmost soul , believe that the sewing machines made by the company he serves are the very best in the world , especially for family use . But he feels the delicacy of his situation . " Of course , madam , we are interested parties , and it would be no more than natural that we should represent our machines to be the best in the market . But it is no part of the policy of our company to disparage those made by our neighbors . We are on friendly terms with them , and we are ready to admit that some of them do make machines which for some purposes are excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is our specialty , why then , madam , we can not hesitate . Upon that point there can be but one opinion . Nevertheless , we do not ask ladies to believe what we say ; we show them what our machine does , and let it speak for itself . " Conciliated by such modesty and candor , the lady watches with pleasure and admiration while one dexterous young lady runs up a seam , and another hems a sheet , and another does a little quilting , and another makes a button-hole in half a minute . The lady herself takes a seat at a machine , and is astonished to find herself sewing at a rattling pace , " without any previous instruction . " She is convinced . She is perfectly satisfied . She sympathizes with the tender compassion expressed by the clerk for the great number of ladies who have been deluded into buying other machines , which , after distracting a household for many months , are now discarded and consigned to the garret . " You see , madam , advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the long run , real merit overcomes all opposition . " She assents with her whole soul to this proposition . It accords with what she has observed of human life . She has even made the remark herself . The impulse is strong within her to buy one of these peerless machines on the spot , and she has not the slightest History of the Sewing-Mackliw. // doubt that she shall do so in the course of the day . But it was agreed between her husband and herself , that she should examine all before purchasinc , ; and so , in obedience to a stern sense of duty , she resolves to go through the form - the mere form - of looking at other machines . She feels that she must be able to say that she has fulfilled her compact . In another spacious and elegant saloon , another accomplished clerk claims for another machine precisely the same excellences , which other young ladies proceed to exhibit . If she ventures timidly ' to intimate that she has been looking at a machine elsewhere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discourses at large upon the merits of all the machines . He exhibits all the varieties of needles employed in them , and expatiates upon the very complicated machinery used to propel those needles . " Your own common sense must tell you , madam , that the simpler a piece of mechanism is , the less liable it is to get out of order , and the more easily it is worked by an inexperienced person . Now , madam , our machine contains eleven pieces less than any other in the market , and your own common sense must tell you that every piece added to a machine makes it more complicated , and more easily disarranged . Do n't misunderstand me , madam ; I do not say that the machine you examined on the other side of the street was not a very rrood one in its day ; but some people , you know , when they have a pretty good thing , are satisfied , and do n't keep up with the times . However , we never speak ill of our neighbors . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do . May , Your own common sense must decide . " And so he goes on , until the lady shudders to think what a narrow escape she has had from falling a victim to the wiles of the brilliant young man who first entertained her . By the time she has gone the rounds of the ten or twelve sewing-machine establishments in Broadway between Canal Street and Union Square , she is in a state of mind to buy a wheelbarrow in order to end the agonizing struggle . Jo truth , ladies , there is no such thing as an absolutely and universally best sewing-machine . Each has its special merits , which make it the best for some purposes . No machine exists which will sew equally well the sole-leather for a trunk and the cambric of a chemisette . The machine that is best for a family of young children may not be the best for a family of grown daughters , who go to balls and want new cloaks every winter . The machine that is best for a farmer* s wife may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but though not the best , it is so good that she could hardly be made to believe there could be a better . Ve find , accordingly , that every lady believes firmly in the sewmg-machine which she is so fortunate as to possess . It is but just to add , that all the wellknown makers have seized the truth , that the only way in which a business permanently great can be created , is by serving the public with systematic and scrupulous fidelity . Nothing can exceed the care taken by them all that no machine shall leave the factory which shall not be , as long as it lasts , an anvertisenient for the company whose name it bears .
