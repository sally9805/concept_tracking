txt ART . IX . - History of West Point ; its Military Importance during the American Revolution , and the Origin and Progress of the United States Military Academy . By Captain EDWARD C. BOYNTON , A. M. , Adjutant of the Military Academy . New York : D. Van Nostrand. 1863 . THE simplename of West Point is of as wide and varied significance as that of any spot in American geography . It has more than one special history , and yet all its histories are blended together in harmonious connection , linking the past with the present , the physical with the moral , the glories of our " heroic age with the stern necessities , and , let us hope , the greater glories of present power and justice and hope . The spirit of Washington still walking upon its plain , and speaking from its inland summits , inspires and encourages the youthful soldiers who are , perhaps , yet to strike manful blows against a mighty treason , and lend their aid in saving the country which he and his worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardship and despondency . West Point may be considered , then , in reference to its importance as a military position in the Revolutionary period ; or it may be treated in its character as the seat of the only military school of the nation . In the former view , it is full of undying interest , and might // 581 readily demand all our space . The military student sees in it a decisive strategic point , of great importance to both the American and British armies . To the British its possession was an object of great value , because , could they occupy it , they would remove the chief obstacle to a junction between the forces of General Sir Henry Clinton in New York and those of General Burgoyne in Canada . To keep the navigation of the Hudson River clear and unimpeded was to have the means of sending supplies and troops in either direction , and thus to have two noble bases of operation , - New York city , with its splendid harbor , and Canada , with its importations of men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans it was of double and most vital importance . Not only did its bold , fortified headland , its terraced forts and batteries , and its flanking redoubts on Constitution Island and the opposite shore , impede the junction of the British forces and their use of the river , but it protected the single , well-guarded ferry which kept open the communication between the Patriot forces in New England and those in the Middle and Southern States . It is not too much to say , that the permanent loss of this post would have done more to retard our final success than any other military event that could have occurred at that time , and possibly have so discouraged our armies as to lead to some unsatisfactory compromise . Early engaging the attention of the Congress , boards of officers were appointed by whom plans were devised for a thorough system of fortification , which should include Martelaer 's Rock on Constitution Island , both banks of the Hudson , and means for the obstruction of the river , to prevent British vessels from passing in either direction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and soon after to General Putnam ; but before the plans could be carried out , a large and well-appointed force , under Sir Henry Clinton , swept up from New York , in October , 177T , stormed Forts Montgomery and Fort Clinton , and threatened to secure the desired junction with Burgoyne . But that general was having his own troubles in the net of // Saratoga . To the inexpressible mortification of Sir Henry Clinton , the news came that Burgoyne had surrendered to Gates ; and so , after occupying West Point for not more than twenty days , Clinton dismantled the works , and took himself back to his head-quarters in New York . From this lesson , sad as it was , the Americans learned wisdom . The fortifications , modified by their late painful experience , were pushed forward with great vigor . A great boom and chain - some links of the latter are still preserved at West Point - were stretched across the river , and the Hudson , as a strategic line , was entirely lost to the English . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret efforts afterwards to obtain possession of it , through the intrigues of Andr6 and the treachery of Arnold . But to the student of military history it presents other claims . Here Washington had his head-quarters for a time ; here he issued the order of congratulation to General Wayne for his brilliant storming of Stony Point ; here , in an order still preserved at the Military Academy , he denounced the irreligious and utimanly vice of profane swearing . But , besides such interests , here was the scene of the rarest , because the most real , romance of the Revolution , - truth stranger and more hearf.stirring than any fiction . Here Arnold sold his country , in devilish purpose at least , and his soul , for ten thousand pounds and a British epaulette ; and here , to gain the great strategic point of the North for his king and his general , Andr6 madly threw away a bright young life , which might have become , in more honorable actions , as famous as that of the captor of Quebec . His sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , also displays the good common-sense and incorruptible firmness of Washington , which called forth the anathemas of British poetry , the denunciations of Lord Mahon , and the admiration of his own countrymen . The story , in all its details , is never old . We recur to it with new interest whenever we think of West Point in the Revolution . Thus much of the Revolutionary history . Besides these historic charms , Nature has endowed the spot with fairest beauties . It is a place for a poet to dream in . The broad expanse of the // Upper Hudson , shut in by distant Newburg , is like a noble lake in some alpine region . Cro ' nest and its companion summits , a thousand feet high , rise beetling over the little skiff which drifts at their feet , grander than Ehrenbreitstein and " the castled crag of Drachenfels . " Wandering backward from its present beauties to the hallowed memories of the older day , the poet tunes his harp to tell how " Sights and sounds at which the world have wondered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freedom 's cannon from these glens have thundered , And sent their startling echoes o'er the earth ; And not a verdant glade nor mountain hoary But treasures up within the glorious story . " Truly , in other pages , and under other inspirations , West Point , had it no other history , would tempt the man of fancy and feeling to emulate the poet in other fables suggested by the genius loci , a spirit at once Protean , fantastic , and fascinating . But the older history and the perennial poetry of the place are not within our present scope . The former is to be found most carefully and lucidly set forth in Captain Boynton 's excellent and elaborate book ; and the latter remains , as far as we are now concerned , whether it burst into song or not , the possession of every sensitive soul that visits the beautiful spot , " When the moon looks down on old Cro ' nest , And softens the shades on his shaggy breast . " The design of this paper is chiefly to consider the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress , its practical workings , and its results . The prominent part it is playing in the present war has made it a topic of wide discussion . It has its sworn friends , ready to do battle for it a l'outrance ; it has its bitter , uncompromising , hereditary enemies , who , from generation to generation , have tried to destroy it , - men who now represent the minority of sixteen , who , against the vote of ninety-five , refused to join in establishing it on a permanent basis in 1808 ; and besides these two hostile parties , there are many who can not make up their minds as to its utility , but who want instruction concerning it . To this third class we address ourselves , feeling very sure that // we can not weaken the love or add to the hatred of the other two . A dispassionate mind , then , would seek , we think , to discover its excellences , its faults , and its needs . To this investigation let us address ourselves . We must , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statistics , on the part of our readers , of which if they are ignorant , we refer them to Captain Boynton 's volume , and to General Cullum 's register of the officers and graduates , - a beadroll of honor to which all soldiers must point with admiration and pride . The first requisite of an army is good officers : they make the men . The ignorance and worthlessness of many of our officers during the Revolutionary War soon manifested the necessity of a military school ; the Steuben tactics of Valley Forge even demonstrated the power of military education to make an army out of a motley crowd of half-starved , halfnaked men . But during the fierce , protracted , and sometimes seemingly hopeless struggle of the Revolution , although committees were appointed , and discussions had in and out of Congress , it became evident that nothing could be done for military education until after the peace . It was the day of action , with whatever weapon could be grasped ; it was no time to be learning elementary modes . The peace came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappear . There were quidnuncs then - the species is not yet extinct - who applied the philosophy of the man whose roof leaked during the rain . You could not , they said , have a military academy during the war , because you were too much engaged in other matters . Now peace has come , and we do not want one . But not thus reasoned our great men . General Knox made a report , a short time after peace was concluded , strongly urging the establishment of a school for the instruction of engineer and artillery officers ; and West Point was proposed as the locality , because of its strategic importance , exposed to a coup de main , and yet the very key of the Hudson River . Thus it was designed to accomplish the double purpose of a military school and a strong military post . Washington and Jefferson , also , rendered wise by the experience of our armies , // wrote earnest letters advocating the establishment of a military academy . By reason of these and similar endeavors , the Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten years after the peace , a corps of artillery and engineers , to which a small number of cadets was attached , who were undergoing preparatory instruction for appointments in those arms . The corps and the number of cadets were increased in 1798 , and provision , although very inadequate , was made for their education in elementary branches . This , although not even the beginning of the present Military Academy , was of great value , because it was a recognition , however feeble , of the need of military education ; and the need once generally acknowledged , sooner or later it will be supplied . Such a twilight led at last to the dawning . By the act of March 16 , 1802 , the Corps of Engineers was made distinct from the Artillery , and was stationed at West Point to constitute a Military Academy . The cadets became warrant-officers of the Engineer Corps . It is not our purpose to consider the steps of legislation , always more or less impeded by the opposition of ignorant men , by which the Military Academy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cadets and a few officers of the army as instructors , to its present eminent usefulness , with a faculty of authoritative professors and instructors , superior in numbers and composition , we believe , to that of any institution of learning in the country , with its corps of two hundred and fifty cadets , soon doubtless to be increased , and its long and brilliant list of alumni , whose names not only adorn our annals of war on every battle-field of this century , but are also intimately associated with the prosperity and honor of the country in all its pacific progress and relations . If we search for the principal periods in its history , we shall find them sufficiently marked to indicate its progress at a passing glance . In 1801 , before the legislation which incorporated the present institution , we are told that it was " under the direction of a private citizen ( George Barrow ) , and was nothing more than a mathematical school for the few cadets that were theii in service . " Then came the new order of things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time there is // little of importance to record until 1808 , when we find it under the energetic direction of Colonel Jonathan Williams , of the Engineers , the first superintendent , whose report of that year gives us clear information of its character and condition . Even then it was struggling for life . In the words of Colonel Williams , - " The Military Academy , as it now stands , is like a foundling , barely existing among the mountains , and nurtured at a distance out of sight , and almost unknown to its legitimate parents . The questions that have been frequently put to the subscriber by members of Congress , evidently show that the little interest the institution has excited arises solely from its being unknown to those who ought to be , and doubtless would willingly become , its generous guardians and powerful protectors . Had it been so attached to the government ( its real and only parent ) as to be always with it , always in sight , and always in the way of its fostering care , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and interesting appendage to the national family . " This attachment to the government was exactly what it needed , but it was to strengthen only as the Academy gave proofs of its utility , as it was to do in the troublous times immediately following this report . Although war with England did not actually break out until 1812 , the prospect of it was close and immiiient for four years preceding the declaration . In 1812 , the military necessities of the country placed the Military Academy upon something more like its present basis . The number of the Professors was increased by the establishment of chairs of Natural and Experimental Philosophy , of Mathematics , and of English studies . A chaplain was appointed , and the maximum number of cadets placed at two hundred and sixty . And yet there was much to be done . System and order were needed . Captain Boynton , speaking of the condition of things at that time , says : " The cadets were not regarded as amenable to martial law , no class-rank was established , no register of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to positions in the army , they demanded the right to elect such corps as seemed to them most satisfactory . " A master hand was needed to arrange a system and to put it into successful operation . And that master hand was found in the person of Brevet-Major Sylvanus Tliayer , of the Corps // of Engineers , who became the Superintendent in 1817 . Major Thayer remodelled the entire system of interior arrangements , supplying much that was original and excellent . Himself an early graduate of the Academy , who had vindicated the teachings of his Alma Mater by his personal conduct in the war of 1812 , lie had also studied abroad in the military schools of France , and had given special attention to the subject of military education . He thus brought to his task intelligence , well-digested practical knowledge combined with great energy , and , more than all , a peculiar gift of natural fitiiess , which soon displayed astoiiishing results . The historian of West Point , although required to give the earlier statistics of its progress , must date the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its almost chaotic elements into a working system , to the Superintendency of Major ( now Colonel ) Thayer . He organized the cadets into a battalion of two companies , further divided for purposes of drill into eight , and appoiiited meritorious and soldierly cadets as officers . This latter was , and has since proved itself , an admirable system , inciting the cadets to an honorable rivalry , and giving them practical instruction in command . He also established the office of " Commandant of cadets , " who should be the instructor in tactics ; and to this office were appointed by selection the most accomplished officers of the army . We need only mention the names of General Worth and General C. F. Smith , who were Commandants at different times , to show what models were placed before the cadets as infantry soldiers . In the department of catechetical instruction Major Thayer was equally active and creative . He divided the classes into sections of from eight to twelve cadets each , so that each cadet , as a general rule , recited every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass this ! - and required the publication to the cadets of weekly marks , so that every cadet might know exactly where he stood at the end of every week , - another plan which we commend to our colleges . Major Thayer established class-rank , published an annual register , in which the classes were arranged according to merit , // gave great preponderance to the blackboard in recitations , compiled the excellent Regulations of the Military Academy , and introduced several new branches of study . In 1818 , Mr. Calhoun was the Secretary of War , and , however the country , to the latest generations , must abhor those principles which were at least one powerful source of the later mammoth treason , West Point owes much to his fostering care and attention . In a letter to the Superintendent , written in February , 1818 , he declares the determination of the Department " to aid in elevating the system of discipline , and to create a spirit of emulation among the cadets , " and he adds " that in future wars the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valor to victory . " It was by direction of Mr. Calhoun , in furtherance of this determination , that the names of the five most distinguished cadets in each class were annually published , as a mark of honor , in the Army Register . In the same year two general examinations of the cadets were established , in January and June , and Boards of Visitors were appointed to the June examination , selected from the most distinguished citizens in different parts of the country . Cadets were also now finally declared to be amenable to martial law , and brought before courts-martial for trial . We are sorry , for want of space , to pass over in few words the useful administrations of Major De Russy , Colonel Delafield , and Colonel Brewerton . Under the two last the post of West Point was greatly improved , many new houses built , and the efficiency of the Academy in every way increased . The present Rebel generalissimo , Lee , was also for a short time the Superintendent , and a very efficient one , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of War , gave a new and most interesting feature to the Academy by the introduction of horses for cavalry and artillery exercise , thus giving completeness to the institution as an instructor in all parts of a military education . From that time there has been continual progress and development , and West Point at this time may claim not only to give the most thorough instruction in the branches it professes to teach , but to furnish as complete and harmonious a connection of those branches as it is possible // to adjust in one Academy and in the period of four years . We may state , in passing , that the average annual cost of the Academy to the country in late years is about $160,000 ; while the entire expense to the government , from 1802 to 1863 , is $ * , 133,235. *I0 . Let the intelligent reader decide whether this is much or little . Let him weigh the manifold duty done , in one scale , against the ponderable gold , in the other . Before leaving this part of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Visitors , who annually assemble to witness the June examination , and to report to the War Dcpartment upon the condition of the Institution . In one view , they are beneficial . Appointed , by a regular system , from the different portions of the country , and from among men of influence , they keep the institution before the people , and carry with them to their distant homes some idea of its plan and its workings . But the members are generally selected , not for their military knowledge , but simply because they are men of station . They rarely bring intelligeixt scrutiny to their task , and as a general rule the reports of the Board of Visitors have no weight with the Department . It would be far better for the President to appoint distinguished military men on such boards , or to have distinct boards of inspection , one to please and give general information concerning the institution to the people , and the other to report intelligently upon the wants and faults of the Academy , with a view to their speedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the origin and progress of the Military Academy , we pass to the consideration of a few of the leading questions concerning the value of West Point to the nation . Is it a success ? Has it been useful ? Is it worth the outlay ? Should it be sustained , and even enlarged ? At first glance , we might wonder that these questions are ever asked ; but , strange as it may seem , there are not wanting those who seriously propound them . While a large number - including , without an exception , we believe , all those who have had the honor to graduate there - are enthusiastic concerning its great excellence , its thorough teaching , the noble and brilliant actions of its graduates from the beginning , there have been , as we have already stated , in all periods of its // legislative history , bitter and uncompromising enemies , in and out of Congress , who have done everything in their power to break it up entirely , and leave us without any military school . Let us look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some patriotic men it has been due to the fear of a military establishment , or even the nucleus of one , a miniature pr*-torian guard , which might endanger the liberties of the country . To such minds the pruning-hook is in great danger from the sword ; a uniform is the Devil 's livery , and an army only at home in Pandemonium . These abstract views , not espoused by the many , find a fallacious support in the assertion that a well-disciplined militia is the bulwark of the commonwealth . We want no army ; the people are army enough . But those who torture this noble truth into a weapon against West Point , neglect to consider that good discipline must come by education , and West Point is after all only a training school to fit men to discipline the militia . Without this training , militia , as meaning soldiery , is a misnomer . Again , the necessarily small number of cadets at one school , in so large and growing a country as ours , has led to the disappointment of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men become bitter . Grapes that can not be reached after the most vigorous leaps , are sour ; and so West Point is denounced . And yet again , when , through the rigorous but just discipline of the Academy , it happens that the sons or relatives of narrow-minded and selfish men are dismissed for incompetence or misbehavior , the fathers or uncles feel themselves in honor and duty bound to oppose and attack an institution that dared to send away " one who was destined , under proper training and human nature , and there is no more to be said concerning it . But we are told that West Point men are scornful and unkind in their treatment of volunteer officers , and that the latter become jealous and retaliatory . The vast difference , as a general rule , in military intelligence and utility between regular and volunteer officers may explain this , and we are compelled to allow that often tIme accusation // is just , based as it is , however , upon a fallacy . To this we shall presently recur . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the den , " may be mentioned as prime causes of the hostility which has been manifested towards the Military Academy ; but surely our readers will see at a glance that such motives , and the actions to which they lead , are not worthy of serious consideration . If they exist as we have stated them , they fall to the ground by their own weight , and we need waste no logic upon them . Were it proper to cite individual cases , we could give numerous illustrations under each head . But the question is not with such men , or their opinions . Let us rather study the character of West Point in its intrinsic and extrinsic relations , and inquire into the valid objections which may be made to it . We shall thus see whether it has succeeded in giving a good military education ; in what respects it has failed ; what it needs to make it better ; or , if radically wrong , how it may be reconstructed and improved . Of course , we take for granted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire destruction . Let us put our investigation in the form of answers to the patent objections which have been brought against it . The principal objection now made against West Point training is , that it has not made great generals . It educates , and dwarfs in the process , drill officers , instead of making cornmanders . Of course , those who make this objection will concede that it is equally forcible against all elementary military instruction in the actual art of war . No military knowledge , as such , can make generals . Generalship ( o*rparfl7ia , the art of leading armies ) is genius , a gift of God to individuals ; it is only soldiership that is an acquisition . But it is a truism to say that genius is most useful when fully instructed . As the poet who " is born " does not and can not scorn learning and culture , so the general must be an educated soldier . The " Iliad " is the compend of the early Greek culture ; an inspired Moses is learned in all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owes its wondrous and powerful delineations not more to the wild imagination of the exiled Florentine than to // his varied knowledge of poetry , polity , and history , to the wars of Guelf and Ghibelline , Pope and Emperor . Milton must range over the entire scope of Grecian learning , borrowing from ? schylus and the later poets some of his choicest fancies and most striking expressions . But why need we illustrate by " analogous instances " ? Ca*sar must use the Tenth Roman Legion , perfected for him at an earlier period and by other men ; Parma , the forts and bridges of Italian origin ; Frederick , the matchless drill of his father 's tall grenadiers ; and Napoleon , not only the tactics , organization , and cannon of the earlier wars of the Republic , but the early training under Pichegru and other eminent masters at the military school of Brienne . Generals , then , are born and made . Genius is the germinating seed , development its growth into the full and stately tree . But further to carry out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the wind and the rain , the light and the air , which must nurture this slow and real growth . The making process is slow and hard , whatever be the genius . But granting that generals can not be altogether made , that the germ must pre-exist , that great commanders are great geniuses , how is it with the large masses of men who aspire to be officers ,  --  with the subordinates , who in numbers bear the proportion to generals of thousands to units ? These stand in closer and more intimate relations with the soldiers : these should certainly be educated . Let us grant that they have only ordinary talent , such as men bring to the various business by which they gain their livelihood ; what is to render this most useful ? what but military education , an encyclopaedia of natural sciences and industrial arts , mathematics , mechanics , physics , history , directly applied in all branches of the military art , with a knowledge of such languages as enable research in these branches , and enlarged communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Point should meet the sneers with which some speak of West Point generals , first , with the concession that West Point can not and does not arrogate omnipotence in giving men original genius , and then let them point to Grant , McClellan , Halleck , Meade , Hancock , Hooker , Rosecrans , Sherman , Reynolds , Sedgwick , and a hundred // others , as a tacit assertion that West Point has so fostered and instructed , if it have not created , genius , that no uneducated genius has been found fit to take the place of its educated developments . Quite as striking are the illustrations of military excellence among West Point men in the Rebel armies . Lee , Beauregard , Longstreet , both the Hills , Ewell , Johnston , ilardee , and a score of others , traitors and rebels though they be , are admirable soldiers and excellent generals . Where are the exceptions on either side ? There are a few , among whom Banks and Butler may be named , but they are very few in *omparison with the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be further observed , that the young men whoreceive appointments to West Point , in most cases , manifest in earlier life a decided bent towards a military career ; they think they find in themselves a genius for war , just as one boy does for trade , or another for the bar , or a third for medicine ; and we shall see that we are more likely to find military genius at West Point than anywhere else . Another objection takes the harsh , and we think mistaken form , that West Point , which should , above all other institutions , inculcate national and patriotic sentiments , has been in reality a nest of treason , out of which rebels spring full-fledged at the first tocsin note of Southern treason . With the deepest sorrow , dissatisfaction , and regret at the defection of so many of our best West Point officers when the war began , we can not but regard this assertion as based upon an entire error . We speak from certain and intimate knowledge of a long period of West Point history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality was ever placed in the fore-front of instruction and practice there ; that the standard which displays it was always duly honored as our only emblem of sovereignty ; that the morning gun which accompanied its graceful rise upon the flag-staff , and the reverberations that told of its nightly descent , taught their daily lesson of reverence and love ; that a sectional opinion was never set forth ; that the Constitution of the United States , as yearly expounded , was made to teach its truest lesson , that the Unioii meant our country , and that disunion was the rankest treason . If , then , we are asked to account for the resignation of so // many of our best officers at the very first call of Secession , the answer is very simple . It was the result of that mistaken , pernicious , unconstitutional doctrine of State Rights which had been so long taught at the South , which had been fostered by a difference of manners , customs , and interests , principally due to slavery , and which was not a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small one , at the North . Many of the young men who were sent to West Point had these principles instilled into them before they went , and while there were by no means removed from home teachings . The best , the most patriotic instructions of West Point , were not proof against the seductions of friends and the enticements of home . Principle is weak against such allurements . Many struggled hard against the enemy in the form of the Siren . Lee , one of the very best men among the Rebel leaders , an ornament to our arms before his disgrace , thought long and in solitude , with bitter tears and many prayers , before he flung away his loyalty for no better reason than a mistaken interpretation of the grand motto , Noblesse oblige . Stone wall Jackson , one of the grandest soldiers of the age , twirled his thumbs for an hour , and satisfied himself without a scrap of logic to help him ; - " Secession is wrong , bitt , if Virgin in secedes , I must go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fought , except at Antietam , off Virginia soil , and then he declared he was fighting in her defence . Indeed , he is asserted to have said distinctly that he would not fight elsewhere for the Confederacy . Huger held on long , and then , resigning , declared that he would remain neutral . How impossible ! Longstreet , urged by his uncle , who had strenuously opposed Secession at first , remained in our service until his State seceded , and then , as he retired , declared that he would never fight against the old flag . Would that he had kept his word ! Was West Point responsible for these things ? As well charge upon Cambridge teaching the fact that her Southem alumni are now in Southern ranks , as charge the army defection to West Point . But treason is treason , and the shades are not very different , whether it lead Floyd and Cobb and Slidell and others to leave the fat offices of the capital for what they hope will prove fatter offices in the " Confederacy , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a closer // analogy , quite as well charge the navy with being a school of treason and hotbed of Secession , because Maury deserted his astronomic post , and Semmes and Maflit bravely burn helpless merchantmen , while they are very careful to elude the guns of our men-of-war . But it is further urged that West Point is too exclusive . This charge refers , first , to the comparatively small number of cadets ; secondly , to the mode of appointment ; and thirdly , by a slight straining of the word , to the conduct and deportment of its graduates in the army . Let us look at these objections in their order . As to the small numbers that may be educated there , it should be remembered that the Academy was established on its present basis to supply our military needs in the day of small things ; and , to show that it was more than sufficient for that day , we may state that , when the Mexican war l ) roke out , and even after the battles of Palo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the shape of supernumerary officers , attached to the different arms as Brevet Second Lieutenants . In the artillery arm alone there were more than twenty , who , however , were quickly absorbed by the losses in the succeeding Mexican battles . Our present needs are immeasurably greater , and the objection in this form is of great force . The number of cadets should be increased , or other schools established to instruct in partial military courses . In considering the second form of the objection , which is brought against the mode of appointment , we are also obliged to acknowledge its validity . The members of Congress in both houses have each the nomination of a cadet , not annually , but for the four years ' course . The President of the United States has the power to appoint a few at large , or from no special district or locality . We believe that the appointments have been honestly made , and as well as this mode will allow . There has been little if any nepotism . Poor men 's sons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rich and influential . In what , then , is the system faulty ? In that the appointers are not always competent judges , or can not take the trouble to inquire much into the merits of special cases . Thus numbers go to West Point only to be sent away after a short sojourn ; they incur the disgrace of dismission , and carry // to all the points of the compass harsh and false statements of West Point rigors and injustice . But a far greater evil grows out of this . As each member of Congress can appoint but one , practically it often happens that only one or two can come before him with such claims as seem to merit his consideration . To remove these evils , we propose that examining boards should be appointed - of competent officers - in various parts of the country , and that all young men of a certain age and physical soundness , who can bring testimonials of good moral character , and a prescribed amount of preparatory knowledge , should be permitted to appear before these boards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon some of the subjects now taught in the first year at West Point , with a view of enlarging and elevating the curriculum there . In this way the best material would he obtained , the positions would be thrown open to universal competition , and the existing error of exclusiveness , growing out of the mode of appointment , be entirely removed . No harm can thus be done to anybody , while great good will accrue to the service . There remains to be considered , under this general and somewhat vague head of exclusiveness , the charge of arrogance on the part of the 61*ves of the Military Academy . They look , it is said , with contempt upon all others , and despise even the honest efforts of volunteers to do their duty . Frankly confessing that this charge , sometimes at least , is not without foundation in truth , we must seek for the causes of such deportment before a final judgment upon it . We shall not justify it , but we think former circumstances , not hereafter to be pleaded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We speak , of course , only of the conduct of West Point officers to other men in military positions ; for in the great world , and to the mass of citizens , graduates of West Point are favorites , partly because of their manly bearing acquired in their early training . More than any other diploma in the country , that of the West Point graduate has been received as a passport to good society ; it is even recognized abroad as the readiest claim of admission into the best circles . To come back , then , to military men and matters , it is to be regretted that West Point men ever put on , as some do , an air // 547 of contemptuous superiority towards volunteer and militia offi .. cers . What is the ground for such conduct ? In the forLner days , when the army was small , there were very few regular officers - only here and there one - who were appointed from civil life . The roll of officers was made up almost entirely of West Point men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions , civilians who became officers in the army gained their appointments through family influence , and were ignorant of the first principles of the military art , and mistaken in their conception of a soldier 's life . Appointed to fill vacancies for which cadets had been struggling for four years , many of them dropped off from time to time , to avoid exposure , leaving the few real and honorable exceptions to pursue their solitary career . It was at such a time , and towards such men , that the contempt or arrogance of the graduates was mainly displayed . It would have been better , indeed , to have done all in their power to elevate and educate the citizen thus appointed ; but , wrong as it was , it was more natural for them to manifest an impatience at ignorance and inaptitude , and a dissatisfaction at the neglect of the claims of anxious and expectant cadets . But the complaint goes further , and justly too . It may be brought against the manner in which our regular officers have treated volunteers when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the education . of the one and the common ignorance of the other , this was manifestly wrong . The volunteers who , in any war , give up business and comfort to support the honor of our arms , deserve great credit for their self-denial , and great patience with their early lack of military knowledge . Our experience has been , that they are eager to learn , modest in their endeavors , and acquire tactical knowledge rapidly . It is just at the beginning that they need counsel and comfort , instead of contemptuous rebuke , such as they have too often met . But let no one , in his eagerness to support the volunteers , doubt for an instant that the real difference existed . In Mexico , when a battery was to be stormed , more than once have brave volunteers said , " Give us a company of regulars to lead us . " West Point men , educated from childhood to be soldiers // by profession , sometimes forget what is due to patriotism and valor without pretension , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons ; we attempt no further vindication . But all this , as to reasons at least , and we hope as to facts , is now changed . Honoring as we do the noble education imparted at West Point , we must see that there is another vast school of the military art and of military practice , in which the pupils number more than half a million . When Napoleon said to the cammissaire who objected to give him an important command on account of his youth , " One grows old rapidly on the field of battle , ' ? his remark implied that one learned rapidly , gathered in months what book-knowledge would not teach in years , and , thus acquiring the practical , reasoned back with the greatest ease to the merely theoretical . And now West Point men , although they have a better basis of knowledge , although still and ever in the front of the military profession , have not the shadow of an excuse for assuming superiority to veteran volunteers , who have learned their best drill under many a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immortal battle-fields of the Republic . It is worth inquiry whether the Military Academy has not been kept too isolated from the great world . It is shut off topographically on a narrow point , guarded on all sides from ingress and egress . Unlike other colleges , it has not frequent vacations . For two years without intermission the cadets are there enclosed , and , although engaged in vigorous exercises of mind and body , they are as complete monks as ever dwelt in Yallombrosa , in duties , in dress , in conventual customs of cell and refectory . Then for a brief space of a month and a half they come out to see the great world , only to return to a similar monachism for two years more . We doubt the excellence of this system . It keeps them up in their studies , but it keeps them also from a knowledge of the world , at the very age when that knowledge is best obtained . The Academy is their microcosm . If the Military Academy were placed in the heart of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see all that was to be seen , to be educated as citizens , while they were ac // quiring the knowledge of the military art , - taken to inspect fortifications , to join the great processions on national festivals , to see new men-of-war , the founding of mammoth guns , the workings of the great industrial world , - we honestly think it would be far better for them and for the country ; and all this might be done without lowering the standard of scholarship or soldiership in the sligfitest degree . But , again , we are told that the standard of scholarship is too rigorous ; that it sends away , for deficiency in one unimportant branch , those who excel in all others , and would make excellent soldiers . We have not time to dwell upon this subject . One thing is certain , for every young man sent away because he fails in one branch , another is appointed who will succeed in all . What can be fairer than this , especially when the government pays for entire excellence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had much more to say , but our space is already filled . By a comparison of the West Point curriculum with those of European military colleges , we find it the most complete as a preparation for any and all arms . All the cadets learn the entire course . The engineer officer is thorough in infantry tactics , the infantry graduates know how to build forts and work guns . There is a harmony of knowledge thus imparted . In the French and English schools there are special courses for the various arms , which carry the pupil farther in special studies , but do not give him the same general scope of military knowledge . As our armies are at present constituted , the West Point system is better for us than that of English or French schools . In our present exigency , military instruction , gc*nerally confined to infantry and artillery tactics , is being introduced into a great number of our colleges and schools . That this will be but a temporary thing in many of them we must believe ; but in the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States government , so that it may grow into an important component of the department of the arts . Long a warlike people , we are becoming , we must be , a military nation , and the best assurance of success will be , to teach all our sons that noble art which can defend our freedom , and // hurl back the invader , with readiness , address , and the Least bloodshed . West Point must ever be the great mother of our future educational development in arms ; while we cherish her , let us improve and increase her utility , and join to her elementary instruction such excellent schools of army practice as shall extend the knowledge of the art of war in America , and , by rendering us more formidable , diminish the chances of war . We can not close without thanking Captain Boynton for the vast amount of information so well collated in his book , and for his clear statement of the history and condition of the Academy from the beginning to the present time .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
