ARTICLE IV. - PROFESSOR FISHER 'S LIFE OF BENJAMIN SILLIMAN . Life of Benjamin Silliman , M. D. , LL . D. , Professor of Chemistry , Mineralogy , and Geology in Yale College . Chiefly from his Manuscript Reminiscences , Diaries , and Correspondence . By GEORGE P. FIsHER , Professor in Yale College . New York : Charles Scribner &amp; Co. 1866. 2 vols. l2mo . THE lesson which the lives of most men seem designed of God to teach us is that of the imperfection and incompleteness of this world . They are so hindered in their work , and beset with sorrows and trials , and filled with a thousand limitations , and even broken off in years before the end , that , as we look upon them , one by one , they become to our view a mass of fragments only , almost useless in themselves , except as they point to a more perfect future ; and the wonder of divine wisdom and power is that they can be taken up into one farreaching plan , and made to form the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at rare intervals , a life is lived which is full and complete on every side ,  --  one which is strikingly marked ih its peacefulness and success , in the fulfillment of all its purposes , and in the continual happiness of all its years , from earliest youth to the ripeness of old age  --  the spirit passing away at the last , with the confidence of triumphant faith and hope , into the glories of the unseen world , only after it seems to have gathered to itself , in most abundant measure , every blessing that this world could give for its enjoyment . In the vision of such a life we lose sight , for the moment , of disappointment and imperfection , while there are revealed before us , as if from heaven , the possibilities of our human nature even here , as they might have been if sin had not brought its train of evils upon our race , and the earthly history had been only the beautiful opening of an immortal existence . We have been often impressed with a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have reflected upon the story of that most wonderfal and illustrious course through which Washington was led on to the accomplishment of his great work  --  the greatest in the history of civil liberty  --  and have seen how perfect , at every step , was the fullness of his life and being . Beyond the work which was assigned to him of God , and for which he so mnani* festly was raised up as the means of securing God 's gift to the world , there was in himself-in the progress of his career as viewed in itself-something that seemed like a display before mankind of the perfection of the divine workmanship , of the possible beauty of the divine creation . A man of far different powers , indeed , from Washington , and destined for a widely different work , in a much more limited sphere , but yet a man whose long life of more than eighty years exhibited somewhat of a similar out*vard completeness , was the one whose record of his own course is given in the volumes before us . As the tidings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the day of national Thanksgiving , and our thoughts were turned backward to the past  --  to think of the manly beauty of his person , and the quiet joy of his home , and the brilliant success of his working ; of th * ingathering upon him , during so many years , of honors and rewards , and the freedom of his life , in so large a measure , from the sorrows allotted to most men , and the buoyant hopefulness that had always sustained his cheerful spirit ; of the green and fresh and hearty old age , which shone so brightly upon all around him , and rejoiced so greatly as it laid aside the burdens that had been borne for half a century ) and the happy death which seemed , in the time and manner of its coming , to be the crowning gift of heaven , even above all that had preceded it , and the Christian hope , with which no painful doubt was mingled , that the brightness of the past was only fading away before a greater and ceaseless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanksgiving might fitly rise to the Divine Father , that he had caused to be lived , even in our presence , so large a portion of so full a life , and that , amid the sorrow which comes so constantly as friends are passing away around us , whether in youth or age , because their work and course are really unfinished , here was one life over whose ending we could only rejoice , in the thought that // it was perfectly and beautifully finished . And whatever may be said of the record that now lies open to the reader for his perusal and his judgment , in other respects , we can not but believe that every one will sympathize with us in the same feeling as the life here displays itself , and will acknowledge this wonderful outward completeness , which appears in the story as it did in the career itself . It would be impossible for us , within the limits of a short Article like the present , even did we desire to do so , to follow out the details of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers with the completeness of which we speak . To do this would be to repeat the narrative as it is given by Professor Silliman himself We can only call attention briefly to the course of his life , to the work which he accomplished , and to some of his characteristics , and hope that we may thereby do something to awaken pleasant recollections in the minds of many who knew him in years past , while at the same time we commend to them the work before us , if they would see him as he was . Those who thus , by the perusal of these volumes , refresh their memory of his character and life , we are sure will rise from their reading with a just appreciation of the man . Having been born in 1779 , he came fbrward into life as a young man just at the opening of the present century . Yale College had , at that time , recently passed under the direction and guardianship of President Dwight , and was opening towards a new career of usefulness and prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been little more than a high school under another name . Illustrious men had , indeed , presided over it at different times , and it had fulfilled , in a satisfactory manner , the noble design of its founders , in preparing large numbers of educated youth for the ministry of the gospel . But the possibilities of the age , in the way of broad culture and large ideas of learning , were then of necessity very limited ; while the thought of any instruction beyond that of one pernianent officer surrounded by a continually changing body of Tutors seems scarcely to have entered the mind of any one . The new era , with the rapid growth of the country which was already commencing and // giving prophetic assurances of the future , was bringing a new demand for literary institutions of a higher order , and offering the reward of the first rank and the widest celebrity to those who earliest saw and met the need . Probably no man ever appeared at an opportune moment , who was more admirably fitted for the work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind open to the value and the glory of knowledge in every line ,  --  with a wisdom that grasped not only the small things of the present but the great things of the future , laying its plans ever with an outlook far beyond the limits of his own lifetime or even the thoughts of ordinary men ,  --  with a heart large enough to take in the interests of all who might be called to labor with him , though in fields far different from his own , and generous enough to sustain them by his sympathy and encoura ( rino ' counsel or assistance ,  --  and with a power of discov * b ering the excellences and adaptations of other men , which was especially essential in one whose office it was to raise up a company of youthful associates for an untried work , he seemne to have been sent of God from his retired parish at Greenfield Hill to bring about a new creation  --  to change the school of the past into a College , and lay the foundations of what should be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which Mr. Sillimnan was a member was the second that was graduated tinder Dr. Dwight 's ad irtinistration ; Doubtless even at that early day , the President 's discerning mind had seen the promise of the youth betbre him , but when , a few years later , the voun g graduate had successfully discharged the duties of the Tutorship , it became more manifest that there were possibilities withih him which might be of incalculable benefit to the institution . It is evident from the simple narrative before us , that the needs of natural science as a part of college education had been , for a considerable period , a subject of much thought with Dr. Dwight , and that he had been devising the means , as well as urging upon the Trustees of the College the importance of providing a permanent teacher in this department of learning . That it was done with an especial energy at this time , because lie saw at hand a man to whom he believed the interests of Natural Science in the Cob lege could be wisely committed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he should be retained in the College service if possible , is equally clear . But those who know much of the slow movements b** which alone changes can be made , and even the most ne3essary steps in advance can be taken in our great educational institutions ,  --  far slower , probably , sixty years ago than now ,  --  will only wonder that the youth had not passed away into another field of labor and become so established in some other profession as to be no longer at the call of the College , before the necessary funds could be provided for the new Professorship . As we , at this remote day , look back over the finished career and trace out all that was accomplished during its many years , we can only see the Divine guidance and the Divine ble ' *sino ' attendino ' the efforts of that great man , whom the b b Divine wisdom had already inspired to appreciate the demands of the coming age , and to meet those demands by such a wise selection . The narrative here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while , at the same time , it gives so clearly the views and thoughts of Dr. Dwight , that we feel instified in making an extract of some length , for the purpose of calling it more distinctly to the reader 's attention . After a brief review of the condition of things with regard to physical science in the College at the close of the last century , when , to use the language of the writer , " Chemistry was scarcely ever named , " and after the setfing forth of a l ) roposal , which was made to him , to take charge of a large academy near Savannah , in Georgia , in connection with which he was assured that lie might find the means of establishing himself successfully in his chosen profession of the law , Mr. Sillimnan pi-oceeds as follows : " While I was deliberating upon this important subject , I met President Dwight , one very warm morning in July , 1801 , under the shade of the grand trees in the street in front of the college buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conversation ensued . He had been a warm personal friend of my deceased father ; and their residences being but three miles apart ,  - -  Holland Hill and Greenfidd Hill , both in Fairfield ,  --  an active interest was maintained between them and their families . The President having ever , and particularly since his accession to the presidency in 17 9* , taken a parental interest in my brother and myself ,  --  my brother Gold S. Silliman and myself wore classmates-I felt it to be both a privilege and a duty to ask his advice on this occasion . After I had stated the case to him , he promptly replied , and with his usual decision said : I advise you not to go to Georgia . I would not volunterily , un // 1866. 513 less under the influence of some commanding moral duty , go to live in a country where slavery is established ; you must encounter moreover the dangers of the climate , and may die of a fever within two years . I have still other reasons , which I will now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that the corporation of the College had , several years before , at his recommendation , passed a vote or resolution to establish a Professorship of Chemistry and Natural History as soon as the funds would admit of it . The time , he said , had now arrived when the College could safely carry the resolution into effect . He said , however , that it was , at present , impossible to find among us a man properly qualified to discharge the duties of the office . He remarked , moreover , that a foreigner , with his peculiar habits and prejudices , would not feel and act in unison with us , and that however able he might he in point of science , he would not u derstand our college system , and might therefore not act in harmony with his colleagues . He saw no way but to select a young man worthy of confidence , and allow him time , opportunity and pecuniary aid to enable him to acquire the requisite science and skill , and wait for him until he should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own young men born and trained among us , and possessed of our habits and sympathies . " The President then did me the honor to propose that I should consent to have my name presented to the Corporation , giving me at the same time the assurance of his cordial support , and of his belief that the appointment would be made . I was then approaching twenty-two years of age-still a youth , or only entering on early manhood . I was startled and almost oppressed by the proposal . A profession ,  --  that of the law ,  --  in the study of which I was already far advanced , was to he abandoned , and a new profession was to be acquired , preceded by a course of study and of preparation too , in a direction in which in Connecticut there was no precedent . The good President perceived both my surprise and my embarrassment , and with his usual kindness and resource proceeded to remark to this effect : I could not propose to you a course of life and of effort which would promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not need you ; it is already full and many eminent men adorn our courts of justice ; you may also be obliged to cherish a hope long deferred , before success would crown your efforts in that profession ; although , if successful , you may become richer by the law than you can by science . In the profession which I proffer to you there will be no rival here . The field will he all your own . The study will be full of interest and gratification , and the presentation which you will be able to make of itto the college classes and the public will afford much instruction and delight . Our country , as regards the physical sciences , is rich in unexplored treasures , and by aiding in their development you will perform an important public service , and connect your name with the rising - eputation of our native land . Time will be allowed to make every necessary preparation ; and when you enter upon your duties , you wil speak to those to whom the subject will be new . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ly than your pupils can follow you , and will be always ahead of your audience . ' Thus encouraged by remarks so forcibly put and so kindly suggested , I expressed my earnest and most respectful thanks for the honor and advantages so unexpectedly offered to me , and asked for a few weeks for consideration and for consultation with my nearest friends . We then emerged from under the shade of // July , those noble elms , and I retird , thoughtful and pensive , to my chamber . The confidence reposed in me by President Dwight , and thus tendered in advance , increased ay sense of responsibility in view of a highly important and arduous undertaking . I felt it , however , to be a relief to escape from the practice of the law , which never appeared to me desirable . There are , indeed , bright spots in a career at the Bar ; right may be sometimes vindicated against wrong , and injured innocence protected ; but the temptati6n would often be strong-especially when backed by wealth  --  to contend against justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worse appear the better cause , and to screen the guilty from punishment , the fraudulent from the payment that is justly due . If one could always be engaged in a good cause , and could be at liberty to follow the promptings of his conscience , without suppression or perversion of truth , or concealment or palliation of wrong , then indeed the practice of law would appear most desirable and honorable ; and with requisite talent and learning , and the impulses of a generous temperament , a career at the Bar might be truly noble ; but having been a diligent and attentive listener in the courts of law during my course of study of the profession , I had seen that the beau ideal sketch was too often merely a picture of the imagination . The associations which the practice of the law creates are often highly undesirable . Often the most unworthy part of mankind throng the courts of justice , or are compelled to appear there by the mandate of law , and the practising lawyer is obliged to consort with the weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good . Such were some of the thoughts which occurred to me on the first view of the question of changing professions . On the other hand , the study of Nature appeared very attractive . In her works there is no falsehood , although there are mysteries to unveil , which is a very interesting achievenient . Everything in Nature is straightforward and consistent . There are no polluting influences ; all the associations with these pursuits are elevated and virtuous , and point towards the infinite Creator . My taste also led me in this direction , and I anticipated no sacrifice of feeling in relinquishing the prospect of practice at the Bar , although I had no occasion to regret that I had spent much time in the study of the noble science of the law , founded as it is in sound reason and ethics , and sacred to the best interests of mankind . " No one can read this long passage-which indeed will be familiar to his friends and pupils , who have heard the story from his own lips-without observing how , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new life , the plan of the college , which has since been tllowed with so much success , was formed in the mind of its President . He saw that the true course was not to go abroad for teachers in any department , for the simple reason that foreigners , through want of comprehending our system or the character of American youth , could not generally be capable of giving them the most valuable instruction ,  - -  nor , again , to call in men of advanced years who had acquired more or less of reputation in some other line , but who , by their very success elsewhere , had become disqualified for a professor 's // chair ,  --  but to train up in the college itself its own officers , educating them for their work and looking confidently to the future for their reputation and extensive usefulness . And probably in no one thing was his wisdom more conspicuous , or the course which he pursued more highly advanta*eous , than in this . He established , once for all , the traditions and customs for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young men , whom lie had chosen had become illustrious throughout the country or the world  --  the correctness of his judgment not only in his choice of individuals , but in his general views and arrangements . Yale College , in its whole history since his accession to his office - in its prosperity and in its carrying forward of the cause of sound learning-is a standing refutation of and protest against the views of those who measure all things by mere present outward fame , or of those who would call in , from every quarter , men whose chief recommendation is that they are said to be " alive " to the greatness of the age , or are able to electrity a popular audience by their eloquence . The scholars of Yale College- and they have been unsurpassed by any in the country-have been , from the beginning , the men who have grown up within her own limits ; and everything which the country owes to Yale College , it owes to these scholars , who began their work as young men , and , turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave themselves for life to the service of the institution and of letters ,  - -  waiting patiently , on the one band , for the acknowledgment of their labors when the time should come , and resisting manfully , on the other , every incoming of mere pretenders or of the false show that deceives so many . The name of Benjamin Silhiman , if it means anything , will always be to the reader of American literary history the clearest proof , that the way to success in any field of labor or of study is to give the whole life to it , from the years of opening manhood to the very end , and that the welfare of a college is best secured by the wisdom of those who live within it , and nut by the theories of those who look on only from outside its walls . We can not wonder that the young student , not vet arrived at the age of the majority of our graduating classes of to-day , // should have been " startled and even oppressed by the proposal , " or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retired thoughtfid and pensive to his chamber . " But the reflections that followed were just what we might have anticipated from such a mind and character as his . The temptations which so frequently assail the lawyer and lead him to violate , in greater or less degree , his sense of right and justice , and the by no means elevating influence of the class of men with whQm he is often , of necessity , brought in contact , must have presented themselves vividly to his thought , as he set the profession which he had chosen for himself and the one which his revered friend had chosen for him side by side . It could have required but little time for a soul of such childlike purity to decide where the attractive pathway lay ; and we can almost hear him saying to himself , in the retirement of his own room , " In Nature 's works there is no falsehood . Everything is straightforward and consistent . There are no polluting influences . All the associations are elevating and virtuous , and point towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his friends , brought him to a decision to accept the proposal which had been so unexpectedly and so kindly made . A year elapsed , however , before the final steps were taken . It was at the College Commencement , in September , 1802 , that the Corporation voted to establish the new Professorship , and in accordance with the wishes of the President elected Mr. Silhiman to fill the chair . it is difficult for us at this day ,  --  when all departments of Natural Science are pressing themselves upon the public attention , and attracting to themselves large numbers of educated young men from year to year , who find everywhere the largest facilities for the prosecution of their chosen studies .  --  to realize in any measure what the youthful Professor had to do in preparation for his work . The story seems like the dream of a distant age , instead of be . ing the simple facts in the early life of a man whom for years we ourselves knew and honored . And in the estimate not only of what lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the powers and capabilities of his own mind , we can not justly lose sight of the condition of things when the responsibilities of his office were thrown upon him . There may be men // in the future , who will find grander opportunities and do what seems to be a more magnificent work , than those who first opened the way for the higher education in our land two generations ago , but let it ne*ver be forgotten that they were creators , asit were , of everything upon which the labors and fame of other men are founded , and that the true glory of the fullgrown University in after times is to be , in no small degree , to the praise of those far-seeing minds and earnestly enthusiastic souls who prepared , in the day of small things , the way for all the future progress . Our limits will not allow us to give the narrative of Mr. Silliman 's residence in Philadelphia , preparatory to bis entrance upon his professorship , nor to speak of his early efforts in establishing his department upon a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment . It is enough to say , that his mind seemed to open at once to the requirements of his position , and to see the demands both of the present and the future . The essential importance of study abroad . if he was to make Chemistry and the other sciences assume their proper place in the College course , became manifest to him at an early day . Accordingly , in 1804 , when the President and Fellows had determined to appropriate a considerable sum for the purchase of books for the library and of philosophical and chemical apparatus , he hastened to Dr. Dwight , and suggested the plan mf securing the object proposed by sending himself to Europe , instead of employing a foreign agent . The plan was favorably listened to , and , on consultation with the managing Trustees of the institution , was immediately adopted . In March of the following year he set sail for Liverpool . With evei*y facility tbr the prosecution of his studies , and with a soul fully awake not only to the opportunities of scientific acquisition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Old World , he passed a year in England and Scotland , and then returned with new energy to his work in the College . From this tune forward , for fifty years , he pursued his even course in the Academic life , speaking to successive classes with an inspiring enthusiasm of the truths and mysteries of Nature , and never failing to point them , in all his instructions , to that infinite Creator whose presence he // had felt , at the beginning , was everywhere manifested in Nature 's works . As a Lecturer upon Science within the College walls , he was , according to the universal testimony of the oldest graduates . a man of rare excellence . With a new subject and a heart full of love for it ,  --  with a most pleasing address and a wonderful command of language , he had the pleasure , which few Professors under our compulsory collegiate system ever enjoy , of seeing all his audiences interested and delighted . fle was enabled to impress upon them truths and facts of which they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vision , as they looked out upn the world around them , that wonders hitherto unseen became familiar to their thought . Their life seemed to them to be enlarged by what they gathered from his instructions , and , as with the joy of a new treasure , they carried away what lie revealed to them , flever t4 forget what they had learned or the teacher from whom they had learned it . The students who listened tG him , during th elast ten or twenty years of his active life , can scarcely imagine the effect produced upon their predecessors in the earlier period ,  - -  for , largely owing to his own efforts , the knowledge of Natural Science lmd , by that time , been so widely spread abroad among the community , that the things once new had become old and well-known , and a portion of the charm had conseqnentl* passed away . But the graduates of the years preceding 1820 no more easily failed to remember what he taught , than did the graduates of the years following 1840 lose from their recollection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work which Professor Silliman did for the College , no adequate estimate can be made . In his own department ,  --  - the field of Natural Scien*e ,  --  the change from the nothingness of the days when he had the memorable interview with President Dwight to the present development and prosperity of the great Scientific School , which forms a vigorous part of the University , though not entirely due to his efforts , may seem a kind of outward representation of what he accomplished . But when we try to measure the influence which he exerted upon individual minds among the students , or the service to the causeof learning here which his constant and faithful lal ) ors in his own chair rendered for so many years , or the power which his presence in its // Faculty gave to the College far and wide , or the aid which his dignified person and eloquent appeals afforded it , when its claims were to be presented before its graduates or the public or the State  --  the most careful searching into the history of the past or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known . We would not compare him , indeed , with the other noble and faithful men who were his fellow-laborers in the instruction and government of the College . They were all admirably qualified for the peculiar sphere and work to which they were called , and , in a remarkable manner , their different powers and tastes answered to and supplemented each other . They were some of them men of greater genius , doubtless , than he was , and more adapted to the severer studies and deeper philosophical investigations . But it is hardly too much to say that , for forty years , he was perhaps the man of widest reputation among them all  --  a reputation which extended through all classes of his own countrymea and even far beyond the boundaries of his native land . Multitudes of persons , doubtless , knew of the existence of Yale College more from the fact that he was in it , than from any other cause , and multitudes more , who had never seen or heard him , had learned from his wide . spread fame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . The many hundreds also of young men-more than two thousand exen-who were educated here during his term of service , mingled with their joyous recollections of New Haven their reverence for him , and to every one among them his presence was a part of their college life . The very celebrity of such a man , when it has all been gained within its borders or in its service , is in itself a treasure of incalculable value to the University where his life is passed . The personal reminiscences which the volumes contain , we regret to say , extend , so far as the College is concerned , only to the history of the growth of his own department They tell the well-known story of the candle box in which lie carried the whole cabinet of minerals belonging to the institution to Philadelphia in 1803 ; and of the first effort at preparing a laboratory , which , being arranged under the direction of the well-disposed , but ( on this subject ) ignorant Trustees , was almost useless until he could prepare it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gibbs collection , at a later day , which , as it was placed on the College grounds , became a center of attraction for both students and strangers , and excited much enthusiasm for the science which it represented . They also set forth the progress of his own work , , as he steadily pursued his labors from year to year , seizing upon every opportunity for new acquisitions , and pressing the claims of all the sciences committed to his care . The development of the College itself in this respect is thus given , in considerable measure , and l ) erliaps as fully as could be expected or desired . We had hoped , however , before the volmimes appeared , that they would contain more than this . It will be remembered that Mr. Silliman 's professorial life covered all the years from the early beginning of Dr. Dwight 's presidency to the close of 1864  --  the entire period since the College began to enlarge itself toward the demands of the present age . Rarely , if ever , has the history of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great public institution , through so many years and so many changes . In looking forward to the publication of the Autobiography , therefore , and in entering upon the perusal of it after it had been published , we could not but anticipate great pleasure in reading much of the history of the College as viewed from the standpoint of his own mind-as traced out by him , when he turned his thought backward over his past career and recalled to his memory his own feelings at the time of past events or his own knowledge of the circumstances that must , of necessity , be unknown to other umen , except from the testimony of those who had gone before . The value and interest of such a per8onctl hi8tory , if we may so call it , of Yale College to every one interested in its progress and welfare can scarcely be overestimated , and we were naturally led to expect that it would be given in this work . But we are sorry to say that nothing of the kind is to be found . From a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from some other reason , he passes over all these details of the past , and we discover hardly anything of what lie had seen and known in the general life of the College , during the fifty years of his continuance in his professorship . Even the change of the presidency of the institution from Dr. Dwight to Dr. Day-one of the most memorable // crises in the whole history of the College-is altogether omitted , and nothing is said of the steady advancement of its interests or the increase of its departments after that time . And so throughout both the volumes , the life of Yale College , as seen through the mind and thought of this venerated officer , is nowhere manifest , as we could have wished . The spirit of faultfinding is not a pleasant spirit , and it is a spirit which one especially might not desire to indulge when within the presence of so genial and kindly a man as Professor Silllinan was . But the expression of regret , we trust , is not unfitting ,  --  regret that his enthusiasm for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a story tbr his own family , or the absorbing influence of other things , or some other cause , kept him from giving out from the storehouse of his memory what would have been of so much worth to hundieds or thousands of his readers . An autobiography , it may be said indeed , is , almost from its very nature , wholly centered upon the man himself , and these volumes make up an autobiography . But , in this case , the life of the individual was so coincident with and intertwined in the life of the College , that whatever the author might have told us , as from his own observation , would have scarcel29 passed the limits of the narrative of himself Our regret , however , is unavailing now , and as we have dwelt upon the point , perchance , too long already , we leave it with these words . It is one of the honors of Professor Sillirnan 's life , that , while the history of his own career can thus be written without giving , with greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of the College , on the other hand , even in the remotest future , can never be written at all , without including the record of his life and work . As we turn aside from this brief consideration of what he did in his special sphere as a college officer , to speak of his service to the cause of science in general , and thus to the world , we feel a peculiar embarrassment in that our own duties in lith have called us into another field . But the especial service which he rendered , as well by reason of the peculiarities of his mental gifts as because of the peculiarities of the time in which his life began , was one that could be appreciated , in a great measure , by all educated and thoughtful men of every // profession . We can allude to it only in a few words . Professor Fisher opens his work by descrihing him as " the most eminent of American teachers of Natural Science . " If we compare him with the most distinguished scientific men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , could not be said of him . The state of scientific knowledge , either in this country or in Europe , did not admit ot his becoming so , nor do we suppose that , even had he commenced his course with the advantages of to-day , he would have taken precisely the same position with some who might easily be named . In another sense , however , the description is a true one . He did so much by his celebrated courses of lectures in the various larger cities of the country , and by his publication of the American Journal of Science , to bring these hitherto unknown branches of learning to the knowledge of the whole people , that everybody became acquainted with his name and fame . Men who would have been , perhaps , altogether unable to appreciate the investigations of many prominent scholars in these departments , at the present day , or who would have passed them by with scarce a thought of their value to the world , felt that Professor Silliman was a great public benefactor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , who could properly estimate everything in the work of others , gave him the peculiar praise which belongs to men who lead the way and are pioneers . All classes , therefore , alike acknowh*dged his services , and he had a reputation , as compared with his contemporaries and his younger associates and followers , if not the highest with some , yet the most universal with all . The American Journal was established in 1818 , and was conducted , in whole or in part , by him for a period of about thirty years . The results accomplished by this single work ,  --  a work , it must be rememnbered , altogether outside of the duties of his official position ,  --  are enough in themselves to have made his life a more than commonly useful one ; and the energy and enthusiasm with which he undertook it and carried it forward , even at times amid many discouragements , show that he was no ordinary man . He had that peculiar power , which is found in those who most help the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessities of the cause in which he was engaged // and of supplying those necessities by his own personal exertions . Not like the mass of educated men , or even of men in trusted with some great public interest-he suffered no moment to pass without considering what might be done when opportunity should offer , and no opportunity of action to escape him when the favorable moment arrived . He was a diligent , thoughtful , earnest , large-minded worker in the beginnings and in the times when all encouragement was only the hope of the future . But just as in the College , so also in the cause of science , if the beginnings are lost to view in what may folloW them , they are no less the evidence of faithful service or of large powers . But we are not left to the views or testimony on this subject of persons like ourselves , outside of the field of natural science . The volumes contain expressions of opinion in regard to his services from some of the most illustrious scientific men now living in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Professor Silliman , on the occasion of a visit to New Haven in 1830 , remarks as follows : " He exercised at that time a wide and commanding influence on the science of the country ; gave dignity to its pursuit ; was the eloquent expounder of its principles , the able adv6cate of its importance , and its defender against the denunciations of zealous , though narrow-minded theologians , and that , too , with an humble and devout acceptance of the essential truths of revelation . " The same gentleman adds , in regard to the Ainerican Journal : " Its establishment and maintenance under restricted pecuniary means was an enterprise which involved an amount of thought and of labor , for the expenditnre of which he has well merited the gratitude not only of his own countrymen but of the world . it has served not only to awaken a taste for science in this country by keeping its readers continually informed of the discoveries in science , wherever it is cultivated , but , above all , it has called into the field of original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has furnished a ready means of presenting the results of their labors to the world , through a medium well suited to insure attention , and to secure proper acknowledginent for originality and priority . Nor are the results which have been thus evoked few or unimportant , since many of them // relate to the objects and phenomena of a vast continent almost* entirely unexplored , in which nature has exhibited some of her operations on a scale of grandeur well calculated to correct the immature deductions from too limited a survey of similar appearances in the Old World . " He also states , in connection with the foregoing remarks , that Professor Silliman , " through his public lectures and by means of the Journal , became more widely known and more highly appreciated than any other man of science in this country . " Professor Jeifries Wyman says , in a letter to the editor of these volumes : " His gifts as a teacher were of such marked excellence , that it is not easy to do justice to them . It may be fairly claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , through his popular lectures no less than his academic courses , to create and foster a love for geology and the physical sciences . The progress due to his beneficent influence can not easily be estimated . The influence he exerted , the progress he stimulated , were the work of his life  --  a great boon to science . " And Professor Josiah P. Cooke , the present distinguished instructor in Harvard College in the chemical department , referring to Professor Silliman 's lectures before the Lowell Institute , in Boston , in 1839-1843 , gives him the praise which would be the most welcome of all rewards to a teacher in any branch of learning . " At those lectures , " he remarks , " I was an attentive listener . Although a mere boy-one of the youngest of those present-I then acquired my taste for the science which has since become the business of my life . " The record given in Mr. Silliman 's diary also  --  a simple narrative , as it is , of the period during which he was lecturing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the numbers of his immense audiences and the interest which they displayed , as well as in the testimony of prominent men in every walk of life , that he did , in those yeam 's , a most remarkable and a most useful work . No one who will review his life can fail to feel that he was , indeed , a remarkable and useful man . But a man 's work , at the best , is only a portion of his life , and there are other portions of it which have more to do with his real self . The two volumes which Professor Fisher has given to the public , and which , as we have seen , are almost // entirely made up of the story told by Mr. Silliman himself , present , when taken together , the characteristics and peculiarities of his nature-his whole inward and outward being-mainly as they were . The attentive reader , who will carefully peruse the whole work from beginning to end , and will weigh the different parts against each other , will gain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man as those were enabled to gain who were acquainted with him for many years , and observed him in his daily course . In his person he was almost the model of manly beauty . The excellent portrait , at the opening of the first volume , will give to those who never saw him a faithful representation of his face as it appeared in his closing years ; and as he was of full stature and commanding presence in every respect , no one could ever meet him without being impressed , or without feeling that nature had given to him , in his physical being , her choicest gifts . The grace and courteousness of his manners were fully equal to the elegance of his person . President Woolsey remarked of him , in his funeral discourse , that he was , among all the men who had lived in New Haven since the beginnizig of this century , by universal consent the most finished gentleman . We think he must have had peculiar natural endowments , or at least capacities , in this respect . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all who knew him in later life , to observe the anxious thoughtfulness of his mind , from his youth onward , in regard to manners . As early as the close of his junior year in college , we find the wish expressed in his diary , that he may be able to " cultivate the heavenly virtue of affability and complacency to all . " And throughout his earlier career the evidence is everywhere manifest , that he made the cultivation of this virtue one of the important things in life , as a means of success as well as of usefulness . The perfection of ease and grace , which characterized him in old age , was the result of this careful self-training . The influence which it gave him over men of every description , and the aid which it afforded in increasing both his efficiency and his fame may , in all probability , have fully justified to his mind all the care and thought that bad been bestowed upon it . Time danger , of course , to which the man of manners  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as largely as Professor Silliinan did , during his whole life , according to the record which he here gives of himself-is that the outward manners will surpass the inward feeling , and that the person who meets such a man , if , indeed , he be a person of penetrating mind , will perceive the art , however perfect it may be . There are men of gracious bearing who say precisely the same gracious things to every one else that they say to ourselves , or precisely the same things to ourselves whenever we meet them ; and we sometimes feel , after long acquaintance with them , that they are not so truly gracions and thoughtful of others as they seem to be . But President Woolsey , who knew Professor Silliman longer and better than almost any one else , adds to his remark concerning his gentlemanly character , that it was true of him , in the highest sense ,  --  that it pertained not to his exterior , but to his soul . This grace of manner was closely connected with the natural kindliness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ordinary dealing with the world , a man of a kind heart . He was thoughtful not only of the interests but of the pleasure of all . He had always a gentle word for childrena sympathizing one for the poor  --  a helpful one for those who were struggling after an education-an encouraging one for his followers in the way of science . He kept in mind the little things which would make the passing days happier for those around him . He made his house the home for strangers of distinction who visited the city or the college , and was a model of hospitality on the most liberal scale . It should be remarked , also , that his kindliness and the constant genial character of his manners were never broken by the anxieties of his own life . He had , in a remarkable degree , the sunny temperament which is so often a blessing to one 's friends as to one 's self . " The heart at leisure from itself " - free from its own burdens , because always satisfied with the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not always capable of giving the deepest sympathy to those who are in trouble or sorrow , is able oftentimes to be even a more cheering presence to them , and to point them , even by means of its own peacefulness , beyond the clouds and the darkness . There // are compensations and balancings in this world in all things ; and we believe that the souls of richest experience and deepest thought are not , in general , the ones whose sunshine abides unchanging , or whose daily life shows always the same beautiful serenity . But the serenity and sunshine are beautiful in themselves . They are divinely-given blessings ; and whether they are more to l ) e desired or more to be praised than any others is a matter of but little moment , when , after the ending of the earthly career , we willingly think only of the kindly gifts which God bestowed upon the now finished life . And Mr. Silliman had these in their largest measure . Nor would it have been a thing to be wondered at , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural disposition had been of a somewhat different character . The providential ordering had made his life to be , through its whole course , one of quiet and easy flow . It had given him every advantage of person , of health , of position , of residence , of success , and of fame . It had surrounded him with an affectionate family , into which death did not enter for more than a generation ; and in his old age , had suffered his mantle of office to fall unon two of his own household circle , who , with their children , lived beside him , and were ready to sustain him when life should fail . It had opened to him , at every step , the most pleasant recollections of the past , the most delightful experiences of the present , and the most precious hopes of the future . It had , in one word , granted him a life which for him was as bright and beautiful as was , to all around him , the death by which it was finished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful beauty of the cloudless evening-how could it be otherwise than it was  --  the kindliness of a serene spirit shining upon all who came withimi its presence or its influence . The friends who knew Professor Silliman intimately in later life will remember , in connection with his kindliness of manner and of heart , how careful he was never to speak evil of any one . He had attained such a position in the world , and was so conscions of it , that he cherished no envy ; and , as for the spirit of detraction , we can imagine nothing that was farther from his soul . But the early diary shows that here also was the // result of careful thought . It is almost amusing to read the repeated admonitions which he gives to himself , during or after his college life , with reference to these faults ; for we should as soon have expected to find Abraham Lincoln reproving himself for a tendency toward dishonesty , or Dr. Dwight fearing that he might be deficient in generosity of soul or largeminded views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his journal his liability to express unfavorable opinions of others . But it was the sensitiv.eness of his mind to these failings , which made him think that he discovered in himself what in reality was not to be seen , just as the noblest souls oftentimes mistake the points , in which they are freest from every fault , for weaknesses against which they ought continuallyto struggle and to pray . Certainly , if the early years did not differ from the later ones , he was in no danger at any time of falling into this evil . On the contrary , he must have been always an example to all men in his kindly judgment of others , and he seems to have had not even the slightest tendency in his nature to speak of the failings in their character or their actions . Closely allied to these things , which have been mentioned in respect to his feelings toward other men , was his regard for their favorable opinion of himself . It was not altogether unnatural , and perhaps not altogether unfitting , that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire as freely to receive . We leave Professor Fisher , however , to describe his revered friend in his own language . " The love of esteem , " he remarks , " was an evident trait of Mr. Silhiman . It was manifested from early life . Every reader of these volumes will notice the satisfaction he took in the appreciation accorded to his labors , and in his extending fame . It would be a grave error , however , to conclude that he had a sensibility to admiration , which amounted to a weakness . He had too much self-respect to turn out of his path to seek applause ; and the desire of esteem was not the mainspring of his exertions . On the contrary , he was as frank as he was courteous , in avowing his opinions to those who differed from him , and he would instantly risk or sacrifice his popularity rather than desert a principle . While he was thus established in his integrity , he neither felt nor // affected a cynical indifference to the favorable opinion of his fellow-men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him , was more apparent in his case , than in that of men who are less apt to expose their feelings . " The true glory and beauty of a man 's character , however , are seen in the circle of his own friends and his own household , and the highest praise of Professor Sillimnan consists in this , that those who were nearest to him speak in terms only of admiration and respect . The Rev. George Jones , who was a connection of his by marriage , as well as a most familiar acquaintance , says , that " during an intimacy extending over thirty-seven years , having seen him in all situations and under all circumstances , domestic and public ,  --  when honored and applauded , or in the midst of trials , " - he believes , " in all this intercourse , he had never known him do a wrong act , or say a wrong word , or , as far as he could judge , think a wrong thought . " And he adds : - " Perhaps some would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who knew him well will believe that there is no extravagance in the remark . " The letters which are given , at the close of the second volume , from his daughters show , also , that he gained the reverence of his own children , and that he was , beyond most men , a loving and affectionate and wise father . As for friends , on the other hand , he had them everywhere-so many that his prayer for them , when he attended the service at the College Chapel , every Saturday evening , has lingered in our remembrance for twenty years , **while we can scarcely believe that he had a personal enemy in the world . Full of the honors and rewards of a most successful career , he passed through life alike unenvying and unenvied , and passed away from life , at the end , with a universal rejoicing in all that had been or was to be his . He surely had a happy destiny . But no more true is this , than it is that * The prayer above alluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s command of words and comprehensiveness of expression , as well as so clear an indication of the large number of those who were interested in him , and in whom he was interested , that we can not forbear to insert it here . It was a petition for " our friends , wherever they are , spread over this our wide land , or perchance in other lands and beyond the seas , whether connected with us by the ties of nature , alliance , consanguinity , affection , gratitude , or grace . " // his character must have been a most uncommon one in its qualities and in its harmony , to have fitted him for this destiny with such completeness . In his moral character , Professor Sillitnan was marked by his strict adherence to principle . iNothing that was wrong and nothing , even , that violated the highest sense of honor was passed by him without rebuke . It seemed to us sometimes , in our acquaintance with him , that he was so elevated , in this latter respect , as to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard was far lower than his own , and who could not , therefore , be trusted , as he well knew , from his own experience , that he could be himself . The deep feeling of the injustice of American Slavery was tke natural outgrowth of these sentiments , which lay at the very foundation of his being , and we gladly record on these pages what appeared so clearly in his life and now appears so clearly in the story of it  --  the steadiness and earnestness of his opposition to this enormous sin through the whole of his long career . No mingling with Southern society-no honors received from Southern men-could ever blind him to the evil of Southern institutions , or save them from the indignant abhorrence of his soul . The country , in every part , became acquainted with his position on this subject and with his manly defense of it , during the great conflict in Kansas ; and afterward , during the still greater conflict of which that was the immediate precursor , lie was recognized as an earnest , enthusiastic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College has had a glorious record in all the progress of this long warfare , which has extended over more than forty years , since the great Missouri Cornpromise first betrayed the cause of freedom to its enemies . It has never failed to declare itself openly for human rights , no matter who might oppose or who might threaten . And when the outrages of more recent times began to astonish the world , it raised its voice , in tones that could not be mistakemi , and bore continual witness for the truth even to the triumphant result . The words and principles of the illustrious man , who called Mr. Silliman and his associates to their places in the College -- as he declared , that " nothing but the influence of some commanding moral duty would ever induce him to live in a region // where slavery was established " - doubtless sank into the minds of these illustrious pupils , and in their lives was perpetuated the earnest opposition to the wrongs of the system , which he had always felt in his own soul . These honored men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the work to their successors , unfinished , indeed , but ever growing more hopeful and more full of promise . They laid down their armor , one after another , at the end , believing in God and His cause with a joyful faith . And , to-day , we bless their memory for all that they did in the great work , and for all the inspiration they gave to us who have followed them ; while we bless God that we have never lost the inspiration of their example , and that we can now rejoice in the results alike of their prayers and labors and of ours . The peace of to-day  --  the harmony and prosperity of the future-are the glory of those who contended for the right in every torni and every place . And , in no small measure , they are the enduring glory of Yale College . The honored man , whose life we are retraciug now , passed away almost as the last one of his own company , and almost at the closing moment of the struggle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to rejoice with those noble spirits who had gone before him to the reward of their faithful service , and to see only the more clearly than is possible to our human vision the great things that God has reserved for the future generations . In the Christian life , perhaps the most prominent trait in Mr. Silliinan 's charater was his sincere and childlike trust in God . The mysteries of nature and of science , as they opened themselves more and more to his mind , only revealed more and more fully the wonders of the Divine power , and gave their unceasing testimony to the greatness of the Divine love . The still greater mysteries of the plan of salvation , made known in the Bible , assumed to his thought their own higher place , above all that the human intellect was able to attain , while they awakened his perfect confidence in Jesus as the Son of God , and as a Redeemer able to deliver his soul from all the dangers of the future . Life thus became to him a time of fitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parts of the Divine kingdom , for the fullness of a more perfect life that was awaiting him in Heaven . This work of preparation was , indeed , // committed to his own hands , yet it was never lost sight of ; for a moment , by the Being who had given it to him to do . As a child , he seems to have always felt that he was in the presence and under the care of an infinite Father ; and so he turned for help to this Father , without a doubt or fear rising in his mind , l*ut rather with an unhesitating reliance upon His faithfulness . With a simplicity too , that was no less pnculiar than it was charmino* he traced every event and every blessing to the providential *and , and was full of thankfulness to God as well for the smallest as the greatest gifts that came to him with the passing days . And at the end , as he had lived through all the long years of his earthly pilgrimage , believing in the nearness of God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , into that world with the same restful faith , that lie would find there the immediate presence of God with him forever , lie was most truly one of those who become as little children , and thus enter into the blessed kingdom . The review thus presented of the life and character of this distinguished officer of Yale College is an imperfect one , as we are fully aware . There were many things in his work of which we have been unable to speak , and many of our own impressions of him as a man could not be added without extending our Article beyond its proper limits . He was , also , so well known in New Haven , and to multitudes of persons elsewhere , that it has seemed to be almost nnnecessary to describe him to our readers ; while , if any description at all were needed , we have not been able to forget , that it has already been given by those who were more qualified for the work than ourselves . If we have only succeeded in calling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admirers a pleasing thought of him as he was , and in leading them to peruse his own story of his own career , we have done all that we proposed to ourselves at the outset . There are two great classes of men in the worldboth alike indispensable to its progress and welfare , and both alike worthy of all honor ; - those who , in the language of another , are " rather objective than subjective " in their life , and those who are rather the latter than the former . To the former of these two classes Mr. Silliman belonged , and he was one of the most perfect and complete men to be found within it . // He did a great service to mankind , the influence of which will not be lost in the future generations . He filled out his life to the fullness of outward blessings , and all who knew him were thankful , at the end , for the beautiful vision of so long and so happy a career . Surely it was the Divine ordering . Had he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his earlier years , he might have been a man of success in his profession , perchance , or even have risen to the dignity of office . He might have don* a good work in his life , and have been honored and lamented at his death . But who can doubt that his fame would have been less widely extended than it now is , or that his usefulness would have been confined within far narrower limits ? Fortunate in that his mature life began just at the moment of " golden op* ) ortunity , " he was equally fortunate in that a power beyond his own opened to him , at that moment , the academic field , and directed his thoughts and labors into the peaceful ways ot science . No less fortunate was the countr , y also , for the thousands of scientific men , who are now rendering such valuable service to the world , seem but as the followers of that light which he kindled , and successors in that priesthood of which he was the founder . The hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two friends  --  the elder and the younger-met under the beautiful elms , on that summer afternoon , more than sixty years ago , and talked together over the coming time , which they could only believe in and hope for , but could not see . Could the elder of those two friends have had the clear vision of the future , as we now behold it , the joy of his soul would have been a full reward for all his labors . But it was the happy lot of the younger to pass far onward into the then hidden years , and to realize , in his own life and experience , more than either of them had ever imagined . As we stand at the close , as it were , of the career of that generation , and remember what they were , our confidence grows strong within us ; for ii God so wonderfully watched over and provided for the institution , that tie had planted here a century before , as it was entering on a new era of its existence , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it to accomplish in the world , and that He will watch over it with the same kindly care even to // the remotest future . The names of the dead  --  the lives of those who have gone before us-seem as the pledge of the Divine favor , and give us the assurance of our brightest hopes . We can not close without expressing our appreciation of Professor Fisher 's work in preparing these volumes . He has made an excellent use of the large amount of material furnished to him , and deserves the thanks of Mr. Silliman 's nearest friends for the careful manner in which lie has discharged his duty . Few persons who have not attempted such a work themselves , or have not seen such a mass of correspondence and papers of various kinds , as must be thoroughly examined and arranged in order to the accomplishmeut of it , can form any adequate idea of what the biographer has to do . The mere stories of men 's lives , such as those which were fornierly published-descriptions of them by another person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written , as they were less valuable than the modern Memoir . They involved , indeed , more of the biographer 's own authorship , bat far less of skill and wise judgment . If we are to make a person reveal himself to the world , we must patiently search out all that he has left behind as memorials of his inner as well as his outer life  --  and though the careless or thoughtless reader may fail to see what the labor has been , the one who is really appreciative will understand that the author has been most truly laborious where he most perfectly hides himself from view . Professor Fisher 's effort has been not to give his own estimation of his honored friend , but to present that friend to his readers in the expression of his thoughts and sentimnents as they were in all the scenes of his life ; and so faithfully has he pictured him , iii this way , before our minds , that we read the pages of the biography with almost the same feeling with which we used to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were , of the editor of an autobiography , he has rendered a service of higher value to those who would know Professor Silliman 's whole character , than he could have done if he had drawn but little from the manuscripts which lie left . The limits of the volumes , or the private character of the material , have compelled the biographer , as it is , to omit // very much which might , doubtless , have had a peculiar interest , if it could have been published , but enough is given to accomplish the design of the work . The book is essentially , as we have said , an autobiography  --  the very thing that we should especially have desired in the case of such a man . We can not doubt that multitudes of the graduates of Yale , and others who knew him in life , will read his simple story of himself with kindly memories and a warm affection .
