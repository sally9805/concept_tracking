THE MEXICANS AND THEIR COUNTRY . ON the 21st of December , 1859 , General Miramon , at the head of the forces of the Mexican Republic , met an army of Liberals at Colima , and overthrew it . The first accounts of the action represented the victory of the Conservatives to be complete , and as settling the fate of Mexico for the present , as between the parties headed respectively by Juarez and Miramon . Later accounts show that there was some exaggeration as to the details of the action , but the defeat of the Liberals is not denied . It would be rash to attach great importance to any Mexican battle ; but the Liberal cause was so depressed before the action at Colima as ' to create the impression that it could not survive the result of that day . Whether the cause of which Miramon is the champion be popular in Mexico or the reverse , it is certain that at the close of 1859 that chief had succeeded in every undertaking in which he had personally engaged ; and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a successful military man is sure to be a popular chieg whatever may be his opinions , to allow of our doubting the effect of victory on the minds of the Mexicans . The mere circumstance that Miramon is personally victorious , while the Liberals achieve occasional successes over their foes where he is not present , will be of much service to him . That " there is nothing so successful as success** is an idea as old as the day on which the Tempter of Man caused him to lose Paradise , and to the world 's admission of it is to be attributed the decision of nearly every political contest which has distracted society . Miramon may have entered upon a career not unlike to that of Santa Afia , whose early victories enabled him to maintain his hold on the respect of his countrymen long after it should have been lost through his cruelties and his disregard of his word and his oath . All , indeed , that is necessary to complete the power of Miramon is , that some foreign nation should interfere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if made on a sufficiently large scale , might lead to his defeat and banishment , but it wbuld cause him to reign in the hearts of the Mexicans ; and he would be recalled , as we have seen Santa Afia recalled , as soon as circumstances should enable the people to act according to their own sense of right . Before considering the probable effect of Miramon 's success on the policy of the United States toward Mexico , there is one point that deserves some attention . Which party , the Liberal or the Conservative , is possessed of most power in Mexico ? The assertions made on this subject are of a very contradictory character . President Buchanan , in his last Annual Message , says that the Constitutional government - meaning that of which Juarez is the head - " is supported by a large majority of the people and the States , but there are important parts of the country where it can enforce no obedience . General Miramon maintains himself at the capital , and in some of the distant provinces there are military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . " On the other hand , a Mexican writer , a member of the Conservative party , who published his views on the condition of his country just one month before the President 's Message appeared , declares that the five Provinces or States in which the authority of Miramon was then acknowledged contain a larger population than exists in the twenty-three States in which it was not acknowledged . Of the local authorities in these latter States he says , - " It is a great mistake to imagine that they obey the government of Juarez any more than they obey the government of General Miramon , or any further than it suits their own private interest to obey him . It would be curious to know , for instance , how much of the money collected // by these local authorities ' for taxes , or contributions , or forced loans , and chiefly at the seaport towns for custombouse duties , goes to the national treasury ' under the Juarez government . " In this case , as in many others of a like nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of the people feel much interest in the contest , while most of them are prepared to obey whichever chief shall succeed in it without foreign aid . Of the active men of the country , the majority are now with Miramon , or Juarez would not be shut up in a seaport , with his party forming the mere sea-coast fringe of the nation . All that is necessary to convert him into a national , patriotic ruler is , that a foreign army should be sent to the assistance of his rival ; and that such assistance shall be sent to Juarez , President Buchanan has virtually pledged the United States by his words and his actions . In his last Message to Congress , President Buchanan dwells with much unction upon the wrongs we have experienced from Mexico , and avers that we can obtain no redress from the Miramon government . " We may in vain apply to the Constitutional government at Vera Cruz , " he says , " although it is well disposed to do us justice , for adequate redress . Whilst its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea-coasts of the Republic , its power does not extend to the city of Mexico and the States in its vicinity , where nearly all the recent outrages have been committed on American citizens . We must penetrate into the interior before we can reach the offenders , and this can only be done by passing through the territory in the occupation of the Constitutional government . The most acceptable and least difficult mode of accomplishing the object will be to act in concert with that government . " He then recommends that Congress should authorize him " to employ a sufficient military force to enter Mexico for the purpose of obtaining indemnity for the past and security for the future . " And he expresses the opinion that justice would be done by the Constitutional government ; but his faith is not quite so strong as we could wish it to be , as he carefully adds , " This might be secured in advance by a preliminary treaty . " Thus has the President pledged the country to help Juarez establish his authority over Mexico , in words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His actions have been quite as much to the purpose . He placed himself in communication with Juarez in 1859 , and recognized his government to be the only existing government of Mexico as early as April 7th , through our envoy , Mr. McLane . That envoy floats about , having a man-of-war for his home , and ready , it should seem , to receive the government to which he is accredited , in the event of its being forced to make a second sea-trip for the preservation of the lives of its members . As the sole refuge for unpopular European monarchs , at one time , was a British man-of-war , so are feeble Mexican chiefs now compelled to rely for safety upon our national ships . To predict anything respecting Mexican affairs would be almost as idle as it would be to assume the part of a prophet concerning American politics ; but , unless Miramon 's good genius should leave him , his appearance in Vera Cruz may be looked for at no very distant day , and then we shall have the Juarez @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglect , as may be dictated by the exigencies of our affairs . That base of operations , upon the possession of which President Buchanan has so confidently calculated , would be lost , and could be regained only as the consequence of action as comprehensive and as costly as that which placed Vera Cruz in the bands of General Scott in 1847 . If the policy laid down by President Buchanan should be adopted and pursued , war would follow between the United States and Mexico from the triumph of Miramon ; and in that war , we should be a principal , and not the mere ally of one of those parties into which the Mexican // people are divided . Logically , war is inevitable from Mr. Buchanan 's arguments and General Miramon 's victories ; but , as circumstances , not logic , govern the actions of politicians , we may possibly behold all Mexico loyal to the young general , and yet not see an American army enter that country . The President declares that in Mexico 's " fate and in her fortune , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have a far deeper interest , socially , commercially , and politically , than any other nation . " The truth of this will not be disputed ; but suppose that Miramon should establish and maintain a settled government in Mexico , would it not be our duty , and in accordance " with our wise and settled policy , " to acknowledge that government , and to seek from it redress of those wrongs concerning which Mr. Buchanan speaks with so much emphasis ? Once in a responsible position , and desirous of having the world 's approval of his countrymen 's conduct , Miramon might he even more than willing to promise as much as Juarez has already promised , we may presume , in the way of satisfaction . That he would fulfil his promises , or that Juarez would fulfil those which he has made , it would be too much to assert as neither of them would be able , judging from Mexico 's past , to maintain himself long in power . For the present , if not forever , Juarez may be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ramon , though his prospects are apparently fair , the intelligent observer of Mexican politics can not fail to have seen that the glare of the clerical eye is upon him , and that some faint indications on his part of a determination not to be the Church 's vassal have already placed his supremacy in peril , and perhaps have caused conspiracies to be formed against him which shall prove more injurious to his fortunes than the operations of Liberal armies or the Messages of American Presidents . The Mexican Church , full-blooded and wealthy as it is , is the skeleton in the palace of every Mexican chief that spoils his sleep and threatens to destroy his power , as it has destroyed that of every one of his predecessors . The armies and banners of the Americans of the North can not be half so terrible to Miramon supposing him to be a reflecting man , as are the vestments of his clerical allies . Even those armies , too , may be called into Mexico by the Church , and those banners become the standards of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the world has ever seen is the least given to religious intolerance , and to whom the mere thought of an established religion is odious . Nor would there be anything strange in such a solution of the Mexican question , if we are to infer the character of the future from the character of the past and the present . A generation that has seen American democracy become the propagandists of slavery assuredly ought not to be astonished at the spectacle of American Protestantism upholding the State religion of Mexico , and that religion embodying the worst abuses of the system of Rome . It was , perhaps , because he foresaw the possibility of this , that " the grayeyed man of destiny , " William Walker himself , was reconciled last year to the ancient Church , and received into her bosom . As a Catholic , and as a convert to that faith from heresy , he might achieve those victories for which he longs , but which singularly avoid him as a man of the sword . It is the old story : Satan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is heart-sickness in this instance the hope of being able to plunder some weak , but wealthy country having been too long deferred for the patience even of an agent of Fate . That our government means to perse-. vere in its designs against Mexico , in spite of the misfortunes of the Liberals , is to be inferred from all that we hear from Washington . The victories of Oajaca , Queretaro , and Colima , won by the Conservatives , have wrought no apparent change in the Presidential mind . So anxious , indeed , is Mr. Buchanan for the triumpli of his plan , that he is ready to seek // aid from his political opponents . Leading Republicans are to be consulted personally , and they are to be appealed to and asked patriotically to banish all party and " sectional " feelin , , s from their minds , while discussing the test mode of helping " our neighbor " out of the Slough of Despond , so that she may be enabled to meet the demands we have upon her ,  - -  not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose giving her a round sum , but in land , of which she has a vast supply , and all of it susceptible of yielding good returns to servile industry . There is a necessity for this appeal to Opposition Senators , as the Juarez treaty can not be ratified without the aid of some of their number . The ratification vote must consist of two-thirds of the Senators present and voting ; and of the sixty-six men forming the Senate , but thirty-nine are Democrats , and two are " South Americans . " The Republicans , who could muster but a dozen votes in the Senate when the present phase of the Slavery contest was begun , have doubled their strength , and have arrived at the honor of being sought by men who but yesterday regarded them as objects of scorn . Nor is it altogether a new thing for the administration to depend upon its enemies ; and the practical adoption of the " one-term " principle in our Presidential coi*tests , by virtually depriving all administrations of strict party support , has introduced into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are beginning to be seen , but which is destined to have grave effects , and not such , in all cases , as are to be desired . But it is not from the ambition or the perverseness of the President that Mexico has much to fear . Were it not for other reasons , which proceed from the " Manifest Destiny " school , the country would laugh down the administration 's Mexican programme , and it could hardly be expected to receive the grave consideration of the Senate . What Mexico has to fear is the rapid increase of the old American opinion , that we were appointed by Destiny to devour her , and that in spoiling her we are only fulfilling " our mission , " discharging , as we may say , a high moral and religious duty . It is not that we have any animosity toward Mexico , but that we are the Heaven-appointed rulers of America , of which she happens to be no small part . By a happy ordination , and a wise direction of our skill as missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on strong countries ; and as wolves do not seek to make meals of lions , preferring mutton , so we have no t&amp;ste for those very American countries which are inhabited by the English race , and in which exist those great political institutions of the enjoyment of which we are so proud . The obligation to take Mexico is admitted by most Americans , though some would proceed more rapidly in the work of acquisition than others ; but no one hints that we ought to have Canada . Our government has repeatedly offered to purchase Cuba of Spain , which offer that country holds to be an insult ; but it has not yet thought proper to seek possession of Jamaica . Destiny , in our case , is as judicious as it is imperative , and means that we shall find our account in doing her work . Had she favored some other nations as much as we are favored , they might have flourished till now , instead of becoming wrecks on the sandy shores of the Sea of Time . The conviction that Mexico is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as old , almost , as the American nation . We found Spain in our path very soon after she had behaved in so friendly a manner to us during the Revolution ; and one of the earliest thoughts of the West was to get her out of the way . This was " inevitable , " and " Manifest Destiny " was as actively at work in the days of Rodgers Clarke as in those of Walker , but with better reason ; for the control that Spain exercised over the navigation of the Mississippi was contrary to common sense . in a few years , the acquisition of Louisiana ( nominally from France , but really from Spain ) removed the evil of which the West complained ; but the idea of seizure remained , and was strengthened by // the deed that was meant to extinguish it . That Louisiana had been obtained without the loss of a life , and for a sum of money that could be made to sound big only when reduced to francs , was quite enough to cause the continuance of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means so small . Enmity to Spain remained , after the immediate cause of it had ceased to exist . War with that country was expected in 1806 , and the West anxiously desired it , meaning to invade Mexico . Hence the popularity of Aaron Burr in that part of the Union , and the favor with which his schemes were regarded by Western men . Burr was a generation in advance of his Atlantic contemporaries , but he was not in advance of the Ultramontanes , only abreast of them , and well adapted to be their leader , from his military skill and his high political rank ; for his duel with Hamilton had not injured him in their estimation . His connection with the war party , however , proved fatal to it , and probably was the cause of the non-realization of its plans fifty years ago . President Jefferson hated Colonel Burr with all the intensity that philosophy can give to political rivalry ; and so the whole force of the national government was brought to bear against the arch-plotter , who fell with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then came Napoleon 's attack on Spain , which necessarily postponed all attempts on countries that might become subject to him ; and before the Peninsular War had been decided , we were ourselves involved in war with England , which gave us work enough at home , without troubling " our neighbor . " But the events of that war helped to increase the spirit of acquisition in the South and the Southwest , while they put an end forever to plans for the conquest of Canada . The " aid and comfort " which the Spaniards afforded to both Indians and Britons , from Florida , led to the seizure of Florida by our forces in time of peace with Spain , and to the purchase of that country . The same year that saw our title to Florida perfected saw the end of Spanish rule in Mexico . The first effect of this change was unfavorable to the extension of American dominion . Mexico became a republic , taking the United States for a model . Principle and vanity alike dictated forbearance on our side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm regard by the American people ; and had her experiment proved successful , our territory never could have been increased at her expense . But that experiment proved a total failure . Not even France herself could have done worse for republicanism than was done by Mexico . Internal wars , constant political changes , violations of faith , and utter disregard of the terms of the Constitution ,  --  these things brought Mexico into contempt , and revived the idea that North America had been especially created for the use of the Anglo-Saxon race and the abuse of negroes . As a nation , too , Mexico had been guilty of many acts of violence toward the United States , which furnished themes for those politicians who were interested in bringing on a war between the two countries . The attempt to enforce Centralism on Texas , which contained many Americans , increased the ill-will toward Mexico . The end came in 1846 , when we made war on that country , a war resulting in the acquisition of much Mexican territory ,  - -  Texas , Upper California , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illiberally in our treatment of Mexico , the position of the parties considered ; for we might have taken twice as much of her land as we did take , and not have paid her a farthing : and we paid her $15,000,000 , besides assuming the claims which Americans held against her , amounting to $3,250,000 more . The war " blooded " the American people , and made the idea of acquiring Mexico a national one ; whereas before it had a sectional character . The question of absorbing that country was held to be merely one of time ; and had it not been fo ; the existence of slavery , much more of Mexico would have been acquired ere now , either by purchase or by war . There have // been few men at the head of Mexican affairs , since the peace of 1848 , who were not ready to sell us any portion of their country to which we might have laid claim , if we had tendered them the choice between our purse and our sword . We paid $10,000,000 for the Mesilla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river and the Gulf of California ,  - -  a circumstance that shows how resolute is our determination to have Mexico , and also that we are not disposed to have the process of acquisition marked by shabby details . The law that governs the course of conquest is of a plain and obvious character . Occasionally there may arise some conqueror , like Timour , who shall sweep over countries apparently for no other purpose but to play the part of the destroying angel , though it is not difficult to see that even such a man has his uses in the orderings of Providence for the government of the world . But the rule is , that conquest shall , quite as much as commerce , be a gainful business . Conquerors who proceed systematically go from bad lands to good lands , and from good lands to better ones . To get out of the desert into a land flowing with milk and honey is as much the object of modern and uncalled Gentiles as ever it was with ancient calied and chosen Jews . Historians appear inclined to censure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and fertile , he sought to conquer the poor Scythians , who conquered him . The Romans organized robbery , and had a wonderful skill in selecting peoples for enemies who were worth robbing . " The Brood of Winter , " who overthrew the Roman Empire , poured down upon lands where grew the grape and the rose . The Saracens , who were carried forward , in the first instance , by fanaticism , had the streams of their conquests lengthened and broadened and deepened by the wealth and weakness of Greeks and Persians and Goths and Africans . Had those streams poured into deserts , by the deserts they would soon have been absorbed , and we should have known the Mahome April , tan superstition only as we know twenty others of those forms of faith produced by the East , - as something sudden , strange , and short-lived . But it was fed by the riches which its votaries gained , the reward of their piety , and the cement of their religious edifice . The iNormans , that most chivalrous of races , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen love of gain , did not seize upon poor countries , but upon the best lands they could take and hold ,  --  the beautiful Neustria , the opulent Sicily , and the fertile England , so admirably situated to become the seat of empire . So , it will be found , have all conquering , absorbing races proceeded , not even excluding the Pilgrim Fathers , who , if they paid the Indians for their lands , gencrally contrived to get good measure for small disbursements , and to order things so that the lands purchased should be fat and fair in saintly eyes . Tried by the standard of conquest , the course of the American people toward Mexico is the most natural in the world . Mexico possesscs immense wealth , and incalculable capabilities in the way of increasing that wealth and she is no more competent to defend herself against a powerful neighbor than Sicily was to maintain her independence against the Romans . We are her neighbor , with a population abounding in adventurers domestic and imported , and with politicians who carve out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and perhaps even presidents . As we get nearer to Mexico , the population is more lawless , less inclined to observe those rules upon faith in which the weak must depend for existence . The eagles are gathered about the carcass , and think that to forbid its division among them would be to perpetrate a great moral wrong . The climate of Mexico seems to invite the Northern adventurer to that country . " In general , " says Mr. Butterfield , ( who has just publisbcd a volume that might be called " The American Conqueror 's Guide-Book in Mexico , " and to which we take this occasion to express // our obligations , ) - " in general , the Republic , with the exception of the coast and a few other places , which from situation are extremely hot , enjoys an even and temperate climate , free from the extremes of heat and cold , in consequence of which the most of the hills in the cold regions are covered with trees , which never lose their foliage , and often remind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Tierra Caliente we are struck by the groves of mimosas , liquid amber , palms , and other gigantic plants characteristic of tropical vegetation ; and finally , in Tierra Templada , by the enormous haciendas , many of which are of such extent as to be lost to the sight in the horizon with which they blend . " This picture is calculated to incite the armed apostles of American liberty , and to render them impatient until they shall have carried the blessings of civilization to Mexico , rewarding themselves for their active benevolence by the appropriation of lands so admirably adapted to the labors of the descendants of Ham , whom it would be impious in them to leave unprovided with the best fields to work out their mission ,  --  which is , to produce the greatest possible crops with the least possible expenditure of capital and care , for the good of that superior race which kindly supplies the deficiencies of Heaven with respect to Africa ,  - -  a second Providence , as it were , and slightly tinged with selfishness . We need not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind . We find them at work in fixing the future of Mexico . The final cause of the absorption of Mexico by the United States will be the restless appropriating spirit of our people ; but this might leave her a generation more of national life , were it not that her territory presents a splendid field for slavelabor , and that , both from pecuniary and from political motives , our slaveholders are seeking the increase of the number of Servile States . Mexico is capable of producing an unlimited amount of sugar and an enormous amount of cotton . There is a demand for both these articles ,  --  a demand that is constantly increasing , and which is so great , and grows so rapidly , that the melancholy prospect of rum without sugar has presented itself to some minds , not to speak of only half-allowance to all the tea-tables of Christendom . Africa is beginning to wear shirts , and the stamp of more than one Yankee manufacturer has been indorsed on the backs of many African chiefs . Slavelabor , we are assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar for none but negroes can labor on the plantations where cane and cotton are raised , and they will labor only under compulsion , and compulsion can be had only under the system of slavery . The point seems to be as clearly established as reason can establish it , though the negroes might object to the process adopted and to the conclusion drawn ; but they are interested parties , and not to be regarded therefore . We must add , that the quality of Mexican sugar is as good as the yield is enormous , and , were the cane-fields in our hands , it wotild be impious to doubt of there being a fall of a mill on the pound all the world over . Compared with such a gain to the consuming classes , what would it matter that the producers were " expended " every four or five years , thereby furnishing an argument in favor of the revival ( we should say extension , for it appears to be lively enough ) of the slave-trade between Africa and America ? So is it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised annually from the seed , as in our cotton-growing States . In the Hot Land of Mexico , the laborers in the cottonfields merely keep these fields clear from weeds , as we should say ,  --  no easy task , it may be assumed , with a soil so luxuriant , and where frost is unknown . Yet the amount of cotton produced annually in the Hot Land is shamefully small , not exceeding ten million pounds ,  --  a mere bagatelle , which Manchester would devour in a week . Consider what an increase in cottons and calicoes , what a gain in shirts and sheets , would follow from the seizure // of those fields by Americans from Mississippi and Alabama ; and let no idle notions concerning national morality prevent the increase of those comforts which the poor now know , but which never came to the knowledge of C*esar Augustus , and which were unknown to Solomon in all his glory . Where would have been the great English nation , if the adventurous cut-throats who followed Norman William from Saint Valery to Hastings had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sax-ons ? There are other articles , besides cotton and sugar , in the production of which slave-lahor pays , and pays well , too ; and all these articles Mexico is capable of yielding immensely . The world needs more rice ; rice can be cultivated only by negroes , or people much like them ; and rice can he raised in Mexico In incredible quantities , under a judicious system of industry , such as , we are constantly assured , slavery ever has been and ever will be . Tobacco is another Mexican article , and also one in producing which negroes can be profitably employed ; and as tobacco is becoming scarce , while consumers of it are on the increase , it would seem to be our duty to prepare the fields of Tabasco for more extended cultivation , - since there , as well as in many other parts of Mexico , tobacco almost as good as the best that is grown in Cuba can be produced . Coffee , indigo , and hemp are Mexican articles , and can all be cultivated by slave-labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yielding three hundred fold in the Hot Land , and twice that rate in one district ; and maize is a slave-grown article . Smaller articles there are , but valuable , in raising which slaves would be found useful , - among them cocoa , vanilla , and fr*joles , the last being to the Mexicans what the potato is to the Irish , the common food of the common people . On the supposition that slaves could be made to labor well in wheat-fields ,  --  and under a stringent system of slavery this would be far from impossible , - Mexico might afford profit . able employment to myriads of Africans in the course of civilization and Christianization . Wheat returns sixty for one in the best valleys of the Temperate Region ; and when we call to mind that flour is becoming a luxury to poor white people even in America , the propriety of having those valleys filled up with a black population of great industrial capability stands admitted ; and as black peopie have an unaccountable aversion to working for others , the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the capacity of the white races for consuming tivice as much as is now produced in the whole world . It would be no difficult matter to show that Mexico is the most productive of countries , whether we consider the variety of the articles there grown , or the capabilities of the land for increasing their quantity . To the manufacturer and the merchant she is as attractive as she is to the agriculturist ; and her mineral wealth is apparently inexhaustible , and has passed into a proverb . During the thirteen generations since the Spanish Conquest , the value of the gold and silver exported is estimated at $4,640,204,889 ; and this is considered a very low estimate by those best qualified to judge of its correctness . Mr. Butterfield expresses the opinion that the annual export is now near $40,000,000 , much of which is smuggled out of the country . The land is also rich in the common metals , the production of which , as well as of gold and silver , would be incalculably increased , should Mexico pass under the dominion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth , if not profuse of its own . We have said enough to show the capabilities of Mexico as a slaveholding country ; and of the desire of American slaveholders to push their industrial system into countries adapted to it , there are , unfortunately , but too many proofs . They are prompted by the love of power and the love of wealth to obtain possession of Mexico , and the energy that is ever displayed by them when pursuing a favorite object will not allow us to doubt I // what the end of the contest upon which the United States are about to enter must be . We have then , to consider the character of the people upon whom slavery is to be forced , and the probable effect of their subjugation to American dominion . The subject is far from being agreeable , and the consideration of it gives rise to the most painful thoughts that can move the mind . The exact number of people in Mexico it is not possible to state . Mr. Mayer estimated that in 1850 the proximate actual population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Indians , 4 ,  - -  854,886 ; Mestizos , Zambos , Mulattoes , etc. , 2,165,345 ; Negroes , 6,600 . Only one-seventh of the population belongs to that class , or caste , to which , according to the common sentiment in the United States , dominion over the earth has been given . The other six-sevenths are , in American estimation , and would so become in fact , should Mexico own our rule , mere political Pariahs ; and if they should escape personal slavery , it would be through their rapid extinction under the blasting effects of civilization . There are , at this time , it may be assumed , 7 ,  - -  000,000 human beings in Mexico to whom few Americans are capable of conceding the full rights of humanity . Of these , about one-third , the negroes and the mixed races , from the fact that they have African blood in their veins , would be outlawed by the mere conquest of Mexico by American arms , so far as relates to the higher conditions of life . As several of our States have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banishment , and as the American settlers of Mexico would proceed principally from States in which the sentiment prevails that has led to the adoption of so illiberal a policy , a third of the native population would , it is likely , be reduced to a condition of chattel slavery within a very short time after the change of government had been effected . There is not an argument used in behalf of the rigid slave codes of several . of our States which would not be applicable to the enslavement of the black and mixed Mexicans , all of whom would be of darker skins and less enlightened minds than the slaves that would be taken to the conquered land by the conquerors . How could the slaves thus taken there be allowed to see even their inferiors in the enjoyment of personal freedom ? If the State of Arkansas can condescend to be afraid of a few hundred free negroes and mulattoes , and can illustrate its fear by turning them out of their homes in midwinter , what might not be expected from a ruling caste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions of colored people to strike terror into the souls of those comprising it ? Just or humane legislation could not be looked for at the hands of such men , who would be guilty of that cruelty which is born of injustice and terror . The white race of Mexico would join with the intrusive race to oppress the mixed races ; and as the latter would be compelled to submit to the iron pressure that would be brought to bear upon them , more than two millions of slaves would be added to the servile population of America , and would become the basis of a score of Representatives in the national legislature , and of as many Presidential Electors ; so that the practice of the grossest tyranny would give to the Slaveholdin* , States , per saltum , as great an increase of political power as the Free States could expect to achieve through a long term of years illustrated by care and toil and the most liberal expenditure of capital . The Indians would fare no better than the mixed races , though the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward the latter . The Indians of Mexico are a race quite different from the Indians whom we have exterminated or driven to the remote West . They are a sad , a superstitious , and an inert people , upon whom Spanish tyranny has done its perfect work . Nominally Christians , they are nearly as much devoted to paganism as were their ancestors of the age of the Conquistadores . They are the most finished conservatives on the // face of the earth , and see ruin in change quite as readily as if they lived in New England and their opinions were worth quoting on State Street . The traveller can see in Mexican fields , to-day , the manner in which those fields were cultivated in the early days of the last Montezuma , before the Spaniard had entered the land ,  --  as in Canada he can occasionally fiud men following the customs that were brought , more than two centuries ago , from Brittany or Normandy . The Indians are practically enslaved hy two things : they are so attached to the soil on which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest of all punishments , - thus being much like those serfs who , in some other countries , are legally hound to the land , and are sold with it ; and they are forever in debt , the conse-* quence of reckless indulgence , and of that inability to think of the morrow which is the most prominent characteristic of the inferior races of men . This has caused the existence of the system of peonage , of which so much has been said in this country , in the attempts that have been made to show that slavery already prevails in Mexico . But American planters never would be content with peonage , which does not give to the employer any power over the Indians ' offspring , or convey to him any of those rights of property in his fellow-men which form the most attractive feature of slavery as it exists in the United States . They would demand something more than that ; and the system of repartimientos , under which the Indians of the time of Cort6s were divided among the conquerors , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexico to the United States . The natives would be compelled to labor far more vigorously than they now labor , and their burdens would be increased in the same ratio in which the American is more energetic and exacting than the Mexican . Under such a system , the Indians would vanish as rapidly as they did from Hayti , when a similar system was adopted there , soon after the discovery of America . Then would arise a demand for the revival of the slave-trade with Africa , and on the same ground on which African slavery was introduced intl America , - because the negro is better able than the Indian to meet the demands which the white man makes upon the weaker races who happen to be placed in his power . With such unlimited fields for the production of sugar and cotton , those leading agencies of Christianity and civilization , it would never do for the world to deny to the new school of planters a million of negroes , so necessary to the full development of the purpose of the American crusaders . Observe what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could the seas become halcyonized through the conquest of prejudices by men who believe that God is just , and that He has made of one flesh and one blood all the nations of the earth ! Even if it should not be sought to enslave the Indians of Mexico , that race would not be the less doomed . There seems to be no chance for Indians in any country into which the Anglo-Saxon enters in force . A system of free labor would be as fatal to the Mexican Indians as a system of slave labor . The whites who would throng to Mexico , on its conquest by Americans , and on the supposition that slavery should not be established there , would regard the Indians with sentiments of strong aversion . They would hate them , not only because they were Indians , - which would be deemed reason enough ,  --  but as competitors in industry , who could afford to work for low wages , their wants being few , and the cost of their maintenance small . It is charged against the Indians that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any other description of food . Place a flesheating race in antagonism with a race that lives on vegetables , and the former will eat up the latter . The sentiment of the whites toward the Indians is not unlike that which has been expressed by an eminent American statesman , who says that the cause of the failure of Mexico to establish for herself a national position is to be sought and found in her acknowl // edgment of the political equality of her Indian population . He would have them degraded , if not absolutely enslaved and degradation , situated as they are , implies their extinction . This is the opinion of one of the ablest men in the Democratic party , who , though a son of Massachusetts , is ready to go as far in behalf of slavery as any son of South Carolina . Another eminent Democrat , no less a man , indeed , than President Buchanan , is committed to very different views . He is the patron of Juarez , whom he would support with all the power of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the halls of the Montezumas " in the train of an American army . Now Juarez is a pure-blooded and full-blooded Indian . Not a drop of Castilian blood , blue or black , flows in his veins . He is a genuine Toltec , a member of that mysterious race which flourished in the Valley of Mexico ages before the arrival of the Aztecs , and the marvellous remains of whose works astonish the traveller in Yucatan and Guatemala . He is a native of Onjaca , one of the Pacific States , and the same that contained the vast estates bestowed upon Cort6s , to whom the Valley of Gajaca furnished his title of Marquis . A poor Indian boy , and a fruit-seller , Juarez found a patron , who saw his cleverness , and gave him an education , and so enabled him to play no common part in his country , - the independence of which he seems prepared to destroy , in the hope , perhaps , of securing for it a stable and well-ordered government .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
