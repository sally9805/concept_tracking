NEW ENGLANDER . No . CVIII . JULY , 1869 . ARTICLE I-THE RELIGION OF THE FUTURE . IT is the doctrine of the New Testament that the dispensation which was introduced by Christ is to continue until the end of the world . The whole strain of the New Testament shows this ; and such passages , especially , as " of His kingdom there shall be no end , " " He must reign nutil He hath put all His enemies under His feet , " " this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations , and then shall the end come , " are proofs , with many others like them , that the Founder of Christianity and His disciples regarded it as the final act of God 's moral system for the human race . The very nature of Christ 's religion would be enough of itself to demonstrate , that it must be , if true , not a stage in a progress , but the ultimate form of religions truth and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which when fnlly ripe , is followed by the plant 's death and the end of the year . As the completion of whatever was imperfect in // Jndaism , as intended for all mankind and claiming for itself to satisty the religious wants of all , it can not be superseded by any new form of truth , or supplemented by a later and improved revelation . All the progress of mankind until the end of time and all the hopes of mankind are treasured up in it , if its claims are just . When it shall have done its work , the present condition of man on earth shall come to an end , and a state of things wholly new , a state of retribution , shall succeed . There are many persons in the present age who refuse to admit these pretensions of Christianity . It is not to be the universal , nor the ultimate religion of the world . In some respects it may have been a very great improvement on whatever of religious doctrine preceded it , and it has carried the nations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before reached ; but it is like all other religions in having no historical basis and no divine authority . The progress of the world hereafter will consist in setting aside the exclusive claims of Christ , in retaining all that in his moral precepts which will endure the storms of time , and in giving the guidance of the future to science and human insight . The religion of the future will be a religion with all that is peculiar to Christianity cast away , while something of its spirit will be retained , and with the help of this spirit , without a revelation , the coming ages will reach the point of perfection that is attainable by man . The enemies of Christianity are divided among themselves . As Atheists , Pantheists , and Theists  --  the latter of various classes-they even oppose and sometimes denounce one another . Of this irreconcilable difference of opinion , however , we intend to make no use . We will suppose that the Theists are at length to triumph ; - that they who receive the doctrines of an infinite God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who hold to a system of morals something like that of Christ , are to gain the day over all other thinkers - that the destinies of the world are to be put into their hands ; - that the religion of the future is to be as they shall shape it . Their way of thinking , we will suppose , has had its perfect work . The reign of Christianity is over . That religion which soothed sorrows // and inspired hope , which took up man amid the despair of decaying antiqnity , was his only protector through the middle ages , and led on modern civilization ; which has encouraged philosophy to reproduce the thoughts of God ; which has given security to states by its lofty morals , and exalts the poorcst of men by awakening the feeling of human brotherhood and the sense of human rights ; which has controlled and modified art and letters ,  --  that religion , we say , is fallen , its stronghold of facts is demolished , its miracles , whether to be explained historically or not , are discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ is only a man , its God has retired behind the curtain , never to reveal himself in human affairs . He spoke not to the fathers by the prophets . He speaks not to us by His Son . He will never speak to mankind . Men must do the best they can with ont Christ and without a Gospel . Let us make the most favorable supposition the case admits of-that these foes of Christ 's religion are sincere , earnest , philanthropic men , haters of all injustice and of all falsehood , that they begin their work of d*strnction with the purpose of introducing something better , and really believe that the progress of man can only be reached through their systems of thinking . Let us suppose too that unbelief creeps over the Christian world , not all at once like a stroke of paralysis , but by a slow undermining of the foundations , by an abandonment of one point after another . The Christian faith ceases not at once to be respected or admired , but becomes by degrees conscious of its weakness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less , lingers longest with the poor , the widow , the afflicted who have no weight in the world , and at length dies out and is forgotten , to be counted among the many religions , which she herself drove away from among mankind . Now we ask what the world will do without a positive , historical , revealed religion . Let the religion of the future , as we will call the rival of Christianity , start on its career with all veneration for the spirit of the Gospel ; can that veneration last ? What doctrines will be left to rear their heads above the deluge of unbelief ? What motives in favor of religion will survive the decay , the extinction of Christianity . // We propose to attempt to answer some of these questions in a spirit of candor , to look at some of the disadvantages , which will of necessity attend on such a religion , and to consider what prospects it can have of spreading over and of bettering mankind . And here let it be permitted to us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and powers of the Gospel with systems of Theism , but that , if what we are about to urge has any weight , it will be still more weighty in the comparison between Christianity and Pantheistic religions . The point again towards which we turn our remarks is not directly the truth of the religions placed side by side , nor directly their services to mankind , but rather to find out whether any religion , which lays no claim to be a revelation , even although holding fast to a personal God , can fulfill the offices of a religion for the world , and whether , if it can not , progress or civilization can take its place . T. Our first position is that the absence from a religion of historical facts is a very great weakness , or in other words that the supposed religion of the , future , being unable , as it must be , to take the form of facts and of history must be without a very great source of power . Christianity is historical in its very nature and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , without both ruining the religion and belittling the whole story of the world , for the system of redemption through Christ is a progressive work going on in the world of men , and culminating in the manifestation here below of the Son of God . The religion being a story , and a story concerning God , its evidences , it is quite natural to suppose , must not merely make an appeal to the moral judgments and sentiments , but , like all other story , must depend on the veracity of witnesses , on the truth of facts in the outer world . Moreover as religion is a practical thing , as its highest aim ever must be to be taken up into the lives of men and hence to interweave itself with all action and all history , it must exhibit life , or truth , conviction and principle in action , before our eyes ,  --  that is , it must be historical . All this the great founder of Christianity and his first followers were aware of , more so perhaps than any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present time . He sent them forth as witnesses , they took this attitude before the world and felt that this was their leading vocation . Their view of the strength of the Gospel was justified by their success . It spread , by the simple telling of a story , even among the most prejudiced , among the Jews to whom a suffering Christ was a stumbling block , and among the Greeks to whom a new religion , bursting in upon the events of the present world , was a thing not so much as dreamed of . It is true that it contained a system of doctrines , a philosophy suited to man 's wants , to his convictions , to his deepest nature , but it is equally true that the philosophy could not have existed separate from the facts and that by the fa2cts it was recommended , impressed , and established . To this force of the historical element in religion the systems of heathenism bear testimony . On whatever principle we account for the religions of nature , it is evident that their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deity out of the region of abstract thought , to represent him to the human senses and in contiguity with man , to call him within the limits of space and time . The great interest , the great charm of heathenism consists in its mythology , as India , Greece , Scandinavia , and even the new world bear witness : if its views of the Divine Being had not taken the form of a narrative , if the Gods had not been represented as living and moving and acting among men , it would have lacked the power to fascinate and in a measure to satisfy the human soul . The Romans , who had at first a sober religion without image worship and with a scanty mythology , to a good degree deserted their earlier and vaguer system for the more beautiful , more copious , more imaginative fables of the Greeks . Upon mythology xvorship in a considerable degree depends ; the sacredness of particular spots , the reasons for particular rites , the character of the rites themselves , are all to be referred to ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by mythology , they draw their materials from its fables , they act originally as its handmnaids . And , when heathenism decays , as decay it must , the overthrow grows out of philosophical views and historical criticism rejecting the // narratives handed down from ancient times . All these and many like considerations show that religion would appear dead and barren to mankind if it assumed an abstract philosophical form , that it would not come home to the soul or have a sway over the life . Even the decay of heathenism in the Roman empire , that strange time when the old religion tried to brace itself up against the spread of doubt and of Christianity , indicates a longing for the appearance again of the Deity amid human events ; the magic rites , the mysteries , the theurgic processes by which men sought to come into communication with the spiritual world , were , as it seems to us , so many testimonies of human nature that the Gospel by means of its narrative form , that the economy of our religion from the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and human wants , so that they who expect much from a religion of mere abstractions must be most signally disappointed . And this experience of mankind under heathenism and Christianity makes it probable that the nature of man itself , rather than anything so variable as the style of culture and of knowledge , pronounces a historical form to be necessary for the sway of religious ideas among mankind . This is made more than probable by several considerations . Our nature , except when under strict philosophical training , of which few are capable and from which many turn away in disgust , revolts from abstractions and delights in concrete realities . We are made to take pleasure in personal existences and in their actions . Our sentiments need some object on which they can fasten . Reverence is not content with existing as a vague feeling , but seeks for some reality which may be the object of worship . The feeling of dependence needs to have that on which we are dimly conscious of depending body itself forth in some apprehensible form . T14anlefulnes8 implies the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so all our feelings go forth only towards distinctly apprehended personalities . But personalities evidence and manifest themselves through actions which have to do with life and the world . So also the imagination is distressed-so to speak-if it can not o4ve form to the invisible and the ideal . The Christian religion could // not hold its ground in the world but through a personal attachment to Christ . How then can a religion , with no attraction derived from history and personal power , expect to be met by human sympathy and to spread through mankind . But again a religion which has no history must be destitute of the power of life and example . Life , considered in relation to religion , is the embodiment and test of doctrine or principle . Example is an illustration or acting ont of principle in a particular case , and implies an inifuence on the imitative nature of man . Nothing gives so much power or weakness to a man as his life . Nothing tests a religion so much as the way in which it moulds the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central power in Christianity . The treasury of the Church is the good lives of all faithful Christians , not because they can do more than they ought , as the iRomnanists supposed , but because they act just as they should . The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the Church , not so much because they dared to die for what they prized , as because there lay behind the martyr 's faith a life that rose above the ordinary level . If Christianity had not put on a living form , if it could not have passed at once from high and loving precepts into the shape of pure men and women , we should not be defending it now . Forgiveness might have sounded sweet in precept , but if Christ and his dying disciple , Stephen , had not forgiven , where would the humanity of the world have been at this time . It seems certain then that the strength of Christianity , as of Judaism before it , lay in its history , in the lives which it formed , and especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect model . But for facts in the life of Jesus , the cloud of witnesses would not have surrounded us , the host of shining ones would not have arisen in our sky . Mere precept , although invested with celestial authority , can effect little ; an abstract standard of character , not realized in the life , will be almost destitute of power for the great mass of mankind . But the man whose religion , as he thinks , is to control the future , may ask whether it can not become the " heir of all the ages ; " whether all that has been good and pure in the Jives of men , under the Gospel and under heathenism , can not be col // lected and used for the good of mankind . Why may not Christ , with his saints , stand on the calendar of that religion , even as the heathen emperor , Alexander Severus , built a temple to Christ , and counted Him among his Gods . Meanwhile , he will say , the religion itself will be forming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and setting them up for the veneration of all future time . What success this proposed religion may have in the way of making godly and finished lives we do not propose now to consider . But this is certain , that a great part of the glory of Christian lives must then be effaced and lost . For Christ will have become a self-deceiver , and the view of his own character under which he acted was false . You can not separate his consciousness of a peculiar relation to God from his life itself , and you can not separate the life of his followers from a faith in him as divine , and from the power of those truths which he taught , and which , on the supposition , have turned out to be false or to be without divine authority . Either , then , veneration and respect for the character of Christ and of the best Christians will in a good degree cease , or it will be accounted a thing of small importance , whether that be true or false which controls the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characters known to time world . II . The supposed new reli ion of the future must be a religion without authority , a religion constructed by human reason alone . The Christian religion claims a two-fold divine authority ; it is from God and by God ,  --  it is a revelation contained in inspired writings , . Even if you gave up the latter source of authority , you would not cut all its connection with heaven , unless the claim to inspiration be part and parcel of the revelation itself . Nor is the Christian religion solitary in advancing such claims , but all over the world , wherever religions have sprung up , they have declared themselves to be disclosures of the Divine will . Nor is it important to our argument to decide whether these religions have been the product of imposture , or of the myth-making power , or of a self-deluding enthusiasm . If impostures , they confess a need of some authority beyond their inventors . If the offspring of a mythmaking age , they clothe themselves in the garb of revelation // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dress . If they grow np in an individual mind of large imaginative power , the same craving for a connection with God and for an inspiration from Him is manifest . It is further evident that the reception of religion in the world , has much depended upon faith in its divine origin . That Christ was a teacher come from God was an essential element of his power , without which many would have refused to listen to His words , and few , if any , wonid have followed Him . The churches founded by the apostles were founded on faith in a divine interruption of the natural order of things . And so the written word is indebted for no small part of its power , for the attention originally given to it in spite of its defects of composition , for the hold it has had on the best minds of the world to a belief that it is in some way anthorized to give the news of a plan of God , which man 's own faculties could not discover , that it contains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason . And hence , if at any time the evidences of the Christian religion lose their hold on the faith of any age , the religion itself is abandoned . We are now thrown back upon reason ; we must decide between different schools of philosophy , or follow our inward light , or be tossed on the uncertain waters of scepticism . And the need of divine authority for the guidance of our faith and conduct is felt by many of the strongest minds to be so great , that it is only with extreme reluctance , and by a kind of necessity which is harrowing to the soul , that they blow out the light that was their guide and commit themselves tp the direction of reason . They feel when they reject the Gospel that some authorized guide , some standard of truth , some charter , speaking pardon , spiritual help and hope , would be divinely precious . The contrast between Christianity , as authorized to make God known to men-not indeed shedding full light on every side , but satisfying and stimniating without snppressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is one that reaches to the very foundations of the soul 's life . Religion in the soul would shrink into pitiably small dimensions without the guidance and authority of a supernatural revelation . What is to become of faith in spiritual realities , in what God thinks of conduct , // in what He is and how He will treat men , if the Scriptures are of " private interpretation , " if Christ spoke without authority , if no one hath come down from heaven to tell the world of heavenly things ? What will trust find to lean upon , if the " great and precious promises " are of human origin ? Where will repentance go for refuge if there is no assurance of pardon ? How will the soul be made strong enongh to resist sin , if there is no certainty of divine assistance ? How cau such a hope of heaven as reason cau establish , fortify the erring against earthly trials and help them to die in peace ? In short , since every religious feeling , every virtue , all morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience demonstrates , by the voice of God in His word , will there not be an end of all these things , and must not religion become so uncertain , so weak , when Christ shall be given up , as to have next to no power over human life and society ? Without divine authority , evidence and motive power are taken away from religion , and without these what can it do for the good of man ? Kay , without assurance concerning those great questions that perplex unaided reason , will not the main energy of human thought be turned towards the problems of philosophy and away from practical virtue ? Can a religion drawn up out of man 's own soul satisfy his reason ? Will there not be eternal questionings , as there were among the old philosophers ? Will not the main strength of the greatest minds be spent in finding out truth , instead of reducing it to practice and using it for human improvement ? At present to a very great extent Christianity satisfies the cravings of the soul by its truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which claims no such authorities bring into the world save doubt , restlessness , self-dissatisfaction and wandering , unsuccessful efforts after rest ? To make the immense importance of divine authority more apparent , let us briefly sketch the progress of subjective religion , as we find it arising and increasing under the Gospel . In the first instance there is a recognition , founded on positive precepts , of a divine law reaching to the thoughts and intents of the heart . This the moral sense approves and adopts as its rule , but what would become of the standard of action , if the // outward authority were to be disregarded and denied ? Is it not certain that the divine requirement , as things are , originates and sustains all the convictions of the necessity of a religious life , and awakens a sense of want and a sense of sin by which the soul is led to God ? Then again in the pathway of our return to God we are met by positive assurances of danger on the one hand , and positive offers of forgiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion on the Christian plan could not begin to exist . And the terms of forgiveness , contained in these revelations which the Gospel makes , are the outward resting place on which the peace of the soul through a long life reposes . What assurance can it find within itself or in the plan of the world large enough to fill the place of this authority ? Then the whole of internal religion is obviously maintained by declarations of scripture , some of which , singly , have afforded more comfort than all the reasonings and selfencouragements of unaided minds since the world began . A life of inward morality and of holiness is built on the Scriptural exhibition of God and His holiness . A life of benevolence is a following of the precepts , and of the lives which are precepts , that the Scriptures afford us . A life of hope needs distinct statements , and these must embrace both worlds . A life of unworldliness and self-renunciation needs promises to support it in its weakness , lest it should have given up everything to gain nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul , whether it consists in escaping from sin , or in reconciliation of heart to God , or in acts of morality or of philam thropy or of piety , or in the development of certain feelings , or in the formation of a certain character , it needs throughout and actually uses the support of the Scriptures , as the guide of faith , the directory of life , the support of every feeling of the heart . What must happen then , when this revealed word shall have been abandoned , when its former influence shall have ceased , when its light shall have faded away from the world 's atmosphere , but that religion must lose its hold on the world , must dwindle down into a feeble , sickly , timorous thing , looking every way for help to itself ; if it do not quite expit e ? // But it will be said by a portion of those who hope to see a new universal religion rise up on the ruins Qt Christianity , that their faith is in a certain sense from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good man , every man who walks according to the inward light is in a sense an inspired man . Christ had with Him more truth than any other human being , becanse He was better than any . Thus there is a kind of natural inspiration of the human race , which is slowly perfe*ting truth , eliminating errors , bringing man from the outward and historical , from the claims to divine authorityproved now to be unreliable and yet for a ong time serving as stepping stones in human progress  --  to the pure ultimately recognized inner light of the soul . There is much of beauty and attractiveness in such a theory as this , but it can not stand the test of truth and sound philosophy . It takes no account of the weakness of human reason , as demonstrated by the history of opinions ,  --  of the vain efforts , for instance , made by the Greek philosophers to attain to theological truth , and of their hopeless diversity of views ending in scepticism . It takes no account of the subsequent history of philosophical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not withstanding all the efforts of highly gifted minds in the idealistic and pantheistic schools , to reach any assurance in regard to any doctrine of religion . It takes no account of the diversities of opinion , into which men of insight have been or may be led , either from confounding their insight and the conclusions of their understandings , or because insight itself , at least in the present condition of human nature , is an unsafe guide . It demands that a man should be good in order to have a true insight , but how is he to be good except by truth which insight discovers , and how is he to be followed by those who have no such clear insight as his ? Would Christ have been a lawgiver arid an example for mankind , if he had spoken out his own private feelin s without any claim to divine authority . The theory then will at length discover that it is decking itself in the robes of Christianity , that its ilhmmuination and insight are really borrowed from the Gospel , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a historic revelation , at once darkness and distrust will begin to cm eep // again over the minds of men whom Christianity had somewhat enlighted . This theory moreover discloses its own inconsistency and falsehood by the position which it takes in regard to Christ . The wisest , best , humblest , most unsel*sh of men , as is conceded , he made the most stupendous mistake in regard to himself , and brought it about that this mistake became engrafted on his religion , nay-that it gave to his religion its distinctive character and its power in the world . So much light with so much darkness , such lofty purity united to such false claims of exaltation above the measure of a human being-this was the wisdom and excellence , this the insight of Jesus Christ . If he had insight and nothing more , is not his insight wholly unreliable , since he failed to see into himself ? III . The supposed religion of the future will of necessity have a very limited range of doctrines . Religious doctrine is the measure and sum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear ppon character . If the doctrines are false or immoral , they will form perverted or defective characters ; if scanty , they will have little effect on character ; if merely metaphysical and not ethical , they will have no effect on character whatever . It has been claimed by the friends of Christianity that it is intensely practical , that its grand truths or doctrines , especially those which are connected with its grand facts or history , have a direct and most healthy bearing on human life , that it contains enough of truth to finish human character on all its sides , and that , when believed , it actually forms characters of the highest excellence . The question then is how much loss of power over human nature will arise from a rejection of the most important and distinctive doctrines of Christianity ; by the side of which question stand others already answered , how much power will be lost by losing the vital force of a historical rcli*ion , and how much will be lost by losing the authority of revelation and throwing men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible at this time to predict what shape the doctrines of the new religion *f the future will ultimately take . But thus much we can say , that if it should start with a certain apparatus of doctrines , part of them will at length be // broken or not used at all , aud that owing to the influence of Christian education , which its advocates can not now escape , its motive power and seeming excellence will be greatest at first , and will be growing less aud less afterward . But let us try to form a candid estimate , as far as probabilities will allow , of the amount of truth aud motive that will be within the reach of this religion of the future , and that can be used in endeavoring to give finish to moral and religions character . First , whatever is especially Christian , as distinguished from natural religiou and from the conclusions of human reason , must be given up . The doctrine that the word became flesh , - that God sent His Son to redeem men from sin-will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the part of Jesus or an unauthorized addition to His teachings . Thus , His relations to God and to man being put on a wholly different basis , lie ceases to be a great personage governing the world 's history , and sinks into a teacher who mistook His own nature most fearfully , and from whose most authentic doctrines very much must be lopped off . That this alone would make a revolution in the world , greater than any since the birth of Christ himself , can not be questioned . Oh ! what other throne , what dynasty of high born kings reaching through ages and famed through the world , could fall , which man might not forget in a century ! But this kingdom over hearts , this invis ible sway of Christ beginning in the self-consecration of the soul and ending in the entire renovation of society and of gov eminent , when can it cease to be regretted ? Oh ! what lapse of time , what changes in outer things will prevent the world from bleeding at every pore through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its stability ! Secondly , the doctrine concerning God and His providence must be reduced to its lowest dimensions . Whether the reigning form of this new religion will cling firmly to the personality of God , as a cardinal point , and drive Pantheists as a her etical sect beyond its pale , can not be distinctly anticipated . But suppose its standard doctrine to be that human nature within itself ; apart from proof , contains a recognition of a deity , when we come to the doctrine of providence and of spiritual // influence , the ground is more uncertain . To a providence , in any such sense that any interruptions of the common course of physical law can be admitted , it can not subscribe , for it rejects all the miracles of the past . And thus it can scarcely teach , with any show of consistency , that prayer can in any way affect the order of things , or be an argument with God for bestowing blessings on the worshipers . Moreover , without a positive revelation , that speaks of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is increasingly hard to put faith in that high doctrine , for every advance of science thrusts Him to a remoter distance . He has left the reins on the neck of time , and inhabits His eternity as a vital energy , without concern or pity for man . What check can the religion of the future apply to this tendency to shut God out of the visible and actual present ? Must it not succumb to the relentless blows of science , and lose its faith in a hand guiding the world , since positive and natural religion together find it so hard to furnish strong enough antidotes against scepticism ? The doctrine of spiritual influence , for ought that we can see , it may with consistency admit . But who can tell whether such influences can be hoped for , since they proceed from the free will of a sovereign , who has made no promises either in an external revelation or to the soul ? May they be prayed for ? What encouragement is there even to begin to pray , much more to persevere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be the appointed lot of man to struggle alone against internal evils , as he must by the law of his nature against outward ? In this state of uncertainty there will not be much prayer , and without Divine help the hope of improving the character will decline . Does not this single consideration show that a great part of practical religion will be cut up by the roots ? Thirdly , the doctrine concerning man which Christianity has taught us will need great modification . If the Gospel 's view of sin could be retained without its remedial provisions , if a sense of guilt with no assurance of forgiveness could settle upon souls under the new religion , as now , mankind would cry out against it in desperation , they would flee away from leaden clouds of death which let no rays of hope through , or would // wander , if not desperate , into all kinds of heathenish ways of propitiating God . Will it be said that the glimpses which we catch witbout revelation of the Divine clemency and forbearance would be enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they might satisty a weak sense of sin but could not comfort a deep one . The sense of sin then , as of a malady at the root of our nature for which each one of us is responsible , would very much fade away . God nevei* having by any revelation from heaven disclosed his wrath against all ungodliness and nnrighteonsness of men , what sufficient evidence would there be that sin is a very great evil , how would it be seen to alienate the soul from Hun , what reason would there be to dread His frown ? Nor is it unlikely that sin would be regarded as a transitional state in the necessary progress of human nature . And it seems likely that the efforts against it would be confined principally to the rectification of society , to the removal of ignorance , to the relief of the lower classes , on the ground that human nature is not bad , that evil emanates from society and can be effectually obstructed and dried up by outward reformations . However this may be , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of sin would be benumbed . But is it not evident that the cost of this would be immense ? Must there not ensue a weakening of the very foundations of morality ? Could the family , could society endnre this ? Will the religion of the future be able to endure it ? Will not faith in God , and faith in unalterable morality , in holiness and justice , stand or fall together with faith in sin ? Must there not then be a further plunge of a demoralized world into Atheism ? Fourthly , the doctiine concerning the last things will very probably be an open , unsettled question . Only a glance at the history of opinion down to the most recent times is enough to show that man has in vain sought to solve the problem of the immortality and future destiny of the soul . But let the religion of the future pronounce a decisive word on these high doe - trines ; how little will it gain since it has no new proofs to bring forward , and has nothing but human insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being admitted , are there to be rewards and punishments ? May sin , here , affect our state in // that future life ? If it may , we need some help from God , which the religion does not make sure . If it may not , of what value is the future life in relation to conduct ? What is the future life in that case but a barren fact standing a great way off ? Thus , whether we consider the uncertainty in which the religion must remain concerning a future life , or the slender use it makes of this doctrine in the way of a motive and of elevating man above worldly things , it will be found quite indifferent whether the doctrine be retained or discarded ; at the best , it will be an appendage of no importance . The whole of what we have said thus far , and especially the consideration of the slender stock of truth at the disposal of the religion of the future , makes it clear that the motive power of such a religion , its influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some room will be left for reverence , and for the sense of dependence ; thankfulness also may be awakened to a degree , although crippled by doubts concerning Providence . But how narrow will be the reach of trust , how feeble the vigor of hope , having no promises to feed upon ; how poor a part will be played by faith in things unseen ! And if the doctrine of immortal life gives an immense amplitude to human action , enlarges our sense of our own importance in the universe , and adds untold force to the reasons for improving our character , how lame will all efforts at moral excellence be , how small the motive , how trifling the issues of conduct , when this great truth shall be feebly held or quite discarded ! But in lieu of all other considerations touching this point we urge that the new religion will have no fuel for love towards God , that the harmony of the human and divine soul will be nearly impossible . The justice of this remark will stand iii a clear light if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love , we mean , as involving complacency , confidence , and general harmony of spirit ,  --  and how it differs from some other feelings that play a part in religion . The feeling of reverence will be aroused according to the laws of our nature , although we may have a very dun perception of the power that we revere . So the sense of dependence implies indeed an object on which we depend , but gives no light in regard to the qualities of that object . But love needs for its ex // istence some sort of disclosure o* ' revelation of the feelings and character of the object towards which it goes forth . Between man and man love can not arise , unless one party has a manifestation of the character and feelings of the other . We can not love an unknown person , nor love on conjecture , nor love an intellect . It is the same in the case of the Divine Being . There must go before all love to him some conviction of his moral excellence , and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in return . And hence , again , there must be some persuasion that he can regard sinners with favor in spite of their sins . The history of heathenism , the convictions of our own sinful natures , will show us that a sense of guilt without an assurance of pardon must drive men from the face of God ; they will show us the justice of those words , " We love Him because he first loved us . " Now then if the Gospel which pretends to be a revelation of God 's character and of his mercy is to be abandoned as untrue , what room is left for man 's love to him ? He has become an unknown God ; how can we love him of whose character we know little , and of his feelings towards us , next to nothing ? Will it be said that something within us leads us irresistibly to conceive of him as absolute moral perfection ? Were we to grant this , which the diversities of human religions do not justify , yet love requires more , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and how do we gain any information on this point from our insights and instinctive judgments ? If our nature assures us that he loves the good , must it not equally reveal to us his alienation from the morally evil * How then with our conscience of sin can we love him whom we have offended , love him of whose pardon we have no assurance , love him in whose sight our nature is unholy ? Love , then , in its highest and noblest forms must be a stranger to the religion of the future . If love to God is the crown of our character , if to call such a sentiment into life constitutes one of the chief glories of Christ 's religion , as well as one of the great sources of its strength , must not a religion that knows little of God , and nothing of forgiveness , be incapable of forming beautiful lives ? Must it not perish and become despised from its very weakness ? // In short , the religion will be of this earth , getting next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from a life of faith . Can the age when it shall be established fail of being intensely worldly , and epicurean ? Think of the art and literature of such an age : think of the spirit they must breathe ; think of the loss of motives for morality and a religious life at whiTh we hinted just now . Can such a prospect fail to excite deep alarm ? IV . We remark very briefly that the new religion of which we speak will be without the strength derived from a church and its institutions . The Christian Church of the present , with all its faults and weaknesses , is the salt and the light of the world . As holding , preserving , and spreading the faith of Christ , as built on the feeling of brotherhood , and on trust in a common Saviour , as bound together by social worship , sacraments , a ministry and a discipline , and as containing in itself a self-reforming power , it is one of the bonds which bind mankind together , and on it the hopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extends far beyond its own pale , and beyond the religious interests of luau ; it originates or aids every effort to make him wiser , happier , and more manly . What now can take the place of the church , or compensate man for its fall , as fall it must , if the old historical religion is abandoned ? What common hopes , what common object of reverence or love will the new religion have to offer to its professors , nay , what common faith can it supply them with , except a few meagre shreds not large enough to cover the nakedness of reason ? It must have worship , but what kind of worship ? That in which sentimentality and taste take the lead , with the fewest , the weakest appeals to religious feeling . Will it introduce prayer into its public services , when the question of an answer to prayer is unsettled , or denied ; or thanksgiving , when a Providence is doubted , and blind law accounts for all things ? Can it have institutions ? Institutions of a historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no history from which to draw them . Institutions made for the sake of having them it can invent , but how weak the // hold on the mind of man of such institutions , how small their venerableness ! What can it have or find to replace the sacred supper ? Compare the fellowship pertaining to such a dead skeleton of a religion with membership in Christ . Compare its preaching on a narrow round of dogmas with the inexhaustible themes of the Christian pulpit . Must not , in fact , morality take the place of religion in the pulpit , and religious doctrine be no more looked to a suggesting the great motives of action ! Compare the probable zeal for its propagation with that resulting from the nature of the Gospel , and from the command of Christ , " Go ye into all the world . " Can there be much zeal for its diffusion , especially as long as its friends maintain that the systems of heathenism involve all the essential truths of religion ? Wherever we turn , then , we discover its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will make no place for itself in the affections of human souls . Y. If these things are so , human progress must cease , and civilization , whenever the world shall throw away its faith in revealed religion , , must decline . We seem to ourselves to have sh9wn , that , whether the form , the evidence , the substance , the motive power , or the social influences of the new rival of Christianity be taken into view , it is wholly weak and unreliable . Can the destinies of mankind be safely entrusted to a religion without facts , without authority , with a minimum of doctrines , and with no institutions at all ? Must not the advancement of society in all that is good , cease , if Christianity is to lose its hold over the faith and love of men . If a large factor be thrown out of the account , must not the product be greatly lessened ? There is but one answer to this question : such a decline must take place , unless in the future , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religion . Just this , we suppose , is what many thinkers anticipate , who have rejected the claims of Christianity . We apprehend , that , as a class , those who have looked upon bare Theism as the heir and suecessor of the Gospel , do not put very much of dependence upon this predicted religion of the future ; we conceive that it is expected to take its place as a handmaid and not as a mistress , while civilization , or progress , is looked upon as the coining // Queen of the world . The bitter taunt of the Greek poet is to be fulfilled , who makes his sophist say , that vortex or whirl has expelled Jupiter from his throne ; God is to cease to reign and Progress will take his place. * This doctrine of progress may adopt the form of a fatal development , or that of a free advance in accordanc&amp; with a divine plan . The first form , or that which it must assume in a pantheistic theory of the world , does not now concern us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who rejects the scriptures , can embrace , will be something like this : that , in the course of tune there will be such an accumulation of knowledge , such a lifting up of man above nature , such improvements in government and legislation , such refinement diffused through society , that even in the lowest classes , the propension will he towards sobriety , honesty , chas tity , and kindness . And so a very little influence from religion , very little knowledge of God , or concern about him will give all needed aid to the advancement of mankind . A theory of human progress like this deserves , on account of its importance , an extended examination ; we must content ourselves , however , with two or three remarks that bear on our subject more immediately : we observe , then , 1 . First , that facts do not justify the hope of such a progress ; we mean , that the improvements which have been made in society must be ascribed chiefly to Christianity ; that advances in physical science have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ameliorations of governments and of society can scarcely begin , cannot be permanent , without the aid of religion . It is apparent that a benevolent feeling aroused by the Gospel has , in fact , had very much to do with modern reforms ; with reforms , for example , in prison discipline , in the houses , habits , and privileges of the poor , in promoting temperance , in putting an end to the slave trade and to slavery , in sending light to the ignorant , in endeavoring to spread the spirit of peace . Christ 's religion has in fact taken the lead in schemes for the benefit of society , and it will be scarcely maintained that , while thus at the head of this blessed movement , it has // crippled or suppressed other benevolent forces , which can take its place when it shall become extinct . For where are they ? Were they in action when the Gospel overcame heathenism , and were they put in the background by it as by some jealous monarch ? On the other hand , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be vastly lessened . The field will be earthly relations almost exclusively . The energy will be paralyzed , when the conception of God 's kingdom on earth , when faith in Divine influences shall be discarded , when the doctrine of a future life shall be disbelieved , or just clung to , amid the waves of uncertainty . Again , the advance of science does not , in fact , secure the advance of society , notwithstanding all the efforts of Christians and other benevolent persons . As far as the past can teach us , science may add indefinitely to its stores , while society continues corrupt or degenerates . There are armies of thieves and of reprobates , worse than heathens , within sound of the voice of the great lecturers of Paris . Officers of preventive and of correctional police have plenty of work to do in all large cities , both in Europe and this free land . In some respects the dangerous classes in large towns are worse than they were . They know more , and are more excitable . Their knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meaning of life , being in fact such as a class of men without religion would gather , makes them craftier , more able to combine , more able to evade justice . Nor is there any necessary connexion between the advance of science and the improvement of political institutions . Even the theory of politics may be conformed to true science in a nation , while yet the body politic may have no power to govern itself or to shake off abuses . The moral energy , the spirit of self-sacrifice , the courage to attempt reform in the right way , the hope of success , the healthful tone of opinion in society concerning justice ,  --  all these and other sources of national health are far less dependent on the state of science than on religious and moral influences . Nations , in order to grow great , or become free , or remain free , must , like single men , have strength of character , and this is mainly from moral and // religious culture , or from a certain simplicity of life which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second place theories of human progress like that at which we are looking , misconceive of and underrate the power appropriate to religion in the civilization of the world , and also give an exceedingly earthly view of life . They misconceive of the civilizing power of the Gospel . At least they seem to conceive of Christians as thinking that religion of itself , without the aid of any other agencies , is the sole source of human improvement and civilization . But the true and received statement is that religion controls the forces which mould and refine the soul and society . It is the mainspring or the governing wheel which gives motion , and it also regulates and harmonizes all movement . It is in harmony with all truth and in sympathy with all improvement , but it acts not only through its own direct invisible power , but through the laws of nature , of the soul , and of society . It looks on the science of nature with favor , because this is an exposition of the thoughts of God , and thus science has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It sends the individual 's thoughts within , and thus aids the science of the soul . It makes him aware of his rights and his duties , and thus helps to build up a true philosophy of man in the State , as well as a just society . It elevates his feelings and purifies his taste , and thus gives wing to true art . It is the foe of vice , and thus of all ignorance and of all oppression . But its glory lies in making " all things new , " not without other agencies , but through its control over them , and through its sway over the individual soul . Again , in such theories of civilization the power of the Christian religion seems to be greatly underrated . In the first place , a due value is not set upon that which is distinctively Christian , as compared with that which belongs to Judaism and to natural religion . The history of Christian art , the examination of religious experience , if we look to no other sources of proof , will show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that which is new in Christianity , from Christ in His person , life , and work , from forgiveness of sins and redemption , from the doctrine of the Holy Spirit , from the judg // ment and the future state . Take all this away , and you Ltke away , if we are not deceived , nearly all that constitutes the superiority and the glory of Christian civilization . But again , such theories contemplate the civilizing forces of Christianity as standing side by side with those of literature , art science , law , and government . Tariffs , roads , and printing presses are held to be as original and as efficient benefactors of society , as bibles and sermons . But this seems to be a very serious mistake , which grows out of another , still more fundamental , corkeerning the nature of man ,  --  an assumption that he is nufallen , that he has all power within himself without the aid of new truth from heaven to elevate his condition . Is it not evident that the system of practical forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and loved , govern the will , heart , and life of the individual , and that through the amelioration of the individual all civilizing influences will be either perfected or originated ? What the Gospel has done or can do in the way of benefiting society , the institutions it founds , the science it warms into life ought not surely to be alleged as reasons why we can get along at some future day without the Gospel . The Gospel is not the schoolmaster who leaves the grown up pupil to be guided by his own reason ; it is the leaven hid in the meal until the whole mass i8 leavened . The conservation of society can be entrusted only to moral and religions forces . If religion has no moving , preserving , checking , or balancing power , or if as is true of heathenism , it is itself immoral , then art , literature , whatever promotes the advance of society , is paralyzed or corrupted ; and there comes on a decline of society , as in Greece after Alexander and inRome under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the other hand , if , as is true in the case of Christianity , the religion is ethical in the highest sense , in the sense not only of teaching morals but of enlarging the conception of what is right and supplying the highest motives for the ennoblement of character , then there is a foundation laid on which society , with all its interests , can rest , and there is opportunity for all that progress which is possible in consistency with the condition of man . // We are now prepared to say , that if the influences from the Gospel should be withdrawn , a most earthly civilization , one having its own doom written on its forehead , would take the place of that which Christianity has been the leading agent in forming . Suppose , for instance , that all thinkers should lose faith in the immortality of the soul . Is it not evident that with the abandonment of this one truth the concerns of the present world would begin to assume a new relative importance , that all motives drawn from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must rise in value , and self-denial fall , that all the aspirations of man must droop and wither ? Is it not evident that something of that mingled frivolity and despair which Atheism engenders , and of which heathen society , especially in its decay when its faith is lost , gives us examples , would brood over the world ? For how could civilization fail to decline , when frivolity blighted the taste and depraved the moral judgments , and when despair , the sense of the emptiness of life , took away the stimulus from all noble endeavor ? 3 . Finally , in one very important respect the very progress of society demands the assurances and supports of positive Christian truth . As knowledge and refinement increase , the standard of character tends to rise , and along with it will deepen the feeling of responsibility and the pain of falling below the standard . A sense of imperfection-of sinfulness if we may call it so , as keen as any other sense and more indestructible , will then be in vigorous exercise . How is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had its method of satisfying the consciousness of sin , its reconciliation of man and God , in which lay no small part of its strength . Christianity has its method , and herein lies much of the service which it has rendered to mankind . But naked Deism , the religion of human insight and natural reason , says nothing of pardon and redemption , nothing of a helping , life-giving spirit . In this respect it occupies a much weaker position than that which is taken by the systems of necessary development . They legitimately deny the reality of moral evil . It has for them no existence , because the will is not free , or because sin , being a necessary stage for finite minds , is not objectively evil . But a system , in which a personal God is a central principle , can not // extinguish the sense of sill or deny its reality . Kay , the further the true refinement of society is carried , the higher the standard of character is raised , and the vaster the creation is shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glory are spread around the throne of God . Sin , then , teuds to enlarge in its dimensions before the eye of a refined age which has not thrown aside its faith in the moral attributes of God . But Deism has nothing to satisfy this sense of sin but baseless hopes and analogies drawn from the unexplained dealings of God . If God ought to forgive because the best conceptions of human virtue include forgiveness , He ought to have indignation against sin because that too enters as an element into our ideal of perfect character . And how terrible that indignation ! What distance so vast as that between the Infinite One , inhabiting His dwelling place of holiness , and a soul conscious of selfishness and of impurity ! The course of things , if Deism should be the ultimate form of religion , would be something like this . As long as the recollections and influences of Christianity survived its fall , earnest souls would hope on , they would stay their soul-hunger on the milk drawn from the breasts of their dead mother . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not in despair ; or else , throwing aside their Deism which brings before their wearied minds the unsolved problem of the relations of sinning man to a holy God , they would hunt after peace in the fields of Atheistic or Pantheistic philosophy . Civilization with God but without Christ leads to a terrible dilemma . If the sense of sin remain , the life of all noble souls will be an anxious , gloomy tragedy . Or if that burden so crushing is thrown off as in a life struggle , then the standard of character will fall and the sense of sin grow faint to such a degree that the pardon from God craved in heathenism will not be needed , and the utmost frivolity will be reached of life and manners . In either case the progress of civilization will be stopped ; the world of the future will be doomed ; and the " religion of the future " will turn out to be a miserable raft , unfit , after the shipwreck of Christianity , to carry the hopes and the welfare of mankind down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
