CHAPTER I. THE MISTRESS . " Strength , and honour are her clothing ; and she shall rejoice in time to come . She openeth her mouth with wisdom ; and in her tongue is the law of kindness . She looketh well to the ways of her household ; and eateth not the bread of idleness . Her children arise up , and call her blessed ; her husband also , and he praiseth her . "  --  Proverbs , xxxi. 25-28 . I. AS WITH THE COMMANDER OF AN ARMY , or the leader of any enterprise , so is it with the mistress of a house . Her spirit will be seen through the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duties intelligently and thoroughly , so will her domestics follow in her path . Of all those acquirements , which more particularly belong to the feminine character , there are none which take a higher rank , in our estimation , than such as enter into a knowledge of household duties ; for on these are perpetually dependent the happiness , comfort , and well-being of a family . In this opinion we are borne out by the author of " The Vicar of Wakefield , " who says : " The modest virgin , the prudent wife , and the careful matron , are much more serviceable in life than petticoated philosophers , blustering heroines , or virago queens . She who makes her husband and her children happy , who reclaims the one from vice and trains up the other to virtue , is a much greater character than ladies described in romances , whose whole occupation is to murder mankind with shafts from their quiver , or their eyes . " 2 . PURSUING THIS PICTURE , we may add , that to be a good housewife does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recreation ; and we think it the more necessary to express this , as the performance of the duties of a mistress may , to some minds , perhaps seem to be incompatible with the enjoyment of life . Let us , however , now proceed to describe some of those home qualities and virtues which are necessary to the proper management of a Household , and then point out the plan which may be the most profitably pursued for the daily regulation of its affairs . 3 . EARLY RISING IS ONE OF THE MOST ESSENTIAL QUALITIES which enter into good Household Management , as it is not only the parent of health , but of innumerable other advantages . Indeed , when a mistress is an early riser , it is almost certain that her house will be orderly and well-managed . On the contrary , if she remain in bed till a late hour , then the domestics , who , as we have before observed , invariably partake somewhat of their mistress 's character , will surely become sluggards . To self-indulgence all are more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants are freer from this fault than the heads of houses . The great Lord Chatham thus gave his advice in reference to this subject :  --  " I would have inscribed on the curtains of your bed , and the walls of your chamber , ' If you do not rise early , you can make progress in nothing . ' " 4 . CLEANLINESS IS ALSO INDISPENSABLE TO HEALTH , and must be studied both in regard to the person and the house , and all that it contains . Cold or tepid baths should be employed every morning , unless , on account of illness or other circumstances , they should be deemed objectionable . The bathing of children will be treated of under the head of " MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN . " 5 . FRUGALITY AND ECONOMY ARE HOME VIRTUES , without which no household can prosper . Dr. Johnson says : " Frugality may be termed the daughter of Prudence , the sister of Temperance , and the parent of Liberty . He that is extravagant will quickly become poor , and poverty will enforce dependence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be evident to every one , whether in the possession of an income no more than sufficient for a family 's requirements , or of a large fortune , which puts financial adversity out of the question . We must always remember that it is a great merit in housekeeping to manage a little well . " He is a good waggoner , " says Bishop Hall , " that can turn in a little room . To live well in abundance is the praise of the estate , not of the person . I will study more how to give a good account of my little , than how to make it more . " In this there is true wisdom , and it may be added , that those who can manage a little well , are most likely to succeed in their management of larger matters . Economy and frugality must never , however , be allowed to degenerate into parsimony and meanness . 6 . THE CHOICE OF ACQUAINTANCES is very important to the happiness of a mistress and her family . A gossiping acquaintance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , should be avoided as a pestilence . It is likewise all-necessary to beware , as Thomson sings , " The whisper 'd tale , That , like the fabling Nile , no fountain knows ;  - -  Fair- laced Deceit , whose wily , conscious aye Ne'er looks direct ; the tongue that licks the dust But , when it safely dares , as prompt to sting . " If the duties of a family do not sufficiently occupy the time of a mistress , society should be formed of such a kind as will tend to the mutual interchange of general and interesting information . 7 . FRIENDSHIPS SHOULD NOT BE HASTILY FORMED , nor the heart given , at once , to every new-comer . There are ladies who uniformly smile at , and approve everything and everybody , and who possess neither the courage to reprehend vice , nor the generous warmth to defend virtue . The friendship of such persons is without attachment , and their love without affection or even preference . They imagine that every one who has any penetration is ill-natured , and look coldly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this discernment does not always proceed from an uncharitable temper , but that those who possess a long experience and thorough knowledge of the world , scrutinize the conduct and dispositions of people before they trust themselves to the first fair appearances . Addison , who was not deficient in a knowledge of mankind , observes that " a friendship , which makes the least noise , is very often the most useful ; for which reason , I should prefer a prudent friend to a zealous one . " And Joanna Baillie tells us that " Friendship is no plant of hasty growth , Though planted in esteem 's deep-fixed soil , The gradual culture of kind intercourse Must bring it to perfection . " 8 . HOSPITALITY IS A MOST EXCELLENT VIRTUE ; but care must be taken that the love of company , for its own sake , does not become a prevailing passion ; for then the habit is no longer hospitality , but dissipation . Reality and truthfulness in this , as in all other duties of life , are the points to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is an emanation from the heart in genuine hospitality , which can not be described , but is immediately felt , and puts the stranger at once at his ease . " With respect to the continuance of friendships , however , it may be found necessary , in some cases , for a mistress to relinquish , on assuming the responsibility of a household , many of those commenced in the earlier part of her life . This will be the more requisite , if the number still retained be quite equal to her means and opportunities . 9 . IN CONVERSATION , TRIFLING OCCURRENCES , such as small disappointments , petty annoyances , and other every-day incidents , should never be mentioned to your friends . The extreme injudiciousness of repeating these will be at once apparent , when we reflect on the unsatisfactory discussions which they too frequently occasion , and on the load of advice which they are the cause of being tendered , and which is , too often , of a kind neither to be useful nor agreeable . Greater events , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and , on such occasions , their sympathy gratifies and comforts . If the mistress be a wife , never let an account of her husband 's failings pass her lips ; and in cultivating the power of conversation , she should keep the versified advice of Cowper continually in her memory , that it " Should flow like water after summer showers , Not as if raised by mere mechanic powers . " In reference to its style , Dr. Johnson , who was himself greatly distinguished for his colloquial abilities , says that " no style is more extensively acceptable than the narrative , because this does not carry an air of superiority over the rest of the company ; and , therefore , is most likely to please them . For this purpose we should store our memory with short anecdotes and entertaining pieces of history . Almost every one listens with eagerness to extemporary history . Vanity often co-operates with curiosity ; for he that is a hearer in one place wishes to qualify himself to be a principal speaker in some inferior company ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conversation . It is true , indeed , that sallies of wit and quick replies are very pleasing in conversation ; but they frequently tend to raise envy in some of the company : but the narrative way neither raises this , nor any other evil passion , but keeps all the company nearly upon an equality , and , if judiciously managed , will at once entertain and improve them all . " 10 . GOOD TEMPER SHOULD BE CULTIVATED by every mistress , as upon it the welfare of the household may be said to turn ; indeed , its influence can hardly be over-estimated , as it has the effect of moulding the characters of those around her , and of acting most beneficially on the happiness of the domestic circle . Every head of a household should strive to be cheerful , and should never fail to show a deep interest in all that appertains to the well-being of those who claim the protection of her roof . Gentleness , not partial and temporary , but universal and regular , should pervade her conduct ; for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only delights her children , but makes her domestics attentive and respectful ; her visitors are also pleased by it , and their happiness is increased . 11 . ON THE IMPORTANT SUBJECT OF DRESS AND FASHION we can not do better than quote an opinion from the eighth volume of the " Englishwoman 's Domestic Magazine . " The writer there says , " Let people write , talk , lecture , satirize , as they may , it can not be denied that , whatever is the prevailing mode in attire , let it intrinsically be ever so absurd , it will never look as ridiculous as another , or as any other , which , however convenient , comfortable , or even becoming , is totally opposite in style to that generally worn . " 12 . IN PURCHASING ARTICLES OF WEARING APPAREL , whether it be a silk dress , a bonnet , shawl , or riband , it is well for the buyer to consider three things : I. That it be not too expensive for her purse . II . That its colour harmonize with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure . III . That its tint allow of its being worn with the other garments she possesses . The quaint Fuller observes , that the good wife is none of our dainty dames , who love to appear in a variety of suits every day new , as if a gown , like a stratagem in war , were to be used but once . But our good wife sets up a sail according to the keel of her husband 's estate ; and , if of high parentage , she doth not so remember what she was by birth , that she forgets what she is by match . To Brunettes , or those ladies having dark complexions , silks of a grave hue are adapted . For Blondes , or those having fair complexions , lighter colours are preferable , as the richer , deeper hues are too overpowering for the latter . The colours which go best together are green with violet ; gold-colour with dark crimson or lilac ; pale blue with scarlet ; pink with black or white ; and gray with scarlet or pink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give life to it . Gray and pale blue , for instance , do not combine well , both being cold colours . 13 . THE DRESS OF THE MISTRESS should always be adapted to her circumstances , and be varied with different occasions . Thus , at breakfast she should be attired in a very neat and simple manner , wearing no ornaments . If this dress should decidedly pertain only to the breakfast-hour , and be specially suited for such domestic occupations as usually follow that meal , then it would be well to exchange it before the time for receiving visitors , if the mistress be in the habit of doing so . It is still to be remembered , however , that , in changing the dress , jewellery and ornaments are not to be worn until the full dress for dinner is assumed . Further information and hints on the subject of the toilet will appear under the department of the " LADY'S-MAID . " The advice of Polonius to his son Laertes , in Shakspeare 's tragedy of " Hamlet , " is most excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will equally apply to a " fayre ladye : "  --  " Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy , But not express 'd in fancy ; rich , not gaudy ; For the apparel oft proclaims the man . " 14 . CHARITY AND BENEVOLENCE ARE DUTIES which a mistress owes to herself as well as to her fellow-creatures ; and there is scarcely any income so small , but something may be spared from it , even if it be but " the widow 's mite . " It is to be always remembered , however , that it is the spirit of charity which imparts to the gift a value far beyond its actual amount , and is by far its better part . True Charity , a plant divinely nursed , Fed by the love from which it rose at first , Thrives against hope , and , in the rudest scene , Storms but enliven its unfading green ; Exub'rant is the shadow it supplies , Its fruit on earth , its growth above the skies . Visiting the houses of the poor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each family ; and although there may be difficulties in following out this plan in the metropolis and other large cities , yet in country towns and rural districts these objections do not obtain . Great advantages may result from visits paid to the poor ; for there being , unfortunately , much ignorance , generally , amongst them with respect to all household knowledge , there will be opportunities for advising and instructing them , in a pleasant and unobtrusive manner , in cleanliness , industry , cookery , and good management . 15 . IN MARKETING , THAT THE BEST ARTICLES ARE THE CHEAPEST , may be laid down as a rule ; and it is desirable , unless an experienced and confidential housekeeper be kept , that the mistress should herself purchase all provisions and stores needed for the house . If the mistress be a young wife , and not accustomed to order " things for the house , " a little practice and experience will soon teach her who are the best tradespeople to deal with , and what are the best provisions to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ POULTRY , GAME , &c.,; will be described the proper means of ascertaining the quality of these comestibles. 16 . A HOUSEKEEPING ACCOUNT-BOOK should invariably be kept , and kept punctually and precisely . The plan for keeping household accounts , which we should recommend , would be to make an entry , that is , write down into a daily diary every amount paid on that particular day , be it ever so small ; then , at the end of the month , let these various payments be ranged under their specific heads of Butcher , Baker , &c.; and thus will be seen the proportions paid to each tradesman , and any one month 's expenses may be contrasted with another . The housekeeping accounts should be balanced not less than once a month ; so that you may see that the money you have in hand tallies with your account of it in your diary . Judge Haliburton never wrote truer words than when he said , " No man is rich whose expenditure exceeds his means , and no one is poor whose incomings exceed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a housekeeper is kept , it will be advisable for the mistress to examine her accounts regularly . Then any increase of expenditure which may be apparent , can easily be explained , and the housekeeper will have the satisfaction of knowing whether her efforts to manage her department well and economically , have been successful . 17 . ENGAGING DOMESTICS is one of those duties in which the judgment of the mistress must be keenly exercised . There are some respectable registry-offices , where good servants may sometimes be hired ; but the plan rather to be recommended is , for the mistress to make inquiry amongst her circle of friends and acquaintances , and her tradespeople . The latter generally know those in their neighbourhood , who are wanting situations , and will communicate with them , when a personal interview with some of them will enable the mistress to form some idea of the characters of the applicants , and to suit herself accordingly . We would here point out an error  --  and a grave one it is  --  into which some mistresses fall . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the duties which she will be expected to perform . This is an act of omission severely to be reprehended . Every portion of work which the maid will have to do , should be plainly stated by the mistress , and understood by the servant . If this plan is not carefully adhered to , domestic contention is almost certain to ensue , and this may not be easily settled ; so that a change of servants , which is so much to be deprecated , is continually occurring . 18 . IN OBTAINING A SERVANT 'S CHARACTER , it is not well to be guided by a written one from some unknown quarter ; but it is better to have an interview , if at all possible , with the former mistress . By this means you will be assisted in your decision of the suitableness of the servant for your place , from the appearance of the lady and the state of her house . Negligence and want of cleanliness in her and her household generally , will naturally lead you to the conclusion , that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The proper course to pursue in order to obtain a personal interview with the lady is this :  --  The servant in search of the situation must be desired to see her former mistress , and ask her to be kind enough to appoint a time , convenient to herself , when you may call on her ; this proper observance of courtesy being necessary to prevent any unseasonable intrusion on the part of a stranger . Your first questions should be relative to the honesty and general morality of her former servant ; and if no objection is stated in that respect , her other qualifications are then to be ascertained . Inquiries should be very minute , so that you may avoid disappointment and trouble , by knowing the weak points of your domestic . 19 . THE TREATMENT OF SERVANTS is of the highest possible moment , as well to the mistress as to the domestics themselves . On the head of the house the latter will naturally fix their attention ; and if they perceive that the mistress 's conduct is regulated by high and correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If , also , a benevolent desire is shown to promote their comfort , at the same time that a steady performance of their duty is exacted , then their respect will not be unmingled with affection , and they will be still more solicitous to continue to deserve her favour . 20 . IN GIVING A CHARACTER , it is scarcely necessary to say that the mistress should be guided by a sense of strict justice . It is not fair for one lady to recommend to another , a servant she would not keep herself . The benefit , too , to the servant herself is of small advantage ; for the failings which she possesses will increase if suffered to be indulged with impunity . It is hardly necessary to remark , on the other hand , that no angry feelings on the part of a mistress towards her late servant , should ever be allowed , in the slightest degree , to influence her , so far as to induce her to disparage her maid 's character . 21 . THE FOLLOWING TABLE OF THE AVERAGE YEARLY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the household placed in the order in which they are usually ranked , will serve as a guide to regulate the expenditure of an establishment :  --  When not found in When found in Livery . Livery . The House Steward From L10 to L80  - -  The Valet " 25 to 50 From L20 to L30 The Butler " 25 to 50  - -  The Cook " 20 to 40  - -  The Gardener " 20 to 40  - -  The Footman " 20 to 40 " 15 to 25 The Under Butler " 15 to 30 " 15 to 25 The Coachman  --  " 20 to 35 The Groom " 15 to 30 " 12 to 20 The Under Footman  --  " 12 to 20 The Page or Footboy " 8 to 18 " 6 to 14 The Stableboy " 6 to 12  --  When no extra When an extra allowance is made for allowance is made for Tea , Sugar , and Beer . Tea , Sugar , and Beer .

All the domestics mentioned in the above table would enter into the establishment of a wealthy nobleman . The number of servants , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the establishment ; and we may here enumerate a scale of servants suited to various incomes , commencing with  --  About L1,000 a year  --  A cook , upper housemaid , nursemaid , under housemaid , and a man servant . About L750 a year  --  A cook , housemaid , nursemaid , and footboy . About L500 a year  --  A cook , housemaid , and nursemaid . About L300 a year  --  A maid-of-all-work and nursemaid . About L200 or L150 a year  --  A maid-of-all-work ( and girl occasionally ) . 22 . HAVING THUS INDICATED some of the more general duties of the mistress , relative to the moral government of her household , we will now give a few specific instructions on matters having a more practical relation to the position which she is supposed to occupy in the eye of the world . To do this the more clearly , we will begin with her earliest duties , and take her completely through the occupations of a day . 23 . HAVING RISEN EARLY , as we have already advised ( see 3 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a careful toilet , it will be well at once to see that the children have received their proper ablutions , and are in every way clean and comfortable . The first meal of the day , breakfast , will then be served , at which all the family should be punctually present , unless illness , or other circumstances , prevent . 24 . AFTER BREAKFAST IS OVER , it will be well for the mistress to make a round of the kitchen and other offices , to see that all are in order , and that the morning 's work has been properly performed by the various domestics . The orders for the day should then be given , and any questions which the domestics desire to ask , respecting their several departments , should be answered , and any special articles they may require , handed to them from the store-closet . In those establishments where there is a housekeeper , it will not be so necessary for the mistress , personally , to perform the above-named duties . 25 . AFTER THIS GENERAL SUPERINTENDENCE of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young family , may devote herself to the instruction of some of its younger members , or to the examination of the state of their wardrobe , leaving the later portion of the morning for reading , or for some amusing recreation . " Recreation , " says Bishop Hall , " is intended to the mind as whetting is to the scythe , to sharpen the edge of it , which would otherwise grow dull and blunt . He , therefore , that spends his whole time in recreation is ever whetting , never mowing ; his grass may grow and his steed starve ; as , contrarily , he that always toils and never recreates , is ever mowing , never whetting , labouring much to little purpose . As good no scythe as no edge . Then only doth the work go forward , when the scythe is so seasonably and moderately whetted that it may cut , and so cut , that it may have the help of sharpening . " Unless the means of the mistress be very circumscribed , and she be obliged to devote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her children 's clothes , and other economical pursuits , it is right that she should give some time to the pleasures of literature , the innocent delights of the garden , and to the improvement of any special abilities for music , painting , and other elegant arts , which she may , happily , possess . 26 . THESE DUTIES AND PLEASURES BEING PERFORMED AND ENJOYED , the hour of luncheon will have arrived . This is a very necessary meal between an early breakfast and a late dinner , as a healthy person , with good exercise , should have a fresh supply of food once in four hours . It should be a light meal ; but its solidity must , of course , be , in some degree , proportionate to the time it is intended to enable you to wait for your dinner , and the amount of exercise you take in the mean time . At this time , also , the servants ' dinner will be served . In those establishments where an early dinner is served , that will , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , where a nursery dinner is provided for the children and about one o'clock , the mistress and the elder portion of the family make their luncheon at the same time from the same joint , or whatever may be provided . A mistress will arrange , according to circumstances , the serving of the meal ; but the more usual plan is for the lady of the house to have the joint brought to her table , and afterwards carried to the nursery . 27 . AFTER LUNCHEON , MORNING CALLS AND VISITS may be made and received . These may be divided under three heads : those of ceremony , friendship , and congratulation or condolence . Visits of ceremony , or courtesy , which occasionally merge into those of friendship , are to be paid under various circumstances . Thus , they are uniformly required after dining at a friend 's house , or after a ball , picnic , or any other party . These visits should be short , a stay of from fifteen to twenty minutes being quite sufficient . A lady paying a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shawl nor bonnet . When other visitors are announced , it is well to retire as soon as possible , taking care to let it appear that their arrival is not the cause . When they are quietly seated , and the bustle of their entrance is over , rise from your chair , taking a kind leave of the hostess , and bowing politely to the guests . Should you call at an inconvenient time , not having ascertained the luncheon hour , or from any other inadvertence , retire as soon as possible , without , however , showing that you feel yourself an intruder . It is not difficult for any well-bred or even good-tempered person , to know what to say on such an occasion , and , on politely withdrawing , a promise can be made to call again , if the lady you have called on , appear really disappointed . 28 . IN PAYING VISITS OF FRIENDSHIP , it will not be so necessary to be guided by etiquette as in paying visits of ceremony ; and if a lady be pressed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done if it will not interfere with her subsequent arrangements . It is , however , requisite to call at suitable times , and to avoid staying too long , if your friend is engaged . The courtesies of society should ever be maintained , even in the domestic circle , and amongst the nearest friends . During these visits , the manners should be easy and cheerful , and the subjects of conversation such as may be readily terminated . Serious discussions or arguments are to be altogether avoided , and there is much danger and impropriety in expressing opinions of those persons and characters with whom , perhaps , there is but a slight acquaintance . ( See 6 , 7 , and 9 . ) It is not advisable , at any time , to take favourite dogs into another lady 's drawing-room , for many persons have an absolute dislike to such animals ; and besides this , there is always a chance of a breakage of some article occurring , through their leaping and bounding here and there , sometimes very much to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also , unless they are particularly well-trained and orderly , and she is on exceedingly friendly terms with the hostess , should not accompany a lady in making morning calls . Where a lady , however , pays her visits in a carriage , the children can be taken in the vehicle , and remain in it until the visit is over . 29 . FOR MORNING CALLS , it is well to be neatly attired ; for a costume very different to that you generally wear , or anything approaching an evening dress , will be very much out of place . As a general rule , it may be said , both in reference to this and all other occasions , it is better to be under-dressed than over-dressed . A strict account should be kept of ceremonial visits , and notice how soon your visits have been returned . An opinion may thus be formed as to whether your frequent visits are , or are not , desirable . There are , naturally , instances when the circumstances of old age or ill health will preclude any return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must not interrupt the discharge of the duty . 30 . IN PAYING VISITS OF CONDOLENCE , it is to be remembered that they should be paid within a week after the event which occasions them . If the acquaintance , however , is but slight , then immediately after the family has appeared at public worship . A lady should send in her card , and if her friends be able to receive her , the visitor 's manner and conversation should be subdued and in harmony with the character of her visit . Courtesy would dictate that a mourning card should be used , and that visitors , in paying condoling visits , should be dressed in black , either silk or plain-coloured apparel . Sympathy with the affliction of the family , is thus expressed , and these attentions are , in such cases , pleasing and soothing . In all these visits , if your acquaintance or friend be not at home , a card should be left . If in a carriage , the servant will answer your inquiry and receive your card ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the servant in the hall , but leave to go in and rest should on no account be asked . The form of words , " Not at home , " may be understood in different senses ; but the only courteous way is to receive them as being perfectly true . You may imagine that the lady of the house is really at home , and that she would make an exception in your favour , or you may think that your acquaintance is not desired ; but , in either case , not the slightest word is to escape you , which would suggest , on your part , such an impression . 31 . IN RECEIVING MORNING CALLS , the foregoing description of the etiquette to be observed in paying them , will be of considerable service . It is to be added , however , that the occupations of drawing , music , or reading should be suspended on the entrance of morning visitors . If a lady , however , be engaged with light needlework , and none other is appropriate in the drawing-room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with good breeding to quietly continue it during conversation , particularly if the visit be protracted , or the visitors be gentlemen . Formerly the custom was to accompany all visitors quitting the house to the door , and there take leave of them ; but modern society , which has thrown off a great deal of this kind of ceremony , now merely requires that the lady of the house should rise from her seat , shake hands , or courtesy , in accordance with the intimacy she has with her guests , and ring the bell to summon the servant to attend them and open the door . In making a first call , either upon a newly-married couple , or persons newly arrived in the neighbourhood , a lady should leave her husband 's card together with her own , at the same time , stating that the profession or business in which he is engaged has prevented him from having the pleasure of paying the visit , with her . It is a custom with many ladies , when on the eve of an absence from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cards , with the letters P. P. C. in the right-hand corner . These letters are the initials of the French words , " Pour prendre conge , " meaning , " To take leave . " 32 . THE MORNING CALLS BEING PAID OR RECEIVED , and their etiquette properly attended to , the next great event of the day in most establishments is " The Dinner ; " and we only propose here to make a few general remarks on this important topic , as , in future pages , the whole " Art of Dining " will be thoroughly considered , with reference to its economy , comfort , and enjoyment . 33 . IN GIVING OR ACCEPTING AN INVITATION FOR DINNER , the following is the form of words generally made use of . They , however , can be varied in proportion to the intimacy or position of the hosts and guests :  --  Mr. and Mrs. A  --   --  present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. B  --   --  , and request the honour , or hope to have the pleasure of their company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A  --   --  STREET , November 13th , 1859 . R. S. V. P. The letters in the corner imply " Repondez , s'il vous plait ; " meaning , " an answer will oblige . " The reply , accepting the invitation , is couched in the following terms :  --  Mr. and Mrs. B  --   --  present their compliments to Mr. and Mrs. A  --  - , and will do themselves the honour of , or will have much pleasure in accepting their kind invitation to dinner on the 6th of December next . B  --   --  SQUARE , November 18th , 1859 . Cards , or invitations for a dinner-party , should be issued a fortnight or three weeks ( sometimes even a month ) beforehand , and care should be taken by the hostess , in the selection of the invited guests , that they should be suited to each other . Much also of the pleasure of a dinner-party will depend on the arrangement of the guests at table , so as to form a due admixture of talkers and listeners , the grave and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guests should be punctual , and the mistress ready in her drawing-room to receive them . At some periods it has been considered fashionable to come late to dinner , but lately nous avons change tout cela. 34 . THE HALF-HOUR BEFORE DINNER has always been considered as the great ordeal through which the mistress , in giving a dinner-party , will either pass with flying colours , or , lose many of her laurels . The anxiety to receive her guests ,  --  her hope that all will be present in due time ,  --  her trust in the skill of her cook , and the attention of the other domestics , all tend to make these few minutes a trying time . The mistress , however , must display no kind of agitation , but show her tact in suggesting light and cheerful subjects of conversation , which will be much aided by the introduction of any particular new book , curiosity of art , or article of vertu , which may pleasantly engage the attention of the company . " Waiting for Dinner , " however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who have not felt  --  " How sad it is to sit and pine , The long half-hour before we dine ! Upon our watches oft to look , Then wonder at the clock and cook , * * * * * " And strive to laugh in spite of Fate ! But laughter forced soon quits the room , And leaves it in its former gloom . But lo ! the dinner now appears , The object of our hopes and fears , The end of all our pain ! " In giving an entertainment of this kind , the mistress should remember that it is her duty to make her guests feel happy , comfortable , and quite at their ease ; and the guests should also consider that they have come to the house of their hostess to be happy . Thus an opportunity is given to all for innocent enjoyment and intellectual improvement , when also acquaintances may be formed that may prove invaluable through life , and information gained that will enlarge the mind . Many celebrated men and women have been great talkers ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who spoke freely to every one , and a favourite remark of whom it was , that he never did so without learning something he did n't know before . 35 . DINNER BEING ANNOUNCED , the host offers his arm to , and places on his right hand at the dinner-table , the lady to whom he desires to pay most respect , either on account of her age , position , or from her being the greatest stranger in the party . If this lady be married and her husband present , the latter takes the hostess to her place at table , and seats himself at her right hand . The rest of the company follow in couples , as specified by the master and mistress of the house , arranging the party according to their rank and other circumstances which may be known to the host and hostess . It will be found of great assistance to the placing of a party at the dinner-table , to have the names of the guests neatly ( and correctly ) written on small cards , and placed at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit . With respect to the number of guests , it has often been said , that a private dinner-party should consist of not less than the number of the Graces , or more than that of the Muses . A party of ten or twelve is , perhaps , in a general way , sufficient to enjoy themselves and be enjoyed . White kid gloves are worn by ladies at dinner-parties , but should be taken off before the business of dining commences . 36 . THE GUESTS BEING SEATED AT THE DINNER-TABLE , the lady begins to help the soup , which is handed round , commencing with the gentleman on her right and on her left , and continuing in the same order till all are served . It is generally established as a rule , not to ask for soup or fish twice , as , in so doing , part of the company may be kept waiting too long for the second course , when , perhaps , a little revenge is taken by looking at the awkward consumer of a second portion . This rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered as binding . It is not usual , where taking wine is en regle , for a gentleman to ask a lady to take wine until the fish or soup is finished , and then the gentleman honoured by sitting on the right of the hostess , may politely inquire if she will do him the honour of taking wine with him . This will act as a signal to the rest of the company , the gentleman of the house most probably requesting the same pleasure of the ladies at his right and left . At many tables , however , the custom or fashion of drinking wine in this manner , is abolished , and the servant fills the glasses of the guests with the various wines suited to the course which is in progress . 37 . WHEN DINNER IS FINISHED , THE DESSERT is placed on the table , accompanied with finger-glasses . It is the custom of some gentlemen to wet a corner of the napkin ; but the hostess , whose behaviour will set the tone to all the ladies present , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve all the purposes required . The French and other continentals have a habit of gargling the mouth ; but it is a custom which no English gentlewoman should , in the slightest degree , imitate . 38 . WHEN FRUIT HAS BEEN TAKEN , and a glass or two of wine passed round , the time will have arrived when the hostess will rise , and thus give the signal for the ladies to leave the gentlemen , and retire to the drawing-room . The gentlemen of the party will rise at the same time , and he who is nearest the door , will open it for the ladies , all remaining courteously standing until the last lady has withdrawn . Dr. Johnson has a curious paragraph on the effects of a dinner on men . " Before dinner , " he says , " men meet with great inequality of understanding ; and those who are conscious of their inferiority have the modesty not to talk . When they have drunk wine , every man feels himself happy , and loses that modesty , and grows impudent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only not sensible of his defects . " This is rather severe , but there may be truth in it . In former times , when the bottle circulated freely amongst the guests , it was necessary for the ladies to retire earlier than they do at present , for the gentlemen of the company soon became unfit to conduct themselves with that decorum which is essential in the presence of ladies . Thanks , however , to the improvements in modern society , and the high example shown to the nation by its most illustrious personages , temperance is , in these happy days , a striking feature in the character of a gentleman . Delicacy of conduct towards the female sex has increased with the esteem in which they are now universally held , and thus , the very early withdrawing of the ladies from the dining-room is to be deprecated . A lull in the conversation will seasonably indicate the moment for the ladies ' departure . 39 . AFTER-DINNER INVITATIONS MAY BE GIVEN ; by which we wish to be understood , invitations for the evening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to their engagements , or sometimes will be varied in obedience to the caprices of fashion . Guests invited for the evening are , however , generally considered at liberty to arrive whenever it will best suit themselves ,  --  usually between nine and twelve , unless earlier hours are specifically named . By this arrangement , many fashionable people and others , who have numerous engagements to fulfil , often contrive to make their appearance at two or three parties in the course of one evening . 40 . THE ETIQUETTE OF THE DINNER-PARTY TABLE being disposed of , let us now enter slightly into that of an evening party or ball . The invitations issued and accepted for either of these , will be written in the same style as those already described for a dinner-party . They should be sent out at least three weeks before the day fixed for the event , and should be replied to within a week of their receipt . By attending to these courtesies , the guests will have time to consider their engagements and prepare their dresses , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of her party . If the entertainment is to be simply an evening party , this must be specified on the card or note of invitation . Short or verbal invitations , except where persons are exceedingly intimate , or are very near relations , are very far from proper , although , of course , in this respect and in many other respects , very much always depends on the manner in which the invitation is given . True politeness , however , should be studied even amongst the nearest friends and relations ; for the mechanical forms of good breeding are of great consequence , and too much familiarity may have , for its effect , the destruction of friendship . 41 . AS THE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN ARRIVE , each should be shown to a room exclusively provided for their reception ; and in that set apart for the ladies , attendants should be in waiting to assist in uncloaking , and helping to arrange the hair and toilet of those who require it . It will be found convenient , in those cases where the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that they can be attached to the cloaks and shawls of each lady , a duplicate of which should be handed to the guest . Coffee is sometimes provided in this , or an ante-room , for those who would like to partake of it . 42 . AS THE VISITORS ARE ANNOUNCED BY THE SERVANT , it is not necessary for the lady of the house to advance each time towards the door , but merely to rise from her seat to receive their courtesies and congratulations . If , indeed , the hostess wishes to show particular favour to some peculiarly honoured guests , she may introduce them to others , whose acquaintance she may imagine will be especially suitable and agreeable . It is very often the practice of the master of the house to introduce one gentleman to another , but occasionally the lady performs this office ; when it will , of course , be polite for the persons thus introduced to take their seats together for the time being . The custom of non-introduction is very much in vogue in many houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and qualities of the people around them . The servant , indeed , calls out the names of all the visitors as they arrive , but , in many instances , mispronounces them ; so that it will not be well to follow this information , as if it were an unerring guide . In our opinion , it is a cheerless and depressing custom , although , in thus speaking , we do not allude to the large assemblies of the aristocracy , but to the smaller parties of the middle classes . 43 . A SEPARATE ROOM OR CONVENIENT BUFFET should be appropriated for refreshments , and to which the dancers may retire ; and cakes and biscuits , with wine negus , lemonade , and ices , handed round . A supper is also mostly provided at the private parties of the middle classes ; and this requires , on the part of the hostess , a great deal of attention and supervision . It usually takes place between the first and second parts of the programme of the dances , of which there should be several prettily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private parties , a lady is not to refuse the invitation of a gentleman to dance , unless she be previously engaged . The hostess must he supposed to have asked to her house only those persons whom she knows to be perfectly respectable and of unblemished character , as well as pretty equal in position ; and thus , to decline the offer of any gentleman present , would be a tacit reflection on the master and mistress of the house . It may be mentioned here , more especially for the young who will read this book , that introductions at balls or evening parties , cease with the occasion that calls them forth , no introduction , at these times , giving a gentleman a right to address , afterwards , a lady . She is , consequently , free , next morning , to pass her partner at a ball of the previous evening without the slightest recognition . 44 . THE BALL IS GENERALLY OPENED , that is , the first place in the first quadrille is occupied , by the lady of the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the dance with the lady who is either the highest in rank , or the greatest stranger . It will be well for the hostess , even if she be very partial to the amusement , and a graceful dancer , not to participate in it to any great extent , lest her lady guests should have occasion to complain of her monopoly of the gentlemen , and other causes of neglect . A few dances will suffice to show her interest in the entertainment , without unduly trenching on the attention due to her guests . In all its parts a ball should be perfect ,  --  " The music , and the banquet , and the wine ; The garlands , the rose-odours , and the flowers . " The hostess or host , during the progress of a ball , will courteously accost and chat with their friends , and take care that the ladies are furnished with seats , and that those who wish to dance are provided with partners . A gentle hint from the hostess , conveyed in a quiet ladylike manner , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure not to be neglected by any gentleman . Thus will be studied the comfort and enjoyment of the guests , and no lady , in leaving the house , will be able to feel the chagrin and disappointment of not having been invited to " stand up " in a dance during the whole of the evening . 45 . WHEN ANY OF THE CARRIAGES OF THE GUESTS ARE ANNOUNCED , or the time for their departure arrived , they should make a slight intimation to the hostess , without , however , exciting any observation , that they are about to depart . If this can not be done , however , without creating too much bustle , it will be better for the visitors to retire quietly without taking their leave . During the course of the week , the hostess will expect to receive from every guest a call , where it is possible , or cards expressing the gratification experienced from her entertainment . This attention is due to every lady for the pains and trouble she has been at , and tends to promote social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties of pleasure , it will be an interesting change to return to the more domestic business of the house , although all the details we have been giving of dinner-parties , balls , and the like , appertain to the department of the mistress . Without a knowledge of the etiquette to be observed on these occasions , a mistress would be unable to enjoy and appreciate those friendly pleasant meetings which give , as it were , a fillip to life , and make the quiet happy home of an English gentlewoman appear the more delightful and enjoyable . In their proper places , all that is necessary to be known respecting the dishes and appearance of the breakfast , dinner , tea , and supper tables , will be set forth in this work . 47 . A FAMILY DINNER AT HOME , compared with either giving or going to a dinner-party , is , of course , of much more frequent occurrence , and many will say , of much greater importance . Both , however , have to be considered with a view to their nicety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to economy . These points will be especially noted in the following pages on " Household Cookery . " Here we will only say , that for both mistress and servants , as well in large as small households , it will be found , by far , the better plan , to cook and serve the dinner , and to lay the tablecloth and the sideboard , with the same cleanliness , neatness , and scrupulous exactness , whether it be for the mistress herself alone , a small family , or for " company . " If this rule be strictly adhered to , all will find themselves increase in managing skill ; whilst a knowledge of their daily duties will become familiar , and enable them to meet difficult occasions with ease , and overcome any amount of obstacles . 48 . OF THE MANNER OF PASSING EVENINGS AT HOME , there is none pleasanter than in such recreative enjoyments as those which relax the mind from its severer duties , whilst they stimulate it with a gentle delight . Where there are young people forming a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially be promoted . It is of incalculable benefit to them that their homes should possess all the attractions of healthful amusement , comfort , and happiness ; for if they do not find pleasure there , they will seek it elsewhere . It ought , therefore , to enter into the domestic policy of every parent , to make her children feel that home is the happiest place in the world ; that to imbue them with this delicious home-feeling is one of the choicest gifts a parent can bestow . Light or fancy needlework often forms a portion of the evening 's recreation for the ladies of the household , and this may be varied by an occasional game at chess or backgammon . It has often been remarked , too , that nothing is more delightful to the feminine members of a family , than the reading aloud of some good standard work or amusing publication . A knowledge of polite literature may be thus obtained by the whole family , especially if the reader is able and willing to explain the more difficult passages of the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain . This plan , in a great measure , realizes the advice of Lord Bacon , who says , " Read not to contradict and refute , nor to believe and take for granted , nor to find talk and discourse , but to weigh and consider . " 49 . IN RETIRING FOR THE NIGHT , it is well to remember that early rising is almost impossible , if late going to bed be the order , or rather disorder , of the house . The younger members of a family should go early and at regular hours to their beds , and the domestics as soon as possible after a reasonably appointed hour . Either the master or the mistress of a house should , after all have gone to their separate rooms , see that all is right with respect to the lights and fires below ; and no servants should , on any account , be allowed to remain up after the heads of the house have retired . 50 . HAVING THUS GONE FROM EARLY RISING TO EARLY RETIRING , there remain only now to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house will be glad to receive some specific information . 51 . WHEN A MISTRESS TAKES A HOUSE in a new locality , it will be etiquette for her to wait until the older inhabitants of the neighbourhood call upon her ; thus evincing a desire , on their part , to become acquainted with the new comer . It may be , that the mistress will desire an intimate acquaintance with but few of her neighbours ; but it is to be specially borne in mind that all visits , whether of ceremony , friendship , or condolence , should be punctiliously returned . 52 . YOU MAY PERHAPS HAVE BEEN FAVOURED with letters of introduction from some of your friends , to persons living in the neighbourhood to which you have just come . In this case inclose the letter of introduction in an envelope with your card . Then , if the person , to whom it is addressed , calls in the course of a few days , the visit should be returned by you within the week , if possible . Any breach of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excused . In the event of your being invited to dinner under the above circumstances , nothing but necessity should prevent you from accepting the invitation . If , however , there is some distinct reason why you can not accept , let it be stated frankly and plainly , for politeness and truthfulness should be ever allied . An opportunity should , also , be taken to call in the course of a day or two , in order to politely express your regret and disappointment at not having been able to avail yourself of their kindness . 53 . IN GIVING A LETTER OF INTRODUCTION , it should always be handed to your friend , unsealed . Courtesy dictates this , as the person whom you are introducing would , perhaps , wish to know in what manner he or she was spoken of . Should you receive a letter from a friend , introducing to you any person known to and esteemed by the writer , the letter should be immediately acknowledged , and your willingness expressed to do all in your power to carry out his or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which enter into the position of the mistress of a house , and such are , happily , with a slight but continued attention , of by no means difficult performance . She ought always to remember that she is the first and the last , the Alpha and the Omega in the government of her establishment ; and that it is by her conduct that its whole internal policy is regulated . She is , therefore , a person of far more importance in a community than she usually thinks she is . On her pattern her daughters model themselves ; by her counsels they are directed ; through her virtues all are honoured ;  --  " her children rise up and call her blessed ; her husband , also , and he praiseth her . " Therefore , let each mistress always remember her responsible position , never approving a mean action , nor speaking an unrefined word . Let her conduct be such that her inferiors may respect her , and such as an honourable and right-minded man may look for in his wife and the mother of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sincere homage that have been paid to her sex by the greatest philosophers and writers , both in ancient and modern times . Let her not forget that she has to show herself worthy of Campbell 's compliment when he said ,  --  " The world was sad ! the garden was a wild ! And man the hermit sigh 'd , till woman smiled . " Let her prove herself , then , the happy companion of man , and able to take unto herself the praises of the pious prelate , Jeremy Taylor , who says ,  --  " A good wife is Heaven 's last best gift to man ,  --  his angel and minister of graces innumerable ,  --  his gem of many virtues ,  --  his casket of jewels  --  her voice is sweet music  --  her smiles his brightest day ;  --  her kiss , the guardian of his innocence ;  --  her arms , the pale of his safety , the balm of his health , the balsam of his life ;  --  her industry , his surest wealth ;  --  her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faithful counsellors ;  --  her bosom , the softest pillow of his cares ; and her prayers , the ablest advocates of Heaven 's blessings on his head . " Cherishing , then , in her breast the respected utterances of the good and the great , let the mistress of every house rise to the responsibility of its management ; so that , in doing her duty to all around her , she may receive the genuine reward of respect , love , and affection ! Note .  --  Many mistresses have experienced the horrors of house-hunting , and it is well known that " three removes are as good ( or bad , rather ) as a fire . " Nevertheless , it being quite evident that we must , in these days at least , live in houses , and are sometimes obliged to change our residences , it is well to consider some of the conditions which will add to , or diminish , the convenience and comfort of our homes . Although the choice of a house must be dependent on so many different circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this head would be impossible and useless ; yet it will be advantageous , perhaps , to many , if we point out some of those general features as to locality , soil , aspect , &c.,; to which the attention of all house-takers should be carefully directed . Regarding the locality , we may say , speaking now more particularly of a town house , that it is very important to the health and comfort of a family , that the neighbourhood of all factories of any kind , producing unwholesome effluvia or smells , should be strictly avoided . Neither is it well to take a house in the immediate vicinity of where a noisy trade is carried on , as it is unpleasant to the feelings , and tends to increase any existing irritation of the system . Referring to soils ; it is held as a rule , that a gravel soil is superior to any other , as the rain drains through it very quickly , and it is consequently drier and less damp than clay , upon which water rests a far longer time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant for walking exercise as one in which gravel predominates . The aspect of the house should be well considered , and it should be borne in mind that the more sunlight that comes into the house , the healthier is the habitation . The close , fetid smell which assails one on entering a narrow court , or street , in towns , is to be assigned to the want of light , and , consequently , air . A house with a south or south-west aspect , is lighter , warmer , drier , and consequently more healthy , than one facing the north or north-east . Great advances have been made , during the last few years , in the principles of sanitary knowledge , and one most essential point to be observed in reference to a house , is its " drainage , " as it has been proved in an endless number of cases , that bad or defective drainage is as certain to destroy health as the taking of poisons . This arises from its injuriously affecting the atmosphere ; thus rendering the air we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , then , that unless a house is effectually drained , the health of its inhabitants is sure to suffer ; and they will be susceptible of ague , rheumatism , diarrhoea , fevers , and cholera . We now come to an all-important point ,  --  that of the water supply . The value of this necessary article has also been lately more and more recognized in connection with the question of health and life ; and most houses are well supplied with every convenience connected with water . Let it , however , be well understood , that no house , however suitable in other respects , can be desirable , if this grand means of health and comfort is , in the slightest degree , scarce or impure . No caution can be too great to see that it is pure and good , as well as plentiful ; for , knowing , as we do , that not a single part of our daily food is prepared without it , the importance of its influence on the health of the inmates of a house can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be overlooked . In a general way , enough of air is admitted by the cracks round the doors and windows ; but if this be not the case , the chimney will smoke ; and other plans , such as the placing of a plate of finely-perforated zinc in the upper part of the window , must be used . Cold air should never be admitted under the doors , or at the bottom of a room , unless it be close to the fire or stove ; for it will flow along the floor towards the fireplace , and thus leave the foul air in the upper part of the room , unpurified , cooling , at the same time , unpleasantly and injuriously , the feet and legs of the inmates . The rent of a house , it has been said , should not exceed one-eighth of the whole income of its occupier ; and , as a general rule , we are disposed to assent to this estimate , although there may be many circumstances which would not admit of its being considered infallible . Illustration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN COMMAND IN THE HOUSE , except in large establishments , where there is a house steward , the housekeeper must consider herself as the immediate representative of her mistress , and bring , to the management of the household , all those qualities of honesty , industry , and vigilance , in the same degree as if she were at the head of her own family . Constantly on the watch to detect any wrong-doing on the part of any of the domestics , she will overlook all that goes on in the house , and will see that every department is thoroughly attended to , and that the servants are comfortable , at the same time that their various duties are properly performed . Cleanliness , punctuality , order , and method , are essentials in the character of a good housekeeper . Without the first , no household can be said to be well managed . The second is equally all-important ; for those who are under the housekeeper will take their " cue " from her ; and in the same proportion as punctuality governs her movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is indispensable ; for by it we wish to be understood that " there should be a place for everything , and everything in its place . " Method , too , is most necessary ; for when the work is properly contrived , and each part arranged in regular succession , it will be done more quickly and more effectually. 56 . A NECESSARY QUALIFICATION FOR A HOUSEKEEPER is , that she should thoroughly understand accounts . She will have to write in her books an accurate registry of all sums paid for any and every purpose , all the current expenses of the house , tradesmen 's bills , and other extraneous matter . As we have mentioned under the head of the Mistress ( see 16 ) , a housekeeper 's accounts should be periodically balanced , and examined by the head of the house . Nothing tends more to the satisfaction of both employer and employed , than this arrangement . " Short reckonings make long friends , " stands good in this case , as in others . It will be found an excellent plan to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house connected with housekeeping , and is not paid for at the time . The book containing these entries can then be compared with the bills sent in by the various tradesmen , so that any discrepancy can be inquired into and set right . An intelligent housekeeper will , by this means , too , be better able to judge of the average consumption of each article by the household ; and if that quantity be , at any time , exceeded , the cause may be discovered and rectified , if it proceed from waste or carelessness . 57 . ALTHOUGH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF THE COOK , the housekeeper does not generally much interfere , yet it is necessary that she should possess a good knowledge of the culinary art , as , in many instances , it may be requisite for her to take the superintendence of the kitchen . As a rule , it may be stated , that the housekeeper , in those establishments where there is no house steward or man cook , undertakes the preparation of the confectionary , attends to the preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general way , to the more difficult branches of the art of cookery . Much of these arrangements will depend , however , on the qualifications of the cook ; for instance , if she be an able artiste , there will be but little necessity for the housekeeper to interfere , except in the already noticed articles of confectionary , &c.; On the contrary , if the cook be not so clever an adept in her art , then it will be requisite for the housekeeper to give more of her attention to the business of the kitchen , than in the former case . It will be one of the duties of the housekeeper to attend to the marketing , in the absence of either a house steward or man cook . 58 . THE DAILY DUTIES OF A HOUSEKEEPER are regulated , in a great measure , by the extent of the establishment she superintends . She should , however , rise early , and see that all the domestics are duly performing their work , and that everything is progressing satisfactorily for the preparation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which , in large establishments , she will take in the " housekeeper 's room " with the lady's-maid , butler , and valet , and where they will be waited on by the still-room maid , she will , on various days set apart for each purpose , carefully examine the household linen , with a view to its being repaired , or to a further quantity being put in hand to be made ; she will also see that the furniture throughout the house is well rubbed and polished ; and will , besides , attend to all the necessary details of marketing and ordering goods from the tradesmen . The housekeeper 's room is generally made use of by the lady's-maid , butler , and valet , who take there their breakfast , tea , and supper . The lady's-maid will also use this apartment as a sitting-room , when not engaged with her lady , or with some other duties , which would call her elsewhere . In different establishments , according to their size and the rank of the family , different rules of course prevail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very high rank , and where there is a house steward , there are two distinct tables kept , one in the steward 's room for the principal members of the household , the other in the servants ' hall , for the other domestics . At the steward 's dinner-table , the steward and housekeeper preside ; and here , also , are present the lady's-maid , butler , valet , and head gardener . Should any visitors be staying with the family , their servants , generally the valet and lady's-maid , will be admitted to the steward 's table . 59 . AFTER DINNER , the housekeeper , having seen that all the members of the establishment have regularly returned to their various duties , and that all the departments of the household are in proper working order , will have many important matters claiming her attention . She will , possibly , have to give the finishing touch to some article of confectionary , or be occupied with some of the more elaborate processes of the still-room . There may also be the dessert to arrange , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no ordinary degree of care , taste , and attention . The still-room was formerly much more in vogue than at present ; for in days of " auld lang syne , " the still was in constant requisition for the supply of sweet-flavoured waters for the purposes of cookery , scents and aromatic substances used in the preparation of the toilet , and cordials in cases of accidents and illness . There are some establishments , however , in which distillation is still carried on , and in these , the still-room maid has her old duties to perform . In a general way , however , this domestic is immediately concerned with the housekeeper . For the latter she lights the fire , dusts her room , prepares the breakfast-table , and waits at the different meals taken in the housekeeper 's room ( see 58 ) . A still-room maid may learn a very great deal of useful knowledge from her intimate connection with the housekeeper , and if she be active and intelligent , may soon fit herself for a better position in the household . 60 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself with the necessary preparations for the next day 's duties . Numberless small , but still important arrangements , will have to be made , so that everything may move smoothly . At times , perhaps , attention will have to be paid to the breaking of lump-sugar , the stoning of raisins , the washing , cleansing , and drying of currants , &c.; The evening , too , is the best time for setting right her account of the expenditure , and duly writing a statement of moneys received and paid , and also for making memoranda of any articles she may require for her storeroom or other departments . Periodically , at some convenient time ,  --  for instance , quarterly or half-yearly , it is a good plan for the housekeeper to make an inventory of everything she has under her care , and compare this with the lists of a former period ; she will then be able to furnish a statement , if necessary , of the articles which , on account of time , breakage , loss , or other causes , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IN CONCLUDING THESE REMARKS on the duties of the housekeeper , we will briefly refer to the very great responsibility which attaches to her position . Like " Caesar 's wife , " she should be " above suspicion , " and her honesty and sobriety unquestionable ; for there are many temptations to which she is exposed . In a physical point of view , a housekeeper should be healthy and strong , and be particularly clean in her person , and her hands , although they may show a degree of roughness , from the nature of some of her employments , yet should have a nice inviting appearance . In her dealings with the various tradesmen , and in her behaviour to the domestics under her , the demeanour and conduct of the housekeeper should be such as , in neither case , to diminish , by an undue familiarity , her authority or influence . Note .  --  It will be useful for the mistress and housekeeper to know the best seasons for various occupations connected with Household Management ; and we , accordingly , subjoin a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the winter months , servants have much more to do , in consequence of the necessity there is to attend to the number of fires throughout the household , not much more than the ordinary every-day work can be attempted . In the summer , and when the absence of fires gives the domestics more leisure , then any extra work that is required , can be more easily performed . The spring is the usual period set apart for house-cleaning , and removing all the dust and dirt , which will necessarily , with the best of housewives , accumulate during the winter months , from the smoke of the coal , oil , gas , &c.; This season is also well adapted for washing and bleaching linen , &c.,; as , the weather , not being then too hot for the exertions necessary in washing counterpanes , blankets , and heavy things in general , the work is better and more easily done than in the intense heats of July , which month some recommend for these purposes . Winter curtains should be taken down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woollen cloths also carefully laid by . The former should be well shaken and brushed , and then pinned upon paper or linen , with camphor to preserve them from the moths . Furs , &c.,; will be preserved in the same way . Included , under the general description of house-cleaning , must be understood , turning out all the nooks and corners of drawers , cupboards , lumber-rooms , lofts , &c.,; with a view of getting rid of all unnecessary articles , which only create dirt and attract vermin ; sweeping of chimneys , taking up carpets , painting and whitewashing the kitchen and offices , papering rooms , when needed , and , generally speaking , the house putting on , with the approaching summer , a bright appearance , and a new face , in unison with nature . Oranges now should be preserved , and orange wine made . The summer will be found , as we have mentioned above , in consequence of the diminution of labour for the domestics , the best period for examining and repairing household linen , and for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large share of wear and tear during the dark winter days . In direct reference to this matter , we may here remark , that sheets should be turned " sides to middle " before they are allowed to get very thin . Otherwise , patching , which is uneconomical from the time it consumes , and is unsightly in point of appearance , will have to be resorted to . In June and July , gooseberries , currants , raspberries , strawberries , and other summer fruits , should be preserved , and jams and jellies made . In July , too , the making of walnut ketchup should be attended to , as the green walnuts will be approaching perfection for this purpose . Mixed pickles may also be now made , and it will be found a good plan to have ready a jar of pickle-juice ( for the making of which all information will be given in future pages ) , into which to put occasionally some young French beans , cauliflowers , &c.; In the early autumn , plums of various kinds are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little later , tomato sauce , a most useful article to have by you , may be prepared ; a supply of apples laid in , if you have a place to keep them , as also a few keeping pears and filberts . Endeavour to keep also a large vegetable marrow ,  --  it will be found delicious in the winter . In October and November , it will be necessary to prepare for the cold weather , and get ready the winter clothing for the various members of the family . The white summer curtains will now be carefully put away , the fireplaces , grates , and chimneys looked to , and the House put in a thorough state of repair , so that no " loose tile " may , at a future day , interfere with your comfort , and extract something considerable from your pocket . In December , the principal household duty lies in preparing for the creature comforts of those near and dear to us , so as to meet old Christmas with a happy face , a contented mind , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing the currants , cutting the citron , beating the eggs , and MIXING THE PUDDING , a housewife is not unworthily greeting the genial season of all good things . Illustration CHAPTER III . ARRANGEMENT AND ECONOMY OF THE KITCHEN . 62 . " THE DISTRIBUTION OF A KITCHEN , " says Count Rumford , the celebrated philosopher and physician , who wrote so learnedly on all subjects connected with domestic economy and architecture , " must always depend so much on local circumstances , that general rules can hardly be given respecting it ; the principles , however , on which this distribution ought , in all cases , to be made , are simple and easy to be understood , " and , in his estimation , these resolve themselves into symmetry of proportion in the building and convenience to the cook . The requisites of a good kitchen , however , demand something more special than is here pointed out . It must be remembered that it is the great laboratory of every household , and that much of the " weal or woe , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the preparations concocted within its walls . A good kitchen , therefore , should be erected with a view to the following particulars . 1 . Convenience of distribution in its parts , with largeness of dimension . 2 . Excellence of light , height of ceiling , and good ventilation . 3 . Easiness of access , without passing through the house . 4 . Sufficiently remote from the principal apartments of the house , that the members , visitors , or guests of the family , may not perceive the odour incident to cooking , or hear the noise of culinary operations . 5 . Plenty of fuel and water , which , with the scullery , pantry , and storeroom , should be so near it , as to offer the smallest possible trouble in reaching them . Illustration : Fig. 1 . The kitchens of the Middle Ages , in England , are said to have been constructed after the fashion of those of the Romans . They were generally octagonal , with several fireplaces , but no chimneys ; neither was there any wood admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , represents the turret which was erected on the top of the conical roof of the kitchen at Glastonbury Abbey , and which was perforated with holes to allow the smoke of the fire , as well as the steam from cooking , to escape . Some kitchens had funnels or vents below the eaves to let out the steam , which was sometimes considerable , as the Anglo-Saxons used their meat chiefly in a boiled state . From this circumstance , some of their large kitchens had four ranges , comprising a boiling-place for small boiled meats , and a boiling-house for the great boiler . In private houses the culinary arrangements were no doubt different ; for Du Cange mentions a little kitchen with a chamber , even in a solarium , or upper floor . 63 . THE SIMPLICITY OF THE PRIMITIVE AGES has frequently been an object of poetical admiration , and it delights the imagination to picture men living upon such fruits as spring spontaneously from the earth , and desiring no other beverages to slake their thirst , but such as fountains and rivers supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Argos lived principally on pears ; that the Arcadians revelled in acorns , and the Athenians in figs . This , of course , was in the golden age , before ploughing began , and when mankind enjoyed all kinds of plenty without having to earn their bread " by the sweat of their brow . " This delightful period , however , could not last for ever , and the earth became barren , and continued unfruitful till Ceres came and taught the art of sowing , with several other useful inventions . The first whom she taught to till the ground was Triptolemus , who communicated his instructions to his countrymen the Athenians . Thence the art was carried into Achaia , and thence into Arcadia . Barley was the first grain that was used , and the invention of bread-making is ascribed to Pan . The use of fire , as an instrument of cookery , must have been coeval with this invention of bread , which , being the most necessary of all kinds of food , was frequently used in a sense so comprehensive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Greeks , baked under the ashes . 64 . IN THE PRIMARY AGES it was deemed unlawful to eat flesh , and when mankind began to depart from their primitive habits , the flesh of swine was the first that was eaten . For several ages , it was pronounced unlawful to slaughter oxen , from an estimate of their great value in assisting men to cultivate the ground ; nor was it usual to kill young animals , from a sentiment which considered it cruel to take away the life of those that had scarcely tasted the joys of existence . At this period no cooks were kept , and we know from Homer that his ancient heroes prepared and dressed their victuals with their own hands . Ulysses , for example , we are told , like a modern charwoman , excelled at lighting a fire , whilst Achilles was an adept at turning a spit . Subsequently , heralds , employed in civil and military affairs , filled the office of cooks , and managed marriage feasts ; but this , no doubt , was after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step further than roasting , which , in all places , was the ancient manner of dressing meat . 65 . THE AGE OF ROASTING we may consider as that in which the use of the metals would be introduced as adjuncts to the culinary art ; and amongst these , iron , the most useful of them all , would necessarily take a prominent place . This metal is easily oxidized , but to bring it to a state of fusibility , it requires a most intense heat . Of all the metals , it is the widest diffused and most abundant ; and few stones or mineral bodies are without an admixture of it . It possesses the valuable property of being welded by hammering ; and hence its adaptation to the numerous purposes of civilized life . Metallic grains of iron have been found in strawberries , and a twelfth of the weight of the wood of dried oak is said to consist of this metal . Blood owes its colour of redness to the quantity of iron it contains , and rain and snow are seldom perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three states ,  --  as cast iron , wrought iron , and steel . In each of these it largely enters into the domestic economy , and stoves , grates , and the general implements of cookery , are usually composed of it . In antiquity , its employment was , comparatively speaking , equally universal . The excavations made at Pompeii have proved this . The accompanying cuts present us with specimens of stoves , both ancient and modern . Fig. 2 is the remains of a kitchen stove found in the house of Pansa , at Pompeii , and would seem , in its perfect state , not to have been materially different from such as are in use at the present day . Fig. 3 is a self-acting , simple open range in modern use , and may be had of two qualities , ranging , according to their dimensions , from L3. 10s. and L3. 18s. respectively , up to L4. 10s. and L7. 5s . They are completely fitted up with oven , boiler , sliding cheek , wrought-iron bars , revolving shelves , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leamington Kitchener , and is said to surpass any other range in use , for easy cooking by one fire . It has a hot plate , which is well calculated for an ironing-stove , and on which as many vessels as will stand upon it , may be kept boiling , without being either soiled or injured . Besides , it has a perfectly ventilated and spacious wrought-iron roaster , with movable shelves , draw-out stand , double dripping-pan , and meat-stand . The roaster can be converted into an oven by closing the valves , when bread and pastry can be baked in it in a superior manner . It also has a large iron boiler with brass tap and steam-pipe , round and square gridirons for chops and steaks , ash-pan , open fire for roasting , and a set of ornamental covings with plate-warmer attached . It took a first-class prize and medal in the Great Exhibition of 1851 , and was also exhibited , with all the recent improvements , at the Dublin Exhibition in 1853 . Fig. 5 is another kitchener , adapted for large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large ventilated oven ; and on the other , the fire and roaster . The hot plate is over all , and there is a back boiler , made of wrought iron , with brass tap and steam-pipe . In other respects it resembles Fig. 4 , with which it possesses similar advantages of construction . Either maybe had at varying prices , according to size , from L5. 15s. up to L23. 10s . They are supplied by Messrs . Richard &; John Slack 336 , Strand , London . Illustration : Fig. 2 . Illustration : Fig. 3 . Illustration : Fig. 4 . Illustration : Fig. 5. 66 . FROM KITCHEN RANGES to the implements used in cookery is but a step . With these , every kitchen should be well supplied , otherwise the cook must not be expected to " perform her office " in a satisfactory manner . Of the culinary utensils of the ancients , our knowledge is very limited ; but as the art of living , in every civilized country , is pretty much the same , the instruments for cooking must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . On referring to classical antiquities , we find mentioned , among household utensils , leather bags , baskets constructed of twigs , reeds , and rushes ; boxes , basins , and bellows ; bread-moulds , brooms , and brushes ; caldrons , colanders , cisterns , and chafing-dishes ; cheese-rasps , knives , and ovens of the Dutch kind ; funnels and frying-pans ; handmills , soup-ladles , milk-pails , and oil-jars ; presses , scales , and sieves ; spits of different sizes , but some of them large enough to roast an ox ; spoons , fire-tongs , trays , trenchers , and drinking-vessels ; with others for carrying food , preserving milk , and holding cheese . This enumeration , if it does nothing else , will , to some extent , indicate the state of the simpler kinds of mechanical arts among the ancients . Illustration : Fig. 6 . Illustration : Fig. 7 . Illustration : Fig. 8 . In so far as regards the shape and construction of many of the kitchen utensils enumerated above , they bore a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accompanying cuts . Fig. 6 is an ancient stock-pot in bronze , which seems to have been made to hang over the fire , and was found in the buried city of Pompeii . Fig. 7 is one of modern make , and may be obtained either of copper or wrought iron , tinned inside . Fig. 8 is another of antiquity , with a large ladle and colander , with holes attached . It is taken from the column of Trajan . The modern ones can be obtained at all prices , according to size , from 13s. 6d. up to L1. 1s. 67 . IN THE MANUFACTURE OF THESE UTENSILS , bronze metal seems to have been much in favour with the ancients . It was chosen not only for their domestic vessels , but it was also much used for their public sculptures and medals . It is a compound , composed of from six to twelve parts of tin to one hundred of copper . It gives its name to figures and all pieces of sculpture made of it . Brass was another favourite metal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more fusible than copper , and not so apt to tarnish . In a pure state it is not malleable , unless when hot , and after it has been melted twice it will not bear the hammer . To render it capable of being wrought , it requires 7 lb. of lead to be put to 1 cwt. of its own material . The Corinthian brass of antiquity was a mixture of silver , gold , and copper . A fine kind of brass , supposed to be made by the cementation of copper plates with calamine , is , in Germany , hammered out into leaves , and is called Dutch metal in this country . It is employed in the same way as gold leaf . Brass is much used for watchworks , as well as for wire . 68 . The braziers , ladles , stewpans , saucepans , gridirons , and colanders of antiquity might generally pass for those of the English manufacture of the present day , in so far as shape is concerned . In proof of this we have placed together the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the reader may , at a single view , see wherein any difference that is between them , consists . Illustration : Fig. 9 . Modern . Illustration : Fig. 10 . Ancient . Illustration : Fig. 11 . Modern . Illustration : Fig. 12 . Ancient . Illustration : Fig. 13 . Modern . Illustration : Fig. 14 .

Figs. 9 and 10 are flat sauce or saute pans , the ancient one being fluted in the handle , and having at the end a ram 's head . Figs. 11 and 12 are colanders , the handle of the ancient one being adorned , in the original , with carved representations of a cornucopia , a satyr , a goat , pigs , and other animals . Any display of taste in the adornment of such utensils , might seem to be useless ; but when we remember how much more natural it is for us all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plain and cheap , it may even become a question in the economy of a kitchen , whether it would not , in the long run , be cheaper to have articles which displayed some tasteful ingenuity in their manufacture , than such as are so perfectly plain as to have no attractions whatever beyond their mere suitableness to the purposes for which they are made . Figs. 13 and 14 are saucepans , the ancient one being of bronze , originally copied from the cabinet of M. l'Abbe Charlet , and engraved in the Antiquities of Montfaucon . Figs. 15 and 17 are gridirons , and 16 and 18 dripping-pans . In all these utensils the resemblance between such as were in use 2,000 years ago , and those in use at the present day , is strikingly manifest . 69 . SOME OF THE ANCIENT UTENSILS represented in the above cuts , are copied from those found amid the ruins of Herculaneum and Pompeii . These Roman cities were , in the first century , buried beneath the lava of an eruption of Vesuvius , and continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last century , when a peasant , in digging for a well , gradually discovered a small temple with some statues . Little notice , however , was taken of this circumstance till 1736 , when the king of Naples , desiring to erect a palace at Portici , caused extensive excavations to be made , when the city of Herculaneum was slowly unfolded to view . Pompeii was discovered about 1750 , and being easier cleared from the lava in which it had so long been entombed , disclosed itself as it existed immediately before the catastrophe which overwhelmed it , nearly two thousand years ago . It presented , to the modern world , the perfect picture of the form and structure of an ancient Roman city . The interior of its habitations , shops , baths , theatres , and temples , were all disclosed , with many of the implements used by the workmen in their various trades , and the materials on which they were employed , when the doomed city was covered with the lavian stream . 70 . AMONGST THE MOST ESSENTIAL REQUIREMENTS of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These are found to have existed among the ancients , and must , at a very early age , have been both publicly and privately employed for the regulation of quantities . The modern English weights were adjusted by the 27th chapter of Magna Charta , or the great charter forced , by the barons , from King John at Runnymede , in Surrey . Therein it is declared that the weights , all over England , shall be the same , although for different commodities there were two different kinds , Troy and Avoirdupois . The origin of both is taken from a grain of wheat gathered in the middle of an ear . The standard of measures was originally kept at Winchester , and by a law of King Edgar was ordained to be observed throughout the kingdom . Illustration : Fig. 19 . Illustration : Fig. 20 . Fig. 19 is an ancient pair of common scales , with two basins and a movable weight , which is made in the form of a head , covered with the pileus , because Mercury had the weights and measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gallery of Florence . Fig. 20 represents a modern weighing-machine , of great convenience , and generally in use in those establishments where a great deal of cooking is carried on . 71 . ACCOMPANYING THE SCALES , or weighing-machines , there should be spice-boxes , and sugar and biscuit-canisters of either white or japanned tin . The covers of these should fit tightly , in order to exclude the air , and if necessary , be lettered in front , to distinguish them . The white metal of which they are usually composed , loses its colour when exposed to the air , but undergoes no further change . It enters largely into the composition of culinary utensils , many of them being entirely composed of tinned sheet-iron ; the inside of copper and iron vessels also , being usually what is called tinned . This art consists of covering any metal with a thin coating of tin ; and it requires the metal to be covered , to be perfectly clean and free from rust , and also that the tin , itself , be purely metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copper boilers , saucepans , and other kitchen utensils , are tinned after they are manufactured , by being first made hot and the tin rubbed on with resin . In this process , nothing ought to be used but pure grain-tin . Lead , however , is sometimes mixed with that metal , not only to make it lie more easily , but to adulterate it  --  a pernicious practice , which in every article connected with the cooking and preparation of food , can not be too severely reprobated.  --  The following list , supplied by Messrs . Richard &; John Slack , 336 , Strand , will show the articles required for the kitchen of a family in the middle class of life , although it does not contain all the things that may be deemed necessary for some families , and may contain more than are required for others . As Messrs . Slack themselves , however , publish a useful illustrated catalogue , which may be had at their establishment gratis , and which it will be found advantageous to consult by those about to furnish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we give :  --  s. d. 1 Tea-kettle 6 6 1 Toasting-fork 1 0 1 Bread-grater 1 0 1 Pair of Brass Candlesticks 3 6 1 Teapot and Tray 6 6 1 Bottle-jack 9 6 6 Spoons 1 6 2 Candlesticks 2 6 1 Candle-box 1 4 6 Knives and Forks 5 3 2 Sets of Skewers 1 0 1 Meat-chopper 1 9 1 Cinder-sifter 1 3 1 Coffee-pot 2 3 1 Colander 1 6 3 Block-tin Saucepans 5 9 5 Iron Saucepans 12 0 1 Ditto and Steamer 6 6 1 Large Boiling-pot 10 0 4 Iron Stewpans 8 9 1 Dripping-pan and Stand 6 6 1 Dustpan 1 0 1 Fish and Egg-slice 1 9 2 Fish-kettles 10 0 1 Flour-box 1 0 3 Flat-irons 3 6 2 Frying-pans 4 0 1 Gridiron 2 0 1 Mustard-pot 1 0 1 Salt-cellar 0 8 1 Pepper-box 0 6 1 Pair of Bellows 2 0 3 Jelly-moulds 8 0 1 Plate-basket 5 6 1 Cheese-toaster 1 10 1 Coal-shovel 2 6 1 Wood Meat-screen 30 0 The Set L8 11 1 72 . AS NOT ONLY HEALTH BUT LIFE may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great attention must be paid to their condition generally , but more especially to that of the saucepans , stewpans , and boilers . Inside they should be kept perfectly clean , and where an open fire is used , the outside as clean as possible . With a Leamington range , saucepans , stewpans , &c.,; can be kept entirely free from smoke and soot on the outside , which is an immense saving of labour to the cook or scullery-maid . Care should be taken that the lids fit tight and close , so that soups or gravies may not be suffered to waste by evaporation . They should be made to keep the steam in and the smoke out , and should always be bright on the upper rim , where they do not immediately come in contact with the fire . Soup-pots and kettles should be washed immediately After being used , and dried before the fire , and they should be kept in a dry place , in order that they may escape the deteriorating influence of rust , and , thereby , be destroyed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinned , and the utmost care should be taken , not to let the tin be rubbed off . If by chance this should occur , have it replaced before the vessel is again brought into use . Neither soup nor gravy should , at any time , be suffered to remain in them longer than is absolutely necessary , as any fat or acid that is in them , may affect the metal , so as to impregnate with poison what is intended to be eaten . Stone and earthenware vessels should be provided for soups and gravies not intended for immediate use , and , also , plenty of common dishes for the larder , that the table-set may not be used for such purposes . It is the nature of vegetables soon to turn sour , when they are apt to corrode glazed red-ware , and even metals , and frequently , thereby , to become impregnated with poisonous particles . The vinegar also in pickles , by its acidity , does the same . Consideration , therefore , should be given to these facts , and great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tapes for collared articles , be well scalded and kept dry , or they will impart an unpleasant flavour when next used . To all these directions the cook should pay great attention , nor should they , by any means , be neglected by the mistress of the household , who ought to remember that cleanliness in the kitchen gives health and happiness to home , whilst economy will immeasurably assist in preserving them . 73 . WITHOUT FUEL , A KITCHEN might be pronounced to be of little use ; therefore , to discover and invent materials for supplying us with the means of domestic heat and comfort , has exercised the ingenuity of man . Those now known have been divided into five classes ; the first comprehending the fluid inflammable bodies ; the second , peat or turf ; the third , charcoal of wood ; the fourth , pit-coal charred ; and the fifth , wood or pit-coal in a crude state , with the capacity of yielding a copious and bright flame . The first may be said seldom to be employed for the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has , in all ages , been regarded as an excellent fuel . It is one of the most important productions of an alluvial soil , and belongs to the vegetable rather than the mineral kingdom . It may be described as composed of wet , spongy black earth , held together by decayed vegetables . Formerly it covered extensive tracts in England , but has greatly disappeared before the genius of agricultural improvement . Charcoal is a kind of artificial coal , used principally where a strong and clear fire is desired . It is a black , brittle , insoluble , inodorous , tasteless substance , and , when newly-made , possesses the remarkable property of absorbing certain quantities of the different gases . Its dust , when used as a polishing powder , gives great brilliancy to metals . It consists of wood half-burned , and is manufactured by cutting pieces of timber into nearly the same size , then disposing them in heaps , and covering them with earth , so as to prevent communication with the air , except when necessary to make them burn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is extinguished by stopping the vents through which the air is admitted . Of coal there are various species ; as , pit , culm , slate , cannel , Kilkenny , sulphurous , bovey , jet , &c.; These have all their specific differences , and are employed for various purposes ; but are all , more or less , used as fuel . The use of coal for burning purposes was not known to the Romans . In Britain it was discovered about fifty years before the birth of Christ , in Lancashire , not tar from where Manchester now stands ; but for ages after its discovery , so long as forests abounded , wood continued to be the fuel used for firing . The first public notice of coal is in the reign of Henry III. , who , in 1272 , granted a charter to the town of Newcastle , permitting the inhabitants to dig for coal . It took some centuries more , however , to bring it into common use , as this did not take place till about the first quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years after the Restoration , we find that about 200,000 chaldrons were consumed in London . Although several countries possess mines of coal , the quality of their mineral is , in general , greatly inferior to that of Great Britain , where it is found mostly in undulating districts abounding with valleys , and interspersed with plains of considerable extent . It lies usually between the strata of other substances , and rarely in an horizontal position , but with a dip or inclination to one side . Our cut , Fig. 21 , represents a section of coal as it is found in the stratum . Illustration : Fig. 21. 74 . TO BE ACQUAINTED WITH THE PERIODS when things are in season , is one of the most essential pieces of knowledge which enter into the " Art of Cookery .

More waste is often occasioned by the want of judgment , or of necessary care in this particular , than by any other cause . In the absence of proper places for keeping provisions , a hanging safe , suspended in an airy situation , is the best substitute . A well-ventilated larder , dry and shady , is better for meat and poultry , which require to be kept for some time ; and the utmost skill in the culinary art will not compensate for the want of proper attention to this particular . Though it is advisable that annual food should be hung up in the open air till its fibres have lost some degree of their toughness , yet , if it is kept till it loses its natural sweetness , its flavour has become deteriorated , and , as a wholesome comestible , it has lost many of its qualities conducive to health . As soon , therefore , as the slightest trace of putrescence is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should be dressed immediately . During the sultry summer months , it is difficult to procure meat that is not either tough or tainted . It should , therefore , be well examined when it comes in , and if flies have touched it , the part must be cut off , and the remainder well washed . In very cold weather , meat and vegetables touched by the frost , should be brought into the kitchen early in the morning , and soaked in cold water . In loins of meat , the long pipe that runs by the bone should be taken out , as it is apt to taint ; as also the kernels of beef . Rumps and edgebones of beef , when bruised , should not be purchased . All these things ought to enter into the consideration of every household manager , and great care should be taken that nothing is thrown away , or suffered to be wasted in the kitchen , which might , by proper management , be turned to a good account . The shank-bones of mutton , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravies , if well soaked and brushed before they are added to the boiling . They are also particularly nourishing for sick persons . Roast-beef bones , or shank-bones of ham , make excellent stock for pea-soup.  --  When the whites of eggs are used for jelly , confectionary , or other purposes , a pudding or a custard should be made , that the yolks may be used . All things likely to be wanted should be in readiness : sugars of different sorts ; currants washed , picked , and perfectly dry ; spices pounded , and kept in very small bottles closely corked , or in canisters , as we have already directed ( 72 ) . Not more of these should be purchased at a time than are likely to be used in the course of a month . Much waste is always prevented by keeping every article in the place best suited to it . Vegetables keep best on a stone floor , if the air be excluded ; meat , in a cold dry place ; as also salt , sugar , sweet-meats , candles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sorts of seed for puddings , should be closely covered to preserve them from insects ; but even this will not prevent them from being affected by these destroyers , if they are long and carelessly kept . Illustration CHAPTER IV . INTRODUCTION TO COOKERY . 76 . AS IN THE FINE ARTS , the progress of mankind from barbarism to civilization is marked by a gradual succession of triumphs over the rude materialities of nature , so in the art of cookery is the progress gradual from the earliest and simplest modes , to those of the most complicated and refined . Plain or rudely-carved stones , tumuli , or mounds of earth , are the monuments by which barbarous tribes denote the events of their history , to be succeeded , only in the long course of a series of ages , by beautifully-proportioned columns , gracefully-sculptured statues , triumphal arches , coins , medals , and the higher efforts of the pencil and the pen , as man advances by culture and observation to the perfection of his facilities . So is it with the art of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon roots and the fruits of the earth , until , by degrees , he is driven to seek for new means , by which his wants may be supplied and enlarged . He then becomes a hunter and a fisher . As his species increases , greater necessities come upon him , when he gradually abandons the roving life of the savage for the more stationary pursuits of the herdsman . These beget still more settled habits , when he begins the practice of agriculture , forms ideas of the rights of property , and has his own , both defined and secured . The forest , the stream , and the sea are now no longer his only resources for food . He sows and he reaps , pastures and breeds cattle , lives on the cultivated produce of his fields , and revels in the luxuries of the dairy ; raises flocks for clothing , and assumes , to all intents and purposes , the habits of permanent life and the comfortable condition of a farmer . This is the fourth stage of social progress , up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , when trade and commerce begin . Through these various phases , only to live has been the great object of mankind ; but , by-and-by , comforts are multiplied , and accumulating riches create new wants . The object , then , is not only to live , but to live economically , agreeably , tastefully , and well . Accordingly , the art of cookery commences ; and although the fruits of the earth , the fowls of the air , the beasts of the field , and the fish of the sea , are still the only food of mankind , yet these are so prepared , improved , and dressed by skill and ingenuity , that they are the means of immeasurably extending the boundaries of human enjoyments . Everything that is edible , and passes under the hands of the cook , is more or less changed , and assumes new forms . Hence the influence of that functionary is immense upon the happiness of a household . 77 . In order that the duties of the Cook may be properly performed , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all terms of indecision should be banished from his art . Accordingly , what is known only to him , will , in these pages , be made known to others . In them all those indecisive terms expressed by a bit of this , some of that , a small piece of that , and a handful of the other , shall never be made use of , but all quantities be precisely and explicitly stated . With a desire , also , that all ignorance on this most essential part of the culinary art should disappear , and that a uniform system of weights and measures should be adopted , we give an account of the weights which answer to certain measures . A TABLE-SPOONFUL is frequently mentioned in a recipe , in the prescriptions of medical men , and also in medical , chemical , and gastronomical works . By it is generally meant and understood a measure or bulk equal to that which would be produced by half an ounce of water . A DESSERT-SPOONFUL is the half of a table-spoonful ; that is to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a quarter of an ounce of water . A TEA-SPOONFUL is equal in quantity to a drachm of water . A DROP .  --  This is the name of a vague kind of measure , , however , will vary , either from the consistency of the liquid or the size and shape of the mouth of the bottle . The College of Physicians determined the quantity of a drop to be one grain , 60 drops making one fluid drachm . Their drop , or sixtieth part of a fluid drachm , is called a minim . Illustration : Fig. 22 . Graduated class measures can be obtained at any chemist 's , and they save much trouble . One of these , containing a wine pint , is divided into 16 oz. , and the oz , into 8 drachms of water ; by which , any certain weight mentioned in a recipe can be accurately measured out . Home-made measures of this kind can readily be formed by weighing the water contained in any given measure , and marking on any tall glass the space it occupies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will be interesting to many readers to know the basis on which the French found their system of weights and measures , for it certainly possesses the grandeur of simplicity . The metre , which is the basis of the whole system of French weights and measures , is the exact measurement of one forty-millionth part of a meridian of the earth . 78 . EXCELLENCE IN THE ART OF COOKERY , as in all other things , is only attainable by practice and experience . In proportion , therefore , to the opportunities which a cook has had of these , so will be his excellence in the art . It is in the large establishments of princes , noblemen , and very affluent families alone , that the man cook is found in this country . He , also , superintends the kitchens of large hotels , clubs , and public institutions , where he , usually , makes out the bills of fare , which are generally submitted to the principal for approval . To be able to do this , therefore , it is absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every dish , as well as know perfectly the state of every article he undertakes to prepare . He must also be a judge of every article he buys ; for no skill , however great it may be , will enable him to , make that good which is really bad . On him rests the responsibility of the cooking generally , whilst a speciality of his department , is to prepare the rich soups , stews , ragouts , and such dishes as enter into the more refined and complicated portions of his art , and such as are not usually understood by ordinary professors . He , therefore , holds a high position in a household , being inferior in rank , as already shown ( 21 ) , only to the house steward , the valet , and the butler . In the luxurious ages of Grecian antiquity , Sicilian cooks were the most esteemed , and received high rewards for their services . Among them , one called Trimalcio was such an adept in his art , that he could impart to common fish both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piscatory tribes . A chief cook in the palmy days of Roman voluptuousness had about L800 a year , and Antony rewarded the one that cooked the supper which pleased Cleopatra , with the present of a city . With the fall of the empire , the culinary art sank into less consideration . In the middle ages , cooks laboured to acquire a reputation for their sauces , which they composed of strange combinations , for the sake of novelty , as well as singularity. 79 . THE DUTIES OF THE COOK , THE KITCHEN AND THE SCULLERY MAIDS , are so intimately associated , that they can hardly be treated of separately . The cook , however , is at the head of the kitchen ; and in proportion to her possession of the qualities of cleanliness , neatness , order , regularity , and celerity of action , so will her influence appear in the conduct of those who are under her ; as it is upon her that the whole responsibility of the business of the kitchen rests , whilst the others must lend her , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tidy in their appearance , and active , in their movements . In the larger establishments of the middle ages , cooks , with the authority of feudal chiefs , gave their orders from a high chair in which they ensconced themselves , and commanded a view of all that was going on throughout their several domains . Each held a long wooden spoon , with which he tasted , without leaving his seat , the various comestibles that were cooking on the stoves , and which he frequently used as a rod of punishment on the backs of those whose idleness and gluttony too largely predominated over their diligence and temperance . 80 . IF , AS WE HAVE SAID ( 3 ) , THE QUALITY OF EARLY RISING be of the first importance to the mistress , what must it be to the servant ! Let it , therefore , be taken as a long-proved truism , that without it , in every domestic , the effect of all things else , so far as work is concerned , may , in a great measure , be neutralized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an hour lost in the morning , will keep her toiling , absolutely toiling , all day , to overtake that which might otherwise have been achieved with ease . In large establishments , six is a good hour to rise in the summer , and seven in the winter . 81 . HER FIRST DUTY , in large establishments and where it is requisite , should be to set her dough for the breakfast rolls , provided this has not been done on the previous night , and then to engage herself with those numerous little preliminary occupations which may not inappropriately be termed laying out her duties for the day . This will bring in the breakfast hour of eight , after which , directions must be given , and preparations made , for the different dinners of the household and family . 82 . IN THOSE NUMEROUS HOUSEHOLDS where a cook and housemaid are only kept , the general custom is , that the cook should have the charge of the dining-room . The hall , the lamps and the doorstep are also committed to her care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside of the house . In establishments of this kind , the cook will , after having lighted her kitchen fire , carefully brushed the range , and cleaned the hearth , proceed to prepare for breakfast . She will thoroughly rinse the kettle , and , filling it with fresh water , will put it on the fire to boil . She will then go to the breakfast-room , or parlour , and there make all things ready for the breakfast of the family . Her attention will next be directed to the hall , which she will sweep and wipe ; the kitchen stairs , if there be any , will now be swept ; and the hall mats , which have been removed and shaken , will be again put in their places . The cleaning of the kitchen , pantry , passages , and kitchen stairs must always be over before breakfast , so that it may not interfere with the other business of the day . Everything should be ready , and the whole house should wear a comfortable aspect when the heads of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it may be depended on , will so please the mistress of an establishment , as to notice that , although she has not been present to see that the work was done , attention to smaller matters has been carefully paid , with a view to giving her satisfaction and increasing her comfort . 83 . BY THE TIME THAT THE COOK has performed the duties mentioned above , and well swept , brushed , and dusted her kitchen , the breakfast-bell will most likely summon her to the parlour , to " bring in " the breakfast . It is the cook 's department , generally , in the smaller establishments , to wait at breakfast , as the housemaid , by this time , has gone up-stairs into the bedrooms , and has there applied herself to her various duties . The cook usually answers the bells and single knocks at the door in the early part of the morning , as the tradesmen , with whom it is her more special business to speak , call at these hours . 84 . IT IS IN HER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight and responsibility of her situation , as she must take upon herself all the dressing and the serving of the principal dishes , which her skill and ingenuity have mostly prepared . Whilst these , however , are cooking , she must be busy with her pastry , soups , gravies , ragouts , &c.; Stock , or what the French call consomme , being the basis of most made dishes , must be always at hand , in conjunction with her sweet herbs and spices for seasoning . " A place for everything , and everything in its place , " must be her rule , in order that time may not be wasted in looking for things when they are wanted , and in order that the whole apparatus of cooking may move with the regularity and precision of a well-adjusted machine ;  --  all must go on simultaneously . The vegetables and sauces must be ready with the dishes they are to accompany , and in order that they may be suitable , the smallest oversight must not be made in their preparation . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cook to dish-up such dishes as may , without injury , stand , for some time , covered on the hot plate or in the hot closet ; but such as are of a more important or recherche kind , must be delayed until the order " to serve " is given from the drawing-room . Then comes haste ; but there must be no hurry ,  --  all must work with order . The cook takes charge of the fish , soups , and poultry ; and the kitchen-maid of the vegetables , sauces , and gravies . These she puts into their appropriate dishes , whilst the scullery-maid waits on and assists the cook . Everything must be timed so as to prevent its getting cold , whilst great care should be taken , that , between the first and second courses , no more time is allowed to elapse than is necessary , for fear that the company in the dining-room lose all relish for what has yet to come of the dinner . When the dinner has been served , the most important feature in the daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must , however , now begin to look to the contents of her larder , taking care to keep everything sweet and clean , so that no disagreeable smells may arise from the gravies , milk , or meat that may be there . These are the principal duties of a cook in a first-rate establishment . In smaller establishments , the housekeeper often conducts the higher department of cooking ( see 58 , 59 , 60 ) , and the cook , with the assistance of a scullery-maid , performs some of the subordinate duties of the kitchen-maid . When circumstances render it necessary , the cook engages to perform the whole of the work of the kitchen , and , in some places , a portion of the house-work also . 85 . WHILST THE COOK IS ENGAGED WITH HER MORNING DUTIES , the kitchen-maid is also occupied with hers . Her first duty , after the fire is lighted , is to sweep and clean the kitchen , and the various offices belonging to it . This she does every morning , besides cleaning the stone steps at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passages , and the stairs which lead to the kitchen . Her general duties , besides these , are to wash and scour all these places twice a week , with the tables , shelves , and cupboards . She has also to dress the nursery and servants ' - hall dinners , to prepare all fish , poultry , and vegetables , trim meat joints and cutlets , and do all such duties as may be considered to enter into the cook 's department in a subordinate degree . 86 . THE DUTIES OF THE SCULLERY-MAID are to assist the cook ; to keep the scullery clean , and all the metallic as well as earthenware kitchen utensils . The position of scullery-maid is not , of course , one of high rank , nor is the payment for her services large . But if she be fortunate enough to have over her a good kitchen-maid and clever cook , she may very soon learn to perform various little duties connected with cooking operations , which may be of considerable service in fitting her for a more responsible place . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our readers , that the fascinations connected with the position of the scullery-maid , are not so great as to induce many people to leave a comfortable home in order to work in a scullery . But we are acquainted with one instance in which the desire , on the part of a young girl , was so strong to become connected with the kitchen and cookery , that she absolutely left her parents , and engaged herself as a scullery-maid in a gentleman 's house . Here she showed herself so active and intelligent , that she very quickly rose to the rank of kitchen-maid ; and from this , so great was her gastronomical genius , she became , in a short space of time , one of the best women-cooks in England . After this , we think , it must be allowed , that a cook , like a poet , nascitur , non fit . 87 . MODERN COOKERY stands so greatly indebted to the gastronomic propensities of our French neighbours , that many of their terms are adopted and applied by English artists to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A vocabulary of these is , therefore , indispensable in a work of this kind . Accordingly , the following will be found sufficiently complete for all ordinary purposes :  --  EXPLANATION OF FRENCH TERMS USED IN MODERN HOUSEHOLD COOKERY . ASPIC .  --  A savoury jelly , used as an exterior moulding for cold game , poultry , fish , &c.; This , being of a transparent nature , allows the bird which it covers to be seen through it . This may also be used for decorating or garnishing . ASSIETTE ( plate ) .  --  Assiettes are the small entrees and hors-d'oeuvres , the quantity of which does not exceed what a plate will hold . At dessert , fruits , cheese , chestnuts , biscuits , &c.,; if served upon a plate , are termed assiettes.  --  ASSIETTE VOLANTE is a dish which a servant hands round to the guests , but is not placed upon the table . Small cheese souffles and different dishes , which ought to be served very hot , are frequently made assielles volantes . AU-BLEU.  --  Fish dressed in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An open saucepan or kettle of nearly boiling water , in which a smaller vessel can be set for cooking and warming . This is very useful for keeping articles hot , without altering their quantity or quality . If you keep sauce , broth , or soup by the fireside , the soup reduces and becomes too strong , and the sauce thickens as well as reduces ; but this is prevented by using the bain-marie , in which the water should be very hot , but not boiling . BECHAMEL.  --  French white sauce , now frequently used in English cookery . BLANCH.  --  To whiten poultry , vegetables , fruit , &c.,; by plunging them into boiling water for a short time , and afterwards plunging them into cold water , there to remain until they are cold . BLANQUETTE.  --  A sort of fricassee . BOUILLI.  --  Beef or other meat boiled ; but , generally speaking , boiled beef is understood by the term . BOUILLIE.  --  A French dish resembling hasty-pudding . BOUILLON .  --  A thin broth or soup . BRAISE.  --  To stew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having previously been blanched . BRAISIERE.  --  A saucepan having a lid with ledges , to put fire on the top . BRIDER.  --  To pass a packthread through poultry , game , &c.,; to keep together their members . CARAMEL ( burnt sugar ) .  --  This is made with a piece of sugar , of the size of a nut , browned in the bottom of a saucepan ; upon which a cupful of stock is gradually poured , stirring all the time a glass of broth , little by little . It may be used with the feather of a quill , to colour meats , such as the upper part of fricandeaux ; and to impart colour to sauces . Caramel made with water instead of stock may be used to colour compotes and other entremets . CASSEROLE .  --  A crust of rice , which , after having been moulded into the form of a pie , is baked , and then filled with a fricassee of white meat or a puree of game . COMPOTE.  --  A stew , as of fruit or pigeons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  --  Ball of fried rice or potatoes . CROUTONS.  --  Sippets of bread . DAUBIERE.  --  An oval stewpan , in which daubes are cooked ; daubes being meat or fowl stewed in sauce . DESOSSER.  --  To bone , or take out the bones from poultry , game , or fish . This is an operation requiring considerable experience . ENTREES.  --  Small side or corner dishes , served with the first course . ENTREMETS.  --  Small side or corner dishes , served with the second course . ESCALOPES.  --  Collops ; small , round , thin pieces of tender meat , or of fish , beaten with the handle of a strong knife to make them tender . FEUILLETAGE.  --  Puff-paste . FLAMBER.  --  To singe fowl or game , after they have been picked . FONCER.  --  To put in the bottom of a saucepan slices of ham , veal , or thin broad slices of bacon . GALETTE.  --  A broad thin cake . GATEAU .  --  A cake , correctly speaking ; but used sometimes to denote a pudding and a kind of tart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or larded fowl , a thick and rich sauce or gravy , called glaze . This is laid on with a feather or brush , and in confectionary the term means to ice fruits and pastry with sugar , which glistens on hardening . HORS-D'OEUVRES.  --  Small dishes , or assiettes volantes of sardines , anchovies , and other relishes of this kind , served to the guests during the first course . ( See ASSIETTES VOLANTES . ) LIT.  --  A bed or layer ; articles in thin slices are placed in layers , other articles , or seasoning , being laid between them .

Illustration SOUPS . CHAPTER V. GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING SOUPS . 88 . LEAN , JUICY BEEF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all good soups ; therefore it is advisable to procure those pieces which afford the richest succulence , and such as are fresh-killed . Stale meat renders them bad , and fat is not so well adapted for making them . The principal art in composing good rich soup , is so to proportion the several ingredients that the flavour of one shall not predominate over another , and that all the articles of which it is composed , shall form an agreeable whole . To accomplish this , care must be taken that the roots and herbs are perfectly well cleaned , and that the water is proportioned to the quantity of meat and other ingredients . Generally a quart of water may be allowed to a pound of meat for soups , and half the quantity for gravies . In making soups or gravies , gentle stewing or simmering is incomparably the best . It may be remarked , however , that a really good soup can never be made but in a well-closed vessel , although , perhaps , greater wholesomeness is obtained by an occasional exposure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from three to six hours doing , and are much better prepared the day before they are wanted . When the soup is cold , the fat may be much more easily and completely removed ; and when it is poured off , care must be taken not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the vessel , which are so fine that they will escape through a sieve . A tamis is the best strainer , and if the soup is strained while it is hot , let the tamis or cloth be previously soaked in cold water . Clear soups must be perfectly transparent , and thickened soups about the consistence of cream . To thicken and give body to soups and gravies , potato-mucilage , arrow-root , bread-raspings , isinglass , flour and butter , barley , rice , or oatmeal , in a little water rubbed well together , are used . A piece of boiled beef pounded to a pulp , with a bit of butter and flour , and rubbed through a sieve , and gradually incorporated with the soup , will be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too thin or too weak , the cover of the boiler should be taken off , and the contents allowed to boil till some of the watery parts have evaporated ; or some of the thickening materials , above mentioned , should be added . When soups and gravies are kept from day to day in hot weather , they should be warmed up every day , and put into fresh scalded pans or tureens , and placed in a cool cellar . In temperate weather , every other day may be sufficient . 89 . VARIOUS HERBS AND VEGETABLES are required for the purpose of making soups and gravies . Of these the principal are ,  --  Scotch barley , pearl barley , wheat flour , oatmeal , bread-raspings , pease , beans , rice , vermicelli , macaroni , isinglass , potato-mucilage , mushroom or mushroom ketchup , champignons , parsnips , carrots , beetroot , turnips , garlic , shalots , and onions . Sliced onions , fried with butter and flour till they are browned , and then rubbed through a sieve , are excellent to heighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and form the basis of many of the fine relishes furnished by the cook . The older and drier the onion , the stronger will be its flavour . Leeks , cucumber , or burnet vinegar ; celery or celery-seed pounded . The latter , though equally strong , does not impart the delicate sweetness of the fresh vegetable ; and when used as a substitute , its flavour should be corrected by the addition of a bit of sugar . Cress-seed , parsley , common thyme , lemon thyme , orange thyme , knotted marjoram , sage , mint , winter savoury , and basil . As fresh green basil is seldom to be procured , and its fine flavour is soon lost , the best way of preserving the extract is by pouring wine on the fresh leaves . 90 . FOR THE SEASONING OF SOUPS , bay-leaves , tomato , tarragon , chervil , burnet , allspice , cinnamon , ginger , nutmeg , clove , mace , black and white pepper , essence of anchovy , lemon-peel , and juice , and Seville orange-juice , are all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemon , and the acid is much milder . These materials , with wine , mushroom ketchup , Harvey 's sauce , tomato sauce , combined in various proportions , are , with other ingredients , manipulated into an almost endless variety of excellent soups and gravies . Soups , which are intended to constitute the principal part of a meal , certainly ought not to be flavoured like sauces , which are only designed to give a relish to some particular dish . SOUP , BROTH AND BOUILLON . 91 . IT HAS BEEN ASSERTED , that English cookery is , nationally speaking , far from being the best in the world . More than this , we have been frequently told by brilliant foreign writers , half philosophers , half chefs , that we are the worst cooks on the face of the earth , and that the proverb which alludes to the divine origin of food , and the precisely opposite origin of its preparers , is peculiarly applicable to us islanders . Not , however , to the inhabitants of the whole island ; for , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , north of the Tweed , that the " broth " of Scotland claims , for excellence and wholesomeness , a very close second place to the bouillon , or common soup of France . " Three hot meals of broth and meat , for about the price of ONE roasting joint , " our Scottish brothers and sisters get , they say ; and we hasten to assent to what we think is now a very well-ascertained fact . We are glad to note , however , that soups of vegetables , fish , meat , and game , are now very frequently found in the homes of the English middle classes , as well as in the mansions of the wealthier and more aristocratic ; and we take this to be one evidence , that we are on the right road to an improvement in our system of cookery . One great cause of many of the spoilt dishes and badly-cooked meats which are brought to our tables , arises , we think , and most will agree with us , from a non-acquaintance with " common , every-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preface the chapters of this work with a simple scientific resume of all those causes and circumstances which relate to the food we have to prepare , and the theory and chemistry of the various culinary operations . Accordingly , this is the proper place to treat of the quality of the flesh of animals , and describe some of the circumstances which influence it for good or bad . We will , therefore , commence with the circumstance of age , and examine how far this affects the quality of meat . 92 . DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN THE BIRTH AND MATURITY OF ANIMALS , their flesh undergoes very considerable changes . For instance , when the animal is young , the fluids which the tissues of the muscles contain , possess a large proportion of what is called albumen . This albumen , which is also the chief component of the white of eggs , possesses the peculiarity of coagulating or hardening at a certain temperature , like the white of a boiled egg , into a soft , white fluid , no longer soluble , or capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this peculiar animal matter gradually decreases , in proportion to the other constituents of the juice of the flesh . Thus , the reason why veal , lamb , and young pork are white , and without gravy when cooked , is , that the large quantity of albumen they contain hardens , or becomes coagulated . On the other hand , the reason why beef and mutton are brown , and have gravy , is , that the proportion of albumen they contain , is small , in comparison with their greater quantity of fluid which is soluble , and not coagulable. 93 . THE QUALITY OF THE FLESH OF AN ANIMAL is considerably influenced by the nature of the food on which it has been fed ; for the food supplies the material which produces the flesh . If the food be not suitable and good , the meat can not be good either ; just as the paper on which these words are printed , could not be good , if the rags from which it is made , were not of a fine quality . To the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh of animals fed on farinaceous produce , such as corn , pulse , &c.,; is firm , well-flavoured , and also economical in the cooking ; that the flesh of those fed on succulent and pulpy substances , such as roots , possesses these qualities in a somewhat less degree ; whilst the flesh of those whose food contains fixed oil , as linseed , is greasy , high coloured , and gross in the fat , and if the food has been used in large quantities , possessed of a rank flavour . 94 . IT IS INDISPENSABLE TO THE GOOD QUALITY OF MEAT , that the animal should be perfectly healthy at the time of its slaughter . However slight the disease in an animal may be , inferiority in the quality of its flesh , as food , is certain to be produced . In most cases , indeed , as the flesh of diseased animals has a tendency to very rapid putrefaction , it becomes not only unwholesome , but absolutely poisonous , on account of the absorption of the virus of the unsound meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The external indications of good and bad meat will be described under its own particular head , but we may here premise that the layer of all wholesome meat , when freshly killed , adheres firmly to the bone . 95 . ANOTHER CIRCUMSTANCE GREATLY AFFECTING THE QUALITY OF MEAT , is the animal 's treatment before it is slaughtered . This influences its value and wholesomeness in no inconsiderable degree . It will be easy to understand this , when we reflect on those leading principles by which the life of an animal is supported and maintained . These are , the digestion of its food , and the assimilation of that food into its substance . Nature , in effecting this process , first reduces the food in the stomach to a state of pulp , under the name of chyme , which passes into the intestines , and is there divided into two principles , each distinct from the other . One , a milk-white fluid ,  --  the nutritive portion ,  --  is absorbed by innumerable vessels which open upon the mucous membrane , or inner coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discharge the fluid into a common duct , or road , along which it is conveyed to the large veins in the neighbourhood of the heart . Here it is mixed with the venous blood ( which is black and impure ) returning from every part of the body , and then it supplies the waste which is occasioned in the circulating stream by the arterial ( or pure ) blood having furnished matter for the substance of the animal . The blood of the animal having completed its course through all parts , and having had its waste recruited by the digested food , is now received into the heart , and by the action of that organ it is urged through the lungs , there to receive its purification from the air which the animal inhales . Again returning to the heart , it is forced through the arteries , and thence distributed , by innumerable ramifications , called capillaries , bestowing to every part of the animal , life and nutriment . The other principle  --  the innutritive portion  --  passes from the intestines , and is thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how flesh is affected for bad , if an animal is slaughtered when the circulation of its blood has been increased by over-driving , ill-usage , or other causes of excitement , to such a degree of rapidity as to be too great for the capillaries to perform their functions , and causing the blood to be congealed in its minuter vessels . Where this has been the case , the meat will be dark-coloured , and become rapidly putrid ; so that self-interest and humanity alike dictate kind and gentle treatment of all animals destined to serve as food for man . THE CHEMISTRY AND ECONOMY OF SOUP-MAKING. 96 . STOCK BEING THE BASIS of all meat soups , and , also , of all the principal sauces , it is essential to the success of these culinary operations , to know the most complete and economical method of extracting , from a certain quantity of meat , the best possible stock or broth . The theory and philosophy of this process we will , therefore , explain , and then proceed to show the practical course to be adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fibres , fat , gelatine , osmazome , and albumen , it is requisite to know that the FIBRES are inseparable , constituting almost all that remains of the meat after it has undergone a long boiling . 98 . FAT is dissolved by boiling ; but as it is contained in cells covered by a very fine membrane , which never dissolves , a portion of it always adheres to the fibres . The other portion rises to the surface of the stock , and is that which has escaped from the cells which were not whole , or which have burst by boiling . 99 . GELATINE is soluble : it is the basis and the nutritious portion of the stock . When there is an abundance of it , it causes the stock , when cold , to become a jelly . 100 . OSMAZOME is soluble even when cold , and is that part of the meat which gives flavour and perfume to the stock . The flesh of old animals contains more osmazome than that of young ones . Brown meats contain more than white , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roasting meat , the osmazome appears to acquire higher properties ; so , by putting the remains of roast meats into your stock-pot , you obtain a better flavour . 101 . ALBUMEN is of the nature of the white of eggs ; it can be dissolved in cold or tepid water , but coagulates when it is put into water not quite at the boiling-point . From this property in albumen , it is evident that if the meat is put into the stock-pot when the water boils , or after this is made to boil up quickly , the albumen , in both cases , hardens . In the first it rises to the surface , in the second it remains in the meat , but in both it prevents the gelatine and osmazome from dissolving ; and hence a thin and tasteless stock will be obtained . It ought to be known , too , that the coagulation of the albumen in the meat , always takes place , more or less , according to the size of the piece , as the parts farthest from the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely dissolving it . 102 . BONES ought always to form a component part of the stock-pot . They are composed of an earthy substance ,  --  to which they owe their solidity ,  --  of gelatine , and a fatty fluid , something like marrow . Two ounces of them contain as much gelatine as one pound of meat ; but in them , this is so incased in the earthy substance , that boiling water can dissolve only the surface of whole bones . By breaking them , however , you can dissolve more , because you multiply their surfaces ; and by reducing them to powder or paste , you can dissolve them entirely ; but you must not grind them dry . We have said ( 99 ) that gelatine forms the basis of stock ; but this , though very nourishing , is entirely without taste ; and to make the stock savoury , it must contain osmazome . Of this , bones do not contain a particle ; and that is the reason why stock made entirely of them , is not liked ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the osmazome contained in it makes the stock sufficiently savoury . 103 . In concluding this part of our subject , the following condensed hints and directions should be attended to in the economy of soup-making :  --  I. BEEF MAKES THE BEST STOCK ; veal stock has less colour and taste ; whilst mutton sometimes gives it a tallowy smell , far from agreeable , unless the meat has been previously roasted or broiled . Fowls add very little to the flavour of stock , unless they be old and fat . Pigeons , when they are old , add the most flavour to it ; and a rabbit or partridge is also a great improvement . From the freshest meat the best stock is obtained . II . IF THE MEAT BE BOILED solely to make stock , it must be cut up into the smallest possible pieces ; but , generally speaking , if it is desired to have good stock and a piece of savoury meat as well , it is necessary to put a rather large piece into the stock-pot , say sufficient for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep well in all weathers . Choose the freshest meat , and have it cut as thick as possible ; for if it is a thin , flat piece , it will not look well , and will be very soon spoiled by the boiling . III . NEVER WASH MEAT , as it deprives its surface of all its juices ; separate it from the bones , and tie it round with tape , so that its shape may be preserved , then put it into the stock-pot , and for each pound of meat , let there be one pint of water ; press it down with the hand , to allow the air , which it contains , to escape , and which often raises it to the top of the water . IV . PUT THE STOCK-POT ON A GENTLE FIRE , so that it may heat gradually . The albumen will first dissolve , afterwards coagulate ; and as it is in this state lighter than the liquid , it will rise to the surface ; bringing with it all its impurities . It is this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ albumen has the same effect in clarifying stock as the white of eggs ; and , as a rule , it may be said that the more scum there is , the clearer will be the stock . Always take care that the fire is very regular . V. REMOVE THE SCUM when it rises thickly , and do not let the stock boil , because then one portion of the scum will be dissolved , and the other go to the bottom of the pot ; thus rendering it very difficult to obtain a clear broth . If the fire is regular , it will not be necessary to add cold water in order to make the scum rise ; but if the fire is too large at first , it will then be necessary to do so . VI . WHEN THE STOCK IS WELL SKIMMED , and begins to boil , put in salt and vegetables , which may be two or three carrots , two turnips , one parsnip , a bunch of leeks and celery tied together . You can add , according to taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an onion , and a tomato . The latter gives a very agreeable flavour to the stock . If fried onion be added , it ought , according to the advice of a famous French chef , to be tied in a little bag : without this precaution , the colour of the stock is liable to be clouded . VII . BY THIS TIME we will now suppose that you have chopped the bones which were separated from the meat , and those which were left from the roast meat of the day before . Remember , as was before pointed out , that the more these are broken , the more gelatine you will have . The best way to break them up is to pound them roughly in an iron mortar , adding , from time to time , a little water , to prevent them getting heated . It is a great saving thus to make use of the bones of meat , which , in too many English families , we fear , are entirely wasted ; for it is certain , as previously stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contain as much gelatine ( which is the nutritive portion of stock ) as one pound of meat . In their broken state tie them up in a bag , and put them in the stock-pot ; adding the gristly parts of cold meat , and trimmings , which can be used for no other purpose . If , to make up the weight , you have received from the butcher a piece of mutton or veal , broil it slightly over a clear fire before putting it in the stock-pot , and be very careful that it does not contract the least taste of being smoked or burnt . VIII . ADD NOW THE VEGETABLES , which , to a certain extent , will stop the boiling of the stock . Wait , therefore , till it simmers well up again , then draw it to the side of the fire , and keep it gently simmering till it is served , preserving , as before said , your fire always the same . Cover the stock-pot well , to prevent evaporation ; do not fill it up , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat is exposed ; in which case a little boiling water may be added , but only enough to cover it . After six hours ' slow and gentle simmering , the stock is done ; and it should not be continued on the fire , longer than is necessary , or it will tend to insipidity . Note .  --  It is on a good stock , or first good broth and sauce , that excellence in cookery depends . If the preparation of this basis of the culinary art is intrusted to negligent or ignorant persons , and the stock is not well skimmed , but indifferent results will be obtained . The stock will never be clear ; and when it is obliged to be clarified , it is deteriorated both in quality and flavour . In the proper management of the stock-pot an immense deal of trouble is saved , inasmuch as one stock , in a small dinner , serves for all purposes . Above all things , the greatest economy , consistent with excellence , should be practised , and the price of everything which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Household Management may appear trifling ; but its practice is extensive , and therefore it requires the best attention . Illustration RECIPES . CHAPTER VI . FRUIT AND VEGETABLE SOUPS . It will be seen , by reference to the following Recipes , that an entirely original and most intelligible system has been pursued in explaining the preparation of each dish . We would recommend the young housekeeper , cook , or whoever may be engaged in the important task of " getting ready " the dinner , or other meal , to follow precisely the order in which the recipes are given . Thus , let them first place on their table all the INGREDIENTS necessary ; then the modus operandi , or MODE of preparation , will be easily managed . By a careful reading , too , of the recipes , there will not be the slightest difficulty in arranging a repast for any number of persons , and an accurate notion will be gained of the TIME the cooling of each dish will occupy , of the periods at which it is SEASONABLE , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural history , and the description of the various properties of the edible articles in common use in every family , will be serviceable both in a practical and an educational point of view . Speaking specially of the Recipes for Soups , it may be added , that by the employment of the BEST , MEDIUM , or COMMON STOCK , the quality of the Soups and their cost may be proportionately increased or lessened . STOCKS FOR ALL KINDS OF SOUPS . RICH STRONG STOCK . 104 . INGREDIENTS .  --  4 lbs . of shin of beef , 4 lbs . of knuckle of veal , 3/4 lb. of good lean ham ; any poultry trimmings ; 3 small onions , 3 small carrots , 3 turnips ( the latter should be omitted in summer , lest they ferment ) , 1 head of celery , a few chopped mushrooms , when obtainable ; 1 tomato , a bunch of savoury herbs , not forgetting parsley ; 1-1/2 oz. of salt , 12 white peppercorns , 6 cloves , 3 small blades of mace , 4 quarts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the ham cut in thin broad slices , carefully trimming off all its rusty fat ; cut up the beef and veal in pieces about 3 inches square , and lay them on the ham ; set it on the stove , and draw it down , and stir frequently . When the meat is equally browned , put in the beef and veal bones , the poultry trimmings , and pour in the cold water . Skim well , and occasionally add a little cold water , to stop its boiling , until it becomes quite clear ; then put in all the other ingredients , and simmer very slowly for 5 hours . Do not let it come to a brisk boil , that the stock be not wasted , and that its colour may be preserved . Strain through a very fine hair sieve , or tammy , and it will be fit for use . Time .  --  5 hours . Average cost , 1s. 3d. per quart . MEDIUM STOCK . 105 . INGREDIENTS .  --  4 lbs . of shin of beef , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lbs . of each ; any bones , trimmings of poultry , or fresh meat , 1/2 a lb. of lean bacon or ham , 2 oz. of butter , 2 large onions , each stuck with 3 cloves ; 1 turnip , 3 carrots , 1/2 a leek , 1 head of celery , 2 oz. of salt , 1/2 a teaspoonful of whole pepper , 1 large blade of mace , 1 small bunch of savoury herbs , 4 quarts and 1/2 pint of cold water . Mode .  --  Cut up the meat and bacon or ham into pieces about 3 inches square ; rub the butter on the bottom of the stewpan ; put in 1/2 a pint of water , the meat , and all the other ingredients . Cover the stewpan , and place it on a sharp fire , occasionally stirring its contents . When the bottom of the pan becomes covered with a pale , jelly-like substance , add 4 quarts of cold water , and simmer very gently for 5 hours . As we have said before , do not let it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is doing , and strain it through a fine hair sieve . This is the basis of many of the soups afterwards mentioned , and will be found quite strong enough for ordinary purposes . Time .  --  5-1/2 hours . Average cost , 9d. per quart . ECONOMICAL STOCK . 106 . INGREDIENTS .  --  The liquor in which a joint of meat has been boiled , say 4 quarts ; trimmings of fresh meat or poultry , shank-bones , &c.,; roast-beef bones , any pieces the larder may furnish ; vegetables , spices , and the same seasoning as in the foregoing recipe . Mode .  --  Let all the ingredients simmer gently for 6 hours , taking care to skim carefully at first . Strain it off , and put by for use . Time .  --  6 hours . Average cost , 3d. per quart . WHITE STOCK . ( To be Used in the Preparation of White Soups. ) 107 . INGREDIENTS .  --  4 lbs . of knuckle of veal , any poultry trimmings , 4 slices of lean ham , 1 carrot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peppercorns , 1 oz. of salt , 1 blade of mace , 1 oz. butter , 4 quarts of water . Mode .  --  Cut up the veal , and put it with the bones and trimmings of poultry , and the ham , into the stewpan , which has been rubbed with the butter . Moisten with 1/2 a pint of water , and simmer till the gravy begins to flow . Then add the 4 quarts of water and the remainder of the ingredients ; simmer for 5 hours . After skimming and straining it carefully through a very fine hair sieve , it will be ready for use . Time .  --  5-1/2 hours . Average cost , 9d. per quart . Note .  --  When stronger stock is desired , double the quantity of veal , or put in an old fowl . The liquor in which a young turkey has been boiled , is an excellent addition to all white stock or soups . BROWNING FOR STOCK . 108 . INGREDIENTS .  --  2 oz. of powdered sugar , and 1/2 a pint of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slow fire until it begins to melt , keeping it stirred with a wooden spoon until it becomes black , then add the water , and let it dissolve . Cork closely , and use a few drops when required . Note .  --  In France , burnt onions are made use of for the purpose of browning . As a general rule , the process of browning is to be discouraged , as apt to impart a slightly unpleasant flavour to the stock , and , consequently , all soups made from it . TO CLARIFY STOCK . 109 . INGREDIENTS .  --  The whites of 2 eggs , 1/2 pint of water , 2 quarts of stock . Mode .  --  Supposing that by some accident the soup is not quite clear , and that its quantity is 2 quarts , take the whites of 2 eggs , carefully separated from their yolks , whisk them well together with the water , and add gradually the 2 quarts of boiling stock , still whisking . Place the soup on the fire , and when boiling and well skimmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then draw it from the fire , and let it settle , until the whites of the eggs become separated . Pass through a fine cloth , and the soup should be clear . Note .  --  The rule is , that all clear soups should be of a light straw colour , and should not savour too strongly of the meat ; and that all white or brown thick soups should have no more consistency than will enable them to adhere slightly to the spoon when hot . All purees should be somewhat thicker . ALMOND SOUP . 110 . INGREDIENTS .  --  4 lbs . of lean beef or veal , 1/2 a scrag of mutton , 1 oz. of vermicelli , 4 blades of mace , 6 cloves , 1/2 lb. of sweet almonds , the yolks of 6 eggs , 1 gill of thick cream , rather more than 2 quarts of water . Mode .  --  Boil the beef , or veal , and the mutton , gently in water that will cover them , till the gravy is very strong , and the meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set it on the fire with the specified quantities of vermicelli , mace , and cloves , to 2 quarts . Let it boil till it has the flavour of the spices . Have ready the almonds , blanched and pounded very fine ; the yolks of the eggs boiled hard ; mixing the almonds , whilst pounding , with a little of the soup , lest the latter should grow oily . Pound them till they are a mere pulp , and keep adding to them , by degrees , a little soup until they are thoroughly mixed together . Let the soup be cool when mixing , and do it perfectly smooth . Strain it through a sieve , set it on the fire , stir frequently , and serve hot . Just before taking it up , add the cream . Time .  --  3 hours . Average cost per quart , 2s. 3d . Seasonable all the year . Sufficient for 8 persons . Illustration : ALMOND &; BLOSSOM . THE ALMOND-TREE.  --  This tree is indigenous to the northern parts of Asia and Africa , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south of France , Italy , and Spain . It flowers in spring , and produces its fruit in August . Although there are two kinds of almonds , the sweet and the bitter , they are considered as only varieties of the same species . The best sweet almonds brought to England , are called the Syrian or Jordan , and come from Malaga ; the inferior qualities are brought from Valentia and Italy . Bitter almonds come principally from Magadore . Anciently , the almond was much esteemed by the nations of the East . Jacob included it among the presents which he designed for Joseph . The Greeks called it the Greek or Thasian nut , and the Romans believed that by eating half a dozen of them , they were secured against drunkenness , however deeply they might imbibe . Almonds , however , are considered as very indigestible . The bitter contain , too , principles which produce two violent poisons ,  --  prussic acid and a kind of volatile oil . It is consequently dangerous to eat them in large quantities . Almonds pounded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a milk similar to that which is yielded by animals . Their oil is used for making fine soap , and their cake as a cosmetic . APPLE SOUP . 111 . INGREDIENTS .  --  2 lbs . of good boiling apples , 3/4 teaspoonful of white pepper , 6 cloves , cayenne or ginger to taste , 3 quarts of medium stock . Mode .  --  Peel and quarter the apples , taking out their cores ; put them into the stock , stew them gently till tender . Rub the whole through a strainer , add the seasoning , give it one boil up , and serve . Time .  --  1 hour . Average cost per quart , 1s . Seasonable from September to December . Sufficient for 10 persons . Illustration : APPLE AND BLOSSOM . THE APPLE .  --  This useful fruit is mentioned in Holy Writ ; and Homer describes it as valuable in his time . It was brought from the East by the Romans , who held it in the highest estimation . Indeed , some of the citizens of the " Eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus the Manlians were called after Manlius , the Claudians after Claudius , and the Appians after Appius . Others were designated after the country whence they were brought ; as the Sidonians , the Epirotes , and the Greeks . The best varieties are natives of Asia , and have , by grafting them upon others , been introduced into Europe . The crab , found in our hedges , is the only variety indigenous to Britain ; therefore , for the introduction of other kinds we are , no doubt , indebted to the Romans . In the time of the Saxon heptarchy , both Devon and Somerset were distinguished as the apple country ; and there are still existing in Herefordshire some trees said to have been planted in the time of William the Conqueror . From that time to this , the varieties of this precious fruit have gone on increasing , and are now said to number upwards of 1,500 . It is peculiar to the temperate zone , being found neither in Lapland , nor within the tropics . The best baking apples for early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rennets and pearmains ; and the best for winter and spring are russets . The best table , or eating apples , are the Margarets for early use ; the Kentish codlin and summer pearmain for summer ; and for autumn , winter , or spring , the Dowton , golden and other pippins , as the ribstone , with small russets . As a food , the apple can not be considered to rank high , as more than the half of it consists of water , and the rest of its properties are not the most nourishing . It is , however , a useful adjunct to other kinds of food , and , when cooked , is esteemed as slightly laxative . ARTICHOKE ( JERUSALEM ) SOUP . ( A White Soup. ) 112 .

It is often vulgarly called , in London , sparrowgrass ; and , in it 's cultivated form , hardly bears any resemblance to the original plant . Immense quantities of it are raised for the London market , at Mortlake and Deptford ; but it belongs rather to the classes of luxurious than necessary food . It is light and easily digested , but is not very nutritious . BAKED SOUP . 115 .

From what country it comes originally , is not known , but it was cultivated in the earliest ages of antiquity , as the Egyptians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the time of Moses . It was a favourite grain with the Athenians , but it was esteemed as an ignominious food by the Romans . Notwithstanding this , however , it was much used by them , as it was in former times by the English , and still is , in the Border counties , in Cornwall , and also in Wales . In other parts of England , it is used mostly for malting purposes . It is less nutritive than wheat ; and in 100 parts , has of starch 79 , gluten 6 , saccharine matter 7 , husk 8 . It is , however , a lighter and less stimulating food than wheat , which renders a decoction of it well adapted for invalids whose digestion is weak . BREAD SOUP . ( Economical. ) 117 .

Illustration : QUERN , or GRINDING-MILL . BREAD .  --  The origin of bread is involved in the obscurity of distant ages . The Greeks attributed its invention to Pan ; but before they , themselves , had an existence , it was , no doubt , in use among the primitive nations of mankind . The Chaldeans and the Egyptians were acquainted with it , and Sarah , the companion of Abraham , mixed flour and water together , kneaded it , and covered it with ashes on the hearth . The Scriptures inform us that leavened bread was known to the Israelites , but it is not known when the art of fermenting it was discovered . It is said that the Romans learnt it during their wars with Perseus , king of Macedon , and that it was introduced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birth of Christ . With them it no doubt found its way into Britain ; but after their departure from the island , it probably ceased to be used . We know that King Alfred allowed the unfermented cakes to burn in the neatherd 's cottage ; and that , even in the sixteenth century , unfermented cakes , kneaded by the women , were the only kind of bread known to the inhabitants of Norway and Sweden . The Italians of this day consume the greater portion of their flour in the form of polenta , or soft pudding , vermicelli , and macaroni ; and , in the remoter districts of Scotland , much unfermented bread is still used . We give a cut of the quern grinding-mill , which , towards the end of the last century , was in use in that country , and which is thus described by Dr. Johnson in his " Journey to the Hebrides : "  --  " It consists of two stones about a foot and half in diameter ; the lower is a little convex , to which the concavity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the upper stone is a round hole , and on one side is a long handle . The grinder sheds the corn gradually into the hole with one hand , and works the handle round with the other . The corn slides down the convexity of the lower stone , and by the motion of the upper , is ground in its passage . " Such a primitive piece of machinery , it may safely be said , has entirely disappeared from this country .  --  In other parts of this work , we shall have opportunities of speaking of bread and bread-making , which , from its great and general use in the nourishment of mankind , has emphatically been called the " staff of life . " The necessity , therefore , of having it both pure and good is of the first importance . CABBAGE SOUP . 118 .

THE CABBAGE .  --  It is remarkable , that although there is no country in the world now more plentifully supplied with fruits and vegetables than Great Britain , yet the greater number of these had no existence in it before the time of Henry VIII . Anderson , writing under the date of 1548 , says , " The English cultivated scarcely any vegetables before the last two centuries . At the commencement of the reign , of Henry VIII . neither salad , nor carrots , nor cabbages , nor radishes , nor any other comestibles of a like nature , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Holland and Flanders . " The original of all the cabbage tribe is the wild plant sea-colewort , which is to be found wasting whatever sweetness it may have on the desert air , on many of the cliffs of the south coast of England . In this state , it scarcely weighs more than half an ounce , yet , in a cultivated state , to what dimensions can it be made to grow ! However greatly the whole of the tribe is esteemed among the moderns , by the ancients they were held in yet higher estimation . The Egyptians adored and raised altars to them , and the Greeks and Romans ascribed many of the most exalted virtues to them . Cato affirmed , that the cabbage cured all diseases , and declared , that it was to its use that the Romans were enabled to live in health and without the assistance of physicians for 600 years . It was introduced by that people into Germany , Gaul , and , no doubt , Britain ; although , in this last , it may have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole tribe is in general wholesome and nutritive , and forms a valuable adjunct to animal food .

The garden carrot in general use , was introduced in the reign of Queen Elizabeth , and was , at first , so highly esteemed , that the ladies wore leaves of it in their head-dresses . It is of great value in the culinary art , especially for soups and stews . It can be used also for beer instead of malt , and , in distillation , it yields a large quantity of spirit . The carrot is proportionably valuable as it has more of the red than the yellow part . There is a large red variety much used by the farmers for colouring butter . As a garden vegetable , it is what is called the orange-carrot that is usually cultivated . As a fattening food for cattle , it is excellent ; but for man it is indigestible , on account of its fibrous matter .

CELERY .  --  This plant is indigenous to Britain , and , in its wild state , grows by the side of ditches and along some parts of the seacoast . In this state it is called smallaqe , and , to some extent , is a dangerous narcotic . By cultivation , however , it has been brought to the fine flavour which the garden plant possesses . In the vicinity of Manchester it is raised to an enormous size . When our natural observation is assisted by the accurate results ascertained by the light of science , how infinitely does it enhance our delight in contemplating the products of nature !

It has an elegant leaf , and is extensively used in the culinary art . When it was introduced to Britain is not known . There are several varieties ,  --  the plain-leaved and the curled-leaved , celery-parsley , Hamburg parsley , and purslane . The curled is the best , and , from the form of its leaf , has a beautiful appearance on a dish as a garnish . Its flavour is , to many , very agreeable in soups ; and although to rabbits , hares , and sheep it is a luxury , to parrots it is a poison . The celery-parsley is used as a celery , and the Hamburg is cultivated only for its roots , which are used as parsnips or carrots , to eat with meat . The purslane is a native of South America , and is not now much in use . CHESTNUT ( SPANISH ) SOUP . 124 .

By the ancients it was much used as a food , and is still common in France and Italy , to which countries it is , by some , considered indigenous . In the southern part of the European continent , it is eaten both raw and roasted . The tree was introduced into Britain by the Romans ; but it only flourishes in the warmer parts of the island , the fruit rarely arriving at maturity in Scotland . It attains a great age , as well as an immense size . As a food , it is the least oily and most farinaceous of all the nuts , and , therefore , the easiest of digestion .

THE COCOA-NUT.  --  This is the fruit of one of the palms , than which it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in itself , so abundantly the goodness of Providence , in making provision for the wants of man . It grows wild in the Indian seas , and in the eastern parts of Asia ; and thence it has been introduced into every part of the tropical regions . To the natives of those climates , its bark supplies the material for creating their dwellings ; its leaves , the means of roofing them ; and the leaf-stalks , a kind of gauze for covering their windows , or protecting the baby in the cradle . It is also made into lanterns , masks to screen the face from the heat of the sun , baskets , wicker-work , and even a kind of paper for writing on . Combs , brooms , torches , ropes , matting , and sailcloth are made of its fibers . With these , too , beds are made and cushions stuffed . Oars are supplied by the leaves ; drinking-cups , spoons , and other domestic utensils by the shells of the nuts ; milk by its juice , of which , also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When fermented , it furnishes the means of intoxication ; and when the fibres are burned , their ashes supply an alkali for making soap . The buds of the tree bear a striking resemblance to cabbage when boiled ; but when they are cropped , the tree dies . In a fresh state , the kernel is eaten raw , and its juice is a most agreeable and refreshing beverage . When the nut is imported to this country , its fruit is , in general , comparatively dry , and is considered indigestible . The tree is one of the least productive of the palm tribe .

THE LEEK .  --  As in the case of the cucumber , this vegetable was bewailed by the Israelites in their journey through the desert . It is one of the alliaceous tribe , which consists of the onion , garlic , chive , shallot , and leek . These , as articles of food , are perhaps more widely diffused over the face of the earth than any other genus of edible plants . It is the national badge of the Welsh , and tradition ascribes to St. David its introduction to that part of Britain . The origin of the wearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , is thus given in " BEETON 'S DICTIONARY of UNIVERSAL INFORMATION : "  --  " It probably originated from the custom of Cymhortha , or the friendly aid , practised among farmers . In some districts of South Wales , all the neighbours of a small farmer were wont to appoint a day when they attended to plough his land , and the like ; and , at such time , it was the custom for each to bring his portion of leeks with him for making the broth or soup . " ( See ST . DAVID . ) Others derive the origin of the custom from the battle of Cressy . The plant , when grown in Wales and Scotland , is sharper than it is in England , and its flavour is preferred by many to that of the onion in broth . It is very wholesome , and , to prevent its tainting the breath , should be well boiled . MACARONI SOUP . 135 .

When it has been well worked , it is put into a hollow cylindrical vessel , pierced with holes of the size of tobacco-pipes at the bottom . Through these holes the mass is forced by a powerful screw bearing on a piece of wood made exactly to fit the inside of the cylinder . Whilst issuing from the holes , it is partially baked by a fire placed below the cylinder , and is , at the same time , drawn away and hung over rods placed about the room , in order to dry . In a few days it is fit for use . As it is both wholesome and nutritious , it ought to be much more used by all classes in England than it is . It generally accompanies Parmesan cheese to the tables of the rich , but is also used for thickening soups and making puddings .

It was , without preparation , eaten by the Hebrews with the Paschal lamb ; the Greeks delighted in it , and the Romans , in the time of Domitian , had it prepared with eggs , and served in the first course at their tables , merely to excite their appetites . Its botanical name is Lactuca , so called from the milky juice it exudes when its stalks are cut . It possesses a narcotic virtue , noticed by ancient physicians ; and even in our day a lettuce supper is deemed conducive to repose . Its proper character , however , is that of a cooling summer vegetable , not very nutritive , but serving as a corrective , or diluent of animal food . MILK SOUP ( a Nice Dish for Children ) . 137 .

Sufficient for 12 persons . Illustration : PEA . THE PEA .  --  It is supposed that the common gray pea , found wild in Greece , and other parts of the Levant , is the original of the common garden pea , and of all the domestic varieties belonging to it . The gray , or field pea , called bisallie by the French , is less subject to run into varieties than the garden kinds , and is considered by some , perhaps on that account , to be the wild plant , retaining still a large proportion of its original habit . From the tendency of all other varieties " to run away " and become different to what they originally were , it is very difficult to determine the races to which they belong . The pea was well known to the Romans , and , probably , was introduced to Britain at an early period ; for we find peas mentioned by Lydgate , a poet of the 15th century , as being hawked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , to have fallen out of use ; for , in the reign of Queen Elizabeth , Fuller tells us they were brought from Holland , and were accounted " fit dainties for ladies , they came so far and cost so dear . " There are some varieties of peas which have no lining in their pods , which are eaten cooked in the same way as kidney-beans . They are called sugar peas , and the best variety is the large crooked sugar , which is also very good , used in the common way , as a culinary vegetable . There is also a white sort , which readily splits when subjected to the action of millstones set wide apart , so as not to grind them . These are used largely for soups , and especially for sea-stores . From the quantity of farinaceous and saccharine matter contained in the pea , it is highly nutritious as an article of food .

Its value , however , amply repays him for whatever care and kindness he may bestow upon it ; for , like the ox , there is scarcely a part of it that he can not convert to some useful purpose .

Its entrails are used as strings for musical instruments , and its bones are calcined , and employed as tests in the trade of the refiner . Its milk , being thicker than that of the cow , yields a greater quantity of butter and cheese , and its flesh is among the most wholesome and nutritive that can be eaten . Thomson has beautifully described the appearance of the sheep , when bound to undergo the operation of being shorn of its wool .

THE OX .  --  Of the quadrupedal animals , the flesh of those that feed upon herbs is the most wholesome and nutritious for human food .

There are no animals of greater use to man than the tribe to which the ox belongs . There is hardly a part of them that does not enter into some of the arts and purposes of civilized life .

Glue is made from their gristles , cartilages , and portions of their hides . Their bones often form a substitute for ivory ; their skins , when calves , are manufactured into vellum ; their blood is the basis of Prussian blue ; their sinews furnish fine and strong threads , used by saddlers ; their hair enters into various manufactures ; their tallow is made into candles ; their flesh is eaten , and the utility of the milk and cream of the cow is well known .

The Athenians trained this bird for fighting , and Severus used to lighten the cares of royalty by witnessing the spirit of its combats . The Greeks esteemed its leg most highly , and rejected the other portions as unfashionable to be eaten . The Romans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast , whilst we consider the bird as wholly palatable .

THE TURKEY .  --  The common turkey is a native of North America , and was thence introduced to England , in the reign of Henry VIII . According to Tusser 's " Five Hundred Points of Good Husbandry , " about the year 1585 it begun to form a dish at our rural Christmas feasts . " Beef , mutton , and pork , shred pies of the best , Pig , veal , goose , and capon , and turkey well dress 'd , Cheese , apples , and nuts , jolly carols to hear , As then in the country is counted good cheer . " It is one of the most difficult birds to rear , of any that we have ; yet , in its wild state , is found in great abundance in the forests of Canada , where , it might have been imagined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever becoming plentiful . They are very fond of the seeds of nettles , and the seeds of the foxglove poison them . TURTLE SOUP ( founded on M. Ude 's Recipe ) . 189 . INGREDIENTS .  --  A turtle , 6 slices of ham , 2 knuckles of veal , 1 large bunch of sweet herbs , 3 bay-leaves , parsley , green onions , 1 onion , 6 cloves , 4 blades of mace , 1/4 lb. of fresh butter , 1 bottle of Madeira , 1 lump of sugar . For the Quenelles a Tortue , 1 lb. of veal , 1 lb. of bread crumbs , milk , 7 eggs , cayenne , salt , spices , chopped parsley , the juice of 2 lemons . Mode .  --  To make this soup with less difficulty , cut off the head of the turtle the preceding day . In the morning open the turtle by leaning heavily with a knife on the shell of the animal 's back , whilst you cut this off all round . Turn it upright on its end , that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flesh should be cut off along the spine , with the knife sloping towards the bones , for fear of touching the gall , which sometimes might escape the eye . When all the flesh about the members is obtained , wash these clean , and let them drain . Have ready , on the fire , a large vessel full of boiling water , into which put the shells ; and when you perceive that they come easily off , take them out of the water , and prick them all , with those of the back , belly , fins , head , &c.; Boil the back and belly till the bones can be taken off , without , however , allowing the softer parts to be sufficiently done , as they will be boiled again in the soup . When these latter come off easily , lay them on earthen dishes singly , for fear they should stick together , and put them to cool . Keep the liquor in which you have blanched the softer parts , and let the bones stew thoroughly in it , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the flesh of the interior parts , the four legs and head , must be drawn down in the following manner :  --  Lay the slices of ham on the bottom of a very large stewpan , over them the knuckles of veal , according to the size of the turtle ; then the inside flesh of the turtle , and over the whole the members . Now moisten with the water in which you are boiling the shell , and draw it down thoroughly . It may now be ascertained if it be thoroughly done by thrusting a knife into the fleshy part of the meat . If no blood appears , it is time to moisten it again with the liquor in which the bones , &c.; have been boiling . Put in a large bunch of all such sweet herbs as are used in the cooking of a turtle ,  --  sweet basil , sweet marjoram , lemon thyme , winter savory , 2 or 3 bay-leaves , common thyme , a handful of parsley and green onions , and a large onion stuck with 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect to the members , probe them , to see whether they are done , and if so , drain and send them to the larder , as they are to make their appearance only when the soup is absolutely completed . When the flesh is also completely done , strain it through a silk sieve , and make a very thin white roux ; for turtle soup must not be much thickened . When the flour is sufficiently done on a slow fire , and has a good colour , moisten it with the liquor , keeping it over the fire till it boils . Ascertain that the sauce is neither too thick nor too thin ; then draw the stewpan on the side of the stove , to skim off the white scum , and all the fat and oil that rise to the surface of the sauce . By this time all the softer parts will be sufficiently cold ; when they must be cut to about the size of one or two inches square , and thrown into the soup , which must now be left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat and froth . Take all the leaves of the herbs from the stock ,  --  sweet basil , sweet marjoram , lemon thyme , winter savory , 2 or 3 bay-leaves , common thyme , a handful of parsley and green onions , and a large onion cut in four pieces , with a few blades of mace . Put these in a stewpan , with about 1/4 lb. of fresh butter , and let it simmer on a slow fire till quite melted , when pour in 1 bottle of good Madeira , adding a small bit of sugar , and let it boil gently for 1 hour . When done , rub it through a tammy , and add it to the soup . Let this boil , till no white scum rises ; then take with a skimmer all the bits of turtle out of the sauce , and put them in a clean stewpan : when you have all out , pour the soup over the bits of turtle , through a tammy , and proceed as follows :  --  QUENELLES A TORTUE.  --  Make some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not require to be very delicate . Take out the fleshy part of a leg of veal , about 1 lb. , scrape off all the meat , without leaving any sinews or fat , and soak in milk about the same quantity of crumbs of bread . When the bread is well soaked , squeeze it , and put it into a mortar , with the veal , a small quantity of calf 's udder , a little butter , the yolks of 4 eggs , boiled hard , a little cayenne pepper , salt , and spices , and pound the whole very fine ; then thicken the mixture with 2 whole eggs , and the yolk of another . Next try this farce or stuffing in boiling-hot water , to ascertain its consistency : if it is too thin , add the yolk of an egg . When the farce is perfected , take half of it , and put into it some chopped parsley . Let the whole cool , in order to roll it of the size of the yolk of an egg ; poach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , drain on a sieve , and put it into the turtle . Before you send up , squeeze the juice of 2 or 3 lemons , with a little cayenne pepper , and pour that into the soup . THE FINS may be served as a plat d'entree with a little turtle sauce ; if not , on the following day you may warm the turtle au bain marie , and serve the members entire , with a matelote sauce , garnished with mushrooms , cocks ' combs , quenelles , &c.; When either lemon-juice or cayenne pepper has been introduced , no boiling must take place . Note .  --  It is necessary to observe , that the turtle prepared a day before it is used , is generally preferable , the flavour being more uniform . Be particular , when you dress a very large turtle , to preserve the green fat ( be cautious not to study a very brown colour ,  --  the natural green of the fish is preferred by every epicure and true connoisseur ) in a separate stewpan , and likewise when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tureens as you mean to serve each time . You can not put the whole in a large vessel , for many reasons : first , it will be long in cooling ; secondly , when you take some out , it will break all the rest into rags . If you warm in a bain marie , the turtle will always retain the same taste ; but if you boil it often , it becomes strong , and loses the delicacy of its flavour . THE COST OF TURTLE SOUP .  --  This is the most expensive soup brought to table . It is sold by the quart ,  --  one guinea being the standard price for that quantity . The price of live turtle ranges from 8d. to 2s. per lb. , according to supply and demand . When live turtle is dear , many cooks use the tinned turtle , which is killed when caught , and preserved by being put in hermetically-sealed canisters , and so sent over to England . The cost of a tin , containing 2 quarts , or 4 lbs. , is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green fat , 7s. 6d . From these about 6 quarts of good soup may be made . Illustration : THE TURTLE . THE GREEN TURTLE .  --  This reptile is found in large numbers on the coasts of all the islands and continents within the tropics , in both the old and new worlds . Their length is often five feet and upwards , and they range in weight from 50 to 500 or 600 lbs . As turtles find a constant supply of food on the coasts which they frequent , they are not of a quarrelsome disposition , as the submarine meadows in which they pasture , yield plenty for them all . Like other species of amphibia , too , they have the power of living many months without food ; so that they live harmlessly and peaceably together , notwithstanding that they seem to have no common bond of association , but merely assemble in the same places as if entirely by accident . England is mostly supplied with them from the West Indies , whence they are brought alive and in tolerable health . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of its flesh , the fat of the upper and lower shields of the animal being esteemed the richest and most delicate parts . The soup , however , is apt to disagree with weak stomachs . As an article of luxury , the turtle has only come into fashion within the last 100 years , and some hundreds of tureens of turtle soup are served annually at the lord mayor 's dinner in Guildhall .

TABLE BEER .  --  This is nothing more than a weak ale , and is not made so much with a view to strength , as to transparency of colour and an agreeable bitterness of taste . It is , or ought to be , manufactured by the London professional brewers , from the best pale malt , or amber and malt . Six barrels are usually drawn from one quarter of malt , with which are mixed 4 or 5 lbs . of hops . As a beverage , it is agreeable when fresh ; but it is not adapted to keep long . FISH SOUPS .

The Greeks preferred it when brought from Alexandria , and the Romans ate it boiled with cumin , and seasoned with pepper and other condiments . A recipe tells us , that crayfish can be preserved several days in baskets with fresh grass , such as the nettle , or in a bucket with about three-eighths of an inch of water . More water would kill them , because the large quantity of air they require necessitates the water in which they are kept , to be continually renewed . EEL SOUP . 194 .

SEASON OF OYSTERS.  --  From April and May to the end of July , oysters are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they become healthy , having recovered from the effects of spawning . When they are not in season , the males have a black , and the females a milky substance in the gill . From some lines of Oppian , it would appear that the ancients were ignorant that the oyster is generally found adhering to rocks . The starfish is one of the most deadly enemies of these bivalves . The poet says :  --  The prickly star creeps on with full deceit To force the oyster from his close retreat . When gaping lids their widen 'd void display , The watchful star thrusts in a pointed ray , Of all its treasures spoils the rifled case , And empty shells the sandy hillock grace . PRAWN SOUP . 198 .

THE PRAWN .  --  This little fish bears a striking resemblance to the shrimp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to be found on most of the sandy shores of Europe . The Isle of Wight is famous for shrimps , where they are potted ; but both the prawns and the shrimps vended in London , are too much salted for the excellence of their natural flavour to be preserved . They are extremely lively little animals , as seen in their native retreats . Illustration FISH . CHAPTER VII . THE NATURAL HISTORY OF FISHES . 199 . IN NATURAL HISTORY , FISHES form the fourth class in the system of Linnaeus , and are described as having long under-jaws , eggs without white , organs of sense , fins for supporters , bodies covered with concave scales , gills to supply the place of lungs for respiration , and water for the natural element of their existence . Had mankind no other knowledge of animals than of such as inhabit the land and breathe their own atmosphere , they would listen with incredulous wonder , if told that there were other kinds of beings which existed only in the waters , and which would die almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly these facts might be attested , they would hardly believe them , without the operation of their own senses , as they would recollect the effect produced on their own bodies when immersed in water , and the impossibility of their sustaining life in it for any lengthened period of time . Experience , however , has taught them , that the " great deep " is crowded with inhabitants of various sizes , and of vastly different constructions , with modes of life entirely distinct from those which belong to the animals of the land , and with peculiarities of design , equally wonderful with those of any other works which have come from the hand of the Creator . The history of these races , however , must remain for ever , more or less , in a state of darkness , since the depths in which they live , are beyond the power of human exploration , and since the illimitable expansion of their domain places them almost entirely out of the reach of human accessibility . 200 . IN STUDYING THE CONFORMATION OF FISHES , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well adapted to the element in which they have their existence . Their shape has a striking resemblance to the lower part of a ship ; and there is no doubt that the form of the fish originally suggested the form of the ship . The body is in general slender , gradually diminishing towards each of its extremities , and flattened on each of its sides . This is precisely the form of the lower part of the hull of a ship ; and it enables both the animal and the vessel , with comparative ease , to penetrate and divide the resisting medium for which they have been adapted . The velocity of a ship , however , in sailing before the wind , is by no means to be compared to that of a fish . It is well known that the largest fishes will , with the greatest ease , overtake a ship in full sail , play round it without effort , and shoot ahead of it at pleasure . This arises from their great flexibility , which , to compete with mocks the labours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a season , without the slightest indications of languor or fatigue . 201 . THE PRINCIPAL INSTRUMENTS EMPLOYED BY FISHES to accelerate their motion , are their air-bladder , fins , and tail . By means of the air-bladder they enlarge or diminish the specific gravity of their bodies . When they wish to sink , they compress the muscles of the abdomen , and eject the air contained in it ; by which , their weight , compared with that of the water , is increased , and they consequently descend . On the other hand , when they wish to rise , they relax the compression of the abdominal muscles , when the air-bladder fills and distends , and the body immediately ascends to the surface . How simply , yet how wonderfully , has the Supreme Being adapted certain means to the attainment of certain ends ! Those fishes which are destitute of the air-bladder are heavy in the water , and have no great " alacrity " in rising . The larger proportion of them remain at the bottom , unless they are so formed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient force to enable them to ascend . When the air-bladder of a fish is burst , its power of ascending to the surface has for ever passed away . From a knowledge of this fact , the fishermen of cod are enabled to preserve them alive for a considerable time in their well-boats . The means they adopt to accomplish this , is to perforate the sound , or air-bladder , with a needle , which disengages the air , when the fishes immediately descend to the bottom of the well , into which they are thrown . Without this operation , it would be impossible to keep the cod under water whilst they had life . In swimming , the fins enable fishes to preserve their upright position , especially those of the belly , which act like two feet . Without those , they would swim with their bellies upward , as it is in their backs that the centre of gravity lies . In ascending and descending , these are likewise of great assistance , as they contract and expand accordingly . The tail is an instrument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all its motions . In some instances it acts like the rudder of a ship , and enables it to turn sideways ; and when moved from side to side with a quick vibratory motion , fishes are made , in the same manner as the " screw " propeller makes a steamship , to dart forward with a celerity proportioned to the muscular force with which it is employed . 202 . THE BODIES OF FISHES are mostly covered with a kind of horny scales ; but some are almost entirely without them , or have them so minute as to be almost invisible ; as is the case with the eel . The object of these is to preserve them from injury by the pressure of the water , or the sudden contact with pebbles , rocks , or sea-weeds . Others , again , are enveloped in a fatty , oleaginous substance , also intended as a defence against the friction of the water ; and those in which the scales are small , are supplied with a larger quantity of slimy matter . 203 . THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organs which are placed on each side of the neck , and which are called gills . It is curious to watch the process of breathing as it is performed by the finny tribes . It seems to be so continuous , that it might almost pass for an illustration of the vexed problem which conceals the secret of perpetual motion . In performing it , they fill their mouths with water , which they drive backwards with a force so great as to open the large flap , to allow it to escape behind . In this operation all , or a great portion , of the air contained in the water , is left among the feather-like processes of the gills , and is carried into the body , there to perform its part in the animal economy . In proof of this , it has been ascertained that , if the water in which fishes are put , is , by any means , denuded of its air , they immediately seek the surface , and begin to gasp for it . Hence , distilled water is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to most other animals . For this reason , when a fishpond , or other aqueous receptacle in which fishes are kept , is entirely frozen over , it is necessary to make holes in the ice , not so especially for the purpose of feeding them , as for that of giving them air to breathe . 204 . THE POSITIONS OF THE TEETH OF FISHES are well calculated to excite our amazement ; for , in some cases , these are situated in the jaws , sometimes on the tongue or palate , and sometimes even in the throat . They are in general sharp-pointed and immovable ; but in the carp they are obtuse , and in the pike so easily moved as to seem to have no deeper hold than such as the mere skin can afford . In the herring , the tongue is set with teeth , to enable it the better , it is supposed , to retain its food . 205 . ALTHOUGH NATURALISTS HAVE DIVIDED FISHES into two great tribes , the osseous and the cartilaginous , yet the distinction is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cartilage , and the second , at any rate , a portion of calcareous matter in their bones . It may , therefore , be said that the bones of fishes form a kind of intermediate substance between true bones and cartilages . The backbone extends through the whole length of the body , and consists of vertebrae , strong and thick towards the head , but weaker and more slender as it approaches the tail . Each species has a determinate number of vertebrae , which are increased in size in proportion with the body . The ribs are attached to the processes of the vertebrae , and inclose the breast and abdomen . Some kinds , as the rays , have no ribs ; whilst others , as the sturgeon and eel , have very short ones . Between the pointed processes of the vertebrae are situated the bones which support the dorsal ( back ) and the anal ( below the tail ) fins , which are connected with the processes by a ligament . At the breast are the sternum or breastbone , clavicles or collar-bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pectoral or breast fins are placed . The bones which support the ventral or belly fins are called the ossa pelvis . Besides these principal bones , there are often other smaller ones , placed between the muscles to assist their motion . 206 . SOME OF THE ORGANS OF SENSE IN FISHES are supposed to be possessed by them in a high degree , and others much more imperfectly . Of the latter kind are the senses of touch and taste , which are believed to be very slightly developed . On the other hand , those of hearing , seeing , and smelling , are ascertained to be acute , but the first in a lesser degree than both the second and third . Their possession of an auditory organ was long doubted , and even denied by some physiologists ; but it has been found placed on the sides of the skull , or in the cavity which contains the brain . It occupies a position entirely distinct and detached from the skull , and , in this respect , differs in the local disposition of the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in those of the ray kind , the organ is wholly encompassed by those parts which contain the cavity of the skull ; whilst in the cod and salmon kind it is in the part within the skull . Its structure is , in every way , much more simple than that of the same sense in those animals which live entirely in the air ; but there is no doubt that they have the adaptation suitable to their condition . In some genera , as in the rays , the external orifice or ear is very small , and is placed in the upper surface of the head ; whilst in others there is no visible external orifice whatever . However perfect the sight of fishes may be , experience has shown that this sense is of much less use to them than that of smelling , in searching for their food . The optic nerves in fishes have this peculiarity ,  --  that they are not confounded with one another in their middle progress between their origin and their orbit . The one passes over the other without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the left side of the brain goes distinctly to the right eye , and that which comes from the right goes distinctly to the left . In the greater part of them , the eye is covered with the same transparent skin that covers the rest of the head . The object of this arrangement , perhaps , is to defend it from the action of the water , as there are no eyelids . The globe in front is somewhat depressed , and is furnished behind with a muscle , which serves to lengthen or flatten it , according to the necessities of the animal . The crystalline humour , which in quadrupeds is flattened , is , in fishes , nearly globular . The organ of smelling in fishes is large , and is endued , at its entry , with a dilating and contracting power , which is employed as the wants of the animal may require . It is mostly by the acuteness of their smell that fishes are enabled to discover their food ; for their tongue is not designed for nice sensation , being of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . WITH RESPECT TO THE FOOD OF FISHES , this is almost universally found in their own element . They are mostly carnivorous , though they seize upon almost anything that comes in their way : they even devour their own offspring , and manifest a particular predilection for all living creatures . Those , to which Nature has meted out mouths of the greatest capacity , would seem to pursue everything with life , and frequently engage in fierce conflicts with their prey . The animal with the largest mouth is usually the victor ; and he has no sooner conquered his foe than he devours him . Innumerable shoals of one species pursue those of another , with a ferocity which draws them from the pole to the equator , through all the varying temperatures and depths of their boundless domain . In these pursuits a scene of universal violence is the result ; and many species must have become extinct , had not Nature accurately proportioned the means of escape , the production , and the numbers , to the extent and variety of the danger to which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only more numerous , but more productive than the larger ; whilst their instinct leads them in search of food and safety near the shores , where , from the shallowness of the waters , many of their foes are unable to follow them . 208 . THE FECUNDITY OF FISHES has been the wonder of every natural philosopher whose attention has been attracted to the subject . They are in general oviparous , or egg-producing ; but there are a few , such as the eel and the blenny , which are viviparous , or produce their young alive . The males have the milt and the females the roe ; but some individuals , as the sturgeon and the cod tribes , are said to contain both . The greater number deposit their spawn in the sand or gravel ; but some of those which dwell in the depths of the ocean attach their eggs to sea-weeds . In every instance , however , their fruitfulness far surpasses that of any other race of animals . According to Lewenhoeck , the cod annually spawns upwards of nine millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces one million ; the mackerel above five hundred thousand ; a herring of a moderate size at least ten thousand ; a carp fourteen inches in length , according to Petit , contained two hundred and sixty-two thousand two hundred and twenty-four ; a perch deposited three hundred and eighty thousand six hundred and forty ; and a female sturgeon seven millions six hundred and fifty-three thousand two hundred . The viviparous species are by no means so prolific ; yet the blenny brings forth two or three hundred at a time , which commence sporting together round their parent the moment they have come into existence . 209 . IN REFERENCE TO THE LONGEVITY OF FISHES , it is affirmed to surpass that of all other created beings ; and it is supposed they are , to a great extent , exempted from the diseases to which the flesh of other animals is heir . In place of suffering from the rigidity of age , which is the cause of the natural decay of those that " live and move and have their being " on the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food , and the conduits of life to perform their functions unimpaired . The age of fishes has not been properly ascertained , although it is believed that the most minute of the species has a longer lease of life than man . The mode in which they die has been noted by the Rev. Mr. White , the eminent naturalist of Selbourne . As soon as the fish sickens , the head sinks lower and lower , till the animal , as it were , stands upon it . After this , as it becomes weaker , it loses its poise , till the tail turns over , when it comes to the surface , and floats with its belly upwards . The reason for its floating in this manner is on account of the body being no longer balanced by the fins of the belly , and the broad muscular back preponderating , by its own gravity , over the belly , from this latter being a cavity , and consequently lighter . 210 . FISHES ARE EITHER SOLITARY OR GREGARIOUS , and some of them migrate to great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spawn . Of sea-fishes , the cod , herring , mackerel , and many others , assemble in immense shoals , and migrate through different tracts of the ocean ; but , whether considered in their solitary or gregarious capacity , they are alike wonderful to all who look through Nature up to Nature 's God , and consider , with due humility , yet exalted admiration , the sublime variety , beauty , power , and grandeur of His productions , as manifested in the Creation . FISH AS AN ARTICLE OF HUMAN FOOD . 211 . AS THE NUTRITIVE PROPERTIES OF FISH are deemed inferior to those of what is called butchers ' meat , it would appear , from all we can learn , that , in all ages , it has held only a secondary place in the estimation of those who have considered the science of gastronomy as a large element in the happiness of mankind . Among the Jews of old it was very little used , although it seems not to have been entirely interdicted , as Moses prohibited only the use of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , made fish an article of diet , notwithstanding that it was rejected by their priests . Egypt , however , is not a country favourable to the production of fish , although we read of the people , when hungry , eating it raw ; of epicures among them having dried it in the sun ; and of its being salted and preserved , to serve as a repast on days of great solemnity . The modern Egyptians are , in general , extremely temperate in regard to food . Even the richest among them take little pride , and , perhaps , experience as little delight , in the luxuries of the table . Their dishes mostly consist of pilaus , soups , and stews , prepared principally of onions , cucumbers , and other cold vegetables , mixed with a little meat cut into small pieces . On special occasions , however , a whole sheep is placed on the festive board ; but during several of the hottest months of the year , the richest restrict themselves entirely to a vegetable diet . The poor are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they may dip their bread . 212 . PASSING FROM AFRICA TO EUROPE , we come amongst a people who have , almost from time immemorial , occupied a high place in the estimation of every civilized country ; yet the Greeks , in their earlier ages , made very little use of fish as an article of diet . In the eyes of the heroes of Homer it had little favour ; for Menelaus complained that " hunger pressed their digestive organs , " and they had been obliged to live upon fish . Subsequently , however , fish became one of the principal articles of diet amongst the Hellenes ; and both Aristophanes and Athenaeus allude to it , and even satirize their countrymen for their excessive partiality to the turbot and mullet . So infatuated were many of the Greek gastronomes with the love of fish , that some of them would have preferred death from indigestion to the relinquishment of the precious dainties with which a few of the species supplied them . Philoxenes of Cythera was one of these . On being informed by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of the quantity he was consuming of a delicious fish , " Be it so , " he calmly observed ; " but before I die , let me finish the remainder . " 213 . THE GEOGRAPHICAL SITUATION OF GREECE was highly favourable for the development of a taste for the piscatory tribes ; and the skill of the Greek cooks was so great , that they could impart every variety of relish to the dish they were called upon to prepare . Athenaeus has transmitted to posterity some very important precepts upon their ingenuity in seasoning with salt , oil , and aromatics . At the present day the food of the Greeks , through the combined influence of poverty and the long fasts which their religion imposes upon them , is , to a large extent , composed of fish , accompanied with vegetables and fruit . Caviare , prepared from the roes of sturgeons , is the national ragout , which , like all other fish dishes , they season with aromatic herbs . Snails dressed in garlic are also a favourite dish . 214 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took their taste in the fine arts from the Greeks , so did they , in some measure , their piscine appetites . The eel-pout and the lotas 's liver were the favourite fish dishes of the Roman epicures ; whilst the red mullet was esteemed as one of the most delicate fishes that could be brought to the table . With all the elegance , taste , and refinement of Roman luxury , it was sometimes promoted or accompanied by acts of great barbarity . In proof of this , the mention of the red mullet suggests the mode in which it was sometimes treated for the , to us , horrible entertainment of the fashionable in Roman circles . It may be premised , that as England has , Rome , in her palmy days , had , her fops , who had , no doubt , through the medium of their cooks , discovered that when the scales of the red mullet were removed , the flesh presented a fine pink-colour . Having discovered this , it was further observed that at the death of the animal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , in order that these might be witnessed and enjoyed in their fullest perfection , the poor mullet was served alive in a glass vessel . 215 . THE LOVE OF FISH among the ancient Romans rose to a real mania . Apicius offered a prize to any one who could invent a new brine compounded of the liver of red mullets ; and Lucullus had a canal cut through a mountain , in the neighbourhood of Naples , that fish might be the more easily transported to the gardens of his villa . Hortensius , the orator , wept over the death of a turbot which he had fed with his own hands ; and the daughter of Druses adorned one that she had , with rings of gold . These were , surely , instances of misplaced affection ; but there is no accounting for tastes . It was but the other day that we read in the " Times " of a wealthy living English hermit , who delights in the companionship of rats ! The modern Romans are merged in the general name of Italians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specially characteristic article of food . 216 . FROM ROME TO GAUL is , considering the means of modern locomotion , no great way ; but the ancient sumptuary laws of that kingdom give us little information regarding the ichthyophagous propensities of its inhabitants . Louis XII . engaged six fishmongers to furnish his board with fresh-water animals , and Francis I. had twenty-two , whilst Henry the Great extended his requirements a little further , and had twenty-four . In the time of Louis XIV . the cooks had attained to such a degree of perfection in their art , that they could convert the form and flesh of the trout , pike , or carp , into the very shape and flavour of the most delicious game . The French long enjoyed a European reputation for their skill and refinement in the preparing of food . In place of plain joints , French cookery delights in the marvels of what are called made dishes , ragouts , stews , and fricassees , in which no trace of the original materials of which they are compounded is to be found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it has been asserted , by , at least , one authority , that the ancient inhabitants ate no fish . However this may be , we know that the British shores , particularly those of the North Sea , have always been well supplied with the best kinds of fish , which we may reasonably infer was not unknown to the inhabitants , or likely to be lost upon them for the lack of knowledge as to how they tasted . By the time of Edward II. , fish had , in England , become a dainty , especially the sturgeon , which was permitted to appear on no table but that of the king . In the fourteenth century , a decree of King John informs us that the people ate both seals and porpoises ; whilst in the days of the Troubadours , whales were fished for and caught in the Mediterranean Sea , for the purpose of being used as human food . Whatever checks the ancient British may have had upon their piscatory appetites , there are happily none of any great consequence upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their taste is , perhaps , too much inclined to that which is accounted solid and substantial ; but they really eat more moderately , even of animal food , than either the French or the Germans . Roast beef , or other viands cooked in the plainest manner , are , with them , a sufficient luxury ; yet they delight in living well , whilst it is easy to prove how largely their affections are developed by even the prospect of a substantial cheer . In proof of this we will just observe , that if a great dinner is to be celebrated , it is not uncommon for the appointed stewards and committee to meet and have a preliminary dinner among themselves , in order to arrange the great one , and after that , to have another dinner to discharge the bill which the great one cost . This enjoyable disposition we take to form a very large item in the aggregate happiness of the nation . 218 . THE GENERAL USE OF FISH , as an article of human food among civilized nations , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our subject with the following hints , which ought to be remembered by all those who are fond of occasionally varying their dietary with a piscine dish :  --  I. Fish shortly before they spawn are , in general , best in condition . When the spawning is just over , they are out of season , and unfit for human food . II . When fish is out of season , it has a transparent , bluish tinge , however much it may be boiled ; when it is in season , its muscles are firm , and boil white and curdy . III . As food for invalids , white fish , such as the ling , cod , haddock , coal-fish , and whiting , are the best ; flat fish , as soles , skate , turbot , and flounders , are also good . IV . Salmon , mackerel , herrings , and trout soon spoil or decompose after they are killed ; therefore , to be in perfection , they should be prepared for the table on the day they are caught . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they will keep longer . The turbot , for example , is improved by being kept a day or two . GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR DRESSING FISH . 219 . IN DRESSING FISH , of any kind , the first point to be attended to , is to see that it be perfectly clean . It is a common error to wash it too much ; as by doing so the flavour is diminished . If the fish is to be boiled , a little salt and vinegar should be put into the water , to give it firmness , after it is cleaned . Cod-fish , whiting , and haddock , are far better if a little salted , and kept a day ; and if the weather be not very hot , they will be good for two days . 220 . WHEN FISH IS CHEAP AND PLENTIFUL , and a larger quantity is purchased than is immediately wanted , the overplus of such as will bear it should be potted , or pickled , or salted , and hung up ; or it may be fried , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish , having frequently a muddy smell and taste , should be soaked in strong salt and water , after it has been well cleaned . If of a sufficient size , it may be scalded in salt and water , and afterwards dried and dressed . 221 . FISH SHOULD BE PUT INTO COLD WATER , and set on the fire to do very gently , or the outside will break before the inner part is done . Unless the fishes are small , they should never be put into warm water ; nor should water , either hot or cold , be poured on to the fish , as it is liable to break the skin : if it should be necessary to add a little water whilst the fish is cooking , it ought to be poured in gently at the side of the vessel . The fish-plate may be drawn up , to see if the fish be ready , which may be known by its easily separating from the bone . It should then be immediately taken out of the water , or it will become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kettle , to keep hot for serving , and a clean cloth over the fish , to prevent its losing its colour . 222 . IN GARNISHING FISH , great attention is required , and plenty of parsley , horseradish , and lemon should be used . If fried parsley be used , it must be washed and picked , and thrown into fresh water . When the lard or dripping boils , throw the parsley into it immediately from the water , and instantly it will be green and crisp , and must be taken up with a slice . When well done , and with very good sauce , fish is more appreciated than almost any other dish . The liver and roe , in some instances , should be placed on the dish , in order that they may be distributed in the course of serving ; but to each recipe will be appended the proper mode of serving and garnishing. 223 . IF FISH IS TO BE FRIED OR BROILED , it must be dried in a nice soft cloth , after it is well cleaned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egg , and sprinkle it with some fine crumbs of bread . If done a second time with the egg and bread , the fish will look so much the better . If required to be very nice , a sheet of white blotting-paper must be placed to rec//
