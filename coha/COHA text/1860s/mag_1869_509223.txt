MY ENEMY 'S DAUGHTER . CHAPTER XII . GREETING AND-FAREWELL . THE season was fading when I returned to London . Even in our dull and barbarous district people were beginning to make ghastly affectation of going out of town ; while in the streets which society and civilization claimed for their own the windows were darkening one after another , much as the colored lamps of an old-fashioned illumination , before the universal reign of gas had set in , used to fade and die toward morning . Lila had a rapid summary of news for me . " Nothing much " had occurred , as she phrased it ; her uncle had not yet left town ; he had had a quarrel with his daughters , and she had an idea that it was all about the Opera and Mademoiselle Reichstein . Oh , had n't I heard ? Mademoiselle Reichstein had made such a success ! Oh yes-splendid ! But she had broken off her engagement rather suddenly , and she wanted to go to the other opera-house , and there was quite a turmoil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a lawsuit . But , however that might be , Mr. Lyndon was quite infatuated about her ; and people would keep saying that he wanted to marry her ; and his daughters were in such a way about it , and there was a row in the building , Lilla believed . She was quite delighted at the prospect of a " row " continuing and growing to be something serious , for she utterly detested Mr. Lyndon 's daughters ; and she was going to be introduced to Mademoiselle Reichstein . " But if your uncle marries , Lila , that will be rather a bad thing for you ? " " Yes ; but I do n't believe it will come to any thing . I should think a woman so young , and with such a career before her , is n't going to marry a man who has daughters quite as old as herself and once and a half as tall . If I were she , I know that nothing on earth should induce me to do such a thing . Oh , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success they have , and gifts , and beauty ! And what a miserable life a girl like me is doomed to lead ! Here in this wretched old den ! I wonder how one can live through it . I never cross the bridge but I think how sad and dreary my life is , and how much I should like to drown myself if I had the courage . She must be as happy as a queen . I envy her , and I admire her too . " " Have you seen her ? " " No ; her portrait only ; and it was a wretched portrait too  --  a thing in a music-shop , with some rubbishy piece of music appended : but it made her beautiful and queenly , and sad too , I thought . But I am to see her . Is it possible you did not hear of her success down in the country ? " " Oh yes , of course I did . But I am tired of all the singers who are every one in turn to surpass Jenny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But the town is ringing with her . " " Yes , so it was with Mademoiselle Johanna Wagner ; so it was with no end of women . Where are they all now " Well , I do n't know ; but I have quite made up my mind that this one shall succeed and have a splendid career , and come to know me and be very fond of me , and take me behind the scenes , and have me in her box ; and please do n't destroy my delicious dream . I have not many pleasant dreamshere , Icantellyou . I never saw success in a living form face to face before ; and pray do n't convince me that I am not really to see it now . If you have come back cynical and out of humor , pray go away again on your travels ; although we were precious lonely without you , I can tell you that . " " Were you lonely without me " Oh yes , very . Mamma thought you would never come back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I too was very lonely . " " And you were glad when I came back ? " " Glad ? Yes , surely . You do n't suppose I was not glad ? " The frank look of kindly affectionate surprise with which Lilla spoke these words had a warming , almost a thrilling influence on me . I think I had begun of late to form a kind of vague idea that Lilla might easily be induced to fall in love with me . I certainly did not love her , and I saw nothing in her manner toward me which spoke of love . But we were so much thrown together , we were both so lonely , that I sometimes began to ask myself whether it would not be possible for me to descend from my pinnacle of sublime isolation and despair , and lift her toward my heart . I look back now upon myself and my ways at that time with the feeling which I suppose most people entertain toward their youth , curiously blended of regret and admiration and contempt . What a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and diffident ! What a fool I was , and how convinced of my own wisdom ! How miserable I was , and how happy ! What an admiration I had for my own merits , and yet what a rapturous and servile gratitude I felt to any woman who seemed to cast a favoring eye upon me ! I kept thinking complacently whether I really could accept Lilla 's love , without asking myself whether any consideration on earth could induce her to accept me as a lover ; and yet all the time I was filled with a sense of humiliating gratefulness to the girl for having condescended to be friendly and kindly to me . Of course I thought to myself , if I could make up my mind to come down from my clouds and try to love her , I I // Reichstein . I didn*t even get a glimpse of her , did you ? " " No ; I only saw bonnets . " " Oh , I wish I had seen her ! I am sure it 's she ; I am so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care a bit ; in fact , I am delighted , because now it will remind him of you ; and I did n't like to speak too much about you , or too often , be-cause- " And Lilla really blushed for the second time that day . But the blushing was useless now : the spell was broken ; my sublime self-devotion vanished . Lilla 's voice , and her evident first sensation of something like doubt or shame at being seen in my companionship , and her raptures about Mdlle . Reichstein , were enough . How full of kindness for me her whole heart was I could not but see ; and I loved her in one way for that and other things ; but the glamour of the moment was gone , and I left her when our ways divided at Pall Mall a free man , still faithful to my one memory and one love . Two or three days passed away before an evening and an event came which I can never forget . I had been in town all day , and came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stormy sunset had sunk below the horizon of the low-lying region where we lived . My room , as I entered it , was in dusk ; but I could see as I came in a letter for me standing on the chimney-piece . I went over apathetically and took it in my hand ; but the sight of the inscriptiun sent a fierce shock through me , and my head throbbed with a wild pain , born of surprise and sudden emotion . I knew that writing well . I put the letter down for a moment , just that my heart might beat less wildly , and my nerves become steady . Then I opened it and read : must tell her openly , tragically , that I was a blighted being , that I had hardly any heart left to give , and so forth . Even then I had a faint doubt whether this would not be a little too much in the style of Dickens 's Mr. Moddle , with whom I knew Lilla to be well acquainted ; and what a pretty thing it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my lachrymose avowal ! Yet the moment was tempting ; the situation became critical . Lilla had her levities and her faults , that was plain enough ; only a lover ' . eye could be blind to them , and I was not a lover . But they could surely be ameliorated , eradicated gently by patience and superior wisdom-mine , par exemple . Who did not once believe himself capable of reforming any one on whom he chose to try his hand ? I am stow to believe in my own or any body else 's reforming capabilities now ; but I suppose I then thought that , if I but condescended to attempt the task , I could remove all the weaknesses and defects from poor Lilla 's nature , and replace them by some splendid grafts of earnestness and lofty purpose . However this may be , Lilla 's friendly admission that she was lonely in my absence had sent a strange , sweet vibration through me . When this conversation occurred we were crossing St. James 's Park . Thus far our roads lay together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we always took advantage of it . It was a beautiful evening , and the light of the setting sun threw a poetical glol7 over even the arid gravel and stunted trees of the park . It was a dangerous time and hour to walk with a pretty woman , and hear her tell you that she had been lonely in your absence . I glanced at Lilla . Her eyes were downcast - only , I now believe , because the level rays of the evening sun threatened them  --  and there was a faint crimson on her cheeks . She was silent . I felt my soul dissolving in sentiment . " Then you were really glad of my return , Lilla , and you thought of me in my absence ? " She looked up quickly , smilingly , perhaps just a l qwq " EMANUEL ,  --  I have seen you again , and you did not know it . I was near you . After so many years , it was strange . I am glad we did not meet to speak . I only write this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left but-greeting , and farewell . " CrntIsTINA. " // qwq my emotions , I brought it to the window , held it in the proper light , and then " Lilly , my dear ; Lilly , my own , " broke in , thank Heaven ! the plaintive tones of Mrs. Lyndon . " Yes , mamma ; what 's up ? " " My child , you must n't stay in your wet things . Come down , dear ; I want you . " " Oh , what does it matter ! Yes , I am coming . Keep the picture for the present , Emanuel , and fall in love with it if you can . I would , I know , if I were a man . I 'll send up for it presently . " Thank God she was gone ! I could not have endured her presence much longer without betraying my feelings by a wild explosion . Yes ; it was as I expected  --  the face in the daguerreotype was the face of Christina Braun . Her dream , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was successful . Ah , God ! I hardly needed to look at the poor little daguerreotype or to struggle against the growing dusk for a clear sight of that face . By some force of ineffable conviction , the moment Lilla came into the room and spoke of Mdlle . Reichstein , I guessed the truth of which I had never dreamed before . Often as she had talked to me of Mdlle . Reichstein , the notion had never before occurred to my mind that the successful prima donna could be my lost Christina . But the letter  --  the few lines I had myself received that night-brought her back in my mind as a living reality again , and I knew the whole truth before my eyes or ears had any evidence of it . Yes , I am unable to account for it , but I knew it to be the fact that the moment Lilla entered the room and named the name of Mdlle . Reichstein , it came on me with the convincing force of a revelation that she and Christina Braun were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was successful . Did I not know that she would be some time ? And yet it came on me now with a surprise which was like agony . Like agony ? Nay , it was agony for it severed us more , far more , than death could do . She was lost , lost to me . The one hope which had lightedmylonely life soloughad utterly gone out . When , years ago , I used to hold her to my heart and talk to her of her future success , I always spoke of it as conjoined with my own , as the crown of a common happiness . In how many hours of love and hope , in how many happywalks under the summer stars , in how many silent dreams , had we pictured that triumph for her and for me ! We were to make our way together through life , to become successful and famous , and then to , come back and amaze the little town , which we magniloquently declared did not know us . Or , if we did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt-I always looked forward to our struggling and perhaps suffering together , still happy because together . Even our sudden and strange separation I had sometimes regarded as a glo rious self-sacrifice , to be crowned and rewarded some day . Many a night had I returned sick of heart and weary of foot to my London lodging , and , musing over the hours of happiness , love , and hope I had once enjoyed , been cheered and brightened by the thought that perhaps my struggles here were working in unseen cooperation with hers toward the same end . There was still at least a link of companionship , and a hope that it might draw us together one day . As my eyes were fixed upon the pale , far-off star of my hope , it was some consolation and joy to think that wherever she might be her eyes and her soul were turned toward it too . And now , behold , one half at least of our most ardent prayer has been fulfilled . She has won all we dreamed of and hoped for . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the first to hail her triumph , and now I greet it with agony and shame ; as if her success were my defeat and humiliation . And it is so . I feel that no poverty , no failure , no temporary isolation under the pressure of misfortune could raise such barriers between her and me as this fatal granting of one half our prayer . Poor people may become less poor , or they may grow familiar with poverty and learn to endure it , or they may conquer its pain by the strength of love and hope . But this revelation of her success has sounded the last of love and hope for me . Why , all these years that I have been picturing her heart as turning eternally toward mine , and panting for reunion , she has been simply making her way in the world ! She has run over some of the most thrilling chords of human experience ; she has won every height to which she aspired ; while I have been removing from one town to another , my greatest trhimph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel crushed down by grief and shame . She must despise me . She bus actually patronized me ! The great singer has granted , at the humble petition of a poor girl , a letter of introduction , to help a struggling and obscure poor devil to an engagement in a chorus . I bad imagined many a renewal of our former days , many a first greeting after our long separation , many a meeting under all conceivable circumstances of joy and of sorrow ; but I had thought of nothing like this . I had forgotten to picture myself as a broken-down beggar petitioning for help ; and her as a triumphant and splendid prima donna granting me the favor at the solicitude of a wealthy and elderly lover . Why , it seems but last week that she wrote those letters I keep in my trunk , full of such love , and tenderness , and admiration-admiration for me ! and now I am her debtor for a letter of introduction , obtained through the importunity of Lilla Lyndon and the influence of her rich uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I may receive perhaps an engagement in the chorus of the Italian Opera ! I wonder she did not send me a small present of money ! But perhaps if I obtain a place as chorus-singer through // her influence , and conduct myself properly , and never appear to recognize her , she may assist me in some other way too . She may , for example , give Lilla the making of some of her fine stage - dresses , or even the place of her own dressing-room attendant ; and if Lilla and I get married , the great prima donna may kindly become godmother to one of our children ! Ah , but if the prima donna should marry Lilla 's rich uncle , then indeed something better could doubtless be*done for Lilla than to marry her to a wretch like me ! In the bitterness of my heart it seemed as if my love for Christina had turned into hate . I was only aroused from the depth of hitter thought into which I had plunged by my own voice-by the sound of a deep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of love , disappointment , shame , hate . In the silent , darkling room the groan sounded hollow and ghostly , as in a vault of death . It aroused me as a dreamer is sometimes awakened by the sound of his own babble or laughter . I started up with the resolve to do something . Yes , there was something I could and would do-I would see her face to face . I would go to her , speak to her , ask of her how she dared to insult me with her patronage . I meant no appeal to the love of the old days , no poor and pitiful plaint , no ghastly effort to recall the dead past from the grave . No ; we are parted forever ; and I accept my doom , and make no complaint . Only she shall know that I want no patronage , and will stoop to accept non&amp; . Let her spare me that . For the sake even of the old days which she has forgotten , for the sake of the love which I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven ! - let her spare me that ! Let me but see her , speak to her , vindicate to her face my pride and my independence ; and perhaps-perhaps I then can better bear with life . Filled with this thought , I went down stairs and tapped at the door of Mrs. Lyndon 's room , endeavoring meanwhile to still the fierce beatings of my heart , and to keep some control over my voice and manner . Lilla 's voice called to me to come in . I had hoped to find her mother there , thinking I could get on better in ordinary conversation if there were three of us at it , than in mere t*te-a-t*te with my quick and sharp-eyed Lilla . But I could hear Mrs. Lyndon at work at some cookery-business below in the kitchen , and Lilla was alone . Must I confess the truth ? I almost hated the poor girl for her well-meant , kindly , luckless interference on my behalf . When I entered , Lilla was apparently in a condition of great comfort and happiness . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , which was drawn over to the table , on which a lamp threw a soft and pleasant light , and she was reading a novel . Lilla loved novel-reading . She had a great shawl gathered cozilf around her , covering her from neck to feet-indeed , I think her feet must have been coiled up under her , sultana fashion , for greater comfort ; for the night , though in summer , had turned a little chilly , and Lilla had been out in the rain on my hehalf . In fact , the p*r girl had probably taken off her wet dress , and had wrapped herself in a shawl as an easy substitute . I know she always liked to get the room to herself when she had a novel to read , for her mother was a dreadfully irritating person at such a time , full as she always was of anxious questions and perplexing recommendations . So Lilla was evidently very happy , and as she looked up at me with her beaming eyes , and her pretty head peeping above the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost , she must have been very charming to any eyes but mine . In my bitter , diseased , distracted state of mind it irritated me to see her looking so cozy and pretty and happy . I felt much as an angry man feels when , striding moodily to his fire , he stumbles over the sleek , contented , purring cat that lies basking on the hearth-rug . " Have you brought me my picture ? " asked my happy Lilla . There was an intense odor of savory fr*ing below , which I grieve to think must have conduced a good deal to the happiness of this good girl 's mind . Her harmless and comfortable little sensuousness was regaled and propitiated on the odor from below , like the good-will of the old gods on the steam of the fat sacrifice . " Yes , I have brought it . " . " Is n't it lovely ? " Very. ** " How chillingly you say that ! Men have no taste ; and I am sure it is all nonsense to say that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am quite in love with that face and hair ; and you do n't seem to care a straw about it . " " Well , I think , I believe I should like to keep it a little longer , just to study it , Lilla , and understand it a little , if you do n't object , and will leave it to me only for to-night . " Had I been asking Lilla to elope with me , or to steal her uncle 's purse for me , I could not have preferred the request in more awkward and stammering accents . My pretty one gathered herself into something like a more upright posture on the sofa , and looked at me with all the inquisitive , penetrating brightness of her eyes . " Oh yes , surely . I am very glad you want to look at it a little more , for I should be so pleased if you came to admire it as I do . But I do n't understand you to-night , somehowyou do n't seem like yourself . " " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else , Lilla . " " Nonsense ! Tell me one thing , and speak truly , and without any evasion or chaff-are you at all sick ? Because , if you are , I really must set mamma at you ; but if not-I mean , if there 's any thing wrong that is n't sickness , or catching cold , or that sort of thing-mamma would be only a bore and a plague to you , and // and , fierce in my desolate independence , fling back her patronage and her written vows of love . I longed to stand before her and say , " Look at this ruined and hopeless wretch , this ragged beggar ! This was your lover ! There are your written vows of love for him , and thus he flings them back to you , with the offer of your queenly patronage . Pauper though he may be , you shall not dare to befriend him . Let the beggar die . He shall not , at least , be fed with the crumbs that fall from your table ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door of Cox 's Hotel told me at once where Mdlle . Reichstein the singer lodged . The drawing-room windows were all dark . In my savage mood I felt bitterly disappointed at the prospect of not seeing her after all . I knocked at the door . Mdlle . Reichsteiu had gone , the servant told me . Gone where ? She did n't quite know ; somewhere abroad : to Paris , she thought . She went that evening , by the night-mail . Could she inquire , and find out for me ? She went into the house , but came back to say she really could not get to know . Mdlle . Reichstein had gone certainly to the Continent , with her maid and the other lady ; to Paris first , probably , but the lady of the house thought she was very likely going somewhere farther away . Would she return here soon ? Oh no , certainly not . Not before next season . That was all . I could find out nothing else . I turned away from the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the Power above could tell-I surely could not-how much of a secret , passionate longing to see her again , for any purpose , on any terms , was mingled with my fierce resolve to confront her , and to fling her back her agonizing proffer of service . I turned into the glaring , chattering , helllighted Haymarket  --  a stricken , hopeless wretch . I ) espite the rain that still came down pretty heavily , this Babel of harlotry was all alive and aflame with its beastly gayety . I strode my way along with head down and reckless demeanor , careless whom I jostled . Blindly I struck up against somebody , who first drew back and swore at me , and then , seizing me by my arm , exclaimed : " My heroic preserver ! would you overturn rudely the friend who longed to meet you ? What ! not know me ? How bears himself ce qros rnilitaire ? " Of course I knew him . It was my confoundyou had better be let alone . Tell me frankly , do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilla , I am perfectly well . " " Then you want to be let alone ? " " I see you have been reading . What's*he novel ? " " Oh , a charming thing- so beautiful and poetic ; only it is so sad- The Improvisalore ; do you know it ? by Hans Christian Andersen , the Danish novelist . I have just been reading such a touching passage . The hero was in love with an actress , you know , a beautiful creature , and they got separated somehow-through a mistake entirely  --  and he never saw her for years and years after ; and when at last he came to see her again ( on the stage ) , for the first time since their separation , she was quite withered and old , and her beauty was all gone . It is such a touching chapter . All her youth was gone , and her good looks , and she was old . " " Even beautiful actresses , Lilla , must get old . " " But why were they separated ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are so sad . " " Yet you read it , and think it charming . " " Yes , I ca n't help being delighted with it . But it is too melancholy . I ca n't bear to think of their long , long separation , and of her being old and withered when at last they met . I suppose such things do happen ? " " I suppose they do . I think I have heard of such separations , or read of them , perhaps . " Again Lilla looked curiously at me , and she put down the book . " Speaking of beautiful actresses , Lilla , " I said , with a supreme effort to be light and careless , " does your beautiful friend , Mademoiselle Reichstein , live far from here ; and did you walk home through all the rain ? " " Yes . It was rather a distance ; but I did n't mind in the least . " " Did you tell me where it was ? I quite forget . " " In Jermyn Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very nice place .

I had forgotten to see somebody with whom I had an appointment , and must try to find him now , late though it was . I got out of the house somehow . It was now a streaming wet night , and I tramped long enough before I could find an omnibus going my way . When I got at last to the Haymarket it was half past ten o'clock , and I was very wet . An appropriate hour , a pleasant condi- ed friend of Dover . don , in which to present myself as a visitor at " I told you we should meet again , " he said . the door of a lady 's boudoir !

GOODBOY 5 BROTHER . I AWOKE next morning with a fierce headache , a deep sense of moral debasement , and a still deeper sense of savage satisfaction in my own , degradation . I contemplated a sort of moral suicide . It seemed like an act of vengeance on her who had loved me and now cast me away , thus to crush and ruin the nature of the being to whom she onceturned in love . I am not fond of oral confessions or moral self-exposures , and therefore I hasten to say that my abasement-this my first abasementwould have been in the eyes of any ordinary Haymarket habitue a very small affair indeed . I drank too much that night  --  and for the first time-that was all . As the next day wore on , and I grew better accustomed to the quite new sense of shame , I frankly told Lilla Lyndon of my excess of the previous night , and she did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was , on the whole , rather disappointed that she took it so composedly . Moral suicide , after all , seemed a commonplace process . Yet Lilla looked grave and frowned warningly at me when she saw me going out again about the same hour that night . " Once and away , " she observed , " may n't be very bad ; but take care , Emanuel , or we shall all be sorry . " I was going into the Haymarket , where I had pledged myself to meet my friend again . A queer sort of fascination drew me toward him ; and some words he had let drop the previous night-words I now remembered but faintlyhad keenly quickened my interest in him . When we parted I promised to meet him in the colonnade of the opera-house at nine o'clock ; and at nine I was there . Very soon after he made his appearance , and I noted at once that the appearance he made was considerably changed . He was all new , from hat to boots , and his gloves were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear young friend ? " he observed , complacently . " Do n't be ashamed to confess that you have been looking at me with eyes of wonder and admiration . I am not susceptible of offense ; and the homage of the ingenuous can never displease the serene soul . I was very shabby-looking yester day , and now I am not so . I do not blush to confess that the change is not wholly owing to my own merit or industry . " " You told me you were a great hand at billiards , and indeed I saw some evidence of your skill last night . " " So you did . I think I rather astonished you and the others too . But it is n't that . You see me in the sunshine of a prosperity the source of which you could never guess . Indeed , it upsets the creed of half a lifetime with me . I should never have believed it , were I not a living proof of the fact . Listen , youth ; and , if prematurely given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn now a new and refreshing lesson of life . I am a living evidence of a woman 's gratitude . " " Glad to hear it . " " But you do n't seem sufficiently startled . Did you ever find a woman true and grateful ? " " No , by God ! " " Aha , there you are with your bears ! I thought as much . There was good earnest in that vow . Will you come with me to my lodgings ? Yes , I have lodgings near at hand ; that 's part of the mystery . Come with me . I long to be a host once more , especially to one who , like myself so evidently belongs to the brotherhood of poor devils . " We walked along Jermyn Street . When we passed the house where she so latcly lived my eyes turned unconsciously toward it and fixed themselves on it . He , too , was looking that way ; it was on the other side of the street . He noticed my gaze . " How odd ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15-I am looking at No. 15 . It ca n't have the same story for you and for me . Did you catch a sight of some pretty Mary-Jane in smart cap and ribbons ? Frivolous youth Frivolous youth made no answer , and indeed remained silent until we had reached Bury Street , and gone some way down it . My companion stopped at a door , took out a latch-key , opened the door with it , and waved to me with an air of gracious lordliness to enter . " My lodgings ! " he exclaimed ; " secondfloor front . " The second-floor front was a small , handsomely-furnished sitting-room , with bedroom en suite . My friend lighted a lamp , and motioned me to an arm-chair . " I took these rooms at once to-day , " he said , " on receiving the unexpected mark of gratitude of which I spoke to you . They are plain but commodious . The engravings on the wall are not remarkable as works of art . Let me see : The Happy Days of Charles the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in military habit .

Not even in this cursed day of quacks and shams and successful Jack Puddings can any man live by . music who does not love it .

I am going to sing a little , but smoke if you will ; it ca n't put my pipe out . " He sat down to the piano , his queer little legs hardly touching the ground , and his long arms spreading over the instrument like the wings of some ungainly bird . One could hardly expect much sweet music from so ridiculous-looking a form , surmounted by a curly black wig ; but he played with no common skill and with quite uncommon feeling and fervor . Presently he sang , in full , sweet , and solemn tones , the hymn , " Lord , remember David . " Strangely pathetic , deep , and passionate sounded that mournful appeal as it issued from the lips of this singular and scoffing little creature . I own that it touched me as much as it puzzled me , so profound seemed the sincerity with which the prayer and the plaint weut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember David ; teach him to know Thy ways ! " Every word seemed to come from him with a pathetic , passionate earnestness , so deep that one could almost for the time imagine he heard the half-despairing utterance of some generous and noble nature crying out for strength to battle against temptation , and for light to see in the world 's foul darkness . I dreaded the close of the hymn , so much did I shrink from the contrast of levity or profanity with which I felt sure he would instantly follow it . But I was mistaken . He sat silent a moment or two when he had finished , and then jumped up from the piano and walked up and down the room . After a while I could hear him repeating to himself some of the words of the prayer in a low tone , as if it refreshed him to dwell on them . " Now then , " he said at last , " you who live on music , but , I think you said , do n't care a curse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , a song from unenthusiastic lips . Come along ; make no apologies or pretexts . I dare say I have heard a hundred better singers before now , so you need not stand on ceremony . " I sang something for him , accompanying myself . He stood behind me the while , and now and then uttered a sort of growl of satisfaction or grunt of discontent . " Ah , I thought so , " he observed when I had done ; " yes , I felt sure I could not be mistaken . It was von , then , I heard at the Dover concert , Mr. Emanuel Temple ! Well , Temple , I 've heard a good many worse singers than you , and a few better . I think you ought to get on , though I do fancy somehow that you want soul . But I should say , with training and cultivation , and the advice of qualified critics-like myself , for example-you ought to make your way , Temple . I advise you to stick to it , Temple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man , Temple ; first , because I do n't admit being old ; and next , because I fear my blessing would be like that of the priest in the story , and worth considerably less than a farthing . But I have prophesied of singers before now , and prophesied correctly . I was hinting to you just now of that rare and strange thing , a woman 's gratitude , and the romantic story is a story of a singer . " The glance I had seen him give at the windows which were lately Christina 's , and the words he let fall immediately after , had aroused my curiosity . But I thought I had observed enough of his preverse and eccentric little nature to know that the more readily I displayed my curiosity the less inclined would he be to gratify it ; so I affected an air of supreme cyiiicism , and coolly said : " Then you expect me to believe in woman s gratitude ? Thank you ; but I really ca n't oblige you so far , and I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he replied , " so much as the pert affectation of cynicism in brats of boys . You know very well , Temple , that if you left your real nature to itself , it would be rather credulous and soft than otherwise . Do you know now that you struck me from the first as a good-natured and simple sort of fellow-an honest young spooney , in fact ; a lad that any smart girl might turn round her finger - a being doomed by nature to be married to a woman who will assume the wearing of the breeches as her natural right ? That is quite my idea of you , Temple ; give you my word , as a candid friend and admirer . " " Well , but without occupying ourselves in the discussion of my moral organization , what of your romantic story , and your grateful wo-man " You want to hear it , evidently . " " Not very particularly ; but if you insist- " " Well , here it is . When I came to London the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to torment my nearest relatives and raise some money , I devoted myself to/hiner a little on the side of Regent Street , thinking of the old days , Temple , when I too was a club lounger , and.a man about town , and so on . I happened to glance into a photographer 's , and there I saw a photograph of a singer , the singer of the season , the woman the two opera-houses have been squabbling about , you know . " " Yes . Reichstein . " " Reichstein , of course . In a moment I recognized her as an old friend , Temple . " // " Of yours ? She-Mdlle . Reiclistein-an old friend of yours ! " " Why not ? What are you glowering at ? She 's not an old friend of yours , I suppose ; and even if she is , you need n't look daggers at me . Did I say an old friend of mine ? Why , man , I discovered her , I invented her , I created her ! I crossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little thing going to Paris , and hoping to get on to Italy , and I took quite a paternal liking to her ; quite paternal , Temple , I can assure you , and for the good reason that she would n't allow of any other sort of liking ; and I introduced her in Paris to an Italian fellow whom I knew , a fellow who was mad on two things-Music and Italian Revolution ; and he quite took her up , and I only saw her once after in Milan , where he was having her drilled for the Scala . That , too , is four or five years ago ; and to tell you the honest truth , Temple , I never thought of the little thing from that day to the day when I saw her portrait here in this den of thieves . " " Did you go to see her ? " " Well , JI did call ; but she did n't happen to be in , and I was not very sorry perhaps , for , as you can testify , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trim about that time . But I left a letter with a mild reminder of my early services and a warm congratulation upon her brilliant success , to which it was gracefully hinted that my artistic insight had not a little contributed . Then there came an oblique , pathetic intimation that Fortune had not perhaps been quite so favorable to myself ; and in short I am afraid it was conveyed more or less vaguely that gratitude and sympathy might not unreasonably take the form of an early and liberal remittance . " I had hard work to keep down my rising disgust and contempt . " And the remittance came ? " I said , to say something , as I saw he was looking to*vard me , with his head on one side and his little beady black eyes twinkling inquiringly . " Yes , the remittance came , and it was liberal ; so *beral in fact that I have put off for the present opening the campaign I am prepared to undertake . So you perceive , Temple , that there are women who can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men so happily endowed as to he capable of exciting the sentiment of gratitude in woman 's breast . Between ourselves , the service I rendered was not very great , for I had actually at the time a sort of general and roving commission from my friend the Italian revolutionary to look out for fine fresh voices wherever they could be picked up-he had a mania for establishing an artistic parc aux ceufs of young voices - only artistic and vocal , Temple , nothing more ; he was a very Bayard or Scipio in that way ; and I simply sent the girl to him , and thought no more about the matter . What of that ? It only makes the gratitude more touching . It is a noble and a holy thing , you know , to call up such a feeling ; that sentiment in the woman s breast is cheaply bought by her at the money . " " In fact , you place her under a fresh obliga-tion ? " " Well , as you put it so , yes . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rhat is your sneer , I dare say . No , my scornful young friend , I think I shall be cont&amp;nt with that much from that quarter . Let me tell you , however , to show how little I value your feeble-minded insinuation , that I am one of those who are rather proud to be relieved by the soft and generous hand of woman . I think history records that John duke of Marlborough , and other great men , acknowledged a similar sentiment , or at least acted on it . Nature is all symbolic , Temple ; whence do we derive our earliest sustenance ? From woman 's generous bosom . Go to , then ; the meaning of Nature 's beautiful parable must be evident to all true and poetic hearts . Mine is essentially a poetic nature ; yours I perceive is not ; you look at the bare rude fact of my pocketing the young woman 's money , and do not see the delightful illustration of Nature 's noblest and oldest purpose which it symbolizes . What 's the matter with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately ; but- " " Drink brandy , Temple ; drink again . " " Do you know whether-whether this lady , Mdlle . Reichstein , is married ? " " Not I. How should I know ; and what do I care ? Very likely she is ; they all get married , these people . The flag of matrimony is a very convenient emblem . " I got up to go away ; his talk was hateful to me ; and yet I clung to any feeble hope that I might extract some knowledge about her past life and her probable future . " Do you know where she is gone ? " " Russia , I believe ; but I am not certain . Somebody told me that some rich Londoner , a member of parliament and patron of the drama -I do n't know him , but , as Charles Lanib said , d- him at a venture-was always to be seen hanging after her , and making rather an idiot of himself . " " Yes , I have heard of that , " I interposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is-a Mr. Lyndon . " " What did you say ? " exclaimed the little creature , leaping from the chair in which he sat , and standing upright before me . " What name did you give ? " " Lyndon  --  a Mr. Lyndon , a member of the House " Earth and hell ! Tommy Goodboy ! Tommy Goodhoy himself ! Of all the hypocrites of this most hypocritical age , Tommy Goodhoy is the greatest hypocrite . Among all the scoundrels in an age of scoundrelism , no scoundrel like Tommy Goodboy . Look at me , Temple ! I am Goodboy 's victim : Goodboy stands in my shoes ; Goodboy wallows in my money ! He is F // the head of the family , the respectable citizen , the model man , the patron of every charity , the Ma*cenas of art ; and I am the ruffian , the 6utcast , the billiard-room hanger-on , the frightful example ! " An idea at last began to dawn upon me as to the identity of my queer friend . Were these , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his ? Lilla 's face , and Mr. Lyndon 's ? Is this creature , this half-crazed sensualist , this selfish loafer , this wretch living on alms and extorted money , this combination of Hircius and Spungius , my poor , pretty , kindly Lilla 's father ? He was now walking up and down the room , throwing his arms wildly about like a little madman . I went up to him as gently and kindly as I could . " You , then , " I said , " are the elder brother of Mr. Lyndon ? " " Who the devil else do you think I am ? Do you suppose I am proud of being that coldhearted , sneaking humbug 's brother ? Yes* I am his brother  --  the brother whom he cheated out of house and home , out of his father 's favor , oat of his inheritance , out of every thing that could make life worth having . Was I an idle , good-for-nothing scapegrace ? Of course I was . But what was he ? All that I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How did he ruin me at last ? By betraying to my father the one good thing I ever did in all my life . It 's as true as light , Temple . My father cut me off without a rap because I had been d-d fool enough to marry a pretty girl instead of seducing her . Whatever misfortune may happen to you in life , Temple , never do a virtuous action . Be warned in time by me . When I die , or hang myself if there can by any means be raised money enough to set up a tombstone over me , let my epitaph describe me as the man whom Respectability and Virtue outlawed and robbed , because he had once in his life - only just once-failed to behave like a scoundrel . " I was on the point of blurting out some hasty words which would have admitted my knowledge of Lyndon 's wife and daughter . Fortunately , however , I restrained myself in time , and recollected how more than doubtful it was whether they would be the better for any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poor , poor Lilla ! with her good heart , her sweet kindly nature , her harmless vanities , and at least not unnatural hopes and aspirings , to think that this unfortunate and worthless wretch , whose chief or sole excuse seemed to be his half-crazed eccentricity , should be her father ! I always fancied that the poor girl cherished in her secret heart sonte fond romantic hope that the lost mysterious father might one day reappear , redeemed , penitent , and splendid , to claim his daughter and lead her into the sphere which she thought her rightful place . I know that she always regarded her father as some brilliant aristocrat who had stepped down from his high rank for love of her poor mother - some Egmout or Leicester to whom Mrs. Lyndon was the Clara or Amy Robsart ; and he filled her imagination even in his fall rather as an archangel ruined than as any commonplace sinner . I knowshe often hinted as much to me-that she secretly yearned for him , and waited for him to come some day and redeem her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cares and small intelligences ; and to bring her to a sphere where there should be bright surroundings , and ease and luxury , and a life with many tints in it , and vivid conversation , and books worth reading , and men who could pay graceful homage and whom one could marry , and women well-dressed and vivacious and lovely . Often I had thought to myself , in my odd moods of whimsical melancholy , that Lilla 's phantom father and my phantom Christi*ia beguiled and befooled us both alike , and to as little purpose ; and I wondered whether , if Lilla could know my story and my dreams as well as I knew and guessed hers , she would not look on me with the same kind of wondering pity wherewith I regarded her . And nOw , behold , another bond of companionship and union ! Lilla had found for me my lost love : lo , I have found her lost father ! See , Lilla , there he is-that broken-down , ridiculous reprobate yonder , that billiard-room loafer , that ruined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and down the room , blaspheming as he goes ! " Mr. Lyndon ! " " My dear young friend , a thousand pardons ! You recall me to myself , and remind me that I am not playing the host to perfection . I am , I fear , a little egotistic sometimes ; but what would you have of a man who has had to contend against the world and his wife-his own wife , Temple ; not the world 's , mind-for so many years ? Adversity , Temple , is the parent of egotism . Pardon my distraction . " " I was not thinking of that ; I was going to ask a question . " " Propound . I reserve to myself the right of not answering , should the answer tend to criminate me . In a moral point of view , Temple , it would not be easy for me to give any answer relating to my own personal history which would not tend a little that way . But go on , youth of the gloomy brow . " Only this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " " Did I admit so much ? My old weakness - too much confidence and candor . No matter . You ask me what about my wife ? Give you my word , Temple , I do n't know ; I do n't , really . I have been away so long , knocking about the plains of windy Troy , that I positively do n't know where to find my Penelope now that I have come back . " " Should you like to ? " " Oh dear no-not in the least . I could n't think of it ; she 's doubtless very happy , and I // should grieve to disturb her : or perhaps she is not very happy , and then the sight of her would disturb me . No , Temple , a man of refined taste shrinks from unidealizing-if you will allow me to use such a word-from unidealizing the poetic perfectness of married life by too much of vulgar intercourse with its prosy details . " " Still , as she is your wife- " " Just so ; there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it would be quite a different thing : but she is my wife , and I know it to my cost . I paid a heavy debt for the sweet privilege of calling her so , and I am not ardent for any more of her mild society . You look horrified , I perceive . Frankly , I do n't care . " " She may be poor and lonely- " " My good fellow , am not I poor and lonely ? Could any one be poorer than I was the other day , and shall be soon again , no doubt ? Am I not lonely , or worse than lonely , in having no companionship but that of a silly and moping young moralist like you ? Do you think adding two poor people together produces wealth ? Put together cipher and cipher , and see how much better off you are for the result . Besides , have I not told you I know nothing , absolutely nothing , of her whereabouts ? " " But suppose- " " I do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Temple , I ca n't live on pap ; some men can , I believe ; I ca n't . Food for babes does not nourish me . I livtid on it long enough , and you see the result . If there is any thing in life I utterly detest , it is puling , meek , mawkish goodness . I rage at it ; it sets me mad . I long to tear and tatter it . " " But your child-your daughter ? " " Did I tell you I had a daughter ? Really , you find me in a strangely-confiding mood tonight . Well , I have a daughter ; at least , I know I had , and I believe I still have . What then ? " " Only one might have thought- " " Yes , one might , no doubt . One might have thought that the father 's heart would melt ; that he would burst into sobs , and exclaim , in broken accents , My angel chee-ild ! - that he would weep on the neck of the good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a respectable member of society . In the domestic melodrama , Temple , from which I perceive already your principal ideas of life are drawn-what 's the price of the gallery-seats in the Victoria ? - that sort of thing does , I believe , familiarly occur . But this , Temple , is real life ; and we are not on the stage of the Victoria . I make no doubt my daughter 's a very wellbrought - up and proper young woman , who would look with horror on such a reprobate as I am ; and I can not say that the voice of Nature shrieks very powerfully or plaintively in my ears . No , Temple , it wo n't do . " " Then have you really no care for any thing ? " " Yes ! " he answered , in vehement and fierce tones-I had long been expecting an outburst of passion- " for money and for freedom ! For money to spend , and for freedom to spend it in ! Give me these  --  and I will have them , wherever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life gives for enjoyment , from moonbeams and music up to absinthe and madness . But I will have money , and I will be free ! I will , I will ! I do n't care who or what comes between me and my way of life ; I sweep it out of my road and go on . Do n't talk to me of nature and domestic affections , and drivel of that kind ; I do n't want them-I 've had enough of them to last my time . Hate is much more in my line than love . I came to London for the double purpose of screwing money out of my thriceaccursed brother , and disgracing myself and him at the same time ; and I will do it too ! I would have done it before now but that that fool of a woman sent me this money , which I mean to enjoy before I go to work . Pleasure first , business afterward with me . Go to the devil with your talk about my wife and my chee-ild ! What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Tommy Goodhoy ? If you are , go back to him and tell him what my answer is : tell him I 'll make his respectability blush yet , if I can not make his heart of pumice-stone feel . " " I never spoke a word to Mr. Lyndon in my life . " " Then perhaps you are an emissary from my wife . If you are , go back and tell her the best thing she can do is to leave me to myself . " " Listen to me , Mr. Lyndon , and do n't waste on me all these rhapsodies and ravings . Keep them for somebody on whom they might produce some desirable effect . I assure you they move me only to sincere pity and contempt . I never knew until twenty minutes ago who you were , and I never cared . I spoke to you on no one s behalf , at no one 's suggestion . I spoke to you only because I thought it hardly possible you could be wholly degraded below the feelings of average manhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I leave you , and only hope we may not meet any more . " He threw himself into a chair , leaned back , and burst into a peal of mellow laughter . lf I know any thing of reality as distinguished from acting  --  and I ought-this was no affectation or sham , but genuine , honest , hearty , irrepressible laughter . He rolled about in his chair , and stamped his feet , and shook his shoulders like a pigmy Sam Johnson in a fit of unconquerable mirth . I stood up , angry , and ashamed of being angry-thinking what a great deal I would give , if I had it , to feel myself at liberty to kick him ; and all the time considering whether I could in any possible way serve poor Lilla 's interests by keeping on good terms with him . " I protest , Temple , " he said at last , when he was able to speak from very laughing , " you do delight me . As good as a play ? Man , you 're worth a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression of your face that time , to I // watch your gesture , to hear the earnest eloquence of your language , was the finest treat any man with a rich sense of humor could possibly have . You are the most delightful of young men- " " And you are the most scandalous of old reprobates . " " Coarse , Temple , coarse , and not half so fervent as your graver style . But I see you are waxing wroth at being laughed at . Well , I dare say no one likes being laughed at , and of course the more ridiculous he is the less he likes being treated as such , and I really do n't want to offend you ; so let us consider the subject as dropped . Take a little more brandy ? No ? What , you are not going ? Positively offended ! Well , of all the idiots it has ever been my fortune to meet you are the most conspicuous . Get out ! Go to all the devils ! Confound you , I am a gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Insult a gentleman ! By Jove ! what 's the world coming to ? " All these concluding sentences were rattled at my ears as I was descending the stairs . Until I had fairly quitted the house I could hear him swearing and objurgating . Then , as I passed under the window , I found that he was having recourse to the piano to cool his wrath . I paused a moment out of curiosity . He was singing , to his own accompaniment , " I know that my Redeemer liveth . " I hurried away . The words , the sweet , pathetic , devotional tones , sounded in my ears like hideous blasphemy . I walked slowly home , my mind occupied with the uncomfortable discovery I had made , and much perplexed to know whether there was any thing I could or ought to say or do with regard to it . It clearly seemed that I had no right to inflict useless torture on Mrs. Lyndon or Lilla by telling them any thing about my knowledge of this wretched man . From what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had come to London for the purpose of shaming his brother into supplying him with new funds , and it was evident that there was no extravagant escapade or exposure of which the little wretch would not be capable . On the whole , then , it seemed to me that the best thing I could do would be to see Mr. Lyndon at once , and put him on his guard . Mr. Lyndon too might , like a sensible man of the world , feel inclined to buy off his disreputable brother even for Lilla 's sake  --  to settle on him some pension on condition of his living out of England or out of Europe ; and , disagreeable as the task would be , I would willingly undertake the work of negotiation and arrangement in order to ward off vexation and shame from these two poor women , who had been so kind to me . Yes , that was the best thing to do , and there was no time to he lost , as Mr. Lyndon would be leaving town immediately . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtrude myself on Lilla 's uncle , I determined to see ' him , in this cause , next day .
