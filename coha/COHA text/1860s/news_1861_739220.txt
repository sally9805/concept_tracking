txt Those earnest and ardent Republicans whose impatience at the bare suggestion of the withdrawal of the force from Fort Sumpter is unbounded , and who denounce the Administration in advance for its supposed purpose of " surrendering " to the Secessionists , forget that Congress has given to the President no authority to raise and equip armies to defend the fortress , and that the blame , if blame exists , must rest upon the shoulders of a majority of Congress , and upon the late President BucneNest . It is now almost physically impossible to relieve Fort Sumpter with the slender means at the disposal of the President . Equally unreasonable are the complaints that no steps are taken to collect the revenue in the seceded States . It is well known that the revenue laws on the statute books contemplate the active cooperation of the people of the several States in their enforcement , as well as the acquiescence of the State authorities . There must , by the terms of the law , be Custom-houses in the seaport towns , with collectors and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be stored " in bond , " until the merchant chooses to draw them forth . Suits may arise for attempted frauds upon the Government , which suits must be tried before the Federal Courts and local juries . But in the ( seceded States there are no Courts , the Judges , Marshals and District-Attornies having resigned and acknowledged exclusive allegiance to the State authorities . It is , therefore , impossible to collect the revenue in the ordinary way . Mr. Bripartem , of Ohio , in view of this state of things , proposed to apply a remedy , known to the public as the Force bill . This bill proposed to collect the revenue at the mouths of the bays and rivers , by stationing vessels of-war at convenient points , to command the entrances . This bill was held by Mr. B. to be essential to the object it had in view , and was urged upon the House of Representatives with his usual zeal and ability ; but that body neglected to take it up and pass it , thus leaving the President without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a hostile attitude to the Government . Mr. BINGHAM now consistently admits that the enforcement of the revenue laws has become impracticable by the failure of Congress to take up and pass his bill . At the door of that body , therefore , the fault lies , and not at that of the Executive mansion . Mr. LINCOLN has been left powerless to enforce the laws , and yet by the ignorant and unthinking he is held responsible for the failure . But I need not repeat , that I deem the policy of peace wise in itself , and sure to accomplish the overthrow of secession . I regard it as fortunate , therefore , if it were not designed , that the late Congress failed to provide armies and navies , and force bills for the collection of the revenue in the Cotton States . The fact must not be lost sight of , regret it as we may , that our Federal Government is theoretically and practically weak . It was hoped by the frqmers of the Constitution that the defects ' of federal forms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holland and Germany , had been provided against in that instrument ; , and very probably the Government , which they organized , would have possessed sufficient strength , if the subjects of it had been homogeneous , or even free . But it has become evident that a confederacy of slaveholding States can never be strong and compact . Slaveholders , from an innate consciousness that their cherished institution is contrary to natural justice , are prone to be jealous , especially of communities which condemn and proscribe Slavery . There can be no such thing as perfect harmony between them . Like the wicked , they " flee when no man pursueth , " and are given to much babaling upon " the reserved rights of the States , " and to the assertion of the right of resibtaEce to the Federal Government , as often as their favorite policy of Slavery extension is threatened with overthrow . While this element of evil remains in our system , we must be patient under indignities to Fedoral authority . The President and Cabinet are conscious of this fact , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now disposed to adopt a policy of peace and forgiveness towards the rebels , as best calculated to destroy the morbid sympathy for them , which to a greater or less degree pervades the Border and Middle States . Since writing the above , I have just seen a gentleman directly from Richmond , who represents the excitement as intense . The Secessionists were quaking with fear at the idea of the Federal Government surrendering Fort eumpter , while the Unionists were in ecstaciec of joyous hope . Both parties agree in the opini , on that the surrender of the forts to the ** would be a death-blow to them . The demagoolee wear elongated faces at the certain rain which , this measure of peace would bring upon them . My informant is a gentleman of high intelligence , and , with ample means of information , he gives it as his opinion , which at the same time was the opinion of all parties in Richmond , that the withdrawal of the troops from Forts Sumpter and Pickens would leave the Secession traitors without a pretext . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while holding onitp the other , would fail to command the respect and confidence of the friends of Union , since it would be imputed to cowardice rather than to a love of peace . If the possession of Fort Pickens were retained , the Secessionists could still point to it as the badge of Northern tyranny and aggression , while it would strip the surrender of Fort Sumpter of all grace , and render it clear to the world that it was the sheer act of necessity . The surrender of the forts should be placed on grounds of policy . It would be a declaration to the world that the American Government rests on the consent of the governed , and that public opinion is the great bond of union , and sanction of Federal authority , as it regards the States . This is the popular Fourth of July view of our Government , and if it is not an entirely satisfactory basis of public authority and public credit , it is at any rate the best we have at present , or can have , while Slavery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Government is nursed by them with a feeling of pride , as if it sprang from a high and chivalrous sense of power and personal dignity in the citizen ; but in reality this jealousy is the result of timidity . It indicates conscious weakness and fear , such as we see the feeble and decrepit exhibit , when jostled by a sword . The Free States , in which the love of liberty is genuine , have no such apprehensions of continual danger from Federal power . They have their local interests , which they are not slow to defend and protect ; but they have no fear of their liberties being overthrown by the Federal Government ; and it is singular that almost the only instances in which Free States are brought into collision with the General Government , are those in which the propagandists of Slavery ' , with loud professions of States ' Rights upon their lips , have attempted to encroach on the reserved rights of the States and people .               @ @ @ @ @ @
