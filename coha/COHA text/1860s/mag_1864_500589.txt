txt HINTS TO THE AMERICAN FARMER . IT does not so much signify what a man does for a livelihood , provided he does it well . The people must sooner or later learn this catholic doctrine , or one element of republicanism will never be knit into our character . The doing it well is the essential point , whether one builds a ship or writes a poem . Does the American farmer do his work well ? And , if not , wherewith shall he be advised , persuaded , encouraged , and taught to do better or the best ? It is estimated that three fourths of the people of the United States are agriculturists , and nearly all the rest laborers of some sort dependent upon them . Every economist knows that the interests of agriculture , manufactures , and commerce are one and indivisible . tion onward one step at least .

' He who by word or deed helps one , Daniel Webster calls him the founder helps all , and thereby moves civiliza- of civilization . ' // Is it at all necessary that the spring in the hills should be cool , clear , and pure , and wind its way over a granitic soil , through green meadows , beneath the shading forest , into a sandy basin , to form a beautiful lake in a retired , rural retreat ?

The condition of the farmers is the postulate by which the sagacious economist will foreteJi the future prosperity of the nation they represent . This is what the American farmer should have presented to him from every stand-point . It is lamentable that this vocation should be so sadly represented by the most of those who are engaged in it . This occupation of farming is the noblest work which can engage the attention of man . Off of his farm , whether it be large or small , the farmer , by diligent and intelligent cultivation , can gather whatever he or the world needs ; what the world needs for its manufactures and commerce ; what he needs for his personal comfort , pleasure , or the gratification of his natural t*v. /*es ;  --  the two crops which furnish the daily bread to the material and spiritual nature of man ;  --  the green fields , than which nothing is more beautiful ; the sweet song of birds , their gay plumage , their happy conferences , thoir winged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky , ever above us , ever changing , grand at morning , magnificent at evening , hanging like a gracious benediction over us ; the flowers , ever opening their petals to the sun , turning their beauty on the air , to delight , instruct , and bless mankind ; - indulging his taste for art , in the plan of his farm and buildings , . their claims to architectural skill ; in the planting of his fruit and ornamental trees , in groves , in lines , in copses ; * in the form and make of his fishponds , shady voL . Y.-39 walks , grottos , or rural seats for quiet resort for study , comfort , pleasure , or rest . The ancients paid great attention to the cultivation of the earth . Many of the best men of Greece were agriculturists . Mind was given to it , and great progress was made in the improvement of implements ; in the method of cultivation , and in the additional yield of their farms . The Romans continued for a long period to improve on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grecians , until the political condition of their country destroyed all freedom and independence of action and thought . The best and greatest men of all ages and countries , statesmen , scholars , kings , and presidents , have loved it , followed it , and labored for its advancement . Do noble minds stoop to ignoble vocations , and become identified with them ? This nation , not yet a century old , can boast , as among the statesmen-farmers , of Washington , Adams , Jefferson , Patrick Henry , Franklin , Jackson , Calhoun , Clay , and Webster , and many others , the least of whose greatness of character was not that they loved nature , or knew the charm of agricultural pursuits . The occupation has become sanctified by their devotion to it . We all know the sympathy and love of the late lamented Prince Albert for the vocation of farming , and the liberality with which , on his model farm , experiments were verified which in any nianner might contribute to the interests of the farmer . He even entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearly exhibitions of the Royal Agricultural Society . There is something very suggestive of nobility in this vocation of farming , when the brightest intellects of the nation bow in homage to the strength of mother earth , and seek by severe thought , study , and experiment , to assist a further yield of her kindly fruits , or persuade her to bestow a portion of her bounties , * so long withheld , upon the // wooing husbandman . It marks agriculture as the first and highest calling for the development in the highest degree of the nation and of mankind . Every man may have his plot of ground , in the cultivation and adornment of which he may realize the pleasure which accompanies the calling of amateur farmer , horticulturist , or florist , in which he is in constant communication with nature and her beauty . In it there is no corruption , but rather goodness . ' How kindly nature seems to have dealt with some of the old farmers who even now tread the broad earth , beloved and reverenced by all who know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honesty of manner ; what kind dispositions ; what charity of judgment ; what tenderness of heart ; what nobility of soul seem to have concentrated in each one of them ! They are the gifts of nature , gathered , developed , interpreted , personified in man . They are our aristocracy . From them through generation after generation shall flow the pure blood of the best men in republican America . Ages hence , the children who enjoy the privileges of this republic , and endeavor to trace their lineage through history to find the fountain of their present American stock , will as surely meet with no unpleasant encounter , nor be compelled to forego the search from fear of mortification , as they trace their family line through long generations of intelligent American farmers . Superficial Young America ' and our best society ' may smirk , snicker , sneer , and live on , slaves to fashion and the whims of Mrs. Grundy , in their fancied secure social position for all time . But ere long the balance of man 's better judgment the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great people , will weigh in opposite scales the artificialities , the formalities , the selfishness of popular social circles , against the honesty , the naturalness , the simplicity , the worth of the practical lovers of nature ; and the result shall be the inscription upon the wall which made their prototypes of old tremble , reflecting upon them also its ghostly and terrific glare . Were it not for the infusion almost constantly going on , from the country , of fresh blood into the veins of the diseased body politic in our largest cities , destruction , disgrace , and financial ruin would early mark the spot where once flourished a proud and sinful people . In farming , man has to do with nature . Out of doors he spends the greater portion of his life . His intelligent eye takes in the beautiful objects of land and sky , sea and mountain ; his refined ear , by practice and cultivation , delights in the exquisite harmony of the birds , the music of the wind , the murmuring of the sea , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers , springing in the utmost profusion at his feet-peeping at early spring from beneath the lately fallen snow , an earnest that life yet remains under the clods of apparently exhausted nature - their continued offerings through the long and sultry days of summer ; the trees putting on their rich and glowing robes at autumn , ripening for their restoration to the bosom which gave them life and which yielded them to us for a season , clothing all the hills , valleys , and mountains with the gorgeous colors from nature 's royal laboratory . ' Who can say this beauty and this pleasure are for nought ? The intelligence which observes and loves these sights hesitates not , nor can it be deterred from reflecting upon their Source . The farmer , turning the sod with the plough , and dropping the grain into the newly turned furrow , expects life amid the decay of the clod . The favorable sunshine and shower , the gentle dews and heat of summer bring forth , after a partial decay of the seed , the blade , the ear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The perfume of the newly turned earth exhilarates and refreshes the spirits of the laborer and // what appears the hardest work becomes a welcome task . Toll here has its immediate recompense . Always peaceful , always contented and cheerful , always kind , there is no want of companions whose presence is delightful and never burdensome . The oriole , the swallow , the sparrow , the cawing crow , the chipmuck , or the squirrel will not desert him . He can always rely upon their presence while engaged in the necessary preparation for the harvest . The flowers are with him , and the perfume from the blossoms in the fields and orchard will fall like incense upon his receptive spirit . His thoughts will turn involuntarily to the Origin of all Good , from which have come to him , in so great abundance , the favorable conditions for happiness and peace . Contemplating in silence and alone , away from the distractions of busy life in cities , the disappointments of politics , and the petty disturbances and quarrels of a more crowded existence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tree grows slowly but surely beside his door , under whose shadows he has rested at the close of the summer 's day , and , with his family about him , reflected upon his finished labors , and planned the work for to-morrow . The wonderfUl power of the Creator , and the matchless argument for His existence , as displayed in the beauty of the heavens , are spread before him . Its presence is a blessing to him . This tree , a century ago the tiny seed of the beautiful elm , which floated perhaps on some zephyr , or , tossed by some summer gale , dropped noiselessly into its cradle at this door-fortune favored its growth , and protected it from the injuries of chance or intent . It patiently grew and spread its hospitable arms , as if to embrace the surrounding neighborhood , and is now a protection and safeguard , a blessing and a continued promise of the watchfulness and care of the Father . This honest , grateful , simple soul has learned from it the beauty of a patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion of his weary moments , never failing to return at spring the beauty so ruthlessly torn at autumn ; rendering to his just soul the contentment of the welldoer in this world 's works , yet still progressing , growing , and enlarging in its sphere of usefulness and trust . The regularity in the procession of the seasons , the dependence and faith inculcated by their never-failing return of the bounties asked of them for his proper observance of their demands , have rendered order a controlling power with him , and punctuality has become a virtue . The large independence of the concerns of men has not made him autocratic in manner , nor indifferent to progress in the condition of mankind . Faithful to the duties of the good citizen , and to himself he has not forgotten his moral duties toward the social polity , and neither state , nor church , nor school , nor family , but feels the influence of his tender care . Health has been always with him and on his side . Cleanliness is throughout his household , and scrupulous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a good farmer 's home so cheerful , is his . Such is the intelligent , patient , thorough cultivator of the soil . Is there not a nobility of nature in it , far surpassing that which the false standard of society gives to man l What profession , business , or vocation of any sort engaged in by man , carries in its legitimate course these joys , this peacefulness , this hope ? Here are not the anxieties , nor perplexities , nor fears , nor losses attendant upon the occupations in the more crowded haunts of business . Plenty fills his garners ; happiness attends his footsteps ; peace crowns his life . We would that this good soul might truly represent every farmer on our soiL We are compelled to acknowledge the shprtcomings of this class of // persons , upon whom so much depends , and , by showing in which direction their prominent faults lie , endeavor to persuade them to accept a better standing in the social state , where they are so much needed . A luau shows in his daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there made upon him in his young and growing life are proverbially deep and abiding . The circumstances which develop the character of the good farmer in one town , are the circumstances which develop the good farmer wheresoever he may be ; but the circumstances which make so many of our farmers at this day , coarse in speech , vulgar in manners , untidy in dress and in the arrangement of their fi*rms and their habitations , ignorant , thoughtless , thriftless , indifferent , wasteful , lazy , are not arbitrary circumstances , but pliant and yielding , willing instruments , in the hands of good workmen , to raise , elevate , and instruct all who can be brought within their influence . The agriculturist who combines with his knowledge and skill in farming a reflncd taste for the simple elegancics which may form a part and parcel of every well-ordered homestead , will often grieve at the neglect , indolence , and ignorance , shown by the too sad condition of many of our socalled American farms . The farmhouse of this waste place we call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dusty highway which passes through the country . Unpainted , or unwhitewashed , without a front fence , without shade trees or flowers near it , or by it , it stands like a grim and sombre sentinel , guarding a harsh and lonely existence , at once a prophecy and a warning . There is no home feeling in it . Everything connected with the internal movements or the external management of the place is in full view : the woodpile with its chips scattered about over a radius of fifty yards ; a number of old , castaway , and condemned vehicles lie where they were left after their last use ; mounds of rubbish and old brushwood , weeds , soiled clothing , farming tools , and implements of husbandry , are here and there , uncared for , unnoticed , and neglected . The poultry , pigs , and cattle he possesses , wander about the door , at once front and rear , or , unobstructed by any serviceable fence , trespass upon the newly planted field or unmown meadows , getting such living as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doors , the barnyard without a gate or bars , and in full view from every passer by . The sty and the house drain-in fact , every necessary outbuilding-is in plain sight to the public , on the sunny side of the house , or as near the front of it as is possible for circumstances to permit . The airs of summer and of autumn come to the delighted senses of the residents impregnated with the incense ' of these sweet surroundings , which , like Gray 's unseen flower , are not destined To waste their sweetness on the desert air . ' And who are the delighted occupants of this charming spot ? The external apppearance and condition of things too sadly betray their character . The man is coarse and vulgar in speech and in manners ; untidy , careless , and uncleanly in person and dress ; ignorant , lazy , and perhaps intemperate , with no thought beyond the gratification of his bodily wants and desires . Slang words and obscene are his daily vocabulary ; selfishness his best-developed trait , and want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like unto him , or worse , either by nature or association . Without taste , modesty , good sense , or natural refinement , she accompanies her dear Silas in his round of life , sympathizing in his lowness , his common feelings , and his common complaintsslatternly in her dress , rude in speech , coarse in manner , slovenly in her household duties . These two creatures , with their children , too often call themselves farmers , agriculturists , or tillers of the // soil . The poet Cowper well describes them in his poem representing the country boors ' gathered together at tithing time at the residence of their country parson . These thriftless people complain that they can make no money on their farms , and but barely a living ; and for the very good reason that the man or woman who attempts to carry on a farm in this way through the year deserves no money or profit , nor barely a living from such a method of work . He was born here . The new soil , at the time his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good one , too ; but this heir to the ancestral acres unfortunately married the slatternly daughter of a loafing neighbor , and their conservatism will not allow them to vary from the track of cultivation so well worn by his father , and forbids his learning any other methods , or accepting any new ideas from any source , though they may be sustained in the practical advantage gained thereby by the most successful farmers in his town , and may be learned any time from the weekly agricultural gazette published at the capital of his State . Book farming he scouts . The books upon agriculture , which every good farmer should read and study , and prove , will cost him perhaps ten dollars . By them his farm shall become his pride , his support , his wealth . But this dull man can not , or will not , learn that in the dreaminess of his humdrum life , passed for thirty years or more upon his farm , capital , industry , science , thought , and study have been at work , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done to make the earth more gladsome , and the hearts of the children of men more thankful to the Giver and Bestower of all our blessings . Away , then , with this cant , prejudice , and sneering about book farming . ' As well cry out against book geography , or book philosophy , or book history , or book law . Chemistry , botany , entomology , and pomology unite the results of their researches in their various directions , and , while seeking apparently different ends , yet converge toward the grand centre of &amp; systematic and scientific agriculture . This laggard has not yet learned that it is his business and duty to cultivate the earth , and not exhaust it ; to get two blades of grass this year where but one blade grew before ; to gather thirty bushels of corn from the acre which produced but twcnty bushels last year ; to shear three pounds of wool off the sheep which five years ago ga*ce ? *+ two pounds , and so on . He thinks to see how near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or with how little labor he can carry his farm through the year and not starve . The poverty of the whole establishment , man and wife , and children , and stock , their uncleanliness and unhealthfulness , are but the just results of such a mode of living . They have their deserts . Ye can not gather grapes of thorns , nor figs of thistles. * This illustration may seem exaggerated , the example too extreme . We would that its semblance could not be seen in all wide America . What power , what influences , or what teachings will work the change in the habits of life of those who thus pretend to cultivate the earth ? What shall bring them to a clearer realization of their position , their duties , their opportunities , their prospects ? This lethargy of ignorance , indifference , and laziness must be shaken off and laid aside in the immediate future , by study and education , by active interest and participation in every discovery or invention which benefits agriculture ; by the exercise of sound judgment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by economy in the disposition of everything available upon the estate which may be brought into profitable employ ; by thrift in every operation which concerns the success of the vocation as tillers of the soil , and by temperance and frugality in the habits and character // of the family living . Concentrate your labor , not scatter it ; estimate duly the superior profit of a little farm well tilled , over a great farm half cultivated and half manured , overrun with weeds , and scourged with exhausting crops : so we shall fill our barns , double the winter fodder for our cattle and sheep , by the products of these waste meadows . Thus shall our cultivation become like that of England , more systematic , scientific , and exact . ' An Englishman belies one of the*best traits of his national character if he denies himself all participation in rural life . It is a part of greatness to seek a gratification of this innate longing for the pursuit which is most conducive to virtue and happiness . ' Edmund Burke , the patriotic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1798 , says : I have just made a push , with all I could collect of my own and the aid of my friends , to cast a little root in the country . I have purchased about six hundred acres of land in Buckinghamshire , about twenty-four miles from London . It is a place exceedingly pleasant , and I propose , God willing , to become a farmer in good earnest . ' Great skill , ingenuity , and success in cattle breeding , and in drainage , have resulted , in England , from a long series of experiments , extending through many years ; and great and wonderful progress in the discovery and analysis of soils and manures . The scientific men of France and Germany have also added much to this invaluable information of how to get more bread and meat from the earth , and do much , in their researches in the direction of pomology and entomology , to increase the agricultural knowledge *fthe world . America gladly tenders her most gracious homage to these devoted men , and hastens to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is to their persistent efforts , to their unshaken faith , that agriculture has become elevated to the dignity of a science . ' This vocation of farming in good earnest , with success and profit , is not fun , but downright work . It is work , but no more persistent , constant , studious , or thoughtful than that which is demanded by any of the other callings in life , none of which has or can have such delightful compensations as this . Careful experiments should be made in chemistry , analyzing thereby each germ , plant , flower , and fruit into its component parts ; analyzing the soil of our farms , and learning thereby its various wants its value , and what crop it will best support , and of which it will give the largest yield ; teaching us what manures are the most valuable , how prepared , and how to be used for the greatest profit . Botany and entomology can unite their labors and discover the germs and development of our grasses , and the insects which feed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of birds , and their value to us as protectors of our gardens and fields ; and pomology will instruct us in the culture of fruit . Thus shall science and philosophy enlarge their duties and help the farmer in his devotion to his noble work . The public press shall herald far and wide each new discovery , each new suggestion , and the results of each new experiment , not in the technical language of the schools , but clothed in the simplest vernacular , which alone can make such study valuable to practical men . Heretofore too much attention has been paid to the bread-producing capacity ' of our country , to the neglect of its as necessary meat-producing capacity . ' Hence much of our best breadproducing soil is becoming exhausted . The old tenants are leaving their once fertile fields , now poor in soil yielding comparatively nothing , and are emigrating to the West , beyond the banks of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers , trusting that the natural richness of the new hunting grounds ' they seek and find is inexhaustible . This policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and has begun to tell sadly , in the diminished crops , upon the farming districts of Ohio , Indiana , and the other near Western States . To be the successful introducer in a new country of a new and improved breed of cattle , requires capital , sound judgment , study , and patient toil . Much must be considered with reference to the peculiarities of the soil and climate , and of the animals , with regard to the object for which they are needed , whether the dairy , the plough , or the shambles . Happily , America is not without men whose wealth , intelligence , tastes , and sagacity have enabled them to perceive our present wants in this respect , and who have assisted in preparing for them . The great wealth of these gentlemen has been well expended in the outlay and risk attending the extensive and valuable importations of the best breeding cattle and sheep which they have made into this country from time to time from England and the continent of Europe . We are already reaping the advantages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous importations . Scattered as they are throughout the country , infusing the best blood of Europe 's choicest stock into our natives , ' they so improve our cattle and sheep as to raise them to the highest degree of excellence and value . It is a circumstance of which every American may be proud , that Mr. Thorne has been so successful in breeding , from his imported stock , cattle which he has sent to England , and which have there borne off the prize as the best breeders in the world . There are no indigenous breeds of either cattle or sheep in this country . The only animals of the bovine race found here when this continent was discovered were the buffalo and the musk ox . The natives ' are a heterogeneous mixture of various breeds , introduced from time to time for differeat purposes , and allowed to cross and recross , breed in-and-in , and mingle as chance or convenience dictated . The cattle and sheep were procured at different times from the continent of Europe , from England , and the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food . The first cattle brought here are said to have been introduced by Columbus . The Spaniards afterward brought over others , from whence no doubt sprang the wild cattle of Texas and California . About the year 1*53 , the Portuguese took cattle to Newfoundland , of which , however , no traces now remain ; and in the year 1000 , Norman cattle were brought into Canada . In the year 1611 , Sir Thomas Gates brought from Devonshire and llertfordshire one hundred head of cattle into Jamestown and thirteen years later , Thomas Winslow imported a bull and three heifers into Massachusetts . Thus was begun the importation of cattle for service and food into this country , which has continued to this day , not always , however , with the just discrimination as to the geographical and climatic peculiarities of the different animals which was and is necessary for the highest success of the movement . Happily , the various agricultural societies and publications , contributed to and supported by our most intelligent farmers , are diffusing wider and wider , each year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , among our agricultural citizens . An admirable and carefully written article upon Select Breeds of Cattle and their Adaptation to the United States , ' nl ) peared in the United States Patent Office Report for 1861 , to which we would call our readers ' attention . It should be studied by every person interested in the economical prosperity of our country . It conveys , in a simple and perspicuous style , the results of the various experiments in breeding , in both England and America , which latterly have become so judicious and accurate as to be now almost based upon principle . Hereafter there 591 // will be no apology , but that of stupidity and ignorance , for the farmers who neglect the most obvious rules of success in their occupation . The idea , now become well known , must become a fact with them , and they must raise no more poor horses or cattle or sheep , because it costs no more to raise good ones , which are much more profitable either for the dairy , for service , or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for converting herbage into money , ' says Daniel Webster . The great fact to be considered is , how can we manage our farms so as to produce the largest crops , and still keep up the condition of our land , and , if possible , place it in course of gradual improvement ? The success must depend in a great degree upon the animals raised and supported on the farm . ' It is auspicious for our country that the interest in sheep raising is becoming wider and deeper . The value of wool imported into the United States , in 1861 was nearly five millions of dollars . The value of imported manufactured woollen goods was more than twenty-eight millions of dollars , less by nearly ten millions of dollars than the importations of 1860 . Taking the last three years as a basis of calculation , we have had an annual importation of from thirty-five to forty-five millions of pounds of manufactured and unmanufactured wool , being the product of thirteen millions of sheep . ' The annual increase of population in the United States requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an annual deficiency of wool of from forty to fifty millions of pounds , so there need be no fear of glutting the market by our own production . The investigation might be extended much farther . It remains for the farmers and legislators to see to it that we receive no detriment by the long continuance of this home demand without the home supply . The instrument is in their own hands . Our farmers must teach their children the potential influence of kindness to dumb animals and to birds . By it they will conquer what of viciousness , ugliness , or wildness is often the character of their beasts of burden ; and they will find , by the almost total eradication of the destructive flies and insects which are the scourge of their crops , the value of the lives of birds and toads to their farms . Setting aside for the present the consideration of the moral virtues which are thus inculcated , and which are so consistent with a proper devotion to this benign art of peace , ' we mention a few facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The birds and toads devour insects , worms , and grubs , and wherever they are absent , grubs , worms , and insects are greatly multiplied , and the crops suffer . The harvests of France , in 1861 , suffered so by the ravages of the insects which it is the fuuction of certain birds to destroy , that the subject attracted the notice of the Government , and a commission was appointed to inquire into the matter and report what legislation was expedient . The commission had the aid of the experience of the best naturalists of France , M. St. Hilaire , M. Prevost , and others . Their preliminary report gives three classifications of birds : First , those which live exclusively upon insects and grubs ; second , those which live partly upon grubs and partly upon grain , doing some damage , but providing an abundant compensation ; third , the birds of prey , which are excepted from the category of benefactors , and are pronounced to be noxious , inasmuch as they live mostly upon the smaller birds . If the arrangements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a wholesome equilibrium of destruction . The birds would kill so many insects that the insects could not kill too many plants . One class is a match for the other . A certain insect was found to lay two thousand eggs , but a single tomtit was found to eat two // swallow devours about five hundred insects a day , eggs and all . A sparrow 's nest in the city of Paris was found to contain seven hundred pairs of the upper wings of cockchafers . It is easy to see what an excess of insect life is produced when a counterpoise like this is withdrawn ; and the statistics collected show clearly to what an extent the balance of nature has been disturbed . Thus the value of wheat destroyed in a single season , in one department of the east of France , by the cicidomigie , has been estimated at eight hundred thousand dollars . The cause of this is very soon told . The French eat the birds . The commissioners , in their report , present some curious statistics respecting the extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late been carried . They state that there are great numbers of professional huntsmen , who are accustomed to kill from one hundred to two hundred birds daily ; a single child has been known to come home at night with one hundred birds ' eggs ; and it is also calculated and reported that the number of birds ' eggs destroyed annually in France is between eighty millions and one hundred millions . The result is that the small birds in that country are actually dying out ; some species have already disappeared , while others are rapidly diminishing . ' These facts contain valuable suggestions to our own countrymen . In this instance , as in many such like , observation is a better and more profitable master than experience . Our farmers can increase the value of their estates , and bring pleasure and peace to their homes , by more special attention to the outward adornment of their dwellings ; by cultivating a garden , planting orchards of the best selected fruit , and trees for shade , shelter , and ornament , about their farms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thereby gives hostages to life , but he who cuts 593 one down needlessly , is a Vandal , and deserves the execration of every honest man for all time . Learn not to value the bearded elm , the murmuring pines and the hemlocks , ' the stalwart oak , or the beautiful maple , by cubic measure , but by the height of the great argument ' they force upon us by their presence , their beauty , and their power . Plant for to-day , and for your children ; plant for another age , ' and thereby do a good office* to the coming generations of men . No man but is better for living in the presence of great trees . In one of those most delightful volnines of the Spectator , we find a paper , written by the pure and noble Joseph Addison , in which are well told the pleasures and profits of planting : It must , ' he says , be confessed that this is none of those turbulent pleasures which are apt to gratify a man in the heats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is more lasting . Nothing can be more delightful than to entertain ourselves with prospects of our own making , and to walk under those shades which our own industry has raised . Amusements of this . nature compose the mind , and lay at rest all those passions which are uneasy to the soul of man , besides that they naturally engender good thoughts , and dispose us to laudable contemplations . ' What charming associations linger about the homes of the great men of our history , whose tastes led them into the country ! The grand old trees at Monticello , ' at Ashland , ' at Fort Hill , ' at the Hermitage , ' at Sunnyside , ' at Cooperstown. at Marshfield , at Mount Vernon , seem to take upon themselves somewhat of the voice of the old hospitality ' which graced their presence in the days that are passed ; and the visitor now wanders with emotions of awe and sadness , in paths by copses and groves and streams , in those quiet retreats of nature , planted and preserved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . JJim ts to the American Farmer . // Place the dwelling at a distance from the road , and in the position , if 1 ) ossible , from whence the best view of the whole farm can be obtained , mindful also of the charms which nature has spread before you , of mountain , or hill , or plain , or river , or sea . Plant the orchard on a slope toward the south , and not too far away . The barn and yard and outbuildings should be behind the house , or far enough away to protect the inmates from any annoyance therefrom . Let the approach to the house be by a long avenue , bordered by majestic trees , planted by your own hands . The lawn or garden should be well cared for in front .

It is the greatest refreshment to the spirits of man ; without which buildings and palaces are but gross handyworks ; and a man shall ever see that when ages grow to civility and elegance , men come to build stately sooner than to garden finely ; as if gardening were the greater perfection . I do hold it in the royal ordering of gardens , there ought to be gardens for all the months in the year ; in which severally things of beauty may be there in season .

' With all the advantages which the discoveries of natural science offer to the farmer of this century , it will little avail his successors unless he strives to educate his children . It is a very mistaken and lamentable notion-now , alas ! too prevalent-that a liberal education is necessary alone to those who intend to enter upon a professional life . May the time be not far distant when farming may become a profession which takes its rank with the rest , if it does not lead them , in the public opinion . It was first supposed , very singularly , that the clergy ought only to be favored with an education in science and the classics ; afterward the legal profession arose to sufficient dignity for it ; and finally the physician , the guardian of our health , the student and philosopher of our bodies , arose to his noble position in the affairs of this life ; while the agriculturist , the supporter of all we have or wish for here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside or forgotten , and the demand upon him for the best culture of the earth altogether neglected . We have to congratulate ourselves that our Government has left it with each State by itself , whether , by the non-acceptance of its gift of public land as foundations for agricultural colleges , they will longer forego the opportunity of giving our young farmers a thorough scientific agricultural education . Until such a system of study can be arranged , let the farmers themselves commence the work of self-education . Agricultural societies and farmers ' clubs , in which are gathered together the best farmers of the States , offer the best opportunity for intercommunication , thorough diseu*-sion and observation , and dissemination of all new discoveries , facts , or theories which may be made beneficial to all . These are the only means by which farmers can compare opinions and found sound judgments for their future labors .

Our best farmers can do a great deal , by contributing facts of their own knowledge , to raise the standard and worth of such periodicals . It only needs the feeling of personal interest in this matter to procure for each farmer whatever books are necessary to a perfect understanding of his special work . They must soon learn that the education of their children is the best investment they can make of the value of their services . They should be taught , by example , by reading , and observation , the general success in life of those who plant and water and reap ; and the general failure of those who attempt to gain an early or a late fortune in money by entering the marts of more active and more crowded competition .

The peace , quiet , and contentment of a cheerful home ; the charms of nature , free , unobstructed , lovely ; the generous bestowal of an unostentatious hospitality ; ' the patient spirit of him who waits upon the accustomed return of the seasons ; the attachment , the joy and pleasure of looking upon the broad acres , the shaded walks , the beautiful landscape , planted , improved , and protected by his own hand ; the herds of favorite cattle and sheep which love his coming , the kindly tones of his voice , the gentle stroke of his hand ; the respect paid by friends and neighbors to the venerable man who waits only the termination of a virtuous life ; the faith in the sacred covenant , that while the earth remaineth , sunshine and shower , summer and winter , seedtime and harvest shall not fail , ' are his who lives through long years devoted to this , rightly followed , noblest of all occupations-farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seed , shall doubtless come again with rejoicing , bringing his sheaves with him .
