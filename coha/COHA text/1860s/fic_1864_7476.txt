Sill , Edward Rowland , 1841-1887 : As flowers return when winter 's o'er from Poems , in Triennial Meeting of the Class of Sixty-One ( 1864 ) Tune  --  " Auld Lang Syne . " As flowers return when winter 's o'er , As swallows homeward sail , As wanderers to their father 's door , So we come back to Yale . So we come back to Yale , my boys , So we come back to Yale ; As pilgrims come to seek their home , So we come back to Yale . Like maidens round the sweet May-flowers , First blossoms of the year , We come to hail this bud of ours , With kindly welcome here . With kindly welcome here , my boys , With kindly welcome here ; In joy to hail this babe of Yale , With kindly welcome here . Of wine with maddening fire lit up , O , child , we bring thee none ; We pledge thee in the silver cup The love of Sixty-One . The love of Sixty-One , my boys , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The love of Sixty-One . Thy little hands that scarce can span The goblet 's silver side , Shall cleave , with sinews of a man , The world 's tumultuous tide . The world 's tumultuous tide , my boys , The world 's tumultuous tide ,  --  Shall cleave apart , with fearless heart , The world 's tumultuous tide . Thy tender feet shall tread life 's way , Nor falter , nor shall fail , Till thou hast found , some summer day , The pleasant paths of Yale . The pleasant paths of Yale , my boys , The pleasant paths of Yale ; And thou shalt tread , as we have trod , The pleasant paths of Yale . With closer love thy class shall cling Than ever class hath done ; For it shall clasp within its ring The child of Sixty-One . The child of Sixty-One , my boys , The child of Sixty-One ; They 'll love , in memory of our love , The child of Sixty-One . The silver cup no smallest drop Of bitterness shall hold ; Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessings manifold , my boys , With blessings manifold ; Like Hebe 's cup , to gods held up , With blessings manifold . Its silver chime , each festal time , Where cup to cup is rung , Shall softly sing , with echoing ring , The songs that we have sung . The songs that we have sung , my boys , The songs that we have sung ; The talks we 've had , the hearts we 've wed , The songs that we have sung . A lingering perfume , as of wine , It ever shall exhale The fragrance of our years of thine ,  --  Our happy years at Yale . Our happy years at Yale , my boys , Our happy years at Yale ; Our life 's best wine to hallow thine , Our happy years at Yale . Sill , Edward Rowland , 1841-1887 : Of all the folks the sun can see from Poems , in Triennial Meeting of the Class of Sixty-One ( 1864 ) Tune  --  " An ' I shall be its Dad . " Of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The happiest three are Bradliee , The baby and its ma ! The baby and its ma , The baby and its ma ,  --  The happiest three are Bradliee , The baby and its ma . We all might dance upon our laps A boy as well as Brad , If we had taken the proper steps ,  --  And do n't we wish we had ? And do n't we wish we had , etc . There 's many a house with kindred piled Since Adam was a lad , But never yet was Christian child So many uncles had . So many uncles had , etc . The College fathers by this boy Are made grandfathers hale , And Alma Mater , to her joy Is now grandmother Yale . Is now grandmother Yale , etc . Not all our band around us stand As when we here begun , But though we stray by twos and threes , We still are Sixty-One . We still are Sixty-one etc . Though less each year we gather here , Till half our ring is gone , Yet even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sixty-One . ' T would still be Sixty-One , etc . And though this generation goes , As sinks the evening sun , Like stars shall rise bright baby-eyes To cheer old Sixty-One . To cheer old Sixty-One , etc . The bachelors must live close by To those who wives have won , To kiss the girls , and toss on high The boys of Sixty-One . The boys of Sixty-One , etc . The rippling music of their laugh We 'll join with pipings old , And mingle with our grizzled hair Their sunny locks of gold . Their sunny locks of gold , etc . And through a little mist of tears We 'll look upon their fun . Till still the men of sixty years Are boys of Sixty-One . Are boys of Sixty-One , etc.
