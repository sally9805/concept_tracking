txt HEALTH IN THE HOSPITAL . IN preparing to do the duty of society towards the wounded or sick soldier , the first consideration is , What is a Military Hospital ? No two nations seem to have answered this question in the same way ; yet it is a point of the first importance to them all . When England went to war last time , after a peace of forty years , the only idea in the minds of her military surgeons was of Regimental Hospitals . There was to be a place provided as an infirmary for a certain number of soldiers ; a certain number of orderlies were to be appointed as nurses ; and the regimental doctor and hospital-sergeant were to have the charge of the inmates . In each of these Regimental Hospitals there might be patients ill of a great variety of disorders , from the gravest to the lightest , all to be treated // by the same doctor or doctors . These doctors had to make out statements of all the diets , as well as all the medicines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and it might be said that arrangements had to be separately made for every individual patient in the whole army . The doctors went to work each in his own way , even in the case of epidemics . There was no knowing , except by guess , what diseases were the most to be apprehended in particular places or circumstances ; nor what remarkable phenomena of disease were showing themselves on any extended scale ; nor what improvements could be suggested in the treatment . There was no possibility of such systematic cleanliness and such absolute regularity of management as can he secured by organization on a lar* , e scale . Yet the medical officers preferred the plan to any other . One plea was , that the medical officers and the patients were acquainted with and attached to each other : and this was very true . Another consideration was , that each surgeon liked to have his field of duty to himself , and found it an advantage to have a large variety of ailments to treat , to the constant improvement of his experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regimental Hospital best , and this was clear proof that it was the best . They could at that time say also , that every soldier and every doctor had a horror of General Jiospitals , where the mortality was so excessive during the Peninsular War that being carried to the General Hospital was considered the same thing as being sentenced to ( leath . Such being the state of opinion and feeling in the profession , it naturally happened that British army-surgeons stuck to their Regimental Hospitals as long as they could , and , when compelled to cooperate in a General Hospital , made the institution as like as possible to a group of Re*imental Hospitals ,  --  resisting all effective organization , and baffling all the aims of the larger institution . In busy times , no two Regimental Hos pitals were alike in their management , because the scheme was not capable of expansion . The surgeon and his hospital-sergeant managed everything . The surgeon saw and treated the cases , and made out his lists of articles wanted . It was his proper business to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make the returns , and keep the accounts , and post up all the documents : hut professional men do not like this sort of work , when they want to be treating disease ; and the books were too often turned over to the hospital-sergeant . His indispensable business was to superintend the wards , and the attendance on the patients , the giving them their medicines , etc. , which most of us would think enough for one man : but he had besides to keep up the military discipline in the establishment , - to prepare the materials for the surgeon 's duty at the desk , - to take charge of all the orders for the diet of all the patients , and see them fulfilled ,  --  to keep the record of all the provisions ordered and used in every department , - and to take charge of the washing , the hospital stores , the furniture , the surgery , and the dispensary . In short , the hospital-sergeant had to be at once ward-master , steward , dispenser , sergeant , clerk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a six-sided official , more or fewer of his duties were deputed to the orderly , or to anybody within call . Nobody could dispute the superior economy and comfort of having a concentration of patients arranged in the wards according to their ailments , with a general kitchen , a general laundry , a dispensary and surgery , and a staff of officials , each with his own distinct business , instead of as many jacks-of-all-trades , each doing a little of everything . Yet the obstinacy of the fight made by the surgeons for the system of Regimental Hospitals was almost insuperable . There was no desire on any hand to abolish their hospitals , which must always be needed for slight , and also for immediately pressing cases . What was asked of them was to give way when epideniics , or a sudden influx of wounded , or protracted cases // put a greater strain upon the system than it would bear . The French , meantime , had three sorts of hospitals ,  --  the Divisional ones coming between the Regimental and the General . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those which may last weeks are referred to the Divisional ; and those which may last months , with prospect of recovery , to the General Hospital . The Sardinian plan was nearly the same . The Russians had Divisional Hospitals at various stations ; and all cases were carried to them . The Regimental Hospitals are wherever the regiments are . The advantage is , that aid can be immediately rendered , - not only in case of wounds , but of cholera , in which it is desirable to lay a patient down in the nearest bed to which he can be conveyed . The disadvanta. *es are the hap-hazard quality of the site , the absence of quiet and seclusion , and the liability of being near the scene of conflict . These things cause the French to prefer the Divisional Hospital , which , while still within reach , is set farther back from the force , in a picked situation , and managed on a large scale and with nicer exactitude . The General Hospital is understood to be at the base of operations : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a system of transport , not only good of its kind , but adequate to any demands consequent on a great battle , or the spread of an epidemic in the camp . The nearer the hospital is to the active force , the better , of course ; but there are conditions to be fulfilled first . It must be safe from the enemy . It must be placed in a permanent station . It must be on a good road , and within immediate reach of markets . It ought also to be on the way home , for the sake of the incurable or the incapacitated who must be sent home . In the Regimental hospital , the surgeon may be seen going from the man who has lost a finger to a fever patient ,  - -  and then to one who has ophthalmia , - passing on to a fellow raving in delirium tremens , - next to whom is a sufferer un der bronchitis , who will not be allowed to go out of doors for weeks to come ; and if half a dozen are brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the officials do not know which way to turn . It is possible that the surgeon maybe found making starch over the kitchen fire , because there is nobody at hand who understands how to make starched bandages ; or he may be at the desk , casting up columns of figures , or writing returns , when he is urgently wanted at the bedside . Such things can hardly happen now ; but they have happened within ten years . The Russians , meantime , would be carrying all manner of patients to one of their hospital-stations , - each sufferer to the hospital of his own division . The Freiich would leave the men with scratches and slight diarrhea and delirium tremens in the Regimental Hospital , - would send the fever and bronchitis and scorbutic patients to the Divisional ,  --  and any gravely wounded , or rheumatic , or other very long cases to the General Hospital at the base of operations . Such arrangements , however , are of no use , if the last be not so organized as to render it fit to supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes which the others can not even propose . When doctors and soldiers alike shuddered at the mention of the General Hospital as a necessary institution at or near the seat of war , they were thinking of what they had seen or beard of during the Peninsular Campaigns . There were such infirmaries wherever there was a line of march in Spain ; and they seemed to be all alike . hospital gangrene set in among the wounded , and fever among the sick , so that the soldiers said , " To send a poor fellow to the hospital is to send him to death . " Yet there was nothing else to be done ; for it was impossible to treat the seriously sick and wounded at the spot where they fell . During that war , nearly twice the number which composed the army passed through the hospitals every year ; and of these there were known deaths to the amount of thirteen thousand five hundred ; and thousands // more were never the same men again . When the case was better understood , - as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mortality in the hospitals barely exceeded that of the Guards in their barracks at home ! Recovery had become the rule , and death a remarkable event . General Hospitals had come to surpass all other means of curing patients , while fulfilling their own peculiar service to society through new generations . What are the functions of General Hospitals , besides curing the sick and wounded ? some readers may ask , who have never particularly attended to the subject The first business of such institutions is undoubtedly to restore as many as possible of the sufferers brought into them : and this includes the duty of bringing in the patients in the most favorable way , receiving them in an orderly and quiet manner , doctoring , nursing , feeding , clothing , and cleaning them , keeping their minds composed and cheerful , and their manners creditable , promoting their convalescence , and dismissing them in a state of comfort as to equipment . This is the first duty , in its many subdivisions . The next is to obviate , as far as possible , future disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is to improve the science of the existing generation by a full use of the peculiar opportunities of observation afforded by the crop of sickness and wounds yielded by an army iu action . To take these in their reverse order . There must be much to learn from any great assemblage of sickness , under circumstances which can he fully ascertained , even at home , - and much more in a foreign climate . The medical body of every nation has very imperfect knowledge of classes and modifications of diseases ; so that one of the strongest desires of the most learned physicians is for an improved classification and constantly improving nomenclature of diseases ; and hospital - records afford the most direct way to this knowledge . Thus , while the phenomena are frittered away among Regimental or unorganized General Hospitals , a well-kept record in each wellorc*anized hospital will do more than all other means to promote the scientific understanding of disease . The statistics of disease in armies , the ascertainment of the numbers who sicken and who die of particular diseases , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be now appreciated ; but what can the regimental surgeon do towards furnishin* , any trustworthy materials to such an inquiry ? A dozen doctors , with each his smattering of patients , can learn and teach but little while they work apart : whereas a regular system of inquiry and record , in action where the sick are brought in in battalions , is the best possible agency . Not only are these objects lost when surgeons are allowed to make the great hospital a mere receptacle for a cluster of small and desultory hospitals , but the advantages of a broad study of diseases and their treatment are lost . Inestimable facts of treatment are learned by watching , at the same time and in the same place , a ward full of patients ill of the same disease . People of all countries know this by the special learning which their physicians obtain in large civil hospitals : and the same thing happens in military hospitals , with the additional advantage that the information and improved art tend to the special safety of the future soldiery , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There has long been some general notion of the duty of army-surgeons to record what they saw in foreign campaigns ; but no benefit has been reaped till of late . The works of French field-surgeons have long been justly celebrated ; but I do not know that in the statistics and the nomenclature of disease they have done much more than others . The English surgeons carried or sent home in 1810 a mass of papers about the Walcheren fever , and afterwards of the diseases of the Peninsular force : but the DirectorGeneral of the Medical Department considered // such a bulk of records troublesome , and ordered them to be burnt ! Such an act will never be perpetrated again : but di rectors will have a more manageable mass of documents to deal with henceforth . With a regular system of record , at a central station of observation , much more may be done with much less fatigue to all parties . But how is it to be done ? may well be asked . In the hurry and confusion of a war , and amidst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what can the surgeons of the hospital be expected to do for science , or even for the improvement of medical and surgical practice ? - The answer is seen in the new arrangements in England , where a statistical branch has been established in the Army Medical Department . Of course , no one but the practisiug surgeon or physician can furnish the pathological facts in each individual case ; but this is what every active and earnest practitioner does always and everywhere , when he sees reason for it . His note-book or hospitaljournal provides that raw material which the statistical department is to arrange and utilize . The result will be that a flood of light will be cast on matters affecting the health and life of soldiers and other men , in regard to which we mi* , ht have gone on groping for centuries among the confusion of regimental records , without getting what we wanted . As to the method of proceeding , I ma*y have something to say farther on . Meantime , we must turn to the primary object of the institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounded and siek of the army . In the case of active war , foreign or civil , the General Hospital is usually an extemporized establishment , the building a makeshift , and the arrangements such as the building will admit . In Spain , the British obtained any houses they could get ; and the soldiers were sometimes crowded into half a dozen of them in one town . In the last war , the great buildings at Scutari were engaged three months before they were wanted for extensive use ; so that there was plenty of time for making them clean , airy , warm , and commodious , and for storing them with all conveniences . This was not done ; and the failure and its consequences afford a lesson by which every people engaged in war should profit . A mere outline of what was not done at Scutari may be an indication of what should be done with all convenient speed elsewhere . There was a catgut manufactory close at hand , which filled the neighborhood with stench . Half a dozen dead dogs festered under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the aqueduct for six weeks . The drain-pipes within the building were obstructed and had burst , spreading their contents over the floors and walls . The sloping boarded divans in the wards , used for sleeping-places , were found , after the building became crowded , to be a cover for a vast accumulation of dead rats , old rags , and the dust of years . Like all large stone buildings in the East , it was intolerably cold in winter , with its stagnant air , its filthy damps , and its vaultings and chill floors . This wonderful building was very grandly reported of to England , for its size and capacity , its imposing character , and so forth ; and the English congratulated themselves on the luck of the wounded in having such a hospital . Yet , in the next January , fourteen hundred and eighty were carried out dead . It appears that nobody knew how to go to work . Everybody writes to somebody else to advise them to " observe " ; and there are so many assurances that everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been no leisure to effect anything . One thinks that this , that , or the other should be attended to ; and another states that the matter is under consideration . It was some weeks before anybody got so far in definiteness as to propose whitewash . Somebody understood that somebody else was intending to have the corridors scoured ; and representations were to be made to the Turkish authorities about getting the drain-pipcs // mended . The Turkish authorities wished to employ their own workmen in putting in the stoves ; and on the 18th of December the responsible British in question . This was a month after large companies of wounded and sick had been sent in from the seat of war . Even then , nothing had been done for ventilation , or , on any sufficient scale , for putting the poor sufferers comfortably to bed . These things confirm the necessity of a regulated cooperation between the sanitary , the medical , and the military officers of an army . The sanitary officer should be secure of the services of engineers enough to render @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitable . As soon as any building is taken possession of for a hospital , men and their tools should be at command for exploring the drains and making new ones , - for covering or filling up ditches , - for clearing and purifying the water-courses , and leading in more water , if needed ,  --  for removing all nuisances for a sufficient distance round , - and for improving to the utmost the means of access to the house . There must be ventilating spaces in the roof , and in the upper part of all the wards and passages . Every vaulted space , or other receptacle of stagnant air , should have a current established through it . All decaying wood in the building should be removed , and any portion ingrained with dirt should be planed clean . A due water-supply should be carried up to every story , and provided for the bathrooms , the wash-houses , and the kitchen . Every edifice in America is likely to be already furnished with means of warmth ; and the soldiers are probably in no danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18th of December . Next comes the consideration of storeplaces , which can be going forward while busy hands are cleaning every inch of ceiling , walls , floors , and windows within . There must be sheds and stables for the transport service ; and a surgery and dispensary planned with a view to the utmost saving of time and trouble , so that medicines and utensils may be within reach and view , and the freest access lowed to applicants . The kitchens must have the best stoves and boilers , dressers and scales , and apparatus of every kind that is known to the time ; for more lives depend on perfect food being administered with absolute punctuality than upon any medical treatment . There must be large and abundant and airy store-places for the provisions , and also for such stocks of linen and bedding as perhaps nobody ever dreamed of before the Crimean War . The fatal notions of Regimental Hospital management caused infinite misery at Scutari . In entering the Regimental Hospital , the soldier carries his kit , or can step into his quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be supplied with shirts and stockings , towel and soap , brushes and comb . This supposition was obstinately persevered in at Scutari , till private charity had shamed the authorities into providing for the men s wants . When the wounded were brought from the Alma , embarked on crowded transports straight from the battle-field , how could they bring their kits ? Miss Nightingale , and benevolent visitors from England , bought up at Constantinople , and obtained from home , vast supplies of body- and bed-linen , towels , basins , and water-cans ; and till they did so , the poor patients lay on a single blanket or coarse canvas sheet , in their one shirt , perhaps soaked in blood and dirt . There were some stores in the hospital , though not enough ; and endless difficulty was made about granting them , lest any man should have brought his kit , and thus have a double supply . Amidst the emergencies of active war , it seems to be an obvious provision that every General Hospital should have in store , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can occupy the beds , - the consideration being kept in view , that , where the sick and wounded are congregated , more frequent changes // of linen are necesssary than under any other circumstances . The excellent and devoted managers of the hospitals of the Union army need no teaching as to the daily administration of the affairs of the wards . They will never have to do and dare the things that Miss Nightingale had to decide upon , because they have happily had the privilege of arranging their hospitals on their own principles . They will not know the exasperation of seeing sufferers crowded together on a wooden divan ( with an under-stratum of dead rats and rotting rags ) while there is an out-house full of bedsteads laid up in store under lock and key . Not being disposed to acquiesce in such a state of things , and failing in all attempts to get at the authority which had charge of the locked door , Miss Nightingale called to an orderly or two , and commanded them to break open the door . They stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently there were as many men in bed as there were bedsteads . Her doctrine and practice have always been , - instant and silent obedience to medical and disciplinary orders , without any qualification whatever ; and by her example and teaching in this respect she at length overcame the jealousy and prejudices of authorities , medical and military : but in such a case as the actual presence of necessaries for the sick , sent out by Government or by private charity for their use , she claimed the benefit , and helped her patients to it , when there was no other obstruction in the way than forms and rules never meant to apply to the case . What the jealousy was appeared through very small incidents . A leading medical officer declared , in giving evidence , that the reason why the patients ' meals were sometimes served late and cold , or halfcooked , was , that Miss Nightingale and her nurses were forever in the way in the general kitchen , keeping the cooks from the fire : whereas the fact was , that neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen , on any occasion whatever . Their way was to have a kitchen of their own . The very idea of that kitchen was savory in the wards ; for out of it came , always at the right moment , arrowroot , hot and of the pleasantest consistence , - rice puddings , neither hard on the one hand nor clammy on the other ,  --  cool lemonade for the feverish , cans full of hot tea for the weary , and good coffee for the faint . XVhen the sinkin* sufferer was lying with closed eyes , too feeble to make moan or sign , the hospital spoon was put between his lips , with the mouthful of strong broth or hot wine which rallied him till the watchful nurse came round again . The meat from that kitchen was tenderer than any other ; the beef-tea was more savory . One thing that came out of it was a lesson on the saving of good cookery . The mere circumstance of the boiling water being really boiling there made a difference of two ounces of rice in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrowroot used . The same quantity of arrowroot which made a pint , thin and poor , in the general kitchen , made two pints , thick and good , in Miss Nightingale 's . Then there was the difference in readiness and punctuality . Owing to cumbrous forms and awkward rules , the orderlies charged with the business were running round almost all day about the food for their wards ; and the patients were disgusted with it at last . There were endless orders and details , whenever the monotonous regular diet was departed from ; whereas the establishment of several regular diets , according to the classifications in the wards , would have simplified matters exceedingly . When everything for dysentery patients , or for fever patients , or for certain classes of wounded was called " extra diet , " there were special forms to be gone through , and orders and contradictions given , which threw everything into confusion , under the name of discipline . The authority of the ward would allow some extra , - butter , for instance ; and then a hgher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came there , would throw it out of the window , as " spoiling the // men . " Between getting the orders , and getting the meat and extras , and the mutual crowding of the messengers , some of the dinners were not put on the fire till an hour or two after the fainting patient should have had his meal : and then , of course , he could not take it . The cold mutton-chop with its opaque fat , the beef with its caked gravy , the arrowroot stiff and glazed , all untouched , might be seen by the bedsides in the afternoons , while the patients were lying back , sinking for want of support . Probably the dinners had been brought up on a tray , cooling all the way up-stairs and along the corridors ; and when brought in , there was the cutting up , in full view of the intended eaters , - sometimes on the orderly 's own bed , when the tables were occupied . Under such a system , what must it have been to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck , with their hot-water tins , hot morsels ready-cut , hot plates , bright knife and fork and spoon , - and all ready for instant eating ! This was a strong lesson to those who would learn ; and in a short time there was a great change for the better . The patients who were able to sit at table were encouraged to rise , and dress , and dine in cheerful company , and at the proper hour . It was discovered , that , if an alternation was provided of soups , puddings , fish , poultry , and vegetables , with the regular beef dinner , the great mass of trouble about extras was swept away at once ; for these varieties met every case in hospital except the small number which required slops and cordials , or something very unusual . By this clearance , time was saved to such an extent that punctuality became possible , and the refusal of food almost ceased . All these details point to the essential badness of the system of requisitions . In the old days , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in peace times , when soldiers and their guardians had not enough to do , and it was made an object and employment to save the national property by hedging round all expenditure of that property with difilcul ties , the system of requisitions might suit the period and the parties . Amidst the rapid action and sharp emergencies of war it is out of place . It was found intolerable that nothing whatever could be had , - not a dose of medicine , nor a candle , nor a sheet , nor a spoon or dish , nor a bit of soap ,  --  without a series of permits , and applications , and orders , and vouchers , which frittered away the precious hours , depressed the sick , worried their nurses , and wasted more of money 's worth in official time , paper , and expensive cross-purposes than could possibly have been saved by all the ostentatious vigilance of the method . The deck-loads of vegetables at Balaklava , thrown overboard because they were rotten before they were drawn , were not the only stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scutari hospitals had become healthy and comfortable , there was a thorough opening-out of all the stores which had before been made inaccessible by forms . INo more bedsteads , no more limejuice , no more rice , no more beer , no more precious medicines were then locked away , out of the reach or the knowledge of those who were dying , or seeing others die , for want of them . One miserable consequence of the cumbrous method was , that there was no certainty at any hour of some essential commodity not falling short . It would have been a dismal day for the most suffering of the patients when there was not fuel enough to cook " extras , " if Miss Nightingale had not providently bought four boat-loads of wood to meet such a contingency . It was a dreadful night in the hospital , when , as cholera patients were brought in by the score , the surgeons found there were no candles to be had . In that disease , of all maladies , they had to tend their patients in the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conceived . Every great influx of patients was terrible , whether from an epidemic or after a battle ; but experience and devotedness made even this comparatively easy before the troops turned homewards. // The arrival of a transport was , perhaps , the first intimation of the earlier battles . Then all was hurry-skurry in the hospitals ; everybody was willing to help , but the effectual organization was not yet ready . Of every hundred on board the transport , an average of ten had died since leaving the Crimea . The names and causes of death of these men ought to be recorded ; but the surgeons of the transport are wholly occupied in despatching their living charge to the hospital ; and the surgeons there have enough to do in receiving them . Attempts are made to obtain the number and names and injuries of the new patients : there may or may not be a list furnished from the ship ; and the hospital surgeons inquire from bed to bed : but in such a scene mistakes are sure to arise ; and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less variation between the numbers recorded as received or dead and the proper number . No one could wonder at this who had for a moment looked upon the scene . The poor fellows just arrived had perhaps not had their clothes off since they were wounded or were seized with cholera , and they were steeped in blood and filth , and swarming with vermin . To obtain shirts and towels was hard work , because it had to be proved that they brought none with them . They were laid on the floor in the corridors , as close as they could be packed , thus breathing and contaminating the air which was to have refreshed the wards within . If laid upon so-called sheets , they entreated that the sheets might be taken away ; for they were of coarse canvas , intolerable to the skin . Before the miserable company could be fed , made clean , and treated by the surgeons , many were dead ; and a too large proportion were never to leave the place more , though struggling for a time with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nightingale refused to despair of five men so desperately wounded as to be set aside by the surgeons . The surgeons were right . As they said , their time was but too little for the cases which were not hopeless . And Florence Nightingale was right in finding time , if she could , to see whether there was really no chance . She ascertamed that these five were absolutely given over ; and she and her assistants managed to attend to them through the night . She cleaned and comforted them , and had spoonfuls of nourishment ready whenever they could be swallowed . By the morning round of the surgeons , these men were ready to be operated upon ; and they were all saved . It would have been easier work at a later period . Before many months were over , the place was ready for any number to be received in peace and quietness . Instead of being carried from one place to another , because too many had been sent to one hospital and too few to another , the poor fellows were borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their beds . They were found eager for cleanliness ; and presently they were clean accordingly , and lying on a good bed , between clean , soft sheets . They did not come in scorbutic , like their predecessors ; and they had no reason to dread hospital gangrene or fever . Every floor and every pane in the windows was clean ; and the air came in pure from the wide , empty corridors . There was a change of linen whenever it was desired ; and the shirts came back from the wash perfectly sweet and fresh . The cleaning of the wards was done in the mornings , punctually , quickly , quietly , and thoroughly . The doctors came round , attended by a nurse who received the orders , and was afterwards steady in the fulfilment of them . The tables of the medicines of the day were hung up in the ward ; and the nurse went round to administer them with her own hand . Where she was , there was order and quietness all day , and the orderlies were worth twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were better ; and they gave their minds more to their business . The nurse found time to suit each patient who wished it with a book or a newspaper , when gifts of that sort // arrived from England . Kind visitors sat by the beds to write letters for the patients , undertaking to see the epistles forwarded to England . When the invalids became able to rise for dinner , it was a turningpoint in their case ; and they were soo*i getting into the apartment where there were games and books and meetings of old comrades . As I have said before , those who died at these hospitals were finally scarcely more than those who died in-not the hospitals  --  but the barracks of the Guards at home . What were the changes in organization needed to produce such a regeneration as this ? They were such as must appear to Americans very simple and easy . The wonder will be rather that they were necessary at last than that they should have been effected with any difficulty . But Americans have never known what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent national institution ; and they can therefore hardly conceive of the strength of the classspirit which grows up in the various departments of the military organization . This jealousy , egotism , and stiffness of prejudice were much aggravated by the long peace , in which a great rusting of the apparatus of the system took place , without at all impairing the complacency of those who formed a part of it . The old medical officers were incapable , pedantic , and jealous ; and no proper relation had ever been established between them and the military authorities . The imbecility of the system cost the lives of others than the soldiers who died in hospital . Brave men arose , as in all such crises , to bear the consequences of other men 's mistakes , and the burden of exposing them ; and several physicians and surgeons died , far from home , in the effort to ameliorate a system which they found unworkable . The greatest benefactor in exhibiting evils and suggesting remedies , Dr. Alexander , lived to return home , and instigate reforms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he soon sank under the consequences of his labors . So did Lord Herbert , the Secretary of War , to whom , in conjunction with Miss Nightingale , the British army , at home , in India , and everywhere , owes its redemption from special sickness and undue mortality . In America the advantages may be enjoyed without tax or drawback . The citizens are accustomed to organize themselves for action of all sorts ; and no stiff-necked classes stand in the way of good management . The difficulty in America must rather be to understand how anything so perverse as the management of British military hospitals ten years ago can have existed to so late a date . It was supposed , ten years since , that there must be nine separate departments in every Military General Hospital , and the officials bore titles accordingly ; but there was such an odd confusion in their functions that every one of the nine was often seen doing the business of some other . The medical officers were drawing corks and tasting wines and inspecting provisions , when they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldiers ' money , and noting its amount , when he should have been marketing , or ordering the giving out of the provisions for the day . The paymaster could scarcely find time to discharge the bills , so much was his day filled up with doing eternal sums about the stoppages in the pay of the patients . There were thirteen kinds of stoppages in the army , three of which were for the sick in hospital : the paymaster could never be quite certain that he bad reckoned rightly with every man to the last penny ; the men were never satisfied ; and the confusion was endless . The commissariat , the purveyor , and the paymaster were all kept waiting to get their books made up , while soldiers were working the sums , - being called from their proper business to help about the daily task of the stoppages . Why there should not be one uniform stoppage out of the pay of men in hospital no person of modern ideas could see ; and the paymaster 's toils would have been lessened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deduction from // the patients ' pay at threepence or fourpence each , all round , instead of having to deal with thousands per day individually , under three kinds of charge upon the pay . The commandant 's post was the hardest , - he being supposed to control every province , and have every official under his orders , and yet being powerless in regard to two or three departments , the business of which he did not understand . The officers of those departments went each his own way ; and all unity of action in the establishment was lost . This is enough to say of the old methods . In the place of them , a far simpler system was proposed at the end of the war . The eternal dispute as to whether the commandant should be military or medical , a soldier or a civilian , was set aside by the decision that he should be simply the ablest administrator that could be found , and be called the Governor , to avoid the military title . Why there should be any military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not as soldiers , it is difficult to see ; and when the patients are about to leave the hospital , a stated supervision from the adjutant-*eneral 's department is all that can be required . Thus is all the jealousy between military and medical authority got rid of . The Governor 's authority must be supreme , like that of the commandant of a fortress , or the commander of a ship . He will not want to meddle in the doctors ' professional business ; and in all else he is to be paramount , - being himself responsible to the War-Office . The office , as thus declared , is equivalent to three of the nine old ones , namely , the Commandant , the Adjutant-General , and the Quartermaster-General . Next to the Governor , the Chief Medical Officer must be the most important man in the establishment . He is to be concerned with professional business only , and to see that all under him are to be devoted in the same way . For this purpose there must be an end to the system of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders from the Governor alone , and administering a simple and liberal system of diets and appliances of all sorts . It is his business to provide everything for the consumption of the establishment , and to keep the contractors up to their duty . The Treasurer 's function speaks for itself . All the accounts and payments under the Governor 's warrant are in his charge . There is one more office , rendered nccessary by the various and active service always going on , - the superintendent of that service , or Captain of the Wards . He is to have the oversight of the orderlies , cooks , washers , and storekeepers ; he is to keep order throughout the house ; and he is to be referred to in regard to everything that is wanted in the wards , except what belongs to the department of the medical officers or the steward . As for the medical department , there is now a training provided for such soldiers as wish to qualify themselves for hospital duty . Formerly , the hospital was served by such men as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and they naturally did not send the best . These men knew nothing of either cleaning wards or nursing patients . Their awkwardness in sweeping and scouring and making beds was extreme ; and they were helpless in case of anything being wanted to a blister or a sore . One was found , one day , earnestly endeavoring to persuade his patient to eat his poultice . It is otherwise now . The women , where there are any , ought to have the entire charge of the sweeping and cleaning ,  --  the housemaid 's work of the wards ; and as to the rest , the men of the medical-staff corps have the means of learning how to dress a blister , and poultice a sore , and apply plasters , lint , and bandages , and administer medicine , and how to aid the sick in their ablutions , in getting their meals with the least fatigue , and so on . Of female nurses it is not necessary to say much in America , any more than in England or France . They are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in great military and // civil hospitals they are a priceless treasure . The questions in regard to them are two . Shall their office be confined to the care of the linen and stores , and the supplying of extra diets and comforts ? If admitted to officiate in the wards , how far shall that function extend ? In England , there seems to be a strong persuasion that some time must elapse , and perhaps a generation of doctors must pass away , before the ministration of female nurses in military hospitals can become a custom , or even an unquestioned good . No rational person can doubt what a blessing it would be to the patients to have such nurses administer nourishment , when the rough orderlies would not have discernment or patience to give the frequent spoonful when the very life may hang upon it . Nobody doubts that wounds would be cleansed which otherwise go uncleansed , - that much irritation and suffering would be relieved which there are otherwise no hands to undertake . Nobody doubts that many lives would be saved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flickerings of struggling vitality were put under the charge of the nurses whom Nature made . But the difficulties and risks are great . On the whole , it seems to be concluded by those who know best , that only a few female nurses should be admitted into military and naval hospitals : that they should be women of mature age and ascertained good sense , thoroughly trained to their business : that they should be the women who have been , or who would be , the head nurses in other hospitals , and that they should be paid on that scale : that they should have no responsibility , - being wholly subject to the surgeons in ward affairs , and to their own superintendent in all others : that no enthusiasts or religious devotees should be admitted , - because that very qualification shows that they do not understand the business of nursincr : that everything that can be as well done by men should be done by trained orderlies : that convalescents should , generally speaking , be attended on by men , - and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a hundred or so in her charge , whereas of the graver cases forty or fifty are as many as one nurse can manage , with any amount of help from orderlies . These proposals give some idea of what is contemplated with regard to the ordinary nurses in a General Military Hospital . The superintendent of the nurses in each institution must be a woman of high quality and large experience . And she will show her good sense , in the first place , by insisting on a precise definition of her province , that there may be no avoidable ill-will on the part of the medical officers , and no cause of contention with the captain of service , or whatever the administrator of the interior may be called . She must have a decisive voice in the choice of her nurses ; and she will choose them for their qualifications as nurses only , after being satisfied as to their character , health , and temper . No good nurse can endure any fuss about her work and her merits . Enthusiasts and devotees find immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  or , as we may now say , they would find this , if they were ever to enter a hospital : for , in fact , they never now arrive there . The preparation brings them to a knowledge of themselves ; and the two sorts of women who really and permanently become nurses are those who desire to make a living by a useful and valued and well-paid occupation , and those who benevolently desire to save life and mitigate suffering , with such a temper of sobriety and moderation as causes them to endure hardship and ill-usage with firmness , and to dislike praise and celebrity at least as much as hostility and evil construction . The best nurses are foremost in perceiving the absurdity and disagreeableness of such heroines of romance as flourished in the press seven years ago , - young ladies disappointed in love , who went out to the East , found their lovers in hospital , and went off with them , to be happy ever after , without any // anxiety or shame at deserting their patients in the wards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence Nightingale , whose practical hard work , personal reserve , and singular administrative power have placed her as high above impeachment for feminine weaknesses as above the ridicule which commonly attends the striking out of a new course by man or woman . Those who most honor her , and most desire to follow her example , are those who most steadily bring their understandings and their hearts to bear upon the work which she began . Her ill-health has withdrawn her from active nursing and administration ; but she has probably done more towards the saving of life by working in connection with the War-Office in private than by her best-known deeds in her days of health . Through her , mainly , it is that every nation has already studied with some success the all-important subject of Health in the Camp and in the Hospital . It now lies in the way of American women to take up the office , and , we may trust , to " better the instruction . "               @ @ @ @ @ @
