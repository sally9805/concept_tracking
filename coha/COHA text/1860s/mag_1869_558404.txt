1869 . Financial Condition of the United States . ART . V. - THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE UNITED STATES . THE Southern threat of secession , in 1860 , found the people of the United States actively engaged in peaceful pursuits , without a thought of strife , and so little prepared for war that unprejudiced spectators could seriously expect to see the whole North overrun by the united and better drilled array of Southern chivalry . The outbreak was so sudden that it was long before all hopes of speedy reconciliation were abandoned . But , that delusion once shaken off , this peaceful people armed itself for the terrible struggle , and suddenly stepped forth , to the startled gaze of all Christendom , the greatest military power of modern times . A million of men , rushing to arms as by one impulse , might well astonish the slow-moving peoples of older countries . But astonishment soon yielded to a sense of mingled fear and dislike , which , in its turn , was speedily followed by the hope and the prediction that so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhaustion , and that the nation must succumb to financial disorder and ultimate bankruptcy . While such were the loud-spoken hopes of our enemies and the whispered fears of our friends , in the midst of discouragements and reverses and disasters , this scattered peopl.e of farmers and traders suddenly improvised a system of finance as gigantic as its armies , - a system which , during the whole period of the war , never failed or faltered , but fed the national treasury with a perennial supply , and which furnished during the four years from 1861 to 1865 , from domestic sources alone , a sum of money far exceeding any amount ever furnished by the same number of people for any purpose whatsoever . The sudden rise of the military and financial power of the United States will stand out in history as one of the most remarkable phenomena of the nineteenth century . Of the military power of the United States the outward evidence has , for a time at least , disappeared . The Union armies have been disbanded . Peace has restored the survivors to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the anvil . Like a vision the army arose , like a vision it has faded from sight // leaving no mark , . save in history and in the nation 's exultant consciousness of latent strength . The financial power of the United States has undergone no visible change . Money still flows into the nation 's coffers in the full measure of her needs ; and her needs are still gigantic . For peace , while disbanding her armies , has not yet paid her national debt . Unlike the army , the debt is not a positive creation . It is simply the evidence of a gigantic destruction . The army , created in a day , in a day could be disbanded . The destruction of years , represented by the debt , can be repaired only by years upon years of production and economy . This national debt is the one great intractable result of our Secession War . It is the one great novel element in our national life . Like a new atmosphere , as we shall try to show , it changes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . Its influence for final good and evil is still hidden ; but the magnitude of that influence impresses itself upon us readily , when we notice the extent to which every question of national policy or social progress depends for its solution upon its relation to our national finances . All thinking men are agreed that the questions which will most prominently and most profitably occupy the minds of political thinkers during the next decade are the financial questions . The importance to which these questions have risen is due solely to the existence of our national debt . No solution to these questions can be found without first clearly comprehending the origin , nature , and influence of the national debt itself . The total government expenditures since the beginning of 1861 - deducting a comparatively unimportant annual sum for - the ordinary expenses of civil administration - represent the cost to the nation of the Secession War . This sum , amounting in round numbers to five thousand millions of dollars , was raised partly from taxes and partly from loans . The national debt represents only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the war includes not only the present national debt , but also nearly the whole of the taxes raised since 1861 , amounting together , as we have loosely stated it , to five thousand millions of dollars . This sum has been contributed by the people to its government for the purposes of war . What has // the government done with it ? It has expended it in paying for the labor of hundreds of thousands of men , whose labor has added nothing to the wealth of the country , has not merely been totally unproductive , but has been specifically devoted to the work of destruction . It has expended it in the purchase of food and clothing for these non-producing men , - in the purchase of arms , which are their destrnctive tools , and which have no value except as such , and of the ammunition which they have consumed , in payment of their transportation from place to place . It has expended it in the purchase of thousands upon thousands of horses and mules , taken , like the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and which , like the men , have been killed or maimed by wounds , or worn out by fatigue . It has expended it in the construction of immense war vessels , which not only do not produce anything themselves , but require the continuous withdrawal of labor from production in order to keep them in repair , and many of which were entirely destroyed by the enemy or wrecked at sea . Examine closely into the course of gover.nment expenditure in whatever direction , we find that every dollar spent by the government for war purposes is spent in the payment of unproductive labor and for the purchase of articles which have been destroyed . In other words , every dollar spent by the government on war is economically a total loss to the nation . Before pointing out in what manner this fact affects the nature of the national debt , it is necessary to state and answer the objection , that all this money was , in our case , spent at home , - that whatever the government purchased was purchased of its own citizens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - that production was stimulated thereby , - that business became active , prosperity became general , and wealth increased rapidly . Even granting , what we propose farther on to deny , that prosperity became general , and that wealth increased rapidly , it must be evident , after a moment 's reflection , that the nation as a whole can not have increased in wealth b*y means of profits on articles destroyed ; for the profit on any article can bear only a small proportion to its total cost , and if the whole is destroyed , the nation as a body loses the whole cost , while // the producer , as a part of the nation , gains only the small profit . For example , if a gunpowder manufacturer produces one hundred thousand dollars ' worth of gunpowder a year , and his brother , a builder , in the same time erects ten houses worth one hundred thousand dollars , and the profit on the two is equal , then in either case the nation is equally enriched to the extent of that profit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been enriched through the manufacturer 's labor to the extent of his profit only , while it is impoverished to the extent of his total product . In the other case the nation has been enriched to the same extent by the builder 's profit , while his entire product , the houses , remains also , and of itself adds yearly to the profits and consequent wealth of the nation . It can not need further argument to prove that the objection cited is entirely unfounded , and can not invalidate or materially qualify the assertion that every dollar spent by the government on war is a total loss to the nation . The question immediately arises : Is it , then , certain that we have become poorer by the war ? It must be evident that we have become poorer , unless we have in other ways added to our wealth more than we have destroyed . We can have added to our wealth only by increased production or diminished consumption , - that is , by increased individual economy . Production , undoubtedly , was exceedingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it is remembered that whole branches of industry lay idle and abandoned for years , in consequence of the war , and that every fifth or sixth man of our able-bodied population was in the field , and hence totally unproductive , - when it is remembered , too , what crowds of men were drawn by the war from pursuits of active production , and turned into unnecessary traders and speculators , army hangers-on , office-holders , and practical idlers of all degrees , and how , in these and in many other ways , a very large proportion of the total producing power of the country ran to waste , it is not safe to assume that the increased activity of those who continued to produce could do more than make up for the lost labor of those who were idle . Indeed , it can be shown that in the leading branches of our national activity production very materially declined ; but the published // data are so incomplete , and hence so open to cavil , that we prefer to rest the assertion on probabilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , it can not be reasonably assumed that we have added to our wealth by increased production , have we added to it by increased individual economy ? The whole nation would answer , No ! If there is any one subject upon which all men this day agree , it is that the extravagance , the waste , the reckless profusion of individual expenditure during our years of war , has never been surpassed or equalled . It is a fact too universally recognized to admit of doubt . In place of increased individual economy , we have only increased individual extravagance ; far from diminishing general consumption , we have only increased waste and destruction . Now , if only greater individual production or lessened individual consumption can have prevented the nation from becoming impoverished by the government expenditure in war , and we find that production has not increased nor consumption declined , we must accept as established the conclusion before arrived at , - that the nation is impoverished to the extent of the government war expenditures . There is a qualification , however , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , for many years before the war , been progressing in wealth very rapidly , making large annual savings , and accumulating capital in an ever-increasing ratio . I5Ias our war expenditure , it may be asked , done more than destroy the annual savings during the time of its continuance , - thus only staying the increase of our wealth , without impairing our capital ? Our Census Reports show that the increase in wealth of our people between 1850 and 1860 amounted annually to about four hundred and fifty millions of dollars . Supposing that the increase in the earlier years of the decade was less than the average , and in the later years higher than the average , we obtain a fair estimate of five hundred millions of dollars as the annual increase in the years immediately preceding the war . This includes the whole country , South as well as North . Our estimate of the cost of the war refers to the expenses of the North only . Yet even this far exceeds the former annual savings . The cost of the war to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its war expenses are added to those of the North , the amount will be so large that it can not possibly be gainsaid that the war expenditure of the country far exceeded its former annual savings , or any increased savings that it might have made during the same period of peace , - and that the country not only did not increase , but actually decreased in wealth in consequence of the war , and during its whole continuance . How is it possible that a nation can go on impoverishing itself without discovering it ? How even is it possible that we are poorer after years of great business activity , of unexampled regularity in the employment of all classes of labor at high wages , after years of unvarying general prosperity ? Whence this immense development in our national progress , this building of railroads and telegraphs by the thousand miles , this opening up of new territory in every direction , this vast increase in mines , and mills , and factories , and banks , and storehouses , and bridges , and canals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our wealth is really less ? In this country , where production has heretofore been highly profitable , and where , heretofore , habits of economy have more or less generally prevailed , it was estimated by statisticians that the whole people together saved every year about five per cent of their total productions . Living as Americans were in the habit of living in 1860 , and working as they then worked , they could , on an average , save five per cent of their total earnings . If they wanted to save more , they were obliged to live les* well , to spend less for their food , shelter , clothing , amusement , and the like . But if , in the fervor of patriotism , they had been willing to sacrifice their total annual savings , and devote them to the support of a great national war , they could have paid over to the government five per cent on all their earnings , and have still lived as well as before , and yet not have encroached upon their capital . If , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been known that it would for several years require an annual expenditure of a sum equal to the whole of the nation 's estimated annual surplus , if the people had been willing to raise that sum by submitting to taxation , and if taxation could by any means have been reduced to // the perfection of theory , then the government , by simply taking from each individual of the nation five per cent of his annual carnings , could have provided all necessary means for carrying on the war . At the end of the year , no one would have been either poorer or richer than at the end of the preceding year . Such it would seem , would , at first sight at least , have been the result . But in reality the result would have been different . The desire to accumulate is so strong in the hearts of men that the surrender to the government of the anticipated annual savings would have stimulated each individual still to procure for himself some little profit , some little saving , by increased labor or closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a certain limited extent , increased , and consumption diminished . Many individuals would still have made a saving . The nation at large would still have had a small surplus . The wealth of the country would still have increased . But it is evident that such foresight would be showji only when every one knew beforehand that his annual savings would be required of him . Unfortunately , few people anticipated the duration or the costliness of the war , while the very threat of disturbance had produced confusion in financial and commercial circles , and had seriously impaired the earnings of the people . Few thought they were able , still fewer were willing* to give their surplus to the support of the war . The idea of raising the necessary funds by taxation , if ever entertained , was quickly abandoned . The needs of the Treasury were too urgent to admit of delay . Borrowing was resorted to , and the national debt was created . We have just seen what would have been the roI*able effect upon the national wealth of raising the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raising it by loans is as follows . If the government had to take from the nation by loans a sum equal to the nation 's estimated annual surplus , and if loans could be raised with the same theoretical perfection supposed in the case of taxes , the government would then borrow from each individual the actual sum of his annual profit . For this loan the government would , of course , give to each individual a bond for the corresponding amount . This bond is property , // and , where the credit of the government is good , will be worth its face . The holder of this bond , who has lent his annual profit to the government , thus still possesses his annual profit , or at least its equivalent , in the shape of a merchantable security . He has made as large an annual profit as ever , and , although he has invested it in a loan to the government , he has in exchange a bond which is salable , and with which he can buy anything he may want just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his annual profits to the government , and yet has them in hand in a shape almost as good as ready cash . He feels that he has the same sum to invest in improving his property , in extending his business , in enlarging his expenditure , as if he had not loaned his profits to the government We have seen that whatever the government takes from the people for purposes of war is destroyed . If the amount is obtained by taxation , it is destroyed , and we are all poorer . If the amount is obtained by loans , it is still destroyed , and we are all poorer none the less . But if it is obtained by taxation , we all know that we are poorer to that extent . Whereas , if it is obtained by loans , we delude ourselves with the belief that we are as well off as ever . It is this delusion which is the cause of alt that is mysterious and inexplicable in our financial history of the last eight years . When we say that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we simply say that everything produced in the course of the year was consumed in the course of the year , excepting that small portion . Ninety-five per cent of the labor of the nation is required to feed , and clothe , and shelter , and warm , and instruct , and amuse the whole . Five per cent of the labor of the nation is devoted to the production of permanent and enduring property , such as houses , factories , railroads , or breeding-cattle and seed-coi*n , in which the annual savings of the whole nation find their investment . The products of all find buyers ; the largest proportion is bought for consumption , the smallest proportion for investment ; but for every one hundred dollars ' worth of property produced there are one hundred dollars ready to buy it . When the government takes five dollars from the people in the shape of taxes , // the people have only ninety-five dollars left wherewith to buy , and the government has the other five* and people and government have together one hundred dollars wherewith to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the government takes five dollars from the people in the shape of a loan , and gives a bond for it , the people still have one hundred dollars left wherewith to buy , and the government has five dollars besides ; and thus people and government together have one hundred and five dollars wherewith to buy one hundred dollars ' worth of products . The effect is magical . Without any cause that can be defined , the demand for almost every kind of product is suddenly increased . Not only are all ordinary buyers in the market the same as usual , but there is a new buyer iii the market , whose buying is extraordinary . 1-us wants are urgent , immediate , undisguised . Price with him is no object . His only consideration is quantity and speed . The whole people are in the markets with their usual demand . The supply is , at best , not more than sufficient for their wants . Yet for this supply they have to compete with the most powerful , the most urgent , the most reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence is evident , - a sudden , rapid , and continuous rise in the prices of all those things for which the government and the nation are direct competitors , and a slower and more gradual , but equally sure , rise in everything else , whether required by the government or not . Food , clothing , arms , and munitions of war are the first to rise ; next macbinery , metals , raw material of every kind ; then shipping , and other means of transportation , and all their representatives , like railroad stocks ; lastly , labor . In time and in degree there may be differences , but all things and all services alike advance in price , steadily , rapidly , irresistibly , under the influence of the mysterious demand arising from the persistent determination of people and government combined to invest one hundred and five dollars in one hundred dollars ' worth of products . Not only did such a rise as we have described apply to the products on hand at the time when the government first began its purchases , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which // in many cases the government contracted in advance but it affected more powerfully likewise that upon which every one 's production mainly depends , - his capital . The factory whose product , or the house whose rent , or the cow whose calf is suddenly doubled in value , are themselves suddenly doubled in value likewise . Thus this govevument competition increased largely the value of every one 's stock on hand , of every one 's future product , of every one 's entire capital ; and this extraordinary increase in value was everywhere , especially in the earlier years of the war , looked upon as the profit of the year , and hence individual prosperity throughout the land seemed unbounded ,  --  at first , incredible . But the pause of incredulity could not maintain itself against the tide of wealth that came rushing in resistlessly upon every one . All hesitancy was drowned in the nation 's exultation over its prosperity . The wisest wondered whether , after all , their wisdom had not been folly , - whether the immutable laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a miracle had not been permitted in favor of this chosen people . The experience of other nations is not applicable to us . " Who does not remember the cry ? The warnings from the press or rostrum were merely the hoarse croakings of weakkneed or disloyal theorists . There was the wealth , the indubitable prosperity , right around us . How could it be gainsaid ? But it was , nevertheless , a delusion , a hollow sham , a dream from which we have yet to awake . The greater this prosperity , the more money the people had to speud , aud the greater became the competition between the people and government for the limited and diminishing supply of products . The needs of the government were likewise constantly increasing , from the augmentation of its armies , and the wider area over which the war was carried on . The competition became excited . The advance in prices was fabulous . The increase of individual prosperity became intoxicating . An insane fever of extravagance spread through the land . No destruction was too reckless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diseased cravings of the whilom sober , thrifty citizens of an industrious republic . It was then that gold , which had disappeared from circulation , reappeared on harness and livery , and // in every ostentatious form ; that even Russian and English splendor paled before the extravagance of American " milords " upon the continent of Europe ; that four-in-hands came into use , and costly club-houses grew up like mushrooms ; and that America became the great buyer of all high-priced articles the world over , - drained all Christendom of its diamonds , drank more Champagne than ever grew on French soil , and ran its importation bills from three hundred up to four hundred and fifty millions per annum . If what precedes is fairly correct , three important facts will become evident to every one : first , that an immense activity in rade during the war period , and a large advance in price of everything that could be bought or sold , can be explained by the debt alone , without reference to the currency ; secondly , that it is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and that the incurring of such a debt must inevitably produce that result ; thirdly , that it is the imperative duty of every good citizen to resist to the utmost all attempts to increase the debt , and to use every endeavor to reduce its amount as rapidly as possible . We have shown that the property taken from the people by the government for war purposes is utterly destroyed , and that the people are impoverished thereby ; that the taking of property from the people in the shape of loans not only prevents them from discovering their loss , but actually deludes them with the belief that their wealth is increased , thus leading to reckless waste at the very moment when the most scrupulous economy is absolutely essential to national well-being . We now propose to show how the real or imaginary advantages derived from the creation of the debt have mainly redounded to the benefit of the few , while its disadvantages have fallen upon the many . Our object is not to urge the wisdom or the folly , the equity or the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to explain existing facts by tracing them to their origin . The first and immediate effect of competition between government and individual for existing products was , as we have seen , to cause an advance in their price . The great bulk of all products must at all times be in the hands of the wealthy classes , as distinguished from the laboring classes . An advance // in the price of products already on hand benefits , not the laborer who produced them , but only the capitalist who owns them . It actually injures the laborer ; since out of low wages , proportioned to the original low cost of production , he has to buy his share of the products at the advanced price . In this way profits from the first advance in price came out of the pockets of the laboring classes , and went into the pockets of the capitalists . Nor was this all . For the possessor of capital is , in nine cases out of ten , also the possessor of intelligence , especially in relation to business matters , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued advance in prices , and hence , far from selling at the first rise , held back their products , contracted in advance for the labor and production of the less intelligent , and thus derived the advantage , not only of the natural advance , but of the entire speculative advance also . Next to the advance in the value of existing products came the advance in the value of capital itself in every form . Houses , factories , ships , railroads , machinery , money , credit , all advanced in value , and the advance went to the owner , justly and rightfully enough , but still to the disadvantage of the tenant paying rent , - of the workman , who received a less proportion of the value of goods manufactured , owing to increased interest on higher valuation of the factory and its machinery , - of travellers , senders of freight , and consumers of all goods transported , - and , lastly , of all borrowers and users of credit . The value of labor , it is true , gradually increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The first threat of disturbance at the South had caused an extraordinary depression in business . In many branches labor was almost entirely idle during the winter of ' 1860 - 61 . Wages were very much depressed , and there was much suffering . The improved demand for labor was met with great alacrity at low rates , and it was only very slowly that workingmen felt and understood the increased cost of living , and demanded and received higher wages . But wages have never since advanced in proportion to the advance in the cost of living . Special Commissioner Wells , in his recent admirable report to the Secretary of the Treasury , // shows , that , whereas the average wages of laboring men in the various manufacturing establishments in the United States have increased only fifty-eight per cent , their average expenditures for a similar style of living have increased seventy-three per cent . In other words , the value of products has increased seventythree per cent , but the value of the labor producing them has increased only fifty-eight per cent , - showing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formerly , and labor a si*aller proportion . It is not alone by its effect on prices and wages that the creation of the debt has benefited capital and injured labor . The creation itself has been a direct and immediate advantage to capital , in which labor could not possibly share . Without the concentration , the activity , the intelligence of capital , the debt itself would have been an impossibility . Hundreds , nay , thousands , of firms suddenly sprang up all over the country , whose principal , if not whose sole business , was to dispose of government securities . To the skill , the energy , the enterprise of these firms , some of whom will live in history from their association with the finances of the country , the people were at times more deeply indebted than is generally known . Some colossal , many moderate fortunes , attest the profitableness of their labors ; nor has their reward been undeserved . But the capital which they used was capital which otherwise would have been productively employed . Its use for the purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital employed in production . The total profits are only an increase of the burden of the debt . They are not like the profits of labor , a profit on production , a product saved ; they are emphatically a profit on destruction , and only add to the general increase of prices , from which , as above shown , capital profits , while labor suffers . The national debt has proved an exceedingly safe , profitable , and convenient investment for idle capital all over the country . it has paid the owners , on an average , nine per cent annual interest on their original investment , and has furnished capital with an opportunity for employment without sharing any part of the expense attending its management . The tax-payer is taxed to pay not only the interest on the bond , but the // expense and risk of collecting and distribnting it . The saying attribnted to Mr. Astor , that he is only the managing steward of his own estate , snggests the labor , thought , anxiety , and risk from which the capitalist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The expense necessary thus to relieve him is borne , not by himself , but by the whole people , who are thus really taxed to pay for the management of rich men 's accumnlatioiis . There is no injnstice , no wrong in this it is a part of the indncement held out to the capit*st to lend his money to the government ; but it is one of the many ways in which the creation of the national debt has tended and still tends to benefit capital at the expense of labor . Less directly due to the national debf , but arising ont of the same circumstances , is the enormous advantage accruing to capital from the national banking system . Through this system the capital invested in a national bank receives actually a double rate of interest at the expense of the general public , - eight per cent average interest on the bonds deposited in the Treasnry , and six or seven per cent besides on a similar amount of currency issued . The injury thereby done to labor is not found alone in the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest ; but it consists also , and even more largely , in this other fact , - tha ? the large profit made by a certain amount of capital invested in national banks tends to make all other capital more valuable , tends constantly to give to capital a larger share of the profit on production , and thus to leave a smaller share of profit to labor . In all these various ways , - by the advance in value of all products in the possession of capitalists , and the increased cost of all articles consumed by labor , - by the increased value of capital itself , and the consequently decreased share of profit on production accruing to labor , - by the rapid increase in the cost of products , and the slow increase in the wages of labor , creating a disadvantage still existing against the latter , - by the profits accruing to capital from the negotiation of the various issues of national debt , all of which profits are paid out of taxes levied upon the whole people , - by the advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being administered for the owner at the public expense , - by the ex // traordinary profits realized to capital through investment in the national banks , all of which are paid by the people at large , - in all these various ways , and in numerous other ways besides , the creation and existence of the national debt has constantly tended to give an increased share of all products to capital , and a diminished share of all products to labor . If we now resume the argument with which we started , we shall arrive at what we must consider a sound view of the financial *ndition of the country as affected by our late civil war and our national debt . The total property of the people of the United States was by the census of 1860 valued at sixteen thousand millions of dollars , and was increasing at the rate of about five hundred millions of dollars per annum . If production and consumption both continued unaffected , the same proportionate rate of increase could have been fairly anticipated . It is more than probable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption , by the people alone , increased , and that , therefore , the same proportionate rate of increase has not been maintained . But , waiving this consideration , which is not susceptible of positive proof or disproof , and conceding that the proportionate rate of increase would otherwise have continued unchanged , it is certain , beyond contradiction , that , during the period named , the additional consumption or destruction by the government for war purposes far exceeded the increase of former years , and that , therefore , the property of the whole country must have been less in 1865 than in 1860 . The effect of obtaining by loans the money needed for the war expenditures of the government has been to place a larger share of the property of the country in the hands of the wealthy , and to leave a smaller share in the hands of the laboring classes . The total property of the country is less , and of the diminished property more is held by the wealthy , and less by the poor . The latter part of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , is entirely borne out by the general belief . In so grave a state paper as Mr. Wells 's Report , already referred to , we find the emphasized statement : The rich become richer , and the poor poorer . This statement seems to have met with that general acceptance accorded only // to the happy expression of a recognized fact . It has never , to our knowledge , been seriously questioned . It has been reproduced , day by day , both as argument and illustration , in the ablest public journals of the country , and is certainly entitled to be considered as a fact . It is true that Mr. Wells adduces it only as proof of the evil effects of an inconvertible paper currency ; but this in no wise alters its force . The whole country admits that the poor are poorer . But additional evidence of the fact can easily be obtained by any one desirous of further proof . One need only inquire of the laboring men with whom he comes in casual contact , and he will ascertain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The renewal of strikes in various branches of trade - which are more likely to increase than to diminish - confirms this view . But there is one instructive proof , not often enough considered , - the rapid development of pauperism and crime . The records of charitable societies , and of the police courts , show an increase beyond belief . Crimes against the person are those which most attract public attend tion by the violence attending them . These are not , as a general rule , directly inspired by want . Hence the connection between want and crime is not readily apparent to unreflecting readers . It does exist even in cases of violence ; but crimes against property are largely traceable to want , and they are the great majority of all crimes . Not that the honest mechanic , or the modest sewing-girl , or the faithful messengerboy will , on the first approach of poverty , suddenly change into a burglar , a wanton , or a thief ; but there are many halfidling mechanics , and flirting seamstresses , aild tricky errandboys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept moderately honest by moderate prosperity . It is these that recruit the ranks of crime and vice under the temptation of poverty . Certainly , never in the history of the country have the representatives of crime and vice been increasing so rapidly as now : painful evidence of declining prosperity among our laboring classes . Against the truth of the statement that the poor are poorer , it is only asserted that the deposits in savings-banks continue to increase . The assertion is not conclusive . In the first // place , the number of depositors is very small indeed , compared to the total laboring population ; so that certain classes , like house servants , directly dependent upon the wealthy , might still be prosperous while others suffered . Again , many deposit in savings-banks only while accumulatiug savings to be subsequently employed in their business ; the failure to draw and use this money is often a positive evidence that a declining business affords no employment for it . Once more , it is notorious that the cheap administration of savings-banks , which are managed like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great inducement to people of even considerable means to deposit their funds with them . The sums to be accepted from individuals are limited , and the number of accounts that reach that limit is constantly increasing . For all these reasons , no great weight is to be attached to the argument drawn from increasing deposits in savings banks ; and as this is the only evidence known to us in opposition to all other facts , we must accept the harmony we have found to exist between facts , probabilities , and general belief , as conclusive on the point , that the poor are poorer . That the rich are richer no one seems to deny . The colossal fortunes accumulated during the last ten years , not here and there only , but in almost every State and every city , - the extraordinary number of people , throughout the length and breadth of the land , who live in new and expensive dwellings , who support carriages and livery servants , who buy costly paintings and diamonds and plate , who own large amounts of goveminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks of real estate , - these go to prove that the number of rich people has very much increased . We thus find that the latter part of our conclusion - namely , that more property is held by the wealthy and less by the poor - is easily reconcilable with facts , and is indeed generally accepted . It is to the first part of our conclusion - namely , that the total property of the country is less - that exception is most likely to be taken . All will admit that the rich are richer , and the poor poorer . The doubtful question is , Are the rich enriched to the extent of the total loss of the poor ? or is the total property of the country really less ? // Not until the next census is taken will it be possible to answer this question in a manner at all authoritative . There are , however , some facts of great weight which can be adduced in support of the conclusion arrived at by reasoning alone . The separate States of the Union publish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon which the State taxes are levied . Tax returns are proverbially untrustworthy ; but the untrustworthiness will be about the same in one year as in another , so that for the purposes of comparison among themselves they may be accepted as correct . The year 1866 is the last of which we have moderately complete returns . These show , that , out of twenty-one States , only two can boast of an even nominal increase in the property valuation per head of their inhabitants ; the great agricultural States of the Northwest , unscathed by actual war , all show a decline in property valuation , while th' decline in the Southern States , for four years swept by fire and sword , is immense . Of all the States of which the data are accessible , only one - Minnesota - shows at the same time an increase of average wealth and a diminution of State debt . Minnesota 's average wealth has increased from $207 to $ 229 , and its State debt decreased from $15 to $10 per head . The increase of average wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the State debt shows an almost equal increase from $ 88 to $135 . Iowa , Michigan , and Wisconsin all show a moderate , but decided , decrease in wealth , and increase in State debt . Illinois , the most prosperous and progressive of the Western States , shows a decline in wealth from . $ 214 to $183 , and a slight decrease in debt . The four last-named States , far removed from the theatre of war , producing mainly articles the value of which has largely increased during the last six years , have yet undergone a process of impoverishment which has reduced the average wealth of each individual of their total population , in spite of inflation and high prices , from $285 in coin , in 1860 , to $259 in currency , in 1866 , and increased the average burden of State indebtedness for each individual from three dollars to four . The relative correctness of these valuations is indorsed in various instances by actual count of the property itself . Commercial statistics , the reports of the Agricultural Bureau at // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the number of our two most valuable domestic animals , the cow and the horse , has not increased in proportion to population in the Eastern and Northwestern States , and has largely 4ecreased in the Border and Southern States . Our cotton and tobacco crops have been much smaller than formerly ; and our great breadstuff crops have not , until within the last two years , been anything like an average . Our shipping , before the war the greatest commercial marine of the world , has been driven from the ocean ; many of the vessels were destroyed , and others sold to foreigners , and the proceeds invested in government bonds . With facts like these before us , where are we to look for the evidences of increased wealth ? There are undoubtedly ostensible evidences in abundance , otherwise the belief in our prosperity would be impossible . But it will appear that these evidences are deceptive . There is an immense increase in the production of copper , and iron , and coal , and a corresponding , or even larger , increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coal mines , and of the various costly establishments in which these products are manufactured into articles of use . It may seem preposterous , but it is nevertheless true , that , far from enriching the country , these industries are actually impoverishing it ; that the country is poorer through almost every ton of iron or copper which it produces . The enormous increase in the iron and copper production has become possible only by means of heavy protective tariffs . The effect of these tariffs is to tax heavily every consumer of iron , or of anything made by the aid of iron , in order to pay back to the iron-manufacturer the money which he loses on his manufacture . The extreme protectionists do not claim that iron can be made here in the quantities and qualities in which it is now made , except at a loss . It is on this very ground that they claim protection . Iron , nevertheless , continues to be made , and the loss continues to be incurred . Only the manufacturers have succeeded in persuading Congress to tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss they make , and a handsome profit besides . The manufacture goes on at a loss ; the manufacturer makes a profit . Both this loss and profit are a loss to the // whole country . The iron interests have of late been extraordinarily prosperous . Over five thousand miles of railway , to be built this year , are projected ; and the supplying of those now in progress with rails , and spikes , and car-wheels , and axles , and locomotives , and other iron-work , kee* the mines , and furnaces , and rolling-mills , and machine-shops , and coalmines , and coal-trains , all in full occupation , while the supplyis scarcely equal to the demand . In 1837 it was demonstrated that there was not iron enough in the country to supply the demand for three months , and before the three months were out , iron could hardly be given away , and almost every dealer and manufacturer was bankrupt . What would become of the hundreds of millions of wealth now represented by the iron and coal interests , if returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles in the revision of our tariW or if , from some of the causes about to be referred to , any stoppage should come to the enormous railroad extension now going on ? liundreds of millions of what is called wealth - in reality , nothing but a capitalized annual tax upon a deluded people - would be swept out of existence the moment the truth of free trade principles came to be recognized . Can enormous establishments , no matter for what *purpose erected , ever be rightly called wealth , when the whole country has to be taxed for their maintenance ? Is the increase of such establishments an increase of wealth ? Is it not rather an increase of poverty ? Can any increase of them offset a decrease in the supply of bread and meat ? The writers on agricultural statistics , while admitting the diminished stock of horses and neat cattle , point with pride to the enormous increase in the number of sheep now in the country , and the corresponding increase in the annual production of wool , together with the large increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one time , very profitable . The sudden cutting off of the cotton supply , the necessary substitution of wool in many articles of apparel , not only with us , but all the world over , and the extraordinary demand for coarse woollen cloths and blankets for army use , created and maintained a demand for wool , which the whole world could not supply without an advance in price . At this // advance it was possible in the Northwestern States to prodnce wool at a profit , and the raising of sheep was begun with an energy , activity , and intelligence that only our people are capable of . The number of sheep in the country has probably trebled since 1860 . The capital invested in woollen manufactures has probably quadrupled . This array of rapidly increased wealth is imposing . But what is the truth ? *s soon as other wool-producing countries experienced the increased demand arising from our war and the absence of cotton , they , like ourselves , increased their production , and , being more favorably situated for raising wool than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , and were soon able again to undersell us . Then , of course , our wool-growers and wool-spinners appealed to Congress for protection ; and in order to protect them from losing the money which must inevitably be lost by somebody through the carrying on of an unprofitable industry , Congress agreed to tax the whole people sufficiently to make up the loss to the wool-men , and pay them a profit besides . Even under this unjust procedure , the wool-men are not prosperous . South America , the Cape , and Australia , all over-producing under the stimulus of the excited demand of 1862 - 64 , can still undersell us , and German and Belgian weavers can still export to us their cloths and make a profit , while our manufactures languish . Can we call this an increase of wealth ? Can we offset against our diminished cotton crops the unprofitable woollen-mills , that run only by levying an unjust tax upon the people ? Can the sheep , browsing at the nation 's expense on the pastures of Michigan , compensate us for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The large increase in the railroads of the country is put forward as another evidence of increased wealth . It is true that there is no better addition to national wealth than that of a well-constructed railway , which pays a reasonable dividend on its cost . But of how large a proportion of the nine thousand miles added to our railway system between 1861 and 1867 can this be said ? How many of them will pay expenses ? How many of them were built to supply a legitimate want ? How many of the 36,000 miles in operation at the // close of 1867 had ever paid regular dividends ? Why , it is notorious that the great bulk of the roads in the United States never did , and never will , pay expenses . They are unquestionably an aid , a highly valuable accessory , to the production and distribution of wealth ; but in estimating value , the advantages derived from the road are already included in the increased value of all property near it , and thus , unless a road actually pays expenses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unfortunately , most of the roads recently built never did and never will pay a dividend . Many of them never were intended to do this ; were , on the contrary , started mainly with a view to enrich their builders and designers at the expense of a confiding public . We have examined at as great length as our space will permit the leading evidences of increased national wealth , without finding any adequate offset to the indubitable evidences of decreased wealth before presented . We find our assertion , derived solely from the nature of the case , that the nation is poorer , confirmed , and , as we think , strongly confirmed , by the facts examined . It only remains for us to indicate more fully how the fact that we are poorer is compatible with the all but universal , all but invincible , belief in our increased wealth . In the beginning of this article we have explained the delusion resulting from government loans . Whatever the government takes from the people is destroyed . If it takes from each of us our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes , and destroys it , we know that we are to that extent poorer . If it takes our share of the expenses in the shape of a loan , the property taken is destroyed , and we are poorer just the same ; but as we get a bond in exchange for the money loaned , and as that bond is property , it becomes almost impossible to understand that we are not just as rich as before . But why is that bond considered property ? It can neither be eaten nor drunk , nor worn , nor used as an ornament , nor will it help to produce anything of the value of one single dollar . The only reason why it is considered property is because it pays interest . Now who pays this interest ? Of course , the people . If taxes are rightly levied , we all pay our share in proportion to // our means . If loans were divided up in the same way , we should all have loaned about the same amount that we should have been taxed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levy the interest on the debt , is it not evident that each of us will be taxed precisely the same amount that he receives back in interest ? If , in 1861 , the government had needed $100 from every citizen , and had taxed every one to that amount , every one would have been $ 100 poorer ; but that would have ended the matter . But if the government had borrowed $ 100 from every citizen , every one would still have been $100 poorer ; only he would have held a government bond for that amount , which would produce him $6 interest per annum . But before the government could pay him that interest , it would have to raise it by taxation , and the expense of raising it , with all the wasteful machinery of administration and collection , with all the fraud and mismanagement , would swell the amount to be raised to $ 7 , at least . If taxes are rightly levied , every citizen will then have to pay $ 7 annual taxes towards the expenses of the debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 taxes , the gdvernment will pay him back $ 6 of it as interest on his bond . In other words , the citizen who pays $ 100 in taxes loses his money , and knows that the transaction is ended . The citizen who lends the government $ 100 loses his money likewise , but receives in exchange a bond , which entitles him to the privilege of receiving , to the end of time , $6 annual interest , on condition of paying $ 7 annual taxes . Of course , loans being voluntary , the amount loaned by individuals is as various as possible , and hence no one is in reality taxed $ 7 , in order to receive $ 6 , in interest . But the fact is , that for every $ 6 , paid for interest on a bond , somebody has to be taxed $ 7 , and that the bond has no value whatsoever , save and except as it entitles the holder to tax some one else for the annual interest . To the individual , this bond is good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property at all . Yet of this kind of property we to-day own over two thousand millions of dollars , and count it up complacently in estimating our wealth , and live accordingly . To this sum should be added a large , but indefinite , amount for increase of the debts of the separate States , the effect of which is precisely the // same as that of government debt , and the evidences of which are held as property in precisely the same way as national bonds . No portion of these debts is represented by any property now in existence . They are simply owed by the people of the United States and of the separate States . But when the people count up their wealth at the end of the year , do they deduct the amount of these debts from their total property ? Does each individual , in estimating his wealth , deduct his share of the national debt , or the debt of his State ? We have shown that the effect of a government loan is to advance the price of all products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices in precis*ly the same proportion that the amount borrowed bears to the nation 's annual product . If the nation 's annual product is 100 , and the government borrows 5 , prices of all products combined will advance just S per cent . There is speculation , and speculation in this case will tend to advance the price still higher . But leaving speculation aside , the advance of all products will be about equal to the amount borrowed by the government . The total amount borrowed by the government may be set down at three thousand millions of dollars , or twenty per cent of the total property valuation of the United States in 1860 . The whole of this property has advanced in price fully twenty per cent since then , without being worth one dollar more , since it does not raise more products of any kind than it did in 1860 . This fictitious advance in price , amounting to over three thousand millions of dollars , we are all counting as wealth , and living accordingly . We have thus already accounted for over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this people to-day believe themselves possessed of , but which are in no true sense of the word property , which add nothing whatever to our national wealth . To these should be added the immense fictitious value given to coal-beds , and ironmines , and copper deposits , and rolling-mills , and woollen factories , and other property of various kinds , by tariff protection . The fabulous profits realized by some of these industries have trebled and quadrupled the nominal value of the capital invested in them , and this nominal value is to-day // taken by the owners , and by every one else , as the correct measure of their wealth . Precisely the same is the case with the millions of railroad stock issued during the last few years to represent " capitalized earnings , " and " improvements paid for out of traffic receipts , " and " losses or profits of the directors in stock speculation . " Some leading lines of railways have , no doubt , actually improved in value through increased traffic and better management ; but the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheer fabrications , representing nothing tangible , and , while adding large amounts to the nominal wealth of individuals , yet do not increase the real wealth of the country by one single dollar . It is impossible to tell , even approximately , the amount of this fictitious wealth , but with the figures already given it will not seem exaggerated to estimate it at over six thousand millions of dollars , or not far from one half of the total property valuation of the whole country in 1860 . The figures are not given for their own sake ; they are too much the result of loose estimates to have any practical value ; but it is only when we can put the result of such an investigation into *gures of even remote correctiless that it becomes readily intelligible . It is for this purpose only that the figures are offered . The final result of our inquiry is , then , as follows : The nominal wealth of the country is largely increased , the real wealth of the country is diminished ; the whole of the nominal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real wealth , is in the possession of the wealthy ; the poor are poorer in everything . The social changes growing out of this change in financial condition are already developing themselves . Immense concentration of capital produces great concentration of business , with corresponding economy of management , diminution of profits , and advantage to buyers , but with destruction to smaller competitors , and the forcing down of the lower classes to still lower depths . Concentration of capital makes possible great public works contro ! led by single individuals , and raises private men to positions of power and influence , in which they can corrupt courts and legislatures and overawe the public .
