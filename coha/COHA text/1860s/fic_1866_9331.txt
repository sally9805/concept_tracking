I call this poem a Libretto , because , as in a Cantata , Opera , or Oratorio , the verses may suggest or accompany a music they only in part embody . A Libretto is too often a mere thread on which the composer strings his pearls ,  --  a text for some work of art nobler than itself . While this poem makes no claim to be full-strung , it may perhaps serve to awaken a few snatches of a music containing some vital symbolic conceptions of the grandest of all harmonies ,  --  the Divine Order in Creation . C. P. C. Cambridge , December , 1873 . OH that I could sinne once see ! We paint the devil foul , yet he Hath some good in him , all agree . Sinne is flat opposite to the Almighty , seeing It wants the good of vertue , and of being . But God more care of us hath had . If apparitions make us sad , By sight of sinne we should grow mad . Yet as in sleep we see foul death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospective . George Herbert . Main text THE OVERTURE .

The swift contending fugue ,  --  the wild escape Of passions ,  --  long-drawn wail , and sudden blast , And heavy-footed bass should weave and shape The prelude of a symphony so vast , That only to the ears Of spirits listening from serener spheres Of thought , the differing tones would blend and twine Into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soul beneath the wings Of every instrument : I would enlist the deep-complaining strings Of doubt and discontent ; The low sad mutterings and entangled dreams Of viols and bassoons , Groping for light athwart the clouds and streams That drown the laboring moons ; The tones of crude half-truth ,  --  the good within The mysteries of evil and of sin ; The trumpet-cries of anger and despair ; The mournful marches of the muffled drums ; The bird-like flute-notes leaping into air , Ere the great human-heavenly music comes Emerging from the dark , with bursts of song And hope and victory , delayed too long . Ah , what are all the discords of all time But stumbling steps of one persistent life That struggles up through mists to heights sublime , Fore-felt through all creation 's lingering strife ?  --  The deathless motion of one undertone Whose deep vibrations thrill from God to God alone !

And now I hear far off the elemental roar , And the red fire-winds blowing : A low dull steady moan , a million miles away , Of whirling hurricanes that rage all night , all day . No life of man or beast , were life engendered there , Could bide the flaming winds and white metallic glare . Sixth Spirit .

Third Spirit . Third Spirit And now , behold , our wings are rapid as our thought , And nearer yet have brought Our feet , until we hover above the Asian lands Beyond the desert sands . There , girt around by mountain peaks that cleave the skies , A blooming valley lies ; A pathway sloping down from visionary heights , Through shades and dappled lights , Lost in a garden wilderness of tropic trees And flowers and birds and bees .

But alas for the sons and the daughters Of man in the morning of nations ! Alas for their rivers of waters ! Alas for their fruitless oblations ! The curse and the blight and the sentence Have fallen too swift for repentance . I see it  --  I feel it  --  O brother ! It shadows one half of the garden . O Earth ! O improvident Mother !

Raphael The vision ye have had of joy and doom , Flashing and glooming o'er two little lives , Is truth half-typed in legend , such as fed The people of the ancient days , distilled From crude primordial growths of time , when sin Saw the fierce flaming sword of conscience shake Its terror through the groves of Paradise , Grasped by Jehovah 's red right hand , in wrath .

What seemed a vapor with a ragged fringe , Changes to wings that sweep from north to south . And , round about the mass whose cloudy dome Should be a head , I see the lambent flame Of distant lightnings play . And now a voice Of broken thunder-tones , and winds and waves Commingled , muttering unintelligible things , Approaches us . The air grows strangely chill And nebulous .

No shape we distinguish ; The shadows are hopeless and voiceless . We are troubled . O help us , strong Angel ! A Form gathers out of the darkness , Awful and dim and abysmal ! Raphael . Raphael Fear not the gloomy Phantasm . Speak to him .

The Spirits . The Spirits Art happy , then ? Satan . Satan Nor happy I , nor wretched . I but do My work , as finite fate and law prescribe . The Spirits .

Nay , let the earthquake split The mountains into steep and splintered chasms :  --  Down deeper than the shock the adamant Of ages stands , symbol no less divine Of the Eternal Law , than heaven above .

The Spirits . The Spirits What if it were revealed to holy men By faith , that God had formed a spirit vast , Who fell , rebelled , tempted the race to death ?

No birds Of song and summer in its branches built Their little nests of love : no hermit sought The shivering rustle of its chilly shade . Accursed of God it stood ,  --  accursed and drear It stood apart ,  --  a thing by God and man Hated , or pitied , as a pestilence O'erpassing cure . So hate not me .

Chorus of World-Spirits The presence that awed us and chilled us Dissolves in the dews of the morning ; The darkness has vanished around us , And shrunk to the shadows that color The cloud-flakes of gold and of purple . So vanish the thoughts that obscured us , The doubt and the dread of the evil That stained the starred robe of creation ; And we hear but one music pervading The planets and suns that are shining ; The spirits that pine in the darkness , Or float in the joy of the morning .

Praise , praise ye the poets , whose pages Were wisdom and love for the ages ; Who saw , in their marvellous trances Of thoughts and of rhythmical fancies , The manhood of man in all errors ; The hopes that have triumphed o'er terrors ; The great human heart ever pleading Its kindred divine , though misleading Fate held it aloof from the heaven That to spirits untempted was given . 2 .

But praise him that in every thrill Of life his breath is in our lungs , And moves our hearts and tunes our tongues , Howe'er rebellious to his will . Praise him that all alike drink in A portion of the life divine , A light whose struggling soul-beams shine Through all the blinding mists of sin . For sooner shall the embracing day , The air that folds us in its arms , The morning sun that cheers and warms , Hold back their service , and decay , Ere God who wraps the universe With love , shall let the souls he made Fall from his omnipresent aid O'ershadowed by a human curse . The Spirit of a Poet The Spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain-top . I sang of Eden and Creation 's morn ; Of fiend and angel , triumph and despair . I caught the world 's old music in the air , The strains that from a people 's creed were born . I soared with seraphs , walked with lords of doom ; Basked in the sun , and groped in utter dark . I lit the olden legends with a spark Whose radiance but revealed eternal gloom . I stood enveloped in a cloud o'ercharged With thunder ; and the blind , mad bolts that flew Were heaven 's decrees . They spared alone the few Whose hearts by grace supernal were enlarged . Upon imagination 's star-lit wings I flew beyond the steadfast earth 's supports ; And stood within Jehovah 's shining courts , And heard what seemed the murmur of the springs , The streams of living and eternal youth .

No more the vengeance of a demon-god ; No more the lost souls whirling in black drifts Of endless pain . The illumined spirit lifts The fog where once its trembling footsteps trod . I looked , and , lo ! the abyss was all ablaze With light of heaven , and not abysmal fire ; And fain would tune to other chords my lyre , And fain would sing the alternate nights and days ,  --  The days and nights that are the wings of Time , The love that melts away the eternal chains ; The judgments only of remedial pains ; The hidden innocence in guilt and crime .

Melting away in the morning , we follow their pathways no longer , Knowing the hand that has guided will bear them for ever along , Bear them for ever , and shape them to destinies fairer and stronger Than when the joyous archangels hailed their creation with song .

Lo ! on the day-star itself there are spots that , coming and going , Send through the spaces mysterious thrillings , like omens of blight . And the great planets afar are convulsed , as when winter comes blowing Over the shuddering oceans and islands of tropical light . Shadows are shadows ; and all that is made is illumined and shaded ; Bound by the laws of its being , heaven and earth in its breath .
