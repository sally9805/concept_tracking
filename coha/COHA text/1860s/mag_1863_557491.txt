Prolegomena ad Homerum. 8vo. ilalis. 1795. 3 . Lectures on Ancient History . By B. G. NJEBtJHR. 3 vols. 8vo . London . 1852 . WHATEVER is remote from our accustomed modes of life S seems to us unnatural , and , when at an extreme from us , Unhuman . To the illiterate , the scholar is a strange being , and it requires little persuasion to convince the more ignorant that he works with supernatural agencies . Equally the scholar , if he keep himself apart from common forms of life , may often come to invest those forms with a poetic garb , and to see in the farmer ploughing a field something hardly more real and living than the same scene painted with Homer 's golden words upon the shield of Achilles . This remoteness is the natural result of habits of seclusion and of the removal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings to the past and to other scenes . So it follows that the busy world , esteeming those who are called scholars as practically divorced from humanity , because their eyes seem always turned backward into the shadowy past , regardless of the real forms moving before their bodily sense , does set apart all such as members of one great class . But this is rather a classification by exclusion , than one created by any mutual attraction through community of interests . The more we consider the members of this class , inquiring what they have sought and by what methods , we shall find , first , that they manifest an excessive individuality , arising from their solitary habits and from the subjects of their thought , - for all scholars have a Cyclopean element in their character , often strongly developed , leading them to sit on mountains apart , lawless and self-coiitained ; and , secondly , when there is a tendency to combine , we shall find hot one class , but several classes , into which they divide , - so that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to their objects and // modes of study , to comrades in thought , and they will turn each to his own by natural impulse , separating from many in the same school - if we may so extend the word - those with whom they have affinity . if the divisions into which scholars might be classified were to be carefully distinguished , they would , we think , be three in number , and they would be found successive in development ; not necessarily in respect to the general history of the world to the present day , but , what is more important , in respect to the evolution of any single epoch , or the history of any single nation . Niebuhr and Arnold both have pointed out this distinction , while they showed the fallacy of the ordinary division into ancient and modern history , the , latter being parallel to the former , rather than supplementary . Thus , while the several phases which scholarship has assumed have a logical succession , two of them may be synchronous , owing to the different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . J3ut since the scholar , by the very nature of his work , draws nourishment for his life from sources beyond the political boundaries that circumscribe him , and thus gets the benefit of progress elsewhere when his own nation is stagnant , so it will be found that these phases of scholarship , upon the whole , have had , or are having , each its period in general history . The first of these phases may be termed the curious ; using that word , of course , in its active sense . It springs from the temper of mind in which a child approaches anything new or strange . In its researches , it rejects nothing ; it simply makes collections , and derives a gratification from the abundance of its antique treasures , amassing hoards of classical facts and fancies for the very pleasure of the work . When it attempts classification , it is either on the most obvious differences and affinities , or by arbitrary and artificial laws . It is characteristic of this phase of scholarship that it is found in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work as if they should have plenty of time to finish it , and so might plan as largely and as minutely as they chose . Thus , in the Middle Age , the most noticeable period of this class , they had fellowship with the disciples of art who built the cathedrals // and illuminated the missals . With magnificent designs they coupled rare patience , and plodded on and on , as if the world wagged lazily , and there were in the womb of the present no restless movement of a giant future . The very word Scholiast indicates the leisurely character of these scholars . The creation which their labors called forth was of the most fanciful sort . In the old soil of Grecian and IRoman life they planted fantastic flowers from their own period , grotesquely intermingled with the native growth . Just as Dutch gardeners dehumanize trees and shrubs by cutting them into human shapes , so they , in the gardens of ancient literature , would cut and trim in the oddest fashion all the forms of beauty which they found , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To our modern perceptions there is something very comical in the sight of these grave men giving birth to such levity . We seem to see them , gray-bearded , and laden with years and wisdom , sitting in the sun , blowing bubbles , and watching them in their wayward flight till they vanish into thin air . How tedious to us are their fine-spun subtilties , followed with such pertinacity through all their windings . Such was , indeed , the natural result of an intellectual life swayed by superstition and disengaged from practical affairs ; and there can be no doubt that the celibacy of scholars worked much toward this result , since they were thus cut off from just what would have most effectually humanized their intellect , bringing it down from the clouds to build its structures upon a mord enduring basis . The writings of that ponderous Archbishop , Eustathius , are a good example of this phase of scholarship , when in its dominant period . To our modern habits of reading and literary work , there is something appalling in the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and these are but a part of his labors . That a man , an Archbishop too , who certainly ought to be very wise , should deliberately sit down to the collection of all the facts that may , by any possibility , be connected with Homer , is in itself a matter for contemplation . But when we begin to read , and discover the Archbishop in the act of discoursing on a line of the poet , we see how , at the rate he moves , he might easily fill very many more // volumes . We stand aghast at the interminable sentences this 1 " and then goes on in chase of a word , hunting it through all the cases , calling in the assistance of its congeners , cornering it in Euripides , losing it again , and then unearthing it in some grammarian ; and after it is fairly on its back , happening to think of the matter of the passage in which it occurs , with another " Just notice this , now , " he is off again upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse still , holds up his forefinger to admonish one of the excellent sense contained in the sentiment , and with most laborious effort explains some thought clear as crystal in Homer , but likely to be muddy enough after Eustathins has been splashing his magisterial stick in it . He treats his readers - supposing him to care anything about them - as if they were , one and all , utterly stupid , and his author as if he were utterly incomprehensible . But if one has only the patience to examine him in spots , and understands the art of judicious skipping , he will give many thanks in the end to Eustathius , and will pardon him his tediousness in consideration of his industry . It is hard work indeed to select from his mass the really valuable portions ; for he is like an ill-educated chiffonnier knocking about among old pottery , and by some bungling fortune lighting upon treasures worth finding , but for himself he has so little knowledge of the value of things that a Pompeian vase and a pitcher fresh from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not wholly passed away . There are now , and ever will be , men with the same simple objective interest in matters of antiquity . The world looks with a kind of pity , not unmingled with contempt , upon them , as they browse in our libraries , busy on endless nothings , - arriving at small conclusions upon the most important subjects , and expressing weighty opinions upon the most trivial matters , hunting quotations with the vigilance of a professional detective through all the turnings of literature , and never so happy as when they can discover some oversight or blunder . They live in all libraries , and may be found poised before the bookseller 's table . In the street they are de trop , but they // never know it , appearing utterly unconscious of the bustle about them . Their very dress is whimsical , not affected , denoting the remoteness of their life from the sterility , as they would think it , of the present . Such a man was George Dyer , whom Lamb has so affectionately quizzed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its dominant period it was natural and fitting . It is not the highest development , but it is of inestimable importance . The work which such scholars have done so cheerfully was essential to subsequent stages of learning . They made the collections for the great classical museum , and if they are illassorted , still it was of prime importance that the objects should be there . Thus Eustathius is to-day the great thesaurus for Homeric scholars . So , too , the labors of more recent scholars , who have wrought in the same spirit , are always of avail ; nor can we , even if we hold such work in light esteem , help admitting the spirit in which it is effected to be at once cheerful and healthy . We are apt to think it childish , because it is so often amusingly naive , and its possessors so unworldly-wise ; but many in our own day would sigh after just such a spirit . But this phase in its historic aspect was but preparing the way for one of higher importance . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further development of scholarship assumed a critical phase . It is impossible that the mind should always or long content itself with an interest in the mere objects of antiquity ; or that , beginning to inquire into them , it should stop at a mere fanciful playing with them , or at an arrangement according to the most apparent characteristics . The intellect , indeed , during the foregoing period , was so far swayed by reverence , and by superstition , its counterfeit , that the attitude of the scholar toward antiquity was that of wondering docility , accepting all things , and resting in them as the end . But with the reaction from this temperthe intellect being disenthralled - came a cold control over thought . Everything must be arraigned before reason , whose decisions are final . The disposition increases to take antiquity not for what it is in itself , but for what service it may render . There is a departure from the old , self-forgetting interest in 7* // the object , and a growing tendency to look at everything subjectively . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judgment is allowed , the more will it be exercised . Nothing is more insidiously tempting to the mind than the revelation of its power . Tle flattery to one 's mental power in the conscious ability to find fault or to praise with discrimination is so sweet and so subtile , that the force of the mind is more and more turned in this direction . It is the pride which whispers the fatal words , " Ye shall be as gods , " that works the destruction of simple wisdom , and builds in its place an arrogant science which measures everything by rod and plummet . It is plain how apparently infinite would be the scope allowed to the energy of the mind set in this direction . Already there exists for it a mine of wealth in the unclassified , confused heaps gathered by the representatives of the curious phase of scholarship . This is the old curiosity-shop which is to be transformed into a scientifically arranged museum ; and , indeed , it would appear as if the whole ancient world had been labelled and catalogued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , with this wide scope for its energy , the reason has achieved elsewhere no victories greater than in the field of classical erudition . Critical scholarship has carried certain subjects to a length which few ordinary scholars care to follow . An exhaustive process has been applied to literature , which bewilders one who seeks to secure the results . Out of heel-bones and finger-joints these classical anatomists have reconstructed the products of pre-historic periods , and traced , step by step , the formation of language and the progress of the arts . And for mere quantity of work , the world has never seen more prolific results of study than have appeared , especially in Germany , during the last hundred years whichwe assume to be the dominant period of this pl*ase of scholarship . The ambition of minds working in this way has been to reach the end of their subjects . In two directions has this mastering purpose driveii them . It has urged them laterally , carrying them over wide fields of research in quest of all that relates to their subject , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perseverance to pursue it to its full and ultimate development . We can not help comparing these // workers with the leisurely students of the earlier times ; the latter dreaming away their lives , rambling with indefinite purpose , stopping at all they see , in no haste to conclude , and often losing themselves in vagaries with a carelessness inimitable by art ; the former beckoned onward by the ideal of completeness , scouring wide fields that they may lose nothing essential , yet ever coming back to the main track , untempted by pleasing sights or sounds foreign to their labors . A feverish unrest pervades all their life , and their ceaseless toil depresses us with a sense of fatigue . Like Kay in Andersen 's exquisite tale , they all seem bound by the icy rule of the Snow-Queen , their hearts growing more and more chilly as they endeavor in vain to arrange the blocks of ice that shall spell the word Eternity . It is evident that , with completeness in view , the limitations of our human existence impose limitations also to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; lie must press in his work at the sides , that it may have more intense force in its proper direction ; for expansion does produce feebleness . If the whole Greek verb be too much for a life-time , it may perhaps suffice for the aorist tense . Thus , one choosing a single pin-point for his energy , another setting his mind over the course of some equally narrow line , the probability is increased that each will attain some final complete result . And it is by this minute subdivision of labor that so much has been effected . But in the very perfection of this criticism lies the reason for its most signal failure ; for in just this is critical scholarship at fault , - it takes from its devotees the power of grasping wholes . The analytical faculties become so disproportionately enlarged as to produce a corresponding loss in the constructive powers which see immediately their object . Is it not true of the Wolfian ( or Wolfish , as some would have it ) theory of Homer 's partition , that it found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had so strained their eyes over the fine dust of the Iliad that they had lost , in a measure , the capacity of seeing at a glance the beautiful entireness of the poem ? The arguments adduced were ingenious , and many of them unanswerable by a similar method , // but they were too acute ; and a plain scholar , who could have no chance in a dispute with these men , might yet have a much clearer judgment than they upon the question at issue . It was no strange thing , that among such scholars the primary argument drawn from the Iliad itself should fare so hardly as it did ; but Aristotle was right after all , and the argument is there , as plain as a pikestaff , only the scholars could not discern it because their eyes were so close to it . It was , indeed , impossible that critical scholarship so intensely active should fail at last to emerge into rank scepticism . To be able not to see a thing , comes in fact to be with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . To feel that one has the ability to judge is , as we have said , very likely to lead one into the habit of judging . It is a fine thing , we admit , to arraign a line in Hesiod upon the charge of obtaining credit on false pretences , to hear the evidence , to weig1* it , and perhaps finally to condemn the line to be expunged from all future editions . We are not disputing the value of such judgments , we are but pointing out the subtile temptation to the judge of perpetually asserting his authority . Thus the arrogance of criticism leads to change , to rejection , to annihilation . The mind becomes morbidly active , and a hunger takes hold of the reasoning power , which constantly craves some new food ; but it never is satisfied , because it is diseased . It may seem a trivial opinion , but we are inclined to think the world much the debtor to antiquity for its agency in keeping these men out of mischief , and thus contributing to universal peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other causes than to the subjects on which it expends itself , and it must , therefore , assert itself in some way ; and surely it were better for such lynx-eyes to be penetrating the mysteries of the Cabeiri , than to be peering with cold look into mysteries more sacred and more vital to us ; better , if these sheriffs will not rest without a culprit , that some unfortunate wretch like Phalaris should satisfy them , than that they should all be upon the scent of one even so culpable as Chatterton , tracking him by his blood to his warm grave ; better , if we must have a victim for the Moloch of our critical wrath , that we should // select some ancient as the sacrifice , than that we should choose a neighbor and a friend . It is hard wholly to turn from the more morbid aspect of this phase of scholarship . It arrests our attention ; for it is painfully human . Tragic indeed is the interest which attaches to these solitary , restless spirits , vainly pushing on and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of them , with the cold mists of sceptical death gathering about them . Before , we looked upon a simple , nay , childish life , trustful even to foolish credulity . We thought it healthy , and so it is in its best state ; but its health is mere freedom from sickness . There is in this second phase of scholarship , in its best condition , an impetuous , nervous life , that throws off by its vigor all impurities . It is therefore better than the first , and , if it be more liable to fail , it has a larger promise of success . It represents an advance , and that an important one . Its scepticism can not wholly destroy the faith of the former period , but only its debasing credtdity . The scholar has given up his unconsciousness of self and his simple trustfulness , but he has gained larger power for the dominant intellect . It would seem , at first glance , as if the scholarship thus far considered covered the *whole ground of the investigatioii of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two elements , criticism meeting curiosity half-way , would produce the highest development of scholarship . But what it lacked separately in its two former phases , no mere combination could supply ; for the want was a vital one . In just this does the scholarship we have considered fail , that it looks upon the antiquity which is the field of its research as something so inevitably past as to be dead . In one phase antiquity is regarded as some vast Herculaneum , where curiosity may hunt and fancy find play , but from which all life has departed ; in the other , it is , indeed , a human body , but good only as it may serve the anatomist 's skill , or be galvanized into a ghostly life by the action of the battery of scholarship . The very method of approach by these scholars toward the objects of their curiosity or the subjects of their speculation denies life and assumes death ; they act and think as if there were an eternal barrier between the past and the present , and as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tho.ugh they could not set their finger on the entering point - took leave of its ancient ways , and committed itself to new and totally different modes . In fine , they estrange themselves from the past which they study , by studying it solely as a past . It seems a trite thing to say that the instinct of a common humanity shared with the ancients is the key that opens the door to the innermost treasure-house of antiquity ; yet the very triteness of the declaration covers a profound truth . No one ever avowed the belief that the ancients were less human than ourselves , or attributed to them a different development in history ; but really , and in a manner affecting the whole method of investigation , scholars have , time and again , treated the ancients as if they were Selenites , or as if the world of the nineteenth century before Christ were essentially different from the same world in the nineteenth century after Christ . They have treated men as performers upon a stage , they themselves living a real life ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and presented us with cold images of a death simulating life . Through their labors , all the ancient modes of life seem so many non-conductors of sympathy . We approach the men and women themselves , whether of romance or of action , through such a thicket of scholastic lore , that we may be forgiven if we feel ourselves , when in their presence , shut out from the world we live in . Surely , then , it is a progress in development of the last importance , when scholarship passes from a merely curious and critical investigation of antiquity , and enters upon a living phase , regarding the past not as past but as present , looking upon it as active , and so presenting it to others . It is , indeed , the immediate consequence of such scholarship , that it becomes the interpreter of the past , and the daysman between old and new civilization . It delights in discovering the real connection between things , despite the apparent contradiction of merely exterior differences . It breaks down the unessential barriers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization are under one Master , who causes his sun and his rain to fructify each . It recognizes humanity under its most uncouth garb , and by this power annihilates time and space , and brings // alike old times and far countries into communion with the present and with its particular portion of the earth . The power by which a scholar thus realizes to himself the ancient life , is a living sympathy with the present . It has been held necessary to seclude one 's self from the present in order more completely to live in the past ; to put out of sight one 's neighbors and friends , and , by aid of the imagination , to transport one 's self to old times and far countries ; to fill the mind so completely with antique images , that the senses themselves shall conduct few new impressions to the brain , so that one thus living shall walk blindly through the crowded thoroughfares , and hear the voice of men as a distant hum . But if all realizing , humanizing aid of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pictured life ? And , upon its fair canvas , what are the active men and women who appear in the scenes , however brilliantly painted , but pictured men and women ? What are the philosophers holding discourse but marble statues , lifelike indeed in form , but col*il as death in all spiritual existence ? Nay , it is through the present only that we live in the past , and this not by idly fancying old scenes to be re-enacted on new ground , but by making the vitality of the present to reinspire the past . What affects our mental organization more than the intensity of action about us , - the throbbing of a nation 's heart , as witnessed in some grand movement of the popular will , - and , most , the humanizing influences that arise from the personal relations we hold ? If we shut ourselves from these , immured within walls of books , how do we rob ourselves of half our humanity , and thus of more than half the power to appreciate and reconstruct in ancient forms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was as glowing as that about us ! As far as one despises the joy-giving element in life , so far does he stunt his own capacity for appreciating , much more for enjoying , the same element in represented life ; so far , too , as one closes his ears to the great questions of right and wrong , or of government , or of civil institutions , so far does he fail of understanding the significance of the same questions as they appear in ancient history . The method by which one puts on record his own concep tion of this living past is not , as in the amusing classic stories // of Hawthorne , by trying to unite the old life with modern modes , but by such statement of the life common to old and new times as keeps mere modes subordinate ; nay , as shows how fitting each is to its own time , - a work which has been accomplished by Kingsley , and better by Cox . To a vivid representation poetry offers less difficulty than prose , since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to move men , that even a critical or a curious scholar may unawares own his common humanity with the author by yielding to its influence . Scholars of every sort meet nearly upon common ground when they come upon philosophy , from its very nature ; but the greatest and most important difference is found in the manner of reading and interpreting history . The scenes and events which there touch the man beneath the scholar are allied to the poetic , and governed by the same rules ; but what remains , - the growth of nations , the varied expression of national character , systems of government , and all historic changes , - these come chiefly under the notice of the intellect , and here the vitiating element of apathy enters . They are often discussed as if they were the curious parts of some vast mechanism , or the results of the action of thought upon its wide range of material . Even if all these matters have been treated so exhaustively that further search seems almost useless ; if the treatment still lacks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do not believe in them as we believe in what is going on around us . Niebuhr , in one of his Lectures , quotes the saying of some ingenious man , that " it is thought that at length people will come to read ancient history as if it had really happened . " And the same writer says , elsewhere : " We need not wonder that ancient history , on the whole , is regarded as if its events had never actually happened ; for it is commonly looked at without any attempt to understand it , and men judge of it by quite a different standard from that which is applied to modern history ; but even the latter is not understood as it should be . Hence the history of antiquity is divided into periods , without any regard to their differences ; the division , in fact , is made with the same uniformity with which the bodies of the universe are classified , and as if it were altogether forgotten // that history is a living body . " So let one read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who seemed to throw his whole energy into the present , could , with all the stronger reality , enter into the Peloponnesian war , and come back , as if he had taken part then in state affairs , to bring to his countrymen in England the result of his experience . The same truth applies with urgent force to the reading of the Bible . This becomes in our hands a dead book , especially in the historical portions , when we suffer the feeling that the abyss of time forms an impassable gulf between it and us . It is one thing to assent to the historical truth of the biography of Moses , and quite another to treat Moses in our minds as if he were a man like ourselves . So much are we under the influence of an unreal way of treating the Bible , that we often detect ourselves and others in notions with regard to it in which reason has no part . The writer remembers his shock upon noticing lately in a city paper the report of a celebration by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which festival there was a masked ball , and Esther , Mordecai , Hamaii , and others appeared in character , and , if we are not mistaken , enacted the historical scenes celebrated . A second thought showed it as a commemoration of a great event in the history of their nation ; and if the religious observance was wanting , it probably appeared no more strange to them than to us our neglect to open the churches on the Fourth of July . German rationalism is in part at least the fruit of an ignorant , superstitious use of the Bible , in which men feared to think that the personages mentioned in it had any such life of their own as they themselves had , and imputed to them an indefinable sanctity . Much , very much , do we owe to the critical scholarship that set us free from the debasing credulity of curious scholarship , which might have been reverence once , but was fast becoming dead superstition . And much more should we arrest by a living scholarship the efforts of that same criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitalizing of scholarship , such as takes place when a generation of scholars pass from critical or curious habits to those of warmer and more vivid character , is most likely to occur in connection with violent , or at least powerful , changes // in political , moral , and social organizations . Thus we find that , upon the whole , the present century is the most importaut period of this phase of scholarship . When humanity receives such a shock as the French Revolution caused , the most absent scholar is called back to the world , and all minds that have any sympathy with their kind busy themselves with the problems which events are proposing . Out of this alliance of scholarship with life comes forth the glorious form which we have seen . The world and the college of scholars know each other 's faces , and work side by side . Thus also we find that the scholarship of England in the Elizabethan era was of a vivid phase . It followed curious scholarship , and therefore was less severely accurate ; but it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most acute observations . It is , we trust , with no foolish national vainglory , but with heart-felt wish and strong hope , that we look to Anierica for the finest consummation of this pha*e of scholarship . In that Declaration of Independence which we so noisily celebrate , we did not specify the more important independence of thought which we have it in our power to possess . We showed it , indeed , in the severance , and in the provokingly new way in which we have since gone on , just the contrary in deed and manner to what was predicted . But in separating from the mother country , and in subsequent declarations of our newworld sovereignty , we did not cut ourselves off from parental experience and old-world customs ; we reiiounced no right to history , while resolving to combine the old forms anew , and to inspire them with fresh vitality . So in scholarship , we may take all the labors of those who have gone before us , and give to them our Western life . The emigrant who leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toils which a long civilization has wound about him . Scholarship is not so bound ; but it has its own restrictions , and from these we may set it free . Old formulas and traditional precepts we may sweep away , if they doThut hinder the real life . If the presence of a free , quick national existence can elevate the scholarly mind and ennoble its pursuits , that presence is with us , and its fruits will surely appear . To-day the young scholar of America is , it may be , in the trenches of Virginia , // 87 1863. or penning words of fire for the press , or speaking to churches filled with souls whose thoughts fly , while he speaks , far away to sterner scenes . Wherever he be , even if in his quiet study , he can not be blind or deaf to the surging life of his countrymen . Quiet must come at last , and with it new toils , and those of thought , for the sword can not forever be the arbiter of our destinies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must appear not thus to be solved . What is there of worth in ancient life , literature , or history ? 0 scholar ! who readest it with thine ears open to questions asked by every thoughtful American , bring it to the light that all may see . We want the old lives that have been lived ; the true words that have been spoken ; the warnings of tried ways . These are the legacy of antiquity , and to thee , 0 scholar ! belongs the trust .
