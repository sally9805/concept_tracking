Cooke , Rose Terry , 1827-1892 : ARMY VESPERS. from Army vespers ( 1864 ) The night is dark and cold , The lamp has lost its light ; The chime of midnight its tale has told , But slumber has taken flight . I can not , can not sleep , My sad soul flies away , O'er the wide and restless deep , O'er mountain , lake , and bay . Away to the lonely strand , By the lonely glittering sea , Where stretches a waste of desert sand  --  The island of Tybee . Silent the cannon 's roar , Silent and stern the ranks , Save sentry-steps on the quiet shore , And the sea on its crumbling banks . Away where wild winds rave Through the war-ships as they go , And sand or sea is the freeman 's grave , By the Gulf of Mexico . On to the mighty stream , The river of the West , Its ripples lit by the camp-fire 's gleam , And the gunboats on its breast . Where the old flag southward flies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern skies , The North-light for its bars . Back to the sacred soil , By many a fortressed hill , Where the slave hath found a right to toil , And the bayonet might to till ! Oh , sleep , that hast fled away From my fevered eyes and brow , Though never thou comest to me again , Go bless the soldiers now ! Light on the weary eyes , Like a mother 's nestling kiss , Fill every heart with sweet surprise , And home-born dreams of bliss . They fight , but we must weep For our boys that are gone and dead , God send the sleep we can not sleep To every soldier 's bed !
