Time and Scene  --  The Present . Main text ACT I. Scene 1 : A street . Enter James Shorn . Shorn . James Shelvill Ten years ago , city of sin and misery , you drove me from you for a crime of which I was guiltless ; now I return to you , after a career that would make your early charge seem lenient . Note : 1Kb Ten years ago , I left you poor , persecuted , yet innocent ; now I return to you rich , powerful , yet guilty . I will make you sob in your houses , and lament in your streets ! I will cram you with new grief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you who trampled upon my heart ! There was but one man , among this multitude of men , who raised a voice in my behalf when the world disowned me . Now , Heaven , hear me swear ! If need be , over his ruin , over all he holds dear , over his very corpse , will I stride to my revenge !  --  Enter Dreggs Dreggs . Dreggs Why , Captain Shorton !  --  Shorn . James Shelvill Interrupting him Fellow , do n't captain me . I know you , Dreggs . You were in the Texas Bank affair , and in the Isthmus-gold business .  --  Dreggs . Dreggs Oh ! yes ; and in waylaying the Ohio drovers , and in the lift from the silversmith 's in New Orleans , and  --  Shorn . James Shelvill There ! you need not brandish your crimes , as if they were virtues . Dreggs . Dreggs Well , I was in the check business , on the Charleston bank ; and I was nabbed by the beaks for it ; and I 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shelvill I told you , then , that you were a fool , and I see no reason to change my opinion ; or you would not be howling my name out in the streets . Dreggs , you were , and you are , a poor , miserable , womanish , leaky idiot ; and I only wonder how you ever got among the men . The next move you would make  --  if it were not out of your power  --  would be to betray us . Do n't you know that you must not be seen talking with me ? That , here , I am Mr. James Shorn , a rich Californian ? All this was in the last general order . Dreggs . Dreggs I have n't seen it . I 've been shut up , for priggin ' wipes . Shorn . James Shelvill Served you right , you contemptible devil ! You , who have seen service under gentlemen , to be caught stealing handkerchiefs ! For shame ! I thought a little better of you than that ! Dreggs . Dreggs I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil did n't you starve , respectably , before you became a pickpocket ? Dreggs . Dreggs Did you ever starve , sir ? Shorn . James Shelvill No . Dreggs . Dreggs Then you do n't know how hard it is to do . Shorn . James Shelvill You might have written to your officer , if you were suffering . Dreggs . Dreggs I did n't know where he lay ; besides , I ca n't write . Shorn . James Shelvill Either reason will do . Dreggs . Dreggs I got astray from the men , and did n't know where to go . Shorn . James Shelvill You have drunk away the little wit Heaven spared you . Go ! Dreggs . Dreggs I ca n't . Shorn . James Shelvill What ? Offers to strike him Dreggs . Dreggs Oh ! do n't hit me , dear Captain ! I want money , I do , indeed ! Shorn . James Shelvill For what ? Dreggs . Dreggs I 'm starving . Shorn . James Shelvill For liquor . It 's your own helpless drunkenness that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company who can not live , and spend money , as a gentleman , if he choose . Have you received nothing for the last quarter ? Dreggs . Dreggs No , indeed . Shorn . James Shelvill Here is an order on the paymaster , and a hundred dollars in cash . Gives a paper and money Now , be off to Galveston . They have use for you there . Report yourself to Lieutenant Ruff . Do you hear ? Dreggs . Dreggs Yes , sir . Shorn . James Shelvill Go by the first train to the south tomorrow . Dreggs . Dreggs I 'm off , sir . Going Shorn . James Shelvill Stop ! Do you see that man , coming roundFootnote : 1kb the corner ? I have seen him , somewhere , before  --  where ?  --  where ? Dreggs . Dreggs That 's a police . Shorn . James Shelvill The devil ! Hush ! Stand still , you infernal fool ! Enter Pike carelessly Dreggs . Dr eggs Oh ! Lord ! I wonder if he 's after me ? Shorn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I pity your misfortunes , and will do all I can to relieve you . Where did you say your family lives ? Dreggs . Dreggs Imitating the whine of a beggar In the streets  --  Lord bless you , and be merciful to you , good gentleman !  --  Not a morsel has passed these lips  --  Shorn . James Shelvill Aside to him Save rum . Dreggs . Dreggs For two whole days . Shorn . James Shelvill I will call , and see your family ; and , perhaps , send my pastor to you . In the meantime , here is a shilling , to buy bread . Gives money Dreggs . Dreggs Heaven bless you , sir ! Exit Shorn Pike . Pike It wo n't do , Peter ! Dreggs . Dreggs Could you , kind gentleman , give a poor man  --  Pike . Pike I said it wo n't do ; and when I say it wo n't do , I mean it wo n't do ! Dreggs . Dreggs Sir ! Pike . Pike Come , Dreggs , my boy , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that charitable gentleman has only lately come to his benevolence ; has n't he , Peter ? Dreggs . Dreggs For all I know , sir . I only know he 's a good , kindhearted gentleman , to a poor man who has lost  --  Pike . Pike You 'll make me angry , Peter , indeed you will , if you do n't stop your nonsense . Dreggs . Dreggs Sir ? Pike . Pike I 'll lock you up , Dreggs  --  upon my soul , I will ! I saw you take a young swell 's wipe , not half an hour ago . Dreggs . Dreggs What , this ? Produces a ragged handkerchief Pike . Pi ke No , Peter ; a ragpicker would break at that business . Cambric , Peter , all worked over with hearts , and darts , and rosebuds , by his girl . You have it , in your left-hand pocket , now . I shall be obliged to pull you , my indigent friend . Dreggs . Dreggs I found a handkerchief , sir  --  Pike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman 's pocket ; and so you picked it up . That 's the story . I know all about it . I was n't after you , Peter ; but , as you come so handy , I guess I 'll just take you along , for the sake of your delightful company . Dreggs . Dreggs Eagerly Who was you after ? Pike . Pike No ! you do n't say ! Who told you I was a fool ? When you scatter chaff , Peter , you must look up younger birds . Come along . Walk straight , Mr. Dreggs . You 've made me angry , and I 'm going to lock you up . Takes hold of him Dreggs . Dreggs No ! Pike . Pike Yes ! strange as it may appear to so virtuous a person . You must retire awhile to the seclusion of the City Prison where you can think over your few slight sins . You 'll be a sort of an involuntary hermit , St. Peter ,  --  a very holy man , no doubt . Come along , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giltwood 's house . Betsy Crum , discovered , dusting the furniture . Crum . Betsy Crum I wish there was no dust in the world . It seems to me , that everything on earth is dusty all the while , and I 'm called on to get rid of the whole of it . There 's dust in the parlor , dust in the drawing-room , dust in the chambers , dust in hall , dust on the doorsteps , dust on the pavement , dust on the winder-glass , dust on the master 's boots and mistress ' bunnet ; dry dust on every air that blows , and wet dust , well rubbed in , on the faces of all the master 's little ones ; Footnote : 1kb dust on the bride 's veil , and on the deadman 's pall ; and , at last , it 's dust to dust , and there 's an end of it ! Hang you ! Will you ever get dusty again , you awful old sofa ? I 'll rub the soul out of you ! Rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as I rub one side of you clean , the dust is flying out on the other . If I owned you , I 'd have the carpet-men beat you to death with rattans , you frightful , ugly , hard , mahogany old maid ! Note : 1Kb  --  Ugh ! but I 'm tired . Sinks upon the sofa panting . Enter Amy Giltwood . Crum rises Amy . Amy Giltwood Why , Betsy , my poor girl , what is the matter with you ? ' T is not yet nine o'clock , and you look as if you had passed through a hard day 's work . Crum . Betsy Crum Some folks ca n't look as pretty as other folks always . I suppose , it 's because I 'm not a lady , that I 'm red and ugly . Lord bless me , no ! I 've got no o ' - de- colone and milk-'er-roses , to make my face pink and smooth . I 've got no Frenchified bunnets , and shawls , and frocks , to set me off like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh  --  if I 'm sorry , I must n't cry  --  if I 'm sick , I must n't faint ; ' cause that ' ud be ridickellous in a servant  --  gall ! Amy . Amy Giltwood I had no intention of raising such a storm of words . What has put you into this passion ? Crum . Betsy Crum That old , four-legged , quadderped of a sofa ! Amy . Amy Giltwood Indeed ! Laughing Crum . Betsy Crum Yes , mam ; and I give you warning , Mrs. Giltwood , if you do n't have that sofa sent out ' er the house , I must go  --  that 's all , mam ! Amy . Amy Giltwood What is the sofa 's fault ? Crum . Betsy Crum I hate it ! and I ai n't a-going to pass my life a-dustin ' it , and a-slighten ' its betters . It has broke my heart , it has ; and I wo n't stand it any longer ! Amy . Amy Giltwood Betsy , if the sofa really makes you unhappy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant is a rare thing , in this part of the world , and I would not part with you for so trifling a cause . You have been a kind , faithful nurse , in my hours of pain and illness , and  --  Crum . Betsy Crum Interrupting her There ! You 're always a-makin ' fun of me , and a-throwin ' the children 's births up to me , as if they was my own . Well , I suppose , you brought the naughty little provokins home . And I suppose , Neddy has been a-playin ' marvels in the sweeps , while you held your sunshade over ' em . And Amy has tore her best new frock , a-runnin ' after a beggar gall ; and they 're both dirt , from head to foot , and want scrubbin ' , like two little , rusty , old iron pots  --  drat ' em ! Amy . Amy Giltwood No such calamity has happened . We only went to the flower-garden , to buy bouquets for their father . Each of the children is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body ; and they are now waiting , to waylay Mr. Giltwood , as he comes from his room . Has he been down yet ? Crum . Betsy Crum No , mam , I wonder what 's the matter with him too ? He do n't sleep well . I know it by the awful state his bed 's in . Then , he sets a-starin ' at the fire , as if he could tell his fortun in it ; and he 's always after the nusepapers  --  he had ' em to bed with him this morning ; and often he comes to breakfast with his slippers on wrong feet ; and often he do n't hear you when you speaks to him ; and often , when I speaks to him  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Interrupting her That will do , Betsy ; this is no concern of yours . Crum . Betsy Crum Oh ! yes ; I suppose , I 'd better mind my bizness ! I suppose , I ai n't got no heart  --  not I ! Amy . Amy Giltwood Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart too . Crum . Betsy Crum Then , I suppose , I 'd better swaller my " large , kind and faithful heart , " and keep it to myself ! Well , things ai n't right about this house  --  I know that ; and they do n't go on as they ust to . Well , I suppose , you think , Mrs. Giltwood , I 'd better go scrub , and dust , and scour my fingers sore ; and earn my daily bread as I oughter ? I know what you 're thinkin '  --  I know what you 're thinkin ' !  --  Betsy Crum 's a idle , good-for-nothin ' vagerbone , and I mus ' change her  --  I mus ' ! Amy . Amy Giltwood Smiling I assure you , I have no such remarkable thoughts . Crum . Betsy Crum You may do wus , Mrs. Giltwood  --  you may do wus  --  you may do wus  --  Exit Amy . Amy Giltwood Poor creature ! her whole inner life is one unending ferment . She never drew a dispassionate breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That which she said of Edward is true , however . There is something upon his mind which I might lighten perhaps . Ah ! men , men ! if we , simple women , were permitted to share your dark counsels , at least one half of the secret misery of your toiling lives would vanish before our smiles . But so it is ; the pursuit of wealth seems to be a sacred and dangerous mystery , which woman 's weak service would profane . Enter Giltwood hastily with two bouquets which he flings upon a table Gilt . Edward Giltwood Is my breakfast ready , Amy ? Amy . Amy Giltwood Nearly . Gilt . Edward Giltwood I must to business . There seems to be a miserable want of punctuality about this house . Whenever I am in it , I am continually waiting for something . Where have you been so early ? Amy . Amy Giltwood To a flower-garden . Did you not see the children ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Yes , yes ; they gave me some flowers or something . Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Are those your best thanks for their beautiful bouquets ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood It was very kind in them , no doubt . But , really , I can not approve of this mode of dribbling away money . Amy . Amy Giltwood The happiness which they enjoyed would have been cheap at any price . They have talked of nothing , but their pretty presents to you for the last hour . I hope , you did not receive them coldly . Gilt . Edward Giltwood I believe not . I might have kissed them , to be sure  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Did you not ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood No ; I had not time . I tell you what , Amy , when a man 's head is as full of important business , as mine is , he has something better to do than kiss his children . Amy . Amy Giltwood Something else , perhaps , Edward ; but not something better . The kiss of a parent , laid on the forehead of a child , is as holy as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , there ! You are about to repeat some sentimental stuff from your everlasting poets . What has the nineteenth century to do with poetry ? Amy . Amy Giltwood Too little perhaps , for its own good ; but poetry will have much to do with the nineteenth century . It will either embalm the years in a cloud of immortal fragrance , or hand them down to wondering posterity in a gloom as dense and odious as that which horrified our childish fancies at the bare mention of the Dark Ages . Edward , shall I never convince you that poetry is a substantial thing : That its curse is worse than death , it is infamy , and its praise is eternal fame ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood This is very fine . Amy . Amy Giltwood It is very true . It seems disagreeable to you , however ; therefore , let us talk of other things . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Yes ; just now , of breakfast . Amy . Amy Giltwood What is your hurry ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , I assure you . Do you know that the best paper is offered , in the market , at two per cent a month , with no buyers at that rate ? that stocks are as flat as poetry ? that grain is down , cotton down , shipments of gold enormous ? the Californian steamer not in ; and the banks grinding us to powder , in order to save themselves ? Do you know that a monetary plague , worse than the cholera , is passing over the land ; and that it threatens to sweep us all into nothingness ? Is this not enough to hurry the devil ? Amy . Amy Giltwood Is there no hope ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Hope ! What has hope to do with dollars and cents ? Their motion is like that of an inflexible machine , crushing all before them . Talk of rigid fate , or immutable law , or any horrible and uncontrollable power you can fancy ; but never whisper hope in connection with " the almighty dollar ! " Amy . Amy Giltwood Tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Giltwood Pshaw ! you could not understand me . Amy . Amy Giltwood Am I incompetent ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood No , no ; you women have brains enough for your own affairs ; but , when you come to business , why  --  I 'll leave the sentence unfinished , for the sake of my gallantry . Amy . Amy Giltwood There it is ! You judge without a trial . If you come home careworn or ill , and I ask the cause  --  it is " business " ! If your thoughts wander , when I try to amuse you  --  it is " business " ! If you smile sadly on the children , while they use their pretty arts to attract you  --  it is " business " ! If you toss in your sleep , or wakeFootnote : 1kb with a frightful dream  --  it is " business " ! If you put me from you , a little quickly , when my loving arms would hold you longer  --  it is still " business " ! This dreary spectre haunts you forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is pushing me from your heart ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood Embracing her No , no  --  Heaven bless you !  --  not so bad as that . I love you as well as ever ; only  --  well , well , you must not perplex your foolish little head with such ideas . Leave me alone with my disease . The crisis has come , and a few hours will make or mar me forever . After that , you shall suffer no more from business , my sweet wife .  --  I wish to Heaven the Occident were in . Enter a servant Serv . Servant Mr. Shorn . Amy . Amy Giltwood Who is he ? At such an hour too ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood I do not know ; I never heard of him . Show him in , however ; he may have some news . Exit servant . Enter Shorn . Amy walks apart Gilt . Edward Giltwood Good morning , sir ! Be seated . Offers a chair Shorn . James Shelvill By Jupiter , Edward , this passes belief ! Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not that pleasure . Shorn . James Shelvill We were not strangers once . I am James  --  Gilt . Edward Giltwood Interrupting him James Shelvill ! Why bless your soul , how you have changed ! But , my dear fellow , this is a sort of premature and unauthorized resurrection . You were reported to be dead long ago , years before my marriage . You are welcome to life again , however , James Shelvill  --  Shorn . James Shelvill Interrupting him Not as James Shelvill , Edward . If you retain the slightest trace of friendship to me , forget that disgraced and painful name . A whisper of it , in this city , might expose me to new persecutions . I dropped it , when I left you , into the grave where I am supposed to lie ; and I have not returned to take it up again . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Do n't let that old affair dash your spirits . You are not the first man , Shelvill  --  Shorn . James Shelvill Interrupting him Shorn , if you please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret ; if you should mention it to any one , under any circumstances whatever , you shall never see my face again . Gilt . Edward Giltwood It is a slight thing to do for you , and I promise to observe your wishes most religiously . Shorn , Shorn , Shorn ! I must not forget that name . I must not forget that name . Well , Mr. Shorn , what is your present condition ? Prosperous and rich , perhaps ; honest and generous always , to that I 'll swear . Shorn . James Shelvill Yes , to your first two statements ; the latter two are a matter of opinion . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Not with me . Oh ! James , I have so much to tell you . I have been married , since we parted , to the sweetest little mortal  --  Here , darling ! Amy advances Let me present you to my old friend , Mr. Shel  --  hang it ! Mr. Shorn . Shorn . James Shelvill Starting . Aside Ha ! Amy Startle ! Is that lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I not be proud of her ? Shorn . James Shelvill Aside Proud ! You should be the most wretched of men . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Well ? Shorn . James Shelvill Excuse me , madam . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Pshaw ! No " madams . " Call her Amy ! I call her Amy . Shorn . James Shelvill Aside Better for you had you never breathed her name . Amy . Amy Giltwood Where have I seen that face , and heard that voice ? Mr. Shorn , have we not met before ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Hang it ! Call him James ; his name is James . Look you , good people , I shall not permit any ceremony between you two . Where are you staying , James ? You must come straight to us.  --  Must he not , Amy ? Shorn . James Shelvill Perhaps , Mrs. Giltwood does not desire the intrusion of one who is a perfect stranger to her , if not to her husband . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Laughing Ha ! ha ! ha ! Speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A stranger ! I was mistaken then . It has been a rule of my life , Mr. Shorn , to extend my welcome to all whom my husband calls friends . On this occasion , I shall not depart from it . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Boo ! Amy , you are preaching ; and as coldly , too , as if your sermon were a written one . Come , my dear , you must warm up some room in your heart for my old friend , even if he occupy a part of mine . Amy . Amy Giltwood My house is more under my control than my heart ; and I will endeavor to make it look cheerful to Mr. Shorn , if only for your sake , Edward . Shorn . James Shelvill Mrs. Giltwood , I beg that you will offer no hospitality to me , for your husband 's sake . Under the roof where I lodge , I must be received for my own sake , or not received at all . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Come , come , James ! you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only her manner to strangers . Amy , I am ashamed of you . Apart to her Amy . Amy Giltwood Aside So am I of myself . My duty urges me to be hospitable , yet my heart shrinks from the office . Shorn . James Shelvill To prove to you , Edward , that I am not proud  --  at least with you  --  I accept Mrs. Giltwood 's equivocal invitation . If I should find myself positively unendurable , I can beat a retreat at any moment . Gilt . Edward Giltwood That 's right ! But you mistake Amy altogether . Does he not , my dear ? Amy . Amy Giltwood I hope so . Mr. Shorn shall have no reason to complain of me again while he remains with us . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Well said ! Now shake hands , and be friends . You are the most difficult pair to introduce , entirely , I ever undertook . It has taken me a quarter of an hour , only to get your hands together . They shake hands : she reluctantly Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , cold fingers closed around my hand , as if they were governed by a spring of steel ; and the stern pressure numbed my arm , and sent my blood back , half frozen to my trembling heart ! If I were superstitious , I should say that I had shaken hands with the dead . Shorn . James Shelvill Aside Oh ! Heaven ! what memories crowded back on me , with the light touch of that warm palm ! I should relent , and play the waterish fool , had I not felt that marriage ring turn , like a serpent , beneath my finger 's tip ! What devil prompted her to offer me her left hand , when the right is dedicated to such uses ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood You are the most romantic couple I have had the pleasure of meeting for some time . You hardly shake hands , before you both start aside , and begin mumbling to yourselves like the patchwork heroes of a high-strung tragedy . What in the deuce  --  to come down to simple prose  --  possesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my dear fellow . When two inharmonious natures join hands , for the first time , it is no ordinary action for either party . You may account for the emotion on chemical principles . Amy . Amy Giltwood Or on the mechanical principles , Edward . Mr. Shorn shakes hands as if he were a hand-shaking machine . Shorn . James Shelvill I prefer the chemical ; they are more hidden and subtle . Amy . Amy Giltwood And I the mechanical ; they are more evident and honest . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Well done , both ! Wits should be friends . Amy . Amy Giltwood No ; wits should be foes , or wit loses its edge . Gilt . Edward Giltwood What say you to that , James ? Shorn . James Shelvill When two edges meet , the softer must suffer . Amy . Amy Giltwood I shall refine my wit to your temper , if I stand in danger . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Then it will be " diamond cut diamond . " Shorn . James Shelvill Bowing Mrs. Giltwood is , doubtless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am content to be baser glass ; and only beg that she will write her fair name upon my very heart . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Bravo ! gracefully turned ! Amy , you can say nothing to that . Now that you begin to banter each other , I am sure that you will end by becoming friends . Shorn . James Shelvill I have no higher ambition . Edward , you questioned me regarding my worldly affairs ; how do you stand yourself ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Upon the unstable foundation of a man in business . To be circumstantial ; I have a heavy payment to make this day , and the means to meet it are all in that tardy steamer , the Occident . She is now overdue by a week or more . You know the financial blight that rests uponFootnote : 1kb the market . A man who was begged to borrow thousands , at common interest , scarce a month ago , can hardly obtain hundreds , at any interest , now . Shorn . James Shelvill I have always held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him plenty of bank credit . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Sound doctrine , as I know to my cost . If I get out of this scrape , I promise you to hoard my money in an old stocking , and abjure bank credits forever . Shorn . James Shelvill Then there is still hope for you . But do not trouble yourself about these payments . I have enough for you , and something over . Gilt . Edward Giltwood At what interest ? Shorn . James Shelvill Fie ! you inveterate trader ! at no interest . Gilt . Edward Giltwood James !  --  Shorn . James Shelvill What is the matter with you ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood What a weight passed off with that breath ! I will be frank with you . I was on the verge of bankruptcy . Amy . Amy Giltwood My husband ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood It is too true , Amy . Had not the Occident , or James Shorn , arrived today , I should have been a bankrupt . Amy . Amy Giltwood And I in utter ignorance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would have sold my last garment  --  I would have starved myself , I would have starved my children , I would have starved all my family , save you Edward  --  to rescue you from your peril . And here I have been inventing wants  --  hunting the town down for silks , laces , India shawls , jewels , plate , horses , carriages  --  I have rivalled firmly settled millionaires in extravagance  --  I have made my establishment the wonder and envy of the vulgar rich  --  I have wasted on vanity more than would have supported a hundred families  --  while you were struggling against the ruin which I was making inevitable . I humbly ask your forgiveness , for I shall never forgive myself . Weeps Gilt . Edward Giltwood Embracing her My poor wife , you are not to blame . I urged you to all that you did ; I fostered your fine taste . It made me proud , to see upstart wealth quail before your severely critical eye . I delighted in seeing you courted and feared by the touchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to be the idol of a class , whose chief claims to eminence are that they are rich enough to be ostentatious , and insolent enough to set their feet upon the poor man 's neck . Like you , I am cured of such desires ; but while they lasted , I was content to toil like a slave , so you might reign like an empress . It was very silly , I confess . Amy . Amy Giltwood Yet its lesson shall be fruitful to both of us . Mr. Shorn , you think that I have been discourteous to you .  --  Away with courtesy ! it has no laws for a grateful heart , and no language for its feelings ! I could embrace you , as a brother ; Heaven knows that I will pray for you every day ! Shorn . James Shelvill Really , madam , you overwhelm me . I merely offer to lend Edward a few dollars , and straight your heart is in my hand . If such hearts as yours can be purchased , at so low a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , with a large capital . Amy . Amy Giltwood You treat your virtues lightly . It is not the money which you lend , but the noble spirit which dictated it , that awakens my enthusiasm . I know what it is for so proud a man as Edward Giltwood to fail ; and I also know what a service is done him by the man who saves him from it . Shorn . James Shelvill Enough , and more than enough ! Edward 's bright face outshines my miserable gold , and makes me ashamed of the poverty of my offering . Amy . Amy Giltwood And you are happy now , Edward ? Will you kiss the children for their pretty flowers ? Will you always confide in me ; and not put me off with a mere word , when I ask you about your mysterious " business " ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Yes , indeed , Amy , to all your questions . Come , let us go to breakfast . Hand Amy down , James . All things look hopeful again . Amy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said there was no hope in dollars and cents . Oh ! yes , there is hope in everything ! Hope is the omnipresent voice of Heaven , crying aloud through the dark chambers of the human heart . Footnote : 1kb It sings a glad song to us , from the cradle to the crutch ; and , as the grave opens to receive us , its voice rises from the depths  --  as when a chapel 's doors are swung out before the rejoicing organ  --  into a thunderous anthem of joy and thanksgiving ! Shorn . James Shelvill Aside And fate has doomed me to spread desolation through so glorious a nature ! Footnote : 1kb Exeunt ACT II . Scene 1 : The breakfast-room in Giltwood 's house . Giltwood , Shorn , and Amy Giltwood , discovered at the table . Giltwood reading a newspaper . Servant-in-waiting , etc . Amy . Amy Giltwood My dear , do put down the newspaper ; your tea will be quite cold . Gilt . Edward Giltwood In a moment , Amy . Very interesting money article . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering under an epidemic of crime . For the last week , the town has been infested by incendiaries and thieves . But I suppose you know that . How long have you been in the city ? Shorn . James Shelvill About a week . Your tea is excellent , Mrs. Giltwood . Gilt . Edward Giltwood A whole week , and this your first visit to us ! Shorn . James Shelvill I was prevented by business from  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood That will do , Mr. Shorn . Business is Edward 's final excuse for everything . If he can not take it , he should not offer it .

She falls upon her face . Pike comes from behind the curtain ; and exits thoughtfully ACT III . Scene 1 : The private office of Elton 's banking-house . Enter Giltwood and Elton . Elt . Mr. Elton Mr. Giltwood , there is no necessity for prolonging this conversation . After your notes have been protested , your creditors may grant you an extension ; at present , I can not . Gilt . Edward Giltwood But it is the protest I wish to avoid . The idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have nothing to do with feelings . A bank is a mere machine , for the more convenient transaction of business . You know that , as well as I do ; and I am really astonished that a man of your understanding , can expect us to depart from our established rules . Gilt . Edward Giltwood But there are certain cases which , I hoped , might touch the feelings of even a banker . I have been particularly unfortunate , Mr. Elton . I should have had ample means to meet my engagements had the Occident arrived ; or had the southern mail , which contained the funds of a friend , not been robbed on the way hither . Today , my storehouse has been burned to the ground ; and the office that insured my goods failed before the fire was extinguished . You see to what a combination of mishaps I owe my present position . Elt . Mr. Elton Very well ; what have I to do with all this ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Mr. Elton , you are unfeeling . Six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , you came to me , hat in hand , and begged me to borrow a portion of your idle funds . I refused . You persevered ; you filled my head with speculations ; you decoyed me into my ruin ! Elt . Mr. Elton Sir ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood Aye , I repeat it . You talked of shipments to California , of the immense returns which they had made ; you opened before me schemes of sudden wealth . I relied on your experienced judgment ; I was fool enough to believe you ; and this is my return . Elt . Mr. Elton I can not control the money-market . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Then you should not base your promises upon it . You prophesied an easy money-market for the next twelve-month . You bankers have much to answer for . When money is plenty , you entice us into speculation by begging us to borrow ; and then , at the least change in the prospect , you call in your loans , before we have reaped the benefits of them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my case , and it has been that of a thousand others . Elt . Mr. Elton Really , Mr. Giltwood , I have no time to waste on this discussion . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Circumstances , of a private nature forbid that I should ask a favor of the holder of my notes , Mr. Tapeley . You refuse to do it for me . My case seems desperate . What would you advise me to do ? Elt . Mr. Elton Break . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Good Heaven ! Mr. Elton , can you look me in the face , in that cool way , and offer such advice ? It is a proverb that banks have no heart ; I fear that some of their officers are in a like predicament . Elt . Mr. Elton You are impertinent , sir ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood No ; you have taken away the spirit to be so . Elt . Mr. Elton Go to your creditors . Your notes are with me for collection only . I have no interest whatever in them .  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I fear your creditors will show you but little mercy . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Rumors regarding me ? Elt . Mr. Elton Much to your discredit . Gilt . Edward Giltwood How ! Elt . Mr. Elton It is reported that you know more about the fire at your warehouse than anyone else . Gilt . Edward Giltwood It is a base lie ! Elt . Mr. Elton Hum ! hum ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood What , do you give credence to the falsehood ? Confess that belief , if you dare , and I will offer you such an insult as no gentleman can receive ! Elt . Mr. Elton Come , this is no place for your theatrical rages . Mr. Giltwood , I have the honor of wishing you a very good morning ! Bows Gilt . E dward Giltwood Mr. Elton , do you know what is the greatest curse of this perverted world ? Do you know what it is that blinds man to nature , and blocks up the pathway between earth and Heaven ? Do you know what can turn the heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know what can still the bounding blood of youth , and dry up the narrow veins of age ? Do you know what can make the intellect and education lick the dust from the feet of folly and ignorance ? Do you know what can make the most delicate refinement servile to the most brutal vulgarity ? Do you know what can load the scales of justice , and blunt her sword ? Do you know what fills the hospital , the almshouse , the jail , and stretches the accursed cord of the gallows ? Do you know what can break all the Decalogue , create every crime forbidden in Holy Writ , and invent new ones too numerous and too odious for language ? Do you know what draws tears from the angels , and peals of laughter from the fiends ? Do you know what keeps Heaven empty , and makes Hell groan with its myriads ? I can answer all these terrible questions , and in one word  --  Money ! Exit Elt . Mr. Elton Upon my soul , a very excitable young man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should go into politics which , I believe , was invented by some humane individual as a sort of general charity , a refuge for those who have proved themselves unfit for all other kinds of business . Enter Amy with a basket Amy . Amy Giltwood Mr. Elton ? Elt . Mr. Elton At your service , madam . Pray be seated . Amy . Amy Giltwood No , I thank you : I shall detain you a moment only . The gentleman who just left you , Mr. Giltwood , was he successful in his mission ? Elt . Mr. Elton If you consider his mission to be that of an anti-monetary declaimer , he was very successful indeed . I never heard such a tirade against everything that was , is , or may be , in the whole course of my life . Amy . Amy Giltwood Excuse me , sir ; but I would rather listen to no jests regarding that gentleman . I remained outside your office , for purposes of my own , until I saw him depart ; and now I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Before we go further , in another man 's private affairs , I should like to know what relation you bear to him ? Amy . Amy Giltwood I am his wife . Elt . Mr. Elton I supposed as much . Amy . Amy Giltwood I came here with no purpose of appealing to your feelings . This is a matter of business , and should be so treated . Elt . Mr. Elton A very sensible view of the affair . Amy . Amy Giltwood Mr. Giltwood 's notes are due today . His funds are , as he has perhaps informed you , in the missing steamer , Occident . I am quite ignorant of business etiquette , but if the payment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valueless property , would be a sufficient inducement for you to grant him a little time  --  say , a week , or two or three days  --  I am ready to offer you security . Uncovers her basket See , sir , here are my jewels  --  quite superfluous , I assure you  --  and a small package of trinkets which I will place in your hands . At home , I have other costly property  --  such as laces , India shawls , robes , furs , plate , and so forth  --  which I have written down in this schedule . Offers a paper They are all entirely at your disposal , on condition  --  Elt . Mr. Elton Interrupting her Good Heaven ! Madam , I am not a pawnbroker ! You are , doubtless , quite innocent of wrong ; but , really , you are wounding me very deeply . Amy . Amy Giltwood There can be no insult in intentions as earnest as mine . Elt . Mr. Elton Mrs. Giltwood , I shall offer you the advice which I lately gave your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both you and Mr. Giltwood seem to forget that I have no power over them . Amy . Amy Giltwood Who are the persons to whom you refer me ? Elt . Mr. Elton The owner of the bulk  --  nay , when I come to think of it  --  the owner of the whole of them is a large capitalist , to whom they came in the course of business . But , I fear , your labor will be lost ; for Mr. Tapeley is not a man to surrender  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Interrupting him Mr. Tapeley ?  --  an old gentleman ?  --  a lawyer ? Elt . Mr. Elton The same . Amy . Amy Giltwood He is saved ! He is saved ! Heaven bless you , for your kindness in mentioning that name ! Why , sir , Mr. Tapeley was an old friend of my father : I grew to girlhood under his eye . To be sure , my marriage with Edward offended him a little , on account of some differences between them ; but when he understands our misfortunes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head ? Elt . Mr. Elton Because , madam , you do not appear to know how little such things enter into a man 's ideas of business . Amy . Amy Giltwood Oh ! sir , his heart enters into everything he does . You do not know Mr. Tapeley as I do , or you would not suspect his generosity . You still doubt ? Well , I can try , I can try . If I fail , I shall at least feel that I have done my duty . Elt . Mr. Elton Mr. Tapeley 's office is in  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Interrupting him I know where it is . I have not lost sight of him , though he seems to have forgotten me . Good day , Mr. Elton !

James Shelvill It is currently reported that he set fire to his own warehouse , in order to obtain the insurance . Elt . Mr. Elton I have no doubt of it , not the least . Shorn .

Elt . Mr. Elton Well , I think we can manage it . Tapeley is a friend of mine , and I 'll take the responsibility of selling the notes , if we can agree on terms . Shorn . James Shelvill It would be doing Mr. Tapeley a service . Elt . Mr. Elton I really think so . Shorn . James Shelvill Further , my name is not to appear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be protested , as if they belonged to Mr. Tapeley ; though I pledge myself to pay them afterwards . If Giltwood should redeem them in time , the whole matter goes for nothing . These notes are of no use to me , unless they be protested . I desire them for an after purpose , to have a certain hold upon this Giltwood . You see , Mr. Elton , I am talking you into my confidence . Elt . Mr. Elton Upon my soul , sir , I see nothing of the kind . This is a very curious and incomprehensible affair , Mr. Shorn ; and it places me in an extremely awkward situation . Really , sir , I must decline having anything to do with it . Shorn . James Shelvill Indeed ? I 'll tell you why you will oblige me . You will oblige me , because you said that Giltwood was an incendiary and a swindler ; because you said that his wife was a wanton , and plainly hinted at your own share in her infamy . Because Edward Giltwood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquaintance with our conversation , would not hesitate to add another ounce of lead to the already weighty number which you carry upon your shoulders . I have a close personal friendship with that dangerous character , and shall feel it my duty  --  Elt . Mr. Elton Interrupting him Good Heavens ! Come into the front office , Mr. Shorn . I have no doubt that I shall be able to satisfy you . Walk in , Mr. Shorn , walk in . Bows Shorn off , and exeunt . Aside Upon my word , this Mr. Shorn is rather a sharp man of business .

James Shelvill What ? Ah ! there is the sorrow ! I will out with it , if he kill me ; I have no right to conceal the dishonor of my friend , of his children , from him who  --  Oh ! I can not , can not get further . Gilt . Edward Giltwood You have heard how the town slanders me . Shorn . James Shelvill Has it got abroad ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood I refer to the miserable falsehood about the fire at my warehouse . Let them bring it to trial : I court , and defy investigation . Have you seen Amy ? Shorn . James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the name of mercy , are you driving at ? Shorn . James Shelvill Hear me , Edward , but be patient .

Edward Giltwood Her !  --  Who ? Shorn . James Shelvill Of course , you know that your wife is fearful of losing her position in society ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood That is quite natural . Shorn . James Shelvill If you fail , she must lose it . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Undoubtedly ; I know that . Shorn . James Shelvill Would you believe that the frivolities of fashion have taken such a hold on her ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood They have not . You heard what she said , this morning , about selling out her establishment . Shorn . James Shelvill A mere ruse . Her plan , as she confessed to me , was even then formed . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your credit . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Heaven bless her for it ! Shorn . James Shelvill Peace ! Peace ! your blessing is blasphemy . Gilt .

Edward Giltwood Speak out , and speak quickly ; or as she lives , and I love her , I 'll strangle you in the open street ! Seizes him Shorn . James Shelvill Before I speak , I can promise full and sufficient proof of all I say . You requested her to remain at home ; do you know that she is even now running about the streets  --  paying visits , and so forth ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Most disgraceful ! Shorn . James Shelvill This morning , when we were alone together , although she must have known that I was using all my power in your favor , she offered me  --  indirectly , Edward , with proper and lady-like delicacy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition that I would save your credit  --  Gilt .

I do not think at all . I know , James Shelvill , that you are a scoundrel and a liar ! Shorn . James Shelvill I was prepared for this , Edward . I should have said the same to a third person . I know that my life is in your hands , and I am willing to yield it to you  --  Gilt . Edward Giltwood Interrupting him But you spoke of proof , proof . Shorn . James Shelvill You shall have it , if you consent to overhear a conversation between us  --  conclusive proof .

Promise me to treat her kindly , until you are convinced of her perfidy ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood James , you act as a generous man , who has been persuaded against your will , but you are deceived . Shorn . James Shelvill I would beg in the streets , to believe so . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Has this , too , fallen upon me ? Lend me your arm ; for I have scarce strength to stand alone . How dare she meet me , after I ordered her to keep at home ? Enter Amy Amy . Amy Giltwood Aside Edward ! If he send me home , I shall not see Mr. Tapeley after all . Shorn .

The papers are all written in a difficult cipher : that must delay discovery . I have stationed my spies in every part of the police office , to give me early warning . No ! I will not be frightened from my designs by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is clear . How can it be that plans , which have baffled the world for years , shall be discovered in a day ? Poh ! I terrify myself with shadows . Enter Giltwood Gilt . Edward Giltwood I have come home , according to my promise , a miserable , heartsick man . In a few hours , the public voice will declare me a bankrupt . It has already whispered that I am a criminal ; and , in truth , I am so broken down and wretched , that I begin to doubt my own honesty . Shorn . James Shelvill You must not give way to fancies . You should face destiny , nay , trample upon it , as I have done . Gilt . Edward Giltwood You counsel with pride of Satan , another , with the humility of a saint ; yet the issue of your counsel is the same : I must bear up . Footnote : 1kb Test your philosophy in your own life , before you prescribe it to another . Well , what of Amy ? I suppose I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I must smile at my own dishonor ; I must laugh at it , as the world will laugh at it ? This is all very beautiful in theory  --  it is happiness made easy upon paper ; but it is not human ; and I , abject and down-trodden as I am , have not ceased to be a man . Shorn . James Shelvill Poor fellow  --  Gilt . Edward Giltwood Peace ! You have wasted sympathy enough on me . Give me the proof of Amy 's falsehood , which you pledged yourself to do ; and if I do not meet it with manly fortitude , I will grapple it with fiendish rage . Something shall be done . I will not sink into this lethargy of mind and body , without a struggle , if I die in the effort . Shorn . James Shelvill I will , Edward . That much I owe to your honor . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Honor !  --  pish ! The word seems strange and unnatural to me . Honor flew to Heaven long ago ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more destructive to man than the first deluge . Footnote : 1kb Away ! with your wordy virtues , that only live in terms ! I , for one , will henceforth be a natural man . Note : 1Kb If Amy prove false in the trial , I 'll drive her from the door of this house , as I would a thief . If you have even erred in judgment , take care , and fly betimes . I 'll hear no explanation of your course , no cry for mercy , no appeal to the remorseless fire that burns within me ; but , on this spot , I 'll tear you limb from limb ! Shorn . James Shelvill And I will offer no resistance . Edward , Edward , it wrings my heart , to think that we two have seen the day when such words can pass between us ! You need forgiveness , and I forgive you . Gilt . Edward Giltwood You see that I am not moved by your words . Grief has fallen upon me , drop after drop , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! From this day , Footnote : 1kb I will neither call man friend , nor woman wife . I am disgusted with you , one and all ! Shorn . James Shelvill Your wife is coming : I heard her chamber-door close . Gilt . Edward Giltwood What will you do with me ? Is she so bold in crime that she will speak before me ? Shorn . James Shelvill You must secrete yourself . Gilt . Edward Giltwood That 's thievish ; and , in your catalogue of terms , might be called dishonorable . Well , man , why do you stare at me with such perplexity ? I am ready for your contemptible purpose . You must not be too nice with a bankrupt incendiary ; it is but little more , to prove him a wittol . Shorn . James Shelvill Edward , you will kill me with your bitterness . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Fie ! sir ; you are faint-hearted . Come , begin ! Shorn . James Shelvill Conceal yourself within this closet . Opening a closet Gilt . Edward Giltwood What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine ; they belong to my creditors . Ha ! you can trust me ? That 's fair , but hardly wise . Enters a closet Shorn .

Amy Giltwood That is strange : I thought I heard his voice . Shorn . James Shelvill He was here awhile ago , but  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Interrupting him Well , well , what news ? Is the Occident in ? Has he raised the money ? Are we safe ? Say yes , Mr. Shorn , for today at least . Shorn . James Shelvill I am sorry  --  Amy . Amy Giltwood Interrupting him Ah ! you are sorry ! and that means all you can say ? I want a word to express the misery I suffer . Can you do nothing ? Shorn . James Shelvill Nothing . Amy . Amy Giltwood Not for the offer which I made ? It was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him apart , and whispers I would not be overheard . Edward hates Mr. Tapeley so much , that he would not forgive me , if the act saved him . But do you take this note , and all the useless jewels and finery , to Mr. Tapeley ; and see if such a spectacle of misfortune do not move his feelings . I know that it will , more than words could . Shorn . James Shelvill I can not , madam . What do you take me for ? Amy . Amy Giltwood Oh ! you men are so proud , so foolishly proud . Now I could beg , in such a cause , and feel no qualm of pride . Shorn . James Shelvill I believe it . You have such abject thoughts to struggle against , that pride could hardly find a refuge in your heart . Amy . Amy Giltwood You are severe . But I will not quarrel with you ; because I wish this thing done . Shorn . James Shelvill You ask in vain . Had you an angel 's tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dishonorable an affair . Think of my friend Edward 's reputation . Amy . Amy Giltwood But neither he nor anyone need know , if we are prudent . Shorn . James Shelvill Your humiliating proposal would be worse than bankruptcy . Amy . Amy Giltwood You mistake . Only save his credit , and I am willing to suffer almost any personal humiliation . You will not do it ? Shorn . James Shelvill No ! Amy . Amy Giltwood Pray , Mr. Shorn  --  Shorn . James Shelvill Interrupting her You waste your words . Amy . Amy Giltwood Kneeling Heaven knows , such service is its own ; yet here , upon my knees , I beg you to relent ! Giltwood rushes from the closet Oh ! I am lost ! Gilt .

Shorn . James Shelvill I swore to do it to yourself . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Ay ! you hit upon a man at last , too honest to conceal your loathsome secrets . You have made deceit the practice of your life , until the world seems tinged to you with your own baseness ! Footnote : 1kb Amy . Amy Giltwood Listen , Edward , listen !

The sound of your voice offends my ears . Footnote : 1kb Amy . Amy Giltwood You judge , not only without mercy , but without trial . Is this just , Edward ? Gilt . Edward Giltwood Have I not heard enough ? Your crime , under the rigor of the ancient law , would have exposed you to the populace . Such things as you , were in the old days stoned to death beyond the city 's walls . Amy . Amy Giltwood Has Mr. Shorn told you all ? Shorn . James Shelvill All . Gilt . Edward Giltwood All ! ay , he made excuses for you , madam ;  --  Talked of your pride in me , your love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moralists who make one virtue the excuse for a thousand vices .

James Shelvill Yes , indeed I would . Amy . Amy Giltwood Heaven be as merciful to you as you have been to me ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood I knew he would ; he is so soft of heart ; but I am flint . Oh ! you might talk yourself to death , upon this theme , and I would never relent . By Jove ! it amazes me , to see you stand so long beneath my eye , and not dry up to dust ! Madam , your impudence keeps at full pace with your crime . Amy . Amy Giltwood And it amazes me , to see you so very passionate about a crime of which , as Mr. Shorn has told you , I am quite innocent . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Innocent perforce . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is black white ? or can you make it so , to my sight , by persisting in it ?

Edward Giltwood Touch me not , or I shall forget my manhood . Begone ! your touch would defile a leper ! Shorn . James Shelvill Go , madam , go ! You can not help yourself by staying here . Time may do much . Apart to her Edward will feel the loss of you , and then  --  Gilt . Edward Giltwood Interrupting him Promise her nothing . If her sobs and tears move you to pity , or you breathe a hope of our reunion , in the sight of Heaven , I 'll curse you . Footnote : 1kb Shorn . James Shelvill Might I but say a word in her behalf ?

Lest you should think my humility beneath me , it is not for your sake , alone , I ask it . A mother 's heart cries through my lowly prayer . What will our young and helpless children do when I am far away ? Whose hand shall smooth their pillows ; or allay our little sufferers ' agonies when sickness withers them ? Whose hand shall join their rosy palms in prayer to the great power whom we so much offend ? And if Heaven 's wisdom should remove them hence , as it has done with one before their time  --  the child we buried in the spring , my husband ; among the violets and early flowers , dropped like a severed bud  --  oh ! then , what hand would not desecrate the dead , if it performed those offices of love which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . I only ask to live beside my children . I promise you , I will not vex your thoughts , by keeping my poor person in your sight . Gilt . Edward Giltwood Your female eloquence is lost on me . I prepared myself for these tricks of the tongue . Amy . Amy Giltwood Edward , you are not yourself . I know that trade has hardened you , day by day , and that the absorbing lust of gain has slowly usurped the place in your heart which belongs to your family by right ; but I never thought that you would so far forget your better nature , as to resist a plea such as this , even from the lips of a stranger . I am not weeping to make you pity me . I do not wish to soften you by any but rational means . These tears are shed over the disgrace which is about to fall upon our children . You have no right to forget them in your passion . You have no right  --  Oh ! Edward , if my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrow , my silence does not prove my cause unjust . Weeps Gilt . Edward Giltwood Have you done ? Amy . Amy Giltwood Never ! While I can speak , I will raise my voice for my children  --  our children , Edward ; and when my utterance fail me , nature shall echo me , in the stillness of your bosom , with tenfold power . You will regret this . I am of little value in your thoughts , perhaps ; but when I am gone , there will be an empty chair ever before you , a familiar voice lost from your house ; and in the dead of night , you 'll stretch your arms out , in forgetful sleep , and start awake to find me gone . Better for you if I were dead  --  oh ! would to Heaven I were ! Gilt . Edward Giltwood Amen . Amy . Amy Giltwood Oh ! misery ! Grief has quite worn me out .

I will do all that duty , and such love as never entered in your callous heart , can do for Nelly 's memory . Never , if you have any sense of shame , never dare meet me by that little grave ! Gilt .
