The Past , Present , and Future of Atlantic Ocean Steam Navigation . By T. T. VERNON SMInI , C. E. Fredericton , N. B. 185T . IN the Memorial of the Boston Board of Trade , addressed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive statement of facts is given , which will suitably introduce what we desire to say upon the general subject of ocean steam navigation . " The undersigned respectfully submit for your consideration , - " That , prior to the application of STEAM to ocean navigation , the trade of the Atlantic was very largely , if not almost exclusively , in the hands of the citizens of the United States , to whom it yielded valuable returns ; while the vessels employed in it were the admiration of all at the various ports to which they went , and everywhere reflected credit upon the national flag ; " That within the last twenty years a change has been steadily progressing , which has at length resulted in the transfer from sailing vessels to steamships of the entire passenger traffic and nearly all the freight between the United States and Europe ; " That during this period several steamship lines have been established by citizens of the United States ; but , for reasons which the undersigned will not now detail , all these have , after longer or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not one American steamship in the merchant service crossing the Atlantic Ocean ; // " That the change already referred to , of the commerce of the Atlantic from sailing ships to steamers , has thus issued in the complete diversion of this commerce from American to European bottoms ; that we are at the present time totally dependent upon foreign flags for the transportation of our citizens , our correspondence , and our merchandise to and from every foreign country ( excepting Cuba and Panama ) upon the globe ; and that consequently all moneys earned by the conveyance of such passengers , mails , and freight are remitted or are retained abroad ; thus diminishing our national importance with the people of other nations , and draining our resources at home ; " That foreign , and especially British , steamship companies , with the assistance of government grants , and also aided by local facilities for the economical construction of the requisite hulls and machinery , have rendered it difficult , by the occupation of our routes , and by their connections at our principal cities , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their accumulation of profits in the trade now monopolized by them , the difficulty of attempting competition with these companies is increasing daily . " This twofold change which has taken place in the trade of the North Atlantic since the application of steam , namely , the transfer of both freight and passengers from sailing ships to steamers , and from American to European bottoms , is to be traced also upon the other oceans of the globe ; but nowhere as upon this has the development of steamship navigation been so entirely at the expense of the American mercantile marine . And yet the United States started side by side with Great Britain in the knowledge and in the use of this new and mighty agency ; and indeed , as we shall see , was in the advance in its employment for practical purposes with remunerative success . England , Scotland , and the United States claim respectively for Bell , Symington , and Fulton the merit of first applying steam to the propulsion of vessels . We do not propose to reopen this question , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own candidate ; but whatever may be the difference of opinion upon the general question , it is conceded by all the British authorities that Fulton constructed the first steamboat which made regular trips for the accommodation of passengers , and the first which compensated her owners . In 1807 , the Clermont made her appearance on // the Hudson , and in the following year began to ply regularly between New York and Albany . When , in 1813 , the Comet started on the Clyde , there were six steamers on the Hudson and one on the St. Lawrence . It is admitted also that the pioneer steam-vessel to venture out upon the open ocean was under American guidance . Fulton having secured to himself the exclusive privilege of navigating by steam in the waters of the State of New York , Stevens of iloboken , who had brought his experiments to a successful issue almost as soon , took his vessel round by sea to the Delaware , in 1808 . British North America is a competitor with the United States for the honor of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1818 , the Savannah , of 350 tons and 90 horsepower , built in New York , proceeded to Savannah , where she was owned ; she next went to Charleston , and thence , on the 25th of May , 1819 , sailed for Liverpool , where she arrived in safety after a passage of twenty-two days . In reference to this voyage the Canadians urge that the Savannah could hardly be called a steamship , because her paddle-wheels were so arranged that they could be removed and present no impediment to her sailing powers ; that , after steaming a few days , her paddle-wheels were unshipped and taken on deck , the remainder of the distance being performed under canvas ; and that the voyage back was never attempted . But while we concede that these considerations are not without weight , it seems to us that the Savannah must still be regarded as having in an important sense solved the problem of ocean steam navigation , and sufficiently demonstrated its practicability . In 1833 , the Royal William , of 1000 tons burden and 180 horse-power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voyage from Pictou , Nova Scotia , to Cowes , in the Isle of Wight ; it is for her that our Provincial neighbors claim the credit of the first ocean transit by steam . She was employed for three or four years between England and Ireland , and afterwards made several passages across the Atlantic . But the true pioneers in ocean steam navigation were the Sirius and the Great Western , which , in 1838 , ran that exciting race , once and again , to New York and back to England , which initiated and gave the moving impulse to all subsequent // enterprises of the kind . We well remember seeing the Sirius at her moorings in the Thames after her first return from the New World ; among the various craft lying around her , she looked like a giant among pygmies , or , as Sir Francis Head has since expressed it in the title of his interesting description of the Great Eastern , like " a Triton among the minnows . " She had made the passage from London to New York in seventeen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course the full significance of her achievement was not then understood ; but she was for the time one of the prominent wonders of the metropolis . She was of Th0 tons , 320 horse-power , and comely in her proportions . Little did those imagine who then looked upon her with so much admiration , that just opposite to where she then lay at anchor , at Millwall , the keel of a steamship would within twenty years be laid , more than three times the length of the Sirius , and nine times her indicated horse-power . The Sirius had been built to run between London and Cork , but the British and American Steam Navigation Company , resolving not to be left astern by the company in Bristol which was getting the Great Western ready for sea , chartered her to run against this vessel on the ocean , and she made two voyages in their employ . The result of the experiment was so satisfactory , that the London Company placed the British Queen . * and the President upon the route . The Great Western was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her first passage to the westward was accomplished in fifteen days , and the return in thirteen and a half ; on her second trip from New York she reached Bristol in twelve and a half days , which would be considered fair time even now . She continued to sail from the Severii , and subsequently from the Mersey , and made seventy-four Transatlantic passages before passing into the hands of the West India Company . In the mean time the Royal William , already referred to , and the Liverpool , had been despatched by different parties from Liverpool to New York ; so that four independent companies had now entered upon this new arena of commercial enterprise . As is too often the case , however , with those who are the first to undertake new movements of magnitude and risk , no one of these companies succeeded in permanently maintaiiiing itself . // In the same eventful year , the British government advertised for tenders to carry the mails between Liverpool , Halifax , and Boston . Only two bids were made ; and the contract was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years been interested in a line of fast-sailing brigs carrying the mails between Falmouth ( England ) , Halifax , and we believe Boston . Mr. Cunard associated with himself Messrs . George and James Burns of Glasgow , and Messrs . David and Charles McIver of Liverpool , merchants of recognized ability and of large experience . Thus came into existence the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company , the history of which we shall presently have occasion to refer to somewhat in detail . The Unicorn was despatched from Liverpool on the 15th of May , 1840 , to be placed on the branch route to Newfoundland , and made the passage to Boston in nineteen days . She was followed on the 4th of July by the Britannia , the first regular vessel of the Cunard line , under command of Lieut . Woodruff of the Royal Navy , which arrived at Boston in fourteen days eight hours , bringing " one month 's later news from Europe . " In the same year a contract was made by the Admiralty with the Royal Mail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Southampton , the West Indies , and the ports of Mexico on the Gulf , and the first vessel in this service ( which happened to be named the Forth ) took her departure on the 7th of December , 1841 . The contract originally included some of the Southern ports in the United States , but these after a few years were abandoned . In 1845 a contract was concluded with the Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Company ( incorporated in 1840 ) , for the employment of steamers from Southampton via Gibraltar and Malta to Alexandria in Egypt , thence for the transmission of the mails overland to Suez , and thence again by steamers to Aden , Point de Galle , and Calcutta , with branch lines to Bombay , and to Singapore and Hong Kong . When these three great lines were organized , Great Britain had , though unconsciously , more nearly than ever before attained to the sovereignty of the seas ; for the Atlantic , the Mediterranean , the old Erythra*an , and the waters of the East had then been taken possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ac // commodation of her commerce , as though they had all been included within her rightful domain . While the British government was thus seconding and sup-. porting British enterprise on the sea , the subject of ocean steam navigation awakened but little interest in the United States . The requirements of our lakes and rivers for suitable steam tonnage , and the vast extent of the railway system to be developed on the continent , interfered with the due consideration of the claims of the ocean. * Mr. Thomas Butler King of Georgia , who was for many years Chairman of the Committee of the House of Representatives on Naval Affairs , was one of the few statesmen in our country who comprehended the policy of Great Britain in this respect , and who appreciated the importance of similar activity on our part . As early as 1841 , he introduced a resolution directing the Secretary of the Navy to advertise for proposals for mail steamships to run to some of the European ports , and also for a coastwise line between the North and the South . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in 1845 a bill was passed placing the arrangements for the traiisportation of the mails to foreign countries under the direction of the Postmaster-General , and authorizing him to solicit proposals for several routes . This led to the formation of the Ocean Steam Navigation Company of New York , which in 1847 built the Washington of 1,700 tons , and the Hermaun of 1,800 tons , and placed them on the route to Southampton and Bremen . These vessels received a moderate subsidy from the government , and proved themselves safe and reliable ; their average passages to and from Cowes were about fourteen days . Mr. Stuart says of them : " They were at the , time of their construction the best specimens of sea steamers our constructors and engineers had produced , but they proved entirely unequal to the early vessels of the English lines , and far behind , in point of speed , the later Cunarders. " un 1848 , Fox * On the 30th of June , 1861 , the steam tonnage of the United States was 877,203 tons , of which 774,595 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same year , the steam tonnage of Great Britain was 561,023 . On the 1st of Jannary , 1864 , the total length of the railways of the United States was 33 , s30 miles ; that of the United Kingdom , 11,904. // and Livingston established a line to llavre , with the Franklin of 2,400 tons , which was followed by the Humboldt of 2,850 tons ; these steamers made the passage to and from llavre , on the average , in thirteen days . In this year also , the lines between New York and San Francisco via the isthmus of Panama were organized ; and , as it proved , most opportunely , for the discovery of gold in California led to an emigration which at once made them a public necessity , and gave them a strong position apart from the assistance of the government , which of itself would have been altogether inadequate for their support . The California , the Panama , and the Sonora , of the Aspinwall line , and the Illinois and the Empire City , of the Law line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded by a fleet of powerful steamers , which have yielded large profits to their owners , although the public has had much cause for complaint in the manner of their management . We come now , in the order of events , to the Collins line , which went into full operation in the summer of 1850 . At that time the British steamship companies were those already named , with the addition of the Pacific Steam Navigation Company , on the route between Paiiama and Yalparaiso , the contract with which was made in 1845 , and in which , we ought to add , Mr. Wheelwright , an American merchant , was one of the prime movers . Cunard 's was , in 1850 , the only British line coming to the United States ; but it had enlarged its vessels from the Britannia of 1,200 tons , to the Asia of 2,100 tons , and it had doubled the service , by making the same number of trips , since 1848 , to New York as to Boston . Our coastwise lines , both on the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were now placed upon a permanent footing , and with the Collins vessels the number of trips across the Atlantic , under the American flag , was to be fully equal to those under the cross of St. George . Notwithstanding the partial apathy of the past , it seemed as though we had almost overtaken our rival upon the seas , and might soon outstrip her . Mr. Senator Gwin spoke with a natural enthusiasm , but prematurely , when he said of the new steamers , just after they had entered upon their career : " Their success has elevated the American name and character ; it has wrested // Oct. from Great Britain the palm of the maritime dominion , and merits such a substantial recognition by the American government as will indicate that the contest is a national one upon both sides , and not a strife between an association of American citizens and the greatest governmental power of the world . " Mr. Collins 's first proposition to the government of the United States was made in 1845 , but no contract was concluded until 1847 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessels ready for sea , owing to various changes in the machinery which from time to time were determined upon , and to other causes . The Atlantic first took her departure for Europe in April , 1850 ; the Pacific followed in a few weeks , and the Arctic and the Baltic soon after . These vessels were almost alike in model and in dimensions . The following figures give the size of the Arctic : - Length of main deck 282 feet . Breadth of beam 45 " Depth under main deck , 24 Depth under spar deck , 32 Tonnage 2856 tons . Cylinder 95 inches . Stroke , 10 feet . These magnificent vessels at once took the first position upon the ocean ; their models were superior in grace and proportion to anything that had been seen ; they combined the sharpness and symmetry of our swift river steamers with the beauty and buoyancy of our world-renowned sailing-packets . The London Times spoke with admiration of the appearance of the Arctic as she steamed up the Mersey , opening the water before her so smoothly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their speed brought Europe and America more than a day nearer together ; and the comfort and elegance of their accommodations were unequalled . It is not strange that much pride in them was manifested throughout the country , for the future which awaited them was full of brilliant promise ; and although this promise was unfulfilled , it can not be doubted that they introduced a new era in the navigation of the ocean . In anticipation of their appearance , the Cunard Company had built the Asia and the Africa ; these vessels being unequal to the competition , // the Arabia was brought out , but the Arctic was more than a match for her . For what first-class ocean steamships are to-day , the public is largely indebted to the genius and enterprise of Mr. Collins and his associates . The testimony of an officer of the British navy , who made a passage in the Baltic in 1852 , will be valuable in this connection. * " I am only doing justice to these magnificent vessels in stating that they are , beyond any competition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world . I am sorry to be obliged to say this , but as a naval officer I feel bound in candor to admit their great superiority . Their extraordinary easiness in a sea can not fail to excite the admiration of a sailor , and I never beheld anything like it . There was none of that violent plunging , that sudden check , usually attending a large ship in a heavy head-sea . The elongated bow dipped gently in when a vast wall-sided and threatening swell appeared overwhelmingly to rush upon her . The whole fore-length of the vessel appeared to sink gently down until almost level with the water , and ns gradually to rise again after passing . Most wondrous of all , no sea ever came on board , and the foaming and angry waters appeared to glide harmlessly past her peak and narrow bows . The extraordinary difference in this respect to the America was most marked , as a very ordinary head-sea would dash angrily and with huge volumes over her bows . " He goes on to attribute this superiority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the lightness and buoyancy of the fore part of the vessel when relieved from the bowsprit . He adds : - " From a considerable experience in all classes of steam-vessels besides the Cunard America , I advisedly assert that the Baltic is out and out , by long odds , the very best and easiest steamship I ever sailed in . " These steamers were very successful in drawing passengers , and yet it is doubtful if they ever secured the full confidence of the public to the same exteiit as the Cunard ships . While they bore away the palm for excellence of model , for speed and for convenience of passenger accommodations , there was something wanting in their machinery which gave an important advantage to their less showy but eminently stanch and steady // Oct. rivals . We were told by experienced English commanders who saw them on the stocks , that nothing could be better than the material of their hulls or the manner of their construction . The Atlantic and the Baltic , now owned by the Pacific Mail Steamship Company , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years past , and are in as good condition as ever . But the engines , although beautiful in their finish , were not altogether reliable at first ; probably there was no such deficiency in them as endangered the vessels , but frequent mishaps , many of them slight in themselves , tended to impair confidence , and added seriously to current expenses . It is important to inquire carefully into the causes of the failure and abandonment of the Collins enterprise . No one can now be injured , while great public advantage may accrue from telling the plain truth on this subject . If we would not fail in new attempts to promote ocean-steamship interests under our flag , we must distinctly comprehend the reasons why the efforts of the past have been so unfortunate . The first of these causes was fundamental . From the start , the Company appears to have suffered for the want of the requisite capital . It was stated during the debates in Congress in 1855 , and the statement was not controverted , that up to that time , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its capital paid in amounted only to $1,200,000 . It began , therefore , with a cumbrous debt of $ 1,744,142 , which was secured by mortgages , and which made a continual drain for interest and commissions . But with careful management this difficulty might have been overcome , for its receipts from the government for the transportation of the mails during the first five years amounted to $ 3,413,966 , or considerably more than the cost of its vessels. * Its receipts also from other sources were * Mr. Collins submitted the following curious statement to Congress , dated February 17th , 1855 : - Total receipts for passengers and freight , . . $ 4,460,867 " " " mail service 3,413,966 $ 7,874,833 Total disbursements 7,207,291 $667,542 This nominal surplus he more than disposed of as follows - // large , and when the Arctic and the Pacific were lost , they were insured f* their value at the time . The inadequacy of capital at the outset was aggravated by the extravagant cost of the vessels , and the lavish expenditure continually made upon them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to have been $736,035 ; which exceeded by $150,000 the cost of the Asia and the Africa , the most expensive ships with which they then had to compete . The luxurious elegance of the saloons and cabins , * which were compared by a Senator to Cleopatra 's barge , was altogether unnecessary . The passenger accommodations of the English line might have been improved upon without going to such an extreme in style and show . Comfort , not elegance , is what is required at sea ; neatness and solidity are much more appropriate than elaborate decoration . The machinery also , deficient as it was to a certain extent , cost more than enough to be equal to the best . Expensive alterations were made after the specifications were drawn up , and , indeed , after the engines were partially constructed ; and novelties , which were supposed to be improvements , were introduced , which after trial had to be given up . These vessels , thus expensively built , were still more expensively sailed . According to sworn statements laid before Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the average receipts for the same were $48,286 ; which would leave a deficit at the end of the year of $440,154 , or more than half the cost of one of the vessels . This sum included repairs and insurance ; but did not allow for depreciation from wear and tear , or for interest on the investment . To offset this deficit , however , the company received a subsidy from the government , which , according to the service performed , was much more than was ever paid to the Cunard Company . But this subsidy helped to provoke its ruin . The managing owners seem to have acted upon the presumption that they had the national treasury to fall back upon , and that Loss of the Arctic $255,000 Depreciation of investment , . . 258,000 7 per ct . interest on capital , . . 408,000 $921,000 // therefore prudence and economy were unnecessary . Mr. John Austin Stevens , Jr. , in the able Memorial of the O*amber of Commerce of the State of New York prepared by him , is obliged to say : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the management of this line there was wanting that regard to economy which is essential to success in enterprises of this nature . " It must be admitted that the desire to surpass rivals , and to achieve distinction for this great representative line , proceeded largely from national and patriotic motives ; but while acquitting those concerned of unworthy or dishonorable motives , we consider the principle on which they acted to be unsound and dangerous . Whenever a corporation or an individual engages in business for the sake of notoriety rather than for substantial success , the result will almost always be disastrous . Reputation , if deserved , will come in good time , but it should not be sought for as a direct object . Had the ships of which we are speaking been managed on strict commercial principles , the issue would perhaps have been altogether different . But a recklessness in another particular also characterized the management of the Collins line . The all-controlling desire for pre-eminence , which seemed te outweigh every consideration of prudence , manifested itself principally in reference to speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to outsail the British steamers , if it were necessary to put all the capital at risk in order to do it . The speeches in Congress by the advocates of the line were full of the same spirit . We think the people of the United States , if not the government also , were greatly to blame on this point , and the responsibility for the result must rest in part with them . The Hon. Mr. Olds of Ohio , in a speech in the House of Representatives , expressed the feeling of multitudes in the country , when he said : " We have the fastest horses , the prettiest women , and the best shooting guns in the world , and we must also have the fastest steamers . The Collins steamers must beat the British steamers . Our people expected this of Mr. Collins , and he has not disappointed them . " Government had not stipulated in the contract for a given rate of speed , only that the vessels were to be " of great speed " ; but Mr. Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he // probably felt that the honor of the country depended upon his beating his competitors on every trip . One gentleman , in the Senate , intimated that the friends of free government throughout the world were watching the contest between Collins and Cunard with the intensest interest . The vast importance which is made to attach to fast passages in Mr. Stuart 's " Naval and Mail Steamers , " and by Mr. Stevens in his " Memorial , " indicates what this question of speed was in the public estimation ; and we fear it is still thought of too much . There is little doubt that the Collins vessels could have kept in advance of all others , without the extreme effort which they put forth from the beginning ; they had every advantage in their model , and their power might have been cautiously and gradually increased , under favorable circumstances , so as to secure the shortest time practicable between the Old World and the New . Mr. Collins Wtimated that the small difference of about one day which he gained over the Cunard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * and in this way : - 400 tons of coal @ $7 $ 2,800 200 " freight from Liverpool @ $30 , . . . 6,000 200 " " to " @$15 , . . . 3,000 Additional repairs to engines , not estimating the wear and tear of ship and machinery , . . . 5,000 $ 16,800 These figures seem to us excessive , except the cost of the coal ; but Mr. Collins was ready to come before the country and declare that lie was sacrificing $5 436,800 annually for the sake of saving a few hours in the transit across the Atlantic , and the country encouraged him in his course . Had the emulation been in respect of economy in sailing , perfection of discipline , solid comfort in cabin arrangements , or anything but speed , the rivalry might have been advantageous . As it was , the struggle involved the company in constantly increasing financial embarrassment , and cost two splendid steamships , with hundreds of lives . // This expensive and reckless navigation was performed on an ocean perhaps the most dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the severity and frequency of its gales . Time and experience might possibly have led to the correction of the other evils to which we have referred , although we confess the indications were unfavorable ; but this infatuation on the subject of speed was to lead to disasters to this favorite and boasted line from which it could not recover . On the 20th of September , 1854 , the Arctic , the pride of the nation , the clipper of the seas , with everything auspicious about her , sailed from Liverpool on what promised to be a mere pleasuretrip across a summer sea . She was thronged with passengers , and the interests of many a home circle on both sides of the Atlantic were involved in the issue of that passage . She was making unwonted progress day after day , and , ensnaring hope , she was to reach New York in the shortest time on record from Liverpool . With such eagernes* in the race , would that there had been a corresponding use of precaution in that swift advance through the dense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubled on the forecastle and tbe fore-. top , and that sufficient apprehension of danger had been felt to induce preparation for its appearance ; but all thought themselves secure . At noon on Wednesday , the 27th , the Captain had announced the splendid run of the twenty-four hours previous , and the passengers were seating themselves at lunch , making bets upon the number of hours which it would take to reach New York , and talking in terms of praise and pride of the noble vessel , matchless in elegance , in speed , yes , in all but in safety . For at that very moment there was a crash , and an alarm , and a stoppage of the engines ; the only vessel within perhaps a hundred miles at the time had suddenly emerged from the fog , and plunged her sharp stem into the Arctic 's bows , as a swordfish might wound a whale ; it was the French steamer Vesta , a tiny craft compared with the Arctic , but able to inflict a mortal blow . In the mysterious ordering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instant when the Arctic , just rising on the . swell , exposed herself to peril where she was most vulnerable . Even then , however , there was no thought of danger , except for the Vesta , which // had left her prow fastened between the timbers of the Arctic 's frame , and offers of assistance were made to her which she declined . Three cheers were given from the deck of the ill-fated steamship when assurances were received that the Vesta was not seriously disabled , and the vessels parted , each to pursue her way . In the mean time the sea was pouring into the Arctic below the water-line , and it soon became apparent that she was settling at the bows . Brave efforts were now made for safety , but the delay had been too great , and there was no hope except in leaving the vessel . The order was soon given to man and lower the boats ; this was the signal for general confusion , and for the extinction of all authority on board . We do not wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Captain , who worked gallantly for the salvation of the precious lives depending upon him , and who took no thought for himself ; but there was an utter absence of discipline in this awful emergency , and some of the officers and most of the crew , throwing off all restraint , sought only to save themselves . Then was beheld the shameful sight of boats half filled with strong men pushing away from the vessel on whose deck a hundred women and children were standing helpless and doomed . We need not dwell on the sickening details ; three hundred and twenty-two lives were lost , and not a woman or child escaped , although some of them had friends who would have given a boat-load of treasure to secure for them places which were vacant , and which they might and should have had freely . We shall never forget how , a few days afterwards , it was shouted in our hearing , as we approached the wharf at Halifax in the Europa , which had brought us almost over the very scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some of the survivors had just arrived there , and the electric wires were even then trembling with the sad intelligence which on that morning was to thrill numberless hearts with anguish . From that collision shock of the Xfesta , the Collins Company never recovered . The contract with the government contemplated the construction of five vessels , and before the loss of the Arctic the Adriatic had been commenced . This steamship surpassed in size and in power , not only the other ships of the Collins line , // but every vessel then afloat . She was of 4,144 tons , and no pains had been spared to make her all that a first-class mail steamship ought to be . But unfortunately there was , in reference to her , the same looseness of calculation that was exhibited in the other vessels . It was inexcusable to undertake the construction of a vessel , expecting to spend $ 900,000 upon her , and find when she was completed that her cost had reached nearly $1,200,000 . Nor was it prudent for a company with its position only partially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no certainty of permanent support from the government , to embark so large a sum in the construction of a single vessel . The Scotia , since built by the Canard Company , cost about $ 900,000 ; but she was the fifteenth paddle-wheel steamship which they had brought upon the route , and when they had gained the experience of more than twenty years . Mr. Collins and his associates were too impatient and too fast ; they sought to accomplish , almost at the very outset , what it had required long years of patient , plodding perseverance for the Cunard Company to perform . To be sure , it was not needful for them to go over the entire ground traversed by their predecessors ; but practical experience in ocean steam navigation , not less certainly than in other departments of industry , both individuals and companies must gain for themselves ; and they must allow time for its growth , for it is not " the hasty product of a day . " That the Adriatic , when completed , was peerless in her proportions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag , she is recognized as one of the finest steamships in the world , but poorly compensates for the national mortification involved in the failure of the great American company to which she belonged ; or , what is of far more importance , for the discouraging effcct this failure has had upon subsequent projects in the same direction . Before the Adriatic was ready for sea , the Company was overtaken by another disaster , in some respects more appalling than the wreck of the Arctic , although attended with less loss of life . The winter of 1855-56 had been unusually severe both on the land arid on the sea , and one effect of the gales had been to break up the great ice-fields of the frozemi North , // and to fill the Atlantic with ice at a season when it is rarely met with in these latitudes . On the 23d of *January , 1856 , the Pacific , not fully advised , perhaps , of this state of things , left the Mersey for New York , and was never heard of afterwards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice which then barricaded the passage between the two hemispheres , and that the calamity was sudden and brief . That she too , like the Arctic , was endangered by ambition for speed , if not lost absolutely in consequence , is to be feared from the circumstance that the new steamship Persia was to follow three days later on her first voyage ; the comparative merits of the rival vessels had been freely canvassed on Change and at the hotels in Liverpool , and the Pacific started with the determination not to be beaten . This dangerous spirit of emulation was not confined , however , to her . Mr. Vernon Smith admits this in his interesting allusion to the occurrence , and we shall venture to quote his remarks in full . " Three days after her the Pacific , the Persia , new from her builders ' hands , rushed after her in a race second to none that had yet made the Atlantic their pacing ground . America had for some time beaten us in the contest for speed ; our vessels , built for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been sacrificed in their construction to a fancied security against attack , to a possible chance of other service than the requirements of commerce , and their details had been dictated and superintended by the naval authorities of the day. * In 1854 , the Arabia , the last of the Cunard vessels built of wood , had separately beaten each of the Collins steamers in succession , but the average speed for the year was in favor of the Collins line . In 1855 , the requirements of the Crimean war had withdrawn the Arabia from the station , had disarranged the mail service , and left the Collins line without any competitors on the iNew York route . The commencement of the next year set all the old boats at liberty , the line to New York was resumed , and in addition to the Arabia , the Persia was making ready for the start . For the first time , a steamer combining unusual power and size with a symmetry of proportion and beauty of model unequalled by * Mr. Smith overlooks the fact that the Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view to the possibilities of government service . Commodore Perry , in a letter to the Secretary of the Navy , dated February 15 , 1852 , gave it as his opinion , " that $ 20,000 expended on each would convert them into war-steamers at any of our navy-yards . " Except for the transport service , however , the vessels of both lines would as war-steamers disappoint the expectations of their projectors. // anything afloat had been permitted to take her place in the mail service untrammelled by naval inspection , and built of a material against which the Admiralty had passed a final and decisive verdict . " Under these circumstances Captain Eldredge succeeded Nye in the command of the Pacific , and , with the avowed intention of challenging her rival before mooring at New York , the Persia sped after her on her first Atlantic journey . Five days out from Liverpool , the Persia , running eleven knots an hour , struck heavily on a field of ice . For the first time that such an accident , though often threatened , had actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one of the number that could have survived the shock . The collision broke a large hole through the plates of her iron bow , tore the rivets asunder for sixteen feet on her starboard side , and bent and twisted the rims of her paddle-wheels as if they had been made of lead . No woodea vessel could have lived an hour after receiving that terrible blow . The first compartment instantly filled , but the water-tight bulkhead saved her , and though laden down with the weight of water in her bows , and sailing heavily by the head , she was enabled slowly to keep on her course , and reached New York in safety , though much behind the anticipated time . And where was the Pacific ? Seven days after the accident to the Persia , and near the same place , the Edinburgh , on her passage from Glasgow to New York , picked up some cabin furniture , a lady 's work-box , and a few trivial articles , in the position that ten days before had probably been occupied by the missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of the unfortunate liner . Independently of the accident to the Persia and the report of the Edinburgh , the Atlantic on the 19th of February , the Arago on the 22d , and the Africa on the 2d of March , were all in imminent danger from the same cause , and near the same place , and on their homeward trip the Baltic and the Arabia both encountered the opposite shore of the same floating island whose eastern edge had proved so fatal to the Pacific , and so dangerous to the others. * ' It was long before the public could bring itself to believe that the Pacific was lost . Week after week the suspense became more painful , but the Atlantic had been missing in the winter of 1851 , and after a long agony the joyful news had reached us that she was safe in Liverpool , having put back in a disabled condition after making half the distance to New York . " Why may it not be the same with the Pacific ? It can not be that two out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a period of eighteen months . " Thus // men talked , " hoping against hope , " but the steamers sent in search of the overdue vessel returned without tidings ; successive arrivals from Europe failed to bring the hoped-for intelligence ; and at length the Pacific was placed on that dreary list of " missing vessels " of which nothing more will ever be known until the sea gives up its dead and reveals all the awful mysteries buried with them . Until the completion of the Adriatic , the company chartered the Ericsson and the Quaker City to make out the required service ; but the trips were irregular and unsatisfactory , the confidence of the community was almost destroyed , and the successful passages of the Adriatic , when at length she made her appearance , were not sufficient to dissipate the general distrust , or to remove the pressure under which the company labored . In this state of things Congress discontinued the extra compensation voted *in 1852 ; and , as the company was hopelessly insolvent before , this hastened its inevitable suspension . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge it with breach of faith , as well as with a disregard to the national interests . This is most unjust , and evinces a want of discrimination which can only injure the steamship cause with our public men . A careful reference to the action of Congress on this subject , will show that the Collins Company had no reason whatever to complain of the treatment it received at the hands of the government . In 1847 , Mr. Collins , in behalf of himself and others , entered into a contract for the conveyance of the mails between New York and Liverpool , agreeing to make twenty voyages each year , and to employ five vessels " of great speed , and sufficiently strong for war-vessels , " which were to be ready for sea in eighteen or twenty months . Mr. Collins named his own terms , and they were acceded to , $19,250 a voyage . As the stipulated time drew near , Congress was memorialized to extend the limit for the completion of the vessels , and it consented . It was then asked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel , from the date of launching until the sum should reach $ 385,000 , equal to one years ' conpensation. under the contract ; this was in effect asking it to supply so much capital ; but the money was voted . Mr. Collins now desired to be relieved from his obligation to // employ four midshipmen of the United States navy on each of his vessels ; this also was conceded . His next request was that the construction of the fifth vessel might be postponed ; and this was granted . In 1852 , the Post-Office Department having expressed a wish to increase the number of voyages per annum from twenty to twenty-six ; the opportunity was taken to ask that the compensation for each voyage might be advanced from $19,250 to $ 33,000 . So that , instead of an annual subsidy of $ 385,000 for twenty voyages , the amount should be $858,000 for twenty-six voyages . Congress thus far had been very patient , but this demand was almost too much for its liberality , seeing that Mr. Collins had made the original contract upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a higher rate of compensation than the Cunard Company . But it was urged in his behalf , that , during the two years which had transpired , he had been gaining experience at *a heavy cost in a new field of enterprise ; and that the disaster to the Atlantic , when she broke her shaft and returned to Liverpool , cost him $100,000 . The expense involved in maintaining the reputation of the vessels for speed was insisted upon , and the figures were presented which w* have already given . It was more than intimated that this heavy additional compensation would in all probability be only needed for a short time ; and after much discussion the measure was carried , with a proviso that six months ' notice of discontinuance of the extra grant ( $13,750 a voyage ) might be given by Congress after the close of 1854 . In 1855 , a persistent endeavor was made to secure the repeal of this proviso , and to make an unconditional contract at $858,000 annually for five years ; Congress , however , refused to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Collins and his friends were pushing matters too far for their own interest ; each new demand was more excessive than the last , and yet the affairs of the company were becoming more involved than before . It is no wonder that , after their second great disaster , when they had only two vessels for a service which they had contracted to perform with five , and when of necessity they were irregular in their trips and behindhand in time , Congress should vote to discontiimue the concession of 1852 , which was granted with the understanding that // it was to be temporary , and should restrict the company to $19,250 a voyage , as originally agreed upon . It should be mentioned , also , that in 1855 , when the Cunard vessels were withdrawn from the New York route , Mr. Vanderbilt had proposed to supply their place with a semi-monthly line , to alternate with the Collins ships , and had asked $15,000 if he might confine himself to the average speed of the Cunard line , or $ 19,250 if he were expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done . After the suspension of the coinpany , its friends came to Washington once more , and asked for permission , on resuming the service , to go to Southampton instead of to Liverpool ; but Congress had grown weary of so much importunity . One speaker expressed the feeling of a majority of the members when he said : - " After having suspended the trips for more than a year , after breaking up the contract and denying his indebtedness to the governments and being at this very day indebted to the government in large sums of money for the very building of his ships , he Mr. Collins comes here and asks you to give him additional legislative favors . " Mr. Vanderbilt bad placed one or more steamers on the route to Southampton and Havre , and had again proposed to make a mail contract with the government , his terms being $ 16,680 a voyage , the compensation paid by Great Britain to the Cunard line . We believe also that the Bremen steamers were still running , and to have acceded to Mr. Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to give him a monopoly of which he bad showu himself to be unworthy , and to enable him to run both these lines off the routes which they had occupied with credit to themselves and with security to the community . The Collins Company did not resume its service , &amp;nd soon ceased to exist ; its early history had been promising ; it had been generously sustained by the government ; a nation 's pride had become identified with its prosperity ; it had attracted the attention of the world by the brilliancy of its performances , and not less by the tragic terrors of its misfortunes ; - but errors , fundamental and fatal , had entered into the schej*ne for its establishment and into the method of its administration , - errors which time did not modify , or experience counteract ,  --  and the final disaster could not be averted . // The Cunard Company deserves more particular notice than we have yet given to it . The steamships with which the line was started were of 1200 tons* and 440 horse power ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Columbia . They were an enlargement of , and in some respects an improvement upon , the vessels which Messrs . Burns and Mclver had employed for many years between Glasgow and Liverpool . These had been sea-going steamers in all essential points , adapted for the rough passage of the Irish Sea , and tested by a coastwise service as stormy as is to be found anywhere . The experience gained in this trade was of the greatest importance when deepsea navigation by steam was to be attempted , and contributed not a little to the subsequent success of the new company . The sphere on which they were entering was not altogether new to them ; rather , it was the expansion of one which they had already shown themselves competent to occupy . The ilibernia , which came out in 1842 , although not much larger than her predecessors , was considered an improvement upon them , and the Cambria , of 1400 tons , built in 1846 , was regarded yet more favorably . In 1848 the company , still cautiously feeling its way , added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons , - the America , the Niagara , the Europa , and the Canada . Oii the 1st of January in the same year , the ilibernia sailed from New York , opening the service on that route . In 1850 the Asia and the Africa , again somewhat larger , came into the line . All this time the passages had been gradually shortening , and the Asia , when new , repeatedly reached Boston on the tenth day from Liverpool . Early in 1853 the Arabia made her first trip ; she was of 2400 tons , and attracted much attention . The Persia made her appearance in 1856 , a splendid vessel of 3600 tons , with ample and commodious saloon and state-room accommodations . The model and the general effect of the Collins steamers had evidently been carefully studied and profited by . In one instance the Persia landed her passengers at Liverpool on the ninth day from New York . She , however , has had to give place to a * Jt should be remembered that the tonnage of British vessels appears smaller than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the different modes of measurement prevailing iu the two countries . // newer rival ; the Scotia , of 4100 tons , entered the service in 1862 ; she may be considered as the original fleet of 1840 compressed into one vessel , with every well-tried improvement in addition . She made the run to Liverpool last December in 8 days 21 hours , including the detention off Cork Harbor . All these ships of which we have spoken are paddle-wheel steamers . The company own also two powerful screw-steamships , which take their turn in the mail line ,  --  the Australasian , of 1800 tons , built in 1857 , and the China , of 2500 tons , in 1862 ; these are constructed of iron , as are also the Persia and the Scotia . In this slow and steady progress we discover an important element contributing to the success of the Cunard Company . Never in advance of the times , but never far behind them ; never experimenting , but always ready to adopt any improvement thoroughly tested by others ; avoiding equally extravagance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it is engaged , and so far as pos*ible guarding against every contingency ,  --  the success of this Company , taking all things into the account , has never been equalled . These vessels are plying constantly between Great Britain and the United States ; no gale sweeps the North Atlantic that does not toss at least one of them ; no fog rests on its bosom that does not obscure their path ; no floating berg or ice-field drifts to the southward that does not pass almost immediately athwart their bows . And yet they steam to and fro , during all seasons , amidst all dangers , in spite of all contingencies , with as much regularity as the ferry-boats which cross our harbors ; they come and go , bringing and taking their precious lading , and we have come to consider it all as a matter of course . " Yes , " we have heard it said , " they are certainly very fortunate vessels . " Fortunate ! That is not the word to apply to them ; it is not to good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good management that they owe their success . " Providence helps those who help themselves . " These vessels are not exempt from exposure to casualty , or from extreme peril . They have more than once gone ashore ; they have been on fire ; they have come into collision with ice , with other vessels , and in a single instance with each other ; their // canvas has been torn to shreds ; their decks have been swept ; almost everything has happened to them as to other ships , e*-cept that , so far as we remember , not one of them has ever sprung a leak . But these perils have made their excellence the more apparent . When the Europa cut the Charles Bartlett down to the water 's edge , in 1849 ; when the Persia struck the ice in 1856 ; when the Arabia and the Europa came in collision off Cape Race in 1858 ; when the Africa went ashore in the same vicinity in 1863 , - the strength of the vessels , the discipline of the crews , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment when everything was depending upon them . Then it was seen that the ships were not built for pleasure excursions , and that their officers were not dressed for holiday show . Such occurrences have secured a confidence for them which could not otherwise have been gained ; since it must now be admitted that they have not been especially favored of fortune , but that they have subjected fortune to themselves ; they have not only commanded success , " they have done more , they have deserved it ; " their construction has been proved to be most stanch and thorough ; and all will allow that they have been navigated with a skill equal to any exigency which has yet arisen , and with a watchful care ceaseless and untiring as the revolutions of their own paddlewheels . The Cunard Company has lost one vessel , the Columbia , which drifted ashore on Sable Island in a fog in 1842 , and could not be got off Everything pertaining to the passengers and crew was saved , and whatever was thought worth removal from the vessel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally lost , and many a storm swept on and over this before it broke up and went to pieces . During these four-and-twenty years more than 150,000 passengers have embarked by this line ; occasionally an invalid has died on board , but , so far as the company has been concerned , it has never failed in a single instance to fulfil its agreement with those who have intrusted themselves to its care . When we consider the fatality which has attended other lines , such a record is wonderful . Of the roughness and danger of Atlantic navigation we have already spoken . But in the teeth of the most violent weather , // these stout ships , month in and month out , year in and year out , for more than twenty years , have perseveringly , persistently , triumphantly , pressed against and through all opposition , and attained the determined goal . We can recall but one instance in which the contest had to be abandoned for a tinW . In the autumn of 1856 , in the storm which Sir John Herschel informs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features of the European weather-table under the name of " the November atmospheric wave , " the America , her decks swept , and the houses and bulwarks forward on one side carried away , was obliged to return to Liverpool for repairs . But the good ship sustained no substantial injury , and was soon ready to resume the voyage . The first impression one receives on going on board these ships is of their massive solidity and strength , and the impression is not a deceptive one . In the machinery especially , the best material , the most skilful mechanism , and the most approved designs are made use of ; the engines are always put together and thoroughly tested in motion before going into the vessel . Everything also is kept in the best repair . After a certain number of voyages , the vessels are hauled up , whether they appear to require attention or not . A visitor at one of the company 's works near Glasgow saw several boilers lying about which had been condemned simply because of their age , and not because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was told that , after a boiler has been in use for a specified time , the rule is invariably to remove it . The company do not wait until a boiler explodes before deciding whether it is defective ; nor do they give it the benefit of a doubt . The ships thus sent to sea in the best condition are navigated under strict and thorough discipline , and competent and experienced seamanship . Every captain must have served as first officer in the employ of the company , and every first officer must have been a captain in some other service . The supervision of the Admiralty , and the liability to a searching examination before the Board of Trade in the event of accident , doubtless exert a wholesome influence upon all who are in authority . The pecuniary success of this line has been fully commen // Oct. surate with its prosperity otherwise . From four small steamships it has grown to a fleet of nearly forty vessels , including all its branches . During the Crimean war it was able to supply to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Halifax and Boston . The British government has always been liberal to it , and without such liberality it could hardly have sustained itself in its earlier years ; for the passengers who then gave the preference to steamers were comparatively few , and to suggest the shipment on them of any description of freight excepting the most valuable and of the least bulk , would have been thought absurd . The subsidy has been increased from time to time , but in all instances in consideration of an extension of the service , and of an addition to the size or the number of the vessels employed . There is no question that with the government this is the favorite company of the whole packet service , doubtless because of its long-proved reliability and safety . While the West India Company is compensated at the rate of * 2.46 a mile , and the Peninsular and Oriental Company at the rate of $ 1.53 , the Canard Company receives $ 2.83. * This can not be because the North Atlantic route is less remunerative from its ordinary receipts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we judge , the payment is in part an acknowledgment of the admirable management of the line during all its history ; which influences favorably other and similar lines , and which reflects no little credit upon the British marine . It stands ready to furnish to the government , at short notice , well-ordered and well-equipped steamers , in any exigency ; and its managing owners are constantly called on by the authorities for information and advice on the subjects with which they are known to be familiar . In 1859 , Mr. Cunard , who is conservative in his politics , was made a Baronet by Lord Derby , in recogiiition of what he had accomplished for ocean steam navigation . The present contract will expire on the 1st of January , 1867 , with twelve months ' notice thereafter ; and notwithstanding the good disposition towards the line of both government and people , there will be a strong opposition brought to bear against the // renewal of the subsidy , by the Montreal Company , by the company which Mr. Inman represents , and perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic between the Collins and the *Dunard lines was in progress , and just when the spirit of rivalry had reached its height , the shipbuilders of Great Britain were bringing to perfection a new class of steamers , which were destined to interfere more seriously with the carrying trade of the United States upon this ocean than any that had previously been introduced . We refer to the iron screw steamships , for which the yards and shops on the Clyde especially have become so famous ; and our long neglect of which in this country has been far more fatal to our commercial interests than the hesitation of the Federal government to grant subsidies , of which our citizens so often complain . For , as these vessels have shown themselves able to compete with the British paddle-wheel steamers with their heavy subsidies , they can of course compete with Americaii vessels of the same build , not subsidized at all . They cost less to construct and less to sail than a paddle-wheel steamer , while their capacity for freight and passengers is much greater . The Cunard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 400 or 500 tons of freight , while a screw steamer of the same tonnage , sailing at half the expense , will carry 1,800 tons . These screw steamers have also entered into successful competition with sailing ships , which the other steamers never could do to any serious extent ; and they have come to control the freighting business between this country and Europe . They have solved the long-perplexing problem of self-sustaining ocean steam navigation , having indicated that the degree of speed really demanded by the public necessity can be attained at an outlay which the ordinary rates of freight and passenger traffic will justify . As now constructed , some of them are able to make passages on the average almost , if not quite , as fast as the best paddle-wheel steamers ; and as their model and machinery are improved upon , their speed increases and their running expenses diminish ; so that it is believed , at no distant day , for voyages of moderate length , they will entirely supersede sailing ships for every description of cargo . The freighting history of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of transportation become developed , traffic of every kind avails itself of steam . A few years ago , no one would have supposed that the New York Central Railroad could transport freight to advantage by the side of the Erie Canal ; or that the Grand Trunk Railway of Canada would be able to take away nearly all the business of the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario steamers . But it has been seen that screw propellers only can maintain themselves on parallel routes against railroad competition . The prices at which railroad companies now contract for freight would formerly have been pronounced ruinous ; yet these prices are known to be remunerative . And as steam transportation on the land has shown itself thus to be more than a match for water-carriage , ocean steamers are now discovered to be formidable rivals to sailing ships for ordinary merchandise and for every class of passengers . The coal trade between Newcastle and London furnishes a double illustration on this subject . Formerly the colliers , so called , engaged in this trade , were the . poorest , cheapest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any waters . Anything that could float and move was considered good enough for the transportation of coal . But the Great Northern Railway put on coal trains , and , to the surprise of everybody , was able to take away the business from the colliers . And now , in recent years , iron propellers have entered into competition with the railway , and some of the largest proprietors make use of them altogether for the shipment of their coal to the metropolis . In a single year , 18,000 tons of iron screw colliers were built on the Tyne alone . Some of them are of 1,500 tons burden . It is estimated that in one year a screw collier will convey as many coals as ten of the ordinary vessels could do in the same time . In 1852- 53 the Cunard Company began to use iron propellers as auxiliary to their mail steamers ; the Alps , the Etna , the Jura , * and others , were despatched from Liverpool or llavre to Boston or New York , as occasion required , and this led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become convinced , also , that the screw can be employed in the // mail service as successfully as in freighting . The China alternates with the Persia and the Scotia , and her speed is nearly equal to theirs . She is said to be the least expensive and the most useful vessel belonging to the company . Her daily consumption of coal is about seventy tons , against one hundred and twenty toiis consumed by the Scotia . In 1854 another line was started , under the direction and agency of Mr. William Inman ; the vessels were called after various cities , and Philadelphia was made their destination in the United States . The first year witnessed the loss of the City of Glasgow and the City of Philadelphia ; but the proprietors persevered in their efforts , managing the ships with economy , adapting them to the trade , and carefully increasing their power and capacity . In 1857 they changed from Philadelphia to New York . Notwithstanding its loss of three ships , the line has been a decided success , and has a hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cunard line . It began with a monthly service , but now makes weekly trips , and frequently in busy times two vessels a week are sent to sea . Mr. Inman testified before the Select Committee on Ocean Steamships of the House of Commons , that , up to the advent of the Scotia , the vessels of his line had beaten on the average all the Cunard vessels , and had beaten every vessel separately except the Persia . It is now claimed that the City of New York ( since wrecked in Queenstown Harbor ) made the fastest passage to Liverpool ever accomplished , beating the Scotia by a few hours . What is no less noteworthy , this line , unassisted by the British government , has been able to sustain itself against the subsidized companies . It should be said , however , that the abandonment of the Liverpool route by Mr. Collins gave an impulse to its operations , to which its success since that time is to be more or less attributed . It adopted the Collins sailing days , and , by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the mails which had previously been conveyed by the American ships , for the consideration of the ocean postage accruing upon them . The compensation for this service amounts to about * 200,000 per annum . This line , therefore , like all the British lines on the Atlantic , has been built up largely at our expense . // The trade of the Canadas , which formerly depended upon the St. Lawrence , and which was limited each year to the period of open navigation , now gives employment to several steamship lines , which make Portland their winter harbor . The Canadians have manifested an energy and a forecast in establishing them , which merchants and others on this side of the frontier may imitate advantageously . They have not been blind to the advantages of iron propellers , nor have disasters , constantly recurring and of the most disheartening nature , shaken them from their purpose . The Montreal Ocean Steam Navigation Company has had an experience much more trying than any of our own companies have known ; for during the eight years of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The usual hazards of Atlantic navigation are augmented by the perils it has to encounter in the Lower St. Lawrence , and the officers of the company have not shown themselves competent to cope with them . The Provincial government pays it $400,000 a year for the conveyance of the mails weekly , and this subsidy , with a continually increasing business , has enabled it to bear up under its unprecedented misfortunes . There are two other lines in *operation from Montreal , to Liverpool and Glasgow , and a line to London has recently been initiated ; none of these receive government assistance . The North German Lloyds Company of Bremen and the llamburgh American Packet Company have opened regular communication with New York , by means of the same class of vessels of which we have been speaking . We have said that in 1850 all the steamships engaged in the transit between Europe and the United States , excepting only Cunard 's , were American . In 1S*34 there are twelve lines , and not one of them belongs to us . Of these , all except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steamers . The Galway line we do not include among existing companies . It is to be observed , also , that the German and the French vessels are all built in Great Britain , and it is a question well worthy of the consideration of our rulers , whether such a temporary relaxation of the navigation laws of the United States as would , for a year or two to come , allow foreign-built steamers of large tonnage and of the first class to be placed under our // 513 flag , would not be of the greatest service to us in many ways . By this means we should be able at once to obtain vessels for our projected steam lines , which our own ship-yards can not supply for several years . We think , also , it would be beneficial to our mechanics , to bring to their more particular notice the mode of construction and the propelling power which already control ocean navigation , and are destined to do so still more completely , and in which , it must be admitted , we as yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was much improved by the presence of the magnificent clippers which were purchased in Boston and New York for Liverpool account ; and although there certainly are builders in this country of approved skill , a moderate infusion of foreign ideas in our machine-shops would tend to give a higher character to our machinery . The frequent accidents which occur to the engines of our gunboats , and other naval vessels , demonstrate that we have still very much to learn in this respect . To complete the account of this class of steamships , we may state that the Peninsular and Oriental Company was the first to adopt screw steamers for its regular service ; in 1852 the Chusan , of 765 tons , and the Formosa , of 675 tons , were placed upon the route between Hong Kong and Shanghae . These were succeeded by the Bengal , of 2185 tons , and the Candia , of 1982 tons , between Suez and Calcutta . Of 73,285 tons owned by this company , 59,677 tons are in screw steamers , and these are mostly of iron . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be a reflection on the intelligence of our readers , to offer statistics for the purpose of showing that a nation is sure to reap direct and immediate benefit when it places itself in the closest possible communication with other lands . But it may be wGll to observe how the profits of commerce inevitably transfer themselves , from a nation which does not pursue such a policy , to its more enterprising rival . Our exports and imports are not affected , as relates to countries which are connected with us by steamship lines , by the question whether these lines are owned by our citizens or by foreigners ; but we are placed at a most serious disadvantage in trading to a country which is not connected with us iu this way , but which // is reached by the steamships of other nations . The Hon. Mr. Alley , in his speech on the Brazil Steamship Subsidy , shows how we have been losing ground in our intercourse with the countries of Central and of South America , while England has been continually gaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous to the rebellion , either decreased or remained during this same period - the last decade - almost stationary , while that of England flourished and increased , in many instances fourfold , under the fostering care of her subsidy system . In 1859 our trade with Mexico was in exports to that country about three and a half millions of dollars , and our imports from there about five and a half millions , upwards of four millions of which was specie . England exported and imported about four times as much during the same year . It should have been reversed . We should have had four times as much commerce with Mexico as England . " The following are the results of the steamship line between Great Britain and the Brazils , established in 1851 : - " The first year British exports were increased five millions of dollars , and the imports and exports of England with Brazil the first six years were doubled , while the six years immediately preceding the year 1851 , without steam communication , the trade remained stationary . " Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ millions ; in 1859 , about six millions ; in 1860 , nearly the same ; and in 1861 , within ten thousand dollars of amounting to five millions . " Our importations from Brazil during the same period - four years - were seventeen millions in 1858 , twenty-two millions in 1859 , twenty-one millions in 1860 , and something less than fifteen millions in 1861 . This enormous balance against us - an average annual amount of about thirteen millions - had to be wiped out , of course , in coin . Contrast this with the trade of Great Britain in 1861 . Her exports to Brazil amounted in that year to over twenty-eight millions of dollars , and her imports of Brazilian products ( other than specie ) less than half that sum , - making a balance in her favor of about the same number of millions as we show of balance against u s ,  --  a trade which greatly increases the wealth of England , and to no small extent impoverishes us . " It is not to be supposed that the people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which we have been engaged almost ever since we became a nation , and // permit the commerce of the world , our own included , to be carried on under foreign flags . Nor do we believe that the energy and skill of our merchants have been exhausted by the efforts hitherto made to establish American steamship lines on the ocean . Our business men are not easily discouraged or daunted , and the time is not distant when this whole subject will receive the attention which its importance deserves . It is to be hoped , however , that we shall profit by experience , that we shall undertake the work before us calmly , considerately , and prudently , and that we shall start on sound principles . The mortifying failures to which we have been subjected in the past indicate the dangers to which we shall be exposed , and which are to be avoided by us , in the future . One of these dangers , and not the least , is a spirit of rivalry and of national pride . Mr. ZRainey , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable information , but is strangely incorrect in its assertions about screw steamships , and , in our view , is altogether unsound in its advocacy of expensive mail lines , speaks of the Collins steamers thus : - " They have literally been engaged in a continual race across the ocean for seven years , determined at whatever cost and hazard to far excel those of the Cunard line . " No manufacturer , importer , or artisan could long maintain himself , who should adopt such a policy as this implies , and should estimate a nominal advantage gained over a rival above his own security and emolument . And yet the New York Memorialists ask of Congress " that subsidies shall be offered to a first-class line , to make weekly trips from New York to Liverpool and return ; and they ask this , not alone in the interest of the general trade of the country , for it can hardly be asserted that such a line is imperatively demanded , but because the pride of the country , as well as its position as a first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best and fastest line which shall connect the capitals of the two hemispheres . " Does the New York Chamber of Commerce want another Collins line ? In any such desire as this neither Congress nor the country can join with it . If there be no commercial neces // sity for an American line to Liverpool from New York , the same may not be , and probably is not , true of Boston , Philadelphia , and Baltimore , and " the pride of the country , as well as its position as a first-class maritime power , " would be sustained more creditably by a solvent and mainly self-supporting line from any one of those cities , than by a company at New York maintained by the public purse . But whether from New York or elsewhere , there are other attainments to desire than speed , and if American ocean steam navigation shall ever become successful , it will be when we have accepted some ideas in reference to it beyond and above those suggested by a regatta . Nor does it follow because Great Britain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , apart from all other considerations , the United States should place a line there also . The situation and circumstances of each nation must determine the routes which it can properly and profitably occupy . The English ocean post is not an artificial system ; but is the natural result of the situation of the British Islands , and of the extent and importance of the British colonies . Mr. Emerson in his " English Traits " says : " England resembles a ship in its shape , and , if it were one , its best admiral could not have worked it , or anchored it in a more judicious or effective position . The shop-keeping nation , to use a shop word , has a good stand . England is anchored at the side of Europe , and right in the heart of the modern world . " There are routes in the waters surrounding her , and along the coasts adjacent to her , where it would be folly for us to attempt competition . Her steamers trading to the various ports on the North Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belongs to her and to the other nations bordering on those seas . The service to Oporto , Lisbon , Gibraltar , Malta , and Alexandria , if not exactly belonging to her by geographical right , comes more naturally within her domain than ours . It must be remembered , also , that her colonial possessions in every quarter of the world make it imperative on her to keep up constant and reliable communication with them . She must knit firmly together her widely scattered provinces , or she can not retain her hold upon them . The security of these de . // pendencies had more to do with the development of her ocean postal system , than any determination to build up a worldwide commerce . British statesmen are not wanting in forethought or breadth of vision , in their care for the promotion of the national prosperity ; but we do not believe the wisest of them foresaw how wonderfully expansive and how richly remunerative the ocean mail service was to prove . They were shrewd enough , however , sooti to discover the advantage which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity . The first Cunard contract was made principally in the interest of British North America ; and Halifax and Boston were therefore selected as the Cunard ports on this continent . The service to New York was an afterthought , and grew out of this . In the same way , the service to the Brazils was the natural expansion of the contract for the West India mails . We all know the value which Great Britain places upon her Indian empire and upon her influence in the East . The political reasons for connecting herself with Asia by the shortest and quickest route are of the greatest weight ; and these explaiu the existence of the Peninsular and Oriental Company . On the other hand , we regard the ocean postal system of France as somewhat artificial . That she should navigate the Mediterranean by steam , is natural enough ; but there is no commercial necessity for her establishing independent lines on the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean , nor any political necessity , except that which grows out of jealousy of her neighbor . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , we look upon as of questionable policy . It is in accordance with the spirit of the French government to expend large sums of money to keep up a good appearance , and so long as these ships can be thus supported , they will probably *continue to run . How then shall we define the appropriate sphere for ocean steam navigation under the American flag ? In a word , it is that which belongs to us by geographical propriety . If the time shall come when this is fully occupied , the circumstances of the case will have changed , and we shall be warranted in passing beyond its limits . These limits , however , are neither // narrow nor confined . On our own shores we can develop a steamship system equal to that of all Europe in extent and in commercial value . The distance from Portland to the Gulf of Mexico is nearly as great as from Southampton by way of Gibraltar to Alexandria . These coastwise lines must be brought up to the highest point of efficiency and safety . Boston has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conservative basis , which promises well . If there be no inducement at the present time to start a similar line from New York , the shrewd merchants of that city will watch tim opportunities , and will be prompt to act when such a movement shall become a necessity . Instead of laying out parallel routes to Liverpool , llavre , Bremen , or Hamburg , as their Memorial contemplates , would it not be wiser to turn their attention to points with which we have no direct steam connection whatever ? We question the expediency , also , of organizing a new and intricate mail service among the various islands of the West Indies . Let us rather avail ourselves of the expensive and convenieiit service supported by Great Britain , and this we can do by means of our Havana and our St. Thomas steamers . Communication by steam with the Brazils , too long delayed , is likely soon to be established . By the authority of Congress , the Postmaster-General has advertised for tenders for a monthly service between " some port north of the Potomac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pernambuco , and Bahia . It is understood that the Brazilian government will unite with our own in subsidizing the proposed line , arid we may confidently hope that the increased intercourse which it will facilitate will prove highly beneficial to both nations . Another route , which by every right belongs to us , is between San Francisco and China . Our interest in the commerce of the East is second only to that of Great Britain , and we ought to secure ourselves in it by means of adequate steamship connections . But we can not sustain an East India line by way of Alexandria and Aden ; even with the completion of the Suez canal , we could not compete with the English and the French . On the Pacific we have a route peculiarly our own ; and if we are true to ourselves , no foreign companies can interfere // with us in its possession. * The first responsibility for making it available rests with the merchants of San Francisco , as being immediately and primarily interested in the result . They should organize a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theii come to New York and Boston to invite the co-operation of enterprising men in the Eastern States . Through their Chamber of Commerce , they have already memorialized Congress for its aid ; but in our opinion , every preliminary step should be taken before making application at Washington . When those who are most deeply concerned have pledged themselves that the work shall be accomplished , it will be comparatively easy to secure a postal contract . This suggests another error to be avoided in future efforts in behalf of American ocean steam navigation , namely , undue reliance upon the government . The Grand Dnke of Baden , the Viceroy of Egypt , and other potentates in the Old World , are the proprietors of the railways which traverse their dominions , and of other public works . In the United States we have been accustomed to depend upon ourselves in the development of great improvements . Our material prosperity is the result of private industry and energy , rather than of legislative expenditure . Some deviation *from this policy may be necessary in maturing our ocean postal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government should be incidental and subordinate ; it should tend to stimulate , not to stifle , individual enterprise and prudence ; and it should be designed , not to give existence to steamship companies , but to impart to them increased efficiency . Grants of public money will not communicate soundness to an unsound project , although they may essentially assist one that has the elements of success within itself . For political reasons , and contrary to its usual course , the British Parliament awarded to the Galway Company a large subsidy , equal for the service performed to the compensation of the Cunard Company ; but it was not large enough to give life to a concern which was destitute of all inherent vitality . The Collins contract was the most ample and generous ever enjoyed by any company ; what the result of it was , we now // Oct. know . Twenty-five years ago private capital could not cope with the pecuniary difficulties which then embarrassed ocean steamers ; but ingenuity and experience have wrought great changes , and now even in Great Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines are constantly going into operation without reference to or dependence upon aid from the government . The keen and philosophical observer from whom we have already quoted unfolds the secret of the success of the English steamers in a few words which deserve to be carefully pondered . He says : " Solvency is in the ideas and mechanism of an Englishman . The Crystal Palace is not considered honest until it pays ; - no matter how much convenience , beauty , or *clat , it must be self-supporting . They are contented with slower steamers , as long as they know that swifter boats lose moiiey . They proceed logically by the double method of labor and thrift . " Our government unquestionably has a duty to perform in this matter . It owes a fostering care to every national cuterprise , both on the land and on the sea ; and it has a direct interest in the fullest possible development of the national resources . That it has been more or less delinquent in regard to the ocean mail service , can not be denied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , too lax , and too lavish ; and its legislation was too exclusively for the benefit of that one company . When the company failed , steps should have been taken immediately to supply its place with a sounder , more efficient , and more trustworthy line . It was hardly statesmanlike to throw up the whole question in despair , and to abandon everything to foreigners , because in one instance a costly experiment had been unsuccessful . A special committee should have been appointed by Congress to make a thorough investigation into the causes of this failure , and to propose a plan for the future . Judicious intervention at that time on the part of the government would have eiicouraged new attempts , notwithstanding the disheartening effect of the misfortunes we have described . But this was wanting ; and our ocean commerce was permitted steadily to decline , uiitil , as has already been said , we are now dependent upon rival powers for the // conveyance of our mails , government despatches , and passengers , both private and official , to every quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we must now do , it is to be expected that the government will manifest a due regard for the great interests involved , and will carefully consider both the manner and the measure of the co-operation which it ought to render . As other governments evince a strong and energetic purpose to promote their own ends and to assist their own subjects on the ocean , it is not reasonable to ask our citizens to engage by themselves and unassisted in a struggle so unequal and so costly . The aid thus on good grounds to be anticipated should be given in the form of postal compensation , and in view of a full consideration to be returned . The public money ought to be appropriated for public , and not for private objects ; to promote the good of the community at large , and not to enhance the profits of proprietors or stockholders . If an American company undertake an important service with limited means , so that it can not employ as large a class of vessels , or make as many voyages , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be granted which will enable it to make its plan more comprehensive and more generally beneficial . The British government , in renewing a contract or increasing a subsidy , invariably requires an extension of the service , or such improvements as will render a fair equivalent for the prjvileges conferred . It is to be expected and to be desired that the enterprise of those who thus essentially advance the welfare of the community while seeking to use their money advantageously , should be amply rewarded ; and to this , as an indirect consequence of the discriminating action of the government , no one can object . We think it better for Congress to authorize a call for tenders , as it did at the last session , for the new Brazilian service , than to pass a bill in favor of a particular company . But it does not follow that the department should be restricted to the acceptance of the lowest bid . It should be left quite free to use its best judgment . Judge Collamer , whose familiarity with every postal question is well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject in the Senate , a few years ago , as follows : - // " I think these ocean contracts should be made just as mail contracts are on the land . When you have fixed the route , and declared that there shall be a mail line by steamship between a point on the American and on the European coast , or anywhere else , let the PostmasterGeneral advertise for and receive proposals . I do not say that the Department should be compelled to make a contract with the lowest bidder . I think he ought to have a discretion to nscertaia whether the lowest bidder is a man of straw , a man to go into the market and fix up a joint-stock company , sell shares , and let the government whistle for service . I think the Postmaster-General should have a discretion to see that the men who offer to make contracts are responsible , that they will carry out their contracts , and he should stipulate for the size , proportion , and rate of the vessels . " To give oniy the accruing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in the Transatlantic service would do injustice to a new American line . The various foreign steamers have adopted the best sailing days , and as the usage is to make up mails for them all , the letters which a new line would be likely to secure would be a small proportion of the whole , and would probably yield a less compensation than that received by the steamers sailing in competition with them . There are many reasons also why the present rates should be reduced , and this can not be accomplished if the cost of conveying the mails by sea is to be permanently provided for out of the postal earnings of mail steamers . It should not be expected that our ocean mail-service will be self-supporting ; it may be very profitable , and yet not in any direct maimer pay its own expenses . The commercial advantages which will follow an enlightened and liberal policy will vastly preponderate over any deficiency that may appear on the balance-sheet of the Department .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
