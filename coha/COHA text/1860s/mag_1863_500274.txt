THE CAUSES AND RESULTS OF THE WAR . THERE are certain theories in regard to the causes of the present war , which are so generally accepted as to have fortified themselves strongly in the principle of ' magncs e8t veritas et prevalebit . ' Theories based , however , upon facts which have taken their rise long since the true causes of the war had begun to work , and which , consequently , mistaking the effect for the cause , are from their nature ephemeral , and farther from the truth than they were at their origin . Few thinkers have looked below the surface of the matter , and the majority of Christendom , ignoring any other past than the few brief years that have rolled over our national existence , forgetting that great causes ofttimes smoulder unseen for centuries crc they burst forth in effects the more powerful from their long suppression , shaking the earth with the pent-up fury of ages-forgetting these things and arguing in the present instance from the few palpable facts found floating upon the surface of our society , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the present generation and its immediate predecessors . Herein lies the error which blinds the world as well to the warning of the past as to the momentous issue involved . Where then shall we look for the cause of that antagonism in which North and South are arrayed-that bitter hostility setting brother against brother , and father against child , dividing into two separate portions a nation descended from the same stock , whose archives are one , all whose associations of a glorious past are the same , and which has hitherto swept swiftly on to unparalleled wealth and power , seemingly indissolubly united , and looking forward to the same glorious and ever-expanding future ? Not to the of creeds , the loftiest of principles errors in our political system , for no would soon wither and die for lack of faults of government could , in a brief support . With every blessing that century , have produced such an upheaving of the foundations of society as we now behold-could have awakened such a thunder peal as is now causing the uttermost corners of the earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slavery , for however great a curse it may be to our people and soil , however brutalizing in its tendencies , however unjust to the negro race , and opposed to all the principles of enlightenment and human progress-of whatever crimes it may have been guilty , this last and greatest of crimes can not be laid at its door : for the bitterness of feeling between North and South existed long before the agitation of slavery was dreamed of , and the latter has only been seized upon as the ready means of accomplishing a greater design . Finally , not to any supposed desire in the Southern mind of establishing an independent empire of the South , whose people should be homogeneous , whose individual interests identical , and whose climate , productions , and institutions should move on in undisturbed harmony forever . For to this last a motive is wanting . Under no government that the world has ever known could the South have enjoyed so much freedom , such unexampled prosperity , such a rapid growth in wealth and power , in a word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts-as under this which they are so earnestly endeavoring to tear down and blot from the face of the earth . Men 's minds do not eagerly grasp and sternly pursue an abstract idea divorced from every consideration of self-interest , such as this would be . Even the greatest of moral principles are indebted to self-interest for their success , and without ' it the sublimest // heart could wish in the present , and with no hope through change of bettering their condition in a practical point of view in the future , the id*a of a great Southern empire , based upon such uncertain possibilities , would soon have disappeared from the Southern mind , even if it had ever existed . Nay ; the true cause is beneath and behind all these , taking its rise from the very foundations of English society in the dark ages , from the establishment of classes and distinctions of rank . In English history this principle reached its culmination in the wars of the Parliament , that great political tempest which changed the whole destiny and guided the future of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day , the dominant race of the old world . Its greatest development , however , was reserved for our day and our land . The England of the subsequent era was a new government , a new people . She reaped her harvest of good from her gigantic struggles , and so must we reap our harvest from ours . From the moment when the first settlers set foot upon our shores our inevitable destiny was foreshadowed ; the seeds of the Great Rebellion were even then deeply implanted , and all causes have since that day worked together for its fulfilment . We too must be purified by fire and sword ; and may we not hope that our beloved country may emerge from the slaughter , the ruin , and the conflagration , more prosperous , more powerful than ever before , and casting off the slough of impurity that has for long years been hardening upon her , renovated and redeemed by the struggle , sweep majestically on to a purer and nobler destiny than even our past has given promise of , and attain a loftier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The intimate relation of the feudal ages , between baron and retainer , established at first upon principles of individual safety and the public weal , soon degenerated into that of noble and serf . That which at first was but an honorable distinction between knight service on the one hand , and protection and patronage on the other , became , in the course of time , the baser relation of haughty assumption and oppression on the one hand , and the most abject servitude on the other . Descended from the same stern Saxon stock , separated only by purely artificial barriers , by the fortuitous circumstance of birth , the sturdy peasant could ill brook the tyranny of the privileged class-those lords rich in some dozen paltry villages . ' That stern independence which has ever been the prominent characteristic of the Saxon mind , *revolted at the palpable injustice of the relation of lord and serf . The aristocracy , on the contrary , fortified in their arrogance , at a later day , by the irruption of the Norman nobility , with their French ideas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the times and the light of dawning civilization , refused to give up one tittle of their assumed prerogatives , and became even more exacting in their demands , more lofty in their supposed superiority . Thus was engendered between the two classes a bitterness of feeling , a spirit of antagonism , that has never yet disappeared . Patiently did the peasant bide his time , and only when the tyranny became utterly unendurable did the movement commence which has swept downward to our time , reiving away one by one the miscalled privileges of the favored class , bringing , year by year , the condition of the laborer nearer to the true balance of society . This antagonism ieached its height in the Cromwellian era , and the men of those times stand forth upon the page of history as the exponents of the great principles of civil freedom . The strength of the Cromwellian party lay in the fact that it was composed almost entirely of the laboring and the middle classes , the bone and sinew of the land . Then for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aristocrat , and the strife regeneration of our race . Had the which ensued involved not so much the Cavaliers landed upon the shores of question of kingly prerogative and the Kew England , the bracing winds of divine right ' of monarchs , as the that northern clime , the rugged and pent-up qwq ments of its own continual purification . The Cavalier landed upon the shores of Virginia , and spread his settlements southward . The influence of climate upon both the physical and mental constitution of man is well known . The enervating climate of the sunny South , ' the soil fruitful beyond a parallel , pouring forth its products almost spontaneously , and , above all , the peculiar institution , ' which released the planter from the necessity of toil , all tended to aggravate the peculiarities of mind and body which the settlers inherited from their ancestors ; and the result has been a race which , while it presents here and there an example of brilliant , meteoric genius , is , in the main , both intellectually and physically inferior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same influences have fostered the aristocratic notions of the early settlers of the Southern States . With every element of a monarchy in their midst , the Gulf States have long been anything but a republic . IDe Bow , when* a few years since , he broached in his Review the idea , and prophesied the establishment of a monarch in our midst , was but giving expression to a feeling which had long been dominant in the Southern heart . All their institutions , associations , and reminiscences have tended steadily to this result , and in the event of the success of the rebellion , it needs but some bold apostle to take upon himself the propagation and execution of the plan , to make the idea a startling reality . And herein lies the secret of the sympathy of the English aristocracy with the confederates in their struggle for independent existence . The Puritan , guided by the hand of God , planted his future abode on the shores of New England , a land truly congenial to him , whose whole mental and physical life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fitter type in the human race have been found than he to tame the rock-crowned hills , to br3ve the rigors of such winters as Old England never knew , and the lurking dangers at the hands of a powerful and jealous race . Here was no place for indolence and luxurious ease . Only by the most persevering and painful labors could the bleak hills and gorge-like valleys he made to yield the fruits of life . Only by unremitting energy and the most patient self-denial could starvation he kept from his door , while constant watchfulness and neverflinching courage were required to ward off the many dangers that beset his path . Nature herself seemed pitted against him to contest every inch of his progress . But his nature was as stern and rough as that of the land he had come to tame . Accustomed to move steadily on in the pursuit of some one great purpose , to surmount every obstacle and crush every impediment , looking neither to the right nor the left , nor even pausing to pluck the flowrets that bloomed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail . Here the unbounded resources and exhaustless energy of body and mind found fitting scope . Whit to ordinary men would seem but hopeless , cheerless toil , was to him but pastime . The Puritan was just the man for New England , and New England the land for the Puritan . How he succeeded let all Christendom proclaim , for his works were not for himself nor his immediate posterity , but for the whole world . But it is not so much with the results of his labors that we have to do as with their effects upon himself and his posterity . Here , as in the case of the Cavalier , every circumstance of his life tended to aggravate the hereditary peculiarities of his class . The success of his enterprise , the crowning of those hopes which had led him to cast off all ties of the old world , the lofty spirit which induced him to reject all external aid , and , above all , the crisp , free mountain air he breathed , begot in him a feeling of independence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social equality , which have made themselves // manifest to all time . Where all were toilful laborers , and few possessed more than a sufficiency of worldly goods to provide for the necessities of the day , there was no room for the distinctions of rank . Power , with them , resided in the masses ; the results of their labor were common stock ; their interests were one and the same . Add to these facts their anc*ent hatred of the aristocracy , and we have the influences under which New England has ever tended to republicanism . The Puritan race has ever been republican to the core , and this is one great and vital respect in which they have continually diverged from their Southern brethren . Yet with all their virtues , with all their sublime heroism , was blended an inordinate , morbid selfishness . Shut in within their little republic from all communion with the outer world , lacking the healthful influences of conflicting ideas and that moral attrition which polishes the cosmopolitan man , enlarging his views of life and giving broader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the kinder sympathies and benevolent sensibilities of the heart , this little community became more set in their traditional opinions , and gradually imbibed a hearty contempt for all beyond the pale of their own religious belief , which soon extended to all without the bounds which circumscribed their narrow settlements . Living alike , thinking alike , feeling alike , placing under solemn ban all speculations in religion , and even all research into the deeper mysteries of natural science , grinding with iron heel the very germ of intellectual progress , in their blind presumption they would have closed the doors of heaven itself upon all mankind save the called and elected of the Puritan faith . This intellectual life was one of mere abstractions , and as a natural consequence all their thoughts and emotions , their joys and sorrows , their loves and hatreds , became morbid to the last degree . But the bent bow will seek release ; the re action came at last , and the astonishing mental progress of the New England of to-day , the wild speculation upon all questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most impious theories of the German metaphysicians , which our New England fosters and sustains , and above all , the proverbial trickery of the Yankee race , are but the reaction of the stern and gloomy tenets of that olden time which would have made of our earth a charnel house crowded with mouldering bones . In the midst of this intensely morbid Puritan life , no more eligible object could have been presented for the exercise of their bitterest antipathies than the descendants of their ancient enemies , the Cavaliers , who were already rivalling them in the South , and who , as we have shown , were equally ready to cast or lift the gauntlet . Occupying the very extremes of religious faith , radically differing in their views of public polity , of bitterly hostile antecedents and traditions , the one looking upon the other as an outcast from salvation itself and the other in its turn nothing loth brands its opponent with the epithets of surly , hypocritical , psalm-singing knaves , then as now , and as they have ever been since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood arrayed against each other in every respect save that of open , carnal warfare . The bitterest of foes in the beginning , diametrically opposed in every possible respect , each has plodded on in his own narrow path , and the two paths have continually diverged to our day , and . the present outbreak is but as the breaking of a sore which has long been ripe . It is of such antagonisms that nations are made : it is but differences such as these that have separated the common stock of Adam into 89 many distinct races and nationalities through all the ages of the world . Such a result we see to-day in our country , in two separate and distinct nations , hitherto nominally united under one // form of government-nations as distinct as ever were the Roman and the Greek . As the Cavalier of the Cromwellian era was a horror to the pharisaical Puritan , and the Puritan in his turn a contempt and an abomination to the reckless , pleasure-hunting Cavalier , so to-day is the psalm - singing , clock-peddling Yankee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lordly Southerner , and the reckless prodigal , dissipated and soulselling planter a thorn in the flesh of Puritan morality . The Yankee is to the Southerner a synonym for all that is low and base and cunning , and the Southerner is to the Yankee the embodiment of all worthlessness and crime . The same spirit is observable in those Northern States which were settled by a mixed emigration from both portions of the country , and the fact is well known that even in those loyal Western States where the Southern element most predominates , is found the bitterest hatred and denunciation of the Yankee ; so that he is no sage who draws the line east and west , north and south , and in every mixed community , between the descendant of the Cavalier , and the man of Puritan stock . Shall any one say that this is but the result of the war ? Where then does history record a like instance ? Where can be found the record of a civil war where the people , descended from a common stock and bound together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the call to arms , and waged a war so relentless and cruel even in its very commencement , except there had been radical antagonisms existing through a long series of years ? But it may be urged that a large portion of the Southern population are emigrants from the New England States , and consequently of Puritan descent , and that while this very class of slaveholders are notoriously the most cruel and exacting of masters , they stand in the front ranks of secession and are the most deadly enemies of the North . True , but the enmity of this class , wherever it exists , is that of the most sordid , unprincipled self-interest . Gold is their god , and all things else are sacrificed to the unhallowed lust . But this enmity is oftentimes assumed from motives of self-preservation . Objects of suspicion to the Simon-Pure Southerner from the very fact of their nativity , and visj*ted with the most horrible retribution wherever they have shown a leaning toward the land of their birth , they find it necessary to out-herod Herod in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly all . Hence , to disarm suspicion , often those have been made to take the more prominent positions in this tragic drama who , did circumstances permit the expression of their true sentiments , would be found to be at heart the most truly loyal citizens of the South . Another class-and this includes more particularly the descendants of Northern emigrants-born and bred among the moral influences of Southern society , imbibing all the ideas and prejudices of their surroundings , lose their identity as effectually as the raindrop is lost in the surging billows of the ocean . Drinking in with their years the pievailing hatred of the very stock from which their own descent is derived , they become part and parcel of the people among whom their lot is cast , and ordinarily run to the farthest extreme of the new nationality . Herein is seen the fallacy of the ancient maxim - Go ? lum , non animum mutant qui tran8 re currunt . The all-potent influence of self-interest , the overshadowing sway of undisputed dogmas , soon sweep away the lessons and prejudices of earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizen of the new clime and nation . Were the population of the South more equally divided between the Northern and Southern born , this would not be the case ; but in all the slaveholding States the Cavalier element so overwhelmingly predominates as to crush before it all opposing ideas , prejudices , and opinions . // This radical antagonism , smouldering for years , found its first great expression in the Tariff question of 1832 , which was not so much a question of State rights and agricultural interests as the vehicle , or rather the weapon of the pent-up hatred of years . General Jackson saw the true bearing and origin of the dispute ; and when he prophesied that the slavery question would be the next issue sprung by the designing revolutionists of the South , he did but show his appreciation of the great fact of the moral and physical antagonism between the descendants of the Cavalier and the Puritan . He might , and probably would , had circumstances required it , have gone farther , and prophesied , that should the slavery question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would soon be found and grasped by the apostles of separation and revolution , as a means for the accomplishment of their great design . He *done , of all our statesmen , with his far-seeing eye saw and appreciated the tremendous issue involved . He was sternly opposed to the compromise which was subsequently made , - well knowing that if the question were not then settled , at once and forever , the flame was but smothered for a time , to break out again in future years , with far greater vehemence . His policy was to crush the malcontents by the strong arm of power , to make such a display of the strength and resources of the Federal Govern*ent , . such an example of the fate which must ever await treason in our midst , and , above all , such a convincing manifestation of the utter hopelessness of all attempts to destroy a great and good government , deriving its powers and functions from the people themselves , as to put forever at rest the machinations of traitors and anarchists . Experience has shown that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if , in this our day , a second compromise be adopted , and a peace patched up upon a basis ignoring the true cause of dispute , or of oblivion to the past , or , worst of all , of yielding , on our part , one jot or tittle to the demands of our antagonists , as sure as there is a God in heaven-as sure as that retribution follows the sinner , the war will have to be fought over again , more savage , more bloody , and more desolating than ever , by our posterity , if not even in our own time . Fought over again , it once , but again and again , as often as the revolving wheel of human progress and enlightenment shall bring to the surface the black waters of the steaming cesspool below . But what of the result ? Watchman ! wh4 of the night ? The night is stormy and dark ; men 's hearts are failing them for fear ; those who see clearly in the day time , now grope helplessly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at a stand still , waiting and watching for the coming day . Yet afar off in the east the patriot 's eye may even now see the first faint streaks of that light which shall usher in the golden dawn . The result , in the event of the success of the North , is too palpable to require a moment 's thought , involving , as it does , every possible blessing to our race , every advantage to the progress of the new theories of social equality , and of man 's capacity for self-government . But what in the other event ? The evils would be legion-countless in number and direful in effect , not to us alone , but to the whole American race . First and foremost is that hydra precedent . We are fighting , not alone for the stability of any particular form of government , not alone for the sustaining of an administration , not alone for the upholding of those God-given ideas which have made America the most favored land on earth ; but against a PRECEDENT , which involves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ever has been , all powerful to overturn theories and systems , to topple kings from their thrones , and plunge nations into slavery . Of all dangers which every liberal form of // government has to shun , none is so deadly as this . Grave and venerable judges , sages though they may be , rest upon it , and thereon base decisions involving millions of property , and sometimes life itself . And though , as Blackstone has declared , a bad precedent in law is comparatively harmless , inasmtich as succeeding judges are in no wise bound by it , but free , and in fact bound to decide the law as it was before the evil precedent was established , and to interpret it as it ought to be , yet in national affairs this is not so . No matter how bad or absurd a precedent may be , designing men wi*l. be found in all ages and climes to avail themselves of it , honestly or dishonest ly . Men 's minds are not constructed alike , and that which seems evil to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theories , the basest of systems , the most suicidal of policies , will at all times find sincerely honest adherents and supporters . Individuality of mind admits a million of shades and degrees of right and wrong . Moreover , an idea once broached before the people , no matter how detestable it may at first appear , is already halfway advanced upon the road to execution . Thousands of criminals have been executed for crimes their minds would never have conceived save for the suggestion of some artful apostle of evil . Give me but a precedent once firmly established , I care not how bad it may be , and I shall revolutionize the world . And what is the precedent against which we have to contend ? It is that of separation . If secession would stop where it has begun , if the result of our defeat were to be but two great republics of the North and South upon our continent , there would still be room for the development of both , and we might even look forward to such a peace with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happiness and prosperity . But it will not stop here . As surely as that an overruling Providence directs the affairs of men , the movement will go on until there are as many separate and hostile republics as there are States in our Union . The mutterings of separation which have already been heard in the West , are but the precursors of the storm which can only be forever allayed by the triumph of our arms in the present contest . The slightest disagreement between the East and the West would soon be made a pretext for secession : the least dispute or conflicting interest between any two great portions of our country would find a speedy remedy in separation . The West would divide from the East , the Atlantic States from the Lake States , the Mississippi States from the Pacific , the North Pacific States from the South Pacific , and where would be the end ? Already the great West has learned her own gigantic strength , which before she knew not that she possessed , and if the time should come when her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the East , with such a precedent before her , would she not avail herself of that new-found strength ? Already the soldiers of the West have begun to sneer at the achievements of those of the East , and to consider themselves the braver and the manlier of the two . Are these not the signs of the times ? And do they rot betoken a future of anarchy in the event of the establishment of this most pernicious and monstrous of ' doctrines ? And is it to be expected that these many republics , monarchies , aristocracies , or whatever form they may take , will long remain at peace with each other ? Ask the muse who presides over the pages of history how often has her pen been called upon to record the circumstance of separate nations , of the same blood and antecedents , lying quietly and peaceably beside each other . Family quarrels are proverbially the most bitter of all on earth , and family hatreds the most unrelenting . It was but the ties of kin that lent such a character of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what shall we say of that scheme which aims at a reconstruction of the Union by leaving New England out ? Simply this : that , aside from any considerations of policy-without attempting to argue the question of a good or evil result from such a movement , the answer is plain enough : ? , ou can not do it  --  and that which is impossible needs no argument for or against . The energy and activity of mind and body , the lofty independence , the firm self-reliance , the dogged determination and undaunted adherence to a great and high purpose , of the whole Saxon race , is concentrated in the people of that mountain land . Theirs have been the heads to plan and the hands to execute every great work we have accomplished since the foundation of our nationality . The railroads and canals and telegraphs of the North , the South , the East , and the West are their work ; and their capital and their inventive , energetic minds still shape and control every great commercial enterprise of our land . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West , and opened the primeval forests of the Pacific States . Go where you will on the face of the earth , and you find them there before you , and ever the same busy , tireless apostles of progress , the leaders in every great work , and the rulers of commerce , everywhere looked up to as the type of the executive mind , and , by the tacit consent of Christendom , intrusted with the guidance of every enterprise requiring pluck , perseverance , and ceaseless activity . And theirs will still be the brains to control the destinies of our race , however isolated they may become , however they may be made the objects of distrust and contempt . Ay ! shut them out if you will , and from that moment New England becomes the Switzerland of America , the home of great ideas and great men , the temple where Freedom shall *325 take up her everlasting abode , and the altar fires of Liberty shall never die away . And her people will become the priests of that great religion which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true end of human existence , is already bursting out all over the Christian world , in fitful flames , which shall yet become the devouring *dement that shall wither and consume away oppression and kingcraft from the face of the earth . Shut her out , then , if you will , but you can not shut out the flame which she shall kindle ; you can not shut out the tones of her trumpet voice , proclaiming to the wQrld the doctrines of eternal truth . Self-reliant , possessing within themselves every element of success , her people can and will make their way , as heretofore , alone and unaided . Asking no favors of the world , they will pursue the even tenor of their way , undisturbed by the mutterings and growlings of their impotent foes , while their little republic , like a city set upon a hill , continues to reflect . from her glittering pinnacles the sunlight of heaven to all quarters of the earth . The petty vengeance which the disunionists of today are attempting to wreak upon her will recoil upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced some day to look to little New England as their redeemer from anarchy . A purely commercial people , her interests are not circumscribed by her narrow geographical limits but are , as well as her tastes and sympathies , cosmopolitan . She stretches out her feelers to all parts of the earth , wherever her wandering sons may have betaken themselves , and fastens there a little vine or creeper whose roots are still in her own bosom . rt is a part and a necessity of her very existence , to handle and direct catholic interests . This , as well as her position in other respects , has made her the arbiter of this nation and country , and you can no more shut her out from participation in the affairs of this continent than you can shut in the mighty river from its outlet to the ocean . And if The CcLuee8 and Re8uU8 of the War . // you cut her off , see to it that she does not become the little Rome whose conquering arms shall reduce all the nations of the continent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself too deeply in the hearts of the American people-she has sprinkled too many of her scions among the population of the West and South  --  to allow of a moment 's serious thought of cutting her off from our communion . The cry is but the party cry of the designiug and evil disposed , the traitors to our name and nation ; and with the crushing out of the rebellion and the restoration of our nationality , it will pass away forever . But to return to the direct results of the war . Having shown the threatened evils of separation , our province leads us no farther , for this comprises all the evils within the scope of man 's imagination . See , then , the issue involved : in our success lie all our hopes of future stability and prosperity ; in our failure lies slmply-iaevitable ruin . With such a prospect before them-with existence itself hanging in the balance-why are the people of the North asleep ? Why will they not see the true bearings of the war in this light , and arise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this infamous rebellion , even at the cost of the last dollar and the last drop of blood ? Shall we grumble at the cost of the war ? Shall we growl over the palt'y taxes w*hich , even yet , are scarcely felt ? Shall the father grieve for the loss of half his wealth which goes to redeem his only son from death-his darling from the power of the lions ' ? Shall the householder grumble over the reward he has offered for the rescue of his wife and little ones from the burning house ? Shall the felon begrudge the last cent of his earthly possessions that purchases his relief from the gallows ? Better that we should all be ruined-better that the land should be entirely depleted of its youth , and the country irretrievably in debt , with a prospect of a future and lasting peace , than a compromise now , with the inevitable certainty of everlasting war and tumult and bloodshed , worse , a thousand times worse than that of the South American States . Shall we make a peace now , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would this not be literally jumping out of the frying pan into the fire ' ? The war men of the North are the men of peace , and the so-called peace men are the men of eternal war ; those are they who would prolong the miseries of our country , simply by turning them in a new direction-by turning all our hostilities into our own bosoms and against ou*r own wives and children . Nay I there can be no pausing now . We have everything to gain by prosecuting the war to the bitter , even ruinous end ; everything to lose by leaving the work half done . The South is said to be fighting for its very existence ; yet not by a thousand degrees can this be as truly said of them as of us . Therefore should our earnestness , our enthusiasm , our determination , our desperation be a thousand times greater than theirs . Do yon tell me that we can not conquer so united , so brave , and so desperate a people ? I answer , WE MU5T . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other road left open for us ; the path to defeat is blocked by our own dead bodies . Unless the people of the North arouse and take hold of the work with an energy , an earnestness of purpose , to which the past bears no parallel , too late will they repent the folly of their own supineness , their own blindness . As in the affairs of men , so in those of nations , there is a critical point when those who hope for success must seize the winged moment as it llies and work steadily on with singleness of aim and unchangeable , unfalVering devotion of purpose . That moment , once past , will never return . Now is our golden opportunity , and according as we improve or neglect it will our future be one of greatness and power *r one of utter // nothingness among the nations of the earth . No subsequent time can repair the errors or failures of to-day . Since the greater part of this article was written , the prospect of our success has immeasurably brightened . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lulled into a false sense of security ; let us not be again deceived by the ignis fatuus glare which plays around our banners , and which has already so often lured us to forgetfulness and defeat . For the storm may again break forth in a moment when we think not of it , and from a quarter where we seemed the most secure . A single week may reverse every move upon the great chess board of strategy . There should be no relaxation of the sinews of war until the end is accomplished . So should we be safest in our watchfulness and strength , and , by the irresistible influence of overwhelming numbers and might , render that permanent which is now but evanescent . But , it will be asked , if there is between North and South an antipathy so deep seated and of such long standing , how shall we ever succeed in conquering a lasting peace ? how shall we ever persuade the people of the South to live in amity with a race so cordially hated and despised ? The question has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose clamors for a disgraceful peace have added strength to the cause of our opponents . The answer is so plain that it requires no demonstration . There is but one remedy for so sore a disease , and however severe it may be , however revolting to the tender sensibilities of peace-loving men , the inevitable and inexorable MUST urges it on to execution , and stands Jike a giant , blocking up every other path . It is like those dangerous remedies which the physician applies when the patient 's recovery is otherwise utterly hopeless , and which must result either in recovery or in death by its own agency rather than that of the disease . Concession has been tried in vain , moral suasion ' has been proved to be of no avail . The South must be shown how entirely hopeless must be every effort , in all time , to overturn such a government as ours . They must be made to feel our immense superiority in power and resources ; they must be shown in unmistakable colors the unconquerable might of nationality in strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own dependence upon the North ; in a word , every atom of resistance must be utterly and forever crushed out by brute force . To no other argument will they listen , as experience has proved ; and this last resort of kings ' must be exerted in all its strength and proclaimed in thunder tones , even though its reverberations should shake the earth to its very core . This done , and peace once more established , the South must be , not abolitionized , not colonized , not Puritanized , nor yet oppressed , but AMERIcANIZED . They must be familiarized with those immortal principles of justice and freedom , to which they have hitherto been strangers , which lie at the heart of all national success among an enlightened and Christian people . They must be made acquainted with the allimportant fact that we are a nation of one blood , one common ancestry ; that we can never live at peace as separate nationalities , and that only in unity and mutual concession and forbearance can a glorious destiny be wrought out for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for conciliation on our part , but yet conciliation never divided from the utmost vigilance and a firm support of the doctrine of national supremacy , as opposed to , and paramount to the iniquitous dogma of State rights . The people of the North must first divest themselves of all prejudices , all hereditary antipathies , and wipe away old scores in the dawn of a golden future . Then will our brethren of the South not be slow to respond to the proffered peace and good will and brotherly kindness , and again we shall // become a prosperous , united , and happy people . And what a future lies before our country ! What a wealth of uncultivated fields lies waiting for the plough of the adventurous emigrant ! What unmeasured wilds wait but for the touch of enlightened and educated labor , to blossom like the rose , to become the site of great cities and smiling villages , the resting place of the wanderer from all quarters of the globe , the residence of a great people , the component parts of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of the creation ! It needs but ordinary human foresight to see that here is to be the fountain head , the permanent abiding place , of four great interests , with which we shall rule the world : manufactures , grain , cotton , and wine . The Great West is to feed all Europe with her harvests of yellow grain ; the South , with her cotton interest , is to clothe , not Europe only , but the world ; the Pacific States will be the vineland ' of America , furnishing the wherewithal to gladden the heart of man , ' while the manufactares of New England and the IMiddle States shall furnish the implemerits of labor to the brethren all over the continent , and turn the raw material both of the South and of their own sheep-feeding hills into garments for the toiling millions of America . Here , then , we shall produce , as no other country can , the great staples of life ; and when we add to them those considerable minor interests which we share more equally with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well of the precious ores as of coal and the baser metals , how stupen dous seem our resources , how tremendous the influence we are to wield among the great human family I And is it a necessity of social life that these great interests should jar ? that political commercial antagonisms should spring up between these cumulators of the world 's great stock of wealth , for no better reason than that their hands are engaged upon a different work , or , rather , upon different branches of the same great work of production ? Nay , verily I So long as we are bound together by a common tie of country , living and working under the same laws and institutions , such antagonisms can only exist in the brains of designing demagogues . So far from confficting , these great interests will , from the very nature of the law of exchange , work harmoniously together , blending the one into the other as perfectly fitting parts of one concordant whole . One section will play into the hands of another , sustaining each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will find in his brother the readiest consumer of the products of his labor . Only in the event of separation can jealousies , antipathies , and narrow-minded prejudices spring up between the different sections , and healthy competition be degraded into low and mercenary jobbing ; only by separation can the onward march of the American race be retarded and the arm of American industry paralyzed . Accursed , then , be the hand that aims a blow at the foundations of our fair fabric of Liberty ; thrice accursed he whose voice is raised in the promulgation of those pernicious doctrines whose end is to lead a great people astray .
