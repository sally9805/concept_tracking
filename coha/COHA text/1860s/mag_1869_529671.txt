txt CONSUMPTION IN AMERICA . *I . Want of Sun ? zgkt as a Promoter of Gonsum*tion . IT is hard to prove the direct agency of a want of sunlight in the production of consumption . Reasoning from analogy , however , we might infer that , as plants grow up thin and white and unhealthy when deprived of light , so , under similar circumstances , the human being would suffer . But we see the evil influence on man caused by absence of the sun 's rays , in the pallid and emaciated forms of many of the children of the poor , particularly of those living where the direct sunlight can not enter . It is true that want of proper food , &amp;c. must usually have their own specific effects conjoined with this . Nevertheless ; to any one who has experienced the genial glow coming from the sun on an early spring day , little will be needed to prove its strengthening power . All modern science tends to make the sun the centre of force and of life to vegetables and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for they had their sotaria on the house-roofs , where they could enjoy in quiet their sun-baths . We , on the contrary , often place our sick on the north side of the house , where the sun never enters ; or , perchance , if we have them in a southern room , we close all the blinds and curtains of its windows for the sake of our Brussels carpets , thereby unconsciously demonstrating that we think more o.f our finery than of the health of our households . We believe firmly that to the influence of pure air and direct sunlight we owe a vast deal of our common every-day health . Hence , in the treatment of our patients , we always seek to unite these advantages . We have been told by some consumptives that one of the best prescriptions we have made has been their removal from a north room to the sunny south chamber . As we write , two cases come to mind , strikingly illustrative of the sun 's benign influence . We had been attending , at an orphan asylum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ill of severe typhoid fever . She was wholly prostrated in mind and body , and emaciated to the last degree . It was plain that she was falling into that depressed condition of all the powers of life that so often precedes consumption : Day // 178 after day we visited her , but all recuperative power seemed lost . Half dead and alive , the little creature neither spoke nor moved , and ate only on compulsion . One day , on our way to visit her , we felt that elastic thrill which the warm rays of the sun impart in the early cool weather of spring . We involuntarily leaped along , and were instantly struck with the fact that " virtue had gone out of us " when we left behind us the sunlight and warmth of the street and entered that northern chamber , the dormitory of the poor orphan . That inspiriting influence the invalid had never experienced in the slightest degree during the whole of her sickness , as , owing to its peculiar situation , not a ray of direct sunlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and for the first time considered the depth of her loss , and our own remissness in regard to her . The air of the room had been pure , the ceilings of the infirmary were lofty , the attendants had been faithful and sagacious . Nothing seemed lacking , in fact , to restore health . Yet it did not come . On the contrary , there seenied a constant downward tendency . " A sun-bath in the warm rays of this delicious spring day is what this girl needs , " we instantly said to the sister superior . This lady gladly consented to the change , and placed the little patient in another room having a southern aspect , and consequently filled with sunlight . The invalid immediately recognized the change , and asked , in her weak way , to have the curtains raised , so as to let in the full blaze of the light . So on she wanted to sit up , and directed that the easy-chair , in whlch she was propped , should be so placed as to allow her whole body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun . It was the natural tendency of disease , seeking for all liferenovating influences . And we have never met with so marked or so rapid irirprovement as immediately began in the body and mind of the girl . Appetite and strength increased daily , and with them burst forth again all the joyousness of the child 's heart . Another analogous case , which , although we do not demonstrate by it the influence of the sun alone , we can not forbear to name , because by such examples we impress perhaps on the minds of our readers the real principles underlying the whole question . A lady aged about thirty , resident in the northern part , of New En*land , consulted us for undoubted tubercular disease of the lungs . Her house was well situated , and on the side towards the south was a small piazza resting on stone steps , which was raised two or three feet above the ground . The winter was approaching and rules were to be given . Having full faith in these divine influences of pure air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on this piazza every day during the winter , unless it were too stormy . It was so arranged as to shut out the cool air on three sides , and to admit the full blaze of sunlight in front . Here , according to our directions , she used to sit wrapped in furs , reading or writing for several hours each day during the following winter , and with most excellent results . She was directed frequently to make deep inspirations , in order to fill the lungs with pure air . She was never chilled , because the sun 's rays and her warm clothing prevented it . She never " took cold " there . On the contrary , the balmy influences exerted upon her by her daily sun and air bath were so grateful ; her breathing became so much easier after each of them , that , whenever a storm came , and prevented the resort to the piazza , the invalid suffered in consequence thereof . Whether these remarks will prove to our readers that want of sunlight may be reckoned among the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , at least , they will convince some sceptics that sunlight has a potent influence in raising the human body from various weaknesses that sometimes are the precursors of fatal phthisis. // Want of Pure Air a Promoter of ( *onsu ; ni5tion . We mean by this , not only air uncontaminated by distinctly unpleasant and noxious odors , but all air which , whether perceptibly bad or not , has lost the necessary elements for perfect health . Understood in this way , how few houses in modern times , especially in winter , nay , at all seasons , save in the warmest veather of summer , present the requisite amount of pure air for those who live in them ! In this respect we are infinitely poorer than our ancestors . We contend that , if it be possible , no person ought to breathe a second time the air that has been once expired . Look at what occurs at each act of inspiration . The oxygen of the inspired air is partly absorbed into the system of him who breathes it , and carbonic-acid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is returned in expiration . If , therefore , we should definitely close up a room , and put a certain number of persons in it , without allowing sufficient of the outward air to enter , all of them would soon die of actual suffocation , or be at least made seriously ill , simply from the breathing of such air . If more time were used , and a little pure air only occasionally were admitted to the apartment , a prostrating fever would arise in any animals or men thus closed up . Continue a similar but less confined treatment , and you would bring about more slowly emaciation , debility , prostration4of all the bodily powers , and , after a time , true consumption might and would be very liable to occur . In the light of these statements let us see how our predecessors of older and of later times lived , and whether web ave improved upon their methods . One has only to glance at the noble opening in the dome of the Pantheon at Rome , or , still better ( because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smoky aperture in Cardinal Wolsey 's lofty kitchen at Oxford , and he will be sure of one fact at least , namely , that those who lived in former days were not afraid of feeling or of breathing the open air . Our American ancestors also built houses in which the chimneys were fitted for something more than mere throats through which the smoke could escape , though each of them , doubtless , " builded better than he knew . Some of us , even at the present day , remember the massive and widely opened chimney-pieces and the broad hearth-stones , capable of receiving logs of immense size . In those days the hearth-stone was really the gatheringplace for the family . Around that roaring " ventilating shaft , " as it woul*l be called now , the children conned their lessons or told their fairy-tales , while their elders , perhaps , smoked their pipes ; and yet , from the very nature of the arrangements , the air must have been purer than can by any means be found around our detestable air-tight stoves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flues of the modern hot-air furnace , or coils for hot water and steam . Formerly there was less fear of drafts ; no double windows were needed , but the father and his children drank in from their own hearth , warm , pure , but not over-heated air ; while at the same time they were all fancy fed by the beautiful flame as it flickered and sang its quiet song all day , and each heart was brightened at evening , when the family gathered around it from their various labors . Now all is altered . The idea of a family hearth is lost , save as sung i9 old-fashioned poetry . The children of the present day know of it only by hearsay . Instead of all this they collect at a table at which burns the badly trimmed , perhaps ill - smelling , kerosene lamp , or under the bright blaze and heat of gaslight , while the room is wa*rmed by the furnace or air-tight stove . What is an air-tight stove ? Let us try to answer . If we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no one who would not anticipate evil . Bad air , as people commonly say , - carbonic acid and oxide gases , according to chemistry , - would soon arise , and death of the inmates would result if no // help in the form of the external air should come to their relief . What real difference is there between thus building a fire in the middle of a closed room and the starting of one in an air-tight stove , and then shutting the damper to prevent too rapid combustion ? With the damper closed , we have a state of things almost entirely analogous to an open grate of coals in the middle of a closed room . For the carbonic oxide , that deadly gas , begins to be given off almost immediately after the fire is lighted . It penetrates into the room , through not only the crevices of the stove , but also through the very pores of the iron itself . This has been proved completely by European science , for attention has been recently very strongly brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which this fact was stated . Meanwhile we have , in our medical experience , been often convinced that all human beings suffer somewhat when exposed to these stoves , and especially do those afflicted with lung disease have a difficulty of breathing when in a room thus warmed . By ordering their removal , and by opening the chimneys , relief more or less marked has always been immediately obtained by our patients . A certain freedom of breath has been restored to them , which they did not have while the stove contaminated the air with its noxious vapors . Hence we have arrived at the conclusion that this must be our first object in the treatment of any pulmonary difficulty . It is next in importance to exercise in the open air . Wa ; zt of Good Food and of Pr*r Digestion bring consumption . Consumption literally means a want of proper nutrition . Hence it is evident that , if good food be not given , evil will be the result . Usually this influence is seen in connection with other deleterious agencies already spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature of the disease , and bad air and confined employments , so that it is hard to eliminate this cause from many others . But by the following statements our readers will , we hope , be convinced that want of good food is not to be neglected as one cause of consumption . We do not remember a single case in which food alone caused the trouble , when all other influences were good . But it is undeniable that , given an undoubted case of threatened or of actual consumption , then such a case with poor nutrition , owing to imperfect or improper food , will run rapidly towards death if the same course be continued , - whereas it will , perhaps , be wholly turned towards health , if only this element of cure be fully and fitly introduced . The unfortunate prisoners at Andersonville had too little food , and became terribly emaciated ; but the whole nervous system rather than the lungs was affected . In these sad cases so many other horrible circumstances were occurring , in addition to the starvation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . But no one can deny , as already stated , that , if you place a patient suffering from consumption in the best circumstances , and neglect to provide him with proper food , he will die . Give him proper food and drink , and he will live . But how rare it is in this country to find upon the tables of either rich or poor or middle classes plenty of wholesome , sim/fle , and nutritious food ! It will be the greatest blessing to the subsequent generations when all the girls in our public schools are taught by some Professor Blot to make good bread and simple puddings , and how to cook simply the various meats and vegetables . At the same time it will be important to impress upon the community at large that it should have nothing but such food on its tables . Let any one pass a night in any of our country towns , and , unless he happen to be at the house of the physician , he will probably be asked , at breakfast , to partake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compound for any stomach , - not tending , // as all food should tend , to perfect digestion . Instead of pure , light bread and sweet butter , and perhaps a small slice of fresh meat , with coffee or tea , the traveller is compelled - often under the penalty of giving offence if he refuse - to partake of heavy , and perchance sour or cream-of-tartar bread , with perhaps rancid or heavily salted butter , two or three different kinds of pies , pickles , cheese , and doughnuts , followed by two or three different kinds of cake . We do not present this as uniformly the character of New England farm-house fare , but the fact that such fare is ever proffered in any community seems to indicate a want ef proper public opinion upon the subject of diet , that is very much to be regretted . In cities bow common is it to see young and old collected for dinner at restaurants and railroad stations , eating wretched preparations called food , and even bolting that without proper mastication . The inevitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among which comes rapidly along , in not a few cases , consumption . Sap a man 's digestion , and you make him a fit subject for this disease . For it is a fact well known to physicians , that , if a man have dyspepsia for several months , and then cough begin , he rarely escapes with his life . Hence , though bad or imperfect food may not be proved to be positively the cause of consumption , we see the importance of good food and drink as a preventive of it . What that food should be we defer speaking of until later in this paper . Insuf/icient or Ivz*5e ; fect Clothing as a Gause of Consumption . This is not so evidently a cause of consumption as some other influences of which we have spoken ; yet we think there can be but little doubt that , indirectly at least , any carelessness in this respect , as is often caused by fashion , is fraught . with danger . Only a few years since our ladies were unwilling to wear shoes appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . " And the time has passed by when we may neglect a cold as among the remote but undoubted causes of consumption . Our young ladies , and not a few gent*emen , formerly used stays so tightly laced as to press deeply into all the internal organs near the waist , and thus prevented free expansion of the lungs ; whereas the surest way to prevent consumption is to daily and hourly fill these same lungs with pure air . How can that be done with a tight band around the waist ? These articles are less used than formerly , and , if used , are applied less tightly , and so far our clothing has improved of late years . At the present time the extraordinary exposure of the person , when driving in party dresses to the ball in winter nights , is fearful , and the return home , after the whirl of the waltz , and when every fibre of the young frame is palpitating , is eminently hazardous . We might name other similar imprudences . In general it may be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount and proper kind of clothing is perilous . On the other hand , th.ere are cases when from over-caution injury is done , and the person is weighed down and exhausted by too much clothing . We have seen children perspiring and losing flesh and strength under the flannels prepared for them in the depth of summer by over-anxious mothers . Adults , too , at times sweat like training prize-fighters under thick flannel shirts during the day and woollen blankets at night , for " fear of taking cold ! " One day in summer , when the thermometer was above 900 in the shade , we were called upon by a patient who had a shawl wrapped over his ears so that we could hardly see his face , and on disrobing him for examination we found he had two overcoats and three flannel shirts , besides the usual dress worn by a man ! On our protesting that such an amount of clothing was injurious and depressing , actually tending to increase his disease , he , innocently assured me that he clothed himself // so warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more absurd . We have only to keep an animal too warm and too quiet , and we can produce tubercular disease . A *dM de foic gra : , s proves this . In conclusion we may say , that , although we have had no case of consumption that we deem fairly attributable by itself alone to a want of ; or an abuse of clothing , we have no doubt of its important influence on the cause of consumption , and that often an attention to , or a neglect of common hygienic rules , in this respect , tends to check or aggravate the disease , or even , in some cases perhaps , to be the first excitat*t of it . Is our System of Education a Promoter of C*onsumj5tion . We believe the affirmative of this question to be true , at least as applied to the Northern and Western States . We have had too many bitter experiences of its influence to have a shadow of a doubt on this point in reference to New England . We appeal to every physician of ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in reviewin* his cases of consumption , he will find not a few of them in which he will trace to overwork in our grammar or Normal Schools the first springs of the malady . We pride ourselves , and justly so , on our system of public-school education . Without an intelligent reading people , a democratic corn rnonwealth is the veriest farce possible . Education is the life-blood of our Republic . Without it our nation would fall . It saved us in our late Rebellion . Here in New England it provides our chief annual crop for exportation to other parts of the country . Havinb thus , as our readers will see , the strongest love and respect for our system of education , we nevertheless assert that it is grossly imperfect in one great particular , while actually injurious to the health of the community in others . It wholly neglects the body in the desire to cram the memory and stimulate the intellect . This is evident at a glance . Instead of looking to the full development of a youth , both body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for the proper manly and womanly physical development of the children ? A vacation is occasionally given ; but where is the proper *hysical training of the pupils ? Nowhere . Surely nothing can be more absurd than this ; but it is not the less true . What school - committee - man thinks of a rounded , full-developed muscle and vigorous frame of body as the precursor of ; support , and actual aid to a noble , well-balanced intellect ? Who thinks of turning out of our schools muscular young scholars ? Durinb the Rebellion , and in some instances since the war ended , some school , here or there , has introduced a military drill as a part of its regular curriculum . To us this was one of the most hopeful of signs . But neither parents , teachers , nor pupils ever entered , save spasmodically , into the plan ; and now we fear that what was spasmodically commenced will be given up , just as it was beginning to unfold some narrow chests , and thus to prove of inestimable value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various exercises the air is introduced into the minutest cells of the lungs , and all the limbs of the boys are beautifully rounded out . But , as we have said , we fear from present appearances that even these few exercises will erelong be discontinued . It is true that the Latin and High School of Boston , and a few more in the country , still continue the drills introduced into them under the stimulus of the Rebellion . But as one swallow does not make a spring , so the drilling of one or two schools does not constitute a system of physical education for our whole community . It is ludicrously absurd to even think of it in that light . Besides , any school education that systematically neglects one half of our young people , namely , the girls , the future wives and mothers of the state , is a lamentable failure in one of its most // important duties . No one can deny this proposition . Common experience teaches all of us that we can not have a healthfully acting mind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mens sana in corpore sano , " is practically ignored by our school committees . They vainly hope to do what nature will not allow them to do , namely , to stimulate the intellect at the expense of the body , or at least without reference to the wants of the body . The attempt can not be made without peril to both . Man is of a compound nature , which needs harmonious development . An iIndz4e attention to one part generally brings neglect of another , and as a consequence arise either gross monstrosities , disease , or death . If there he one truth that modern physiology teaches , it is that every intellectual effort , every noble aspiration , every emotion of the heart , depends for its perfect healthfulness upon the equally peffect play of some of the minutest parts of our physical frames . Especially is this true of that delicate structure , the so-called nervous system . Put that out of order , as we are very apt to do by over-stimulation of it at school , and soon all the frame @f @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but unmitigated evil results . It is singular to what extent errors on this subject exist . A few years ago the subject of " Education in our public schools , and its effect on public health , " was proposed as a proper subject for discussion in the Suffolk District Medical Society . The society contains all the educated physicians of Suffolk County , and therefore mi*ht naturally be deemed a proper arena for the debate . But the proposer soon found to his sorrow that the discussion would be a very heated one , and productive of great personal ill-feeling . Man yof the society , being members of the school board , considered themselves personally* " insulted " at the bare thought that the school system could be productive of aught but good . The result was that no action was ever definitely taken on the subject . Of late years the love of athletic sports is increasing among young men , and good will doubtless result ; but it may be questioned whether the extravagance of youth and the general tendency of our country to o*ierdo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneficial amusements , whereas a regular system of physical education established by the school committee would not be so liable to abuse . But not only does our school system , in its practical operation , entirely ignore the necessity for physical culture , but it at times goes further , and actually , as we believe , becomes the slayer of our people . And- this brings us to the especial object of these remarics , namely , our system of education as a cause of consumption . During the past twenty-five years we have met with not a few cases like the followincr : A child of not unhealthy parents , resident in the city , is sent in early life to one of our common schools . Eager to learn , quiet and retiring in disposition , loving books rather than society , the pupil soon becomes the favorite of the teacher , and prominent in the class . In addition to the love and commendation of the teacher , such a child has usually placed before him the stimulus of prizes to be won , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school . As he is willing and apparently intellectually able to work , extra duties are probably put upon him . The parents , ignorant of physiological laws , are proud of the success , and stimulate the poor child still further by urging it to try to gain the prize already too much coveted . The evenings at home , instead of being devoted to a gentle home education , which parents should always be able to give to their children , and which should be considered by them a sacred duty , are occupied by school studies often till late at night . At break of day , the child 's first thought is of grammar , instead of the quiet loveliness of the morning . A lesson in philosophy , perhaps , // takes the place of a prayer , or of a run out into the purest of God 's blessings , the clean and clear morning air . Breakfast is swallowed , and off to school races the half-tired young victim , nervously anxious for fear of having ill prepared the lesson , and weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from sleep disturbed by dreams of lessons lost and gained . The forenoon is passed , certainly in winter , in an atmosphere totally unfit for human beings to live in , - furnace-heated , insufficiently ventilated , usually of a temperature above 700 , and alternately heated to a close stifling degree , or chilled by the open windows , raised from time to time in order that teacher and pupil may momentarily breathe * with comfort . The interval between school-hours not infrequently is more or less occupied with lessons or reading , because the child " loves reading and hates to walk . " Meanwhile parents and teachers and committee-men stand by and see this process of gradual deterioration of physical health which must inevitably follow such a course of folly . The result of all this school training is as certain as the day . Every child who goes through the above process must inevitably suffer , but not all alike . Some have one complaint , some another , and some , doubtless , finally escape unharmed . At times , they only grow pale and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to the exbibition , and , after working harder than ever for the two or three last weeks of the term they gain the much-coveted prize only tobreak wholly down when it is taken . The stimulus of desire for success is gone . That has sustained them up to the last moment . Success having been accomplished , the victim finds , too late , that what it has been striving for is nothing now that it is won . But all * This is no fancy sketch . We visited one of our sehool-houses last year , in which we could not have stayed half an hour without great distress of body . The temperature was far above 70 , and the air had apparently been breathed over and over again . he whole body became bathed in copious perspiration during the few moments that we remained in the room , and we did not wonder that the scholars had headaches and appeared a puny set . vitality seems gone out . The previous weak health , which mental stimulus had sustained without open complaint , gives way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of appetite and loss of strength . The slight cough , scarcely noticed before , becomes more marked , and the physician is summoned . Almost uniformly in the cases of this kind does he find fatal , perhaps faradvanced disease of the lungs . This result has happened in all our institutions for instruction , whether grammar , high , Latin , or Normal schools , or colleges . The ttsing-ii*5 process in the colleges is not unfrequently somewhat in this wise : A young farmer or mechanic or laborer , apparently in good health , but somewhat advanced in life , determines to be educated , and to go through college . He wants his teacher to " put him through " in the shortest possible space of time . He prepares himself to enter college in two years , whereas usually five or six years are needed . After entering , he has to study hard to keep up even with his juniors . Imperfectly educated , he feels himself no match with the trained athletes of the academic course . Hence arises in his mind the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day no physical exercise is taken . Perhaps , poor in purse , he attempts to board himself on small and imperfect fare ; thus in another and equally fatal way undermining his already overstrained and weakened constitution . He has also the stimulus of ambition as well as poverty to urge him to grasp , if possible , a scholarship , in order to eke out his scanty means of support , or perhaps release himself from the burden of dependence on another 's most willing charity . Some men will be able to stand all this , and come out apparently without injury . Very few , however , will dare to advise any one else to undergo the same trials ; for they feel that physiological laws can not be set at naught with impunity , and most of such persons bear to their graves a consciousness of evil done , even though // in the eyes of the community eminently successful men . Such men are often in the ranks of the melancholy sermonizers , or dyspeptic lawyers , irritable , Abernethian physicians , whom we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already alluded . A certain unhealthy tinge , so to speak , covers their whole subsequent life , - delicate , most transitory , and fickle of appearance though it may be , it is nevertheless there , and quite perceptible to themselves , if not to others . In some the sting goes deeper , and the currents of life are so vitiated that but a little more work is needed , after leaving college , in order to make them fit subjects for consumption . A trivial exposure of these unfortunate victims of their own or of society 's reckless folly develops a slight , at first scarcely noticeable cough . " It means nothing , " the sufferer says , and really believes . But it lasts one , two , o* three months . After all this ambitious toil for an intellectual education at the expense of his physical frame , he awakens from his delicious dream of ultimate success in his undertaking to the sad reality of impending death by consumptioiT . This , again , is no fancy sketch . We have seen this result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject . We now hear with a certain horror the fact stated , that a youth , who from childhood to early manhood has been engaged in active pursuits , has suddenly become smitten with a love of learning , or intends to prepare for the ministry ; for we are sure that he will suddenly leave all the labors requiring active bodily exercise , and will devote himself to purely intellectual work , with very few or no tasks for the body . A premature grave , or long , inefficient death in ife , is almost always the final result . And we are equally confident that such is not the necessary effect of study , and that it will not happen when wisdom shall prevail . The only way , however , to prevent it , is to have our school and college systems so managed that the body , as well as the mind , shall be so educated as to produce perfect men and women . And if ; perchance , a youth commence late in life to study , let him not be allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year that usually require four . Let him , above all things , never forget that , as he leaves an active , hardworking life , he , abo*'e all others , is bound to the daily practice of open-air exercise , and such a course of gymnastic work as will tend to *erfect*hysical health . Mental Emotions and Depressing Passions as Canses of C'onsu*nption . Most writers speak of these influences as being quite powerful causes of consumption . We have never seen a proof of the truth of this assertion . We fear that death even from a " broken heart " belongs rather to the ideal world of poetry than to that of fact . The lyre of Moore and the exquisite poetic prose of Irving would almost persuade us that such deaths are perhaps common . We will not deny their existence , but we have never seen them . Nature usually does not act in that way . On the contrary , we have seen cases where mental suffering , falling upon broad religieus natures , has really ennobled the whole physical and mental life afterwards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose themselves in sympathy with others . Others , however , of less elevated characters are doubtless injured by suffering . Absorbed in themselves , becoming careless of their physical well-being , they allow themselves to neglect all these rules of health often alluded to in this paper . Consequently they may readily become victims of any disease to which , by hereditary influences or any of the causes heretofore named they may be in danger , and from which , without this superadded sorrow , they would have escaped . Among these diseases stands consumption . How we shall deal with such cases , and others similar in character we shall speak of later . 4 // Excesses of Various Kinds as Causes of 67onsumjtion . All excess is unnatural and morbid . Of itself it brings disease and death inevitably in its train . Even a good , used extravagantly , tends to evil . All evil has , as its real seminal principle , a certain trace of good . It is good run mad* The abuse of liquor , repeated and lonb , continued drunkenness , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stimulants is in some constitutions , and under conditions of weakness of ' body , not radically evil . We are inclined also to believe that , with other constitutions , and especially after a certain age , they tend to prolong life , and to make that life better able to perform its various duties . We know this opinion runs counter to the views of many ; nevertheless , it is really " Gospel truth , " and as such we avow it . At the same time we would denounce as earnestly as we can all intemperate use of liquor ; and for this purpose we have no hesitation in presenting to the drunkard , as among the many loathsome diseases to which his beastly habits may lead him , this most terrible of all diseases , consumption . Habitual intoxication , strikes at the healthy action of all the great functions of the body . It stimulates and goads the nervous system to insanity , though it may be temporary . It drives the blood in rapid currents through the heart and bloodvessels , putting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform . Hence arise obstructions of various internal organs of the liver , kidneys , heart , &amp;c. , with dropsies and organic diseases as a consequence . Moreover , the appetite for common food palls under the constant recourse to the dram-bottle , and " good digestion " never " waits on appetite , " even if ; in spite of the constant use of alcohol , appetite , that saviour of the natural being , does still exist . Attacking thus all the main foundations of human health , it is not surprising if ; at times , the drunkard is fairly worn down , and consumption at last sets in . Hence the common suggestion that the drunkard of the tubercular family is apt to escape consumption is by no means strictly tri. *e . The man who indulges too freely runs a great risk of dying of consumption , while at the same time he is much more ZiabZe than others to die of any of the more common longcontinued diseases to which man is subject . He is also much more frequently than others struck suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitual drinker meretfy for j5ieasure finds* comfort and a relief to his conscience from what e have admitted above in regard to the certain amount of value to be attached to the moderate and appropriate use of stimulants , he must be very easily satisfied , and for such a man warning is useless . One other species of excess we deem it our duty to allude to in this connect*n , although to some prudish souls we may seem to trench on forbidden ground while treating of it at any time , and especially in a journal like this . The relations of man to woman and of woman to man may contain all that is healthful . Much of whatever is noble and beautiful in human existence depends upon and flows from them . Legitimately and temperately sustained , they tend to longer life and to better health in both sexes than celibacy can give . This assertion rests on scientific data , and no doubt ought to be entertained thereupon . But Jet any parties misuse these relations in unhallowed pleasureseeking , or even in lawful wedlock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them stalks boldly forth , . at times , consumption . In the yentable confessional so often met with in the career of a physician , we have bained ' proof perfectly satisfactory to us , that carelessness of hygienic laws in this respect , as in all others , tends inevitably to disease , and even death by consumption . We might speak of excesses in various other ways , such as overwork or its exact contras , t over-quietness , over anxiety in business , &amp;c. , as some of the more remote causes of consumption .. // But we forbear , and all that it is needful for us to say in conclusion is this , namely , any excess of whatever nature brings more or less disease as its necessary consequence , and with it may come con-. sumption at last to close the scene . We have thus run over , in a general way , the main causes of consumption as we believe them to exist in this country . Strictly speaking , however , any statement will be but an approximation towards the truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these above-named " causes " constantly and alone is the producer of the disease . They run over long spaces of time , insidiously working upon and vitiating the springs of health . Now one of them may be prominent , and again another ; and on still other occasions many of them may be combined . Imperfect as human beings are and always will be , no one , even with the best intentions , ever has been , or ever will be , immaculate or perfectly accurate in carrying out the best devised plan for procuring sturdy health . No one can feel more keenly than we do the imperfect nature of the sketches we have given . Nevertheless we give them , at the request of others , as the pith of our third of a century 's experience in professional life ; and , in what is called now the quaint style of the fathers of medicine , who wrote centuries ago , we humbly hope that God 's perennial blessing may go with them , as far as in them we have spoken the exact truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
