The letter of the Emperor of the French to the Sovereigns , inviting them to a Congress at Paris , has been published to day . It points out that , from the political condition of Europe , it impossible not to acknowledge that nearly everywhere the treaties of Vienna have been destroyed , modified , or misunderstood . The Emperor continues as follows : " We are threatened with a danger so much the more formidable because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people together by an identity of material Interests , wonla render a war still more destructive . Let us not wait before taking our ? part for sudden and irresistible events to disturb ' , our judgment , and draw us ( respite ourselves into a contrary direction . Called to the . throne by Providence and the will of the French people , bat trained in the school of adversity , it is perhaps : less allowable for me than any other to ignore the rights of sovereigns and the legitimate aspirations of people . Thus I am ready , without a preconceived system , to enter an international Congress with the spirit of moderation and justice , ordinarily the portion . of those who have endured so many various trials . If I take the initiative in this overture , I do not yield to an tinPulse of vanity , but because I am a sovereign , the most credited with ambitious projects , and ' 1 have got it at heart . to prove by a frank and loyal step that my sole object is to arrive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If this proposition be agreed to , I pray you to accept Paris as the place of meeting . Europe would perhaps see some advantage in the capital whence the signal for overthrow has so many times humeri , becoming the seat of conferences destined to lay the basis of a general pacification . " OPINIONS OF THE PRESS . The Paris Conatitutionnel of the 10th publishes an article signed by M. LimAYlisc , setting forth the questions which the Congress will have to examine , viz. : Poland , Schleswig , the East . &c.,; which may all lead to serious complications . All these are questions , says the Constitutionnel , in which France is not directly interested . Any refusal to settle them would not injure her honor or interest , but the general interest . If Europe continued to maintain the agitation caused oy the present precarious and painful state of things , the confidence of the people will show how to acquit France of responsibility . The correspondent of the London Post . under date of the 11th. says that the general impression at Paris is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 11th , says there is little necessity for an European Congress . With the exception of the annexation of Cracow , and one or- two transitions , every territorial or political change since 1815 ruts been recognized . As to the future , with such slight promises of success , or unallinlity , the Globe . hopes no hasty assent will be given to the Emperor 's proposal . A Congress unsuccessful would be little leas than mischievous . La France , of the 11th , says : " The information at present received continues to prove that the Powers are more and more favorably disposed to the idea of an European Congress . It is now possible to foresee ' that the greater number will be represented . " The English Cabinet held a meeting on the 10th , and were to assemble again on the Ilth to consider their answer to the Emperor 's invitation . According to the Paris Patrie , Russia , Italy and Spain had already sent in their adhesion to the proposed congress . The Court of Berlin had not yet arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
