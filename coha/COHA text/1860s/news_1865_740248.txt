txt By invitation of the faculty of Yale College , the members of the institute spent an hour or more this morning in visiting the Mineral Cabinet , Trumbull Gallery , and the New Hall and Library . The meeting was opened with prayer , at about 9:30 o'clock , by Dr. CuriturNes , President of Wesleyan University . The topic for discussion this forenoon was " Methhods of Presenting Moral Topics . " Dr. CUMMINGS , of Middletown , was first called upon to open the discussion . He expressed his satisfaction with the views , as presented by President WOOLSEY , last evening , indorsing them to the fullest extent . The difficulties connected with teaching religion and morality , growing out of political or partisan or sectarian feelings in a community , are such as to call for great skill and prudence on the part of the teacher . The propriety and necessity of this teaching can not be questioned ; and the modes of it =1st depend greatly ? more than other subjects  --  upon the teachers themselves . The applications of moral principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parallel , to answer the purpose in view . The first thing is to have right moral principles as to the relations of scholars among each other . There must be some great but simple principles of morals laid down as fully established . These must be familiarly discussed , and such personal applications made of them as grow out of the personal relations of the pupils to each other and the community . The speaker said he had no great faith in moral lectures . Written moral essays are well enough in their place , but they rarely have much influence on the conscience . There is a wide difference between lecturing and training on this as well as every other subject . That child who is really trained to the principles of honor and integrity , and fully appreciates the principles of integrity , can never go forth and become a corrupt politician , or engage in business controlled by false moral principles . Mr. C. F. Donn , of Granville Academy , N. V. , thought the controlling power of conscience must be educated mainly by school discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the playground . The child will not certainly know what is right in all cases instinctively . It is necessary to begin with simple , moral truths , and let him grow up from th-7 , se to those which arc more complex . Hon. NATTIAN H  --  DOE.S , of Newark , thought it practicable for every teacher to train his pupils in morals . It is a subject attended . with difficulties , but it has imperious claims upon every teacher who undertakes to mold the minds of immortal beings . No teacher can ignore it ; no Christian teacher can neglect it . Illustrating , in a manner , his own method , the speaker referred to the importance of inculcating truthfulness under all circumstances . He endeavored to impress on his boys the importance of truthfulness , so that there should be no doubt of the pupil 's word  --  no twist , no prevarication . On truth he would put honor , and on untruth dishonor . The first way to effect this is , for the teacher himself to be the personification of truth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his yea be yea and his nay , nay . Say nothing but what is to be law  --  nothing but what is true . Never disappoint a pupil ; never deceive a pupil ; never threaten and forget the threat ; never caution him and forget the caution . The teacher is the mainspring ; and , if he is sound , everything around him will move in order and regularity . That simple matter is what makes some of our schools places of order , study and moral growth : and others , on the contrary , that do not possess this principle of action , are but the vestibules of bedlam . Mr. HAMMOND , of Massachusetts . thought we had enough , and more than enough , of the preceptive in morals , in schools , if not from the pulpit and the press , but too little of the executive . In any family where you find two or three spoiled children , you will find them cased over with pure morality , that covers them as a garment , and-the conscience is not skin deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tender mother enough of talk ; it will be the purest kind of preceptive morality . There is something needed to go with it , and from the lack of the executive to go with it , it is an injury . There ought to be a clearer distinction between vices and crimes , and a better understanding pi the effect of vices as leading to what are called crimes . We are living at a time when there are vices right in our school-rooms . If we have laws against vice so perfect in their forms and theory as the Maine Law , for instance , that the friends of temperance are not willing to alter it , and perhaps can not , and when we have a state of things under it that the enemies of temperance are perfectly satisfied with , we are in a very bad position . Hon. J. WIIITE , Secretary of the Board of Education of Massachusetts , wished to call the attention of the institute away from the modes of teaching morality . He thought the teacher who came here and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for modes of teaching morality , had not the alphabet himself . It is the duty of the teacher to form the mode out of his own brain . There is no morality , which is the second table , that is not founded upon religion , the first table . If the plant of morality is to grow , you must sow seeds that will strike their roots deep into the subsoil of Christianity . This can be done in spite of sects and parties . Teachers should always trust their boys , and never speer about to see whether a boy is doing wrong ; never have a trap for a boy ; wear their heart s outside , as the soldier wears his badge . Show that you love the child , and teach morality - for his good , and no books will be needed to guide you . The discussion was continued by Mr. GREENLEAF , of Brooklyn , President COWLES , of Elmira College , New-York , Dr. THO3IPS011 , of New-York , and others . At 11 o'clock , President HAVEN , of the Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the subject of " The Indirect Benefits of School Education . " The lecture was a very able and interesting one , and was highly enjoyed by the institute .
