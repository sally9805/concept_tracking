TilE MECHANICAL TENDENCY IN MODERN SOCIETY . TmmE is no greater absurdity than the attempt to demonstrate anything from historical evidence , or to frame from it an argument whose cogency shall even approach to a demonstration . Granting the hypothesis that like causes will always produce like effects , we find ourselves unable to show that the cases are exactly , or even proximately , the same . History is not a record of every circumstance , but of those only that were deemed worthy of perpetuation ; and even were all circumstances known to us , we must ; receive them as seen through the opinions of the historian , while the present is as it seems to us ; so two cases , while appearing to agree , may in reality be very unlike . And , in addition to this , so many are the events that precede any given effect , that it is impossible to determine which is the cause , and which only the circumstance attending that cause . So , while our literature is flooded with so many demonstrations from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation of the sage who demonstrated that Tenterton steeple ' was the cause of Godwin Sands . ' From this it has arisen that practical men have come to despise not only all reasonings from history , but social science altogether , deeming it a pleasant tissue of thoughts that may amuse a leisure hour , but nothing of practical importance . On most subjects this is unfortunately true3 but sometimes in the state of a nation there are indications , repeated again and again , showing the existence of a cause which , unless counteracted , will eventually produce certain disastrous effects . Though seen and pointed out by many wise men , still the existence of the cause can not be logically proved , nor the time of its effect mathematically calculated . Such were the terrible premonitions which foretold the French Revolution , and such are the signs showing over and over again the existence of a mechanical tendency in our own social state . very seldom , almost never , do we have mathematical certainty as the ground of our action , but the greater part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though most of ourreasoning on this subject must be derived from history or social science , we deem it worthy of the same treatment that is given to other questions . If the probabilities be not as great , let it pass with other schemes and theories , but if those probabilities be great enough to make it of practical and vital importance , then let it become an element in every man 's consideration . There is a great deal of possible confusion in this word mechanical . To most readers it would bring the idea of invention , the increasing number of cotton mills and iron founderies , of steamships and power presses , and such progress would be considered in the highest degree praiseworthy ; but the sense in which we use the word is somewhat more general . A machine differs from a man in this respect : the former acts without intelligence and without volition , in acc3rdance with certain laws impressed upon it from without ; while a man chooses his own end by his own volition , in the light of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means for obtaining that end . A mechanical condition would therefore be one wherein an individual acts without intelligence or volition , according to * others ; a mechanjti*L ... *- ... one wherein the government moves on according to the will of one or more men , without thought , love , or even atsuch // a nation , hut only the fact that it has always been successful in preserving its liberties against invasion . The next is the age of leaders , when individual thought has so far departed that they begin to look to others , not yet as governors , but directors . This , to a superficial view the noblest age , marks the beginning of a decline . Its great power of invasion , as under Pericles or Cresar , comes from the fact that , while strength enough is hft to carry out the details , there is not enough of qwq tention f*m the mass of the people , content only with their acquiescence . On the other hand , a rational condition , both of society and of the individual , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and love of the individual gave strength and life to every act . The question whether our social state is becoming mechanical , losing personal thought and volition , is of great and vital importance , on account of the terrible major premise that lies beneath . For prove but once that this is the fact , // that lies beneath it , we come now to the all-important consideration , whether our own social state has this mechanical tendency . The preceding sketch not only shows the truth which we have deduced from it , that this tendency is a prelude to a nation 's death , but it also points out another , namely , that civilization contains within itself certain causes which finally work its destruction . We may , by a diligent study , find out these causes , such as increase of outward knowledge , division of labor , a complexity of outward relations , and a consequent hurried life that leaves no time for thought ; but a careful analysis of all these reduces them to one great cause - an undue attention to physical prosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bring about their destruction , but it possessed not a tithe of the universality and strength which it holds among the modern , for , whereas it was once individual , it is now national , pervading every part of the social state . Before the world was thickly settledand the nations established , it was held that the power of a nation consisted in the extent of its dominions , so that while the individual strove for wealth in agriculture , manufactures , or commerce , the state despised such low pursuits , and turned its attention to increase of territory . But when , after the fall of Rome , it was found that the earth was too fully peopled and national power too well established for such means of strength , attention was turned to another source of power in the cultivation of a people 's own resources and increase of its wealth . Wealth is obtained by the addition of mental power to physical products , increasing their value for supplying the wants of man . So that attention to physical comfort and prosperity which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading object of government : treaties are made , wars are declared , rebellions break out , not on account of national glory or right , but in consideration of cotton manufacture , facilities of commerce , or freedom of trade . Nations as well as men are absorbed in the same great pursuit , adding mind to matter for prod** of wealth . From this undue attention cal prosperity spring certain s* 4dinate causes , which , upon exan1in*t140h* are foun I to be the exact differentic* modern times . The characteristics which distinguish our age from all others are the very ones which have been found so de*-trnctive to prel3xistent civilizations . The first characteristic of this kind is the abundance of outward knowledge . In the pursuit of wealth , the ocean , the desert , the isles of the sea have been ransacked for corn modities to gratify the desires of man , and , in order that nature may be pliable for the same purpose in the hands of the artisan , its laws have been studied with the greatest success ; the bowels of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison of the arctic seas , have all been subject to the same strict scrutiny in this design . The knowledge thus obtained comes pouring in by lightning and steam , and is scattered over the world within the reach of the poorest by means of the printing press . The man of to-day is a citizen of the world ; he seems to be ubiquitous . It is as though he had a thousand eyes and ears , and , alas ! only one mind . Thought has two conditions : first , knowledge , as food and stimulus ; second , time for distributing and digesting that knowledge . But the first is so superabundantly fufilled that it entirely obliterates the second . Knowledge comes pouring in from all quarters so rapidly , that the man can hardly receive , much less arrange and think out , the enormous mass of facts daily accumulating upon him . The boasted age of printing presses and newspapers , of penny magazines , and penny cyclopamdias , is not necessarily the age of thought .

Wisdom is theory proved by experience , but here , alas I the reasoning man and the practical man are separated , so that we are farther than ever from the living truth . // Knowledge conies , but wisdom lingers , an d and the want soon returns : what the I linger on the shore , And the individual withers , and the world is more and more . ' Behind this first mistake , that one man can do the thinking for another , the great error in the world 's reasoning on this subject is this , that one man can perform another 's duties at all . The duty is his , the responsibility is his , and none can perform the one or assume the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the dynamical , the love and soul power which would make that logic effectual , can come only from each individual himself . The duty which each man owes to his children is education and training . Schools and teachers may supply schemes of education , improved methods of study , and instil some facts or even ideas into the mind ; but that which vivifies the intellect and brings out every power in its fullest development is the motive of love ; and it was meant that the filial affection of the child toward its parent should be the life of its opening mind . The mere logic of religion , Sunday schools and teachers , may supply one day out of seven ; but to animate that logic and make it a practical thing , a faith instead of a belief , it must be made concrete an ( i living in the loving life of home . In this case no one does the duty or assumes the responsibility of the parent . Our duty to our fellow men is not charity as we use the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subscription to a charitable society ; hut X*pLr , in the old meaning of love and help . Poverty springs from two causes-improvidence , a lack of the . savoir-faire in the affairs of life , or overwhelming circumstances , which have broken the spirit of the man and made him sit down discouraged and despairing . In either case , money is no remedy . If the man be improvident , it only helps the evil for a moment , man needs is instruction and care from those better versed in the art of living . And in the second case , to give money is no avail , but rather an evil ; for instead of thus recognizing his degradation , the man needs encouragement , the enthusiasm of a strong and successful heart , giving life and light to him who thus sits in darkness . This , demands the time and careful thought of every man , or the duty is left undone . Charitable institutions are well enough : the only error is in supposing that they can assume the responsibility of the individual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have left the other undone . ' Our country can not be left to politicians , for its first great demand is the careful thought of every man in the direction of its affairs ; and this , no single man or class of men can supply . The action of Government should be conditioned by the needs of the people , and these can be known only by the people themselves . It is for every man , therefore , to keep an earnest and heedful eye to his own needs and the wants of those about him , if the vo populi would be vex Dci , the utterance of God 's truth ; otherwise the opinion of the people will be the voice of demagogues , which is as far as possible from the voice of God . Another need is that of continual watchfulness , lest the country be defrauded , or its rulers become corrupt . No class of men can be appointed as watchmen , lest they also go in the same way ; but it is the unalienable duty of the whole people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really perform his duty by the payment of money or the providing of a substitute ; for that which makes a country strong is not armies or cannon , but life . The Moors held Grenada , in the midst of Spain , for years , the Swiss have remained amnid the storms of Europe for centuries , a Rome of huts went out to conquer the world , while a Rome of palaces is doomed to invasion and death . Every nation baa money // enough , if it have only patriotism and its attendant courage . Even if war has become mechanical and men fight at a distance , so that the courage of a hand to hand conflict is of no avail , it finally comes to the same result ; a nation needs not cannon or armies , hut men whose hands are strong and whose minds are qukk because of the love in their hearts . No man performs his duty unless he sends a substitute of equal bravery and patriotism to that which he should himself possess , and then he must do the substitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired soldiery can neither govern nor protect a country : it needs the people themselves as individuals . In religion , no man pretends to say that a class of men can perform the duty which each man owes to God , and the person who should say such a thing would he considered in jest or partially deranged . Yet it is so tacitly held , and practically believed . As the man sits in his cushioned seat on the Lord 's day , and looks up at the stately edifice which he has helped to build , and hears the eloquent words of the preacher whom he in part pays , he has a comfortable feeling that his work is done . To be sure , no man can love God without knowing Him , and none can know Him well without a careful and intelligent study of His works in creation and revelation ; but the man himself has no time for this , he has something else to do , and if he but hire another to dig out these truths , and present them to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he considers that itis enough . The preacher performs the thinking and the architect the acting of man 's duty to God . So the world goes on ; religion is merely logical , mechanical , a kind of greatest amount of happiness ' affair , a lubricant to make the wheels of society move on smoothly , instead of being from the soul , dynamical , giving love and life to the world . This mechanical tendency has also an element which makes it worse than any corresponding state in former times , for these at least contained a faith which was positive , while ours is utterly negative ; theirs sprang from want of mental power , ours from want of time . When in times past a people felt the power of thought going from them , and became conscious of their inability to solve the great riddle of life which was perplexing them , they chose the best remedy for what was irremediable , and turned to wiser men than they for direction and help . From thence sprang faith , reverence , hero worship , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we , having no time to attend to these things , have yet no faith in those to whom they are entrusted , and no hope of their successful issue ; we but shrug our shoulders at the thought , say , I can not attend to it , ' an d let it go . So laisser aller is the cry of the age , a dead negation of thought and volition . By proving the existence of the causes that produce it , we have sh*wn the presenco of a mechanical tendency in our social state ; the same thing may be done in another way , by proving the existence of effects that flow from it . The truest index of a people 's condition is found in the meaning which they attach to certain words . A history of the word virtus , manhood , is a history of the social condition of the Roman people . If , then , we find that the conceptions which we attach to such words as God , man , and society are mechanical , then society must have such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all government , all social movements , and all individual actions . First , the meaning of the word God . We , as a people , neither deny nor pretend to deny , in words , the existence of a Being , infinite in power and wisdom , who governs the universe according to his will ; yet practically we have ignored His existence , and deified the laws of nature instead , given up the idea of a free volition1 worshipping a // mechanical necessity of cause and effect . The cause of this dates back to Bacon 's Novum Organum , ' the introduction of the Inductive Philosophy . He laid down the principle that nature must be interrogated if she would be understood , that from a careful study of the effects we must deduce the cause , instead of presuming the cause , and explaining the effects on this hypothesis . This form of study and the study itself are well enough when confined to their right proportion ; but desire for wealth , in its endeavor to adapt nature to the wants of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deduced from it an untruth . In proving the being of a God from nature alone , we get only the idea of power joined to a dead necessity of laws ; and it must be in the study of the human soul , with its personality and volition , that we shall get the other ideas , which , joined to that of power , prove to us the being of a personal God . Nature has been studied and analyzed and searched with all the social and individual power of the age , while the science of mind and soul has stood still ; and so it is that men no longer believe there is any God but cause and effect ; not the nation which is right is successful , but God is always on the side which has the most cannon ; ' not the just man , but the shrewd man , will succeed ; not God but rain and sunshine , will bring forth the harvest . Give us back the time when men fought hand to hand in ordeal of battle , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm trust that God would defend the right ; give them back with all their superstitions and darkness , if with them we may receive again the lost knowledge of a God who is Our Father , ' a God who loves and protects His children . If there is anywhere on the earth a soul that trusts and prays , then must the world be wrong in its belief . A law is a rule of conduct , a law of nature is a 17w 3feckanical Tendency in ilfokrn Society . rule of God 's conduct , and though we have abstracted the personality and freedom , they are none the less there . There is also a mitigated form of this atheism as follows : many believe in a personal God , yet conceive Him to be fettered by his own laws ; as ifHe had made the machine of the universe , wound it up , and could now only stand helplessly aside to see it go . Prayer is of no avail to such a God ; thus the first need of the soul is left unsatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is their error : because He has always acted in this manner , they reason that He always will , and then go farther and think He always must ; not seeing how He stands behind and moves the law . When the hammer in the pianoforte rises , the wire will sound ; but there is one who sits unseen at the key board and controls the wires of the hammer . When the lightning bolt falls , the tree is shattered ; but God holds the lightning in His hands . Succeeding a mechanical idea of God , we have a similar idea of man . The fundamental question of human nature is that of free will or necessity . The history of philosophy is but a history of the conflict of these two ideas : in the life of the individual also , the same great question arises , whether the can be what he will , or will be what he must . From this come all those articles on Nature and Circumstances , ' Genius and Labor , ' with which college magazines are filled-endeavors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern society has declared itself on the side of necessity : while acknowledging man preeminently free in his relations to others , it yet considers him as the bondslave of motives . When God is the mere bondsman of necessity , and his religion only the means of the greatest amount of happiness , surely his creature must be in the same slavery . There are three great motives that sway men-love for themselves , love to others , and love to God . The first of these is measurable , // the others immeasurable . In the first , given a greater means of happiness , ten thousand dollars instead of nine thousand , and the action follows in that direction as a matter of necessity . But love of children , patriotism , benevolence , love of God rise above this logical and mechanical , to the region of free and incalculable volition . Society , ignoring any such thing as soul , has declared that only the measurable and necessary remains in man . Thence has arisen the science of averages , pretending to foretell with mathematical certainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also has arisen this maxim , so often quoted as final in all such questions , Every man has his price . ' Perhaps there is some ground too for this opinion . We have before shown how , by division of labor , affection and volition have been abstracted from life , while only a formal performance of duties by others remains , and it would be strange if , under such re*qirne , these parts of the human nature should not become shrunken . But the soul is not wholly gone yet ; the world is mistaken  --  a little is left which can not be measured by dollars and cents , enough of benevolence yet to make tolerable , enough of fait'li and love in the hearts of a few holy men to keep the world from corruption . Society was called by the Great Master a brotherhood . Even in heathen times men were held by ties of kindred and country ; now they acknowledge practically no bond but that of interest . The word that is continually in our mouths is framework of society , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a force from without , instead of being a living and vital thing , moved and governed by its own vital forces . Law of averages , ' honesty is the best policy , ' law of supply and demand , ' are supposed to be the forces that drive the affair , while any such power as love or faith is ignored . But as with individuals , so with society . The world is not so bad as it declares itself to be . Enough of patriotism is still left to affect the gold market at times , enough of faith to keep alive the effete aristocracy of Europe , enough of courage and honor to rally around and bravely uphold a tattered flag in a battle for constitutional freedom . Although we have shown the existence of a mechanical tendency , yet our labor is incomplete and practically useless unless we have shown how it may be retarded or wholly counterbalanced . Some countervailing element there must be , as is evident from the fact that , while the causes that produce this tendency exist in modern society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , yet their operation has been , by far , less rapid . Greece and Rome existed barely a thousand years , while Anglo-Saxon civilization has already flourished much longer than that , and as yet shows no signs of immediate decay . The retarding cause is war . This does not strike at the root of the matter and eradicate the love of physical prosperity , but only retards the movement , by awaking men to see that their interests are inseparable from those of the state . In the midst of war they see that one can not perform the duty of another , that hired soldiery can not protect a state , but their own hearts and arms must be enlisted unless they would be buried in its ruins . It wakes up the dormant dynamical powers of courage and heroism , and checks for a moment the selfish individualism that was taking the life from the nation . This only retards , it does not counterbalance or neutralize this tendency . War was common to ancient and modern times alike ; but that cause which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which we base our hope of an indestructible civilization , is the Christian religion . This strikes at the root of the matter , being antagonistic not only to the one simple cause , but to each of the subdordinate causes that 7 // are derived from it . Disproportionate attention to outward prosperity springs from the idea that the happiness of men and nations is inseparable from wealth . Directly opposed to this is the teaching of religion , that happiness and strength come from performing truly the duties of life . The first derivative cause which we found under this was an accumulation of facts which overburden the mind and destroy its power . Religion has little to do with outward facts , it taxes but little the receptive power ; it has to do rather with changing knowledge into wisdom , applying the few vital facts to the life . This knowledge , we have found , is objective , ignoring the PV&amp;OL o-*nvr*w ; but religious thought is intensely subjective ; all other things it esteems as of no avail , except those that relate to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to man an ( l God-this it continually demands . No man can be religious without thought-continual , earnest thought , perceiving and defining duties ; therefore , wherever religion comes , even the mind that was sunken in weakness is raised to renewed life . It is in this way that religion counterbalances the influence of division of labor . While this takes away the last incentive to thought on the part of the workman , degrading him to a cunning but expensive machine , religion gives to him a new spring of thought , vivifies his blunted mind by the power of transformed affections , and makes him again a man . The next derivative was lai*k of time , taking affection and volition from life by dividing the duties of the individual among others . In immediate antagonism to this , religion declares that the individual stands alone in his duties and responsibilities before God . It recognizes no institution of charity or social partition , but reiterates the command , Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself , ' which includes everything . Religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in its effects . It brings back to us the idea of a personal God . It makes no mention of nature , but simply says : The heavens declare the glory of God , ' He sendeth his rain on the just and the unjust . ' No laws of nature are spoken of as conditioning the action of God , but He sees the sparrow 's fall and provides for it ; He hears and answers the prayer of His children . It declares man to be more than a slave driven by motives , with every action necessitated ; it declares him a creature of free volition , whose action can neither be calculated nor controlled . It declares him possessed of powers of love and hate , which defy mathematics ; a being above all price , to whom honesty may be more than the best policy , ' even the loving obedience of a child to a loving Father . It declares society to be no mere framework tied together by interest , but a brotherhood , flke a living soul , having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of supply and demand , policy , interest , it enunciates but one word , love . It would be worse than useless if we had come so far in reasoning , and obtained no practical result , which might be embodied in each man 's action . We have shown the existence of this tendency , and the powers that are antagonistic to it . We can not prove the result , for there is no analogy in any preceding case which history affords ; we can not calculate the strength of the opposing powers , for the issue lies in man 's volition , which is above mathematics . Yet practically , the result , as far as regards us individually , is as valuable as though this were possible . The result depends upon the world 's decision , and each man is responsible for his part of that decision , whether he will give his heart to outward or inward prosperity .
