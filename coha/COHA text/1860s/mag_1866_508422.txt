r - -  - -  * - HENLY BAIITII , THE AFliICAN ThAVELETh IN the winter of 1859-60 I used to take the London Times every day from the hand of a gentleman who , like myself , used to read the papers at the well-known caf6 of Sparagnapaul , Under the Linden , in Berlin . The hour which suited our mutual convenience in going there was from twelve to one , and in time our passing salutations led to sentences , sentences to conversation , conversation to acquaintance , and acquaintance , I can not forhear to think , to friendship . This man was Henry Barth , the distinguished African explorer . He had just l ) uhlished his great work , and was quietly living in Berlin , waiting till some opening should present itself whiels should call his talents into occupation , and he worthy of his experience . A young man myself , his jnnior by ahont thirteen years , hut VOL . XXXILI. - No. 193. -E like him a pupil of Hitter , there were many things in common het*veen us , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most pleasant features of the winter . In person he was short , compactly and stoutly built ; with a nohie forehead , deep , dark eyes , regular features , and a hronzed complexion . He was in excellent condition ; yet full as was his face , and thick the solid coating of muscle which covered his cheek-hones , Barth had still so much mind , and so much sensibility , that what in many another man would have seemed like grossness , was entirely lost from sight in the thoroughly intellectual expression which played over his features . Most reserved in his conversation with Germans and with Englishmen , he was affable and confidential with an American ; and to me it is to this day an enigma when I hear naaav nAnin. // men use such expressions as this , that " Barth seemed the very incarnation of reserve . " Our Minister at the Court of Berlin , who was acquainted with Barth , has the same impression of his character which I gained years ago , and can not believe that the man whom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was he whom he found open , free , and kindly . Yet doubtless much is to he said on both sides . His whole early training tended to make him reserved and a lover of solitude , yet not suspicious and jealous . He never had a boyhood in the strict sense of the word : his earliest world was one of thought , hope , expectation , and study . He grew up without play-fellows , and with but few companions save books . In this way his taciturnity found a natural and inevitable development . Advancing years made him more and more a student . His ample pecuniary means allowed him , when he became a traveler , to journey with no companions but his servants , and what might , under other circumstances , have developed a rich , social nature , only proved the means of inducing an increase of reserve and taciturnity . Yet the suspiciousness which he manifested in his later years , was , so far as I can learn , a product of after-growth , and a result of disappointments and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only from one point of view  --  the bold , cheerful , undaunted African explorer ; and the man who encountered the obstacles which he did , and yet vanquished them all , would not seem to be the one to be the victim of disappointment . Yet he appears not to have led a bright , happy life . Among the rumors which have passed through the leading circles of Berlin society since his death is one which I never heard when he was alive-namely , that the direction of his energies to travel through wild and unknown districts was originally occasioned by disappointment in love , and as this is mentioned by scientific gentlemen of the highest eminence , it can not , I think , be devoid of truth . The lady to whom he was attached is said to be now residing in Berlin , happily and respectably married . But not to dwell on this romantic page of his career , which as only at best the record of rumors , there have been other agencies at work which have been effective in marring the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first great tour , of which I shall speak further on another page , Barth , laden with a traveler 's richest spoils , not mere light and pleasant sketches , hut with original results of great value , was appointed lecturer in the University of Berlin , and hoped to win a place not only in the affections of a large number of students , but also to realize his fond ideal of a successful teacher . In this he failed so signally as to embitter his spirits and crush his hopes . From his friend and my own , Professor Koner , of Berlin , I gather some particulars which , though stated with the caution and delicacy of friendship , make it cvident that Barth , though possessing some of the qualifications of a first-class lecturer , coeld not compete with others still more favored . He heaped up the masses of learning in such prodigious quantities that students who had not made geography a special study could follow him neither with profit nor pleasure . Large wallmaps not being used in the lecture-rooms of the University , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American lectur*r deal with descriptive geography without some help from wall-maps or illustrations ? Yet Barth 's want of success was necessarily sharply contrasted with the great and sustained enthusiasm which year after year attended the geographical lectures of Carl Ritter . Thirty years of labor in the Berlin University had brought him to the height of his reputation , and his lecture-room , the largest in the University , was always thronged . One might suppose that geography being brought into the foregro*ind by Hitter 's unparalleled skill , a young man , standing under his protection and enjoying his warm friendship and entire confidence , would have entered into a full share of success ; but this was denied to Barth , and , dissatisfied with his attempts to enlist the interest of the young men in his lectures , he began to look around him for a new field of exploration where his daring , his energy , and his hopefulness might have free play . But had he waited longer at Berlin , a happy , prosperous career might have been his in spite of early discouragements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so difficult for a young University teacher to gain a fair start as in Germany ; in no other country can success lead to such large and varied honors as there . Will the reader allow me to illustrate this remark for a moment , by a slight incident which I noted while in Heidelburg last summer . At the University there the oldest son of Mendelssohn was lecturing on the History of the Greek Revolution . He was said to be a young man of great learning , fine appearance , and of fiery enthusiasm . Being very much interested in the character of his father , the eminent musician , I availed myself of a spare hour to visit the University and hear one of his lectures . Arriving there , I inquired which was the number of the room where the young Doctor would read , and was directed to number eight . Looking in , I saw no one , and went out into the corridor , thinking that there must be a mistake . Encountering there a nervous , slightly-built , florid young man , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mendelssohn 's lectureroom , and was answered in the affirmative . Going in and waiting patiently for some five minutes , the door flew open as with a vigorous push , and the same young man entered , walked hastily up to the desk , flung a huge roll of manuscript down , and began to read a lecture with the greatest fire and rapidity . Two hearers came in after him , but as neither one took down notes in the universal manner of German students , I knew that they were casual listeners like myself . And thus he will go on year after // year till at length it may be the long practiced patience will have its reward , the lecture-room will begin to fill , the lecturer will be promoted to a professorship , and the honors which the world gives to a Neander , an Ewald , a Ritter , a Dove , an Encke , a Ranke , and a Rothe may be his . To secure this result Barth did not wait , hut turned his hack upon the lecture-room and chose the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African explorer . Yet the great disappointments which embittered his career were not all past even then . Not to dwell on the trials to which , like Livingstone and all great explorers , he was exposed while in the heart of Africa , there have been some within the last few years which would have pained a heart less sensitive than his . Coining home and publishing his great record of adventure and of discovery , he was not at once invited to take any important post , and when I met him in the winter of 1859-60 the future of his life was all uncertain . It was not till 1862 that two calls reached him which were sufficiently important to merit his serious consideration , one of them to the University of Jena , the other to become an Extraordinary Professor in that of Berlin . The latter was naturally more to his taste , since he enjoyed living in the Prussian capital , and he accepted it and entered anew upon those duties from which he once turned away for a more attractive field . Yet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African travels was not adapted to make him contented . Speaking the English language as perfectly as he did , it might be supposed that the country which he so faithfully served would have been anxious to retain his services and turn them to account but from England he received little or no displays of gratitude beyond the orders and medals which awaited him on his return . There was indeed no lack of recognition in the most prominent journals of the heroism which he displayed in his African tour , yet of that more satisfactory recognition which has followed the services of prominent Arctic adventurers , and such men as Livingstone , there has been none displayed in England toward Bath . The English could not forget that he was a German ; and the same petty jealousy which has been arrayed against the effort to reach the North Pole by way of the Spitzbergen seas , because it emanates from Pctermann , a German geographer , always refused to Barth the honors justly due him , and even ( Iowa to this moment no scientific or literary journal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact of his death . There was one cause more for the bitterness which has clouded Barth within the past few years : that was the bad spirit displayed toward him by the Anti-Slavery Society of England , and the persistent efforts made by its prominent members to show that he neglected the great object of the African mission . There is little doubt that Richardson , the head of the expedi tion until his premature death , was a man not scientifically qualified for his task , and not possessing that breadth and comprehensiveness of mind which were indispensable in one assuming the responsibility which he took upon himself ; yet he was a philanthropist , and the hope of making treaties and opening business relations was stimulated most largely in his bosom by the expectation that the greatest and noblest result of the mission would be the good effect which it would have upon the African slavetrade . But while it would be doing a grievous injustice to the memory of Barth to insinuate that he was indifferent to this infamous traffic , yet it must be confessed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mission as to forget the scientific objects in view , holding that it would be glory enough to open Africa to the enterprise and energy of the English nation , so that good men , clergymen and philanthropists , might enter in and turn the benefits of the original discoveries and commercial treaties to religious and beneficent uses . And when respectable men opened the fountains of their abuse after his return , and accused him of neglecting the philanthropic objects of the mission , Barth was most deeply wounded , and took no pains to conceal bow sorely it touched him . When be came home to Germany , the aged and venerable Carl Ritter went all the way from Berlin to Hamburg to greet him , and to escort him to the Prussian capital . The Royal Geographical Society received their returning member with great respect , and rose as one man when he entered the hall , while Ritter , the President , taking him hy the hand , escorted him to the chair , and introduced him to the enthusiastic assembly . But Barth had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The attacks which had been made by the English Anti-Slavery organ , seconded as they bad been by those of some of the minor ecclesiastical journals , that his mission had not been devoted to religious and philanthropic objects , pained him so deeply that the presentation of the Order of the Bath could not compensate for the wound . Tears filled his eyes as soon as he commenced speaking , and instead of relating what he had done , what be had seen , and how thrilled he was to be received like a returning prince and conqueror , be told the Society of the burden which oppressed him , and took away the joy of the hour . Barth undoubtedly overrated the importance of these attacks . He ascribed them to men of more influence than was just ; he supposed that they would injure his good name in England to an extent which was altogether impossible for them to do . Nor did he ever get over the wound . England became a different country , and the English a different people ; and the bitterness thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . It would not be right to omit briefly adverting to the fact that , in spite of his great learning , his ambition , and his achievements , be felt deeply pained at his exclusion from the Berlin // qwq perfected work as to he of great service to those who may have occasion to open the country explored by Barth and bring out its commercial relations with Europe ; and we have great reason to be thankful that , instead of leaving it in a heterogeneous state , unintelligible to any one but himself and utterly useless , therefore , in the event of his death , he worked it out clearly as far as he went , and left a large portion of it in a perfected state . Although I do not know just how complete he regarded it at the time of his death , yet I am sure that it was not left in the unfinished condition in which Buckle left the History of English Civilization , and Robinson his last work on the Holy Land , and that the disappointed hopes with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have been shared by Barth . Regarding the value of the last work of his life philologists , and those who may need to use it for practical purposes , are best competent to decide . But the eminent philological talents of Barth , and the unexampled opportunities which he had of acquiring the dialects of Northern Africa , make it certain that it will in coming years be regarded as of the utmost value . And here I can not refrain from alluding to his singular facility in learning languages . In addition to the African tongues , he had so intimate a knowledge of Greek and Latin that he might easily have taken the post of a professor in that department alone . Under Curtius , Bdckh , and Grimm he devoted the utmost attention to philology while a student in the University ; and the reports which he took down , German-student fashion , of the lectures which he heard , are the most thoroughly worked out of any that I have ever seen . The students always leave a broad margin at the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results of l ) rivate studies ; but it is no unfrequent thing to find that margin an unbroken blank . Aside from the ex4uisite neatness of Barth 's reports ( all now existing and in the possession of his friends ) the margin exhibits such conscientious and extended later study , as to make it plain that his was a most industrious University career . Only two great departments of study engrossed him-philology and geography . He paid some attention to the modern languages , particularly English ; and subsequently attained remarkable proficiency in our tongue . Indeed it may be remarked here as appropriately as any where , that he wrote his Travels not only in German but in English ; and no one who has read his volumes in our own tongue would suppose that they were written by one who labored under the great disadvantage of writing in a language to which he was not born . It is true he has not a lively , chatty , imaginative pen ; but he equally lacked this when he was writing qwq Some might do it out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number is not great who would have been willing to die rather than to counterfeit for a short time a false religious faith . But deceit , intrigue , false dealing , formed no part of the character of Barth . He could he curt and rough enough on occasion ; hut he could not find it in his heart to act a fraud . It is impossible to pass over the deeds of Barth in writing a sketch of the man and his career . Nor does the fact that the three bulky volumes of his work have passed into all the leading libraries of the United States , and have found their thousands and perhaps their ten thousands of readers , make such a work one of supererogation . It is now many years since those volumes were published , and the record of his adventurous travels may have faded a little with the lapse of time . But of course little can he done here but to give the briefest outline of his course , and to indicate in few words the value of his discoveries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great obligations to my friend , Professor Koner , the intimate companion of Barth , and the associate editor with him of the Zeitschr*ft der Allyemaeiaeu Erdkende . The working life of Barth divides itself into three great sections , entirely distinct from each other , and yet connected by a bond which it is not difficult to trace . He lived long enough to complete two fondly-cherished hopes ; and though the last work to which he laid his hand is left unfinished , yet it is so far advanced as to be of real service to the world . The goal of his youthful ambition was to make an exhaustive scientific tour around the Mediterranean Sea  --  the mother , as he thought , of all civilization . The hope of doing this was conceived by him during a journey to Italy while he was a student at the University of Berlin , and when he was twenty-one years of age . This was destined to be but partly accomplished when the proposed English expedition called him away , and he entered with the greatest alacrity and zeal upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This work was triumphantly carried through ; it was one of the few expeditions which have entirely satisfied the hopes of those who have attempted them . Returning to Berlin he began to take up the dropped stitches of the past , and to go on year by year with his exploration of the Mediterranean Basin  --  a task which he only completed in 1864 , about a year before his death . Besides this , he was in his later years devoting himself to the preparation of a Comparative Grammar of eight of the African languages , the result of his five years ' experience in the heart of that continent . Of that work two volumes // such as to make his decisions regarding the orthography of Eastern names of much value . Indeed the philological talents of Barth were so remarkable that , had he never been a traveler and a geographer , he would have risen to a very distinguished place among the students of language . No one could hear him speak English and not be convinced that the perfect manner in which he expressed himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcoming the great obstacles which a foreign language presents , such as hardly a contemporary professor in the University of Berlin had in so high a measure as himself . Ritter , whose library was more than half of English works , and whose connection with English geographers and travelers was most intimate , spoke English very imperfectly ; and even William Grimm , one of the first philologists of his day , and the conjoint author , with his brother , of the most elaborate dictionary ever prepared of any language , was entirely unable to speak an English sentence . Professor Neumann , the author of the German History of the United States , speaks with a marked accent and with a certain labored use of words ; Dr. Pertz , the Curator of the Royal Library , author of the celebrated Life of Stein , and husband successively of an American and an English lady , does not speak oar language with the fluency with which Barth found his way through those numerous idioms which distinguish our speech . This great proficiency can not be accounted for on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Richardson , the head of the expedition , and the only Englishman , was early removed by death , and Barth 's only companions subsequently to this were Overweg and Vogel . It can only be cxplained on the ground of his distinguished natural aptitude , which , if it had been confined to the sphere of philology , might not have made his name known as widely among general readers as his travels have done , but would have given him a place among the learned , not second to that of a Max Miiller , a Tischendorf ; or a Grimm . Let me now call the reader 's attention to the plan of travel which first fired the imagination of Barth , while he was a student at the University , and which was to be carried out , step by step , the accomplishment of it taking place but a year before his death . Very early in his career he became interested , through his delight and proficiency in classical studies , in the nations which flourished on the northern side of the Mediterranean Basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conceived the idea of examining in detail the entire coast land of that sea , the mother of all modern civilization . He had sat long enough at the feet of the great and noble Ritter to grasp his full and weighty teachings respecting the connection of the earth , its physical conditions , its contour , elevation , distribution of land , water , mountains , plains , and rivers , with the history and progress of the human race . From Ritter he unquestionably caught the conception of the immense historical value of the Mediterranean Basin , and the hope and purpose which dawned upon him on his first Italian tour may be traced back to Ritter 's crowded lecture-room in the University of Berlin . In some respects Barth was imperfectly prepared to enter upon travels so important and so little akin to a pleasure tour as were his . His close study of philology had precluded his paying attention to other sciences than Comparative Geography , and in the preface to his great work he has the courage and the honesty to declare , " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years he took the greatest pains to fill up , so far as he could , the deficiencies of his earlier years . Botany and zoology always lay outside of the circle of his studies , while in geology he became a tolerable proficient . It may be wondered at in these days that a great traveler and savant could be ignorant of these sciences ; but not to speak of the fact that the greatest American geographer of this age , Dr. Robinson , was no more of a geologist , botanist , and zoologist than was Barth , it must be remembered that what the latter lacked in those sciences he made up in others . He was an ethnographer and a philologist : in these two characters he was eminent ; and had he been more at home in the sciences named above than he was , it is confidently to be believed that he would never have accomplished the results ih ethuography and philology which , after all , were his highest achievements . I have already alluded to the kindling of his desire to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his first visit to Italy . To prepare himself for a work of the magnitude which he planned required no little time and pains . He could not be content with the st*udy of the languages and literatures of the two countries which had hitherto engrossed his attention , Greece and Italy . The Mediterranean had been the mother of many forms of civilization ; from its shores colonies had radiated , star-like , in all directions , penetrating Africa and Asia as well as Europe , and making a broad belt of culture around the blue waters of that beautiful sea . To understand all the languages related to a colonization so extensive and varied , to come into sympathy with all the types of national character involved , to understand the laws of progress and decline , was a work of time : and Barth supplementedthe eight busy months which he spent in Italy by three years just as busy in the University of Berlin , preparing himself for the great work of exploration which beckoned him on . He took his Doctor 's degree in 1844 , making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treating the subject with exhaustive learning , and producing a paper which a competent judge has declared worthy to be mentioned in connection with Heeren 's great work on the politics , commerce , and business of the ancient world . He commenced his journey in January , 1845 , // making London his first goal , where he spent two months in stndying the monuments of ancient art stored in the British Museum , and in acquiring the elements of Arahic . In England he had the good sense to provide himself with letters of introduction to most of the English consuls resident on the shores of the Mediterranean , . and at a later period he often had occasion to reap the benefit of his great precaution . He then passed rapidly southward , visiting Paris , the Rhone valley with its traces of Roman civilization , crossed the Pyrenees , spent a month in Madrid , examined the ruined fragments of Arabic culture in Southern Spain , and reached Gibraltar , where his true path of discovery hegan . He touched the African coast at Tangiers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moorish cities of Asila and El Arish , together with those of the Carthaginian colony of Lix . The suspiciousness of the natives prevented all attempts to penetrate into the interior , however ; and after trying all means to examine the Roman and Punic remains along the coast eastward , he was compelled to retrace his steps to Tangiers , recross the strait , to sail from Alicante in Spain to Algiers , and to make a fresh start . Yet he had seen enough of Morocco to become familiar with its physical features , the character of its population , and the general type of the archreological remains . Algeria was a little more accessible than Morocco , and Barth , with his natural energy and fearlessness , made the best use of every opportunity . To have penetrated far inland would have been to throw his life away , for although the French had had nominal possession of the country for fifteen years , yet it was only the coast which was quiet and secure . Barth could not leave the immediate neighborhood of the sea , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as Oran , examining among other remains the extensive ruins of Tipasa , the burial-place of the Mauritanian kings . He made excursions just as far inland as was safe , or indeed further , if the truth he told , visiting Philippeville , Constantine , and Gelma , and reaching the sea again at Bona , where he took a steamer for Tunis . In this state he had less difficulties to contend with , and made a thorough exploration of the country . He first visited the remains of Carthage and Utica , which had been brought to the light of the civilized world only twelve years before by the Danish consul Falbe. lie then explored almost every spot of antiquarian interest in the country , bringing to light a mass of information regarding ancient sites , which , if not of so thrilling moment as the discovery of Carthage and Utica , were by no means insignificant . No dangers of great magnitude had to be encountered ; and the Tunisian explorations which he made are among the most complete of his whole journey . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , returning then to Tunis once more , and continuing his successful explorations there . It was there that he heard a negro drop the words , " If it please God , you shall some day visit Kano . " They made a deep impression on him at the time ; and although crowded out of his mind hy subsequent events , they were not forgotten . They followed him , and rung in his ear till , in the course of years , he began to make his preparations to reach that far-distant African town , and fulfill the great mission of his life . Barth wished to go westward , to pass the Tunis frontier , and to visit the fruitful and wellwatered Bel*d el Jerid , but the inhospitable character of the natives compelled him to abandon this project , and to pursue his course eastward . Following the coast of the Minor Syrtis , and making such stay upon the route as enabled him to examine all places of antiquarian interest , he at length reached Tripoli , and tarried there for a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet he did not estimate sufficiently , as the sequel proved , the perils lying in the way . The route east of Tripoli was by no means of that savage , repulsive character which it is represented by the ancient writers . A shadow has rested upon the Magna and Minor Syrtis since the days of the Roman power , and it might well appall as brave a heart as that of Barth to face their dangers and their difficulties . Yet its natural character he did not find so markedly in contrast with the other districts which he had traversed , and he has strong words to bestow on the " lying poets " who have given the place its evil name . His journey over the Syrtis , and then through Cyrenaica , was one of the greatest archuological interest to him . Not to speak of Msarata , Kinyps , Ben-Ghazi , the ruins of Tancheira , Ptolemais , Barca , and Cyrene were places which had an indescribable attraction to him , and to them he devoted loving and patient attention . His arrival at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope of the high plateau which to the ancient world was the natural harrier between Libya and Asia , was characterized by an incident which changed all his plans , and cost him a large portion of the hardwon earnings of eleven such months as he had spent . It was on the 7th of June , 1846 , that , as he was lying exhausted in his tent , he was surrounded by a horde of the ruffianly Bedonins of that region , and in the scuffle that ensued he was wounded in the thigh . Victorious inthe first attack , and able to continue his march , he evaded for some time the balls which were shot at him from the covert ; but in a second attack he was rendered senseless by the blows of two stones which struck him on the head . While he lay in this condition the wretches who had assailed him rifled him of all his valuables and left him in the wilderness , destitute of water and of food . So complete was their spoliation of his effects that they took away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost the only article which was left was the clothing which he wore and his Herodotus , the faithful companion of all his subsequent travels . I have seen this // volume . It is not much soiled for a book which has passed around the Mediterranean , and spent five years of camp service in the heart of Africa . On the blank leaf he has written with his own hand in German : " This copy of Herodotus has accompanied me in all my earlier as well as in my later travels , having been left when I was robbed in Northern Africa , and having made with me my entire second tour . On this account , soiled as it is , it has its value to me . " I quote the inscription from memory , but its purport is as above . This was the real end of the journey . Accompanied by a friendly Arab he was at length able to reach Alexandria , having lost almost every thing which he had . brought along with him . Happily his very retentive memory stood him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written to his friends , and especially to Captain Schubert of Dresden , his brother-in-law , supplied the rest , and furnished him with the material of his first work , Ifonderunqen durch dIe Kiistealander des Mittebneeres ( Wanderings through the Countries bordering on the Mediterranean ) . The book is not a readable one . The accumulation of material in it is so great , and the lack of that point and vivacity which often make scientific travels interesting , has precluded the success of the work , and it has had no general acceptance even in Germany . Barth was as unlike as possible in bearing and look to those men of his country whom we generally have in mind when we speak of " German professors ; " but his books do not seem like those which would naturally emanate from the English-looking , stirring , vigorous man who is so well remembered in Berlin . Replenished by his father , a wealthy tradesman of Hamburg , with ample means he again set out anew , taking up the thread of his route where he dropped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thence he ascended the Nile to Assuan , whence he turned to the east and visited the ruins of Berenice , on the Red Sea , and the emerald mines at Kosser . He crossed the Gulf of Suez , and touched the soil of that peninsula so memorable for its connection with the children of Israel , although the harbor of Tor which he visited lay doubtless outside of the line of their wanderings . Thence he returned to Cairo , and then struck across the desert to Gaza , where he spent an entire month , studying the place with a critical care which had never been bestowed on it before , and practicing that dialect of the Arabic which he would be compelled to speak in Palestine . He then passed through many of the least explored valleys of the Holy Land , oftentimes facing dangers which Robinson did not wish to encounter . His most elaborate explorations were on the sea-coast , for he did not lose sight of the great goal of his travels , the investigation of the shores of the Mediterranean . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phmnicians were , of course , full of interest to him ; and although he was compelled to glean in the field which Robinson had carefully and almost exhaustively explored before him , yet the points which he noted* the corrections which he made , and the observations which he recorded , have a value which those can best estimate who have made that country the subject of special study . The quotations from Barth 's unpublished diary , which will be given in a few months to the American reader in the English edition of Ritter 's Palestine , will furnish convincing evidence of the thoroughness with which the accomplished and restless traveler studied whatever came within the range of his observation . The same spirit of scientific exploration with which he investigated Palestine he devoted to the ruins of Cilicia , the island of Cyprus , and indeed the whole southern coast of Asia Minor . After spending a short time in Smyrna to refresh himself , he passed northward through Lydia , the Trojan Plain , Mysia , and Bithynia to Constantinople , whence he returned to Hamburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three years , his constitution strengthened by exercise and exposure , and with perhaps the richest and most varied experiences that havQ been acquired by any traveler while engaged in a single journey . lie had in a certain manner accomplished what he proposed at the outset ; that is , he had encompassed the entire Mediterranean Basin , and was able to mentally review it in its wholeness . It is true there were many deficiencies to be supplied before he could be said to have thoroughly completed his investigations ; and he continued his journeys through Spain , Italy , Turkey , and Greece , down to the very year of . his death , although the distinct work which he proposed in his youth was completed in 1864 . The last of his journeys was during the summer of 1865 . It was made in Albania , and the account of it was published in the Geographical Journal , of which he was an associate editor , in the very month in which he died . Then followed the year and a half which ho spent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delivering those discouraging lectures in the University of Berlin to which reference has already been made . Restless , mortified , and ambitions , he began to look out on the world once more for a fresh field of exploration . The opportunity which he sought came sooner than he expected , and in a quarter toward which he would not naturally have looked . In 1848 James Richardson , who had already traveled considerably in Northern Africa , laid before the English Government the proposition that an exl ) edition be formed for the purpose of penetrating Central Africa as far as the kingdom of Bornon , and having as its double mission the abolishment of the slave traffic in that region and the opening of the district to commerce . The plan was approved , and Richardson was intrusted with the general control of such an expedition . Through the influence of the illustrious Bunsen , then the Prussian Minister toeEngland , and of my distinguished friend , the // geographer Petermann , then residing in London , it was thought advisable , on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholar to accompany the expedition , and , at the suggestion of Carl Ritter , Barth was selected for this important post ; and a more joyful welcome was perhaps never received than that which the young Doctor gave to the invitation . He had always been a great admirer of England , and to enlist in her service was scarcely less agreeable than it would have been to have been employed by Prussia ; and this cnn he said with the more assurance , in consideration of the fact that , although a German , he was not a Prussian by birth , but a citizen of the free city of Hamburg . Yet Barth declined the flattering invitation ; not assuredly out of timidity , or a love of home , or ease , or a disinclination to face the thousand difficulties which beset an explorer . His only motive was the filial deference be owed to his father , who strongly opposed his son 's going forth upon so ) erilous a service , and Dr. Overweg was selected to take his place and intrusted with the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government was so impressed with the peculiar value of Barth 's services that fie was unable to procure his release on the ground of his father 's disinclination to part with an only son . This being the case , and the son having accepted the l ) ost before consulting his father , and without a suspicion that the proposition would encounter opposition , nothing remained but for him to go . The whole history of that African expedition has been given so fully to the world that it is unnecessary to recount it in detail . It is safe to say that every one who may read this sketch has acquired his interest in Barth from the pages of that great five-volumed work in which the explorer had recounted his experiences with a too great minuteness indeed , and in a dry , nerveless manner , and yet not without finding thousands of readers . There is something so fascinating about the interior of that great unexplored Africti , that even the poorest record of travels there is not overlooked by the busy world . And so Barth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far read that the character of its author has been to a certain extent understood and prized . It would be an insult to the reader 's intelligence to do more than to give the slightest outline of his course . It is to be regretted that there was not in England and the United States an epitomized edition , similar to that published by Justus Perthes of Gotha , in two volumes , and like the larger one in five from Barth 's own hand . After a long and tedious preparation , Richardson , Barth , and Overweg met in Tropoli on the * Republished , complete in three volumes , by Harper and Brothers-Travels end Discoveries in North end Central Africa ; being a Journal of an Expedition vendettaken under the A wopices of H.

There being still delays , Barth , always restless if there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighboring country , visiting all the important Punic and Roman remains within a circuit of three or four hundred miles , and so consuming the time up to the 24th of March . The expedition struck across the upland of Sahara , and it is to their report that we owe our first accurate and scientifically valuable report of the physical character of that dreaded region . Like the Syrtis on the coast , Barth found that it was far more dreadful in anticipation than in reality ; and often afterward , when exposed to the fever climate of the south , and debilitated by the sultry air , he turned longing thoughts toward the breezy , dry , salubrious upland of Sahara . The type of human character he found much higher there than in the less elevated tropical district to which he subsequently came , and of the whole of the long journey , that which was taken through the ravines and over the crags of the " desert " was the most stimulating and enjoyable . It was at the arrival near the southern boundary of Sahara that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the fanatic Mohammedans which has been spoken of on another page , and which seems to have almost led to the destruction of the whole party . They had approached the kingdom of Ar , but it was only by the payment of two hundred dollars that they were allowed to enter it . On the 3d of September , 1850 , they set foot in Tintelust , the capital , and here the first commercial treaty made by the expedition was negotiated between the travelers , acting in the name of Great Britain and the Sultan of the country . During the stay which was made there , Barth , un*villing to be idle , pressed alone southward to Agades , and , after encountering no inconsiderable perils , succeeded in making a treaty with the Governor of this important commercial centre . He spent four weeks at Agades and then returned to Tintelust , enriched with knowledge of the country and the people , and having accomplished in a perfectly successful manner one of the great objects of the expedition . Leaving the Ar district the travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the German geographers call it , and here the party divided , each of the three taking a different route . It is not clear , either from the diary of Richardson or from the work of Barth , why this step was taken ; but it is probable that no single motive prompted it , and that it was brought about partly by the real want of unity in the counsels of Richardson and Barth , partly through a desire to accomplish more than could be done were a single route taken , and partly fl-em the fact that singly they could travel at less expense , because snore modestly and unpretentiously , than in a party . The last motive must have had considerable weight , for the funds were already beginning to be short . In the division of routes // Barth was to go by way of Katsena to Kano , Overweg to Geber and Maradi , and Richardson to Sinder . The rendezvous was to be in Kukana . Richardson , however , did not live to reach the place of meeting , and the three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too long a tale to follow Barth through the course of his wanderings , to see him in his rags , and destitute of money , enter Kano , the object of those long hopes which were awakened years before by that Tnnisian negro , who , on the occasion of his first visit to the African soil , whispered in his ear , " If God will , thou shalt one day see Kano . " The reader of Barth 's volames needs only to be reminded of the loan of twenty dollars on the part of the Governor , of his successful journey onward to Kukana , the place designated by the British Government as the goal of the expedition , of his entrance into Bornon , his protracted travels and investigations in that kingdom , of his extreme need of money and his consequent want , of his examination of Lake Tsad and the Adamawa district at the south . It was while Overweg was exploring the lake in detail that Barth made the discovery in the Adamawa country which was the most notable event of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he descried the upper course of the Benue , the stream which connects the heart of Africa with the Atlantic . The value of that discovery may not be known in our day , but the time will come when the words with which Barth alludes to his first view of the river will be recognized as no fanatic 's dream , but as those of a man who distinctly discerned the futore . " Whoever , " he writes , " has surren ( lered himself to the fancies of youth , and has gone forth in the pursuit of a golden hope , will easily be able to conceive of the feelings with which I looked over the field within my view . I was dumb with amazement . There , fresh from the creative hand of God , was a tract which should one day be alive with the industries of races of men as yet unknown there : a gateway was opened before me , through which the sturdy peoples of northern climes should enter and develop the riches of that fertile region . Little did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization , would anchor but a little way from the place where I then was . " Yet even now , although the Benue has been successfelly navigated to its upper waters , we are far from realizing the value of the great discovery of Barth . From that point he went southward as far as Yola , and thence turned back to Kukana , where he was obliged to tarry for a considerable time for the restoration of his health , which had suffered much under the trying influences of the African climate . He joined Overweg , and mate one journey more , traversing this time the hitherto unexplored kingdom of Bagirmi , at the capital of which , Masenna , he received a message from the English Government , placing him at the head of the expedition , and directing him to return by way of Timbuctoo . The order was highly welcome to Barth , and he set out with eagerness for the " Queen of the Desert , " as that barbaric capital is termed . While with his courage and unextinguished hopefulness he was congratulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the footsteps of the heroic Mungo Park , he had to bear the pain of losing his friend and companion Overweg , a victim to the relentless climate and to long-protracted fatigue . No one can paint the heaviness of heart with which Barth pursued his solitary journey , himself no longer strong , and liable to die at any time a solitary death . Passing Sinder , Katsena , and Sokoto , he crossed the Niger , and then followed the course of that river up to Timbuctoo , the goal of that stage of his journey . The story of his nine months ' detention in that city , of his imminent perils , and of his escape , is too well-known to my readers , and it forms a tale , even when told in his cold , dry way , of thrilling interest . To his dying day he never forgot the gratitude which he owed to the two youths who once saved his life at the peril of their own , and their picture , together with that of his great patron and friend , Bunsen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need not follow him down the Niger again to Sokoto , and through his homeward course over Kano and Kukana , where , at the very last stage of his wanderings and dangers , he encountered Vogel , who had been sent out to search for him as for a lost Franklin . The journey northward was uneventful , and on the 13th of October , 1855 , he arrived at Berlin . The results of the journey have been well summed up by his friend Koner in a few words . They were the discovery of the true physical character of the Sahara ; the establishing of the position and extent of the Mendif group ; the proving that the great eastern tributary of the Niger is independent of Lake Tsad , and that it forms the natural commercial avenue into Central Africa ; the investigation of the river system of Bagiri and Adamawa , and the exploration of the Niger between Sokoto and Timbuctoo . The aggregate length of his jonrneyiugs was not far from 14,000 miles , and the territory opened to the knowledge of the civilized world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The years immediately following Barth 's return were devoted to the preparation of his volumes for the press . Then followed a period of quiet study before he was called to any new field ; and at length , in 1863 , he was appointed Professor Extraordinary of Geography in the University of Berlin , in which capacity he labored down to the day of his death , November 25th of last year . It is painful to be called upon to record the death of one whom we have always associated with health , vigor , action . Of the sixty-seven travelers who have endeavored , since the year 1788 , to explore the region traversed by Barth , he is the only one who has been spared either a death by violence or by fever . Row narrow his // repeated escapes from both forms were the readers of his volumes know well . Yet he continued to the end a hale , vigorous man , and a slight form of dyspepsia was the only ailment which his African exposures bequeathed to him . An attack of this complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment which he received , was the immediate cause of his death . Notwithstanding the feeling in Berlin among his friends , in speaking of the administration of six grains of tartar emetic to a man suffering with a slight attack of dyspepsia , and the complaint made by some that he was no less than slaughtered by medical incapacity , it should he said , in justice , that Barth , whenever he was slightly ailing , always demanded a powerful , active , immediate remedy , and was not satisfied with light measures . Even in this the natural energy of the man appeared . To sum up his character is easy . Though reticent , he was not crooked , and his soul was clear and simple . He was a modest , resolute , straightforward man , a faithful and affectionate son , brother , and friend . He was a thorough student , and loved knowledge with the true German love , for its own sake , and not for the sake of what it would bring him . If he was harsh and severe in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too natural , as the opening pages of this article have , I trust , shown ; and very seldom did he allow his pen or his tongue to run away with his judgment . If a false man was to he shown up in his true colors none was more willing to do it than Barth , for his hatred of intrigue , of cunning , and of syco phancy was strong beyond all expression . He was all his life long free from care about money ; his first journey cost him about 11,000 American dollars ; but the sloth , want of ambition , and love of ease which often accompany the possession of wealth had no part in the character of Henry Barth . He had a few friends , and those few he loved with pure affection . He was a Liberal in politics , and a member of the Lower House of the Prussian Parliament . He was a friend of America , and with Americans he felt himself at home , for he knew that he was loved and honored in America . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , while he seemed to be in the very prime of life . He lived long enough , however , to do a great work and to win an enviable name . His memory will long survive in the hearts of those who knew him best ; and those who stood the nearest to him have only words of praise . He was not , it is true , one of those warm , magnetic souls which enkindle the enthusiasm of thousands ; his was not one of those tender spirits which draw men like the love of woman ; his was not a fine poetic nature , he not even having his full share of the universal , overflowing German sentiment ; but he had a manly , brave , genuine soul , a heart which craved the love of the few who formed the world of his affections , a noble heroism in the cause of science and civilization , a lofty , and I venture to say a sanctified , ambition . The world is richer for every man in it whose character has the sterling qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
