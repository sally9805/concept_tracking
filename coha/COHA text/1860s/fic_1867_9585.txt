( Still at window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought you said VAN DAM had failed ! RAY . Well , Yes . He failed to pay , but he continues to spend . PEARL . ( As if to those outside . ) Good night ! ( Response from without as sleigh bells jingle  --  " Good night . " ) I wish I was in there with you . It 's delightful for a sleigh ride , if it was n't New Year 's . O ! there 's DEMILT over ! ( Laughter outside  --  cracking of whips  --  RAY saunters up to window . Sleigh bells jingle , sleigh music heard to die away . RAY and PEARL wave their handkerchiefs . RAY comes down and sits C. ) PEARL . ( Closing lace curtains . ) Is n't it a frightful thing to be shut up here on such a beautiful night , and New Year 's of all others . Pshaw ! we 've had nothing but mopes all day . O , dear ! I hate mourning , though it does become me , and I hate everything but fun , larks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where in the world is Laura ? PEARL .

( Taking her hand . ) Well , if anybody in the world could make me forget her , it would be you . But if you had a lover , would n't you like him to be as constant as that ? PEARL . That 's quite another thing . RAY . But this does n't answer my question  --  Where is she ? PEARL . I sent for her as soon as I saw you coming . She has hardly been down here a moment all this evening . O , dear ! Now do n't you think I 'm a victim , to be cooped up in this way instead of receiving calls as we used to ? RAY . You forget that your mother died only last Summer . ( Rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pshaw ! You 're just like LAURA . She 's only my cousin , and yet she keeps always saying  --  " Poor aunt Mary ! let us not forget how she would have sorrowed for us . " RAY . ( Going towards back . ) Well , do n't you know she would , too ? PEARL . I do n't know anything about it . I was always at boarding school , and she only saw me once a year . LAURA was always at home , and it 's very different . But do n't let 's talk about it . To die  --  ugh ! I do n't want to die till I do n't want to live  --  and that 'll not be for a million of years . Come , tell me ,  --  where have you been to-day ? how many calls did you make ? ( Sitting in tete-a-tete . ) RAY . About sixty . PEARL . That all ? You 're lazy . DEMILT and WINDEL made a hundred and thirty , and they say that 's nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No . PEARL . Ai n't you hungry ? RAY . No ,  --  you torment . PEARL . O , dear ! I suppose it 's because you 're going to be married shortly to LAURA . If there 's one time that a man 's stupid to his friends , it 's when he 's going to be married shortly . Tell me whom you saw . ( RAY has sauntered off ( L. ) , and is looking over cards on table . ) Where are you ? Oh , you need n't be so impatient to see her . Do be agreeable ; sit here and tell me something funny , or I shall drop down and fall asleep . RAY . ( Over her shoulder . ) You witch ! Why did n't I fall in love with you ? PEARL . ( Laughing . ) I do n't know ; why did n't you ? RAY . You never keep me waiting . ( Listening off R. ) Ah , that 's her step ! No . PEARL . Do sit down . RAY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bore ; but as you and LAURA insisted I should go through it , I did . First I  --  ( Jumping up . ) I knew it was she . ( Goes to door , R. H. ; meets LAURA , who enters . ) How you did keep me waiting . ( Kisses both her hands . ) LAURA . And you , sir , we have been looking for you since eight o'clock . RAY . O , I was fulfilling your orders . I 've been engaged in the business of calling , from ten o'clock in the morning , till now  --  ( looks at watch  --  ) ten at night . LAURA . Well , you can make this your last one , for you have leave to spend a nice long hour chatting here before you go . Wo n't you have some supper ? ( Goes to bell . ) L. 2 E. on table . RAY . I do n't care if I do . I 'm rather famished . PEARL . Well , I declare ! Did LAURA bring your appetite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how it is , but she brings me a relish for everything in life , I believe . LAURA , I think if I were to lose you I 'd mope to death and starve to death . LAURA . Well , that 's as much as to say I 'm a sort of Life Pill . ( MARTIN enters door L. H. ) Supper . ( MARTIN exits . ) RAY . You may joke about it ,  --  but it 's so . You take the lounge . ( LAURA and PEARL sit on tete-a-tete . ) PEARL . You do n't want me to go away , do you ? ( Putting her head on LAURA 'S shoulder . ) LAURA . Certainly not . What an idea ! PEARL . I 'm sure you 'll have time enough to be alone , when you are married . And I do so want to talk and be talked to . LAURA . Well , Ray shall talk to you . PEARL . He was just going to tell me about his calls to-day . LAURA . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you call on every one we told you to . RAY . Every one . There was Miss  --  PEARL . Did you go to HENRIETTA LISTON 'S first ? RAY . Yes , and was n't she dressed . Speaking of dress , are you going to have your new pink for the Sociable , Tuesday ? LAURA . Yes , PEARL and I will do credit to the occasion , as it is our first for a year . RAY . ( Taking LAURA 'S hand . ) And our last . PEARL . Our last ! RAY . LAURA 'S and mine . For when we are married , you know , we shall be tabooed  --  where maids and bachelors only are permitted . PEARL . O bless me ! ( rising , ) How do you do Mrs. TRAFFORD . LAURA . ( rising ) ( sadly . ) I wish you had n't said that PEARL . You know the old Proverb : " Call a maid by a married name . " RAY . Nonsense ! ( Putting his arm about LAURA 'S @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 'll live long enough , you know . For nothing but death shall separate us . ( MARTIN appears at door L. ) PEARL . O here 's supper . MARTIN . Beg pardon Miss . LAURA . What 's the matter ? MARTIN . There 's a person below , Miss , who says he 's been sent with a bouquet for you , Miss , and must deliver it in person . LAURA . For me ? Whose servant is it ? MARTIN . I do n't know , Miss , he looks like one of those Soldier Messengers  --  red cap and all that . LAURA . Show him up here . Exit MARTIN , D. 2 E. L. PEARL . How romantic . So late at night . It 's a rival in disguise , RAY . ( MARTIN re-enters showing in SNORKEY , with an air of disdain , SNOR. has a large bouquet in his hand , and his hat is under the stump of his . right arm , which is cut off . ) LAURA . You wished to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss LAURA COURTLAND ? LAURA . Yes . SNORKEY . Then I was told to give you this . LAURA . ( Taking it from RAY , who has crossed L. C. and received it from SNORKEY . ) By whom ? SNORKEY . Now that 's what I do n't know myself ! You see I was down by the steps of the Fifth Avenue Hotel , taking a light supper off a small toothpick , when a big chap dressed in black came by , and say 's he : " Hallo , come with me if you want to earn a quarter . " That ( confidentially to all ) being my very frame of mind , I went up one street and down another , till we came here . " Just you take this up there " says he , " and ask for Miss LAURA COURTLAND , and give it to her and no one else . " LAURA . It is some folly of our late visitors . SNORKEY . I 'm one of the Soldier Messengers , Miss . We take to it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uncle Sam 's service . RAY . ( As SNOR. is going L. ) Stop a moment , my man . Were you not one of the Twenty-second 's recruits . SNORKEY . Yes , Captain ; I remember you joined us in New York , and left us at Washington . Real fighting was n't funny you thought , and I began to think so too at Fredericksburg . RAY . Poor devil . SNORKEY . There was a South Carolina gentleman took such a fancy to me at Fredericksburg ! Would n't have no denial ,  --  cut off my arm to remember me by ; he was very fond of me . I was n't any use to Uncle Sam then , so I came home , put a red band round my blue cap , and with my empty sleeve , as a character from my last place , set up for light porter and general messenger . All orders executed with neatness and dispatch . PEARL . And Uncle Sam has forgotten you . SNORKEY . Ah ! Miss , do n't blame Uncle Sam for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after , I ca n't find fault if he do n't happen to remember all us poor stumps of fellows . RAY . ( L. H. ) So it seems . LAURA . ( C. ) ( PEARL takes bouquet . ) Poor fellow ! ( To servant . ) MARTIN , be sure and give him a glass of wine before he goes . SNORKEY . ( L. C. ) I 'm much obliged , Miss  --  but I do n't think it would be good for me on an empty stomach  --  after fasting all day . LAURA . Well , MARTIN shall find you some supper , too . SNORKEY . Is this MARTIN ? What a nice young man . May n't he have a drop of something , too ? He must have caught cold letting me in , he has got such a dreadful stiffness in the back of his neck . MARTIN exit . RAY . ( Giving penciled address . ) Call on me at this place to-morrow , and you sha n't regret it . SNORKEY . All right , Cap'n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and promotion . Ladies , if ever either of you should want a Light Porter , think of JOE SNORKEY  --  wages no objection . Exit L. H. door . PEARL . ( C. ) ( Who has been examining the bouquet . ) O ! Laura , only look  --  here 's a billet-doux ! RAY . Nonsense ! Crazy head ! Who would dare ( takes bouquet )  --  a letter ! ( Takes a paper from bouquet . ) LAURA . A letter ? PEARL . I am crazy  --  am I ? RAY . ( Reads superscription . ) " For Miss LAURA COURTLAND . Confidential . " LAURA . ( Laughs . ) Ha ! Ha ! from some goose who has made one call too many to-day . Read it , RAY  --  ( Offering letter . ) RAY . " Dear LAURA  --  ( Refusing the letter , and going to PEARL . ) LAURA . ( Looks at it a moment , when the whole expression of face changes . Then reads slowly and deliberately . RAY down R. C. with PEARL . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of an interview to-night . I have waited until your company retired . I am waiting across the street , now . " PEARL . ( Runs to window . ) A tall man in black is just walking away . LAURA . " If you will have the door opened as soon as you get this , I will step over ; if you do n't , I will ring ; under all circumstances I will get in . There is no need to sign my name ; you will remember me as the strange man whom you once saw talking with your mother in the parlor , and who frightened you so much . " What can be the meaning of this ?  --  PEARL  --  no  --  ( goes to bell on table L. H. , and rings . ) RAY . LAURA , you  --  LAURA . Ask me nothing . I will tell you by-and-bye . Enter MARTIN , L. door MARTIN . Missit  --  LAURA . Admit no one till you bring me the name . MARTIN . I was about to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in at the door and asks to see you , but will give no name . RAY . Kick the rascal out ! Cross to L. PEARL . Oh ! do n't let him come here . MARTIN . He 's a very strange-looking person , Miss . RAY . I 'll find out what this means ! ( Is going to door L. , when BYKE appears at it smiling and bowing . ) BYKE . ( L. H. ) I 'll spare you the trouble , if you 'll hear me a minute . RAY . ( L. C. ) ( violently ) Who are you , fellow ? BYKE . Do n't , I beg of you . Do n't speak so crossly ; I might answer back  --  then you 'd kick me out  --  and you 'd never forgive yourself for it as long as I lived . RAY . Your business ? Come ! Speak quickly and begone . BYKE . ( Coming down L. ) Business ! on this happy day ! I came for pleasure  --  to see Miss COURTLAND , my little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew her when she was only a little child . I taught her music  --  she was so musical  --  and so beautiful  --  I adored her , and her mother told me I need n't come again  --  But I did  --  and her mother was glad to see me . Was n't she , little pupil ?  --  ( to LAURA , who is pale with terror , leaning on PEARL . RAY C. , BYKE L. )  --  and begged me to stay  --  but I said no  --  I 'd call occasionally  --  to see my dear little pupil , and to receive any trifling contribution her mother might give me . Wo n't you shake hands , little pupil ? ( Advances suddenly , when RAY grasps him by the collar  --  BYKE glares at him a moment . Then quickly , as before . ) Do n't ! please , do n't ! The stuff is old , and I 've no other . RAY . The fellow 's drunk ! Leave the house ! BYKE . What ! after sending that touching bouquet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . BYKE . You see she knows me . Ah ! memory how it blooms again where the plough of time has passed . LAURA . Leave this house at once . BYKE . Not until I have spoken with you . RAY . ( Seizing him . ) You miserable rascal . BYKE . Do n't , pray do n't ! I weigh a hundred and ninety eight pounds , and if you attempt to throw me about you 'll strain yourself . LAURA . ( Crossing . ) Go . To-morrow in the morning I will see you . BYKE . Thanks ! I thank you , Miss , for your forbearance . ( To RAY . ) I am also obliged to you sir , for not throwing me out at the window . I am indeed . I wish you good night , and many happy returns of the day . ( Bows , and turns to go . Then familiarly to servant . ) Many calls to-day , John ? Exit L. RAY . ( Runs to LAURA , who is pale . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he goes . Exit RAY , L. door . LAURA . ( Taking both of PEARL 'S hands in her own . ) PEARL , he must know everything . PEARL . O , dear ! this is dreadful ! I do hate scenes . LAURA . He must know everything , I tell you ; and you must relate all . He will question  --  he will ponder  --  leave him nothing to ask . PEARL . If you wish it , but  --  LAURA . I desire it ; speak of me as you will  --  but tell him the truth . ( RAY enters hastily , L. ) Stay with her . Do n't follow me . Exit . R. RAY . ( Down , R. H. ) PEARL , What does this mean . PEARL . O , its only a little cloud that I want to clear up for you . RAY . Cloud  --  how ? where ? PEARL . Do n't I tell you I 'm going to tell you . Sit down here by me . ( She sinks into tete-a-tete . C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew her . And she gave him an interview for to-morrow . That drunken wretch  --  PEARL . Do sit down . I can never speak while you are walking about so . ( Gets up , brings him to chair , R. H. and makes him sit . ) Sit by me , wo n't you ? for I 've got something strange to tell you . RAY . You serious ! I 'd as soon expect to see the lightning tamed . Well , I listen . PEARL I have something to say to you , RAY , which you must settle with your own heart . You love LAURA , do you not ? RAY . PEARL I do more , I adore her . I adore the very air that she breathes . I will never be happy without her . I can swear that . PEARL . LAURA is twenty now . How do you think she looked when I first saw her ? RAY . Were you at home when she first came into this earthly sphere ? PEARL . Yes . RAY . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . PEARL . She was covered with rags , barefooted , unkempt , crying and six years old . RAY . ( Shocked . ) Explain . PEARL . One night father and mother were going to the Opera . When they were crossing Broadway , the usual crowd of children accosted them for alms . As mother felt in her pocket for some change , her fingers touched a cold and trembling hand which had clutched her purse . RAY . A pickpocket ! Well . PEARL . This hand my mother grasped in her own , and so tightly that a small , feeble voice uttered an exclamation of pain . Mother looked down , and there beside her was a little ragged girl . RAY . The thief . PEARL Yes , but a thief hardly six years old , with a face like an angel 's . " Stop ! " said my mother . " What are you doing ? " " Trying to steal , " said the child . " Do n't you know that it 's wicked to do so ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but it 's dreadful to be hungry . " " Who told you to steal ? " asked my mother . " She ,  --  There ? " said the child , pointing to a squalid woman in a doorway opposite , who fled suddenly down the street . " That is OLD JUDAS , " said the girl . RAY . Old JUDAS  --  What a name ! But how does this story interest us ? PEARL . This child was Laura . My father was about to let her go  --  unharmed  --  but my mother said " No , it is not enough . We have a duty to perform , even to her , " and acting on a sudden impulse took her to our home . On being questioned there , the child seemed to have no recollection , save of misery and blows . My mother persuaded father , and the girl was sent to a country clergyman 's for instruction , and there she remained for several years . RAY . PEARL , your are joking with me . PEARL . In beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named her ) , exceeded every girl of her age . In gratitude she was all that father could have wished . She was introduced , as you know , into society as my cousin , and no one dreams of her origin . RAY . ( Starting up . ) LAURA , an outcast  --  a thief ! PEARL ( Rising . ) No , that is what she might have been . RAY . And this man  --  to-night . PEARL . All I know about him is that four years ago this man came with a cruel-looking woman , to see mother . There was a fearful scene between them , for LAURA and I sat trembling on the stairs , and overheard some awful words . At last they went away , the man putting money into his pocket as he left . RAY . But who were they ? PEARL . LAURA never told me , and mother would not . But of course they must have been LAURA 'S father and mother . ( RAY sinks on chair , as if overcome ) . PEARL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you would have known nothing had not LAURA made me speak . You see , she would not conceal anything from you . ( Going to him . ) RAY , why do n't you speak  --  shall I go after LAURA ? Shall I tell her to come to you ? Why do n't you answer ? ( Going . ) I 'll go and tell her you want to see her . ( Pausing as she goes R. ) I 'm going to send her to you , RAY . Goes off R. still looking back at him . RAY . ( Starting up . ) What a frightful story . LAURA COURTLAND a thief ! A drunken wretch who knows her history , and a squalid beggar woman who can claim her at any moment as their child . And I was about to marry her . Yes , and I love her . But what would my mother think ? My friends ? Society ? No  --  no  --  no  --  I can not think of it . I will write her  --  I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not wed her now ! ( Goes to the table L. U. E. ) Here is paper . ( Sits . ) What am I about to do ? What will be said of me ? But I owe a duty to myself  --  to society  --  I must perform it . ( Writes . ) " LAURA , I have heard of all from your sister . " What have I said  --  ( crosses out last word )  --  " from PEARL . You know that I love you , but my mother will demand of me a wife who will not blush to own her kindred , and who is not the daughter of obscurity and crime . " It is just ; it is I who have been deceived . ( Folds letter and addresses it ) I will leave it for her . ( Puts on light overcoat , which hangs on chair at back ) . I must go before she returns . Her step  --  too late ! ( Crams the letter into pocket of overcoat . LAURA enter R. H. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss  --  Miss COURTLAND . ( LAURA looks at him a moment , smiles , and then crosses C. without further noticing him , and sits down on tete-a-tete . ) What have I said ? What ought I have said ? ( He takes a step towards her  --  she rises , without looking at him goes to window  --  looks out , then looks over books on table R. H. RAY . LAURA  --  I  --  LAURA . Pshaw , where is my book ? RAY . What book do you want , LAURA ? LAURA . Sir . RAY ( repulsed ) . Oh !  --  ( pause )  --  I 've been a fool . How lovely she looks . ( He follows her mechanically to table L. ) Can I find it for you ? LAURA picks up a book and reseats herself C. LAURA Do n't trouble yourself , I beg . RAY . ( Coming forward and leaning over her seat . ) LAURA . LAURA . ( Without lifting her head ) Well . RAY . ( Toying with her hair . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full at him . ) RAY . No , no , not that way ; as you used to . You act as if I were a stranger . LAURA . They are only strangers who call me Miss COURTLAND . ( Resumes reading . ) RAY . Forgive me , I beg you to forgive me . ( Coming round and sitting beside her . ) I was mad  --  it was so sudden  --  this miserable story  --  but I do n't care what they say . O ! do listen to me . I thought you hated reading . LAURA . I often wish that I were ugly , wretched , and repulsive like the heroine in this story . ( Seats herself . ) RAY . ( Behind her . ) Why ? LAURA . Because then I could tell who really loved me . RAY . And do n't you know ? LAURA . No ; I do not . RAY . Well , I know . LAURA . Do tell me then , please . RAY . He has told you so himself , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAURA . ( Laughing heartily at him , then seriously . ) How happy must those women be , who are poor and friendless and plain , when some true heart comes and says : I wish to marry you ? RAY . LAURA you act very strangely to-night . LAURA . Will you put this book away ? RAY . ( Throws it on table . ) There LAURA . ( Seats himself beside her . ) LAURA . ( Rising . ) There 's PEARL calling me . RAY . ( Rising and taking her hand . ) LAURA , why do n't you let me speak to you . LAURA . About what ? RAY . About my love . LAURA . For whom ? Not me . This is only marriage and giving in marriage . I hate the very word . RAY . You did not think so once . LAURA . I wish I had . I am frightened now , I begin to understand myself better . RAY . And I am frightened because I understand you less . LAURA . Do not try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by door as she is going out , ) good night Mr. TRAFFORD . ( Exit laughing , R. 2 E. ) RAY . I 've been an ass . No , I wrong that noble animal . The ass recognized the angel , and I , like Balaam , was blind . But I see now . After all what have I to fear . ( Takes letter from pocket . ) No one knows of this , ( puts it in his pocket again . ) Let things go on ; we 'll be married , go straight to Europe , and live there ten years . That 's the way we 'll fix it . ( Exit L. 2 E. Scene closes in . ) SCENE II . ( 1st Grooves. )  --  The Gentlemen 's coat-room at DELMONICO 'S opening ( C. ) for hat and coat . Chairs ( L.

We 've made it all up But what on earth keeps her to-night ? It 's eleven already . ( Looking at watch ) Confound it , I tremble every moment she 's out of my sight . I fear that terrible man and his secret . MRS . V. D. Mrs. Van Dam ( Coming up with DEMILT . ) TRAFFORD , you look very uneasy What 's the matter ? RAY . O , nothing , I think I ought to go for LAURA . I will , too . ( Servant passes at lack . ) Here ! go up-stairs for my overcoat , ( Gives the man a card , and he goes out . ) MRS . V. D. Mrs. Van Dam Nonsense ! She 'll be here in good time , You sha n't leave us . Hold him , PEARL . We want a nine-pin quadrille ; we have n't half enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers are always afraid some one will carry your girls away . RAY . ( uneasy . ) I ? I 'm not afraid . PEARL . Come , come ! I never saw such a restless fellow . ( SERVANT enters with coat , C. ) SERVANT . Here 's your coat , sir . MRS . VAN D. Give it to me . I 'm determined you sha n't go . ( Takes coat carelessly ) I 'll make you a promise  --  if LAURA is n't here in fifteen minutes you shall have your coat , and may go for her . RAY . Well , I suppose I 'll have to wait . MRS . VAN D. There ; take him off , PEARL . ( RAY goes up with PEARL . ) To SERVANT ) Here , take this back . ( Flings coat to SERVANT . As she does so , letters drop from it . ) Well , there 's a mess ! ( SUE EARLIE and another lady run forward and pick up letters . ) Love letters , of course !  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EARLIE . Here 's one for LAURA . It 's unsealed and not delivered . MRS . VAN D ( Tremolo waltz music . ) A fair prize ! Let 's see it . ( Music . Takes and opens it . Puts on eye-glass and reads . ) " Laura "  --  Well , come ! That 's cool for a lover . " I have heard all from "  --  something scratched out  --  ah !  --  " your sister , PEARL  --  Your obscure origin  --  terrible family connexions  --  the secret of the tie which binds you to a drunken wretch  --  My mother , Society  --  will demand of me a wife who will not blush to own her kindred ,  --  or start at the name of outcast and thief ! " Signed , RAY TRAFFORD . ( All stand speechless and look at each other . All this time the rest have been dancing . ) SUE EARLIE . What can it mean ? MRS . VAN D. It means that the rumors of ten years ago are proven . It was then suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some unnamed place in the country , and introduced to everybody as her niece , was an imposter , which that foolish woman , in a freak of generosity , was thrusting upon society . The rumors died out for want of proof  --  and before LAURA 'S beauty and dignity  --  but now they are confirmed . She is some beggar 's child . SUE EARLIE . What do you think we ought to do ? ( TRAFFORD surrenders PEARL to DEMILT , and comes down . ) MRS . VAN D. Tell it  --  tell it everywhere , of course . The best blood of New York is insulted by that girl 's presence . ( TRAFFORD coming down . ) RAY . ( R. H. ) What have you three girls got your heads together for ?  --  Some conspiracy , I know . MRS . VAN D. ( To ladies . ) Go , girls  --  tell it everywhere . RAY . ( As the ladies distribute themselves about the groups . ) What is it all about ? Your face is like a portrait of mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at this , and tell me what it means . RAY . ( Quickly . ) Where did you get this ? MRS . VAN D. It is you who must answer  --  and Society that will question . So LAURA is not a COURTLAND . RAY . ( Overcome ) You know , then  --  MRS . VAN D. Everything ; and will you marry this creature ? You can not . Society will not permit your sacrifice . RAY . This is not your business . Give me that letter . MRS . VAN D. Certainly ; take it . But let me say one word ,  --  its contents are known . In an hour every tongue will question you about this secret ,  --  every eye will inquire . RAY . I implore you ! Do not breathe a word for her sake . ( She turns scornfully away . ) MRS VAN D. The secret 's not mine . RAY . Who knows it ? MRS . VAN D. Look ! ( Points to others who are grouped about whispering and motioning towards RAY . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gents L. C. ) RAY . ( Wildly . ) What will they do ? MRS . VAN D. Expose her ! Expel her from Society in which she is an intruder ! RAY . You dare not ! PEARL comes forward L. PEARL . O , RAY ! What Is the meaning of this ? RAY . ( Bitterly . ) It means that Society is a terrible avenger of insult . Have you ever heard of the Siberian wolves ? When one of the pack falls through weakness , the others devour him . It is not an elegant comparison  --  but there is something wolfish in society . LAURA has mocked it with a pretence , and Society , which is made up of pretences , will bitterly resent the mockery . MRS . VAN D. Very good ! This handsome thief has stolen your breeding as well as your brains , I see . RAY . If you speak a word against her , I will say that what you utter is a lie ! MRS . VAN D. As you please , we will be silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forcibly when it utters no sound . PEARL . O , go and prevent her coming here . RAY .

They are no longer safe when such an accomplished thief enters . ( Music low as LAURA enters , continues while all except PEARL and RAY pass out , eyeing her superciliously . LAURA C. PEARL R. ) PEARL . O RAY , RAY , why do you not come to her ? MRS . VAN D. ( Up C. of stage , surrounded by others . ) Are you not coming with us TRAFFORD . PEARL . ( To LAURA . ) Let us go home .

SONG  --  PEACH : A lordly knight and a lovely dame , were walking in the meadow , But a jealous rival creeping came a-watching in the shadow ; They heeded not , but he whet his knife and dogg 'd them in the shadow . The knight was brave , and the dame was true , the rival fared but badly ; For the knight he drew and ran him through , and left him groaning sadly ; The knight and dame soon wedded were , with bells a-chiming gladly .

Miss NINA is the only friend ever had , since I ran away from MOTHER JUDAS . I wonder where old JUDAS is now ? I know she 's drunk ; she always was ; perhaps that 's why she never tried to find out what became of me . If she did she could not take me away . Miss NINA begged me off a policeman . I belong to her . I wonder why she ai n't got any other friends ? She 's awful mysterious . Tells me never to let any strangers see her . She 's afraid of somebody , I know . It looks just as if she was hiding . I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide . If I was good and pretty like her , I would n't hide from the President .

PEACH . Oh , oh ! please do n't beat me . I ai n't good I 'm only trying to be . JUDAS . Your only trying to be , eh ? Trying to be good , and here 's me as was a-weeping every night , thinking as you was sent up for six months . Who 're you living with  --  you ai n't a-keeping house , are you ? PEACH . I 'm living with Miss NINA . JUDAS . NINA , what 's she , concert-saloon girl ? PEACH . No , she 's a lady . JUDAS . A lady  --  and have such baggage as you about .

PEACH . No , she 's poor . JUDAS Any nice clothes ? PEACH . O , she 's got good clothes . JUDAS . Where are they ? PEACH . Locked up , and she 's got the key . JUDAS . You 're lying , I see it in your eye . You 're always shame-faced when you are telling the truth , and now you 're as bold as brass . Where 's my shoe ? ( making a dash at her ) . PEACH ( shouting . ) There 's Miss NINA ( as if curtseying to some one behind JUDAS ) Good morning , miss . JUDAS . ( Changing her tone . ) Ah ! my pretty dear ! What a good lady to take you in and give you a home . ( Turns and discovers the deception  --  in a rage . ) You hussy , ( PEACH retreats ) wait till I get you in my clutches again , my lady ; and it wo n't be long .

Beg pardon , Miss , I just called to see if you had any old clothes you 'd like to exchange . LAURA . No , I do n't want anything , my good woman . JUDAS .

No , only a circular " To the lady of this house . " What 's that I ( Starting ) only BLOSSOM sweeping . Every time there is a noise I dread the entrance of some one that knows me . But they could never find me in New York , I left them all too secretly and suddenly . None of them can suspect I would have descended to this . But it is natural , everything will find its level .

Beefsteak , ' m . Let 's have some leg o'mutton to-day . We 've never had that . LAURA . But I do n't know how to cook it . Do you ? PEACH . No , but I 'd just slap it on , and it 's sure to come out right . LAURA . Slap it on what ? PEACH . The gridiron . LAURA . ( Giving money . ) No , we 'd better not try a leg of mutton to-day . Get some lamb chops , we know how to manage them . PEACH . ( As she is going . ) Taters as usual , ' mum ? LAURA .

No need to do more than promise , Miss  --  I keeps my word . I promised Uncle Sam I 'd stick to the flag  --  though they tore my arm off , and by darnation I stuck . I do n't want to tell on you Miss . I want to tell on some one else . LAURA . What do you mean ? SNORKEY . They 're looking for you . LAURA . Who ? SNORKEY . BYKE !

This ? SNORKEY . Yes , it 's his writin '  --  looks like a woman 's , do n't it ? Lord ! the snuff that man 's up to , would make BARNUM sneeze his head off . He 's kept me in hand , ' cause he thinks I know you , having seen you that once . Every day he reads the advertisements , and picks out a dozen or so and says to me : " SNORKEY , that 's like my little pet , " and then he sits down and answers them , and gets the advertisers to make appointments with him , which he keeps regularly , and regularly comes back cussing at his ill luck . See here Miss , I 've a bundle of answers to deliver , as usual , to advertisers . I calls ' em BYKE 'S Target Practice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the mark . LAURA . For Heaven 's sake do not betray me to him ! I 've got very little money . I earn it hardly ; but take it , take it  --  and save me . ( Offers money . ) SNORKEY . No , Miss ; not a cent of it Though BYKE is a devil , and would kick me hard if he thought I would betray him . LAURA . I do n't want you to suffer for my sake , take the money . SNORKEY . No , I stood up to be shot at for thirteen dollars a month , and I can take my chances of a kickin ' for nothing . But BYKE ai n't the only one Miss , there 's another 's looking for you . LAURA . ( Her look of joy changing to fear . ) Another ! Who ? SNORKEY . ( Approaching smiling and confidential . ) Mr. TRAFFORD . ( LAURA turns aside desparingly . ) He 's been at me every day for more than six weeks , " SNORKEY " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you brought the bouquet to on New Year 's night ? " " Well , " says I Capt'n , the young lady I slightly disremember , but the cakes and wine I got there that night I shall never forget .

You have served them well ; serve me and be silent . SNORKEY . Just as you please , Miss , but I hate to serve you by putting your friends off the track  --  it do n't seem natural  --  BYKE I do n't mind ; but the Capt'n he would n't do you any harm . Just let me give him a bit of a hint . ( LAURA makes an entreating gesture . ) Well I 'm mum , but as I 've only got one hand , its hard work to hold my tongue . ( Going . ) Not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turns away . ) They say when a woman says no , she means yes ! I wonder if I dare tell her that he 's not far off . Perhaps I 'd better not . But I can tell him . ( Exit D. F. ) LAURA . How shall I ever escape that dreadful man . And RAY searching for me too ! Our friends then remember us as well as our enemies . ( PEACHBLOSSOM enters quickly D. F. shutting the door behind her , with basket which she places on table C. ) PEACH . O , Miss NINA , whatever is into the people . There 's a strange man coming down the entry . I heard him asking that red cap fellow about you . LAURA . BYKE ! Fasten the door quick , ( PEACH runs to door , it is slightly opened , she pushes it against some one on the other side . ) PEACH . O dear ! He 's powerful strong , I ca n't keep it shut .

PEACH . ( Seriously , L. H. ) No , sir ; I 've swept the sidewalk and gone a marketing , and now I 'm in doors and I mean to stay . RAY . And would n't you oblige me by going for a sheet of paper and an envelope . Here 's a dollar  --  try and see how slow you can be . PEACH . ( Firmly . ) You ca n't sheet of paper me , mister ; I 'm protecting Miss NINA , and I 'm not to be enveloped . LAURA . Go as the gentleman asks you , BLOSSOM . PEACH Oh !

( Shuddering . ) Pardon me , I did not come here to insult your misery . When I saw you I forgot everything else . LAURA . ( R. C. ) And now its time for us to remember everything . I told you to look around that you might understand that in such a place I am no longer LAURA COURTLAND , nor anything I used to be . But I did not ask your pity . There is no misery here . RAY . Alone , without means , exposed to every rudeness , unprotected , is this not misery for you ? LAURA . ( Laughing . ) Oh , it 's not so bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . You can not have exchanged everything that made you happy , for this squalid poverty , and not feel it deeply . LAURA . I have not time to feel anything deeply . ( Takes basket up goes to table , busies herself about preparing dinner . ) I work from sunrise till night , and I sleep so soundly that I have not even dreams to recall the past . Just as you came in I was about to cook our dinner . Only think  --  lamb chops ! RAY . Lamb chops ! It makes me shudder to hear you speak . LAURA . Does it . Then wait till I get the gridiron on the fire , and you 'll shiver . And if you want to be transfixed with horror , stop and take dinner . RAY . I will not hear you mock yourself thus , LAURA . I tell you in this self-banishment you have acted thoughtlessly  --  you have done wrong . LAURA . Why ? RAY . Because , let the miserable creatures who slandered you say what they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A home ! Where the very servants would whisper and point . Friends who would be ashamed to acknowledge me . You are mistaken . That is neither home nor friendship . RAY . And you are resolved to surrender the past forever . LAURA . The past has forgotten me in spite of myself . RAY . Look at me . LAURA . ( Coming down C. ) Well then , there 's one who has not forgotten me , but I desire that he may . You speak to me of bitterness You presence , your words , cause me the first pang I have felt since the night I fled unnoticed from my chamber , and began my life anew . Therefore I entreat you to leave me , to forget me . RAY . LAURA , by the tie that once bound us !  --  LAURA ( Going up . ) Yes , once . It is a long time ago . RAY . What have I said ?  --  the tie which still  --  LAURA . ( Sharply , turning . ) Mr. TRAFFORD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves so pitilessly against me ? When a gesture from you might have saved me ! And you saw me sink without stretching a finger to the woman who had felt the beating of your heart . No , you made your choice then  --  the world without me . I make my choice now  --  the wide , wide , world without you . RAY . I have been bitterly punished , for we are never so humiliated as when we despise ourselves . But , by the Heaven above us both , I love you LAURA , I have never ceased to love you . LAURA . I thank you . I know how to construe the love which you deny in the face of society , to offer me behind its back . RAY . Will you drive me mad ! I tell you LAURA , your misery , your , solitude , is as nothing to the anguish I have suffered The maniac who in his mental darkness stabs to the heart the friend he loved , never felt in returning reason the remorse my error has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You have been false to the heart that loved you , and you shall account for it to your conscience all your life .

( Moved . ) I forgive you . Yes , and I pity you  --  and so good-by , forever . RAY . Of course I am nothing to you now . That is some comfort to me . I have only to be sorry on my own account . But I come to you on behalf of others . LAURA . Whom ? RAY . My mother and PEARL . They ask for you . For them I have sought you , to urge you to return to them . LAURA . Dear little PEARL . RAY . Yes , she has been quite ill . LAURA . She has been ill ? RAY . Think of those two hearts which you have caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is not only wealth , luxury and refinement which you have surrendered  --  you have also cast away those greater riches : loving and devoted friends .

They must never know where I hide my shame , and you must never reveal it . RAY . I promise it , if you will go to them with me . Think , they will insist on coming unless you do . LAURA . Poor PEARL ! If I go with you , you promise not to detain me  --  to permit me to come back , and to trouble me and my poor life no more . RAY . I promise ; but I know you will release me from it when you see them . I will get a carriage . So that no one will meet you . Wait for me , I shall not be long .

No ; be still thou flutt'ring bosom  --  Seasons change and years glide by , They may not harm what is immortal  --  Darling ,  --  love shall never die ! PEARL . Now , I 've sung that to RAY a dozen times , and he never even said it was nice . He has n't any soul for music ; O , dear ! what a creature . MRS . V. D. Mrs. Van Dam Yes , and what a victim you will be with a husband who has $60,000 per annum income . PEARL . That 's some comfort , is n't it ? RAY . ( Enters L. H. bowing to others . ) Going out , PEARL ? PEARL . Yes , we 're off to Shrewsbury . Quite a party 's going  --  four carriages  --  and we mean to stay and ride home by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier ? MRS . V. D. Mrs. Van Dam Earlier ! Pshaw ! What 's in you TRAFFORD . ( The ladies and gent . go up . ) RAY . ( PEARL , C. ) You know that LAURA will be quite alone , and she is still suffering . PEARL . Well , she 'll read and read , as she always did , and never miss me . RAY . But , at least , she ought to have some little attention . PEARL . Dear , dear , what an unreasonable fellow you are . Is n't she happy now  --  did n't you save her from drowning , and hav n't I been as good to her as I can be  --  what more do you want ? RAY . I do n't like to hear you talk so PEARL , and remember what she and you were once . And you know that she was something else once  --  something that you are now to me . And yet how cheerful , how gentle she is . She has lost everything and does not complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know you 're hurt and I 'm a fool . But I ca n't help it .

But you do reprove me . I 'm sure I hav n't been the cause of LAURA 'S troubles . I did n't tell the big , ugly man to come and take her away , although I was once glad he did . RAY . PEARL ! PEARL . Because I thought I had gained you by it . ( RAY turns away . ) But now I 've got you , I do n't seem to make you happy . But I might as well complain that you do n't make me happy  --  but I do n't complain , I am satisfied , and I want you to be satisfied . There , are you satisfied ? MRS . V. D.

It is a sad thing to want for happiness , but it is a terrible thing to see another groping about blindly for it when it is almost within the grasp . And yet she can be very happy with him . Her sunny temper , and her joyous face will brighten any home . ( Sits at table C. , on which are books . ) How happy I feel to be alone with these friends , who are ever ready to talk to me  --  with no longings for what I may not have ,  --  my existence hidden from all , save two in the wide world , and making my joy out of the joy of that innocent child who will soon be his wife . ( PEACHBLOSSOM appears at back looking in cautiously , grotesquely attired . ) PEACH . If you please . LAURA . ( Aloud . ) Who is there . PEACH . ( Running in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm so glad I 've had such a hunt for you . Do n't ask me nothing yet . I 'm so happy . I 've been looking for you so long , and I 've had such hard luck . Lord what a tramp  --  miles on miles . LAURA . Did any one see you come here ? How did you find me ? PEACH . I asked ' em at the Hotel where Mr. TRAFFORD was , and they said at COURTLAND 'S and I asked ' em where COURTLAND 'S was , and they said down the shore , and I walked down lookin ' at every place till I came here . LAURA . Speak low BLOSSOM . My existence is a secret , and no one must hear you . PEACH . Well , Miss , I says to SNORKEY  --  says I  --  LAURA . Is he with you ? PEACH . No Miss , but we are great friends . He wants me to keep house for him some day . I said to him  --  " I want to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went to Mr. TRAFFORD 'S and found he was come to Long Branch , but never a word could we hear of you . LAURA . And the others  --  those dreadful people . PEACH . BYKE and old JUDAS ? Clean gone ! They has n't been seen since they was took up for throwing you in the water , and let off because no one came to Court agin ' em . BERMUDAS says he 's seen ' em in BARNUM 'S wax-work show , but BERMUDAS is such a liar . He brought me up here . LAURA . Brought you up here . PEACH . Yes , he sells papers at STETSON 'S ; he 's got the exclusive trade here , and he has a little wagon and a horse , and goes down to the junction every night to catch the extras from the Express train what do n't come here . He says he 'll give me lots of nice rides if I 'll stay here . LAURA . But you must not stay here . You must go back to New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't . LAURA . BLOSSOM . PEACH . I wo n't , I wo n't , I wo n't ! I 'll never let you away again . I did it once and you was took away and dragged about and chucked overboard and almost drowned . I wo n't be any trouble , indeed I wo n't . I 'll hire out at the hotel , and run over when my work is done at night , when nobody can see me , to look up at your window . Do n't send me away . You 're the only one as ever was good to me . LAURA . ( Aside . ) It 's too dangerous . She certainly would reveal me sooner or later . I must send her back . PEACH . Besides I 've got something to tell you Dreadful ! dreadful ! about old JUDAS and BYKE  --  a secret . LAURA , A secret ? what in the world are you saying ? PEACH . Is it wicked to listen at doors when people talk ? LAURA . It is very wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did it . I used to listen to BYKE and JUDAS when they used to talk about a rich lady whom they called Mrs. COURTLAND . LAURA . Ah ! PEACH . JUDAS used to be a nurse at Mrs. CORTLAND 'S , and was turned off for stealing . And was n't she and BYKE going to make money off her ! and BYKE was to pretend to be some beautiful lady 's father . Then , when they took you , JUDAS says to me : " Did you ever hear of children being changed in their cradles ? "  --  and that you was n't her child , but she was going to make money off the real one at the proper time . " LAURA . What do you tell me ? PEACH . Oh ! I 'm not crazy . I know a heap , do n't I ? And I wa n't you to think I 'm somebody , and not send me away . LAURA . ( To herself . ) She must speak the truth . And yet if I were to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of forging some tale to abuse the ear of Society . No ! better let it rest as it is . She must go  --  and I must go too . PEACH . You ai n't mad with me ? LAURA . No , no ; but you must go away from here . Go back to the hotel to your friend  --  anywhere , and wait for me ; I will come to you . PEACH . Is it a promise ? LAURA . ( Nervously . ) Yes , go . PEACH . Then I 'll go ; for I know you always keep your word  --  you ai n't angry , cause I came after you ? I did it because I loved you  --  because I wanted to see you put in the right place . Honor bright , you ai n't sending me away now ? Well , I 'll go ; good bye ! Exit C. LAURA . ( Animated . ) I must return to the city , no matter what dangers may lurk there . It is dangerous enough to be concealed here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with this girl , detection would be certain . I must go  --  secretly if I can  --  openly if I must . RAY . ( Outside . ) No , I shall not ride again . Put him up . ( Entering . ) LAURA , I knew I should find you here . LAURA . ( Sitting and pretending composure . ) I thought you had gone with PEARL . RAY . I did go part of the way , but I left the party a mile down the road ? LAURA . You and PEARL had no disagreement ? RAY . No  --  yes ; that is , we always have . Our social baromtere always stands at " cloudy " and " overcast . " LAURA . ( Rising . ) And whose fault is that ? RAY . ( Pettishly . ) Not mine . I know I do all I can  --  I say all I can  --  but she  --  ( Crossing . ) LAURA . But she is to be your wife . RAY  --  my friend  --  courtship is the text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its theme . Do not let yours be discontented and unhappy . RAY . To be my wife ; yes . In a moment of foolishness , dazzled by her airs , and teased by her coquettishness , I asked her to be my wife . LAURA . And you repent already ? RAY . ( Taking her hand . ) I lost you , and I was at the mercy of any flirt that chose to give me an inviting look . It was your fault  --  you know it was ! Why did you leave me ? LAURA . ( After conflict with her feelings . ) RAY , the greatest happiness I have ever felt has been the thought that all your affections were forever bestowed upon a virtuous lady , your equal in family , fortune and accomplishments . What a revelation do you make to me , now ! What is it makes you continually war with your happiness ? RAY . I do n't know what it is . I was wrong to accuse you . Forgive me ! I have only my own cowardice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You must not accuse her . RAY . When you were gone , she seemed to have no thought  --  no wish  --  but for my happiness . She constantly invited me to her house , and when I tried to avoid her , met me at every turn . Was she altogether blameless ? LAURA . Yes , it was her happiness she sought , and she had a right to seek it . RAY . Oh ! men are the veriest fools on earth ; a little attention , a little sympathy , and they are caught ,  --  caught by a thing without soul or brains , while some noble woman is forsaken and forgotten . LAURA . ( RAY throws himself into a seat . ) RAY will you hear me ? RAY . ( Looking to her hopefully . ) Yes , speak to me as you used to speak . Be to me as you used to be . LAURA . ( Smiling sadly . ) I can not be that to you , but I can speak as the spirit of the LAURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as you will . LAURA . ( Standing beside him . ) Let the woman you look upon be wise or vain , beautiful or homely , rich or poor , she has but one thing she can really give or refuse  --  her heart ! Her beauty , her wit , her accomplishments , she may sell to you  --  but her love is the treasure without money and without price . RAY . How well , I have learned that . LAURA . She only asks in return , that when you look upon her , your eyes shall speak a mute devotion ; that when you address her , your voice shall be gentle , loving , and kind . That you shall not despise her , because she can not understand , all at once , your vigorous thoughts and ambitious designs ; for when misfortune and evil have defeated your greatest purposes  --  her love remains to console you . You look to the trees for strength and grandeur  --  do not despise the flowers , because their fragrance is all they have to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give ; but it is the only earthly thing which God permits us to carry beyond the grave . RAY . ( Rising . ) You are right . You are always right . I asked PEARL to be my wife , knowing what she was , and I will be just to her . I will do my duty though it break my heart . LAURA . Spoken like a hero . RAY . But it is to you I owe the new light that guides me ; and I will tell her  --  LAURA . Tell her nothing  --  never speak of me . And when you see her , say to her it in she , and she alone , whom you consult and to whom you listen . RAY . And you  --  LAURA . You will see me no more . RAY . You will leave me ? LAURA . Something of me will always be with you  --  my parting words  --  my prayers for your happiness . ( Distant music heard . ) RAY . ( Falling on his knees . ) O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( C. ) No ; to the happiness which follows duty well performed . Such happiness as I feel in doing mine . PICTURE . Scene closes in . During last of this scene the sun has set , and night come on . Stage dark . SCENE II .  --  Woods near Shrewsbury Station  --  Night . ( Enter BYKE shabbily dressed , L. 1 E. ) BYKE . Its getting darker and darker , and I 'm like to lose my way . Where the devil is JUDAS ? It must be nine o'clock , and she was to be at the bend with the wagon half an hour ago . ( Rumble of wheels heard . ) Humph  --  at last . JUDAS . ( Entering L. ) Is that you BYKE ? BYKE . Who did you suppose it was ? I 've been tramping about the wet grass for an hour . JUDAS . It was a hard job to get the horse and wagon . BYKE . Give me a match . ( Lights pipe and leans against a tree . ) Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is on the shore , well away from the other cottages and hotels . BYKE . That 's good . Nothing like peace and quietness . Who 's in the house ? JUDAS . Only the two girls and the servants . BYKE . How many of them ? JUDAS . Four . BYKE . It 'll be mere child 's play to go through that house . Have you spied about the swag ? JUDAS . They have all their diamonds and jewels there ; PEARL wears them constantly ; they 're the talk of the whole place . BYKE . We 'll live in luxury off that girl all our lives . She 'll settle a handsome thing on us , wo n't she ? when she knows what we know , and pays us to keep dark ;  --  if t' other one do n't spoil the game . JUDAS . Curse her ! I could cut her throat . BYKE . O , I 'll take care of that ! JUDAS . You always do things for the best , dear old BYKE ! BYKE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? JUDAS . Not ten yet . BYKE . An hour to wait . JUDAS . But , BYKE , you wo n't peach on me before my little pet is married , will you ? BYKE . What 's the fool about now ? JUDAS . I ca n't help trembling ; nothing is safe while LAURA is there . BYKE . I 've provided for that . I 've had the same idea as you ;  --  while she 's in the way , and TRAFFORD unmarried , our plans are all smoke , and we might as well be sitting on the hob with a keg of powder in the coals . JUDAS . That we might . But what have you thought to do ? BYKE . Why , I 've thought what an unfortunate creature LAURA is ,  --  robbed of her mother , her home , and her lover ; nothing to live for ; it would be a mercy to put her out of the way . JUDAS . That 's it ; but how  --  how  --  how  --  BYKE . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the materials are very handy down here . What made you talk about cutting her throat ? It was very wrong ; when a thing gets into my head , it sticks there . JUDAS . You ought n't to mind me . BYKE . Make your mind easy on that score . JUDAS . ( Alarmed . ) BYKE , I heard some one in the bushes just there . ( Points off R. ) BYKE . ( Nervously and quickly . ) Who ? Where ? ( Going R. ) JUDAS . Where the hedge is broken . I could swear I saw the shadow of a man . BYKE . Stop here . I 'll see . Off R. JUDAS . ( Solus . ) I begin to shiver . But it must be done or we starve . Why should I tremble ? it 's the safest job we ever planned . If they discover us , our secret will save us ;  --  we know too much to be sent to jail . ( Re-enter BYKE , slowly . ) BYKE . There are traces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. ) JUDAS . Suppose we should have been overheard ! BYKE . ( Glaring at her . ) Overheard ? Bah ! no one could understand . JUDAS . Come , let us go to the wagon and be off . BYKE . ( Always looking off R. ) Go you , I will follow . Bring it round by the station , and wait for me in the shadows of the trees . I will follow . ( JUDAS goes off L. BYKE , after a moment ,  --  still looking R. ,  --  buttons up his coat , and hides behind wood , R. H. ) Heigho ! I must be off . ( Enter SNORKEY , slowly , R. ) SNORKEY . Tracked ' em again ! We 're the latest fashionable arrivals at Long-Branch . " Mr. BYKE and LADY , and Brigadier-General SNORKEY , of New-York " ;  --  there 's an item for the papers ! With a horse and wagon , they 'll be at the seaside in two hours ; but in the train I think I 'll beat ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wink , and be ready to receive the distinguished visitors with all the honors . Robbery ; Burglary ; Murder ;  --  that 's BYKE 'S catechism :  --  " What 's to be done when you 're hard up ? Steal ! What 's to be done if you 're caught at it ? Kill ! " It 's short and easy , and he lives up to it like a good many Christians do n't live up to their laws . ( Looking off L. ) They 're out of sight . Phew ! it 's midsummer , but I 'm chilled to the bone ; something like a piece of ice has been stuck between my shoulders all day , and something like a black mist is always before me . ( BYKE is behind tree . ) Just like old NETTLY told me he felt , the night before Fredericksburg ;  --  and next day he was past all feeling ,  --  hit with a shell , and knocked into so many pieces , I did n't know which to call my old friend . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go ; and if I can save them , I 'll have some little capital to start the next world on . The next world ! perhaps I sha n't be the maimed beggar there that I am in this .

Are you the man in charge of this station ? SIGNAL . Yes , ma'am . LAURA . When is there another train for New York ? SIGNAL . New York ? Not till morning . We 've only one more train to-night ; that 's the down one ; it 'll be here in about twenty minutes  --  " Express Train . " LAURA . What place is that ? SIGNAL . That ? That 's the signal station shed . It serves for storeroom , depot , baggage-room , and everything . LAURA . Can I stay there to-night ? SIGNAL . There ? well it 's an odd place , and I should think you would hardly like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have my reasons  --  urgent ones . It is not because I want money . You shall have this ( producing portmonnaie ) if you let me remain here . SIGNAL . Well , I 've locked up a good many things in there over night , but I never had a young lady for freight before . Besides ma'am , I do n't know anything about you . You know it 's odd that you wo n't go to a decent hotel , and plenty of money in your pocket . LAURA . You refuse me  --  well  --  I shall only have to sit here all night . SIGNAL . Here in the open air ? Why it would kill you . LAURA . So much the better . SIGNAL . Excuse me for questions , Miss , but you 're a running away from some one , ai n't you ? LAURA . Yes . SIGNAL . Well , I 'd like to help you . I 'm a plain man you know , and I 'd like to help you , but there 's one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( LAURA interested . ) I 'm on to fifty years of age , and I 've many children , some on ' em daughters grown . There 's a  --  many temptations for young gals , and sometimes the old man has to put on the brakes a bit , for some young men are wicked enough to persuade the gals to steal out of their father 's house in the dead of night , and go to shame and misery . So tell me this  --  it ai nt the old man , and the old man 's home you 've left , young lady ? LAURA . No ; you good , honest , fellow  --  no  --  I have no father . SIGLAL . Then by Jerusalem ! I 'll do for you what I can . Anything but run away from them , that have not their interest but yours at heart . Come , you may stay there , but I 'll have to lock you in . LAURA . I desire that you should . SIGNAL . It 's for your safety as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that door that would give a skeleton key the rheumatism to fool with it . You do n't mind the baggage . I 'll have to put it in with you , hoes , shovels , mowing machines and what 's this  --  axes . Yes a bundle of axes . If the Superintendent finds me out , I 'll ask him if he was afraid you 'd run off with these . ( Laughs . ) So if you please I 'll first tumble ' em in . ( Puts goods in house , LAURA sitting on platform R H. looking at him . When all in , he comes towards her , taking up cheese-box to put it in Station . ) I say Miss , I ai n't curious  --  But of course it 's a young man you 're a going to ? LAURA . So far from that , it 's a young man I 'm running away from . SIGNAL . ( Dropping box . ) Running away from a young man ! Let me shake hands with you . ( Shakes her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At your age too ! ( Seriously . ) I wish you 'd come and live down in my neighborhood a while , among my gals .

My heart feels lighter already  --  it 's a good omen . SIGNAL . Now Miss , bless your heart , here 's your hotel ready . ( Goes to switch and takes coat off , putting it on . ) LAURA . Thanks my good friend ; but not a word to any one  --  till to-morrow ; not even  --  not even to your girls . SIGNAL . Not a word , I promise you . If I told my girls it would be over the whole village before morning . ( She goes in . He locks door . LAURA appears at window facing audiences . ) LAURA . Lock me in safely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

It 's all safe this way my noisy beauty , and you may come as soon as you like . Good night , Miss ! LAURA . ( At window . ) Good night . SIGNAL . Running away from a young man , Ha ! ha ! ha !

( To SIGNAL MAN who re-enters . ) Hollo I say , the train wo n't stop here too long will it . SIGNAL . Too long ? It wo n't stop here at all . SNORKEY . I must reach the shore to night . There 'll be murder done , unless I can prevent it ! SIGNAL . Murder , or no murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lie . By waving the red signal for danger , the engineer must stop , I tell you ! SIGNAL . Do you think I 'm a fool . What ? disobey orders and lose my place ; then what 's to become of my family . ( Exit R. U. E. ) SNORKEY . I wo n't be foiled . I will confiscate some farmer 's horse about here , and get there before them somehow .

BYKE coils the rope round his legs . ) Hollo ! what 's this ? BYKE . You 'll see . ( Picks the helpless SNORKEY up . ) SNORKEY . BYKE what are you going to do ! BYKE . Put you to bed .

That I do ; but I almost thought I was dead , and it was an angel 's . Where are you ? LAURA . In the station . SNORKEY . I ca n't see you , but I can hear you . Listen to me , Miss , for I 've got only a few minutes to live . LAURA . ( Shaking door . ) God help me ! and I can not aid you . SNORKEY . Never mind me , Miss . I might as well die now , and here , as at any other time . I 'm not afraid . I 've seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scare me ; but , for the sake of those you love , I would live . Do you hear me ? LAURA .

How nice and fresh the air is !  --  ( she turns down lamp . ) It 's much nicer here than going to bed .  --  ( settles herself in tete-a-tete for a nap . Pause . ) Moonbeams fall on BYKE , who appears above the balcony . He gets over the rail and enters . BYKE . Safely down ! I 've made no mistake  --  no , this is her room . What a figure I am for a ladies chamber . ( Goes to table picks up delicate lace handkerchief , and wipes his face . ) Phew ! Hot ! ( Puts handkerchief in his pocket . ) Now for my bearings .

It 's a wonder she do n't feel me in the air and dream of me . If she does she 'll wake sure  --  but it 's easy to settle that . ( Takes phial of chloroform from his pocket  --  saturates the handkerchief he picked up , and applies it . ) So !  --  now my charmer  --  we 'll have the ear-rings . ( Takes them out . ) What 's here . ( Going to table . ) Bracelets  --  diamonds ! ( Going to dresses , and feeling in the pockets . ) Money ! That 's handy . ( He puts all in a bag , and hands them over balcony . ) Now for the drawers , there 's where the treasure must be . Locked ? ( Tries them with bunch of keys . ) Patent lock , of course ! It amuses me to see people buying patent locks , when there 's one key will fit ' em all . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to force the drawer , a shout is heard , and noise of wagon . ) What 's that .

My good fellow , do n't interupt gentlemen who are conversing together . ( To RAY . ) I address you , sir  --  you design to commit me to the care of the officers of the law ? RAY . Most certainly . BYKE . And you will do your best towards having me incarcerated in the correctional establishments of this country ? ( RAY bows . ) SNORKEY . How very genteel ! BYKE . Then I have to say if you will , I shall make a public exposure of certain matters connected a certain young lady . LAURA . Do not think that will deter us from your punishment . I can bear even more than I have  --  for the sake of justice . BYKE . Excuse me , but I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then ? BYKE . ( Pointing to PEARL ) To her . RAY . Miss COURTLAND ? BYKE .
