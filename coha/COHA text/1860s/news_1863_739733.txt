txt RUMORS AND NESROES . The telegraph has not taken the trouble either to contradict or confirm the story it brought us , a few days since , that the rebels had captured a regiment of negro soldiers at Helena , Arkansas , and had hung every man of them , with all their white officers . We should think that when it was thought worth while to startle the whole country with a rumor of this kind , it would also be considered worth while to contradict it when it was proven to be false . The absurd stories which are often telegraphed to the Press may , perhaps , not be thought worthy of contradiction , but the fact is they deceive many people , and leave many others in doubt . News should either be more carefully sifted by the agents , or else they should take more pains to furnish the public any subsequent information that may be obtained on any given subject . In the meantime , it may be taken for granted that:there was not a word of truth in the telegram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as that place is within a ? few hours ' sail of Memphis , from which *there is telegraphic communication all over the country ; and the news has had no confirmation . The original story came from Murfreesboro , and there it was obtained from rebel sources . So it probably only indicated what the rebels would like to do , instead of what they actually did . The rebel threat , however , that they would hang our negro soldiers , if caught , have had their effect ; , and , in any event , the Government has decided upon its course . We have now at the West four or five thousand rebel prisoners ; and the President , it is said , means to have them all retained until this question of hanging negro soldiers is settled .
