txt The King of Dahomey ornaments his palace with the skulls of his enemies . The ruler of the new Dahomey . which is striving to e yPui itself into a nationality at the eolith , has not . yet . progressed so fur into barbarism as this . but the custom appears not to huve been Ute known or unpracticed among those of his subjects who whiled away their time for some months back about Manassas and Centreville . The tale was too horrid for belief at first , and though we never exactly agreed with some of the English papers in their opinion that the rebels had carried on the war like a high-minded and civilized people , yet we could hardly believe that any human being , who was not an acknowledged savage , would be guilty of taking the skulls of fallen foes for ornaments , making eastinets outs . of their ribs and spurs out of their jawlbones  --  and there are those in our community to whom the whole story is still only an enormous canard . " It , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be . The rebels were our brothers , living in peace and amity with us little more than a year ago , and is it to be supposed that they should so soon have lost all feelings o/ kindliness , so soon have degenerated from our boasted American civilization so far as to be guilty of such deeds as these ? " And we see that even Dr. BELLOWS disposed of the matter by saying that there were doubtless barbarian in both armiee , and that the Virginians : with whom he had conversed expressed the great ? est horror at such atrocities . We doubt . ne that this is so . We know that there arc among our lower classes at the North Hier whom vice and crime have brutalized , am who , in the license of war , would show them . selves barbarians . And yet , from all the evi dence that has come to our knOwledge , protest against any such equalization of the two armies . We believe that when the stor , of the time comes to be written , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elements of civilization , in patient en ? durance and firm courage on the battle-field ; and in kindness and gentleness and true nobility toward those whom the fortune of will placed in their power , the Union t mops were immeasurably the superiors of the rebels . For cruelty , for malignity , for use of both hand and tongue for evil , for deeds of atrocity and barbarity , the rebels , on the whole , will easily hear ofi the palm . Not only does the evidence of Stich acts On their part already abound in over measure , but all the analogies show that this would be so . Ignorance is the fruitful mother of all such deeds . Need we go to the figures of the census to show which army would be most ignorant ? If one white man in live in South Carolina could not rend and write , while only one in over two hundred is so ignorant in MassaChusetts , what wonder that in Massachusetts re. - n- lents every one . of the soldiers should sign his name to the pay-roll. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the other States : and we doubt not that it would be found that the standard of education was lowest of the low in that Georgia regiment who were guilty of the atrocity committed upon the remains of Major BALLer , of the Second Rhode Island . And we can never forget that the rebels have lived under a social system which hugged to its bosom the " twin relic of barbarism , " with all its nameless cruelties and atrocities , and many of them must have become familiar with barbarities of which we have only read in books . Such a system of itself could never fail to barbarize the people . And when upon such a people is brought the forcing heat of a civil war , how could any other result be expected than the sudden starting into new and ranker and more monstrous growth of all those dark plants of evil for which Slavery is so fertile a soil If the cowardly and brutal act of I'iu S. BROOM was glorified throughout the South , if the RR V. 's tanned the skin of Jonx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Medical College at Winchester , with the inscription , " Jonx Bnows 's son  --  thus always with Abolitionists ; " thus desecrating the halls of science by gratifying spite at the expense of all decency ? if such things are done in time of peace , what could we expect in time of civil war ? If such thing are done in the green tree , what shall be done in the dry ? And to all these tendencies we have to add the powerful assistance of a brutalized Press . One can hardly read an article from a Southern paper which does not directly appeal to the fiercer passions , and strive to stimulate their fire . Not to speak of the infamous falsehoods which have filled their columns , attfibuting to us motives and purposes , Which of themselves would stir up . an ignorant people to frenzy against us , they have continuously and directly excited to the greatest bloodthirstiness , and , with tongues " set on fire of hell , " they have cultivated malignity , and rolled cruelty as a sweet morsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible fruits , and of which the end is not yet seen  --  hardly the beginning . And , alas , there has seemed to be hut little onposit , iN : evil tendoneit.s in one ** WhicliiveshoUld natutialftope much . The influence of the women has not been so humanizing- as we should have expected . Slavery and secession , which have made dev- ' Hs of so many men , seem to have made furies of the women . The letters . to soldiers , : gathered up by our victorious troops from Virginia to Missouri , tell a sad story in this respect . While there are many which breathe of home and affection , and the softening influences for which we have learned to look to woman , yet there is another and a large class , which breathe forth only " threatenings and slaughter .

And what can be expected , when women urge men to evil inAtead of away from it We do not anticipate a ebanga for the better in'this direction at present . On the contrary , with the more contracted limits and the waning fortunes of the rebellion , we look to see yet more terrible developments of these evil thingtA , for the force of desperf lion will be added to the tendencies whi ( 11 ' have already wrought such dreadful result : ?
