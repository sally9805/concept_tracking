ARTICLE lit-A BIOGRAPHER AT WORK . AN author who was about giving to the world the memoirs of a friend , not possessed of any singular claim upon public interest , gravely announced in the preface to his work that his friend was par excellence a biographer , and that , in his opinion , to have written a readable memoir constituted a sufficient reason why the author 's own life should in turn be written . Prior wrote the life of Goldsmith and that of Burke ; therefore , argues our author , it is proper that I should write the life of Prior , and , therefore , he was too modest to add , but surely too logical to deny , some day my life must be written . If this opinion is to be accepted , one shudders at the endless entail of biographies ! Nevertheless , in full view of all the consequences , we propose to step into line , looking before and after like a wise man . We know a person who has written a biography , and we propose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account for so much of it only as was occupied in the biogra phic task , we rigidly demand of the biographer , whom by this act we entail upon ourself , that he shall preserve the same ratio , and write only that chapter of our memoirs which would cover the time spent in preparation of this essay . In this way we are most ingeniously reducing one line of biographic debt , and though it is metaphysically impossible that the score should ever be wholly wiped out , yet practically we are entailing only a pitiful and absurdly minute ecumbrance upon the last coiner , whenever he shall appear . For observe , our friend wrote a life ; we write so much of his life as wrote that ; our biographer-for we can not help ourself , modest as we arewill write a still smaller segment of our life ; his biographer just sits down for ten minutes , say , writes a few lines , and is free by the contract ; his biographer , again-we mean the biographer of this last biographer-does his part , 8tans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute which every one can easily find in the course of his life , and with the happy consciousness of // having done his duty easily , he cheerfully submits to have his life taken for that minute , and leaves a memorandum to the effect . It is positively exhilarating to see this mountain of debt dwindling so fast to a grain of sand , and in the full glow of the encouraging prospect we begin our task , promising our readers and our future biographer to be as brief as possible , and promising our subject , for we must not forget that side of the obligation , that we shall be governed in the proportions of our Article , by a due regard for the time and labor which he expended on his hero . It is not necessary to recount the circumstances which imposed the task upon him . Suffice it to say , that he found himself in some sort compelled to undertake a. work from which he shrank , and for which he felt no special aptitude . He had used his pen somewhat in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not wholly without confidence in attempting this ; but the nature of the work made him draw back . He was called upon to write the life of one whom he had known intimately , had loved , and honored . His friend was not a person of public repute , whose life he would only need to sketch lightly , and the public would recognize the portrait , filling it in with their own impressions ; he was intimately known only to a few , and not having left any published writings , indicative of his character , would inevitably soon be forgotten except by those few . The task , then , which the biographer assumed was to satisfy first his friends ' associates , by a truthful record of the life which they had known with different degrees of intimacy , and next to present to outside people who might be approached , an interesting and complete account of one whom they never had known . The question here arose-how far was the tone of the biography to be taken from that prevailing in the class with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of religious character and Christian enterprise . The biographer saw that it was amongst religious people that he must look chiefly for his readers , and among religious memoirs that his book would lie . But he felt a repugnance toward this class of literature ; he had come to regard it as pervaded by an unhealthy tone ; it seemed to him almost an inevitable charac // teristic of religious memoirs that they should treat religion as an unlovely and unnatural element in life , almost in fact as a disease . There was a certain method in their dissection of the spirit , as if they wished to disprove Christ 's words , and show that it was possible to tell , of one born of the Spirit , whence that Spirit came and whither it went . Those which recorded mainly religious aspirations and regrets seemed to him as senseless as ordinary biographies would be which should give as indications of life a daily memorandum of the condition of a man 's lungs as tested by the stethoscope ; and besides , how different these emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same expressions read years afterwards it may be by one unable to reproduce the ligaments which bound them to a living soul . " Is there not something unnatural , " he once said to us , " in religious biography at all , as a distinctive class ? Or ought not the distinction to be made a broad one , throwing all lives into two great classes , according as they do or do not spring from religious principle ? Biography of scientific men , of literary men , of statesmen , of artisans there may be , lives even of eminent shoemakers , and , perhaps , according to a very recent school , lives of men who have once been boys ; but religion is not an acquisition like scientific or political knowledge , nor is eminence in it analagous to eminence in some art or trade ; it is vital , not accidental . " While we confessed to a common prej udice with our friend , we pointed out to him that there must be such a distinct class , since those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of ordinary Christian society are by this very exaltation eminent people , marked , attracting attention , and therefore such as the world wishes to know further about when they are dead , apart from any eminence which they may have attained in human pursuits ; but that , in writing the lives of such men , biographers made the mistake of treating religion as an end to be attained , instead of a vital power at work in the soul . Indeed , we added , the very failure which you affirm of this class of writings demonstrates the high place in art which the class occupies . The easiest life to write is that which is most outward ; a life of adventure is the lowest form of biography . The hardest life to write is that which demands a record because // of its strong character ; and the highest form of biography is that which undertakes to display character through a representation of those forms which in actual life best contain and exhibit it . And what order of character presents to the biographer more glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionizing it ? The meshes of a man 's inner life are not easy to trace , and when the great Weaver is busy in weaving the excellent pattern of Christ , the task of tracing becomes more difficult . Here let us digress for a moment to observe how excellent an opportunity exists for creating a class of religious works healthy , instructive , and yet very interesting-three desired elements which Sunday school librarians fii*d it so hard to supply . If the writers of lives of religious men were to study for their task by writing novels , they would discover some valuable principles of the biographic art . The highest order of novels may be said to be that which creates men and women , and suffers their characters to work out their own destiny . There are surely but few general readers who can not be won to the study of individual growth as gradually unfolded by the novelist 's art . Why should not biography borrow the same aid , and taking the life of some person , quite unknown to fame , but having a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character under its changing experience of life , sketching with such fullness as need be the world of nature and society in which it moved , and showing how it was renewed and sanctified by Divine grace ? Our biographies are too bald . We are told , perhaps , that the subject was born in New York ; and as many persons have been in New York , nothing more is said about the city . But why should not a little sketch be given of the city and city life , as seen behind the human figure ? He goes to Yale , and that intense little world of which he becomes a force , attracting and attracted , is reduced to the merest shadow ; and so throughout the book  --  the hero is the only figure , and for want of more substance in the accompanying shadow , himself loses so much of his individuality as is the result of palpable connexion with men and things . We did not at the time suggest this to our friend , but in planning his work he adopted some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a study of character that the life // which he was to write would possess any literary value or any influence . Among our friend 's papers which have fallen to our use in preparing this sketch , we find this paragraph , copied from Carlyle 's essay on Burns , and marked " This must be remembered if I ever have to write a biography " : - " If an individual is really of consequence enough to have his life and character recorded for public remembrance , we have always been of opinion that the public ought to be made acquainted with all the inward springs and relations of his character . How did the world and man 's life from his particular position represent themselves to his mind ? How did coexisting circumstances modify him from without ? How did he modify these from within ? With what endeavors and what efficacy rule over them ? With what resistance and what suffering sink under them ? In one word , what and how produced was the effect of society on him ? and what and how produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note appended , evidently much later , judging from the color of the ink and the style of handwriting : - " Can pue use the scalpel on his familiar friend ? " He shrank instinctively from pursuing such a course with one whose death was still fresh in his memory . It requires no sacrifice of feeling to analyze most minutely the character of one 's imaginary hero . There the intellect feels no restraint ; but to grope about in the heart of a dead friend , no matter how pure one may feel it to be , creates a revulsion of feeling . Yet the analysis must be made , and happily for him , with his interest in psychology , there existed a continual restraint upon a mere prying intellectualism in the reverence which he felt for the dead , and the sense of his own inferiority in its presence . The analysis must be made ; yet it is not the highest art , and so our friend felt , merely to reproduce it in the same form . He must analyze , but the reader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same material from which to form his own analysis ; hence the aim of the biographer was to cast the life in his book in a structural form . He was obliged to tear down , in order that he might rebuild after the same pattern in miniature . Thus he analyzed the world about his subject , and selected representative forms which should as forms of art suit the requirements of his work , and as forms of nature suggest // to the reader 's mind a multitude which could not be introduced , and which would be worse than useless if they were crowded into the story . It was plain that the nicest care must be taken to preserve the proper proportion in this structure . The only rule which seemed applicable in determining it was to observe strictly not the accidental measure of time , but the real measure of growth . Stated in more general terms , the law would be , that having determined the central fact in the hero 's life or character which renders him a proper subject for a memoir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his proportions are marshaled . Thus , in the present case , our friend determined that growth of character under the impelling force of a master purpose in life was such a fact , and accordingly gave most minutely that period of life which witnessed the awakening of the purpose , and its immediate antecedents and consequents . He saw that childhood , here as almost always , while it contained the character , contained it in a very limited sphere of expression , and that his chief care was to present the surrounding personages and circumstances which were to affect the early development , letting the child be projected from this back-ground only by such slight exhibitions of nature as one can make use of in describing a child 's disposition ; for while we get a very positive impression of a child 's character from the numberless unguarded exhibitions of it , we are obliged to convey our impressions to others only through the most general terms ; hence he aimed to let the child come forward a little into society , and display itself , not by words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language of children than of men . But upon leading his subject into a more self-dependent and isolated condition , he began to aim at more rounded expression , and to give circumstances more and more the task of defining and throwing into bolder relief the character projected from them , until at length the subject of the biography became almost a solitary figure , and externals were created only as he brought them into notice . In fact , beginning with chiseling a figure in basso relievo , our friend proceeded to execute it in alto relievo , and finally constructed a detached statue . In each period into which his hero 's life might // properly be divided , he tried to picture him as he would seem to careful observers , seeing him then only , and avoided the anticipation of results even though they might give completeness to some partial sketch . Nor was he unmindful of what may be called the proportions of breadth . It was quite as important that the various sides presented by character should be correctly adjusted , as that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the watchful observance of the equilibrium of the nature which he was displaying . The proverb of an " inch to a man 's nose , " hinting at the fearful distortion which may result from the painter 's incorrect eye , holds also in the case of biography , where mental features are more in danger of obliquity . The character , let us suppose , has its whimsical side ; but if that be unduly dwelt upon , for the sake of making the general effect light and agreeable , the result may be to produce unjust contempt-so a cheerful month may , from the painter 's over anxiety to preserve the cheerful lines , be made to express a repulsive smirk . But while this statement explains somewhat our friend 's theory of treatment , it must be observed that all this care could easily be fatal to success , unless he secured the presence of a still higher element more intangible than these . His analysis could endanger the life of the subject , making the real man seem only a corpse under the knife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break up the life into disjointed fragments , and his adjustment of the elements of character might prove nothing but a timid and tedious balancing of thesis and antithesis . It was necessary that throughout his work the shadow of the man himself should somehow rest upon it . He had to work minutely to preserve exact proportions , and all the while to convey that general idea of lifelikeness which can not be superimposed , nor interposed , but must in fact be eupposed . It was manifest that this was the most elusive element to be reached after ; the rest could in some sort be attained by study , and carefully won , but this lay outside of any special effort , and was rather the reward of patient labor in other directions . " 0 that those lips had language ! " // was surely spoken beneath a portrait which by its faithfulness seemed almost the reality , and just so far as a memoir makes us forget the printed page and its author , and feel the " Touch of a vanished hand , Th* sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a successful memoir or memory-life . In catching and conveying this air of likeness , however he succeeded , he felt himself aided very much by his personal and familiar acquaintance with tl4e one whom he was characterizing . " I do not see , " he said to us , " how I could possibly write with any sort of satisfaction in its truthfulness the life of a person whom I did not know intimately , much less one whom I never saw at all , who lived perhaps in another age and in foreign society . Now I have been able at each stage of my work to call up vividly before me , to see him just as he then looked , and though I can not produce the peculiar expression of his face at particular occasions , for words are not lines , yet I am greatly helped by it in imparting a confident air of truthfulness to the scene . Indeed , I felt the aid very strongly when I had occasion to write of him in situations where I had no personal acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather it may be said instead of it , for we do not attach the same importance to personal acquaintance which our friend maintained , that he possessed the more valuable aid of an affectionate enthusiasm for his subject . This it was which was likely to make his representation lifelike , for it supplied the warm blood that should flow through the veins of the character recorded , and if it failed to manifest itself ; it was because of a too sober cast of mind in the biographer , and not because of any apprehension which he felt lest his enthusiasm and affection should render him partial in judgment . It is often urged that a near relation is disqualified from writing the life of a person , but surely not unless the relation be non compoc mentie ; for what intellectual skill can construct the friendship and sympathy essential for correct comprehension of a man 's character , comparable with that born in one of the same blood and kinship ? The world does not want exact lines in the portraits of its hero 's face , nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make it believe in the existence there of a common nature . To the biographer himself engaged earnestly in his work there fell rewards which he had not anticipated , but which came to be in his mind the most satisfying of any which could be granted . As he got more deeply into his work he found it more absorbing in interest , and the daily allotment of time which he began with gradually extended its limits . Nor did his subject leave him at the end of his working hours , but intruded itself into his thoughts at all times . Atffrst he tried to escape from it , oppressed by this constant visitor ; he fled for relief to other pursuits and distracting entertainments . But since he daily returned to his subject at the appointed hour he strengthened its hold upon his interest , until he became reconciled to the constant presence and found in it a quiet joy . It is much to live with a good man day after day , to think of his character , even though , indeed because , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of power , and to be so at one with him , that for a time you also seem to have something of the same earnestness of purpose , are thrilled with the enthusiasm which he possessed , and go with him through the scenes which tried his soul , as if you were undergoing the same experience . The oblique light too , which our friend 's study cast upon other matters which interested him , was often more valuable than the djrect rays which he tried to throw upon them . Indeed , there seemed to him no other study , except the study of the life of Christ , which was so productive as the study of the life of one man . You live , he would say , for months in the company of a single person ; you are let into secrets of his life which only he and you may know ; you analyze his life and reconstruct it in your memorial , and by all this study you get a deeper insight into the human heart than would be possible by any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , far deeper certainly than is possible to get through mere familiarity with many living faces . But when all is done , when you have tried to fathom this one man 's heart , you know that you have only troubled the face of the waters with your lead , that deeper than any plummet of the human intellect can sound , lie depths of the soul , and you arise from your task // with new conceptions of the worth of humanity and profounder views of that redemption which was so costly because the ruin was so great . When his work was completed , and he had read over for the last of a long series of times the paragraphs which he had constructed , he pushed it all away with a sigh and turning to us said , half in jest : " There it is all done , and J wish never to look at it again . I feel about it as I do about a picture of my best friend . That I refuse to ask for , because I would rather work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recollections , than turn indolently to a picture to refresh my memory ; to do this would in time cause all my recollection to be bounded by the single meagre expression . In the same way I would rather have the glory of one of Turner 's pictures growing dim in my memory , if it must , than pack it all within a steel engraving , is now mine more thoroughly than he ever was in life , but if I read this book over whenever I want to think of him , he will gradually dwindle down into the limits constructed by my memoir . " Such were some of the points in our friend 's experience as he assayed to be a biographer . He often told us of the reflections which he made from time to time , but he left no memoranda of them and we can not recall t1*iem . Our own task has been that of the historian , not of the critic , and therefore we have properly abstained from any estimate of his work . He himself had criticised it so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any anxiety as to what others might say of it ; his chief apprehension was lest the friends of the person whose life he had written might be disappointed in the failure of the sketch to answer their own recollection . Beyond that he could not bring himself to borrow trouble . We venture to express the hope that our own biographer , who is now to consider himself duly appointed our successor in the biographic line , will perform his task in the same temper , regardless of ordinary criticism and only anxious to be truthful in recording the experience which we have passed through in preparing this biographical sketch .
