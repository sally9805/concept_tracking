WASHINGTON  --  In a gesture that could help promote a compromise on the federal deficit , Treasury Secretary James Baker acknowledged that the Reagan administration ' s new budget calls for some selected tax increases . Appearing before the Senate Budget Committee , Mr. Baker said that in the president ' s fiscal 1988 budget , " there are $6. 1 billion of receipts , revenues  --  call it what you will  --  that , I think it ' s fair to say , probably represent ( higher ) taxes . " Mr. Baker reiterated President Reagan ' s firm objection to a general tax increase . But his remarks were the first public acknowledgment by an administration official that the politically charged term " tax " ought to apply to a list of proposed revenue-raising measures contained in the budget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1 , 1987 . The measures include a $1 fee on airline tickets for flights into and out of the U.S. and repeal of the tax exemption for gasohol . On Wednesday , Budget Director James Miller disputed assertions by committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller insisted that there are differences between the Reagan proposals and tax increases . Mr. Baker , too , sought to draw distinctions between the kinds of proposals the administration would accept and those it wouldn ' t . But his comments suggested that the Treasury won ' t adopt an inflexible view in scrutinizing congressional revenue-raising ideas . Most of Mr. Baker ' s comments on taxes came in response to questions by Sen. Warren Rudman . The New Hampshire Republican said that Congress is likely to reject most of the $18 billion in domestic spending cuts proposed by the president , and that more federal revenue would thus be needed in a deficit-reduction compromise . Sen. Rudman asked the Treasury chief to explain how excise taxes on items such as cigarettes differ from administration proposals such as the airline-ticket tax , which the budget describes as a " fee " to finance the U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration . " Excise taxes are excise taxes . And they ' re taxes , " Mr. Baker replied , indicating that the administration generally opposes them . He then acknowledged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increases . These include provisions that would , in the administration ' s view , correct some inequities in the tax law . One proposal , for example , would require restaurateurs and other employers to pay payroll taxes on the total tip income earned by employees ; currently , employers are liable for tax only on the portion of tips equal to the federal minimum wage . Mr. Baker noted that some similar items were proposed in the administration ' s previous budget , which was submitted to Congress 11 months ago . He said that user fees for government services and sales of federal assets  --  which the Reagan budget also proposes  --  shouldn ' t be considered taxes . The administration has no problem with user fees or asset sales , the Treasury chief said . Pressing his case , Sen. Rudman said : " What I understand the president to be saying is , ' We will not have broad-ranging taxes . ' But . . . are we going to get the administration ' s cooperation in what we euphemistically call use and excise taxes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept substituting an $18 billion excise-tax package for its spending cut proposals . And citing the president ' s beliefs about higher taxes , the Treasury secretary took a negative view of committee members ' requests for a " budget summit " between the White House and congressional leaders . " That ' s always been a code word for , ' Let ' s put a tax increase on the table , ' " Mr. Baker said . But Sen. Paul Simon ( D. , Ill. ) said : " The reality is , we have revenue on the table right now , whether we call it taxes or something else . " Other committee members echoed that view and suggested that Congress is likely to expand on the administration ' s package of selected tax increases . Chairman Lawton Chiles ( D. , Fla. ) , citing a report that $150 billion to $175 billion in mergers took place last year , suggested that the government assess a " user fee " on mergers . When Mr. Baker objected that user fees apply to government services rather than private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about a user fee to fund the Antitrust Division " of the Justice Department . In other testimony , Secretary Baker confirmed that the White House will be proposing trade legislation this year . Previously , the administration had rejected cooperating with congressional advocates of new trade laws for fear of promoting protectionism . But its strategy has shifted in favor of proposing more moderate legislation . " We do need to strengthen laws that will help us open markets abroad , " Mr. Baker said . At the House Budget Committee , members criticized the administration ' s plans to slash farm spending , but the protests were mostly restrained . During testimony by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng , members variously took the Reagan budget to task for planning sizable income-support cuts starting in 1988 , which lawmakers said could hurt struggling family farmers , and for urging a tighter $50 , 000-per-farm cap on such payments , which some members said would inhibit export-boosting rice and cotton-subsidy programs . Chairman William Gray ( D. , Pa. ) said he doubted the " realism " of the budget ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income-protection payments in fiscal 1988 , when the administration predicts a 13% drop in farm subsidies , to $21. 27 billion . Rep. Gray noted that the Congressional Budget Office assumes $3 billion of such payments , similar to ones mandated for fiscal 1986 and 1987 . Saying that sharply reduced government price supports under a major 1985 farm law haven ' t spurred a major U.S. export rebound , as they were supposed to do , Rep. Richard Durbin ( D. , Ill. ) told Mr. Lyng , " This administration ' s continued call for patience has not been well received . " But the secretary continued that call , saying that while " ( export ) prospects . . . are rather dismal " as of now , his department is " cautiously optimistic " they ' ll improve .
