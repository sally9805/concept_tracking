Turning left , the voters follow a charmer called Andreas <P> With parades , wreath-laying ceremonies and special Masses , Greeks this week will mark Ohi Day , one of their proudest national celebrations . It commemorates the day in 1940 when the government replied ohi ( no ) to Italian Dictator Benito Mussolini 's ultimatum to allow his troops to occupy strategic points on Greek territory . Yet for a majority of Greeks Ohi Day came somewhat earlier this year . In a landslide election that brought to power the country 's first socialist government , Greeks last week not only said ohi to the conservative New Democracy party , which has ruled for the past seven years , but they also delivered a cryptic " maybe " to the U.S. and to two organizations of which Greece is a member : NATO and the European Community . <P> The man who caused concern in Western capitals with his spectacular victory and his nationalistic platform was Andreas Papandreou , 62 , who , ironically enough , is a former U.S. citizen . Leader of the Panhellenic Socialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wood-paneled Prime Minister 's office occupied by his more moderate father George , who headed three governments between 1944 and 1965 . With 48.6% of the vote to New Democracy 's 35.9% , PASOK won a majority of 172 seats in the 300-member parliament . In a nearly symmetrical reversal of fortunes , New Democracy , led by outgoing Prime Minister George Rallis , fell from 172 seats to 115 . Andreas , as the fiery winner is customarily called by his countrymen , was exuberant . " Change is necessary for the survival of the Greek nation , " he declared in a victory speech . " We will make change tangible ; it will show its face without delay . " <P> <P> That was precisely what worried many Americans and Western Europeans . Though Papandreou softened some of his more radical proposals in the past year , he has spoken out against the presence of four U.S. military bases in Greece , questioned Greek membership in NATO and opposed his country 's membership in the ten-nation European Community . For those who hope Papandreou 's actions in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his election-night speech contained an encouraging message . Said he : " We will not lead the country into any adventure . " <P> That attitude , together with the selection of moderates for his Cabinet , inspired a hopeful response from Washington . " It 's wait and see , " said one State Department official . " We are cooling it . We are not about to cast the first stone . " Europeans were equally cautious in their analysis . Noted one senior British diplomat : " The trend in almost all European countries is for a new leader , whether of the left or the right , to dilute the more radical policy pronouncements of his election manifesto and resort to good old pragmatism .
