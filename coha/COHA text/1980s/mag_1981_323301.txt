Many people these days keep an eye on the prime rate the way a baseball fan watches the major league standings . The prime rate , usually defined as the lowest interest rate that banks charge their most creditworthy customers , is no longer just an arcane financial statistic . It has become a subject for TV news commentators and cocktail-party conversations . <P> Few people actually borrow at prime . Loans to small , well-financed businesses , for instance , usually run from half a percentage point to three points above prime . Consumers who borrow to finance a vacation or pay taxes may pay three to five points more . Loans like those made to new-car buyers can be well above prime . On the other hand , interest on home mortgages , which now averages 16% , trails behind because such loans are issued for 20 to 30 years . <P> Nonetheless the prime rate remains the bench mark by which most people measure the cost of credit . But a new report by the House Banking , Finance and Urban Affairs Committee suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guide to what most borrowers-big or little - actually pay . The report , which mainly addresses the prime rate 's application to business borrowing , found that it rarely applies to large , profitable corporations . They can usually borrow money at three to four points below prime , a discount reflecting the importance of the volume of their business with their banks . <P> The committee found that during May 1980 more than 60% of the commercial loans granted by large New York banks were made at rates below the prime , then 17% . The average rate charged : less than 13% . Chairman Fernand J. St Germain maintains that the posted prime rate has now become an excuse for banks to jack up interest rates . <P> Even before the St Germain report , small businessmen across the U.S. were skeptical that the prime was really the best rate available . Snaps Robert Laughlin , a Portland , Ore. , food-equipment distributor : " The prostituted prime is nothing but greediness on the part of large banks . " Attorney Jackie Kleiner has filed suit against the First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial prime to discriminate among borrowers . Says Kleiner : " The prime rate is supposed to be the bank 's cost of obtaining money , plus a small profit . But it turns out that the profits are obscene . " <P> Some banks are now seeking to redefine the prime . New York 's Morgan Guaranty Trust has issued a definition that sounds as if it were drafted by committee : " The bank 's prime rate shall mean the rate of interest publicly announced by the bank in New York from time to time as its prime rate . " Translation : the prime is whatever we say it is.
