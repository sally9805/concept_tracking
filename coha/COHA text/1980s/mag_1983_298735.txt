Ronald Reagan pays a lot of attention to what public opinion polls say , including those soundings taken by the White House . If these show him standing low with women , blacks and Hispanics , he is soon on television protesting that he has been misrepresented . If polls show people nervous about his foreign policy , Reagan turns up in a jauntily tilted overseas cap at veterans ' conventions . <P> " If I were President of the U.S. , " Irving Kristol wrote recently in the Wall Street Journal , " my first commandment to my staff would be : Thou shalt not permit a pollster on the premises . " Kristol is a onetime leftist who long ago turned neoconservative ( in his autobiography , Literary Critic Irving Howe recalls how he and Kristol held forth in Alcove No. 1 of the City College lunchroom in contentious dispute with fellow radicals , among them Trotskyites , socialists and other Marxist deviants , while Stalinists crowded into Alcove No. 2 ) . Kristol 's is a familiar and not discreditable shift in political outlook : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he ever got , but it did leave him with a certain tendentiousness in arguing . Thus , he complains that the " liberal media Establishment , " by which he means the networks , the newsmagazines , the New York Times , etc. , has " co-opted the opinion-polling profession , " causing it to conduct " absurdly simple-minded polls . " Presumably Kristol finds these poll questions more simplistic than Reagan 's own explanations of his policies . <P> An ABC News-Washington Post poll shows that when there are conflicting versions of events in Central America , 49% believe TV and newspaper reports , while 37% believe Reagan . Kristol regards Central America as " perhaps the most flagrant case " of polk confusing the public and inhibiting proper presidential action : " If the Administration believes it is crucial that Central America not go Castroite , it should say so emphatically , argue the case clearly , and then do what has to be done swiftly and successfully . " Such macho rhetoric often goes flabbily vague at the critical moment : Does " what has to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Certainly there is much public confusion , ignorance and volatility about Central America . A CBS News-New York Times poll in June showed that only 8% knew which sides the U.S. supports in El Salvador and Nicaragua . The better informed were the more opposed to deeper involvement . Edward R. Tufte , a Yale professor of political science , concludes that since Viet Nam , Presidents can no longer count on uninformed loyalty : Reagan 's problem is that he suffers from " uninformed skepticism and informed hostility , " Yet Democratic presidential candidates are wary of this foreign policy issue , perhaps seeing themselves some day in the dock to answer , " Who lost Central America ? " Tufte marvels that the Reaganites have successfully persuaded their Democratic rivals , Washington insiders and " the 50,000 people who matter " that the Reagan people " are really tuned in to America , " even though , in polls measuring how well he is doing his job , Reagan consistently ranks with Carter among the lowest of postwar Presidents .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
