This story has been entered on the data base in 2 parts . This is part 2 . Craig ' s wheels grind slowly in a rapid-fire medium , but a look at the body of his work in Chicago reveals a prescience for news and public issues : - In 1968 , while at WMAQ , he produced " The Quality of Justice , " a hard look at the Chicago court system four years after the celebrated " judicial reform " of 1964 . That story is being played out , 20 years later , in the " Operation Greylord " headlines , in the nearly 100 indictments handed down in recent months among judges , lawyers and courtroom characters. - In 1983 , he won a Peabody award for " Studebaker : Less Than They Promised . " Searching from the bottom up , from the perspective of a working- class Indiana family , Craig examined the 1963 collapse of the Studebaker automobile empire and the human impact of the closing of its South Bend plant . Craig ' s anniversary story of corporate betrayal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Rust Belt " reality of Midwestern heavy industry. - In 1981 , Craig and Bill Kurtis offered " Watching the Watchdog , " a one-hour documentary on the techniques of television journalism that was , in Craig ' s words , " as controversial as anything I ' ve ever done . " In the piece for Channel 2 , Craig took on ABC ' s " 20/20 " and correspondent Geraldo Rivera for " ambush " interviews , Chicago ' s Better Government Association for sloppy reporting in an examination of an alleged arson-for-profit scam , and local journalistic architects of the famous " Mirage " bar investigation , in which local news organizations opened a North Side saloon to dig up evidence of municipal corruption . " I made a few enemies with that one , " Craig said , " It was the most controversial piece I ever did , I guess . People at ABC in New York and some people right here wanted to punch me in the nose . " In 1980 , Craig offered " Give Me the Keys , " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public schools . That topic , as much as any other , has been the producer ' s passion in Chicago . A one-hour documentary on the subject he developed for WMAQ in 1975 never aired . At the time , the stated reason was that Craig was perceived to have violated the Illinois eavesdropping law . The decision , which Craig accepted , was the product of contrary legal opinions inside NBC and , in the producer ' s eyes , a felicitous opportunity for station management to dodge a controversial issue . Craig kept his notes . At Channel 2 , he has twice returned to the public- school issue , first with " The Class of ' 84 , " a wrenching examination of the educational tragedy being played out at South Shore High School . In 1987 , Craig came back to the South Shore story , though this time he was kept outside the school by an administration still reeling from the 1984 treatment . In both pieces , the immutable images of incompetent teachers , semi- literate students and intransigent administrators mock the current self- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Craig told stories , stories of lost students , disaffected teachers and educators more interested in protecting turf than in improving the quality of education . On camera , he interviewed high-school students for whom the word " desolate " was a challenge beyond their powers of comprehension or pronounciation . He turned up a course curriculum shot through with 55 grammatical and spelling errors , written by a department head . Craig ' s documentary eye is rarely tinged with anger , but much of his work reflects a strong populist sensibility . Give him an hour to examine Illinois and you will see far more of Downstate family farmers than you will of the state ' s leading politicos . Let him look at the collapse of Chicago ' s Continental Bank , as he did for PBS ' " Frontline " series in 1985 , and he will start with the oil-boom hustlers and shopping-center banks of Oklahoma in the 1970s . In recent years , Craig has produced five documentaries for Turner Broadcasting , including four one-hour specials for its ambitious " Portrait of America " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giangreco worked up evocative perspectives on Illinois , Wisconsin , Ohio and Michigan . " Scott has a style that is uniquely his , I think , " said Ira Miskin executive producer for programming at TBS . " It ' s not highly stylized , not the bang-and-run sort of documentary-making you see in New York or on the West Coast . " It ' s straight , it ' s thought all the way through and , by finding people to tell stories , Craig is able to get right at what he wants to say . " Citing an example , Miskin recalled moments in the Illinois " Portrait " where Craig tried to address the imprint of Abraham Lincoln on the state . " How do you do that for television ? " Miskin wondered aloud . " Still pictures and historical data often don ' t work very well . " What Scott did was find a judge in downstate Illinois who was a great authority on Lincoln . And he wrapped it up as a human story , a generational story of this judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott found an environment in which a story could be told , which is something he does like no one else . " " There ' s no question that I can construct stories better if they ' re people stories , " Craig says . " Years ago , a radio reporter named Joe Cummings came to me with an idea about a group of Catholic priests from a class in Mundelein . He told me maybe I ought to look at what had gone on with these guys . " That idea led to " Once A Priest , " a 1977 documentary for Channel 2 about the religious and personal fates of 10 priests from the class of 1957 at St. Mary ' s of the Lake Seminary . It earned Craig his first Dupont-Columbia award . His story-telling skills mapped out the furor within the Catholic Church over the issues of celibacy , racism and relevance , all from the private perspectives of five men who chose to leave the priesthood , and five who chose to stay . Like " Studebaker , " " Once A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentaries in a medium where documentaries are seldom being made anymore , Craig relishes his role as " dinosaur . " " I ' ve always been the dinosaur , " he said , smiling . " There ' s nothing new there . In Chicago , the stations have competed on different levels , prestige being one of those levels . And that ' s helped make a career for me . I don ' t have any illusions about it . " That ' s my role , at 2 and at 5 . Winning the Peabody and the Duponts and the Emmys , that ' s all part of it . When you do what I do , using up time and money and film crews , there might not be the ratings pressure , but you ' re expected to hit the ball over the fence every time . So you want the crowd to cheer , in a sense . " The crowd and the critics cheer far more often than they disdain Craig ' s work . And , 20 years on , the documentarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the television game as the sharp-pencils assume control of the broadcast industry . " You know , " he said , " I love the diversity of cable TV . In the old days , the networks and the stations were paternalistic . If you stepped out of line , they ' d warn you that the money might run out , then where would you be ? Outfits like Turner have changed that by offering some options . " So Craig keeps looking for his stories , and telling them . In the modern television era , documentary makers seem to spend half their time begging and the other half complaining about the moribund state of their art . Neither role suits Craig . " I might be around long enough to see it ( the hour-long documentary ) come back , " he said . " Then again , maybe I won ' t . Either way , it ' s not going to change what I do .
