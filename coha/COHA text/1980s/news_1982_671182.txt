Some of these camp inmates were ordinary criminals such as murderers and thieves . But others , such as Mr. Uspensky himself , were in the camp for political reasons ; they were dissident scientists , writers , and artists - people who had once been in the most honored and responsible positions in the country and whose Russian should have been perfect . Mr. Uspensky ' s inability to comprehend the common speech of both types of inmates led him to a monumental task that , morethan two decades later , he is near finishing in the United States. // Mr. Uspensky , a former military officer who managed to immigrate to this country in 1979 and is now an associate of the Russian Research Center at Harvard , is compiling a massive dictionary of " nenormativnaya leksika , " or what he calls " unconventional Russian , " the inventive , pungent , irony-laden vernacular of unofficial Soviet life. // For most languages in most countries , that would be an ambitious , but innocuous , scholarly undertaking . A dozen major works on American slang have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example. // // Has a Political Dimension // But , Mr. Uspensky ' s work on Russian slang takes on an important political dimension . No comprehensive dictionary of unconventional usage has ever been published in the Soviet Union , apparently because Russian slang - like that of other languages - derives not just from the patter of everyday life but from what can fairly be described as the shadows of society ; it is the semi-clandestine language of criminals and dissidents alike , the lexicon of unconventional mores and ideas that have been accorded no official existence in the Soviet Union. // In this sense , Mr. Uspensky ' s dictionary mirrors aspects of Soviet society that have generally been the subject of dissident writings , published , as Mr. Uspensky ' s dictionary will be , abroad . While he began with the language of criminals and the labor camps , Mr. Uspensky has also collected the technical jargon of professional groups , the slang of prostitutes , the code words and phrases of teen-agers , the bitter-sweet linguistic inventions of intellectuals as they face the might of political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West is the powerful streak of popular skepticism about the claims of socialism that emerges from the language of the street . " In vernacular speech there are a lot of expressions that are in themselves extremely critical of aspects of Soviet life , " Mr. Uspensky said. // Street Russian , for example , is full of jaded commentary on the Soviet system . The special apartment houses built for party leaders are mockingly called " houses of the village poor . " A membership card in the Communist Party is " a ration card , " reflecting the privileged access to supplies that Party members have in shortageprone Soviet society . The bust of Karl Marx in central Moscow is commonly known as " the scarecrow. " // A host of words and phrases refers , ruefully , to the K.G.B. , the security police . " Gregory Borisovich , " a kind of Russian John Doe , is a common name for a K.G.B. agent as is the term " the hairy ear . " " K.G.B. jazz " is a name given to jammed radio broadcasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone who listens to bugged conversations. // In all , Mr. Uspensky has compiled some 50 , 000 entries showing this politically loaded terminology and many other slang usages . Eventually , they will be printed in three volumes totaling about 2 , 500 pages . They include the idiom of criminals and bureaucrats , of such occupational groups as sailors , carpenters and actors , and of such diverse subgroups as black marketeers , alcoholics and drug addicts . They contain technical jargon - in military usage , for example the term " little fish " means a blip on a radar screen - and the earthy , obscene argot of the streets . <> <> Other Volumes Planned // Mr. Uspensky ' s work , when finished , will consist of a dictionary entirely in Russian that he hopes will be off the press in about a year and a half , although the publisher has yet to be determined . Fluent in English , he plans in about three years to complete a companion volume of some 5 , 000 to 6 , 000 items of unconventional Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be far more comprehensive than " Soviet Prison Camp Speech : a Survivor ' s Glossary " compiled by Meyer Galler and Harlan E. Marquess and published in this country in 1972. // Some examples , cited and translated into English by Mr. Uspensky , show how unconventional Russian ranges from the idioms common in any society to terms revealing the special nature of Soviet life. // The most common source of idioms is in the jargon of criminals and was absorbed by other groups who spent time in the labor camps for political reasons . " To throw away your hooves " is one of the many phrases meaning " to die . " Information given to the police by an informer is " a knock " ; the word informer itself has some 30 to 50 slang equivalents , says Mr. Uspensky , including she-dog , snake , whore and the word " Seksot , " a contraction of the two Russian words for secret collaborator . <> <> Full of Coarse Irony // The slang that emerges from Mr. Uspensky ' s research often displays a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ivan the Terrible , " is a name given to the standard gynecological examining table , and derives , Mr. Uspensky says , from the roughness of treatment at state medical institutions . For much the same reason , an abortion is " a scratch . " The term " May Day , " the holiday when red flags appear everywhere , is used sardonically by Russian women to mean the onset of menstruation. // There are also numerous expressions deriving from the imprisonment of dissidents in psychiatric hospitals in the Soviet Union . The word " doghouse " is used for the ward where violent patients are put . The " psychodrome " is the exercise yard. // Mr. Uspensky is uniquely qualified for his lexicographic project . Born in 1915 in Petrograd - the present Leningrad - he spent 12 years in the Red Army , including service as an intelligence officer in World War II . He had a foretaste of police terror in 1938 when he was arrested by N.K.V.D. police , accused of being a German spy , beaten unconscious , and then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Separate Camps // By 1960 , established as a writer in Leningrad , Mr. Uspensky was arrested again and sentenced to a five-year term for " anti-Soviet activity . " He served four years of that term in four separate labor camps in the Mordovian Autonomous Republic , all of them maximumsecurity prisons with barbed wire , watchtowers , armed guards and electronic tripwires to deter would-be escapees. // Still , Mr. Uspensky says that he was " lucky " to have experienced the labor camps " at a relatively liberal time , " when , unlike today , prisoners were allowed books and could engage in their own literary projects . On his release from the camp , Mr. Uspensky took with him 14 , 000 note cards on which he had recorded prison argot . He continued his work at home in Leningrad , reading and interviewing and , above all , expanding the scope of his research beyond the language of the criminal world . Fearful that his files might be discovered by the police , he photographed them and , with the help of an American friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1978 , Mr. Uspensky says , the police had searched his home twice . " Luckily they didn ' t come across my card files . " Once , he was verbally assaulted on the streets by three men who , he assumed , were K.G.B. agents . " My work , " he says , " had become the goal of my life ; I had to leave the country in order to save it . " <> <> Obtained a Jewish Passport // Mr. Uspensky , who wrote in the Soviet Union under the pen name Kirill Kostsinsky , applied for emigration , claiming , falsely , that he was Jewish . At that time , large numbers of Jews were being allowed to leave the Soviet Union . In any case , he said , referring to the Soviet authorities , " they wanted to get rid of me . " Permission to emigrate came in only 10 days. // Mr. Uspensky contends , ironically , that to have been a labor camp inmate was in the end a rewarding experience . " To gain something out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , " he said . " When I found myself in the camp , I tried to get maximum use of it for myself . And , in a way , I did. " // " It will seem rather funny , " he added , " but when I prepare the manuscript for publication , I will thank the K.G.B. for giving me the possibility to peep into that strange and , until then for me , unknown world.
