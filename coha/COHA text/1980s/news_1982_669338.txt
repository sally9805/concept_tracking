Also present will be a type of art that would have been totally incomprehensible fifty years ago ( except possibly to Picasso , Miro , and a few of the Surrealists ) and is still considered ' ' beyond the pale ' ' by some members of the art community today. // I am referring to work that is defined neither by its resemblance to nature nor its adherence to a formal ideal . That seems formless , ' ' spineless , ' ' and painfully ' ' organic . ' ' And that , to the cynical eye , resembles nothing so much as shapeless ' ' doodles ' ' of clay , stumps of wood studded with rusty nails and hung with string , yards of dirty , drooping canvas , or huge roots pulled out of the earth and painted yellow or blue. // The kind of art , in other words , that traces its spiritual ancestry to the sculptural ideas of Eva Hesse and Joseph Bueys , to Jackson Pollock ' s compulsive eruptions , and beyond them to many of the primal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its identity totally through intuition and curiosity , not accepting the disciplines of geometry or pattern , and that emerges into being through a process that dramatically parallels the actual process of organic growth. // It ' s difficult for many to accept this kind of work as art because it seems so pointless and formless , so lacking in any evidence of skill or control . Where , they ask , is the proof that human intelligence and sensibility shaped these odd-looking things that look as though they had been picked up out of the street . They couldn ' t , they insist , have been ' ' created , ' ' they could only have ' ' happened. ' ' // It ' s an interesting point . If these ' ' shapeless ' ' things are art , why wouldn ' t a pebble , found on a beach , or a piece of gnarled driftwood also be art ? If a primary ingredient of art is evidence upon it of human intelligence or sensibility , isn ' t it crucial that all art bear at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies in the type of ' ' evidence ' ' we demand , and the particular thematic or formal ideal against which the work is to be judged . For some of us , an incredible amount of ' ' evidence ' ' is required before we accept something as art . It must bear proof of extraordinary skill , and be executed in exquisite detail . Or it must magically resemble a real object , person , or place . Or , in the case of an abstraction , it must reflect the formal ideals of the movement to which its creator belongs. // But what if something genuinely new comes along ? Something that looks like nothing on earth ? How would we determine its legitimacy as art ? Against what standards or ideals would we weigh it ? // It would be a problem , but not as big a one as it would have been before the time of the Impressionists , when newness in art had a very limited meaning . We today have the ' ' advantage ' ' of a cultural prejudice toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give the odd-looking thing before us the benefit of the doubt. // But how would this help us in the long run ? Isn ' t a categorical acceptance of anything new just as bad as an automatic rejection of it ? This is a serious matter - especially in a world and at a time that insists that subway graffiti are an important art form that can not be compared negatively with other forms of art . And that tends to accept the word of every self-proclaimed ' ' artist ' ' that whatever he produces is art simply because he says it is. // We are tottering on a razor ' s edge as far as our perception of new art is concerned . On the one hand , we hate to say ' ' no ' ' to the new for fear of thwarting creativity . And , on the other , we hate to say ' ' yes ' ' too easily or quickly for fear it would cause our critical standards to erode. // It ' s a standoff , and a very difficult position for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s precisely where many of us find ourselves these days when confronted by works that appear to lack all intelligible form and purpose , and that seem to have been ' ' found ' ' rather than created. // It ' s a particular problem of mine , since I prefer things to be clear and logical , and capable of being rationally comprehended . And yet , I ' ve discovered that opening myself up to new ways of perceiving art is not difficult once I ' ve set my mind to it. // I ' ve found that remaining in a work ' s presence for long periods can be very helpful in beginning to understand it - just as I ' ve found that leaving and returning to it frequently can gradually give me some indication of its identity . As the work becomes more familiar , it begins to reveal its character and ' ' personality . ' ' It slowly becomes more whole and intact , or more chaotic and pointless . I may not know at this stage exactly what and how good it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to knowing if it has a clear formal and thematic identity , or if it is just a piece of junk. // Prolonged periods of looking , and frequent return visits to her work , were the methods I used to familiarize myself with the intentions and qualities of Nancy Graves ' s art . I was intrigued but perplexed by her sculptures of camels , and then , a bit later , by her clusters of large , upright bones . I liked them well enough , but couldn ' t relate them to my own feelings and ideas about art. // What I did get from them was a feeling of something very old whose time had come and gone , and whose existence was now being memorialized through a series of fossil-like sculptures . But that feeling gradually dissipated over the next few years as I saw more of her work , and began to realize that she was not limited to one set of ideas , but was actually a free and far-ranging creative soul of great curiosity and considerable imagination. // What most impressed me was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run its course , and then to approach a new one just as eagerly and devotedly . When she was doing camels , bones , and ceremonial-type hangings , she was the total sculptor , giving life and form to certain sculptural and conceptual ideals . But when , a little later , she started doing gouaches of undersea creatures , map-like pictures of the moon , calligraphic paintings , and even films , she was equally committed to them. // In her latest work she has once again gone off at a tangent in the form of brightly colored , free-form polychrome sculptures . These are made up of such cast objects as fish , fans , leaves , flowers , bubblewrap , vegetables , lampshades , string , and paper , which are then cut , bent , and connected by welding or soldering. // The overall effect is peculiarly organic - in a vaguely science-fiction sort of way . We feel that these standing structures could easily have come from a strange planet , for there is an internal logic to them that is recognizable and yet foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sophisticated , with a sculptural presence that would have been incomprehensible to Brancusi or Rodin , and beneath contempt to Michelangelo. // And yet they represent an attitude toward art in general , and toward sculpture in particular , that is becoming increasingly popular with many of our better younger artists who seem perfectly at home with this sort of free-form , nongeometric , and ' ' soft ' ' kind of art . From Niki de Saint Phalle and Nancy Graves to Judy Pfaff , and from them to large numbers of youngsters just starting out , art means the working out and projection of feelings and ideas in forms that violate premodernist ( and even some modernist ) artistic traditions as much as any have . And that ' s all to the good , for it promises some fascinating things for tomorrow. // //
