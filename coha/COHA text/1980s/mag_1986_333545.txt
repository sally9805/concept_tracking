This week 's cover story on the stock market and its gyrations was not a task for a numberphobe or the technologically faint of heart . " After nuclear proliferation , this is the most complicated cover I 've ever tackled , " says Associate Editor George Russell , who wrote the story . Following a stint as TIME 's Buenos Aires bureau chief from 1979 to 1981 , Russell returned to write in the World section for five years , then switched last March to Economy &; Business . " Wars and coups are very decisive  --  stories tend to write themselves when people are killing each other , " he observes . " It is tougher to write about seemingly ordinary topics like the stock market that are much more extraordinary than people might think . The stock market is at the center of the most sophisticated financial system in the world . Trying to simplify this chaos and make it comprehensible was not easy . " <P> Among Russell 's biggest challenges : understanding not only how state-of-the- art computers and other technological marvels contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He received able assistance in New York City from Senior Correspondent Frederick Ungeheuer , who served as Russell 's eyes and ears , visiting trading rooms and exchange floors as brokers wheeled and dealed .

" In just over two decades , there has been change much like the one from horse-and-carriage days to jet travel . " Senior Reporter- Researcher Bernie Baumohl , who also assisted with the story , compares the historic upheaval to the Industrial Revolution . Says he : " The question is Will we  --  bankers , brokerage firms and , ultimately , small investors  --  be able to adjust ? " <P> So far , nobody has the answer . The most that can be said is that people are hustling to keep up with the pace of change around them . Says Senior Editor Charles Alexander , who heads TIME 's Economy &; Business section and oversaw the cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street more and more bewildering . While we can not take away the bewilderment , we can give our readers a better sense of what is going on , why , and whether they should be worried . " Alexander , for his part , assiduously avoids speculating about the future of the stock market . " The question I am most frequently asked by colleagues , friends and relatives is ' Where is the market going ? ' My answer is ' Beats me. ' "
