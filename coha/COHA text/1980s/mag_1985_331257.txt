" German Art in the 20th Century , " the huge show of some 300 works by 52 artists that has been the talk of London since it opened at the Royal Academy in October , has a clear agenda . It wants to prove something , and that something is continuity , from 1905 to 1985 . <P> The usual view of German modernism , which prevailed until quite recently , tells a very different story . It depicts young outsiders who are rapturously expressive in their rebellion against painterly norms before World War I and bitterly sardonic in their attacks on society after it . These artists rehearse the last phase of the exaltations and terrors of German romanticism . They are seen , by all but a tiny minority of Germans , as mad , bad and dangerous to know : frantic orphans of the fatherland , nut eaters , Nietzscheans , stargazers , communards , Spartacists , reciting overloud yeas to nature and nays to society . Among them are Ernst Ludwig Kirchner and Franz Marc , Emil Nolde and Karl Schmidt-Rottluff , George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they try to construct withers in the red glare of National Socialism . After 1933 their story becomes a lugubrious tale of giants in exile ( Oskar Kokoschka , Kurt Schwitters , Max Beckmann ) , of ruined hope , lopped lives and rampant state philistinism . By 1945 there is no life left in the expressionist impulse , at least in Germany ; it can only be reborn in America as abstraction , and then re-exported to exhausted Europe . By 1955 figurative expressionism is a dodo  --  shot by Hitler , eaten by art history , its bones a museum specimen . Thus spake , until lately , the scenario . <P> But real events have a way of belying scenarios , and in the past few years the most striking and heavily publicized trend in German art has been back to the very kind of painting that obsessed the German avant-garde before 1914 : fervent , ejaculatory , based on the human figure and full of pretensions toward expressive plangency and " primitive " directness . There has been a like revival of the kind of acrid satire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sachlichkeit ( New Objectivity ) painters in the ' 20s . The image stream of German expressionism went underground , but not even Nazism could dry it up . It is the deep , continuous current of German modernism ; it picks up different names , en route through the century ; and here it is again , manifested in the work of painters like Georg Baselitz , Anselm Kiefer and , above all , its titular river-god , Joseph Beuys . <P> ; How persuasively does " German Art in the 20th Century " support this argument ? As conceived by Norman Rosenthal , the exhibitions secretary at the Royal Academy , the first part of the show  --  painting and sculpture between 1905 and 1933  --  makes a brilliant case . ( It especially needed to be made in London , which has not had a major survey of German expressionism since 1938 . ) Admittedly , there are some weak patches at the beginning . For some reason , the curators did not include any of the triptychs that were Beckmann 's crowning achievement as a pictorial fabulist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three works as good as Aerial Acrobats , 1928  --  a Goya-like capricho rendered with grandly menacing stolidity  --  a visitor might not grasp why Beckmann could be considered the greatest German artist of the 20th century .
