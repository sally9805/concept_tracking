All summer long John Kennedy had brooded , waiting for Nikita Khrushchev to make good on his threat to get rid of " the bone in my throat "  --  partitioned Berlin . But he had not anticipated what would happen on that warm August afternoon in 1961 when he set out from Hyannis Port , Mass. , on the yacht Marlin loaded with family and his favorite picnic dish , fish chowder . <P> When the flash came from Washington that the Wall was going up , the Army major on duty became so agitated that he walked into the surf in full uniform ! to deliver the bulletin to Brigadier General Chester Clifton , the President 's military aide , who was swimming just offshore . <P> Clifton signaled the Marlin back and handed Kennedy the terse message . " You all go ahead , " J.F.K. told his family . " I wo n't be out . " He climbed into a golf cart with Clifton and in silence rode to his house . " Why in hell did n't we know about it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What can we do ? " he asked , turning to Clifton . " What can the military do ? " Clifton told him that out of some 40 contingency plans for Berlin , he could not recall a single one dealing with a wall being built between the Soviet and Allied sectors . In fact , there was not much he could do . <P> Later , in the Oval Office , he sighed that the Wall would stay until the Soviets tired of it . " We could have sent tanks over and knocked the Wall down , " he mused . " What then ? They build another one back a hundred yards ? We knock that down , then we go to war ? " <P> When Kennedy did see the Wall , the event became one of the great spectacles of the cold war , his speech one of the most memorable in his presidency . When Kennedy flew into Berlin that June morning , he had a text that did not please him . " You think this is any good ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had joined the Kennedy caravan.Polk scanned the speech and replied bluntly , " I think it is terrible . " Kennedy agreed and began to write a new one . But before he taunted the builders of the Wall , he rode four hours through the streets of West Berlin in the midst of a human fury of adoration intensified by the city 's constant isolation . Nothing before in Kennedy 's exuberant political life had approached this demonstration of between 1 million and 2 million cheering , roaring Germans . <P> At Checkpoint Charlie he asked that family members and other guests not climb up to the viewing stand . Mouth set , Kennedy studied the strange , gray emptiness before him . Then , in far windows in East Berlin apartments , three women appeared waving handkerchiefs . " Is n't that kind of dangerous ? " wondered Kennedy . Yes , he was told . Kennedy stood several seconds in tribute to those tiny figures . <P> The crowd that waited for him to speak in front of West Berlin 's city hall occupied every foot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jaw and chopped the air with his hand , his voice growing ragged as he shouted his challenges to the other world and answered with his famous $ refrain , " Let them come to Berlin . " In that moment the tribute Kennedy gave to those people was as honorably held , as profoundly pure as anything he had ever said . It was made of truth and given to history . " Ich bin ein Berliner . "
