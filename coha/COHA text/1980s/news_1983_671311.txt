" The people have reason to pause and reflect on the state of our civilization when they hear about a mother charged with manslaughter in the beating death of her 2 1/2-year-old daughter , " Professor Giannell wrote in an August 1978 letter to The Watertown Daily Times . " What happened recently is only a sample of an unbelievable high incidence of child abuse that occurs every day . " <> <> ' There Isn ' t Any Answer ' // // About 10 days ago , the police say , that same Professor Giannell shot to death his 13-year-old son , Steven Jr. ; shot and then stabbed to death his 16- year-old daughter , Robin , and then stabbed himself to death. // " The big question is , ' Why ? ' " the Rev. Theodore Schulze asked during funeral services . " What goes on inside people ? " The minister spoke directly to Professor Giannell ' s wife , Mary , as if no one else were present : " The answer given to Job is that there isn ' t any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all the other answers are dangerous . So let ' s forget the unanswerable question ' Why ? ' " // But people here can not forget it - why an expert on violence succumbed to the most violent behavior of all , why the child of a child psychology teacher was given to such destructive tantrums that the police had to be called to restrain him. // And they can not forget Professor Giannell himself . For 25 years a college professor in this college town , he was nonetheless an outsider. // In a flood of letters over the years to The Courier &; Freeman , Potsdam ' s weekly newspaper , he assailed almost all the local officials , from the Mayor to the Building Inspector. // He was constantly feuding with someone about something and constantly threatening lawsuits over the most minor of matters. // " He was a good teacher , though he did have an individuality that was not easily accepted , " said Harry E. Kristiansen , the retired chairman of Potsdam ' s psychology department . " He was a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 61-year-old professor and his two children were discovered at 8 : 45 P.M. on Dec. 19 in their one-story white house at 6 Hillcrest Avenue , just a block from the State University campus. // The police in this village , 150 miles northeast of Syracuse , broke in after Mrs. Giannell , who they said was living in Florida , called them to say no one had answered the telephone at the house for two days . <> <> ' It Was a Shambles ' // " She had sued him for divorce , " Robert H. Halliday , the lawyer for Professor Giannell , said . " We denied her charges of cruel and inhuman treatment . " Mrs. Giannell , who had been a student of the professor , married him in 1965 , a year after she graduated. // Inside the house , Police Chief Clinton R. Matott said , " It was a shambles - books , magazines , papers all over the place , the Christmas tree overturned. " // " It was the kind of thing the boy was prone to - smashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He ' d wreck everything he got his hands on . The boy was given to these bad tantrums - violence against the father . But things took a bad turn after the death of the boy ' s grandmother . It seemed quite evident that he blamed the father. " // Professor Giannell ' s 85-year-old mother , Flora , lived with the family until she died while swimming in the backyard pool last April . The medical examiner said that she had suffered a heart attack while swimming and that no foul play was suspected. // " The last time I talked to him , about five weeks ago , " Chief Mattot said , " it was quite evident that the strain of the whole thing with the boy was taking its toll . He wasn ' t what I would call totally rational. // The Police Chief said the boy had probably had a tantrum . " With the separation and the problems with the boy , the father just snapped and decided to end the whole situation , " he said . " That ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the problem , they kill everybody. // " I felt all along the boy was potentially dangerous and offered to help have him hospitalized , " the Chief said . " But he felt he could handle it . " The police said the evidence - shell casings , fingerprints , wound positions - supported only their theory. // But some people here refuse to accept the police version , and everywhere in Potsdam there are theories on the Giannell killings - theories that an intruder committed them , theories that the boy killed his father and his sister , then himself . <> <> ' The Kids Could Do No Wrong ' // " He was so devoted to those kids that he wouldn ' t have touched a hair on their heads , " a fellow member of the university ' s psychology department said of Mr. Giannell . " If Steve had a fault , it was that the kids could do no wrong . Steve never disciplined the kids. " // Much of Professor Giannell ' s philosophy , including the disciplining of children , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freeman. // " As my favorite psychologist says , " he wrote in April 1978 , most likely alluding to himself , " you don ' t correct teen-agers by throwing the book at them , but by reaching them and motivating them appropriately. " // Later , in April 1982 , he wrote : " On the everyday level , we must condemn those who minimize children ' s acts of animal aggression with a lackadaisical ' boys will be boys ' ( with girls sometimes more vicious ) or ignore them altogether . We must condemn the behavior of some parents whom I have observed , for example , to incite their children to aggression , hatred or cruelty. " // There are other writings , too , that are his only voice now - writings that give an insight into his life here. // He chose the role of the outsider , the person who always rocked the boat . " I think he got a kick out of it , " Mr. Halliday , the lawyer said. // But there are indications that was not always so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass had to be cut on a vacant lot he owned , he charged that village officials were picking on him and filed a $7 million suit , which was pending at his death. // Court papers filed on his behalf noted that he was an immigrant from Italy and said he had fought in World War II in the Italian underground. // " The sense of safety from oppression he thought to have found in Potsdam was false , " the papers said . " It does not take an expert to realize the unfolding of a bitter vendetta , especially when the champion of the people ' s rights is a foreigner who made good. ' // In scores of letters to the editor , he offered proposals for a system of " participatory democracy , " and he told of a " collusion among union bosses , bureaucratic bosses and political bosses .

" // With the approach of Christmas 1983 , Professor Giannell found himself facing divorce , fighting with village officials , struggling with the violent tantrums of a 13-year-old son. // It is almost certainly not the vision of a life in America that he had in the mid-1950 ' s , when he was new to this country , studying psychology at Bowling Green University in Ohio - a vision he hinted at years later in a letter to President Reagan : // " With the return of our country to her old pioneer spirit under your leadership , Mr. President , there will be no excuse for anyone to be poor in America .
