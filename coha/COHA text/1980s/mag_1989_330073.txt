Like some 150 other young children in the U.S. , 21-month-old Alyssa Smith was waiting for a new liver , her one chance to avoid death at an early age . Her prospects did not look bright , since the supply of livers taken from cadavers and suitable for transplant is critically slim . But last week a team of surgeons at the University of Chicago Medical Center gave the little girl from Schertz , Texas , her chance to live . And what seemed truly miraculous about the operation was the source of Alyssa 's new liver : her mother . <P> In a 14-hour procedure , the surgeons removed the fist-size left lobe from 29-year-old Teresa Smith 's liver and transplanted most of it into her daughter . The revolutionary technique  --  transplanting a liver from a living donor  --  had been performed in Brazil , Australia and Japan , but this was the first time it was tried in the U.S. Doctors have had a great deal of success in kidney , pancreas and bone-marrow transplants from living donors , and hope is rising that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Broelsch , who led the Chicago transplant team : " This surgery potentially opens up a whole new pool of donor organs for infants . It 's the first step in answering the problem of juvenile organ shortage . " <P> So far , both mother and daughter are doing well . Because the liver has the power to regenerate itself by forming new tissue , Teresa 's liver should grow back to its normal size . Similarly , baby Alyssa 's new liver should grow as she does . <P> The operation was not without serious complications . While the surgeons were removing part of Teresa 's liver , they tore her spleen and decided they had to remove it . The loss of the spleen means she will be slightly more susceptible to infections , and may have to take antibiotics for the rest of her life . To gain access to the liver , the doctors also had to remove Teresa 's gall bladder . As for the baby , she had to undergo a second operation to stop bleeding from her new liver . The doctors hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her daughter will be home for Christmas . <P> The dangers inherent in such complex transplants pose ethical dilemmas for the medical community . University of Chicago ethicists and physicians spent a year discussing whether doctors have the right to ask healthy parents to donate portions of their vital organs , even if it means saving the life of their child . Critics argue that there is no way parents can refuse such a request when under the pressure of having a dying child . For that reason , university officials required a two-week delay between the time Teresa and her husband John signed the consent forms and the date of the transplant , so that the family could reconsider the decision . " It was purely voluntary , " says Dr. Peter Whitington , a pediatric hepatologist on the transplant team . " I think this mother , even if she had greater complications , would believe she did the right thing . I believe this father , even if he lost his wife , would believe he did the right thing . " <P> Some families may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But for the Smiths , the risk was well worth the possible returns . Says Teresa : " Once you 've given someone a big piece of your heart , it 's easy to throw in a little bit of liver .
