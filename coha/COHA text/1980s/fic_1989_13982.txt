Morning . The rehearsal room . Three actors and a director , scripts in their hands , sitting around a table for a read-through of a play . ANITA , in her early 30s , Hispanic , quite pretty , plays " Sara . " NICK , in his late 40s , big , a former leading man gone to seed , plays " Lou . " CHESTER , in his late 20s but looking younger , handsome , slightly effeminate ( except when he acts ) , plays " Ted . " ALEC , the director , is in his late 20s but acts with an authority that suggests a man many years older . No hint that he is gay . ANITA SARA You 'll see . NICK LOU That 's just what I 'm afraid of . ANITA SARA It 's going to be fine . NICK LOU It 's going to be fine . This boy  --  this man  --  who has not spoken a word , not word one to me in fifteen years , will be here in five minutes to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  because why ?  --  because he 's going to shoot me with a gun . ANITA SARA Because I asked him to . p. 3 NICK LOU It 's that easy ? ( No response ) You asked him to . He must be crazy about you . ( Studies her ) You 're cuteyou 're more than cuteyou 're attractiveyou 're more than attractive ANITA SARA I 'm beautiful . NICK LOU Break my arm . You 're beautiful . Why are you doing this ? ANITA SARA Not for you . NICK LOU That , I 'm sure of . ANITA SARA Because Teddy needs a father . NICK LOU I made an offer . More than once . He said no . ANITA SARA You walked out on him . NICK LOU I walked out on his mother . It was summer . A lovely June day . I walked out on her . I did n't consider it a package deal . Apparently , he and his brother did . You 'd think that somewhere in the middle of fifteen years they 'd have learned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted , nervous but doing the best he can , walks into the drawing room . He looks around . " CHESTER TED ( Calls ) Hello ! p. 4 ANITA SARA That 's him . NICK LOU Which way out ? ANITA SARA You 're not frightened ? NICK LOU I 'm not ready to get shot . Even to please my children . ANITA SARA You have n't done much to please your children . NICK LOU If getting shot is the soultion , I 'm afraid I 'm going to have to fail them again . Thank God it 's Ted , not Barry . Have you met Barry ? ANITA SARA Of course ! They 're brothers . NICK LOU It has n't been that long . I know they 're brothers . ANITA SARA Fifteen years . NICK LOU I have an astonishing memory for sons . ANITA SARA Do you have more than two ? NICK LOU Are you an attorney ? ANITA SARA You never remarried ? CHESTER TED Anyone here ? NICK LOU How old are you ? ANITA SARA Twenty-three . NICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sizes her up )  --  your adultness ? p. 5 ANITA SARA I 'm sorry ? NICK LOU You 're so calm . So poised . Where does this degree of maturity come from in a twenty-three year old ? No offense . I have a reason to ask , the reason being , at forty-five , which is the age I will be approximately at my next birthday  --  actually forty-eight  --  I have not once displayed on any occasion  --  and I am CEO of a company with 400 people under me  --  but not once have I shown your degree of maturity and poise , Miss Armbruster . ANITA SARA Call me Sara . I 'll be right back . NICK LOU Do n't leave . ANITA SARA There 's some reading matter on the coffee table . ALEC ( Reads ) " She exits library to drawing room . Lou crosses to coffee table , looks down at magazines . " NICK LOU House &amp; Garden . Christ , let me out of here ! CHESTER TED Hi , you . ANITA SARA Hi , you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " CHESTER TED Cigarette ? ANITA SARA You know I do n't smoke . p. 6 CHESTER TED Ca n't blame me for trying . ANITA SARA You want me to take on your bad habits ? CHESTER TED Any bad habits . You have none , you know . ANITA SARA ( Sighs ) You 're not the first to point it out . CHESTER TED It drives other people crazy , too ? ANITA SARA It 's not my fault that I do n't have bad habits . CHESTER TED Your parents ' fault . ANITA SARA Probably . Is n't everything ? ALEC ( Reads ) " A meaningful exchange of glances . " CHESTER TED Is he here ? ( ANITA SARA nods ) I would n't be doing this  --  ANITA SARA I know . And I love you for it . CHESTER TED You love me ? ALEC ( Reads ) " He moves in on her . " ANITA SARA A figure of speech . CHESTER TED It 's Barry you really love , is n't it ? I 'm just a kid brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I have n't worked together before . Is that flatness of voice process or something else ? NICK I 'm feeling my way . ALEC Am I wrong , or is there a  --  what 's a good word ?  --  a distance that you feel  --  maybe " disdain " is the word I really want  --  NICK It 's an Anthony Rose Play . What am I supposed to say ? CHESTER Well , I think  --  ANITA There are a lot of laughs here for you , Nick  --  NICK ( Stiff ) I know where the laughs are  --  ANITA ( Continues )  --  while I 'm Miss Goody Two-Shoes . NICK ( Slightly nasty ) I realize that this is a stock and amateur classic  --  ALEC I take it you 've seen it in New York . NICK I was on the Coast . CHESTER Mary 's show ? NICK ( Bored ) Look , I 'm not saying  --  CHESTER You were great ! p. 8 ALEC Of course , a lot of what we see in sitcoms  --  quality sitcoms  --  began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to switch from David Mamet to Anthony Rose I might have reconsidered leaving L.A. ALEC I would also rather be doing American Buffalo . But you do n't live here and you do n't have to deal with a board of trustees and you were not around for my Sister Mary Ignatius production . ANITA I was . ( Begins to laugh . ALEC joins in , then CHESTER , until they are in an uproar , amid which THEY get their lines off . ) CHESTER You can not believe Anita ! Dracula . In drag . As a nun ! ANITA I do n't know how they let me come back to do this ! ALEC Did you think I was going to dump Mamet and you ? You were part of the package , sweetie . ( SHE throws him a kiss ) But this girl has to be nice . ( More laughs ) NICK Alec , I understand resident theater boards . But this was not the play I was signed for . ALEC Of course , this may just be a better play than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott did your part on Broadway . ( NICK glowers at CHESTER ) ALEC I can see where the jokes might put you off . See them perhaps as tempo . The beat . ( Taps his hand ) Tappity-tap-laugh . **33;2913;TOOLONG . But look behind the beat NICK At what ? ( Sighs , looks at script ) He has n't seen his two sons in fifteen years , so what does he do ? Tappity-tap , laugh ? ALEC Look behind the gags , Nick . NICK All I see are gags . Even about being scared . I do n't think he 's scared . I think he 's pleased with himself . ALEC That 's an interesting choice . Go for that . NICK I 've deserted my two sons , and when I see them for the first time in fifteen years I play self-satisfaction ? I 'll be lynched . ALEC What could motivate a man who has left his wife  --  and his small children  --  to feel self-satisfied in the circumstance of meeting these sons again as adults ? ( Long pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother 's version of him . An awful man . No redeeming features . But what do they do ? p. 10 NICK They revenge themselves . Or one of them , Barry  --  ALEC And the other son , Ted ? NICK He breaks with Barry . By the end of the play , he  --  he  --  ALEC There 's an implication , is n't there ? NICK He 's forgiven me ? ALEC So how does Lou feel ? NICK Christ ALEC In this war  --  the marital war over the possession of the children  --  one son , one of your two sons  --  NICK ( Slowly realizing ) Vindication . I feel vindication . ALEC Vin  --  di  --  cation . NICK I 'M Vindicated simply by the circumstance of Ted giving me a second chance . ALEC What could be more reasonable ? NICK But how does that explain the self-satisfaction ? ( A mischievous grin from ALEC . NICK is cheered . ) I do n't want to talk about it anymore . ALEC I think it 's a start , Nick . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with , Anthony Rose can not write women . ( Long pause ) ALEC That 's it ? ANITA I 'm not complaining . Neither can any other male heterosexual playwright . I can do her as a kind of symbol  --  OK ?  --  a Caucasian male 's ideal woman : half-hip , half-saint , half-madonna , half-daughter . ALEC Half-virgin , half-nymphomaniac , half-straight , half-lesbian ANITA What do you want ? She 's dreary , Alec . ALEC You sound very sure . ANITA Look , I know another greeting card when I see one . I design them for Hallmark . ( Less certain ) What am I supposed to think ? ALEC Let 's talk about this play for a minute . The Parent Lesson . Why do you think Mr. Rose called his play The Parent Lesson ? CHESTER Alec , I think " Ted " is the reason . ALEC " Ted " is the reason ? CHESTER The estranged son teaches the father the value of family . NICK Oh really , Chester ! ANITA It 's a farce . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that sounded commercial to a Broadway audience . If you want me to dig deeper  --  p. 12 NICK She 's making my point ! ANITA ( Continuing ) It 's not there ! CHESTER I do n't say we 're dealing with Strindberg here , but I recognize a lot of myself in " Ted . " ANITA Ches-terrr ! ( CHESTER shuts up ) ALEC One ground rule for these rehearsals , folks . I 'm the only one who has the right to intimidate , interrupt , or make you feel foolish and insecure . That 's my job . And I want to hear what Chester has to say . And , Anita , I would think you would want to , also . ( ANITA shrugs , defiant , but listens ) Even a " greeting card " has to be acted . CHESTER I see a lot of " Ted " in me . I really do . I daresay I would n't be as amusing , as he is under similar circumstances , but that 's theater . I do n't see anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you how sorry I am that cleverness has gone out of style . Movies today , all those helicopters and fire-fights when there used to be Lubitsch . Small wonder Schwarzenegger . You do n't need to speak English , or even a language , anymore . I should talk about " Ted , " should n't I ? ALEC ( Giggles ) Yes . p. 13 CHESTER And well do I know I 'm the only non-professional here . Nick , I 'm such a fan of yours  --  and not just Mary Tyler Moore . NICK That 's what people remember . CHESTER I adored Police Story ! NICK ( Grins ) When I was playing the young cop to the old cop or when I was playing the old cop to the young cop ? CHESTER You have such truth  --  It hardly matters in what . You 're staying at the Hyatt ? NICK Should n't I ? CHESTER Did you know I 'm assistant manager ? Anything . Anything you need ( The door opens . A man in his 50s , in a black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANTHONY ROSE . ) ALEC Can I help you ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Shy ) I must have the wrong roo  --  ( Closes the door before he finishes his line ) ALEC All right , boys and girls , now that we have learned all there is to learn  --  ( OTHERS chuckle )  --  Why do n't we take it from the top of the scene ? ( To ANITA ) From " You 'll see . " But on our feet this time . We 're not going to block it , we 're simply going to explore it . Shall we ? ( ACTORS rise with their scripts and start moving about . ANITA stops at a spot. ) p. 14 ANITA Here ? ALEC How did you know ? ANITA SARA You 'll see . NICK LOU That 's just what I 'm afraid of . ANITA SARA It 's going to be fine . ALEC I 'm going to stop and start . Let 's try an overlap there . Sara , you seem not as sure of yourself as before . ANITA Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm doing . ALEC Of course . ( pauses to think ) I believe the dynamic here  --  and the humor  --  lies in the fact that you , at twenty-plus , are the mature and calm one ; and Lou here , the **27;2948;TOOLONG CEO , is a nervous wreck . Again , please . ANITA I see . ANITA SARA You 'll see . NICK LOU That 's just what I 'm afraid of . ANITA SARA ( Overlaps ) It 's going to be fine . NICK LOU It 's going to be fine . This boy  --  this man who has not spoken a word , not word one to me in fifteen years  --  will be here in five minutes to see me for the first time in  --  in  --  because  --  because why ? Because he 's going to shoot me with a gun . ( Door opens . ANTHONY ROSE enters , unnoticed , stands watching in corner. ) p. 15 ANITA SARA Because I asked him to . NICK LOU It 's that easy ? You asked him to ? He must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than cuteyou 're attractiveyou 're more than attractive . NICK ( To ALEC ) Am I coming on to her ? ALEC Maybe it 's a little soon . NICK This does n't set it up for later when I come on to her ? ALEC Mmm too sleazy , I think . NICK He is sleazy . ALEC I do n't think so . NICK Give me a break . This man has abandoned his children ! What do you know ? You 're not even married . ALEC I think it might help if you approached this part just a little less as Nick , the father  --  you are a father ? NICK ( Proud ) I have four kids . ALEC Where are your children , Nick ? NICK You mean now ? ALEC Are they here in Kansas City ? NICK ( Annoyed ) No , no . They 're back home in Santa Monica . Two are . The other two live with their mother in Westport . No , one of them  --  well , both of them are off at school now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16 ALEC ( Stares at script ) Let 's go on . NICK ( Annoyed ) It 's not the same ! ( Glares at script ) ALEC Of course . NICK LOU He must be crazy about you . NICK ( To ALEC ) So what do I play here if I 'm not coming on to her ? ALEC She is your son 's girl , or so you think . The one thing you know about Ted is that he 's picked this very special girl  --  NICK I 'm impressed . ALEC ( Nods ) The evidence of your corporate , multi-national , CEO eyes is that your twenty-five-years-old son has picked a winner . NICK I am really impressed . ALEC I think so . NICK I 'm not coming on . I 'm proud . I 'm proud of my son . ALEC I really think so . NICK This is really a moment for me , is n't it ? I mean , not to run away with it , but for the first time in fifteen years I have the emotions of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 17 ALEC Butsomethingelse NICK It 's a veneer ! I 'm not the self-satisfied at all . Not really . ALEC But on the surface --  NICK Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . This is good . This is good . ALEC Let 's pick it up from " I 'm beautiful . " ( NICK looks up from his script at ANITA , spots ANTHONY ROSE in the corner ) ANITA SARA I 'm beautiful . ( ALL wait for NICK to read his line , but he has stopped dead . ANITA looks over at NICK . ) ANITA I 'm still beautiful , but I 'm getting older . ALEC ( Looks up from script at NICK ) Nick ? ( Turns to look where NICK is looking ) I beg your pardon , this is a private rehearsal . ANTHONY ROSE Hello , Nick . NICK ( A big , forced grin ) Can you fucking believe it ? ! Anthony Rose ! BLACKOUT p. 18 Act 1 , Scene 2 ACT I : Scene 2 Everyone around the table for a read-through , ANTHONY in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'S demeanor is shy , retiring , reactive , almost never the first to speak . Nonetheless , attention is focused upon him and the cast is noticeably more nervous . CHESTER TED It 's Barry you love , is n't it ? I 'm just the kid brother . ANITA SARA That 's right . CHESTER TED That 's right . ANITA SARA That 's it exactly . CHESTER TED No , it is n't . You 're making fun of me . ANITA SARA That 's right . CHESTER TED Is that what you 're doing to go  --  ( As CHESTER ) I 'm sorry . ( As TED ) Is that what you 're going to do ? Simply agree with me ? ANITA SARA That 's right . CHESTER TED On everything ? I hate it when you disagree with me by agreeing with me . ( As CHESTER ) Is that right ? ( Checks script ) Yes , dis-agree with me by a-greeing with me . I 'm sorry . ( As TED ) Where is the old bastard ? p. 19 ANITA SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHESTER TED When are you going to break down and say it 's me you really love ? ANITA SARA It 's you I really love . CHESTER TED You can be the most disagreeable woman . ( Quickly ) Do n't agree with me ! ALEC ( Reads ) " Ted looks tentatively toward the library . " ANITA SARA He wo n't bite . CHESTER TED I 'll bite . If Barry knew I was doing this he 'd kill me . It was your idea . ANITA SARA Actually , it was an idea that 's been hanging in the air between the two of you since I 've known you . CHESTER TED It 's hard to hide things from you . ALEC ( Reads ) " Ted , his eyes on Sara , starts to exit . He bumps into Lou , as he enters drawing room . " Nick Lou and Chester Ted ( Together ) Sorry . CHESTER TED ( Quickly ) I did n't mean that ! ALEC ( Reads ) " A long , awkward pause . " p. 20 ANITA SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Exits quickly . " CHESTER TED Nothing for me . NICK LOU Scotch . CHESTER TED On the rocks ! NICK LOU Did you get my present ? CHESTER TED Present ? NICK LOU The baseball . Authographed by Sandy Koufax . CHESTER TED Yes , I got it . I was fourteen . NICK LOU You never know about the mails . It was never acknowledged . CHESTER TED Thank you for the baseball . ( Pause ) NICK LOU Maybe this was a bad idea . CHESTER TED Maybe it is . NICK LOU I do n't quite know how to tell you this but I 'm dying . CHESTER TED I can live with that . NICK LOU I have a fatal disease . ( CHESTER TED grins ) I 'm lying . I 'm in perfect health . p. 21 CHESTER TED This was your way of breaking the ice ? NICK LOU You 've grown . CHESTER TED You were doing better with the fatal disease . NICK LOU How 's your mother ? ALEC ( To CHESTER ) Your reaction to that , remark is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like your girl . CHESTER TED She 's not my girl . NICK LOU Barry 's girl ? ( No response ) I was hoping he 'd come , too . CHESTER TED He does n't know about this . NICK LOU What does he do , Barry ? CHESTER TED For Christ 's sake , is Barry the reason you came ? Barry ! Barry ! Barry ! Why do n't you ask what I do ? NICK LOU What do you do ? ( Pause ) I know what you do . You 're an Assistant D.A . You joined the D.A . ' s office two years ago after you graduated from Harvard Law . You were third in your class . You were living with an undergraduate named Daisy who was an Art History major . You drank too much , but you 've cut down since , I 'm glad to know . Daisy was two-timing you with another Art History major . Everyone knew but you . She went off to Paris with him . ( A long pause ) p. 22 CHESTER TED I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother quit Harvard in his third year and bummed around . He wrote poetry . Two of his poems appeared in The Virginia Quarterly . He works as an editor at Random House . CHESTER TED Him , you get right . NICK LOU He was married to a waitress who had illusions of being an actress but who was really a waitress . That lasted six months . She 's still a waitress . Neither one of you are any good with women . CHESTER TED Is there a point to any of this ? NICK LOU I 'm not entirely the son of a bitch you think I am . CHESTER TED Exactly what kind of son of a bitch are you ? ( ALL look up from their scripts ) NICK Funny stuff . CHESTER Lovely . NICK I got ta tell you , the first time I saw this scene on stage  --  Tony , this is a scene ! George C.  --  and who was the kid again ? CHESTER Warren Beatty . ANITA No . CHESTER Warren Beatty . p. 23 NICK That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANTHONY ROSE not even I NICK Come on , Tony , you know what I 'm saying . CHESTER You do n't have to write any more . ( ALL look at ANTHONY , who just grins ) You 've made your contribution , Mr. Rose . It 's there for all time . The Parent Lesson must be being done at some theater in this country every day of the year . ANTHONY ROSE it 's not my favorite CHESTER You 've written so many . NICK You really have to write another , Tony . Movies are not what you 're about . ( A long , fidgety pause ) ALEC What brings you to Kansas City ? ANTHONY ROSE Business ( Long pause ) ALEC I 'm sure you have better things to do than sit in on rehearsals of The Saddle Mare Rep. But , speaking for the company , we would consider it an honor and a privilege --  ANTHONY ROSE I just happened to see an ad p. 24 ALEC Whatever time you can give us --  Would you mind talking a little about the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself NICK How long has it been ? This man and I go way back . Before he put on his first play , I used to go to clubs to see this man do standup . CHESTER You were a comedian ? ( ANTHONY shrugs ) NICK The shyest goddamn comic you ever saw ! You had some funny material , though . And a cult following . Everyone stole from you . Mort . Mike and Elaine . Woody . Lenny . ANTHONY ROSE Geilgud . Olivier . NICK ( Backs off ) Whatever . ALEC Can I ask you a question ? ( ANTHONY smiles ) Lou 's really not that good with women , is he ? You really did n't mean him to be as good as he appears to be . ANTHONY ROSE I did n't ? ALEC Of course , I am second to no one in my admiration of the seduction- of-Sara scene in two . But am I making this up , or is n't Lou more than a little surprised that she falls for him ? p. 25 ANTHONY ROSE In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think it 's stronger if Lou also has problems with women . Not unlike his sons . They are , after all , his progeny . It 's been tried the other way a million times : Lou , the scoundrel , the narcissist , the Don Juan . But did Don Juan start out as Don Juan ? Or did Don Juan start out having to prove something ? And , in line with that initial , but very real insecurity , he evolved into Don Juan . Not unlike the insecurity all of us around this table feel , at this very moment , in your presence , Mr. Rose . And yet , like Lou , we cover it up . Who would guess , by our behavior , our terror of you ? Who would guess the terror in Lou that has made him opt for ladies man instead of  --  what ?  --  family man ? ANTHONY ROSE food for thought ALEC I do n't want to interpret you falsely . ANTHONY ROSE Lou as a nebbishis that why you cast Nick ? NICK Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I : Scene 3 ANTHONY and ALEC sit alone at the rehearsal table . The time is late afternoon . ANTHONY ROSE the girl ALEC You think she 's too old ? I know " Sara " is younger , but on stage Anita looks younger . She did " Maggie the Cat " for me when I was here last season . And in our last production , she was Sister Mary Ignatius  --  ANTHONY ROSE A nun ? ALEC She 's a transforming actress . I use her every time I direct here . ANTHONY ROSE Puerto Rican ? ALEC She happens to be , yes . Actually , Panamanian . I 'm not making a statement by using her , of course . I have cast non-traditionally  --  absolutely nothing against it  --  but not in this case . So much minority talent , so much energy . The energy of the disenfranchised . Actors from the middle class , they 've lost their energy ! ANTHONY ROSE White actors from the suburbs have no energy ? ALEC She 's good . Anita 's good . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct ? ANTHONY ROSE she 's good , too p. 27 ALEC I 'm really happy with my choice . ANTHONY ROSE Nick ? ALEC Nick can be a pain in the ass , but he 'll be good in the part . Actors , young talented actors , studying , working in flea-bag theaters as they make their livings as bartenders or waiters or house-cleaners  --  the new menial class  --  while , at night , performing Shakespeare , Chekhov , Becket . Doing good , strong , developmental work . Unrewarded , unrecognized , as they hone their instruments . Until one day the break ! And off they go from Chekhov to Spielberg . From sense-memory to sit-coms and car chases . Famous . Rich . And never another day 's honest work . Nick 's problem is that he 's been out there too long . ANTHONY ROSE Me too . ALEC I 'm sorry . ANTHONY ROSE Lost my energy ALEC It 's really quite easy to say the wrong thing around you , is n't it ? ( Long pause ) Chester is a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anita or Nick . Anita was in New York for awhile . I worked with her there . Circle Rep. And then I did a workshop Coriolanus for Papp . I seem to be giving my resume . ANTHONY ROSE ( Smiles ) From sense memory to sit-com. p. 28 ALEC ( Flushes ) You dig far deeper than is generally acknowledged . Disguised , of course . Deeply buried . You leave few traces of your true content . Your god , of course , must be Chekhov . ( ALEC stops for a reaction . ANTHONY looks amiable . A long silence . ) ANTHONY ROSE Paddy Chayefsky , actually ALEC If this production accomplishes anything , I hope it will serve that process which must inevitably take place  --  that is , to finally establish you as one of our more serious playwrights . ANTHONY ROSE ( Grins ) Flatterer . ALEC I am not unserious , Mr. Rose . The serious plays in the American oeuvre are , like yours , father-son plays . Virtually everyone from Eugene O'Neill to August Wilson to A. R. Gurney . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY ROSE Death of a Salesman ALEC You 've already thought about this . ANTHONY ROSE I Never Sang For My Father . ALEC Maybe it was no accident  --  p. 29 ANTHONY ROSE no such thing ALEC that your first big success was a father-son play . I have every intention of bringing a new awareness of this piece to the theatrical community . Forgive me if I sound pompous . ANTHONY ROSE I never understimate the power of pomposity . ALEC ( Grins ) Self-effacement also has its advantages . It 's a question of personal style , is n't it ? ( Pause ) ANTHONY ROSE Anita ? ALEC Yes . ANTHONY ROSE Sheumshe 's good ? ALEC She 's solid . She 's intelligent . She takes direction . ANTHONY ROSE you suppose she 's free for dinner ? BLACKOUT p. 30 Act 1 , Scene 4 ACT I : Scene 4 A restaurant . Night . ANTHONY and ANITA are seated at a table . ANITA You 're my first famous person . What 's it like to be famous ? ANTHONY ROSE my plays are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being famous , but less and less since I 'm a single parent . You know , like Meryl Streep , you go to Australia for a shoot , and what happens to the kids ? I mean , I would n't turn it down exactly , but I think I might have an attitude problem . Meryl Streep is n't really at ease with it . I mean , if you do n't want to be recognized on the street or be photographed with your children , go work for Hallmark . No paparazzi is at Hallmark . Are you Jewish ? ANTHONY ROSE why ? ANITA Jewish people are n't as screwed up by fame . Except Woody Allen . Barbra Streisand , maybe . Elliott Gould . Actually , I could be wrong . ( Long pause ) I thought famous people dominated the conversation . ( Pause ) You ever talk about yourself with someone not famous ? I did n't mean that to sound hostile . I 'm just trying to draw you out . I mean , you 're better than famous : you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pause ) You have eyes that do n't listen . My impression , anyhow , is that famous people do n't listen because who 'd listen if they did n't have to ? And when you 've made it  --  I mean , I 'm poor . I have to listen . But I envy you . Particularly now . p. 31 ANTHONY ROSE I  --  do  --  listen . But ANITA ( Very fast ) What ? What ? ANTHONY ROSE It 's two voices . Hard to explain . I hear your voiceAnd this other voice . ANITA You mean like an inner voice ? ANTHONY ROSE someone 's inner voice Does n't seem to be mine ANITA That 's so interesting . ANTHONY ROSE you 're interesting ( Pause ) ANITA You remind me of my father . I 'm gon na get fired for this , but this character , " Sara , " she 's the conduit  --  right ? And so beautiful and strong and this kind of mythical figure . But you seem to know the men so much better . This " Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't act her , but I 'm glad we have this opportunity . What can you tell me about her ? I mean , that will help . ANTHONY ROSE about " Sara " ANITA Yeah . So I can , you know , put some juice in her . I mean , if I can find something in me that 's her , that I can use in her that will help me . With her . p. 32 ANTHONY ROSE something about " Sara " ANITA Like , is she , like , based on someone in your life ? It 's none of my business , but it can really help if you talk a little about her . ANTHONY ROSE I do n't want to interfere ANITA ( Quickly ) With Alec ? Alec has no ego problems in this area . Believe me . Of all the people I 've worked with , Alec does not get threatened . How a baby like that gets to be so secure . So about this " Sara . " ANTHONY ROSE Alec is ( Pause ) ANITA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause ) Can I trust him ? ANITA Alec ? You can trust him with your life !

ANITA His background . ( ANTHONY nods slowly ) His background . His background . What 's his background ? I did know . You have a way about you  --  I do n't know how to describe it , but the way it feels is you 're so shy that I disappear . p. 33 ANTHONY ROSE I 'm sorry ANITA His background . Alec 's background . Chicago ! He 's from one of those suburbs , Oak Ridge , Oak Bluffs , Oak Park  --  His father is a genius like him . A doctor . Rich . Rich ! Like you , rich . ANTHONY ROSE I 'm not rich .

You do n't work for real money . ANITA Good luck ! I work for every penny . ANTHONY ROSE That 's why . ANITA You do n't work for your money ? p. 34 ANTHONY ROSE Very hard . ANITA And you 're rich ! ANTHONY ROSE Because I work If I do n't work , I 'm not rich But if you 're rich-rich and do n't work , you 're still rich . ANITA Yeah ? ANTHONY ROSE I hate my hands ANITA Yeah ? ANTHONY ROSE I notice hands . Always have . No particular reason ANITA ( A little bored ) I do n't pay that much attention to hands . ( Waits . No response . ) Nails . I notice nails . Women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife 's hands are delicate ANITA uh-huh Mine are n't delicate . That 's nice . ANTHONY ROSE I 'm sorry ? ANITA I thought you were starting to come on to me , but you mentioned a wife . ANTHONY ROSE I 've been married for 25 years . ANITA You just do n't expect famous people to do that : mention a wife . p. 35 ANTHONY ROSE may I feel your hand ? ANITA No problem . ( HE takes her hand ) ANTHONY ROSE no . It 's not delicate . I pride myself on how I write my women ANITA I 'm sure it 's me , but I do n't know enough . If I could learn a little more  --  ( Frees her hand ) ANTHONY ROSE what does Alec say ? ANITA He says I came up with better choices if he leaves me alone . I do n't think so . ANTHONY ROSE he 's really smart ? ANITA You watch . ANTHONY ROSE I like youth , young talent . ANITA You go to a lot of these productions ? ANTHONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANITA The same play ? ANTHONY ROSE It 's fun to see how it changes . ANITA The productions are different ? ANTHONY ROSE every director , every cast p. 36 ANITA yeah . ANTHONY ROSE and then the rewrites . ANITA You rewrite ? ANTHONY ROSE Well You 're not comfortable with your part ANITA You 'd rewrite my part for me ? ANTHONY ROSE if it would help ANITA Mr. Rose , I ca n't believe you 're telling me  --  you do n't even kno me  --  you do n't even know I can act ! I can act , but  --  ( Laughs ) I 'm very confused , and I never get confused . ANTHONY ROSE ( Takes out notepad and writes ) that 's a good " Sara " line ( Stares at her ) You 'll make a good " Sara " maybe " Sara " will make a good you . ANITA I do n't think it would hurt if she were , more ballsy . I mean , like her life now revolves around these three guys who are batting her back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ANTHONY ROSE that 's the play . " What does Sara want ? " ANITA No , the play is " Who will Sara pick ? " But is that the same as what she wants ? p. 37 ANTHONY ROSE it 's not ? ANITA Not for my money . ANTHONY ROSE ( Scribbles notes on pad ) Interesting . ( Writes rapidly , turning pages , as ANITA looks on ) ANITA You write so fast . ( Pause ) This is really an honor . ( Pause ) I 'd notice hands , too , if I had hands like yours . What do you mean , you hate them ? It 's like a  --  a force of its own , that hand . ( Long pause ) I can play her young , no problem . But could " Sara " be a little older ? ( ANTHONY continues to write .

I got this offer for a series , Rookie Squad . You know agents  --  or maybe you do n't  --  they made me leave right after New Haven  --  CHESTER Rookie Squad ? I watch everything , but I never heard of that one . NICK Stinkeroo ! Six episodes , and NBC canceled . CHESTER The Madonna of Westport ran four years ! NICK Agents ! Tony stopped speaking to me . I realize in his case that 's hard to tell . CHESTER You ca n't say no to an agent ? NICK You have to be in the business to understand the pressure . You ca n't alienate your agent , and they prefer TV  --  any TV to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( ALEC enters ) p. 39 ALEC Morning , people .

( Goes for her coffee , on a chair next to her tote bag . Crosses to ANITA . ) How was your dinner ? ANITA ( Working out ) Surprising . ( Works out ) I talked too much , as usual . ( Works out ) He 's sort of a sweet guy . ( ANTHONY enters carrying a bulging envelope . ALEC and OTHERS see him and freeze for a moment . ) ALEC Good morning , Mr. Rose . OTHERS Good morning .

( No response ) I loved your last movie , but it 's time you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sits ) People ? ( More ) ( OTHERS cross to table , sit . In the course of ALEC 's speech , it becomes clear that , whether he is looking at him or not , his focus is on ANTHONY ROSE ) p. 40 ALEC ( Cont . ) The American dramatic form is naturalism . The American dramatic subject is family . The English can write about class , the French about culture . We are ignorant of both . Naturalism comes naturally to us because it is the most behaviorist  --  i.e. , the most vulgar of dramatic forms . American innocence , ambition , energy and corruption stem from one source : our vulgarity . The more theater celebrates our vulgarity , the better its chances for success . The more theater disparages or satirizes our vulgarity , the more it alienates its audience . The brilliance of an Anthony Rose , of course , is that almost alone among American playwrights he has had it both ways . The a Parent Lesson passes itself off as froth but it is , in truth , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enjoy . I 'm interested in the jokes in this play . Of course I am . But I 'm more interested in what it has to tell us about ourselves that we really do n't want to hear . NICK Shitwhere does that leave us ? ALEC We do n't play the jokes , folks . The laughs are there , and I promise we will find them . But , first , we find the subtext . ANTHONY ROSE &lt;I have some pages&gt; ( Goes into his envelope and extracts a fat sheet of paper ) p. 41 ALEC ( Astonished ) Pages ? ! ANTHONY ROSE The first " Sara " - " LOU " scene . ( Passes out pages ) &gt; If you open your scripts to I-7 , I 'll go through it with you ALEC You 're revising the scene ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Grins ) you 've inspired me NICK ( Shocked ) New lines ! ANTHONY ROSE ( Grins at NICK ) like old times ( To ALEC ) I hope this is all right ? ALEC ( A forced grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is called for . ANTHONY ROSE ( Reaches out to retain pages ) &gt; then I wo n't ALEC ( Restraining him ) Not at all . ANTHONY ROSE I do n't mean to ALEC Heaven forfend ! I just wish that I knew about this before my little lecture . No matter . ANTHONY ROSE how stupid of me p. 42 ALEC Would you like to share your thoughts on my little essay ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Smiles shyly ) I did n't understand a word of it . ( Smiles ) I 'm not an intellectual ( Smiles ) I do n't think all Americans are vulgar ( Long pause . ALEC stares at the revisions . ) ALEC ( Cold ) I hope there 's time to get all these changes in . NICK ( To CHESTER ) First , they change plays on me ; now they change lines . This is amateur night in Dixie ! ANTHONY ROSE ( Reads from pages ) &gt; From Sara 's line : " You 'll see , " through the next two lines , Sara : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stet . Now everything until the bottom of 1-7 is changed . Sara , would you read I  --  7A , please . ANITA SARA You are the first famous person I ever met . How does it feel ? ( ANITA looks up in recognition ) NICK Lou is famous now ? ANITA SARA I have often wondered what it would be like to be famous . I hate being photographed . I have seen your photograph in many places and  --  p. 43 ANTHONY ROSE ( Interrupts , reading from his script and making changes ) Mke that Vanity Fair and GQ . ANITA Cut " many places " ? ( ANTHONY nods ) ANITA SARA ( Reads ) I have seen your photograph in Vanity Fair and GQ and , however crowded the occasion , you always seem to stand alone . Photographs reveal more to strangers than they have a right to know . As you can see , I have an attitude problem toward fame . ANTHONY ROSE Now we go back to 1  --  7 , bottom of the page , please Lou 's line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " stays in . Sara says : " Not for you . " Lou is stet . ( Reads ) " That , I 'm sure of . " Now , Sara , beginning from : " Because Teddy needs a father  --  " go on from there , please . ANITA SARA This boy  --  this man who has not spoken a word to you in fifteen years  --  NICK ( Interrupts ) Those are my lines . ANTHONY ROSE Not any more . ANITA SARA ( Reads )  --  will be here in five minutes to see you . p. 44 NICK LOU Every approach I made has been rejected . Every letter , telephone call , messages sent through mutual friends  --  That woman has isolated my sons from me as if they were atomic secrets . But now Ted  --  Ted at least agrees to see me . Why ? ANITA SARA Because I asked him to . NICK LOU It 's that easy ? You asked him to . He must be crazy about you . You 're cute . You 're more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shame . ANITA SARA What ? NICK LOU That I 'm at an age where beauty  --  young beauty  --  no longer has an affect on me . Twenty years ago , the sight of a girl like you would fill me with desire . Today , it fills me with nostalgia . And wistfulness . Intense wistfulness . You have no idea how much wistfulness . ANITA SARA Perhaps you are not quite the monster your boys have made you out to be . NICK LOU I am made in their mother 's image . ANITA SARA You have gentle hands . I can tell a lot about people from their appendages . NICK LOU Appendages ? p. 45 ANITA SARA I could tell more about you from your feet . NICK LOU Shall I take off my shoe ? ANITA SARA ( Shakes head ) Please . We 're not at that stage . Anyhow , your hands are quite enough . They show great firmness and strength , and even  --  even  --  I 'm confused  --  NICK LOU What ? ANITA SARA They show good character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NICK LOU That I abandoned my sons fifteen years ago  --  ANITA SARA Yes . NICK LOU There may be another side . ANITA SARA I believe there can only be one side when it comes to children . NICK LOU Ah , then you are not perfect . ANITA SARA Of course not . I never said I was . NICK LOU And that you think there is only one side when it comes to children proves it . There are fifty-seven varieties of sides when it comes to children . There is sweetness and mean-spiritedness , openness and secretiveness , kindness and cruelty  --  extreme cruelty . No group is quite as off-the-top cruel as children . There is love and there is rejection that turns love into a bitter joke that you wish you had never heard . p. 46 ANITA SARA I 'm sorry , but you are not the one who 's been hurt here . NICK LOU Of course not . I 'm the bad guy . There comes a time when even bad guys need to pause in their badness long enough to appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOU Yes ? ANITA SARA I do n't get it at all . You seem sensitive ! CHESTER TED Anybody here ? ANTHONY ROSE that 's all I had time to do ( The ACTORS all look at each other , then at ALEC , who is speechless ) CHESTER I think it 's great stuff . Just great stuff ! NICK This is a different Lou I do n't know , Tony , I think I love it . I love everything you do , but the other Lou  --  You could n't actually like him  --  but I knew how to play him , Tony . I mean , he was a smart , arrogant , funny , funny S.O.B . A real part ! ANITA I think it 's just as funny , but it 's less jokey . It 's less Broadway . It has more sensibility . I think " Sara " is much more real now . NICK I do n't know , Tony . It 's really a whole new It 's as if you 're coming in in the middle of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another play . I mean , maybe it 's a better play , but I was signed to do this play . ( Holds up original script ) Which is a very , very good play . I mean , this play already opened . Twenty-five years ago . It got raves . Frankly , I ca n't get up in lines as fast as I could before I went into TV . We 've got two weeks , Tony ! ( ALL look at ANTHONY , who just smiles . To ALEC ) Alec , ca n't you help us out here ? p. 47 ALEC Of course , I would have liked a chance to have read this material first so please bear with my stammering incoherence . ( Looks about . ALL wait . ) Though sharp and wittily written as always , this revision seems at first blush to soften the conflict between father and sons , which is our primary interest in this play . Or , has that changed ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Shrugs ) I write ' em , I do n't analyze ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisions , albeit perfectly fine revisions  --  no , more than fine . I detect a mellowness . Strike that . Profundity . A depth of personal conviction here that is absent from your early work . But , though moment by moment totally convincing , does this help a work if , in the final analysis , it undermines its through line ? ANITA Can I say something , Alec ? ( ALEC nods ) For the first time , I feel a connectedness to this woman . ( ANTHONY smiles , ALEC frowns ) CHESTER I think to have Anthony Rose rewriting his play for our rehearsals is the single most exciting experience of my life . ( ALEC looks at NICK ) NICK It 's not that I ca n't learn these lines . But I really miss some of the laughs . p. 48 ALEC I ca n't really say I 'm in love with the level of this discussion . Perhaps this is a good time for a break . ( OTHERS look to ANTHONY , do n't move . ALEC rises , stands there waiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exits , clearly preoccupied . ALL follow him off but ALEC , who stares after them , brooding. ) @x Rehearsal room , the next morning . ANITA , NICK , and CHESTER sit at the rehearsal table reading new pages . ANTHONY sits apart from them , then rises and paces as THEY read . The tableau should be reminiscent of a school study hall , the actors as students with their faces hidden behind their pages , ANTHONY as the teacher . Their morning coffees and Danishes sit on the table . ANITA is the first to put her pages down . ANITA Won-der-ful ! CHESTER Wonderful absolutely . Ted 's not quite as sympathetic anymore  --  ANITA But it makes him more real . CHESTER  --  it makes him more real . ANTHONY ROSE I hope so ( Looks at NICK , still reading ) ANITA Can I say something ? ( ANTHONY nods ) It 's so subtle what you do here . The difference in Lou  --  I 'm not even ready to talk about Sara yet  --  but it 's bigger somehow . I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bigger . ANITA It 's the same play , but it 's a new play  --  I do n't know what I 'm talking about . p. 50 CHESTER It 's as if  --  it 's as if  --  ANITA It 's as if the same parts fit together differently  --  ANTHONY ROSE exactly right . ( NICK puts down his pages . ANTHONY looks at him . ) NICK ( Without enthusiasm ) Great stuff . I 'll be damned how you can come up with all these changes in two days . ANTHONY ROSE you ai n't seen nothin ' yet . NICK A lot of work here , my friend . a lot of sweat , blood , toil , and tears . ( Grins at ANTHONY ) I love it . ( ALEC enters . ANTHONY , not noticing , reaches into his tote bag . ) ANTHONY ROSE I have something a gift ALEC Morning , all . ANITA , NICK AND CHESTER ( Overlap ) " Morning . " " Good mornig . " " Hi , Alec . " ( During the greetings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ALEC Anyone have any coffee ? ANITA ( Hands him coffee ) What would you do without me ? p. 51 ALEC Die . ( Drops new pages out of his tote bag ) &gt; Good morning , Mr. Rose . You 've been a busy playwright . ( ANTHONY hands ALEC a ring box ) ANTHONY ROSE Nick , I 'm sorry , yours seems to have been left behind at the hotel . ( OTHERS open their boxes , take out gold rings , study inscription ) CHESTER What a beautiful ring ! ANITA ( Overlap ) There 's an inscription . I need my glasses . ( Reads ) " The Parent Lesson Company " ! How did you get them made up so fast ? ALEC ( Pockets his box in his tote bag without opening it ) Thank you . Quite a few changes . ANTHONY ROSE You got them . I 'm glad . ALEC How did you know where to find me ? ANITA I dropped them off , Alec . ALEC I see when ? ANITA ( Vaguely ) Before . Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Looks about ) Must have been break-of-dawn . ( Pause ) All photocopied and everything . Is n't that convenient ? p. 52 CHESTER Can I ask your opinion on something , Mr. Rose ? ( ANTHONY nods ) Anita says I 'm crazy if I do , but I 'm sorely tempted to just make the jump to New York for a year or two . Or more , depending . I do n't even know toward what end , but I 'm in very good with the Hyatt organization in Kansas City and it 's just possible I could pull a string or two and get myself transferred  --  but the question is  --  ANTHONY ROSE Do n't do it . CHESTER That 's what Anita says . ANTHONY ROSE Anita 's right . CHESTER Well , why not , though ? Why should n't I ? Oh , I know I should n't , but why should n't I ? ANTHONY ROSE As my mother would say , " Do n't ask , you might find out . " ALEC ( To ANTHONY ) You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not much of a sleeper CHESTER If you do n't like your accommodations , I could put you up at the Hyatt . ANITA You got ta have one of my Hot Toddies . Nothing like it . Warm milk , rum , a couple of other magic ingredients  --  a regular witch 's brew . I could sleep around the clock . I even sleep through my kid crying at night . What an awful mother . You have kids ? p. 53 ANTHONY ROSE A son . ANITA How old ? ANTHONY ROSE not nearly old enough ANITA Is he in the business ? ANTHONY ROSE not in any business ANITA I 'm being nosy . ANTHONY ROSE ( Smiles ) No one 's been nosy about me for a long time . I thank you . ANITA Have a croissant . CHESTER You 're Anthony Rose . People must be bothering you all the time . ANTHONY ROSE not really . It 's lonely at the top ( ALL look at him ) kidding NICK ( Going through script ) I seem to be missing page 1-27 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-26 to 1-28 . ( To ANTHONY ) Right ? ( ANTHONY nods . ALEC looks at the two of them curiously . ) ALEC Why do n't we read through the new material , beginning with  --  beginning with  --  ( Thumbs through pages ) p. 54 ANITA Actually , it begins with Lou : " I would have been no good to the two of you when you were little . " ALEC Where exactly will I find that ? ( ANITA crosses to ALEC , going through his pages and finds it for him ) Thank you , Anita . Do the rest of you have it ? Of course you do . Begin , please . NICK LOU I would have been no good to the two of you when you were little . I ca n't do any of the things fathers of boys do . To be a successful American father of boys , you have to be athletic .

CHESTER TED The baseball autographed by Sandy Koufax ? NICK LOU I bought it off a drunk on a flight to Morocco who was showing it off . He had to tell me who Sandy Koufax was . And he was Algerian . I do n't horse around , I 'm not physical , and when you were little I had other women . Your mother has many virtues . Affection for the male sex was not one of them . CHESTER TED You were driven to other women . NICK LOU Your mother 's door was closed . Tight . A man needs a nest . p. 55 CHESTER TED A man needs a father . NICK LOU I would have made a lousy role model . CHESTER TED Are you implying you did us a favor ? NICK LOU I do n't say that was my intention . I say merely that after I left your mother I realized I would be doing no one any good if , out of some distorted sense of responsibility , I forced myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . CHESTER TED I have to sit . ALEC ( Reads ) " Ted collapses on the couch . " NICK LOU A father should offer companionship , give good advice , go on camping trips . Wrong for me . All wrong . But you are older now . CHESTER TED You 've noticed . NICK LOU I 've noticed that you and your brother , after one ruinous relationship after another , are in love with the same woman . CHESTER TED You do n't know this ! How do you know this ? ( Long pause ) You spied on us ! You have no right  --  NICK LOU I did n't want to be cut off . CHESTER TED How could you spy on us ? p. 56 NICK LOU I hired a detective . I knew you would need me some day . I wanted to be well-informed . CHESTER TED I have to lie down . ALEC ( Reads ) " Lies down on couch . " NICK LOU I was concerned . And , yes , I was lonely . While you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . On your school grades . Even , God help me , on your athletic achievements . You won a letter in track . You did the 440 in six minutes . Or is it the 660 in four minutes ? CHESTER TED I have to curl into a fetal position . ALEC ( Reads ) " He curls into a fetal position . " CHESTER TED Where are our drinks ? NICK LOU The reports from my detective were my favorite reading . I read them over and over , committed them to memory . I can tell you the name of every guest at your tenth birthday party . CHESTER TED How could you know that ? NICK LOU My detective was your clown . CHESTER TED I do n't want to hear any more . I hate your guts . NICK LOU I am extremely knowledgeable about women . You and Barry are not . You can easily blow it with this girl . Whom I approve of . She is charming . She is delightful . Not half-saint and half-whore , that aberrant cliche by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . As a father and as a non-father , I do n't want my sons to screw up again . p. 57 CHESTER TED Please shut up ! NICK LOU I 've made my decision . I 'm going to get this girl for one of you . ALEC ( Reads ) " Sara enters . " ANITA SARA Drinks ! CHESTER TED Bathroom ! ALEC ( Reads ) " Ted staggers off in a crouch . " ( Looks up from script ) I think this would be a good place for us to stop . Well , boys and girl , we seem to have something of a born-again Lou arising before us : still witty , still acerbic , but underneath it all  --  ( Cold ) how very , very interesting . Nick , any problems ? NICK I do n't know where the hell I am anymore . ( To ANTHONY ) Will there be a lot more rewrites ? ANTHONY ROSE would cue-cards help , Nick ? ( To ALEC ) Nick might get a bettergraspif we could get it on its feet ALEC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose the old Lou completely . Do you understand ? NICK Too much charm ? p. 58 NICK Hold the charm . Exactly . The charm is in the text . In plentitude . It will make itself known . Keep a little edge , a little of what we know of the old Lou . He lurks beneath the twinkiness of the new Lou . We want something more gutsy than Bill coly . ANTHONY ROSE I do n't want him Hitler ALEC I 'm sure we can find a middle ground between Terrance Rattigan and Hitler . ANTHONY ROSE that would be good ALEC From " I would have been no good  --  " NICK LOU ( Reads ) I would have been no good to the two of you when you were little . ANTHONY ROSE He sounds petulant . ALEC ( Dry ) Are you petulant ? NICK No , I 'm not petulant . Petulant ? Give me a chance to get into it !

ANTHONY ROSE It 's not you I have doubts about . p. 61 ALEC Nick will do fine . ANTHONY ROSE You do n't know what ten years of TV can do to an actor . ALEC You have switched characters on him . ANTHONY ROSE He used to be so good . It 's the same character . ALEC Different character . Same name . ANTHONY ROSE You hate the changes . ALEC I do n't hate them . I 'm disturbed by how you 've altered the balance from errant father and abandoned sons to well-meaning father and mean-spirited sons . ANTHONY ROSE I do n't see them as mean-spirited  --  ALEC The pages we have n't gotten to yet  --  Act I , Scene 3  --  ANTHONY ROSE I 'm sure it 's not perfect . I want us to work together . It 's so hard to find a director who understands what you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming S.O.B ANTHONY ROSE ( Worried ) You do n't think he 's charming ? ALEC Why are you making this man who abandoned his children so likable ? p. 62 ANTHONY ROSE the other wayit seemed like a stacked deck . I want moresubtlety ALEC When you wrote the play you were closer to the boys '  --  Barry and Ted 's  --  ages  --  ANTHONY ROSE Uh-huh . ALEC Now you 're Lou 's age . ( Pause ) ANTHONY ROSE Do n't say anything mean . I do n't think that has anything to do with it . ALEC It 's not Lou you 're identifying with now ? ANTHONY ROSE I thought you were on my side ALEC Mr. Rose , if you 're presenting me with a revised play that relieves bad fathers of their guilt as long as they 're rich and charming enough  --  ANTHONY ROSE ( Cuts in ) That 's not  --  ALEC ( Runs on )  --  then we 're in profound disagreement , and I ca n't direct that play .

Maybe you 've got a problem with this material If I 'm closer to Lou 's age , you are closer to Ted and Barry 's . What 's wrong with a change of heart after 20 years ? p. 63 ALEC You think I identify too strongly with the sons because they are about my age ? ANTHONY ROSE I 'm not analytical ALEC Clearly . ANTHONY ROSE I 'm sure you have no problems with your father . ALEC ( Exasperated ) Mr. Rose ! ( Pause ) Must you ? ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play that I 've directed . ANTHONY ROSE You act ?

" Of course , I only stutter in his presence . ( Pause ) It mortifies me to admit that you 've caught me , Mr. Rose . ( Grins ) I am a jackass ! ( Turns to actors ) People ! Shall we ? ( Actors return downstage ) Rather than go back , why do n't we go on with the scene from Ted 's exit and Sara 's entrance ? p. 64 ANITA ( To ALEC . Reads . ) " How 's it going " ? ALEC Perfecto !

I 've decided not to hold that against him . ANITA SARA Do you mind if I give you some advice ? NICK LOU I welcome it . That 's a lie . No one over 40 wants advice . In your case , it will probably be good advice . That 's the worst kind . It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . ANITA SARA Why not ? NICK LOU You do n't get to be in my position in life by being a good listener . ANITA SARA You wo n't be doing yourself  --  or your sons  --  a favor if you spend your time with them justifying your actions . NICK LOU They deserve an explanation . ANITA SARA Your disappearance from their lives is all the explanation they have ever needed . If you come back only to attack their mother  --  p. 65 NICK LOU Ah , you were eavesdropping . ANITA SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detective to watch his sons ? I would n't dare ! For all these years , they 've known me only by what that woman has told them . There 's another version . ANITA SARA First , they lost their father . Is it your intention now to take away their mother ? ( Pause ) NICK LOU I ca n't tell you how mortifying it is to lose on points to a 28 year old . ALEC ( Reads ) " 23 . " That 's a typo . ANTHONY ROSE 28 . I 've made her older . ALEC Sorry . Go on . NICK LOU I ca n't tell you how mortifying it is to lose on points to a 28 year old ANITA SARA You may be older , but you are less experienced at being a member of a family . NICK LOU Tell me about yourself . ANITA SARA Did n't your detective ? NICK LOU I 'd like confirmation . Your family is from Argentina ? NICK ( Looks up from script ) Argentina ! ( Looks at ANITA and then ANTHONY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Continue , please . ANITA SARA Why should I tell you about myself ? First , you know it already ; second , you wo n't listen . NICK LOU It 's only advice I do n't listen to . ANITA SARA Famous men have eyes that turn inward ; they have eyes that do n't listen . If I were rich I would probably not listen , either . But I 'm not rich . I work . I have a boss . I have to listen . NICK LOU You design book jackets . ANITA SARA I knew you knew . Ted will be back soon . I know you do n't want to hear this , but I 'm going to tell you anyhow . Do n't explain , defend , or justify . Simply talk to him . Listen to him . Ask him questions . But do n't get intrusive . Do n't interrogate . NICK LOU I get it : Talk , but do n't explain ; ask , but do n't intrude . ANITA SARA I can understand why you 're successful at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the words but not the music . NICK LOU Then you 'll have to provide the music . p. 67 CHESTER TED God , do I feel sick ! ANITA SARA He 's coming . I 'll be in the next room . If I hear you get into trouble I 'll signal on the piano . NICK LOU Ah ! The music ! ANITA SARA Make an excuse and come to me . CHESTER TED What are two talking about ? Me , I bet . ANITA SARA Lunch . ALEC ( Reads ) " She exits . " ( Looks up from script ) And so shall we for the moment . Any comments ? ANITA For the first time , this is a character I can relate to  --  and I do n't mean because Anthony has put in some stuff from my own life . ( To ANTHONY ) That part 's great . ( To ALEC ) But you can do that and still get it wrong . But this feels right . ANTHONY ROSE I thank you ANITA I 'm just wondering , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wrong . ALEC Say it , please , Anita . ANITA The way Sara 's developing  --  I do n't know what comes later , but I feel a lot more chemistry between her and Lou than in the original  --  I mean , he 's a lot more attractive now than either of the sons . Am I wrong ? p. 68 NICK I could n't agree more . CHESTER He 's not really as mean anymore . ANITA I kind of want to see her end up with Lou , not Barry . NICK ( Pleased ) Really ? ALEC But it is Barry . That 's the play . ( To ANTHONY ) Or is n't it ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Smiles ) Anita may be on to something ALEC I 'm sorry ? ANTHONY ROSE we 'll have to see . CHESTER You know , not knowing from minute to minute what 's going to happen  --  ( Grins )  --  it 's really getting to be perilous . Like real life . NICK You know , why should n't I end up with Sara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY ROSE ah , Hollywood makes its moves NICK ( To ALEC ) What did I say ? ANTHONY ROSE ca n't get the girl without learning new lines , Nick NICK I do n't have any problem with my lines , Tony . You 've worked with me before . p. 69 ANTHONY ROSE alltoobriefly ( NICK turns to ALEC ) ALEC As I see it , Nick , so much of this scene , of this by-play , is in code . Do you know what I mean ? ( Blank stare from NICK ) Give me a moment . ( Thinks , quotes from memory ) " He 's a fine boy . " What 's he saying ? " He 's a fine boy . " NICK " He 's a fine boyhe looks very much like his mother  --  " ALEC Exactly ! NICK That has to piss him off . ALEC " He 's a fine boy , but he looks very much like his mother  --  " NICK " Why does he have to look like his mother ? " ALEC Exactly . NICK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like  --  " but he looks like that bitch ! "  --  that part I hate . ALEC But ! NICK " But I 've decided not to hold that against him . " ALEC " I forgive him . " NICK " I forgive him . " It 's set up like a gag . p. 70 ALEC You can play that  --  NICK But the subtext  --  ALEC Layers and layers . " he 's a fine boy . " Wistful . All those lost years . " he looks very much like his mother . " Can I really like a boy who looks like his mother ? Then bring it home . Complete the circle . NICK " I 've decided not to hold that against him . " ALEC Virtually every line of Lou 's can have that three-part counterpoint . NICK ( Cheered ) I just have to find it ! ALEC Which you undoubtedly will . ANTHONY ROSE or you can play him as a cop . NICK ( Angry ) Tony  --  ALEC ( To ANTHONY ) If you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY ROSE Nick and I go way back . ( Turns pages in script ) &gt; Nick ( Turns more pages ) &gt; you know where you say ( Reads from script on a performance level ) " No one over 40 wants advice . In your case , it will probably be good advice . That 's the worst kind . It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . " ( Looks to ANITA for her line ) p. 71 ANITA SARA " Why not ? " ANTHONY ROSE ( As LOU ) " You do n't get to be in my position in life by being a good listener . " ( Puts down script ) that 's it , you see . NICK That 's what ? That 's a very nice line reading . That could be the best line reading I 've been given in my whole career . But what are you telling me , Tony ANTHONY ROSE that 's his statementLou 's statementhis credo his wholehis everythingthat he is sums it all up , those few lines " No one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " In your case , it will probably be good advice . " Trying , trying to be nice here . He likes her . He 's drawn to her . " That 's the worst kind . " Good advice is the worst kind . Why , Nick ? Think ! NICK ( Turns to ALEC ) Alec  --  ANTHONY ROSE " It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . " His philosophy . " It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . " He 's been through it a million times . Comes out the same way . Story of his life . A million times . " It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . " Good advice . Think ! " It ca n't be ignored and it ca n't be followed . " ( NICK puts his script down , picks up his jacket , and starts to exit ) Come on , Nick , it 's so easy . ( NICK exits ) BLACKOUT p. 72 Act 2 , Scene 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour later . ANTHONY and ANITA sit at the table , heads close together , deep in conversation . ALEC stands apart , brooding . CHESTER ( Enters ) He checked out . ANTHONY ROSE I 've made a mess of this ALEC He 'll be back . ANTHONY ROSE a mixed blessing ALEC We need a Lou . ANTHONY ROSE the understudy ? ALEC We do n't have understudies . ( Pause . EVERYONE thinks ) ANTHONY ROSE you 're too young to do itI guess . ALEC Me ? I 'm Barry . ANTHONY ROSE you 're Barry ? ALEC You did n't know ? Of course , there 's no reason for you to know . We have n't come to any of Barry 's scenes . ANTHONY ROSE you 're Barry And you will direct ? ALEC I 've done it before . p. 73 ANTHONY ROSE acted and directed ALEC It 's too late to replace both of us , Mr. Rose . Do you have a. problem with me being Barry ? ANTHONY ROSE ( A long pause ) I 'll just have to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine . ANTHONY ROSE does n't fit now ALEC Fucked up , quite crazy , weird , funny I do n't see the problem . ANTHONY ROSE you 'll see ALEC It 's going to be a different Barry . ( ANTHONY shrugs ) Maybe we can get Nick back to play Barry . We wo n't have to pay him off , that way . ANITA He quit ! You 're not gon na have to pay him off . He 's in violation of his contract . ALEC And if he comes back ? ANTHONY ROSE ( Smiles ) Actors hate it when you give them line readings He 's wrong for the part . ANITA You read terrific ! ( ANTHONY smiles shyly ) He did , did n't he , Alec ? p. 74 CHESTER Won-der-ful . ALEC ( Mocking CHESTER ) Won-der-ful . But now we are without a Lou . ( Starts to exit ) I 'll make a couple of calls . Do n't worry , I 'll find somebody . ANTHONY ROSE I 've really made a mess ANITA Why ca n't Anthony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY ) Mr. Rose ? ANITA Who 's gon na be better on such short notice ? His reading was better than anything we got out of Nick . ALEC We need an actor . ANITA You heard him read . You really think you 're going to luck out and find someone better ? ALEC No offense intended , Mr. Rose  --  ANTHONY ROSE none taken . ALEC I have just lost my star . You 're not an actor . I ca n't , in good conscience , offer you the part . ANTHONY ROSE I did stand-up comedy for six yearsI trained with Herbert Berghof . ALEC You would actually consider this ? p. 75 ANITA Alec , this is a cockamamie situation . Anthony is rewriting as we go along , we got two weeks  --  ALEC Perhaps , under the circumstances , we should go back to the original ANTHONY ROSE ( Shakes his head vigorously ) I ca n't bear to see that on stage one more time . ALEC I had in mind a production of your play which you had never seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way I can direct a play that changes from moment to moment  --  ANTHONY ROSE You do n't like the changes . ALEC I am in no position to make a judgment on pages 1 through 28 when there is no way of knowing what to expect on pages 29 through whatever . Is there ? ANTHONY ROSE if you 're afraid of losing the laughs , I still write laughs ALEC I take your work very seriously . ANTHONY ROSE I am never taken seriously . ALEC I take your work too seriously to put on this revision  --  ANTHONY ROSE I always wanted to write a play they take seriously . p. 76 ALEC You will . This is not it . ANTHONY ROSE I ca n't resist the laughs . You think I write too many laughs ? ALEC Only Woody Allen believes that laughs are not serious . The rest of us know better . ANTHONY ROSE Woody got rid of his laughs , and he 's taken seriously . ALEC I 'm sorry this so upsets you . It should n't . ANTHONY ROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simon is taken more seriously than I am . And I 'm much more serious . But nobody knows it because I ca n't stop writing these laughs . These dumb laughs ! ALEC You can write a play with laughs , and still be taken seriously . ANTHONY ROSE You ca n't . It ca n't be done . Look at Waiting for Godot . It 's always been taken seriously . And Steve Martin and Robin Williams did it and put in all these laughs , and everyone was mortified . They could n't even do it with Godot ! I was right to give it all up . You 're right to stop me ALEC ( Pause ) Mr. Rose ANTHONY ROSE I was crazy to start again You 're right . You 're right p. 77 ANITA Alec ! ALEC I have never worked this way before . I am not prepared . There is no way of becoming prepared . ( Pause ) We will stagger through . ( To ANTHONY ) You 're Lou . You 're going to have to rewrite and get up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you can do that ? ANTHONY ROSE Can you play Barry and direct at the same time ? CHESTER ( Giggles ) Touche ! ANTHONY ROSE And I have n't even started on your lines yet . ALEC ( Smiles , apprehensive ) All right , boys and girls . Were Mickey and Judy and we 've rested a ba and we 're putting on a play . ( Crosses to ANITA and takes her upstage , talking inaudibly , gesturing . CHESTER crosses to ANTHONY and stands , watching him thumb through his revision , scribbling changes . Finally , ANTHONY looks up and notices him . ) ANTHONY ROSE People do n't come over to youdo they ? CHESTER I 'm sorry ? ANTHONY ROSE Do you go over to people ? or do people come over to you ? at a party p. 78 CHESTER I do n't know . It depends . Does n't it ? ANTHONY ROSE No . I 'm right People do n't come over to you CHESTER Is that bad ? ANTHONY ROSE For Ted ? It 's good.Ted should n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Defensive ) I like to circulate . I always think I 'm missing something . Why stay in one place ? ( Looks to ANTHONY . Pause . ) Is that bad ? ANTHONY ROSE There are two kinds of people : the people who do n't budge at a party , and you go to them ( Pause ) CHESTER And ? ANTHONY ROSE and what ? CHESTER And the second kind ? ANTHONY ROSE The people who go to them CHESTER I know what kind you are . ANTHONY ROSE not anymore ALEC ( Leaves ANITA ) Shall we ? Let 's take it from : " He 's coming . I 'll be in the next room . p. 79 ANITA SARA He 's coming . I 'll be in the next room . If I hear you get into trouble I 'll signal on the piano . ANTHONY LOU Ah ! The music .

You 've come back into my life after 15 years and made me puke . What gives you the right to spy on me ? To know so much about me ? I do n't know a damn thing about you , and God knows I could have . Your picture 's in the paper , every week with your charity ballsfunding a library for the blind . If the blind were n't so blind , they 'd throw your money back in your face . And now , you want to help my love life ? There 's only one thing wrong with my love life  --  youl What you did to my mother is why I ca n't be with women . What you did to my mother is why I 'm impotent . If you want to help my love life , jump out a window . That 's all the help I need from you , you bastard . ANTHONY LOU Other than that , how 's it going ? CHESTER TED You did n't hear a word I said . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , or justify . I want to listen . So how 's life treating you ? CHESTER TED Drop dead . ALEC ( Reads ) " Piano from the drawing room . " ANTHONY LOU Excuse me . ALEC ( Reads ) " Lou exits , enters the drawing room . " ANITA SARA Oh , the poor boy . ANTHONY LOU The poor boy ? Did I miss something ? ANITA SARA He needs you . ANTHONY LOU You 're telling me he 's just getting this out of his system ? ANITA SARA Yes . ANTHONY LOU You 're telling me to roll with the punches ? ANITA SARA Yes . ANITA Tony , two " Yeses " in a row , it feels kinda-blah . Could I change that to " Right " or " You bet " or something ? ANTHONY ROSE " Yes " will do just fine . ANITA You 're the boss . ANITA SARA Yes . p. 81 ANITA SARA ( cont ) He deserves his say . He 's waited 15 years . ANTHONY LOU He 's not the only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not what I meant . ANITA SARA If you expect me to be sorry for you  --  ANTHONY LOU I expect very little from women . Remember , I was married once . Which one of them do you intend to marry ? ANITA SARA I do n't know what you 're talking about . ANTHONY LOU Do n't you ? Then you 're just like their mother . ANITA SARA I do n't mind you being mean to me if it helps you to be nicer to them . ANTHONY LOU I could never be mean to you . Prickly . I could be prickly . I 'm being prickly at this very moment . Never mean . ANITA SARA Your boys need you . ANTHONY LOU The pity of it is , I need them . Thank you for the musical interlude . ALEC Let 's stop . That was very nice , Anthony . ANITA Is n't he terrific ? p. 82 ALEC Chester , You seem to be holding back on your anger . CHESTER I have a problem with anger . ALEC Ted 's hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to give him his moment . CHESTER The audience is going to hate me . ALEC I wonder why it is that all male actors are afraid of their anger , and all female angers are afraid of their vulnerability . ( To ANTHONY ) I 'm relieved to see Ted 's scene although some what modified is still largely intact . ANTHONY ROSE . actually , I have n't had time to get to it ALEC It 's fine as it is . ANTHONY ROSE I may do something with it ALEC Surely not . ANTHONY ROSE seems a little.over-the-top . I want to work on the tone of it . ALEC You 're not going to soften it ? ( ANTHONY smiles and shrugs ) I think that would be a serious mistake . ( An exchange of stares . To ANITA . ) Anita , You seem to be coming on to Lou a little . Am I wrong ? p. 83 ANITA Really ? I was n't aware of it . ALEC Watch for it . It adds a note we do n't need . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ANITA From them . ALEC Exactly . ANITA God forbid , a woman should come on . ALEC At this point in this play , " God forbid " is the apt phrase . Shall we ? ( Checks script ) " Barry enters , is surprised to find Ted . " ALEC BARRY I thought you were out of town. , CHESTER TED What gave you that idea ? ALEC BARRY You told me . CHESTER TED Change of plans . What are you doing here ? ALEC BARRY I 'm in town . What are you doing here ? CHESTER TED Sara asked me to meet somebody . ALEC BARRY Oh ? Who ? CHESTER TED no one you know . ANTHONY LOU Sorry to be so long . Oh ! ALEC BARRY Oh ? p. 84 CHESTER TED This is Barry . This is my brother , BarryMr . Smith . ( To ALEC BARRY ) This is Mr. Smith . ALEC BARRY How do you do Mr. Smith , is it ? ANTHONY LOU Apparently . Mr. Smith it is . ALEC BARRY From the famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going way back . ALEC BARRY Where 's Sara ? ANTHONY LOU I 'm sure we will hear from her . Musically , if not otherwise . ALEC BARRY Sara asked you over to meet Mr. Smith ? CHESTER TED Mr. Smith is in need of an attorney . ALEC BARRY Someone is always in need of an attorney . I happen to be an editor , Mr. Smith . You do n't need an editor , do you ? ANTHONY LOU If I do , you will be the first to know . ALEC BARRY Thank you . I 'm a man who needs to be needed . In the area of need , I 've been underused . My mother needed my father , but he became unavailable ; and after that , she became unavailable . In the neighborhood , but unavailable . I have spent years by the phone waiting for someone to ring up and tell me I was needed . p. 85 ANTHONY LOU Fathers who hang around can be even more unavailable than fathers who run away . My own father stuck it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've heard of postpartum depression . In my mother 's case , it lasted the length of the marriage . She could never forgive my father for surviving my birth . ALEC BARRY I often wondered what I would do if I should see my father again . ANTHONY LOU That makes two of us . ALEC BARRY Two of us ? ANTHONY LOU Two of you . You and your brother . I 'm sure he wonders , too . You both wonder . And why not ? ALEC BARRY What do you think you would do if you saw your father again after a period of long abandonment  --  or shall we call it " separation " ? Is that a less pejorative word , Mr.um  --  I 'm sorry , I 'm bad at names CHESTER TED Smith . ALEC BARRY Damn ! I will never get that ! ANTHONY LOU I have a friend , successful in his way , lives in Los Angeles , has a son of 20 , a would-be musician . This follows a period of being a would-be film director , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a certain-to-be failure , and the person he blames most for this is my friend , his father , who writes him checks  --  and he is hated for that  --  and sends him to ohe school after another  --  and he is hated for that  --  and pays for a succession of shrinks and gurus  --  and is hated for that , too  --  and pays for abortions , trips to Europe , abortions in Europe  --  and is hated by his son , whom he has never once abandoned , for all of that . So , if I 'm to draw any conclusions about fathers and sons from my friend 's experience , it is this : Fathers exist to be hated  --  ( Looks up from script , clearly improvising ) whether they stick around or not . All my father and I had in common was a love for the Brooklyn Dodgers . I waited , from the age of 13 till into my 40s , when he died , to have a conversation with him that was not about sports . When the Dodgers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANTHONY LOU ( Cont . ) Angeles , my father never spoke of them again . He never spoke to me again . If I tried to introduce another subject  --  Girls . My work . My mother , my future . Anything at all , he got up and left the room . I hated him for that . Until I became a father . Then I understood . Families are n't about fathers . They 're about mothers and children . ( Returns to script ) Being the father in a family is to pay the bills for a house full of Martians , who , in spite of it , treat you like an alien presence . ( Pause , as ALEC collects himself to continue from script ) ALEC BARRY Your friend 's son is obviously neurotic . I would stop hating my father in a minute if he sent me a check . I 'm sorry , I 've forgotten your name . Anthony Lou and Chester Ted Smith . ALEC BARRY I am too old for a father , but I am not too old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time over a father . If I had a father I would take him , I guess  --  I 'm not a bad fellow  --  but I would n't want to take him without a check . ALEC Can we stop ? That was a nice improvisation . Is that staying in or  --  ? ANTHONY ROSE You liked it ? p. 87 ALEC I 'd like it better if you restored Barry 's original speech . The two make a good balance . Very moving . Very informative . ANTHONY ROSE You do n't like Barry 's speech ? ALEC This morning , when I first read this , I had my problems with it , but I wanted to see how it played . I 've got to tell you I much prefer the version you 've cut . ANTHONY ROSE I find that hard to understand . ALEC You 've drained Barry of all his  --  well , sympathy . The rage was there before , but also a sweetness . I do n't know what you intend to do later , but at the moment any chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original  --  ANTHONY ROSE I 'd rather not . ALEC I just want to hear it . I have nothing to say against Lou 's new speech  --  that 's fine work . I urge you to keep the improv . We learn a lot . ANTHONY ROSE Not many laughs ALEC No problem . Let me just read the first Barry speech and see what you think . Maybe there 's a way of incorporating  --  ANTHONY ROSE it does n't work ALEC B-b-b-bear with me . ( Reads script as BARRY ) " I often wondered what I would do if I should see my father again . " ( As LOU ) " No doubt he also wondered . " ( As BARRY ) " What do you think you would do if you saw your father again after a period of long abandonment  --  15 years , to be exact , Mr. Smith ? For 15 years , I 've been going over that scene in my head , and it developed in ways that did n't make me happy , I 've got to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or 7 years , give or take a couple  --  my rage , my sense of innocence and righteousness  --  was pure , Mr. Jones . " " Smith , " Lou says . " I am sorry . But after awhile , into my seventh or eighth or ninth year of rage , something I did n't like began to surface . What surfaced  --  oh , so unwillingly  --  was that it was my fault . That I had driven my father away . I tried to suppress the notion , but it had a mind of its own and would n't go away . Like a teenager 's erection . It was always clear that I was my mother 's favorite . And after Teddy was born  --  Teddy was her baby , but I was her buddy  --  ( More ) p. 88 ALEC ( Cont. ) she would sit me down , put her hand on my thigh  --  right here  --  anchored her hand for an hour at a time and confided in me all that was wrong with her life . And that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her children were perfect , but the man she married was , well  --  the stories were endless and demeaning , and the worse they got , the closer we became . So that by the age of 9 or 10 , my mother 's humiliation had reached such a degrading low that she and I were practically engaged . And as I listened , I grew years beyond my real age . In my mind 's eye , I became my mother 's protector , her knight in shining armor who would save her by mounting my white steed , Trigger  --  I was not very imaginative when it came to white steeds  --  and I would sally forth to slay the evil dragon  --  namely , my father , Mr. Black . I spent months , probably years , dreaming of how I would get rid of him for her  --  and one morning I went to his bedroom , which seemed empty even when he was in it , and it was really empty : He was gone . I did n't remember this till years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleven-years old , and I 've saved my mother ! But the result was not what I expected . She did n't take me into her arms and bless me with a thousand moist kisses . She never touched me again , actually . Teddy or me . She curled up inside herself and disappeared , and that 's when I must have known  --  although it did n't become clear to me till years later  --  that I was not her prince , I was her hit man . I was a criminal . I had slain my father and turned my mother into a stuffed doll . " ( Looks up from script ) That speech is an important speech , Mr. Rose . It 's a serious , and I would say artful , speech . It 's the reason I wanted to do this play . You ca n't cut it . p. 89 ANTHONY ROSE We cut a lot of it for Broadway . I let it go in the published edition because I liked it , too , at the time . Unfortunately , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have played as directed . Let me do it . ANTHONY ROSE ( Pause ) It does n't work . ALEC I can make it work . ANTHONY ROSE It does n't fit anymore . ALEC This is a far more interesting B-B-Barry than the one you 're writing now . ( Corrects his stammer ) Barry . ANTHONY ROSE More sentimental , you mean . ALEC More honest . ANTHONY ROSE No . I 'm sorry to say , it 's more honest to say he wants his old man 's money . ALEC That 's wrong . ANTHONY ROSE You 're still very young . I can understand . ALEC I believe this has more to do with truth than with age . ANTHONY ROSE Some day you 'll learn that truth is a matter of who writes the material . The speech is cut . ALEC I ca n't agree with that . p. 90 ANTHONY ROSE It 's my play . ALEC It 's my production . I wo n't do it without that speech . ANTHONY ROSE Listen to me , you little fag  --  this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is dumb . I think this is all terrific stuff . CHESTER Me , too . ANITA You 're both too worked up at the moment  --  ANTHONY ROSE I 'm not . ANITA OK , you 're not . And Alec 's not . Everyone 's cool . Anthony , I think some of the stuff you 're writing now , this new stuff , is terrific . Really terrific . But you do n't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater . ANTHONY ROSE The business with the check has to be in . ANITA So put them both in . ALEC Barry can not make that speech and then say all he wants from his father is a check ! ANITA OK , OK . Is everyone calm ? So Ted says it . ALEC Ted says it ? ANITA Barry says what he says  --  which I love , it 's very moving  --  p. 91 ANTHONY ROSE You do n't really think so . ANITA Sweetie , not everything you wrote 20 years ago sucks . Your improv blew me away ! so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Checks script ) Barry says , " Your friend 's son is obviously neurotic . " And Ted says , Ted says , " I would stop hating my father in a minute if he sent me a check . And so on  --  the rest of it . CHESTER But it 's so mean . ANITA Children do say these things when they 're hurt . Ted 's been hurt . My kid says awful things to me all the time : " I wish you were dead . " " You go to work and you do n't care who takes care of me . " This is what kids say . Chester , you can say it . ANTHONY ROSE Give those lines to Ted ? ( To ALEC ) Do you think that would work ? ALEC I 'm a little lost . Where does Barry 's speech come in ? ( ANTHONY looks to ANITA , who rummages through script ) ANITA ( To ANTHONY ) You 're going to be very happy you saved this speech . Here ! Here 's where it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not a bad fellow  --  but I would n't want to take him without a check . " Then Barry says  --  ( Takes page from ALEC ) &gt; " What do you think you would do if you saw your father again ? " And so on and so on into that great speech . p. 92 ANTHONY ROSE So , first , it 's between Lou and Ted . ANITA Right . Right . ANTHONY ROSE And where does Barry come in ? ANITA ( With pages ) &gt; Right here , sweetie . You see ? What 's the problem ANTHONY ROSE I do n't see any problem . ANITA I told you there was no problem . ( To ALEC ) All right , Alec ? ( No response ) ANTHONY ROSE ( Goes through the pages . To ANITA. ) &gt; Where have you been all my life ? ( To ALEC ) I 'm a pest . Forgive me . I know what you must think of me . I would like to go on . I liked your Barry . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes I get an idea in my head . This could be wonderful . ( To ANITA ) Could n't it ? ANITA Won-der-ful . CHESTER I do n't want to come out mean . ANITA Chesterrr ! CHESTER I 'll do it if you think it works , Anita , but I really hope I do n't come out the mean one . p. 93 ANITA We 've got ten days , guys . We 're gon na rehearse this brilliant , wonderful , very funny and very , very serious play , and we are going to surprise everybody , including ourselves , and make this work . Alec ? ( Pause ) ALEC ( Numb ) Yes , why do n't  --  why do n't we go on  --  Anita , since you have such a firm grasp on this , why do n't you take the rehearsal ? I 'm going to get a drink of water ANITA The Sara-Lou seduction scene ? ALEC ( Not listening ) Fine . ( Exits ) ( ANITA and ANTHONY read from scripts ) ANTHONY LOU I should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should have sent your detective . This is no time to waver . ANTHONY LOU You 're right . An hour ago was the time to waver . I should never have come . This is a mistake . Do n't blame yourself . ANITA SARA I do n't . ANTHONY LOU Good Lord , you do n't even pause before not blaming yourself . What I would n't give to not blame myself as quickly as you do n't . You are able to not blame yourself without thinking whether or not there 's any reason to blame yourself . Is it arrogance ? Smugness ? Youth ? p. 94 ANITA SARA Innocence ? ANTHONY LOU I had n't thought of that one . You are innocent , are n't you ? And yet you 're innocent with a dark side . You 're not a nun . It 's not a virginal innocence . It 's an innocence that knows how to fool around . ANITA SARA You certainly know how to make innocence look bad . ANTHONY LOU I 'm on to your game , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOU It 's a game women know well . Pick two inadequate men of dubious sexual identity , play one against the other  --  ANITA SARA I do n't ! ANTHONY LOU Act as if you cared . ANITA SARA I do care ! ANTHONY LOU But when one draws close , move over to the other . Keep them on a string . ANITA SARA You do a very funny thing . ANTHONY LOU Do I ? ANITA SARA But it 's not so funny . ANTHONY LOU What funny thing ? ANITA SARA You take what 's best in me . You take what 's inside me that I know to be good and you make it sound scheming and deceitful . p. 95 ANTHONY LOU There 's no truth in what I said ? ANITA SARA There was no truth in what you said before you said it . But now you 've planted the idea in my head , and I  --  ANTHONY LOU You 're not sure now . ANITA SARA I 'm not sure . ANTHONY LOU You suspect your own motives . ANITA SARA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do now ? ANTHONY LOU I think I can help you . ( Kisses her ) ANITA SARA This is wrong . ANTHONY LOU No , this is the beginning of what 's right . ( Kiss . ALEC enters on kiss . Stares . Starts to speak while they are still in mid-kiss . ) ALEC I grew up believing that writers  --  not all writers , good writers  --  the writers I admired had something to teach the rest of us . That they-they-they were morally.attuned . A thing of the heart and/or the brain made them morally superior . I attended an international writers congress in New York a few years back . Writers from all over the world convened over such weighty matters as censorship , morality , racism , sexism  --  and they gave papers and debated , and their sensitivity and superiority as human beings was certified in every corner of every corridor during every minute of this congress . And who donated great goblets of money and free hotel space so that this morally-fraighted gathering could take place ? of the most notorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Eastern Seaboard . And not a single one of the moral presences present took notice . I still adore the written word ; I just ca n't stand who writes it . p. 96 ANTHONY ROSE I have n't had much support in recent years . In just the last couple of days , you 've become my family . Forgive me . I should n't be  --  This is difficult to say . I 've been on the road too long . Maybe Kansas City is where I should settle . Break in my plays here . I thought Minneapolis would do for a while , but after the honeymoon period , they were as bad as Broadway . The concept of loyalty . I 've always been so loyal . No good deed goes unpunished , does it ? Ten cities I 've been to just this year alone , and  --  you do so much , put out so much  --  and they 're just not loyal . Barry 's speech  --  it 's Ted 's now  --  about only wanting money from his father . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I write  --  I disguise it , of course  --  protect the guilty  --  it 's almost word-for-word true . Word for word . I could n't make it up . I do n't have that kind of imagination . What they 've done . My wife  --  So loyal in the beginning , but it 's the same always . And all I could do to survive was make jokes . You do n't know what I 've done to try to get rid of them . But there 's something behind the jokes . And you understand . I thought they understood in Lenox . I 'm so trusting every time . St. Louis . A wonderful little theater in Rockford , Illinois . Unspoiled , I thought.They 're all the same . They want to go back to the original . I 'm writing the best work of my life . Regional theaters are n't like Broadway ? That 's a laugh ! All of them , they want to go back to the original . They want to keep me what I was . I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he was born I warned her how he 'd turn out . If she kept it up . She never was able to admit . I was right . Mr. Moneybags right ? I was out of the picture . From the day he was born to this ! Did he ever even try ? Never , more than two or three days on a job , and then what else but run home to the old man  --  gim me , gim me , and there 's no thanks . Thanks ? Are you serious ? The language she uses . On him ? Are you kidding ? On me ! Never her angelic son ! " I ca n't stand your silence " She says . " Pretend this is a play " . She refuses to take me seriously . So is it any wonder I left ? Now she takes me seriously . I left , my father stayed . I suppose it does n't make any difference . I 'm not comparing you to them . Your reasons are artistic . You 're not disloyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ? Who cares ? Do n't confuse me with your father ! IF that 's really now what he 's mad at . Not me . Thank God . Thank God Now I 've found this family . This is all the family I need . I 'm so lucky . I 've always been kind of lucky . ( Afer a pause , ANITA and CHESTER turn to ALEC , who picks up script ) p. 97 ALEC All right , b-b-boys and girls . We 're M-Mickey and Judy , and we 've rented a barn and we 're p-p-putting on a p-p-p-p-p-p-play . Shall we ? p. 98 Act 2 , Scene 3 ACT II : Scene 3 ( Three years later . Los Angeles . NICK 's lavish office , tastefully Hollywood . Lights up on NICK , spotted in a leather armchair , sipping a diet soda and addressing unseen guests in the surrounding darkness . He is expensively but casually dressed . His dress and manner leave no question that he is a star . ) NICK Would I rather be doing Broadway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rape ? Your script here  --  you write a script on battered women , do you bring it to Broadway ? Broadway wants fluff . Broadway wants Andrew Lloyd Whatever . What Broadway does not  --  repeat , does not  --  want is to address the meaningful issues of the day . Film 's no different . Film is a disgrace . Film is cut to the chase . So I have no apologies . Television , not withstanding the compromises , is the last meaningful medium . Why ? Because it has no value system outside the numbers . Our show gets a steady 31 share , so we can say anything we want , because we have proved that ideas can work in the marketplace . Cancer , Romelessness , whatever  --  Prove it in the marketplace , and free expression is your domain . Television is what Poland and China and East Germany are all about . The free expression of controversial ideas . What 's our secret ? Alec can tell you better than me . When we were floundering in the middle of our first season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced the concept of issue  --  oriented violence and the rest is history Twelve Emmys in the last two years . ( Lights up on the rest of the office , revealing ANTHONY and ANITA seated on a leather couch across from Nick . ANITA has undergone Hollywood transformation , is dressed sexily in a tight blouse , Jeans , bracelets , and boots . ANTHONY has aged perceptively and not well . He is dressed as before. ) p. 99 NICK ( continued ) There 's not an East Coast writer not dying to work for us . So am I surprised you 're here ? No . Am I surprised by your script ? Very . It 's got ta be a real reach for you . I 'm amazed at how close you 've come , your first shot . What am I saying ? You 're you , right ? ( Stares at ANTHONY . No response . ) ANITA Right . Antonio and I watched from the pilot on . We 're hooked . And we both thought when it came to making a statement on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice is there ? NICK ( Waves the script ) I 'll tell you the real surprise . For me . No laughs . Not a single laugh . Are you aware of that , Tony ? Sure you are . I 'll tell you something . Alec gave me the script with the title page missing . I was impressed . More than impressed . Then he says to me , " guess who wrote it ? " In a million years I could n't guess . I 'm flattered by this submission . You know the show . ANITA It 's a breakthrough show , Nick . Both of us say that . NICK Do n't say it too loud , you do n't want the network to hear . All they know is the violence and the stunts  --  ANITA That 's the easy part . NICK It 's not that easy if you do your own stunts . p. 100 ANITA You know what I mean . NICK There 's too much glib criticism of violence on TV . We live in violent times . Without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " violence is our frame , character is our color . " ( An uneasy pause . ) He sends regards . ANITA He 's not coming ? NICK He never comes to writer meetings . He directs , I produce . ANITA Antonio would value his opinion . NICK I speak for the two of us . We 've discussed this and we 're in agreement . The script can be made to work . Neither of us could believe how close this comes , with the total absense of humor . If you know the show , you know we have no problem with humor . Of course , with " battered women " , you do n't expect funny but still , Anthony Rose . Anthony Rose is funny . Would this be some sort of breakthrough ? ANITA You did n't see our Movie of the Week ? NICK I heard only good things . ANITA It was the first piece he wrote after getting out . It was n't funny either . We pulled a good share . Not in your league but we 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've already been not funny ? Still , I 'm impressed . p. 101 ANITA I playes this pathetic homeless woman  --  NICK ( interrupts ) Did you see our homeless episode ? A lived on the streets for a week . That 's where you get the resonance . We like to shoot for resonance . The authenticity . You ca n't fake the authenticity . Not that I think we 're being courageous here . ANITA Who else says these things ? NICK These issues have to be addressed . ANITA The smartest thing you did in my opinion was killing off the young cop . NICK God bless you , Anita , for saying that . The fights we had with the hierarchy ! Who made it a law , there 's always got to be a young lead with the old lead ? It 's like it 's violating one of the Commandments . But the kid was never much good . ANITA He reminded me a little of Chester . NICK ( Does n't understand ) Chester ? I 'm sorry . ANITA From Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not my show . ( Pause ) One of the sons ? ANITA He swore he 'd never go near the stage again . Actually he ended up with a very solid performance . p. 102 NICK ( Grins ) Before the shit hit the fan . ( Uneasy pause ) It made the papers even out here . ANITA The last night , ask Alec , by then we were all a little crazy . It was kind of an improv moment . Ask Alec , it was never all that meaningful . Anyhow , Antonio 's in great shape now . Writes ten hours a day . And you should see him with our kid . Father of the Year . NICK Alec says you used live ammo , the shot you took at him . He says he never knew what the fuck was coming next . Tony was giving him new lines between scenes . ANITA Whatever . He 's fine now . NICK I 'd rather be shot at than get new lines between scenes . Hey , I 'm grateful ! It drove him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd be today . ( ALEC enters , dressed in West Coast casaal ) ALEC Unemployed . ( Grins tightly ) Boys and girl . ( ANITA leaps up to hug him , thinks better of it and stands there . ANTHONY rises slowly , a beat later . ALEC shakes hands , almost formally . ) ANITA You look great ! You lost weight ! ALEC I 've got a trainer . p. 103 ANITA Alec , a trainer ! Not you ! ALEC My very own trainer . NICK Two years ago he 's a nobody , and now he has his own trainer . ALEC America . ANITA I 'm sorry about your mother . ALEC My father . ANITA I 'm sorry . ALEC ( Shrugs ) We had n't spoken in years . You 've made quite a dent out here . ANITA Rita Moreno Junior . ALEC Nonetheless . ANITA Even the hookers think I 'm a hooker . It 's work . It 's terrific . My kids love it out here . They 're on their way to becoming blonde . ANTHONY ROSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still be funny . ALEC Why does he want to write for TV ? ANITA He wants to write for you , Alec . ( ALEC shakes his head doubtfully ) He wants to make it up to you . ( Pause ) He has more respect for you than anyone else out here . p. 104 ALEC He took a shot at me , Anita . ANITA He feels very sorry for that . ALEC I do n't remember getting a letter of apology . ANITA Alec , he 's been in and out of the funny farm for two years . We 're here . Is n't it enough ? If you think it 's easy , writing a show on spec to please you  --  and you do n't show up for the meeting  --  ALEC I showed up . ANITA Late . I have no problem with that . It 's tough all around . But if you stop working with everyone you have a fight with , there are n't that many good people in the business for us to afford to do that . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fences . He did it with his son . He made him P.A. on our Movie of the Week . He even did it with his ex-wife . It should be harder for them than for you . ALEC ( Thoughtful ) Is he willing to make changes ? ( ANITA nods with great seriousness ) ( To ANTHONY : ) I respect this effort . ( indicates script ) Perhaps the best way to begin is to describe what we try , in our blundering way , to do with STREET SOLDIERS . You may think you already know this , but  --  ( Shrugs )  --  STREET SOLDIERS is set in the reasonably near future , at that time when much of L.A. is a ghetto . Major Chips Mendez , Nick here , is a career soldier , half Anglo , half Mexican , torn between the two cultures , in a sense , America in microcosm . He commands a National Guard unit occupying East L.A. All sides hate him . On the streets he 's considered a sell-out ; in the military , he 's considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , qua psychoanalyst , qua fighting force . He is an idealist who sounds like a cynic , a macho-man with a heart of mush , a professional killer who grieves for his victims , Rambo with the dimensions of Hemingway . None of this is said outright , of course . It 's said with action , attitude , behavior . You 've written two or three-page monologues here . Fine for the stage . False for TV . The one rule to remember in writing scripts for us : whoever talks lies or covers up . Talk is manipulative . Action is truth . Mendez is honest , therefore , no words . We learn his truths from his close-ups . Or his violence . His dialogue must be cut to the bone . In any case , yours , with all due respect , is outrageously sentimental . And too profane . We do not say " fuck " on TV . We say " freaking " . We do not say " bastard " or " son of a bitch " or " mother-fucker . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slime-bucket " . The limits of craft here are severe , quite severe , which is why you have to be a very good writer , a very special kind of writer , to stake out creative ground within those limits . And you can not be sensitive to cuts and editing . Editing is our process . I 'm not at all sure that this is for you . ( ANITA looks at ANTHONY ) p. 105 ANITA ( to ALEC ) No problem . He can do it . NICK ( to ALEC ) The child-abuse show . ALEC ( Thinks , nods ) We 've been discussing a child-abuse episode , treating the barrio , of course , but treating Bel Air as well . I 'm going to trust you with this material although it strikes a particularly personal chord . The father in this episode will be a surgeon , much like my own father . Not that my father ever struck me ; he abused me with his diffidence . And indifference . And contempt . Mendez takes under his wing an upper-class runaway whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've much reflected on the fact that while my father was alive , my life was in art . Did n't make a dime . Six months after he died , I went into television . ( Pause ) In any case , we work with our writers by outline . We 'll give you the story line , characters , descriptions , etcetera . We 're flexible . Within that , you 'll find you have more room to maneuver than you think . NICK And what the hell , there 's no law that says in the right places , you ca n't be funny . ANITA ( Shakes her head )
