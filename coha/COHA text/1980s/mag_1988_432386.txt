 | Nature is ruthless . An unattended house will eventually rot and collapse ; a car that is not cared for will rust and decay ; even elegant statuary and magnificent cathedrals are etched , worn smooth , and compromised by the effects of weathering . The same holds true for the deck in your backyard . Unless you are unusually diligent , there will come a time when the effects of mold , mildew , and ultraviolet radiation will make your deck look worse for wear , and your elegant addition will become a weatherbeaten blemish . Until a few years ago there was not much you could do to keep your deck fresh looking , short of sanding it down or drenching it with a chlorine bleach or acid solution . Trouble was , sanding took a tremendous amount of effort ? and often required resettin : nailheads . Acids and bleach are toxic materials . They also give a deck a washed-out look . Enter wood renewers . Wood renewers made especially for  | decks started surfacing four or five years ago . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mold and clean off gray tarnish to reveal fresh-looking wood without using acids or chlorine bleach . Of the halfdozen wood-renewing products now on the market , four are powders that are mixed with water ; one is a concentrated solution that is diluted before use ; and one is a liquid that 's used full strength . I spoke with several experts in the field to find out how and why wood weathers , how exactly the restorers work , what they are made of , what differences there are between them , and what you can do to keep your deck looking good once you have cleaned it . Protecting your investment " You 've spent $3,000 to $5,000 on a deck , " says Richard Tripodi , vice president of marketing for Darworth Co. , " and now , three or fours years later , it looks weather-beaten and is fast becoming an eyesore . What do you do ? " That was a major concern homeowners expressed to Darworth , manufacturer of Cuprinol wood preservatives and stains , in a consumer survey taken a few years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard about maintenance before , " Tripodi says . Everyone was so hung up on new deck building that nobody was paying attention to what you do , say , three years down the road . " What precisely happens to wood exposed to the elements ? According to Alan Ross , who holds a Ph.D . in organic chemistry and is technical director of protection products for Koppers Co. , manufacturer of Wolman Deck Brightener , three things affect decks : Dirt settles on , gets ground into , and gets spilled on the wood ; mildew and other organisms grow on the wood 's surface , darkening it ; and ultraviolet radiation breaks down the surface cellulose cells , making them go gray . Any product that is going to rejuvenate weathered wood effectively must attack these three problem areas . " Historically , the most common substance used to clean wood has been a sodium hypochlorite or calcium hypochlorite material like household bleach , " Ross says . " Those materials will remove mildew , but they leave behind degraded cellulose cells and give the wood a washed-out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Another common material is oxalic acid , which is particularly good at dissolving tannin resins . It 's effective on redwood , which is notorious for tannin secretion , " Ross continues . " Oxalic acid does not really do anything for mildew or dirt . What it does remove are dark tannin stains . " One of the first of the wood restorers was Dekswood , a concentrated liquid from The Flood Co. that is based on a solution of detergents and 10 percent oxalic acid . I tried it on a small area of weathered redwood , spraying it on , rubbing it in with a stiff brush , then rinsing it off . It cleaned the redwood well . A newer product , also a liquid , is Macklanburg-Duncan 's Weather Warrior , a solution based on the chlorine bleach sodium hypochlorite and cupric hydroxide , an acid . I was not able to use Weather Warrior , but some of its label warnings include " May discolor clothing , " " Avoid contact with plants , " and " Wear gloves . " @# The newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are the four powders , Wolman Deck Brightener , Cuprinol Revive Deck Cleaner , Zar Wood Brightener , and Osmose Wood Brite . They are all based on the active ingredient sodium percarbonate . ( You 'll see other names on the labels , like disodium peroxydicarbonate , percarbonate of soda , and sodium carbonate peroxyhydrate . According to Ross , they are different chemical names for the same substance . ) " Sodium percarbonate is used in some denture cleaners , and is similar to what detergent people call nonchlorine bleach , or oxygen bleach , " Ross says . " It relies on oxygen rather than chlorine to do the cleaning , and is not as caustic or reactive with colored materials like fabrics ? or wood pigment . " In fact , the difference between a sodium percarbonate-based cleaner and a sodium hypochlorite-based one can be likened to the difference between an all-fabric bleach and a chlorine bleach : One enhances color while the other bleaches color out . " After the powder is mixed and sprayed or mopped onto the deck , " Ross tells me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two chemicals , hydrogen peroxide and sodium carbonate . The hydrogen peroxide softens and helps remove the upper gray cell layers of the wood ; sodium carbonate , which is perhaps better known as soda ash and is found in baking powder , baking soda , and soaps , acts as a cleaner . After you let the solution stand on the wood for about 10 minutes , you go over the deck with a stiff-bristle broom , then rinse it off with water . The effect is not unlike what you 'd get if you were to plane the wood to get an extremely fine veneer off its surface . " Although the powders all contain some form of sodium carbonate , there are subtle differences among them , primarily in some of their cleaning agents . For example , John Molski , United Gilsonite Laboratories ' technical director , told me Zar Wood Brightener uses sodium metasilicate and sodium perborate , along with sodium sesquicarbonate , as cleaners . " We did about two years of testing , using exposure panels as well as actual weathered decks , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe use . " Keeping up appearances Now that you 've cleaned your deck , how do you keep it looking good ? " Depending on the effect you want , " Darworth 's Tripodi says , " you can use a semi-transparent stain and wood preservative or a clear wood sealer . A stained finish will give you just about any color you want . A solid stain is not recommended , however , because you wo n't see much of the wood 's grain and the finish will wear noticeably in high-traffic areas . A semi-transparent stain will enhance the grain effect , and the finish will probably last for two or three years . A clear sealer will not last as long as a stained finish . It should be reapplied annually . A waterbased clear sealer is easy to apply : You can just spray it on with a garden sprayer . " No matter what you do , you wo n't completely eliminate the ravages of time . But with a little care and the right equipment , you can soften its blow and keep your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
