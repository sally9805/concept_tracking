When the furious energy that has fueled an artistic movement dissipates , what is left ? When the youthful goals of discomfiting elders and shocking the bourgeoisie have been achieved , what remains to be accomplished ? Can an erstwhile avant-garde development settle comfortably into maturity and still avoid middle-age spread ? <P> Twenty years or so after the rise of minimalism , and almost a decade after Composer Philip Glass and Theater Artist Robert Wilson detonated Einstein on the Beach at the Metropolitan Opera House , the answers are appearing . Last week in Cambridge , Mass. , the American Repertory Theater ( ART ) offered the world premiere of The Juniper Tree , a collaborative opera by Glass and Composer Robert Moran , in a staging by Director Andrei Serban . The event demonstrated how pervasive minimalism 's influence has become , and what promise it still holds . <P> Glass and Wilson began as cultural rebels , " downtown " artists in New York City 's bohemian SoHo district who shared a radical aesthetic . Linked not only by ideals but by the cultural establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like-minded colleagues forged a style that prized content over form , emotion over intellectuality ; gradually , they won over wider audiences with the uncompromising excellence of their visions . Today Glass 's relentless , repetitious music has become gentler , smoother , subtler and more flexible . Wilson 's stream-of-consciousness stage pictures , which are intended to evoke emotional states rather than further conventional narrative , are beginning to creep into common director 's parlance . <P> Based on an especially grisly Brothers Grimm fairy tale , the Juniper Tree libretto , by Children 's Author Arthur Yorinks , recounts the fable of an evil stepmother ( Mezzo Ruby Hinds ) who murders her stepson ( Soprano Lynn Torgove ) and serves the dismembered boy to his father ( Baritone Sanford Sylvan ) in a stew . His spirit reincarnated as a bird , the boy takes his revenge by dropping a millstone on the stepmother and is joyfully restored to his father and half sister . Watching over all is the juniper tree , in which dwells the benign spirit of the boy 's real mother . <P> Wisely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's elements of love and redemption , instead of its gruesome aspects . Glass 's familiar style is aptly suited to express transfigured states like the fatal ecstasy of the first wife , who dies giving birth to her beloved son , while Moran 's more muscular music communicates the horror of the murder without wallowing in it , the way the detached , matterof-fact language of a fable does . <P> In dividing the opera 's six scenes roughly equally between them , the composers have maintained stylistic integrity even while sharing melodic motifs and a unified dramatic plan . The interplay between them is slickly accomplished , especially in the final scene , when Moran picks up Glass 's folk- style setting of the bird 's lament and brings the opera to a peaceful close . Musical collaborations historically have not been very successful , but Glass 's hypnotic arpeggios and Moran 's dry Stravinskian syncopations are harmoniously soldered in a chamber opera that should prove practical and durable . The Juniper Tree represents the triumph of experience over youth .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
