He reports he performed the movie 's swan dives and jackknives in " all but a fraction of a shot . " His secret : " a lot of hard work , " including a daily five-mile walk and a 20-to-25-minute aerobics workout most mornings . For 35 years he has limited himself to a one-meal-a-day diet . Ameche would rather spend more time with his six children , eleven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren than make another movie . But he has no intention of slowing down .

At first glance , Sally Field , 38 , seemed to be mining the same emotional vein in Murphy 's Romance , the new movie she made in Arizona with James Garner .

" This is not like that at all , " contends Ritt . " It 's a grownup comedy . " Adds Field : " It 's about learning to choose to be in a healthy relationship in your life . Breaking the pattern of always picking to lose . Picking to win . " Anyone who remembers her " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised by that sentiment . <P> Question : Who is the first batter in the major leagues to be the 4,000th strikeout victim of a pitcher ? Answer : New York Met Danny Heep . After two fast-balls and a curve that fooled him badly , Mr. Heep became the latest answer to a trivia question on the occasion last week of Nolan Ryan 's unmatched milestone . A crowd of more than 20,000 , including Baseball Commissioner Peter Ueberroth , gave the Houston Astros pitcher a two-minute standing ovation when he reached four grand . Ryan , 38 , chalked up four more batters before leaving the game in the seventh inning . ( The Astros won 4-3 . ) That 4,004 K mark is 96 ahead of his nearest rival , Philadelphia 's Steve Carlton , currently sidelined by an injury .
