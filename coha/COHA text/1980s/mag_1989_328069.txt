In early 1981 , National Security Agency officials working at an intelligence facility in suburban Washington made an alarming discovery : someone had made off with a sizable haul of classified information . The thief did not jimmy open a window at the well-guarded site ; instead , he gained access to a " secure " cable leading into the facility and was able to trespass electronically . NSA officials believed the breach was the work of an East bloc spy agency . <P> If so , it was not the only one . A previously undisclosed series of high-tech espionage coups have been achieved by both sides . " Foreign intelligence services have gained access to classified information in U.S. computers by remote means , " a former senior Government computer expert told TIME . " And we have done the same thing to them . " <P> Last week the U.S. arrested and then expelled a Soviet military attache for allegedly trying to steal details of computer-security programs . The incident , as well as the arrest earlier this month of three West German computer hackers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent to which rival intelligence agencies are scrambling to devise ways to penetrate one another 's security systems . <P> A number of current or former officials say U.S. intelligence agencies have had considerable success in penetrating classified military computer systems in the Soviet Union and other countries . The rule , explains one expert , is that " any country whose sensitive communications we can read , we can get into their computers . " Breaches of some Soviet computers were done not by cracking codes but by physically breaking into Soviet military facilities , sources said . <P> Both the NSA and CIA have also " experimented " with the disruption of other nations ' computers by infecting them with viruses and other destructive programs , according to some sources . But there is said to be concern in the intelligence community that these disruption operations could go too far and lead to retaliation . <P> The military 's growing reliance on linked computer networks for battle management and command and control increases the danger of catastrophic sabotage by a hostile insider . That 's why some U.S. security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P>  --  An enemy agent in the Pentagon sends a computer virus through the World- Wide Military Command and Control System , which U.S. commanders would rely on in wartime for information and coordination . The virus sits undetected . When hostilities begin , the agent sends a message that triggers the virus , erasing everything in the system . <P>  --  A different virus is introduced into NATO 's logistics computers . Triggered just as the Soviet army marches into West Germany , the virus alters messages so that all allied supplies are sent to the wrong places . By the time the mistake is corrected a day or two later , key parts of NATO 's defense line have collapsed .
