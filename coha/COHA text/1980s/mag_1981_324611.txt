Rebuilding the stockpile <P> For all its vast natural wealth , the U.S. is dangerously dependent on foreign suppliers for a number of imports vital for defense production or high-technology equipment . President Reagan warned last month that " it is now widely recognized that our nation is vulnerable to sudden shortages in basic raw materials . " Last week the Senate subcommittee on energy and mineral resources continued hearings on how to expand domestic production of strategic materials and start increasing the small American stockpile . <P> Reagan has given the General Services Administration $100 million to start buying as many as 15 materials for the National Defense Stockpile . In addition to high-temperature metals used in jet engines , such as cobalt , titanium and columbium , the Government will consider buying oddities like sisal fibers , a key ingredient for rope ; castor-bean oil , a high-quality lubricant ; and pyrethrum , an insecticide . While the amounts are not yet great , they represent a new direction in policy . Said Congressman James Santini , a Democrat from Nevada , " This is both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The National Defense Stockpile was started in 1939 and grew rapidly during the Korean War , when the U.S. committed $8 billion to expand production of some 90 strategic materials and subsequently stockpiled them in more than 100 locations around the U.S. Manganese and chromium were stored in huge outdoor dumps , and rubber was cached in refrigerated warehouses . The goal was to have enough material to sustain military production and meet industrial needs during a three-year war . <P> But in the early 1970s the Government started selling off its strategic hope chest in order to cut down on imports and improve the balance of payments . The result is that the stockpile is sadly depleted . Only 21 of the 62 basic materials in storage are now in sufficient supply to meet national security requirements . For instance , the U.S. imports virtually all of its platinum-group metals , which are used for oil-refining equipment and to make catalytic converters for automobiles . Yet the Government has stockpiled just 35% of the amount of platinum that it believes the country needs to hold in reserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has large strategic minerals resources , plans to reduce exports and step up purchases on the world market in competition with the West . That could endanger U.S. supplies of chromium and platinum , for example . A study by Dr. Daniel Fine of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology 's Mining and Minerals Research Institute concluded last year that the Soviet Union is becoming a net purchaser of key minerals as a way of protecting its own reserves . Said Interior Secretary James Watt : " Our dependence on foreign supplies jeopardizes our defense posture . We think we are really confronted with the possibility of a resource war .
