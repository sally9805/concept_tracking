The days of the " double nickel "  --  as truckers call the widely scorned and narrowly enforced 55-m.p.h. speed limit  --  appear to be numbered . First enacted in 1974 in response to the oil shortage , the 55-m.p.h. law was preserved long after the energy drought turned into a glut because the lower speed saves lives as well as fuel . <P> But last week Congress determined that it could no longer keep within the bounds of the snail-paced speed limit . By a narrow margin of 217 to 206 , the House voted to allow state governments to increase the limit to 65 m.p.h. on most interstate highways . The Senate followed suit by a clear majority . The new law applies specifically to rural areas , but nearly 80% of the planned 43,489 miles of the interstate system will be affected . <P> The increase was a victory for Congressmen from the wide open spaces of the West , where freewheeling constituents feel cooped up by the old limit . As Democrat Pat Williams of Montana explained to his more constricted colleagues , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve out at the end , 60 miles of straight stretch , and sometimes you traverse that entire 60 miles and you only pass two cars . My friends , on the way to talk to 20 people in Montana , I run over 15 jackrabbits . " Republican Dick Cheney of Wyoming echoed his neighbor : " Our Western rural interstates are uncrowded , straight and safe . " <P> Not so fast , partner , was the reply of Democrat James Howard of New Jersey . Howard , chairman of the House Public Works and Transportation Committee , has been fighting to preserve the old speed limit to preserve lives . The nation 's highest rural fatality rates , he maintained , are out West : Nevada is first , followed by Utah , Alaska , Arizona and Montana . " The No. 1 cause ( ( of deaths ) ) is not drinking and driving , " said Howard . " The No. 1 cause is speed . " <P> Howard 's argument is fueled by solid evidence . The National Safety Council estimates that the 55-m.p.h. limit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrat William Lehman of Florida cited statistics showing that the increase from 55 to 65 will cause an additional 500 to 1,000 deaths a year . Supporting the increase , contended Lehman , was " like casting a vote in favor of crashing one or two Boeing 747s every year . " <P> There is an outside chance that drivers may have to dawdle along at 55 despite Congress 's green light for the 10-m.p.h. increase . The new speed limit is a rider to an $88 billion authorization bill for highways and mass transit that may be vetoed by the President . Ronald Reagan , who is all for upping the speed limit , feels that the bill is on the expensive side . Congressmen , however , want those federal dollars for their states , and will gun their engines to fight a veto .
