you could have seen them on the street corners of Missouri and Arkansas towns , dressed in Saturday attire , soliciting funds to restore a camp for underprivileged children at St. Louis . Or at Baton Rouge , in jeans and work shirts with rolled-up sleeves , building a playground for orthopedically handicapped kids . Canadians in Winnipeg saw those sleeves rolled up for five years during construction of the Centre of the Deaf . In FondsLeLocle , Switzerland , they worked to build a chair lift that saves children a three-hour walk to school in freezing weather . Visit any one of some 8,100 communities worldwide , and you 'll find these men giving their time and discovering muscles they never knew they had to improve the quality of life for their neighbors in need . You could be forgiven for mistaking these men in sweat-stained grubbies for moonlighters working by the hour . But whether they are dressed for business or for their professions , a gold-edged pin emblazoning each lapel sets them apart . It 's a small pin , featuring the single letter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ volunteer organizations in the world . The word " Kiwanis " is American Indian for " to make oneself known . " At a time donating an estimated $300 million in time . This huge organization began in a Detroit tailor shop in 1914 , when a bespectacled man named Allen S. Browne called upon tailor Joseph G. Prance with the idea of organizing a fraternal club of business and professional men . Prance was interested , and " The Supreme Lodge Benevolent Order Brothers " was formed . The name Kiwanis came later , probably when someone was trying to arrange the original on a lapel button . Today , Kiwanis has established 8,100 clubs in 79 countries and has a membership of 309,186 . Tomorrow there will be more . College , high-school and grade-school clubs included , the K-Family totals 417,000 . Its theme of " We Build " extends beyond membership to service projects , fund-raising projects and character . And certainly not the least of Kiwanis ' building triumphs is the new national headquarters at Indianapolis , Indiana . I went there to meet Kiwanis International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one talks long with this intense , long-time Kiwanian from Tyler , Texas , without itching to roll up his own sleeves and get into the act . Said a long-time friend and business associate , " Aubrey not only knows how to get you to say yes to a project , but he doing , " said that we all more than more . " Kiwanis International has more than 300,000 living testimonials to the old adage , " If you have a job to do , give it to a busy man . " Inspired to accomplish together what they would never attempt on their own , these business and professional men have left their trademark around the globe . Take the much-needed playground at Baton Rouge , Louisiana . Curious about why a man with tender palms would surrender his golfing time and perhaps risk a disc working on such a project , I called Exxon chemical engineer John T. Roberts of the Baton Rouge club . Roberts is a former president of Kiwanis International . " The idea originated special-education teacher our club to ask for support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a donation of $150 to add to a fund for materials to build this playground for orthopedically handicapped children . She said these kids had no place to play ; that the ones with two good legs , in their exuberance , ran over the ones in wheelchairs . " So our club began to look into the situation , " he continued . " In Three international presidents of Kiwanis ( below ) , James Troyer of Circle K , Aubrey E. Irby and Matt Perrine of Key Club , discuss volunteerism . A Kiwanis volunteer project is pictured at right . dug postholes , poured cement , set the equipment in place and " had a good time doing it , " said Roberts . " During the operation , a local TV crew came out and took pictures , " he laughingly recalled . " And there I was , shovel in hand , on the evening news with my wife watching . She asked me how come I never did anything like that at home . I said , ' Because it 's not as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become the Boston-based Kiwanis Pediatric Trauma Institute , as well as the answer to many a prayer , was formulated in the minds of two Maine Kiwanians . David Lockwood , enthusiastic program manager of the institute , pointed out that in New England 700 children die and 2,500 are permanently disabled annually by traumatic injuries . In 1980 the Kiwanis Foundation of New England joined the New England Medical Center to make plans for meeting the man-sized problem . " Facilities , special child-size equipment and experience to treat the child are beyond the resources of many communities , " Lockwood said . " But we now have the world 's first regional system combining continued on page 94 transportation , treatment and rehabilitation exclusively for pediatric trauma victims . Whenever a physician treating an injured child determines that emergency care is required , " he said , " a fully equipped and staffed medical helicopter is dispatched to the referring hospital . With a five-minute launch time and a two-mile-per-minute speed , the medical crew provides safe and rapid transport . " Kiwanians are also concerned for the families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy burned on more than 60 percent of his body , " Lockwood said . " The president of the local Kiwanis club and his wife picked up the child 's mother and drove her to Boston so she could be with her injured son . " That 's really one of the intangibles Kiwanis offers . Getting down to figures , Lockwood said , the Kiwanis Foundation of New England and its 10,000 Kiwanians have pledged to raise $245,000 annually toward the trauma institute 's $800,000 budget . And so it goes around the world . In the Bahamas , the project is immunization ; in Alberta , Canada , a drug campaign . ( The entire K-Family was out in force supporting Nan cy Reagan 's TV program " The Chemical People , " dealing with drug and alcohol abuse . ) Elmhurst , Illinois , Kiwanians employ a puppet to warn kids of " stranger danger . " The combined Kiwanis clubs of Tempe , Arizona , gave that city a $500,000 park . The Rock Valley , Iowa , club helps children with muscular dystrophy ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio club focuses on driver 's education , one in Ontario , on volunteers and in Miami , the Little Havana Festival . Aubrey Irby can go on for an hour or so recounting these Kiwanis ventures and adventures . " The challenges and opportunities of this coming year are great indeed , " he said , running his hand over an enviable mane of silver hair . " Under our international umbrella theme of ' Seek the Widening Path , ' our Major Emphasis Program for 1984 will be ' Enrich the World of the Handicapped . ' " President Irby explained that Kiwanis ' broad commitment covers the mentally as well as the physically handicapped and all ages , from infants to people of 40 and 50 . " Take my home town of Tyler , " he said . " With 80,000 population , I believe it 's fairly typical . And probably out of 300 people under age 18 in various degrees of mental or physical impairment , only a small percentage are able to go to a child-development center . Kiwanis International is strongly in favor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a volunteer organization to take over the work than to send one dollar to Washington and get ten cents back to do the job . " Of the possible 300 handicapped people in Tyler , " Irby continued , " we have gone into the homes of exactly 29 people . And the gap between 29 and 300 is pretty big . " Mainline Kiwanians are helped in their task by younger groups . James D. Troyer , president of Circle K International , directs the world 's largest collegiate service organization . Its 12,000 coed members , 800 clubs strong in seven countries , put their youthful minds and muscles into numerous Kiwanis projects . " Our particular thrust this year , " said Troyer , having just arrived at world headquarters from a private college in Washington state , " is working with families . My own club just finished painting a house for a family that could n't afford to have it done . There are so many that need this ' hands on ' kind of help , " he said . " They may get money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone to roll up his sleeves and pitch in ? " Troyer 's 60-member club works with children at a battered women 's shelter . " We take them roller skating , to plays on campus , the state fair  --  any number of activities , " he said . " We also raised funds for a huge Junglegym for a child-care center for emotionally disturbed kids . " At the Atlanta Circle K convention where Troyer was elected , 1,000 Circle K members went down to donate blood to the Atlanta chapter of the American Red Cross . Talk about blood , sweat and tears ! The Georgia governor recognized them by issuing a special citation . Kiwanis is in high schools , too . Matt Perrine , a senior at Walker High in Jasper , Alabama , is president of Key Club International , which has 108,000 members . The Key Club theme for ' 84 is " Confront Confusion  --  Discover Direction . " These young members confront confusion by becoming more aware of themselves , their families , their peers and what they want from life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and at the community . Certainly not confusing are the clubs ' accomplishments . They range from a Teachers ' Appreciation Day to buying things for the school , from cheering grandparents in nursing homes to working with mentally disturbed kids . One club bought a computer device to help a child with cerebral palsy to read . Another club has entered The Guinness Book of World Records by collecting and lining up 4.2 miles of pennies on their gym floor . The money then went to the Shriners ' Hospital for Crippled Children . Yet another group of Kiwanians comes in even smaller sizes  --  the Builders Club . Its members , ages 12 through 15 , are nonetheless as determined as their big brothers when it comes to helping others , serving their schools and improving their communities . Kiwanians have never been ones to pat themselves on the back . In fact , they keep a rather low profile , and O.K. 'd this article only because , unlike the Marines , they are looking for more than just a few good men . They are looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done . " We are putting a major effort on growth , " Irby told me . " I 'm persuaded  --  in fact , I know ? " he said , " that there are thousands of communities of 3,000 population or more here in North America without a Kiwanis club . And there are as many clubs that need more workers to do more good . " So , when was the last time you rolled up your sleeves ?
