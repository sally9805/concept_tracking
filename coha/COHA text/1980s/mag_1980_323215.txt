Ford courts the ladies <P> Detroit has a long tradition of condescending to women . Advertising and even the cars themselves are often designed to be strong statements of masculinity . When automakers bothered with women at all , they usually came up with gimmicks like the " La Femme " Dodge with parasols to match the seat covers . <P> Now the Ford Motor Co. has suddenly discovered that women have enormous influence in the auto marketplace . According to company research , women last year bought 39% of all new cars sold in the U.S. Writes the awed company in a marketing brief just sent to dealers : " The same dainty little hand that pushes the shopping cart has a viselike grip on the economic pulse of the nation . " <P> Ford 's studies showed that 46% of licensed drivers are women and that they prefer to drive small cars . So the company has belatedly decided to pitch some of its selling at the ladies . Many Mustang ads now show a pretty blond sitting behind the wheel , while a white stallion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women are more open to trying new products and much more concerned than men about gas mileage , dealer service and pickup . It also instructed dealers to stop patronizing women , suggesting instead that they " talk to women as you would to any young-thinking , intelligent people . " <P> Another ploy to move the new Ford Escorts and Mercury Lynxes out of the back lots is a 60-page paperback called How to Love the Car in Your Life , written by Anne and Charlotte Ford , the jet-set daughters of Henry II . They dispense tips on driving , traveling and motoring etiquette , and provide a glossary to take the mystery out of automotive innards . A lot of men might profitably read it too . <P> Whatever the sales pitch , something now seems to be working better for Detroit . Helped by the introduction of the new Chrysler K-cars , Escorts and Lynxes , auto sales were up 11.6% for the first ten days of October .                  @ @ @
