How high is up ? It might be better to ask how high movie ticket prices can rise , because the sky seems to be the limit . In December two theater chains raised prices from $6 to $7 at 48 screens in Manhattan . That follows a jump from $5 ( or $5.50 ) to $6 in the spring of 1985 and means New Yorkers are paying perhaps 40% more than they were 2 1/2 years ago for their Saturday night at the movies . <P> So far , the fare hikes have been confined to the Big Apple . Cineplex Odeon , the Canadian-based chain that first raised the tariff , claims it has no plans to boost prices at its 1,614 other screens in North America . In Hollywood , as well as in Washington , Boston and Chicago , $6 is still tops , while $5.50 gets you through the door in Houston , and $5 is the limit in Atlanta and Cleveland . But Gordon Crawford , a California entertainment analyst , predicts that by the end of 1988 fans in Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prospect . " Movies are better than ever , " says Bob Singer , 32 , standing in line for Moonstruck , " and I do n't mind paying more for a better product .

The message : people pay to see the films they want to see  --  and ca n't be paid to see the others . Indeed , the mayor broke his own boycott to see Ironweed , which , he complained to Variety afterward , " was n't even worth $5. "
