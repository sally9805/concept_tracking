THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment AYOUNG stockbroker friend writes : I am leaving Wall Street soon after the first of the year for the West Coast . Now , the thing is how to adapt without quite leaving my comfy Northeast self behind and what to do with all the presents from my East Coast Christmas . I know I need a plan of action  --  the old self loves plans of action so here 's one I 'm still knock-ing the kinks out of : First week  --  Wear all white clothes together . Cut buttons off button-down shirts . Detach chain from pocket watch and fling casually around bared neck . Use one Argyle sock as bootie for new Ping putter , saving- other sock for wiping down as yet unacquired red sports car . Second week  --  Paint a line down each side of boxer shorts and wear for jogging on beach . Give amulet of N.Y.C. subway tokens to beautiful girl on beach . Place lock of her hair in pocket watch . Wrap tie around head warrior style and begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attache case and invite beaCh girl to lunch . Make chili pie in striking tartan design by crisscrossing lettuce leaves and beans and filling in the little squares with guacamole . Use handkerchiefs from Brooks Brothers For napkins . Fourth week  --  Buy a cockatoo and a guitar . Cut up flannel shirts , sheets , and boogies for wiping down new red Porsche . Braid hair a la Willie Nelson and top off with how tie . ? ? The Ride FIr . Y-ONE horses , each carrying a rider in full foxhunting attire , headed . up Amsterdam Avenue on a recent Sunday morning to begin the Fourth Annual Christmas Ride of the Claremont Riding Academy , which is on Eighty-ninth Street between Amsterdam and Columbus . The riders , wearing black boots , ivory-colored breeches , white shirts , white ties , black hunting jackets , and black velvet riding caps or , in some cases , bowlers or silk top hats , kept their horses to a walk , single file , past Sammy 's Grocery ; Eva , AlteraciOn Shop ; B. I. Rosenhaus &; Sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ la Salsa San Miguel Record Shop ; and Bus Stop Meat Market . They turned right on Ninetieth Street , nudged their steeds uphill toward Arthur 's Stationery/Luncheonette , crossing Columbus Avenue with the light , and continued east on Ninetieth Street . At Central Park West , outriders held back two aggressive taxis and a No. 10 bus , and they entered the Park . At a slow posting trot , the Ride proceeded north , rounded the Reservoir , moved south past the Guggenheim Museum , and headed north again , into the upper reaches of the Park . As horses and riders warmed up , the horses ' gaits lengthened . Margot jacqz , a free-lance architectural writer , who was hatless , rode Birchbark , an Appaloosa ; Tom Delaney , the director of operations planning and strategy for Merrill Lynch International , rode Mr. Right ; and Lou Accurso , the manager of forecasting for Con Ed , rode Goliath . Several dozen other riders bounced pleasantly along on , among other horses , Atticus , Beausox , Calypso , Drifter , Eeyore , Grand Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Left , Ramses , Sun Tan , and Venetian . As the riders passed the starting line of a New York Road Runners Club race , several hundred runners stared with the stoical look of the conclusively one-upped . A poodle bayed . And a jogger chugging through the trees in a pastel sweatsuit shouted , " God save the Queen ! " At the head of the column , in huntsmen 's knee-length scarlet " pinks " adorned with brass buttons and a green felt collar , rode Paul Novograd , Claremont 's proprietor and the Master of the Ride , on Willow . Beside him rode his bride of one week , the former Nancy Cohen , on Mardi Gras . " The idea of the Christmas Ride is to celebrate the New Year in a splendid way , " he told us . ( We had ventured to join them , on a Claremont horse named Warrior . ) " The idea came to me one summer evening a few years ago , when , after the hire horses had come back from the Park , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink . Just before that , I 'd been to Ireland hunting , and I thought it would be a fine idea to get a group of riders together in formal dress once a year and charge around the Park . The green collar " ? here he touched his neck ? " is the same green as the Parks Department green , to indicate my standing as the founding and only member of the Central Park Hounds . The Christmas group that has evolved is a complete mixture , and it changes every year . We have riders here who are waitresses , and psychiatrists and over there , in the top hat and shadbelly coat , is Chrystine Jones , who directs THE NEW YORKER Street and York Avenue , and scientific chairman of the Neurosciences Research Program as well as director of the N. S. I. Fifty-three years old , tall , slim ; graying black hair , sharp eyes behind **25;6765;TOOLONG eyeglasses ; fast-walking , fast-talking , articulate ; master raconteur . One look at his face and you can be sure that nothing is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine , for determining the chemical structure of the key molecule of immunity , the antibody molecule . What DNA is to genetics , antibodies are to immunology . His accomplishment rationalized the science of immunology and brought order into the field ; with the knowledge of that molecule 's structure , the mechanism for the defense of the human body against foreign invasion became clear . Today , in his Rockefeller lab , Dr. Edelman is working , with his close friend and colleague Professor Bruce Cunningham and a group of molecular embryologists , toward an understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which higher organisms are constructed during the period of embryonic development . Just outside Dr. Edelman 's lab , in the hall , are two glass cases , containing a model of the Nobel Prize antibody molecule and a model of another molecule , from the jack bean , which hinds to sugar on the surface of cells and is called Concanavalin A " One billion billion of that molecule would fill an average-size thimble , " Dr. Edelman told us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells divide . " Unless he is out of town giving a lecture or attending a conference , Dr. Edelman , who is married and has three grown children , works in his lab every day and a good part of every night , weekends and holidays included . Once in a while , he takes a few hours off to play the violin in chamber-music groups of professional musicians . He had trained to become a concert violinist until 1950 , when he decided to go to medical school . The Laboratory of Molecular and Developmental Biology . In it are Dr. Edelman 's hook-Iined study , with three picture windows looking out on the East River ; a conference room ; a cold room ( four degrees Celsius ) , for dealing with molecules that lose their shape at room temperature ; a colder room ( minus twenty degrees Celsius ) , for even more sensitive materials ; a tissue-culture room , for growing ern hryos in eggs and cancer cells in bottles ; a special room for mice who are protected from germs of any kind ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's programmed to do a refinement of electron-density maps from X-ray crystallographic analysis ) , a micro-tome ( for cutting tissue specimens a couple of molecules thick ) , laser microscopes , an automated amino-acid sequencer , which , Dr. Edelman said , is " a kind of molecular salami slicer , " and a lot of other equipment used in biochemistry and virology . " We just had a fantastic look at a molecule from the brain that we 've been working on for the last eight years , " Dr. Edelman told us , with a combination of enthusiasm , reverence , and passion which we had n't seen in a long time in anybody over the age of seven . " A colleague at another university took a picture of the molecule . It 's so thrilling to actually see it  --  to see what I 've been imagining . What 's most exciting and most revealing is the shape of things . That 's what counts . Seeing it clarifies your thinking . This molecule is called the neuralcell-adhesion molecule . It 's present , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . When it changes , the other major forces guiding neural development are modified . If such a mechanism turns out to he universal , then no two brains are alike . And diversity and individuality are the keys to the brain and its functions . That individuality is what Darwin realized was the essential issue in biology . " On being pressed for more information about the shape of his molecule , Dr. Edelman explained that he could n't say any more , because it is the custom of scientists to wait for an independent and objective review by other scientists before revealing their discoveries to the general public . " I do my research here in my own lab , " Dr. Edelman went on . " It 's my life function . And now , like all those who come to the Neurosciences Institute , which is totally separate from the lab and independent of the Rockefeller but just a minute 's walk away , I go there to discuss my ideas and projects with other scientists . The Institute could n't he in a better place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Neurosciences Research Program , or N.R.P. , founded THE NEW YOKICEft dividual has a different brain map , which is dynamic and is established by competitive principles ) , and " Theoretical Aspects of Developmental Biology " ( primary processes of development , like cell division , cell adhesion , and cell death ; the space between our fingers , e.g. , is a memorial to cells that die , for otherwise we would have webbed fingers ) . When we asked Dr. Edelman to tell us his ideas about the brain and how to study it , he looked as though his enthusiasm might nut he contained . " The structure of the human brain for thought is as challenging as the ultimate structure of matter , " he told us . " Of all the organs in the human body , the brain is the most complicated , consisting of more than ten billion nerve cells . I believe that the uniqueness of each human brain proves that our nature is horn in freedom and individuality . In other words , it pays to be you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain as a kind of computer . If that is so , who is telling whom what to do ? Who is writing the program ? " Dr. Edelman laughed . " The brain , in its workings , is a selective system , more like evolution itself than like computation , " he went on . " That is my basis for understanding brain function , and it forms a seamless web with our understanding of how life developed on earth . The structure of the nervous system , that is , is not strictly determined by genes . Like the theory of evolution , this theory  --  which I call neuronal group selection ? puts an enormous emphasis on the importance of individual variation . The most complicated material object in the world as we know it is the human brain . The brain is not a clockwork machine . It is not a digital computer . We are part of that complex web of natural selection which has itself evolved a selection machinery called our brain . In each one of us there lies the richness of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a marvellous tissue in which the hope of our survival lies . So " ? Dr. Edelman smiled ? " we need to add something besides molecular analyses to our description of the structure of the mental world . " " What 's the something ? " we asked . " An adequate theory of selection , " Dr. Edelman said . " What that requires is a mixture of chance and necessity , and a kind of remembered program from the successes of the past . That 's what we call adaptation . " He ? smiled again . " I 'll tell you my favorite old story about adaptive motives , chance , and necessity , " he said . " A gentleman jealously suspected that his girl was seeing another suitor . One hot summer night , he came home early to their apartment , furiously searched everywhere for the hypothetical suitor , but could n't find anyone . Then he looked out the window , and on the fire escape below lie saw a man loosening his collar and wiping his brow . In a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it through the window , aimed it carefully , and dropped it on the man 's head . Then he fell dead of exertion . The scene switches to Heaven . Three people are being admitted . St. Peter tells them they have fulfilled all the requirements but the last , which is to describe the nature of their deaths . The first man said , ' Well , I thought there was some hanky-panky going on , so I came home early , looked all over the place , and finally saw this fellow on the fire escape below . I must have had an adrenaline fit . I lifted this refrigerator  --  something way beyond my powers  --  and dropped it on his head ? and then must have had a heart attack . ' The second man said , ' I do n't know . It was a hot summer night , so I stepped out onto the fire escape , loosened my collar , and wiped my brow , and a refrigerator fell on my head . ' The third man said , ' I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own business . ' " Dr. Edelman laughed as though he were hearing the joke from someone else and for the first time . " Chance and necessity , " he said . " The brain is not a computer . It 's more like a garden . Every time the brain does something , it 's different . As Keats wrote , in ' Ode to Psyche ' : And in the midst of this wide quietness A rosy sanctuary will I dress With the wreath 'd trellis of a working brain , With buds , and bells , and stars without a name , With all the gardener Fancy e'er could feign , Who , breeding flowers , will never breed the same . " You know , science and poetry begin in the same place . But the poets really do see things first . "
