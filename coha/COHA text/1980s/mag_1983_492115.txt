HOW TO HAVE THE TASTIEST YARD IN TOWN By plotting your garden strategy carefully , you can bring forth both bouquets and banquets from the same small patch of ground . by Carolyn Jabs ? 7 feel as if I have to choose bet tween pretty and practical , " laments a gardener friend . " I want vegetables and flowers , but I just do n't seem to have enough time for both . " How many gardeners get caught in the same predicament ? Those of us who spend our precious gardening hours in the vegetable patch usually eat well but are vaguely embarrassed by the neglected beds at the front of the house . Those who are scrupulous about lawns , shrubs and flower beds often feel that they simply ca n't bother with vegetables . The answer to this gardening dilemma is to erase the imagi-nary line between productive and attractive . So many plants are both . And those of us who have limited time and/or space for gardening might as well lavish our attentions on plants that do double duty  --  appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this idea sounds rev-olutionary to American gar-deners who have become accustomed to strict segregation between edible and ornamental plants . Seed companies have perpetuated the idea with catalogs that carefully separate vegetables and flowers , as though vegetables do n't produce flowers and flowers never produce edible fruits . Perhaps we make the distinction because lawns , shrubs and at least a token geranium seem like the obligation of every responsible homeowner . Fruits and vegetables , on the other hand , are a discretionary hobby . Indeed , for many years , food growing was perceived as a low-status activity , according to Rosalind Creasey , author of The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping ( Sierra Club Books , 1982 ) . " Many Americans who left the farm for the city came to consider food growing to be straight from Hicksville , ' " she writes . " For many years , professional designers and style setters discouraged the use of food-producing plants in the garden . " Today , all that is changing . Many families now raise their own food because they can get better quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health favor homegrown food because it can be grown without chemicals and harvested when it is most nutritious . Others find it wasteful to use precious resources such as water and petroleum-based fertilizers to raise " useless " ornamentals . And still others find that raising their own food is a natural part of the shift away from convenience at any cost towards quality and self-reliance . The surprising thing is that most people who start raising their own food try to add a vegetable plot , a berry patch or an orchard on top of traditional chores such as weeding the flower bed , mulching the shrubs and mowing the lawn . The result is that they often feel torn , like my friend , between pretty and practical . The idea behind edible landscaping is to weave edibles and ornamentals into a seamless landscape that is both appealing and appetizing . Perhaps the easiest way to get involved in edible landscaping is to make better use of the food-producing plants that are already growing in your yard . Do you depend on a graceful sugar maple for summer shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at least once in the spring for sap . Does a stand of pine trees protect your home from winter winds ? Find out whether they are pinon pines , stone pines or one of the other varieties that produce the pine nuts prized by gourmets . Black walnut , hickory and beechnut trees are other favorite shade trees that yield a bonus crop of nuts . Black walnuts should be hulled promptly , because the dark black hulls can give the nuts an off-flavor . Hickory nuts and beechnuts , however , can be gathered , dried for a week or two and stored to be cracked and eaten when you need them . Trees are n't the only source of food in the typical ornamental garden . Many flowers can also be eaten . Most people know that nasturtiums can be tossed into a summer salad , but fewer realize that gladiolas taste a lot like lettuce and tulips taste rather like fresh peas . In some cases , such as with Shinguki , you can eat your flower and have it , too . The spring greens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stir-fried dishes by Oriental cooks . The plants that escape eating produce cheery daisylike flowers later in the season . Day tithes are another ornamental that is considered a delicacy in the Far East . The flowers , of course , bloom for only one day . The next day , they can be harvested for dinner . Remove the center part of each flower and include the buds in stir-fried dishes . Or dip the blossoms into a tempura batter made from one egg yolk , two-thirds of a cup of cold water and three-quarters of a cup of flour . Deep-fat fry the flowers , and serve them with dip as an exotic hors d'oeuvre . Other edible flowers include marigolds , the dried petals of which make a saffronlike seasoning for egg and rice dishes ; sunflowers , with centers that , when boiled , taste like artichoke hearts ; and rugose roses , which produce hips rich in vitamin C. Although some of your favorite ornamentals may offer an edible bonus , do n't taste everything in the yard . There are many poisonous ornamentals , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before eating anything not ordinarily classified as " food , " talk to your local extension agent or make a positive identification in a handbook of edible plants . If you want to be certain that the plants in your landscape are edible , you 'll need to deliberately substitute food-producing plants for ornamental trees and shrubs . This does n't mean ripping out existing plantings . Instead , integrate edible alternatives into the landscaping you 've already done . If you want trees that flower in the spring , think about apples , almonds , cherries or apricots , which will also produce a delicious crop later in the year . When selecting an edible ornamental tree , consider all the usual variables such as climate and soil conditions , but also pay attention to the mature shape of the tree , the length of the flower season and other ornamental factors . Dwarf trees are particularly suited to the edible landscape because they are easier to care for . Hedges , too , may as well be productive . Instead of rhododendrons , continued on page 102 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same kind of soil . The blueberries will repay your effort with delicate flowers in the spring , stunning foliage in the fall and , of course , blueberries in the summer . Currants , gooseberries arid elderberries also produce attractive shrubs as well as fruits that are virtually unavailable in the markets . If you want a hedge that will serve as a physical as well as a visual barrier , try blackberry or raspberry , which will grow as impenetrable as privet . Of course , starting a walnut grove , an apricot orchard or a gooseberry hedge requires an investment of both time and money . If you 'd like to start eating your landscape as early as next year , you 'll need to do some planning now to figure out how you can blend annual fruits and vegetables into your ornamental beds . Begin by thinking back over the vegetable gardens you saw this year . Did you find yourself stopping to admire any particular vegetable ? In my own garden , the peppers always stand out . I like everything about them , from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensuously shaped produce . Since I only set out about a dozen plants , it 's easy to slip them in among the flowers , making sure , of course , that they are close enough to " kiss " for pollination . One of the advantages of growing plants for their looks as well as their fruits is that you 're tempted to try new and interesting varieties . Among peppers , for example , you can experiment with Goldenbell 's chubby yellow peppers , Cayenne 's hot red daggers or Cherry Sweet 's miniature red pickling peppers . Eggplant , another show stopper , also invites innovation when you think of it as an ornamental plant . Handsome as the purple fruits are , they have competition from white varieties such as White Italian and yellow varieties such as Golden Yellow , which has fruits the size of lemons , adding a delicate touch of gold to your garden . Tomatoes , a cousin to the eggplant , were grown as an ornamental by no less a gardener than Thomas Jefferson , who , like other Americans at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Today , you can enjoy both the flavor and looks of tomatoes if you plant determinate varieties that will be more compact . Try filling an outdoor hanging basket with a variety such as Minibel , which will produce a red cascade of tiny tomatoes . Hanging baskets and other containers are , in fact , one of the best ways to solve a basic problem of landscaping with annual edibles  --  what to do after the harvest is over and the appearance of the plant begins to deteriorate . The new bush varieties of squash and cucumber , for example , are good-looking through the middle of the summer , but then begin to look spent and rangy . If you 've grown them in tubs on wheels , you can position them so they 're prominent when they 're attractive and hidden when they 're not . Another alternative is to plant crops that can be harvested early among flowers that will spread and close gaps when the vegetables are gone . This technique works particularly well with early root crops such as radishes , baby beets and tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacy foliage that enhances the beauty of the flowers . Edibles also do nicely at the edge of the garden . By sowing a two-inch band of leaf lettuce around your flower beds , you 'll have a border that is lush and luscious . When you want salad , simply thin out the leaves . For a variegated effect  --  in your border and your salad bowl  --  mix together seeds from three contrasting varieties , such as crinkly Salad Bowl , wine-colored Ruby and smooth-leaved Crispy Sweet . Another border worth considering is one of Alpine strawberries , which have two advantages over other strawberries . First , they do n't send out runners , so the border stays tidy . Second , they are true perennials that produce summer-long crops of tiny sweet berries year after year . Perhaps the most dramatic border plant is flowering kale , which produces platters of color when it 's touched by frost in the fall . Flower catalogs stress its showycolors  --  red on green or white on green  --  but often neglect the fact that it can be eaten like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of the garden , try using peas to conceal an unsightly fence or wall in the spring . By the time the other plants in the garden are tall enough to create their own landscape , the peas will be picked and the plants will be ready to be pulled . Pay attention to the length of the vines when you select your varieties . Dwarf Gray Sugar , a snow pea , has attractive violet blossoms , but is only two feet tall . Sugar Snap peas , on the other hand , grow five-to six-foot vines and will require trellising . Other garden plants not traditionally considered ornamental become attractive when they are trellised . Pole beans , for example , are exuberant climbers , but many gardeners have ostracized them because of the extra work of setting up poles . Take advantage of their habits , however , to plan the arbor continued on following page Botts continued from page 33 " I just said that to see if I could tempt you to lie out of it . And I am pleased with the results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deception , I feel you are basically an honest man . And although you , Mr. Beasley , sometimes tell the truth , I feel you are basically a liar . So I am going to do business with Mr. Botts . Now let 's get out of here . " We refueled the boat from the Earthworm tractor and sailed back to Mott 's Landing . The Earthworm tractor towed the Behemoth tractor through the swamp back to town . Mr. Montgomery has signed up for no less than 24 Earthworm tractors and one boat . For the past two days , I have been sitting around in the sun and resting myself after my somewhat arduous labors . This morning I asked Mr. Montgomery what I thought was a good question , and I received a good reply . " Mr. Montgomery , " I said , " considering your claim that truth and honesty are such important factors in business , how come you have practiced all these deceptions  --  such as telling me that your fishing tackle was so valuable ' ? " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind telling lies myself . I just do n't like other people to lie to me . " Yours , Alexander Botts Tastiest Yard continued from page 103 you 've always wanted . Some parents create a memorable playhouse for their children by setting up 12 poles teepee style and planting beans at the base of each pole . By midsummer , the children have a leafy hideaway . Although you can raise standard climbing varieties such as Kentucky Wonder and Blue Lake , you may also want to try something special , such as Scarlet Runner Beans , with their flashy red flowers ; Royal Burgundy Beans , the purple pods of which turn green when you cook them ; or White Dutch Runner , an old-time variety that is particularly attractive to hummingbirds . Perhaps the easiest way to get started with ornamental edibles is to slip a few herbs into the flower garden . Herbs such as borage and chives have charming flowers that will seem right at home , and herbs such as parsley , sage and rosemary have foliage that blends nicely with other plants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camomile , for instance , makes an acceptable ground cover in areas that do n't have a lot of traffic . Mow it twice a year to keep it manageable and , of course , pluck and dry the flowers for a soothing home-brewed tea . Thyme is another ground-hugging herb that is useful for filling in spots where the mower ca n't easily manage . By now , you may be tempted to convert your entire yard to edible plants , but go slow . For an edible landscape to work , it must be matched to your appetites  --  both for food and for gardening . If you find that you do n't care for elderberries , planting them instead of spirea will have been wasted effort . With annual vegetables , you can do your own experimenting to find the varieties that best suit your taste . With berries and fruit trees , try to taste the varieties you are considering , perhaps by visiting fruit growers in your area . At the very least , read varietal descriptions carefully . A second consideration is that edibles often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They may be fussier about fertility , watering and sunshine than the ornamentals that you 've been growing in the same spot . Do n't try to force a particular edible into a vacant landscape niche . It will retaliate by producing mediocre fruit . Instead , find out about each plant 's needs and try to match it to a spot where its needs will naturally be met . One of the best sources of information about using specific edibles in the landscape is the " Encyclopedia of Edibles " in The Complete Book of Edible Landscaping . Finally , like any other kind of landscape , edible landscaping requires a sense of how to position plants and props for pleas- ing and harmonious effects . For those of us who have always evaluated our vegetables by the number of days from seed to maturity , this requires looking again to see how tall they get , what color their leaves really are and when they flower . Then it 's time to plan  --  on paper , since plants do n't care that much for being moved from place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a single bed . Draw it on graph paper to get the dimensions right , and then start arranging the edibles that you find attractive and that seem likely to do well in that spot . Some professional designers cut out cardboard markers to represent the various elements in their designs . Others sketch ideas on tissue paper so they can lay one design on top of another . I find it helpful to cut out pictures from old seed catalogs so I can remember exactly what things look like . The important thing is to try out various combinations in your mind 's eye now . Would a froth of asparagus fern look nice behind the snapdragons ? Could you replace the dead tree at the corner of the yard with a butternut or a pecan ? Maybe you could slip some sweet potatoes into the geranium bed so their vines would fill in between the plants . With that kind of thinking , you 'll get both pretty and productive , so next year 's garden will look  --  and be  --  good enough to eat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
