txt // and Born in the Gardens ( 1979 ) in which middle-aged offspring gather round their mother after the death of their father . Set in Nichols 's native Bristol , the play recaptures something of the emotional validity of A Day in the Death of Joe Egg . A comparable trans-generational situation is explored more deeply in In Celebration ( 1969 ) by the Yorkshire dramatist , David Storey ( 1933 ? ) . Three sons of a miner come back home to celebrate the anniversary of their parents ' wedding . The values and attitudes of the allegedly better-educated and now middle-class sons are searchingly measured against those of their working-class origins . Storey had made his name as a dramatist with The Restoration of Arnold Middleton ( 1967 ) , a lively and amusing study of a schoolmaster who , in order to relieve domestic tension , plays the hearty , flamboyant classroom performer in his own home to the point of actual mental collapse . Storey 's preoccupation with mental unbalance emerges again in Home ( 1970 ) where the audience gradually learns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asylum . Their halting dialogue is symptomatic of broken contact between the surface and substance of human life . Storey was born in Wakefield , and so was David Mercer ( 1928 ? 80 ) whose After Haggerty ( 1970 ) has an interesting thematic relationship with Storey 's In Celebration . A retired train-driver from Yorkshire turns up to complicate the already complicated personal affairs of his son , Bernard Link , a drama critic . The concern with the triple dichotomies of the age gap , the education gap and the socialclass gap is here , however , a source of fun rather than of reflective unease . Similarly Mercer 's study of an aberrant and eccentric clergyman , Flint ( 1970 ) , derives its effectiveness from sparkling wit and epigram ? a fount of humour which dried up in Mercer 's later work . Another master of dramatic dialogue , Edward Bond ( 1934 ? ) , mines a vein of social indignation with ruthless thoroughness . The obscene murder of a baby by city thugs in-Saved ( 1966 ) is intended as a comment on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1971 ) revises Shakespeare extravagantly but unconvincingly , while Bingo ( 1973 ) cuts Shakespeare 's personal character in his later years cruelly down to size . A third dramatist to have come , like Storey and Mercer , from West Yorkshire is Alan Bennett ( 1934 ? ) . He has a verbal force and fluency which derive not only from the authentic exploitation of native idiom but also from the storage of a mind that is literary // without being academic . Hence the large-scale study in Getting On ( 1971 ) of a Labour MP who has transmuted living thought and action into hollow rhetoric . The Old Country ( 1977 ) , Bennet 's portrayal of a Philby-style exile in Moscow who receives visitors from home is a study laden with subtleties , emotional and dialectical , while Enjoy ( 1980 ) presents a couple in the last back-to-back house in Leeds , and makes a tremendous impact by brilliantly counterpointing their natural speech with the jargon of media men and social investigators .

Indeed Denis Johnston ( 1901 ? ) did so in both periods . His play The Moon in the Yellow River reached London in 1934 and The Scythe and the Sunset in 1959 . The former goes back to the Free State ? Republican conflict , the latter to the 1916 rising . I 3oth are plays of substance by an unduly neglected writer . Brian Friel ( 1929 ? ) made his first impact in 1964 with Philadelphia , Here I Come , which divides Gareth O'Donnell into two personae , public and private , in investigating the motives behind his decision to forsake Ireland for the United States . The subsequent play , The Freedom of the City ( 1973 ) , has justly been acclaimed as the best stage product of the current troubles in Northern Ireland . Set in Londonderry in 1970 , it fastens on three people who on the spur of the moment seek shelter in the town hall from troops who are dispersing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armed rebels , and they are shot when they leave the building . Living Quarters ( 1977 ) is a gravely intense and tragic study of a heroic Irish commandant at the peak of his career who has married a young wife . In these plays , and in Translations ( 1980 ) , Friel seems to be building up a corpus of work such as only a major dramatist could produce . The plays of Friel 's compatriot Hugh Leonard ( pseudonym of John Keyes Byrne ) ( 1926  --  ) , a writer of comparable percipience , have proved less readily exportable , perhaps because they are more sombre and more intensely confined in dimension . Leonard is a master of tension . The Poker Session ( 1963 ) keeps the audience on tenterhooks . Friends and family gather to meet a young man returning home from a lunatic asylum who has grudges to work off on some of them and whose state of mental health remains uncomfortably questionable .

William Butler Yeats ( 1865 ? 1939 ) was born in Dublin into a Protestant family with a long association with County Sligo . In I.undon he associated with Dowson and Lionel Johnson in the Rhymers ' Club . Back in Ireland , he became a leader of the Celtic Revival . He was in love with Maud Gonne , the nationalist , and remained deeply attached to her in spite of her refusal of him . The practical passions of his life were poetry , Irish culture and occult literature . What he drew from Irish folk lore and myth , and from interest in theosophy , hermetic studies , magic and cyclic theories of history , has made some of his poetry fully comprehensible only with the aid of annotations , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the personality stamped on his style carry the reader unresisting through formidable substance . The young Yeats , represented in earlier anthologies by I will arise and go now , and go to Innisfree ' and by When you are old and grey and full of sleep ' , was a master of rhythmic patterns and colourful , suggestive imagery : I would that we were , my beloved , white birds on the foam of the sea ! We tire of the flame of the meteor , before it can fade and flee ; And the flame of the blue star of twilight , hung low on the rim of the sky , Has awaked in our hearts , my beloved , a sadness that may not die . ( ' The White Birds ' , The Rose , 1893 ) The three poems cited above indulge moods of nostalgia , sadness // and dreamy escapism that suggest inability to cope . The indulgence of such moods , the use of Irish legend , and the entanglement of the immediately personal in the mythical by a rather staged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestive ness . But the early reliance on appeals to vague yearnings and unease gives little indication of the immense poetic stature Yeats was to achieve as he developed . The maturing was both a personal and a technical matter . The frustrated love of Maud Gonne played its part , and no doubt the sacrifice of life in the 1916 rising transformed Yeats 's personal involvement with his fellow countrymen , as the lines in Easter 1916 ' indicate : All changed , changed utterly : A terrible beauty is born . But the development was essentially that of a rigorous and ambitious craftsman who worked and reworked the drafts of his poems with persistent thoroughness . The upshot was that Yeats made poetry his servant : it became a vessel that could hold whatever he wanted to put into it , instead of a garment which he donned to address the world . There was eventually no limit on the moods and topics , no restriction to specific poses , to particular vocabulary or idiom . Yeats strenuously added to the interests and accents that poetry could cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utterance on the tip of his tongue . The passive melancholy and swooning music to be found among the exquisitely phrased lyrics of The Wind Among the Reeds ( 1899 ) were purged from his mature work . A sinewy strength is evident in Responsibilities ( 1914 ) and in The Wild Swans at Goole ( 1919 ) ( Coole Park was Lady Gregory 's home ) . Thereafter Yeats is a poet of sharp-edged complexity with a ruthless honesty and a reverberating striking-power : What shall I do with this absurdity ? O heart , 0 troubled heart ? this caricature , Decrepit age that has been tied to me As to a dog 's tail ? ( ' The Tower ' , from The Tower , 1928 ) His Platonic reverence for works of art as monuments of unageing // intellect ' inspires in him the cry to be gathered through his work into the artifice of eternity ' in Sailing to Byzantium ' ( The Tower ) . The use of astonishingly varied rhythmic and verbal patterns that are daily to hand in living conversation is now achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vitality . In the work of no other modem poet do we get the same sense of a master moving with consummate ease through all conceivable varieties of expression : Now his wars on God begin ; At stroke of midnight God shall win . ( The Four Ages of Man ' from A Full Moon in March , 1935 ) Yesterday he threatened my life . I told him that nightly from six to seven I sat at this table , ' The blinds drawn up . ( Beautiful Lofty Things ' from Last Poems , 1936 ? 9 ) The crisp and the casual , the formal and the informal , are equally his natural utterance . It is the versatility of form that compels wonder at one moment ; at the next it is the fervour and frankness of reflection . Poems such as A Prayer for my Daughter ' ( Michael Robartes and the Dancer , 1921 ) , A Dialogue of Self and Soul ' ( The Winding Stair and OtherPoems , 1933 ) and The Circus Animals ' Desertion ' ( Last Poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best Metaphysical poetry . The last named looks back on the masterful images ' of his early poetry ( the circus animals he put on show ) from his now enforced reliance on the foul rag-and-bone shop of the heart ' . In such work heart and brain move dynamically from line to line , and the reader is swept along by the current . With Yeats you are always in the company of an interesting and interested man . A near contemporary whose fame has scarcely stood the test of time was Sir Henry Newbolt ( 1862-1938 ) . His rollicking nautical verses , Drake 's Drum ' ( Drake he 's in his hammock an ' a thousand miles away ' ? one of the Songs of the Fleet aptly set to music by Sir Charles Stanford ) and his melodramatic ballad , He Fell Among " Thieves ' , out-kipling Kipling . ( The murderous thieves condemn him to die at dawn in north-west India , but he pictures the gray little 3 56 A Short History of English Literature church ' and the School Close ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ' There 's a breathless hush in the Close tonight ' ) has become a national joke about the public schools ( ' Play up ! Play up ! and play the game ! ' ) . John Masefieid ( 1878-1967 ) , Bridges 's successor as Laureate , was a true master of nautical bluster , as is evident from ' The Tarry Buccaneer ' and ' A Ballad of John Silver ' : We were schooner-rigged and rakish , with a long and lissome hull , And we flew the pretty colours of the cross-bones and the skull . Both poems are from Salt-Water Ballads ( 1902 ) . ' Sea-Fever ' ( ' I must go down to the seas again ' ) has the emotional spine that Yeats 's ' Innisfree ' lacks , while ' Cargoes ' has the imaginative clarity that Bridges 's ' A Passer-By ' lacks . Masefield 's easy fluency led him to narrative poetry . His vibrant tale , The Everlasting Mercy ( 1911 ) , presents in the first person the evangelical conversion of Saul Kane from prize-fighting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : From ' 61 to ' 67 I lived in disbelief of heaven ; I drunk , I fought , I poached , I whored , I did despite unto the Lord . First to be recognized among the war poets of 1914 to 1918 was Rupert Brooke ( 1887-1915 ) , though in fact he died so early in the struggle that little of his work was concerned with the war . Nevertheless his handsomeness of body and character , and his untimely death at Scyros , after leaving behind him at home the prophetic sonnet , ' The Soldier ' ( ' If I should die , think only this of me ' ) , made him a symbol of youth and promise heroically sacrificed at the call of country . The idolization of Brooke was justified by outbursts such as that of the sonnet , ' Peace ' ( ' Now , God be thanked who has matched us with this hour ' ) . But he was the poet of delicately mannered nostalgia for idealized Englishness ( unofficial roses and honey for tea ) in ' Grantchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( white plates ringed with blue lines and the rough male kiss of blankets ) in ' The Great Lover ' . The whimsical tendency is contained , the technical promise considerable . // Another young soldier who became a legend at his death was Julian Grenfell ( 1888 ? 1915 ) . His poem , Into Battle ' ( ' The naked earth is warm with spring ' ) , was published in The Times when he fell . It speaks nobly of the fighting man 's calling , his zest and his readiness in the face of destiny . This , and Brooke 's sonnet , and Laurence Binyon 's ( 1869 ? 1943 ) For the Fallen ' ( ' They shall grow not old , as we that are left grow old ' ) represent the traditional rhetoric of tribute to heroism . But a different note was sounded as early as 1915 by Charles I lamilton Sorley who had once acclaimed young life as delightedly as Brooke in The Song of the Ungirt Runners ' , but who now wrote of the millions of mouthless dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men have said . ' This was to be a more characteristic comment of English poetry on the slaughter of the trenches . Siegfried Sassoon ( 1886 ? 1967 ) saw to that . Sassoon 's prose works , Memoirs of a Fox-Hunting Man ( 1928 ) and Memoirs of an infantry Officer ( 1930 ) reveal the well-to-do background of culture and sportsmanship from which Sassoon was pitchforked into the trenches . His reaction was to pitchfork the true vocabulary , implements and events of trench war into poetry . Sandbags and sludge , mud and blood , trench-boards , sodden buttocks and mats of hair , clotted head and plastering slime ? in Counter Attack ( 1918 ) the reality of war was put in such terms on the printed page . We hear a hearty general 's morning greeting as men go up the line : He 's a cheery old card , ' grunted Harry to JackAs they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack ... . But he did for them both with his plan of attack . The soldier in the middle of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is made more tolerable by a grim humour that distances interminable discomfort ironically . Hear a soldier greeting the dawn after a night on guard duty in the rain ( ' Stand To : Good Friday Morning ' ) : O Jesus , send me a wound today And I 'll believe in Your bread and wine , And get my bloody old sins washed white . There is comparable frankness in the scenes from the front painted by Isaac Rosenberg ( 1890 ? 1918 ) ; wheels lurching over sprawled dead and crunching their bones ( Dead Man 's Dump ' ) , dark air // spurting with fire , a man 's brains splattered on a stretcher-bearer 's face . And , by contrast , there is a sudden incongruous moment of joy when the song of a lark drops from the sky instead of bombs ( ' Returning we hear the larks ' ) . In 1917 Sassoon was wounded and sent home . ( His attempt to get himself court-martialled as a pacifist unwilling to fight on was unsuccessful . ) Another wounded poet , Wilfred Owen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same hospital and he sought Sassoon 's company and advice . Both were to return to the front , Sassoon to survive , Owen to be killed a week before the Armistice . His Dulce et decorum est ' directly attacks the lie ' that it is fine to die for one 's country , by picturing how a soldier dies when a gas attack overtakes men struggling back from the front line ? bent double , like old beggars under sacks ' , some with boots lost limping bloodshod . One man fails to get his gas mask on in time . We see him guttering , choking ' , then flung in a wagon , white eyes writhing , blood gurgling up from froth-corrupted lungs ' at every jolt . I am not concerned with poetry , ' Owen wrote , My subject is War , and the pity of War . The Poetry is in the pity . ' But his poetic gifts were distinctive . The contrast presented in Greater Love ' between sexual love and the soldier 's sacrifice is sharp and profound . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stained stones kissed by the English dead ' . Your slender attitude Trembles not exquisite like limbs knife-skewed . Full warm-heartedness is seen in the hot , large hearts made great with shot ' . This imaginative penetration in sustaining correspondences is evident time and time again in his work . In Strange Meeting ' the poet has a visionary encounter with an enemy he has killed and who shares his sense of waste . The use of consonance and half-rhyme is impressive : Courage was mine , and I had mystery , Wisdom was mine , and I had mastery . Sad as it is , Owen 's story is less sad than that of the brilliantly promising young composer and poet Ivor Gurney ( 1890-1937 ) , who was wounded on the Somme , gassed at Passchendaele , then finally discharged with shell-shock ' , and ultimately ended his days in a mental asylum , still writing poems of unaffected directness and often // of searing pathos on his early Gloucestershire days and his experiences of the Western Front . Edmund Blunden ( 1896 ? 1974 ) edited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memoir . Blunden 's powerful prose reminiscences of service , Undertones of War ( 1928 ) , included some poems . His affinities are with those who have observantly and lovingly done justice in verse to the detailed beauty of the country and its life , as well as with those who captured tense and chilling moments of action on the battlefield . Delicately he describes a barn with its rain-sunken roof and its smell of apples stored in hay , or a pike in a pool quiveringly poised for slaughter ( ' The Barn ' and The Pike ' ) . These , and such gently etched exercises in fastidious pastoralism as Forefathers ' and Almswomen ' , betray a consistent refinement of sensibility and technique . Blunden 's delicacy is the delicacy of a strong mind at work with a disciplined pen . It was in 1912 , before the war began , that an anthology of contemporary verse , edited by Sir Edward Marsh ( 1872 ? 1953 ) and called Georgian Poetry , was published and sold well . Four further volumes were published during the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been applied to the contributors , though sometimes there has been a tendency to use the term pejoratively of the residue that remain when the poets of distinction have been creamed off . Thus smooth versification which lacks imaginative sturdiness and verbal intensity has coloured overmuch our concept of the Georgian ' . Lascelles Abercrombie ( 1881 ? 1938 ) cultivated avein of flaccid eloquence and Wilfrid Wilson Gibson ( 1878 ? 1962 ) , a vein of transparent simplicity . A movement which had initially sought emotional directness and verbal accessibility while fastening on homely subjects readily susceptible to poetic ' treatment gathered on its peripheries numerous versifiers who wrestled neither with words nor experience but took well-trodden metrical and verbal paths towards mellifluousness and charm . Yet Harold Monro ( 1879 ? 1932 ) , whose Poetry Bookshop published the first volume of Georgian Poetry , was a man of wide taste whose own best poems have rare firmness and honesty . A characteristic Georgian voice is that of W. H. Davies ( 1871 ? 1940 ) , a master of transparency . An air of spontaneity surrounds his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An engaging freshness makes for memorability in Leisure ' : // Listeners ' a Traveller knocks on a moonlit door and calls , Is anyone there ? ' , to receive no reply , and to shout , Tell them I came . . . That I kept my word ' , before riding away into silence . That is all . But a tremulous awareness is evoked of meaning undisclosed and momentous , of strange happenings and stranger beings . The technique depends on negatives as well as positives , on what is not said and on what is not denied . No one comes down to the Traveller . No one leans out . No one stirs . It depends too on the clarity of the images ? a bird flying up out of a turret , the horse champing in the quiet , its hoofs finally plunging into silence . De la Mare 's poetry is poetry of events and experiences uninterpreted . He is much concerned with what is not understandable , not known : Oh , no man knows Through what wild centuries Roves back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is concerned with what is not cleared up , not finished ( He said no more that sailor man ...

His mode of expression functions like the character of Martha who used to tell us her stories / In the hazel glen ' : Her voice and her narrow chin , Her grave small lovely head , Seemed half the meaning Of the words she said . ( ' Martha ' ) D. H. Lawrence ( 1885 ? 1930 ) is a poet of different breed . There is no lack of opinionated assertion in poems that begin There is no point in work / unless it absorbs you ' ( Work ' ) or How beastly the bourgeois is ' . The much valued immediacy of impact , whether it be a proposition or an experience of the natural world that is laid before you , precludes all holding back . Lawrence strives for the fullest disclosure . In doing so he moves from stanzaic verse to free verse , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression in his service in recapturing the full sensuous and emotional flavour of an encounter with a snake , a humming-bird or a mountain lion ( ' Snake ' , Humming-Bird ' , Mountain Lion ' ) , in reproducing what is stirred // in thought and mood by the sight of gentians in a house or by the bite of a mosquito ( Bavarian Gentians ' and The Mosquito ' ) . Among other writers horn in the 1880s and 1890s were the Sitwells ? Edith ( 1887 ? 1964 ) , her brother Osbert ( 1892 ? 1969 ) , who wrote a lively five-volume autobiography , beginning with Left Hand ! Right Hand ! ( 1944 ) , and her brother Sacheverell ( 1897 ? ) , prolific in both verse and prose . Edith was a poet of cultivated technical sensitivity whose total output tells a story of development through tour distinct phases of poethood . She began by outraging sobriety and decorum with the flashily adventurous verbal pyrotechnics of Facade ( 1922 ) . Then she moved to romantic evocation of a transfigured childhood world in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the stuff of fairy tale . In her third phase she produced her Waste Land ' , Gold Coast Customs ( 1929 ) , a poem which surveyed the inter-war London scene of slum squalor and society parties in terms of the savage combination of bloodshed and orgy in the African jungle . And in phase four , now a Roman Catholic , she became a prophetic commentator on the human scene during and after the Second World War . The celebrated poem Still Falls the Rain ' parallels the incendiary downpour of a London air-raid with the saving rain of blood from the cross . Robert Graves ( 1895 ? ) made himself known to a huge reading public by his fictional reconstructions of first-century Roman history in I Claudius ( 1934 ) and Claudius the God ( 1934 ) . Graves 's poetry is carefully structured rumination . There is no sense of a cultured past ( as in Eliot ) or of mysteries half glimpsed ( as in De la Mare ) . Indeed t here seems to be a conscious depreciation of anything that might add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience ( ' To evoke posterity / Is to weep on your own grave ' ) . The poetic voice of Edwin Muir ( 1887 ? 1959 ) is more prophetic and evocative . Muir came of an Orkney farming family which was driven by poverty to Glasgow when he was 14 . Scarred by bereavements and privation , he produced a series of volumes such as The Narrow Place ( 1943 ) , The Voyage ( 1946 ) and The Labyrinth ( 1949 ) in which he expressed his own experience of loss and exile by recourse to archetypal imagery of Christian revelation and classical myth . The poetic imagination transfigures the mystery of his personal pilgrimage in parable . A fellow Scotsman of more tranquil temperament , Andrew Young ( 1885 ? 1973 ) , a naturalist and eventually a canon of // Chichester Cathedral , was a poet who could compress acutely observed impressions of the natural world into concise and thoughtful lines , often strong in sustained metaphorical elaboration , as is the picture of the crab ( ' The Dead Crab ' ) with its well-knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in stiletto points ' : I can not think this creature died By storm or fish or sea-fowl harmed Walking the sea so heavily armed ; Or does it make for death to be Oneself a living armoury ? A third Scot , Hugh MacDiarmid ( properly C. M. Grieve ) ( 1892-1978 ) , was a more volcanic spirit than either . A man who hated England and much of what passes for Scotland ' in the minds of readers and tourists , he embraced communism and Scottish nationalism , and looked for a Celtic revolution against English economic and cultural tyranny . MacDiarmid 's use of a specially doctored Scottish vernacular , crucially different from Burns 's in Scottish eyes , but less obviously so to the Sassenach , makes it difficult for English readers to get the natural feel of what is no doubt some of his best work . But MacDiarmid used standard English too . In his later work he is explosively discursive , especially when he lets fly at what he hates . The lash of his tongue is scathing . It was Thomas Stearns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most astonishing literary revolution of the age . The publication of Prufrock and Other Observations ( 1917 ) , Poems ( 1919 ) and The Waste Land ( 1922 ) gave a totally new direction to English poetry . Eliot broke decisively with the conventionalized poeticism of the Georgians , with their preference for ready-made beauty ' in topic and vocabulary , with their evasion in subject matter of the stuff of contemporary urban life in its prosaic , vulgar and squalid aspects . Indeed he found in living current usage the verbal vehicle for fixing with uncanny precision the worried mind 's response to a world of tea cups and coffee spoons and white arms in the lamplight on the one hand , and a world of hair in paper curlers and yellow-soled feet clasped in dirty hands on the other . It is also the world of guttering street lamps , of yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window panes ' , of the smell of steak in passageways ' , of girls who fornicate in tenement flats , or on Margate sands , or in punts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter about aborting pills in London pubs . Eliot put contemporary London life and scenery squarely before his readers : Smells of chestnuts in the streets , And female smells in shuttered rooms , And cigarettes in corridors And cocktail smells in bars . ( ' Rhapsody on a Windy Night ' ) I Ie found the appropriate images and cadences for toning up his presentation to the maximum in terms of verbal force and impact by using the devices of seventeenth-century Metaphysical poetry alongside those of his own age . And he was judicious in having recourse to the remains of a rich literary inheritance that are part of the mental furniture of educated modern man . Eliot brilliantly exploited the striking power of recourse to the past ( ' Sweet Thames , run softly till I end my song ' ) whether for sheer illumination of the present , for violent contrast with it , or for ironic commentary upon it . If Eliot is the greatest English poet of his age it is not just because he fashioned a distinctive and individual utterance to be at his service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , but because he employed it to produce masterpieces . Eliot , like Beckett , is postJoycean . The enrichment of meaning by amplification , overtone and frequent cross-reference is pushed to an extreme stage in Joyce 's Ulysses . We have spoken of Beckett 's reaction against Joycean abundance . Eliot 's reaction was not to strip down the imagery of life to bare equations ( ' Let immersion in a sand-dune equal human impotence ' ) , but to preserve amplification alongside economy by condensing the verbal machinery of amplification . Joyce gradually builds up a series of correspondences to establish parallels between Stephen Dedalus and Hamlet ( Ulysses ) . Eliot makes use of key phrases ( ' Those are pearls that were his eyes ' and The chair she sat in , like a burnished throne ... ' , The Waste Land , And faded on the blowing of the horn ' , Little Gidding ' ) to echo unforgettable moments crucial to the ramatic patterns of The Tempest , Antony and Cleopatra and Hamlet respectively . Such a practice of allusiveness enables a hundred lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in five or ten times that number . And of course the allusiveness is exploited much more briefly and intensively than in the above quotations . Moreover // double allusiveness can complicate the practice , adding multiple dimensions to connotation . Eliot 's multidimensionalism is based partly on internal , partly on external cross-reference . Internally the poet uses , say , the word rock ' repeatedly to carry the religious connotation of Christ or the Church ( The Rock ) . Then usages of the word elsewhere , ostensibly in natural description or arid incantation ( ' The Dry Salvages ' or The Waste Land , v ) , may sound overtones from outside the particular context to add connotative enrichment . Multidimensionalism based on external cross-reference is perhaps a more difficult matter to pin down . We may cite a single instance of the difficulty . In The Fire Sermon ' ( The Waste Land ) , the fire we pray to be plucked from is the fire of lust and greed , the fire of Hell . There is a cold blast at our backs in Hell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is at once macabre and skeletonic and also hints at dancing with bones , as the following image of the grinning face indicates ( The rattle of the bones , and chuckle spread from ear to ear ' ) . Chuckle ' is the giveaway word . One does not see a chuckle ; one hears it . What spreads from ear to ear ( cf. year to year ' , nine lines later ) , as everyone who has sung hymns or psalms knows , is the wind through the cornfield at harvesting ( the harvesting of souls that brings them into Heaven ) ? the wind that Crosses the brown land , unheard ' ( ' unheard ' rings a loud connotative bell in Ash Wednesday and Four Quartets ) but can set the valleys laughing and singing and turn a cornfield into a golden grin . Eliot has strengthened his picture of Hell ( cosy as well as hot ) by the paradox of the cold wind that also carries faint echoes of heavenly music and the garnering of saved souls . Eliot 's work is consummated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and literary memory into a patterned fabric , an epic in miniature ( Four Quartets ) . The work is preceded by a Purgatorio ( Ash Wednesday ) closely related to it in texture and thought . And Ash Wednesday is preceded by early work that has qualities of an Inferno , The Waste Land , to which it may well be that the rest of the early poems act as a commentary or an integrated accompaniment . Eliot 's epigraph to The Waste Land suggests that he was as much interested in the image of the scattered leaves of the Sibyl 's prophecy as he was in the gathered and folded leaves of rose and book and beatific vision at the end of Little Gidding ' . The torn and scattered // leaves are as appropriate to the representation of a dismembered civilization and a dismembered humanity as the flower and the musically patterned poem are to the representation of order recovered and restored . To sort and arrange the torn and scattered fragments is the reader 's task ? parallel to his real-life duty to recover and restore our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest of our literary critics . The precision and authority of his judgements , not only on literature but on wider questions of culture , command attention ; and of course his critical dicta help to illuminate his poetry . ( See The Sacred Wood , 1920 ; After Strange Gods , 1934 ; and Notes towards the Definition of Culture , 1948 . ) ' The American poet Ezra Pound ( 1885 ? 1972 ) , chief exponent of the imagist ' movement that reacted against the sentimental rhetoric and metaphorical imprecision of late Victorian and Edwardian verse , was closely involved with Eliot in the poetic revolution he effected . Pound 's major work , also of epic proportions , Cantos ( 1925 and billowing ) , along with his earlier poetry , is that of a volcanic temperament allied to massive erudition and sharply responsive to the evils of twentieth-century commercialism , injustice and philistinism . Eliot dedicated The Waste Land to Pound as miglior fabbro ' ( the better craftsman ) . The phrase is used by Dante of Arnaut I ) aniel , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , intentionally or otherwise , it parallels Eliot with Dante . Another contemporary whom Eliot praised highly was David Jones ( 1895 ? 1974 ) . In his introduction to Jones 's In Parenthesis ( 1937 ; but the introduction came later ) Eliot speaks of Jones 's affinity ' with Joyce , Pound and himself . Though prose in form , In Parenthesis is poetic in quality . It is an epic of the 1914 ? 18 war , whose literary and historic overtones extend its significance , bringing events into relation with those of Arthurian legend and Roman Britain in which Jones was especially interested . Here again , as Eliot observes , is work whose full dimensions of meaning are yet to be explored . Even more so is this the case with the more taxing work , The Anathernata ( 1952 ) . I lore the use of Welsh and Latin terms and motifs thickens the texture , and the influence of Finnegans Wake is evident in oral rhythm and verbal configuration . Great critical claims have properly been made for Jones 's masterpiece , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // The same can be said of Basil Bunting ( 1900 ? ) , a Northumbrian poet and disciple of Ezra Pound , who made a major impact in his sixties with his autobiographical poem Briggflatts ( 1966 ) . If Bunting makes no concession to the reader who will not work hard , nevertheless his lines have an infectious vitality , and his adoption of the brusque , take-it-or-leave-it stance conveys the assurance of the maestro who can afford to be impatient with mediocrity . The Irish poet Austin Clarke ( 1896 ? 1974 ) also reached his peak in his sixties . He began his career with narrative poems on legendary Irish heroes , spent his middle years in the service of verse drama , and then turned out a series of volumes of verse such as Ancient Lights ( 1955 ) and Flight to Africa ( 1963 ) which grapple forcefully with aspects of contemporary Irish life and do so in an invigoratingly crisp idiom influenced by Gaelic poetry . Clarke 's work is packed with the stuff of life ? vivid portraiture , story and argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowering of Clarke 's poetic maturity had occurred , the rather younger Irish poet Patrick Kavanagh ( 1905 ? 67 ) had already been acclaimed as Yeats 's successor . Kavanagh , son of a cobbler ? farmer from County Monaghan , achieved fame with his long poem The Great Hunger ( 1942 ) , and with two exercises in fictional autobiography , The Green Fool ( 1938 ) and Tarry Flynn ( 1948 ) . Having exchanged the rigours of rural privation for the bars and backchat of Dublin , in his later collections of verse , such as Come Dance with Kitty Stabling ( 1960 ) , Kavanagh reacted with fierce prophetic denunciation against the literary cult of the peasant and the projection of an idealized Ireland . With Kavanagh we have taken leave of poets born in the nineteenth century . We turn to the poets of the thirties ' . Some of them remained just that : but one of them has become a poet of the century , Wystan Hugh Auden ( 1907 ? 73 ) . Eliot , born in St Louis , Missouri , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in York , bred in the Midlands , settled in New York and took United States citizenship . Auden 's early work seemed to put him close to the Marxist camp . He was the poet of unidealized contemporary urbanism , of starving cities , rolling prams , moaning saxophones and talkie-houses , The judge enforcing the obsolete law , The banker making the loan for the war . This world , and the complex metaphysical distress ' it engendered in // his generation , are realized in Look , Stranger ( 1936 ) with striking boldness of rhythm and angularity of idiom . But , like Eliot , Auden became a Christian , and the conversion affected the character of his litter work . His technical versatility and virtuosity are immense : moreover he is irresistibly readable . An engaging fluency takes possession of the reader : it is one half of the secret of Auden 's ompulsion . The other half is his uncanny memorability , a gift of pigrammatic conversationalism that blends the casual and the ontrived , the vulgar and the literary , in juxtapositions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style ' rhaps reflects the Christian paradoxes of sin and salvation , nature nd grace , worldly ephemerality and sacramental significance , in hich theology has immersed Auden 's thought , and experience oulded his sensitivities . The deep currents of his thought and xperience flow under cover ; while the speaking voice is given to otional and spiritual understatement . Auden 's output was vast and rious , from Look , Stranger and The Ascent of F6 ( a drama written in coIlaboration with Christopher Isherwood ) , through New Year Letter 1941 ) , For the Time Being ( 1945 ) and The Age of Anxiety ( 1948 ) , to ter volumes such as The Shield of Achilles ( 1955 ) and About the House 966 ) . In poems of direct approach Auden makes you feel that you are in s presence , but not that you know him well . He is not remarkable r self-revelation , or for transference on to paper of what is sharply It in human relationships ; but his voice is always a poet 's voice , in c with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pression at his disposal . He grapples with a great range of thought uI experience , and grapples in parallel with the resources of utterance . But Auden rejects the prophet 's stance : he does not instruct ; and he does not buttonhole the reader . The take-it-or-leave-it air does not betoken a lack of concern but a healthy sense of proportion . The reader sometimes finds himself eavesdropping as a modest practitioner thinks aloud : After all , it 's rather a privilege amid the affluent traffic to serve this unpopular art which can not be turned into background noise for study or hung as a status trophy by rising executives . . . . ( ' The Cave of Making ' , About the House ) // So Auden writes in the memorial verses to Louis MacNeice ( 1907 ? 63 ) , one of the poets loosely grouped with him as spokesmen for the young in the uneasy 1930s . MacNeice 's conversational style is 1 looser and easier than Auden 's , the texture more fluid , the tone more lyrical . His facility is winningly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapses sometimes into versified reportage , it does not try to disguise its banality : Frivolous , always in a hurry , forgetting the address , Frowning too often , taking enormous notice Of hats and backchat ? how could I assess The thing that makes you different ? This is Autumn journal ( 1939 ) and one can defend a journal for being journalistic . The evocative , nostalgic appeal of its account of the autumn of 1938 for those who lived through it is undeniable . MacNeice has no political axe to grind : he is not at loggerheads with the world he reports on . He observes and ruminates like a verseessayist . There is something of the scholar in his detachment , muc of the Irishman in his melancholy and in his comic irony . MacNeice came from Belfast , and Cecil Day Lewis ( 1904 ? 72 came from Ballingtogher . Lewis shared the social disenchantment of love sequence From Feathers to Iron ( 193 I ) particularly memorable . I Do not expect again the phoenix hour ' , celebrating conception , an Come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , a cry of delight birth ( ' Take a whole holiday in honour of this ! ' ) , Lewis 's lucidity an imaginative inventiveness are charmingly blended . His strident revolutionary vein , however , now sounds crude : indeed his early wo has been criticized for its immaturity , his later work for its lack intensity . There is a ceiling to his verbal awareness , and it is below t level at which precise connotative illumination can astonish a excite . A useful impression of the poetic situation in the 1930s c be gained from World Within World ( 1951 ) by Stephen Spend ( 1909 ? ) . Spender , who more than any of the group has been life-long propagandist for progressive social causes , neverthele emerges in his poetry as a reflective lyrist , musing and brooding the human victims of civilization and the problem of being ( see Edge of Being , 1949 ) . Two South African born poets of the sa // generation , Roy Campbell ( 1901 ? 57 ) and William Plomer ( 1903 ? 73 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Campbell 's politics , however , were of the Right ( he fought for Franco in Spain ) . He is a poet with a vigorous voice , prodigal of word and image , a South African Hemingway in some of his postures , and given to satire . In this last respect he matches Plomer , but Plomer 's satire is comic and explores the absurdity of the human scene . Meet the heroine of Mews Flat Mona , A Memory of the Twenties ' . On a sofa upholstered in human skin Mona did researches in original sin , and so on . Finally , hooked on the hard stuff , she stepped from the top of an Oxford Street store , falling like a bomb on an elderly curate : When they came with a shovel to shift her remains They found a big heart but no vestige of brains . Among poets of the same age group as the poets of the 1930s are two women , Kathleen Raine ( 1908 ? ) and Stevie Smith ( 1902 ? 71 ) , who present an interesting contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first of a number of collections by a woman with both a scientific training and an interest in mysticism , whose intimate , meditative verse has a rare lyrical refinement , and who voices her spiritual understanding of the natural world in neo-Platonic symbols . Her autobiographical trilogy , Farewell , Happy Fields ( 1973 ) , the Land Unknown ( 1975 ) and The Lion 's Mouth ( 1977 ) , traces her rejection of the de-supernaturalized context of thinking which influenced her generation in their student days . Stevie Smith 's poetry , n the other hand , inhabits that no-man's-land disputed by gravity nd frivolity , sobriety and hilarity . By cultivating the device of sometimes disguising profundity as triviality , logic as nonsense , tevie Smith leaves the reader often disquietingly unsure whether c seemingly banal line is really banal , whether the apparent in-sequitur is perhaps vibrant with new insight . The technique of laying tricks with the devices of doggerel sometimes pays rich dividends . The characteristically bland idiom can be disconcertingly aught with question marks : So in my time I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who do wear smart hats . ( ' Magna est Veritas ' ) Keeping seriousness at arm 's length for a lifetime is a very serious // matter , and for that reason alone Stevie Smith 's work can not lightly be dismissed . It includes three novels as well as Collected Poems ( 1975 ) . William Empson ( 1906 ? ) is an intellectual who has pursued his ideal of maximum verbal concentration beyond the point of maximum demand upon the reader ; John Betjeman ( 1906 ? ) , by contrast , is the master of limpid directness and swinging rhythms that have given him deserved popularity : Miss Joan Hunter Dunn , Miss Joan Hunter Dunn , How mad I am , sad I am , glad that you won . The warm-handled racket is back in its press , But my shock-headed victor , she loves me no less . ( A Subaltern 's Love-song ' ) It is perhaps not surprising that when his Collected Poems ( 1958 ) ' came out the volume achieved record sales . More than any other contemporary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with lambent clarity . It ranges over a wide variety of likes and dislikes proper to a sensitive personality in love with Victorianism , fascinated by people and keenly nostalgic for the private and public pasta Summoned by Bells ( 1960 ) , his autobiographical poem , is a lively record of his early days . Betjeman became poet laureate in 1972 . There was a trio of poets born in the second decade of the century for whom neither the lucidity of Betjeman nor the social concern of the 1930s ' poets had any attractions . David Gascoyne ( 1916 ? ) was early known for the garish extravagance of surrealistic image exploited in expressing the anguish of desolation and menace kno in the bohemian circles of the 1930s . But a different note was hear in the moving poem on the suicide of a friend in 1941 ( ' An Elegy and Gascoyne 's gifts were subjected to the discipline of an awakene religious awareness . His Christ in Ecce Homo ' is one who wee over Jerusalem and over the bombed cities of Europe . Gascov brings wit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One his anthologized poems , ' The Sacred Hearth ' , is addressed to fellow neo-Romantic poet , George Barker ( 1913 ? ) . Barker ' poetry has always aroused controversy . It is a torrent of words which every trick of the verbal conjuror is skilfully played . There is indiscriminate extravagance in the use of technical and metaphoric devices and in the juxtaposition of incongruous tones of voice . For // hat , the impact is undeniable : there is plenty of fine writing , and the welter , notably perhaps in Eros in Dogma ( 1944 ) and The True t ; onfssions of George Barker , can be irresistible . While his longer-lived contemporaries steadily developed their gifts , the third of the neo-Romantic visionaries , Dylan Thomas ( 1914 ? 53 ) , rose rapidly to fame , his genius blazed , and he died at 39 . The flamboyant character of his gifts and his personality , the ostensibly fatalistic addiction to alcohol and the resultant untimely death kit behind a legend of artistic self-immolation . Thomas 's Portrait of the Artist as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a poet whose childhood and youth in South Wales left him with an intensely aware zest for its life and its scenery . His first volume of poems , Eighteen Poems , came out in 1934 . His reputation was widely established by the time Deaths and Entrances was published in 1946 . The radio play Under Milk Wood ( 1954 ) , which gives an animated impressionistic projection of a day in the life of a Welsh seaside village , is rich in comic human cartoonery . It extended Thomas 's public appreciably . Thomas 's tumultuous verse is laden with rhetorical imagery of great suggestive force , and it voices a visionary sense of the wonderful as he pounds away at the basic experiences of life and death . Syntax and logic are displaced by interwoven music and metaphor , and the complex verbal patterns , with their extraordinary rhythmic force and resounding Celtic superabundance , inevitably recall both Hopkins nd Joyce . Whether Thomas 's inner intellectual core justifies the firmer affinity or his inner artistic discipline justifies the latter is a uestion which evokes controversy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiated . But Thomas 's poetic persona stamped itself on our age with lines and verses that impulsively convey the urgency of man 's need and of his faith amid c elemental confrontations of life in time . One might cite A refusal to Mourn the Death , by Fire , of a Child in London ' ( a at-time elegy ) , And death shall have no dominion ' or Do not go gentle into that good night ' ( written on the death of his father ) . Dvlan 's namesake , R. S. Thomas ( 1913 ? ) , a fellow Welshman of very different breed , has spent his life as a parish priest in parishes rural Wales , where ministering to hill farmers and villagers has ought him close to the harsher realities of country life ? the dirt , the city and the near bestiality . Thomas 's great literary strength lies in // his economy , his sturdiness , his total evasion of sentimentality and his powerful sense of paradox . His unromantic studies of rural life are the work of a man deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he writes about . Human studies such as that of Iago Prytherch ( A Peasant ' ) make no concessions to sentimentality . Thomas accepts the frightening vacancy of his mind ' yet recognizes him as a prototype of human endurance . Thomas 's concern with the dual power of nature to brutalize and to heal is rooted in his awareness of the openness of man 's nature to the bestial and the spiritual . If the men of the moors have not yet shaken the moss ' from their savage skulls or prayed the peat from their eyes ' ( A Priest to His People ' ) , nevertheless men of the farm survey a girl evacuee with earth 's charity , patient and strong ' ( ' The Evacuee ' ) . A religious awareness of the cost of healing and creativity , natural and spiritual , in the life of earth and the life of man , asserts a powerful consistency . There is evident tension of heart and mind behind Thomas 's frank confrontation with the paradox of the repellent harshness and saving simplicity of the peasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and terseness the personal tensions of his priestly life , exposing the varying moods of bewilderment and testing that are provoked by the stark contrast between inclination and vocation , between what seems to make sense in earthly terms and the calling he has embraced . Thomas 's collections include Song at the Year 's Turning ( 1955 ) , Poetry for Supper ( 1958 ) , The Bread of Truth ( 1963 ) , Pieta ( 1966 ) , Laboratories of the Spirit ( 1975 ) and Between Here and , Now ( 1982 ) . It is understandable that he has been called the greates living English poet . Something of Thomas 's capacity to universalize the local and th. parochial is found in the poetry of Norman Nicholson ( 1914 ? ) wh has resolutely spent virtually the whole of his life living in the sma terrace house in which he was reared behind his father 's shop Millom , Cumbria . Rooted in an oddly blended rural yet urban area he is sensitive to both aspects of his environment , writing with equal resonant descriptive accuracy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1981 ) , but also of the mining area of Cleator Moor ' ( Fiv Rivers , 1944 ) and the towers of Windscale ' ( A Local Habitation 1975 ) . His technique of mining loaded resonances from everyday par ticularities is applied increasingly to human characters and their say ings as well as to the physical environment . His Selected Poems ( 1982 // evoked from Seamus Heaney the comment that Nicholson 's diction and images realise the texture and pieties of a whole way of life ' . Although the Second World War did not produce a body of war poetry ' on a scale to match that of First World War poets , there was a small knot of young men who were maturing into poethood when war seized them and killed them . Sidney Keyes ( 1922-43 ) , killed in North Africa , left two volumes of verse , The Iron Laurel ( 1942 ) and /he Cruel Solstice ( 1944 ) , in which the soldier 's consciousness of pain and of the menace of death seems to be symptomatic of the wider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed in Burma , brilliantly captured the frustration and tedium of service life for the uniformed civilian by picturing a wet Sunday in a bell-tent in All Day It Has Rained ' ( Raider 's Damn , 1942 ) . For Keith Douglas ( 1920-44 ) , killed in Normandy , the horrors of battle and the premonition of death gave focus to a dispassionate ruthlessness in scraping down to the bare hones of the human condition and in disinfecting his style of all false finery . The Collected Poems ( 1951 , revised 1966 ) show him to be the one poet of his group in whose case comparisons with Wilfred Owen would not be out of place . Of servicemen poets who survived the war to continue writing , Roy Fuller ( 1912 ? ) recorded the facts of service life with sardonic lucidity ( TheMiddle ofa War , 1942 ) , and in some dozen volumes since has brought a low-key detachment to bear on the dissatisfactions of the human lot , and done so with a consistent technical discipline that commands respect even where it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) , who served in the Royal Navy , has managed to produce ballad-style poems of Kiplingesque verve and swing without faltering into cheapness : I walked where in their talking graves And shirts of earth five thousand lay , When history with ten feasts of fire Had eaten the red air away . ( ' At the British War Cemetery , Bayeux ' ) Vernon Scannell ( 1922 ? ) produced his most celebrated war poem , the title poem of Walking Wounded ( 1965 ) , many years after his active service . It muses wryly on a procession of damaged men who have lrtissed the heroic ' glamour of grave disfigurement or death and will have to fight again , and whose situation thus matches more closely // the common human lot of most of us than do the mighty achievements of the few . An equally celebrated war poem is Soldiers Bathing ' by F. T. Prince ( 1912 ? ) , the meditation of a richly stocked mind sensitive to the deeper historical and religious implications of man 's involvement with bloodshed . Prince was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modern Poets 20 , and Heath-Stubbs too is a versatile craftsman whose erudition matches his wit . He has something of Auden 's skill in moulding conversational idiom into verse . Among the numerous poets of this same generation is a group of Scotsmen . Norman MacCaig ( 1912 ? ) has a rare capacity for detecting the extraordinary quality of what is ordinary and for pinning the observed revelation down in telling imagery . Under the thatched roof of a barn , where mice squeak small hosannahs all night long ' , kittens below are tawny brooches ; Splayed on the chests of drunken sacks ' ( Byre ' , A Round ofApplause , 1962 ) . W. S. Graham ( 1918 ? ) is a poet whose integrity of self-scrutiny shines through overwhelmingly intense imagery ( as in the title poem of Nightfishing , 1955 ) , yet whose struggle to communicate can sometimes leave the reader at a loss . George Mackay Brown ( 1921 ? ) is an Orcadian who has settled in his home island to fasten in poetry ( see Selected Poems , 1977 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local people and their way of life . He shares with R. S. Thomas the fearless accuracy that never either cartoonifies or diminishes its object ; but the cultural ambience is richer than Thomas 's , for he threads imagery of the primitive and mythic past through his presentation . Edwin Morgan ( 1920 ? ) has registered aspects of day-to-day Glasgow life with imaginative ingenuity . An inventive and sometimes exuberant poet , he has no truck with modish cold-bloodedness . ( See Poems o ' Thirty Years , 1982 . ) Iain Crichton Smith ( 1928 ? ) sketches th Scottish background deftly and portrays Scots people with a rathe melancholy awareness of human vulnerability . ( See Selected Poem 1955 ? 1980 , 1982 . ) Alongside these Scots poets who used English are several who preferred to use Scots and who soaked themselves in the Scottis literary tradition . Sydney Goodsir Smith ( 1915 ? 75 ) wrote a finsequence of meditative elegies on great lovers of history and myth Under the Eildon Tree ( 1948 ) . Tom Scott ( 1918 ? ) , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long allegoric. // study of civilizational collapse , based on the sinking of the Titanic , in the title poem of The Ship and Ither Poems ( 1963 ) , and he edited The Penguin Book of Scottish Verse ( 1970 ) . Robert Garioch ( 1909 ? 81 ) has an entertaining vein of jaunty raciness in the liveliest tradition of Scottish satire . Equally boisterous and heady is the Scots poetry of Alexander Scott ( 1920 ? ) , a hectoring , muscular and often rumbustiously comic commentator on his times . ( See Selected Poems 1943-1974 , 1975 . ) A turning-point in the literary history of our century was reached in 1956 when Robert Conquest ( 1917 ? ) edited New Lines , an anthology which gave visible shape to the reaction against the nco-Romanticism of Dylan Thomas and his like . The label the Movement ' was applied to the contributors to Conquest 's anthology , but it would be unjust to blur the individualities of the poets involved by subsuming their efforts under a common banner . The antiRomantic movement eschewed rhetorical extravagances , prophetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the cynical spirit are both anti-Romantic . The poets of the so-called Movement ' are a mixed bunch . Philip Larkin ( 1922 ? ) was acknowledged as the leader of the group . His volumes include The Less Deceived ( 1955 ) , The Whitsun Weddings ( 1964 ) and High Windows ( 1974 ) . He sees himself as writing in the tradition of Thomas Hardy in refusing to don the mantle of self-conscious poethood , but fastening without pretension on the commonplace experience , pin-pointing its impact on the senses and hinting at its half-glimpsed meaning ? or more often its fully glimpsed meaninglessness ? for modern man . The feeling recurs that man has lost his footing amid natural and civilizational instabilities . In ' Ambulances ' children and women in the street are stopped in their tracks at the sight of A wild white face that overtops Red stretcher-blankets momently and sense the solving emptiness / That lies just under all we do ' . The sense of solving emptiness ' is not far removed from cynical disentgagement . Scorn of gravity and pretension can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of comprehensiveness can turn into linkered obsession with the limitedly parochial . But Larkin is a ighly skilled craftsman . // The cultivation of a casual tone that seems to say I 'm not a poet ' was tried by several Movement ' poets . When juxtaposed with self-consciously literary ' utterance , the conversational throwaway can be powerful in effect . Kingsley Amis 's ( 1922 ? ) A Bookshop Idyll ' illustrates the point : Man 's love is of man 's life a thing apart ; Girls are n't like that . D. J. Enright ( 1920 ? ) adopted the off-hand stance and low-key idiom to catch the modish air of sincerity ' in Bread Rather Than Blossoms ( 1956 ) . While Larkin edited The Oxford Book of TwentiethCentury Verse ( 1973 ) , Enright edited The Oxford Book of Contemporary Verse 1945 ? 1980 ( 1980 ) so that Movement ' biases towards cheerful balladry and versified chat have become institutionalized . Enright 's anthology , for instance , is generous in provision of space for the entertainingly witty and polished light verse of Gavin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird and Locrian Arsinoe . I want to arrange a protest in high places . I just want to say to a few fat-nippled goddesses : It is n't fair . ( ' From V. C. a Gentleman of Verona ' ) There is space too , more properly so , for poems by Patricia Beer ( 1924 ? ) who shares Larkin 's rejection of conviction and fights shy of posture and of gravity alike : We come across Two slight acquaintances from NW3 Nuzzling at a Bellini . ( ' Birthday Poem from Venice ' , Selected Poems , 1980 ) Of New Lines poets not yet mentioned , Elizabeth Jennings ( 1926 ? ) cultivated a limpid clarity , shaping her sentences in neat counterpoint with conventional metrical design . ( See A Way of Looking , 1955 , and A Sense of the World , 1957 . ) The Movement ' label was tagged on to New Lines poets at an early age . Many of them have continued to be productive in a way which makes the tag anachronistic . Donald Davie ( 1922 ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted by Movement ' poets . Though not himself a poet who speaks with the // voice of passion , Davie is a master of that kind of annotation which fixes momentary reflections and experiences with winning precision and with studied artistry , as his Collected Poems 1950 ? 1970 ( 1972 ) shows . Another verse-annotator , Dannie Abse ( 1923 ? ) , has documented the stuff of life with a sense of humour , with companionable candour and with an eye for the quirkiness of the commonplace . He seems to have encountered in his travels someone who contrasted his humdrum interests unfavorably with the concerns of more celebrated contemporaries , such as Geoffrey Hill and Ted Hughes : Not one poem about an animal , she said .. . Your contemporaries have all composed inspired elegies for expired beasts ; told of salmon flinging themselves up the sheer waterfall ; cold crows , in black rages , loitering near motorways . ( Florida ' , Collected Poems , 1977 ) James Kirkup ( 1923 ? ) early compelled attention with the title poem of A Correct Compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the operating theatre , and has since proved a fluent if sometimes facile versifier of whatever seizes his attention or interest . By contrast Charles Tomlinson 's ( 1927 ? ) gift for verbally fixing the particular moment with both intensity and precision is the product of disciplined application to his craft . Tomlinson gives Ireshness to the world he delineates , and no poetic persona intrudes on its unveiling . ( See Selected Poems 1951 ? 74 , 1978 . ) It was a poet born in the 1930s , Ted Hughes ( 1930 ? ) , who first w on acclaim for his thoroughness in rejecting the urbane civilities of ' Movement ' verse . He injected a shot of percussive aggressiveness into the body poetic , turning to the animal world to tap its resources of raw energy and brutality , and using for backcloths the harsh moors and crags of his native West Yorkshire . I sit in the top of the wood , my eyes closed . In action , no falsifying dream Between my hooked head and hooked feet : Or in sleep rehearse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Hawk in the Rain , 1957 ) // Hughes has been a productive poet . In several collections he has featured Crow ' ( e.g. Crow , 1970 ; Crow Wakes , 1971 ) , utilizing him , on the model of the North American mythological trickster , Raven , as a spokesbird against God in surveying the black comedy of the universe . A more economic and disciplined poet , Geoffrey Hill ( 1932 ? ) , has shown that dissatisfaction with the narrowness and banality of much Movement and post-Movement verse can be answered by steady confrontation with the facts of love and death , of faith and suffering , which does not hanker after Lawrentian primitivism and does not cut off the present from the past . Hill is a scholarly poet whose wide-ranging allusiveness , historical and literary , may limit his appeal , but he has been called the outstanding poet of his generation ' , and the claim may be tested by reference to the richly textured poem The Mystery of the Charity of Charles Peguy ( 1983 ) , to the grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ( KingLog , 1968 ) , or to the disturbing account of creation in the early work Genesis ' ( For the Unfallen , 1959 ) , which pictures the vigorous thrust of new life in dynamic imagery : And where the streams were salt and full The tough pig-headed salmon strove , Curbing the ebb and the tide 's pull , To reach the steady hills above . Perhaps scholarship is in fashion again . Certainly another dominant poetic voice of the past two decades has been that of Anthony Thwaite ( 1930 ? ) , who ranges widely in substance and whose technical expertise has matching flexibility . Mr Cooper ' ( The Owl in the Tree , 1963 ) presents an unexpected encounter with the riddle of death in the urinal of a Manchester pub , while New Confessions ( 1974 ) meditates on Saint Augustine , and Victorian Voices ( 1980 ) is a collection of dramatic monologues by nineteenth-century characters . Jon Stallworthy ( 1935 ? ) made a big impact with the poem The Almond Tree ' ( Root and Branch , 1969 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of learning in the hospital corridor that his new-born son had Down 's syndrome . Successive volumes have confirmed his status as a concerned writer and meticulous craftsman . Alan Brownjohn ( 1931 ? ) takes stock exactly , if uneasily and ironically , of the human scene around him ( see A Night in the Gazebo , // 1980 ) . Peter Scupham ( 1933 ? ) , no mere annotator of the immediate environment , has brought awareness of history and of human mortality to bear on poetic exercises laden with thought ( see The Hinterland , 1977 ) . Tony Harrison ( 1937 ? ) , translator and librettist , born in Leeds but currently working for the New York Metropolitan Opera , has published poems on his Leeds home background ( in The Loiners , 1970 ; and Continuous , 1982 ) which are as subtle as they are earthy , and which , in the later volume at least , seem to confirm his voice as that of someone more than a minor poet . A notable feature of the past two decades has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older ones Richard Murphy ( 1927 ? ) , from County Galway , has made sustained and percipient studies of Irish personalities and has recorded the changes and chances of the seaman 's lot . ( See The Last Galway Hooker , 1961 ; and New and Selected Poems , 1974 . ) Thomas Kinsella ( 1928 ? ) left Ireland for the United States in 1965 . Strenuous cerebralism gives his work a density that too often sacrifices surface coherence . John Montague ( 1929 ? ) moved in the opposite direction , from the United States to Ireland . He is a sharp observer of life with a keen sense of the past , and he edited The Faber Book of Irish Verse ( 1974 ) . Selected Poems ( 1982 ) at times reflects his worried absorption with his Ulster inheritance . And it is this inheritance which is so powerfully explored in the poetry of Seamus Heaney ( 1939 ? ) , whose emigration has been from County Down to the Republic . In a series of collections ( Death of a Naturalist , 1966 ; Wintering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1979 ) Heaney has moulded his highly charged stanzas from terse phrases and telling images that tingle with resonance . In the nit-quoted poem Digging ' the poet watches his father digging his potato patch as his grandfather dug the peat , and ends with the inspired climax : Between my finger and my thumb The squat pen rests . I 'll dig with it . Ind dig he does , into the landscape and its past history , with a justly acclaimed exactitude and lucidity . Heaney 's contemporary Michael Longley ( 1939 ? ) , from Belfast , knows how to combine traditional metrics with eloquent colloquialism , and has touched movingly on the troubles . Derek Mahon ( 1941 ? ) , also from Belfast , has been // defined by a reviewer as the least locally attached ' of the recent Northern Irish poets , and as working in the post-Movement tradition of the poem as anecdote-and-moral ' . Certainly Mahon gives the impression of a poet who can turn his hand to any subject that presents itself ( see Poems 1962 ? 1978 , 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born in Leeds , was brought up in Belfast and has a deft ironic way of allowing a superficially flat verbal line to throw up overtones of personal anguish or overshadowing violence ( see The Strange Museum , 1980 ) . Paul Muldoon ( 1951 ? ) , from County Armagh , is more taxingly remote and oblique , often teasing the reader with blank inconclusiveness . Yet his command of word and image has the stamp of authority . ( See New Weather , 1973 ; Mules , 1977 ; and Why Brownlee Left , 1980 . ) In turning to Paul Muldoon we have already touched on a poet born in the 1950s . If it is difficult to be just to the writers of one 's own century , it is almost impossible to be just to those of recent decades . It would be invidious and misleading lightly to select for reference a further sample of the poets now writing . The Penguin Book of Contemporary British Poetry ( 1982 ) , edited by Blake Morrison and Andrew Motion , includes selections from seven poets we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas Dunn ( 1942 ? ) , who first made his name for neatly delineated but flatly dispassionate vignettes of the city scene ( Terry Street , 1969 ) but has developed a finer and more assured touch in St Kilda 's Parliament ( 1981 ) ; and James Fenton ( 1949 ? ) , author of The Memory of War : Poems 1968 ? 1982 ( 1982 ) , whose fullness of concrete detail is teasingly and potently conjoined with defiance of simplistic or conclusive interpretation , and whose cadences and idioms sometimes carry subtle overtones in echo of Eliot . By contrast , the voice of Craig Rainc ( 1944 ? ) is par excellence that of an innovator whose fanciful imagery is calculated to revitalize our view of the familiar world : He shakes the air into a paper bag and , eggs pickpocketed inside , trapezes it . ( ' The Grocer ' ) Set alongside the gnomic profundities of James Fenton 's A German Requiem ' ( A German Requiem , 1980 ) , such refreshing ingenuities suggest that in respect of both the reliance upon tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shape . 22 The twentieth-century novel Of the writers who launched themselves about the turn of the century none is more remarkable than Joseph Conrad ( 1857 ? 1924 ) . A Polish orphan , he conceived a passion for the sea , was twenty years a seafarer , and became a British subject and a master-mariner . He settled down on land in 1894 and his first two novels , Almayer 's Folly ( 1895 ) and An Outcast of the Islands ( 1896 ) , have a common Malayan background . But . it is in The Nigger of the Narcissus ' ( 1897 ) and more especially in Lord Jim ( 1900 ) that Conrad 's quality first shows up . He is now master of his adopted language and is able to add to his control of atmosphere and his rather melancholy concern with broken men ( such is Almayer ) a new depth of psychological insight . Lord ' Jim instinctively leaps to join other officers who take to a boat when their ship , laden with pilgrims , appears to be sinking . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a romantic and an idealist : the jump is his ' tall ' ; and his incapacity at the crisis is one version of that impulsive departure from habitual standards which fascinates Conrad . The burden of the almost involuntary cowardice stays with Lord Jim until his life ends in a final expiatory act of redemption . Though Conrad 's experience as a seaman provides the stuff of his novels , and the sea itself ? its changefulness , enmity in storm and reposefulness in calm ? had moulded his spirit , his overriding interest is in human beings , and sea life provides a background and a symbolism for exploring their behaviour and their worth . The worth ' is tested in situations of stress such as life at sea or on the edge of the jungle or among violent men readily provokes . Faithfulness , whether in sudden peril or before an exacting demand or under the corrosive %train of long isolation in remote parts of the world , is what proves men . So Captain MacWhirr ( in Typhoon , 1903 ) rides the storm in the // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger of mutiny . Tom Lingard ( in The Rescue , 1920 ) faces a more ambiguous test . Upper-class people are perilously stranded in their yacht and need his help ( he has fallen in love with one of them ) just at a point when past obligation requires him to be wholly preoccupied with a crisis in the cause of a Malayan prince ; and it is the prince 's cause that suffers . Mr Kurtz ( in Heart ofDarkness , 1902 ) , an ivory-trader in the Congo , succumbs to the strange evils of the jungle and proves a hollow man . Heart of Darkness , like Lord Jim , is one of the stories told by Marlow . Conrad 's ironic power is strengthened by his use of a narrator whose comments distance events and supply an additional point of judgement . The oblique method is needed to contain the intricacies of the psychological and moral investigations Conrad undertakes . Nostromo ( 1904 ) , often regarded as Conrad 's most masterly work , is a vast study of a South American country , Costaguana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pattern of conflicts and mysteries on a philosophical basis whose central symbol is the Gould Concession ' , a silver mine . Charles Gould 's wealth and power have enabled him to prop up a shaky capitalist government , but revolution breaks out . Nostromo , a trusted foreman , conveys silver away under instructions , hides it , and then pretends the vessel carrying it has sunk . Silver is the demonic influence , political and personal , rotting the governing system , the domestic virtues of Gould and the integrity of Nostromo : and of course many others are touched by it in life and personality too . Conrad 's created world is immense ? the republic of Costaguana with its politics , its trade and its teeming personalities . The intricacy of the imaginative presentation is such that every sensitivity of the reader 's poetic and psychological understanding is appealed to . Man clashes with nature , value with value , man with man ; and all public enterprise and private virtue are at war with the corrosive dominion of time . Among novels in which the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its setting in Tsarist Russia . Razumov runs into difficulties when trying to aid a fugitive fellow student who has thrown a bomb and killed a minister in St Petersburg , and he betrays the revolutionary to the police . As so often , Conrad 's central concern is the testing of a man 's soul in crisis , the laying bare of his ultimate resources in lonely confrontation with a perilous question mark . A very different literary career started almost simultaneously with // Conrad 's when H. G. Wells ( 1866 ? 1946 ) published The Time Machine in 1895 , thus beginning a series of prophetic books in what we now call science fiction . The time machine carries its inventor forward to a horrific future of evolutionary regress . In addition to Wellsian fantasies ( The Shape of Things to Come , 1933 , was a later one ) , Wells wrote social novels with a message . In Kipps ( 1905 ) a uung man who works at a draper 's suddenly acquires great wealth , and a good deal of fun ( not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class . Humour and human interest remain predominant , as they are in Tono-Bungay ( 1909 ) and The History of Mr Polly ( 1910 ) , two books which contain autobiographical material . Tono-Bungay ' is the name of a patent medicine , slightly injurious rubbish at one and three halfpence a bottle ' , that makes a fortune by effective sales promotion . Mr Polly is a bankrupt shopkeeper who fails to commit suicide , takes to the road , and settles down with the landlady of a country pub . Ann Veronica ( 1909 ) is a protest novel in which a 21-year-old woman , a biology student , rebels gainst the social , political and sexual inhibitions fettering the young omen of the age . In later novels such as The World of William Clissold 1926 ) fiction becomes increasingly a vehicle for argument . Since ells was the apostle of scientific progress , socialism and emancipation from monogamy , his polemics brought him into conflict with is contemporaries . Among them was G. K. Chesterton ( 1874 ? 1936 ) , whose goodumouredly aggressive Christianity ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientism , humanism and rationalism . His aginative work is impregnated with his beliefs . Love of paradox ti fertility in aphorism mark his inimitable style . The detective ones featuring the shrewd priest , Father Brown , ( eventually coltied in The Father Brown Stories , 1929 ) were immensely popular for cir unpredictability , and , like all else Chesterton wrote , they are diciously laden with wisdom . The Man Who Was Thursday ( 1908 ) his best novel . A tale of anarchists and secret agents that unexpectedly makes a serious point at the end , it excellently exemplifies Chesterton 's brilliance at leading the reader up the garden path . For turning of tables and the rocking of glibly held assumptions is Chesterton 's forte . His poetry keeps its place in the anthologies by tic of his mastery of rousing balladry at once rhythmically sophistocated and rhetorically ablaze ( ' Lepanto ' and The Ballad of the White // Horse especially ) . As a critic GKC is zestful , brimming with ideas , an unapologetic chaser of hares and dispenser of illumination ( see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bernard Shaw , 1909 ) . As a biographer and thinker Chesterton is the kind of popularizer who does not cheapen what he touches , as his St Thomas Aquinas1933 ) and his Orthodoxy ( 1908 ) will show . Chesterton 's friend and fellow Catholic , Hilaire Belloc ( 1870 ? 1953 ) , completes the quadrumvirate ( Shaw , Wells , Chesterton , Belloc ) who challenged settled assumptions , social and economic , though from vastly different angles . The Chesterhelloc ( Shaw 's term ) also challenged the established reading of history in respect of the value of the Reformation and the presupposed continuity of progress . Belloc 's output of satire , travel books , history and polemics was prolific : but the topicality of much of it has dated it , and he is now read chiefly for his light verse . A famous couplet now reads ironically : When I am dead , I hope it may be said : His sins were scarlet , but his books were read . ' On Conrad 's last voyage as First Mate of the Torrens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1867 ? 1933 ) Galsworthy has described how the great teller of tales ' and he spen evening watches together and how Conrad asked him to his cabin o the last evening .

In creating the Forsyte family he found medium for expressing his disturbed awareness of the limitations th. the values of the propertied classes impose on their lives , particular on their finer sensitivities in human relationships . Soames Forsyte arid incompatibility with his wife Irene , who rejects her status as piece of property , represents the failure of beauty to impinge on t world of the possessive . Galsworthy 's thinking is clear and unprete tious , his fictional world honestly and compassionately constructs The three volumes of The Forsyte Saga ( The Man of Property , 191 In Chancery , 1920 , and To Let , 1921 ) were succeeded by further trilogies , A Modern Comedy ( 1929 ) , and The End of the Chap !

They are the children of a draper in Bursley , one of the Five Towns . Bennett 's sense of reality and his understanding of women 's minds give the reader a close familiarity with his people and their world . The book is both a sombre comment on the passage of time and a vindication of the unbending will of Midlands women in confronting it . Of his other novels , Anna of the Five Towns ( 1902 ) and Clayhanger ( 1910 ) , also Potteries novels , have a comparable authenticity . ( The latter , the first of a trilogy , is set in the 1870s and 1880s and takes in the Jubilee of Queen Victoria in 1887 . ) I'he influence of French realism ( Balzac and Flaubert ) lies behind the careful recording of Midlands life . Of later novels Riceyman Steps ( 1923 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study of human eccentricity . Lord Raingo ( 1926 ) , the fruit of Bennett 's wartime work at the Ministry of Information , presses the contrast between the bloodshed at the front and the antics of those involved in Ow power game in Whitehall and Downing Street . It was left to a serving soldier to do full justice to this theme and the larger theme of the historic changes effected by the First World War . Ford Madox Ford ( 1873 ? 1939 ) had collaborated with Conrad on two of Conrad 's earlier works ( The Inheritors , 1901 , and Romance , 1903 ) . A friend of Pound and a champion ofJoyce , Ford was anxious to free the novel from narrative techniques that do violence to the mind 's encounter with life 's disordered impressions , and also to exploit further the technique of oblique reportage , so that reading tan never lead to single-track interpretation that falsifies the character of experience .

He is heavily involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act and response tease our curiosity ; but ere is no guidance from an omniscient author to help us to a cisive judgement on the reliability of his record or the accuracy of s self-revelation . The book is a little masterpiece , and a fit precurr to the four novels together called Parade 's End : Some Do Not 924 ) , No More Parades ( 1925 ) , A Man Could Stand Up ( 1926 ) and t Post ( 1928 ) . They investigate the effect of the First World War English society by tracing the career of one of the gentry Christopher Tietjens ) damaged by it . Tietjens , son of a Yorkshire downer , proud , generous , a gentleman with too little concern for own interests and his own image , is tricked into marriage with a worthless woman . Personal happiness is long in abeyance because of // her machinations and because of his old-fashioned chivalrous reluctance to take advantage of the love of a congenial girl who has brains , ideals and generosity like his own . This quandary complicates the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he leaves the security of the civil service , where he is expected to fake figures , to become an officer at the front , where his decency and integrity are as much an obstacle to his military career as they were to his civil career . The first three books move from pre-war days to the end of hostilities , and the fourth book is in the nature of an epilogue . Characterization is vital ; narrative presentation cunningly counterpoints the inner life with the outer life and the present with the past . Momentous social and psychological changes effected by the war are registered in acutely diagnosed personal predicaments . Another ambitious fictional treatment of the war came from R. 11 . Mottram ( 1883 ? 1971 ) who served in Flanders as an interpreter . He presented the resident peasant 's view of the war alongside that of serving soldiers by fastening upon events at a farm behind the lines that is used as a billeting post .

His war books are the stories of espionage featuring Richard Hannay . In The Thirty-Nine Steps ( 1915 ) Hannay is made aware of a German plot and becomes the quarry of plotters and ( by error ) of police alike : he appears again in Greennrantle ( 1916 ) and Mr Standfast ( 1919 ) , where his angle on the war is that of a major engaged in dangerous missions . Buchan 's view encompasses as a cosmic drama ' what other participants saw only from the inside as a meaningless waste . It is fair to compare Buchan with Stevenson for the liveliness and directness of his narrative technique , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw the war in retrospect . During the years of bloodshed many writers were peacefully at work who had long established themselves and some who were just hoping to find their feet . Among the latter , Katherine Mansfield ( properly Katherine Mansfield Beauchamp , 1880 ? 1923 ) was writing short stories of her native New Zealand , determined to bring the life of her homeland into the consciousness of the old world ( see Bliss , 1920 ) ; while Henry I landel Richardson ( properly Ethel Florence Richardson , 1870 ? 1946 ) from Melbourne published Australia Felix , the first novel in e r trilogy The Fortunes of Richard Mahony , in 1917 . Mahony 's story ollows the sad career of her own father , a Dublin doctor who had wined the gold rush to Australia . An older writer , W. H.

It is t in an idealized Mediterranean island where corruption and after are the main occupations of freaks and cranks . Sir Max : Beerbohm ( 1872 ? 1956 ) , the urbane , elegant ironist and cartoonist ho had known Wilde and the decadents of the 1890s , published his mic novel of Oxford life , Zuleika Dobson , in 1911 and his comic dies , Seven Men , in 1919 . The former recounts mass suicide by undergraduates infatuated by the adorable Zuleika ; and the latter tirizes literary and social figures with delicious humour and parody . ore brittle than Douglas 's world , more transparent than Beerbohm 's , is that presented in the novellas of Ronald Firbank 886-1926 ) , whose nebulous personalities are so many voices // floating eloquently about the reader 's ears . In Vainglory ( 1915 ) , Caprice ( 1916 ) and Va/mouth ( 1919 ) dialogue is rich in witty aphorism and light irony . The stories ' are vague , indeed negligible . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hector Hugh Munro ) ( 1870 ? 1916 ) , an altogether sourer ironist , was to lose his life on the Western Front , but not before he had made high mockery of English society life . He began by recording the conversation of a frivolous young cynic in the sketches collected as Reginald ( 1904 ) , and then refined his technique of mordant ridicule in short stories and in the novel The Unbearable Bassington ( 1912 ) . Dialogue is often sophisticatedly hilarious . Saki is master of the bitchy riposte and the cynical slap-down ( If one hides one 's talent under a bushel , one must be careful to point out to everyone the exact bushel under which it is hidden ' ) . For sheer sourness , however , he might well be challenged by Caradoc Evans ( 1878-1945 ) , though whereas Saki 's target is London society , Evans 's target is the Welsh peasantry . His collections of short stories ( My People , 1915 ; Cape/ Sion , 1916 ; My Neighbours , 1919 ) are virulent in portraying the savagery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cloaked . One Father in Sion ' keeps his mentally sick wife padlocked in a stable loft and airs her once a week with a cow 's halter round heri neck . Understandably enough , Evans made himself hated . But he is ai powerful stylist , harnessing biblical and Welsh idioms and rhythms . A much sunnier humour marks the portrayal of Irish rural life by E. Oe . Somerville ( 1858 ? 1949 ) and Martin Ross ( properly , Florence Martin ) ( 1862 ? 1914 ) . Their reputation was made back in 1899 by Some Experiences of an Irish RM , a collection of stories in which th well-meaning , but half-English , Resident Magistrate , Major Yeatc does his best to make sense of life lived amid the ingenious antics the locals . Further stories were added in Further Experiences ofan Iris RM ( 1908 ) and In Mr Knox 's Country ( 1915 ) . Meanwhile , in T Charwoman 's Daughter ( 1912 ) , the Irish poet and novelist Jame Stephens ( 1880 ? 1950 ) showed Dublin 's streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day-dreams are her o compensations for the privations of tenement life . Stephens 's " Crock of Cold ( 1912 ) mingles reality and fantasy , fairy tale a philosophy , in a charming hotchpotch . There is no fantasy in the world of Somerset Maugham ( 187 1965 ) , a novelist and dramatist who qualified as a doctor before // turning to writing . There is clinical detachment in his study of human character and surgical precision in ironic judgement . Of Human Bondage ( 1915 ) contains autobiographical material . Philip Carey , an orphan with a club foot ( Maugham himself had a stammer ) , tries vainly to become an artist . Nor is there fantasy in the world of E. M. Forster ( 1879 ? 1970 ) . He organizes his material in a dualistic pattern whereby opposed attitudes to life collide and their respective representatives fail to bridge the gap between them . In WhereAngels Fear to Tread ( 1905 ) the conflict is between English middle-class respectability ( Forster 's favourite target ) which , under a hypocritical exterior , is narrow-minded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Howards End ( 1910 ) the collision is between the solidly efficient but insensitive English family , the Wilcoxes , and the more cultured and sensitive Schlegel sisters , who arc half-German . The Wilcoxes ' world is that of commerce , imperialism and philistinism , while the Schlegels are socialists and go to symphony concerts . A Passage to India ( 1924 ) explores the difficulty of achieving a mutual understanding between the English and the natives in British India . Forster 's message throughout his work is based on respect for passion and truth ' , for personal relations ' , for ' integrity ' , as opposed to conventionalism and rule by accepted ' catchwords ' . Of course the dichotomies he relies upon soon became the cliches of a new conventionalism whose demolition is now under way . Iwo writers who began to make themselves known before the First World War and attained immense popularity later were Hugh 11 alpole ( 1884 ? 1941 ) and Compton Mackenzie ( 1883-1972 ) . Both %cre encouraged by Henry James . Mr Perrin and MrTraill ( 1911 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drew attention to Walpole 's talent , and Sinister Street ( 1913 ) , a thoughtful study of a middle-class boy 's adolescence and development , drew attention to Mackenzie 's . Mackenzie 's facility , the readiness of his humour and his narrative inventiveness guaranteed continuing success in light novels , but he wrote too a massive six-volume fictional survey of his own age , Four Winds of Love ( 1937 ? 45 ) . Walpole 's ambition also irred him to challenging enterprises . The Cathedral ( 1922 ) invited comparison with Trollope , centring as it does on the public and rivate downfall of the Archdeacon of Polchester . And eventually Walpole wrote a monumental family saga chronicling the history of a // Lake District family over a hundred years . Rogue Herries ( 1930 ) was the first volume of The Herries Chronicle . Mackenzie might have claimed that the desire to entertain and the facility to do so in a lifetime 's productivity need not cheapen a writer 's gifts . P. G. Wodehouse ( 1881 ? 1975 ) might be cited to prove the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of characters as well known as any in English literature ? the Hon. Bertie Wooster and his butlerJeeves , Psmith and Aunt Agatha , and lots of idle gentry and their satellites . The style brilliantly caricatures gentlemanly finesse and aristocratic dignity , with earthier tones appropriate to the lower orders . The dramatis personae are put through their paces in situations of adroitly contrived absurdity , yet naturalness of sequence and of dialogue is unbroken for the reader who enters Wodehouse 's world on its own irresistible terms . Leave it to Psmith ( 1923 ) , The Inimitable Jeeves ( 1924 ) and Carry on Jeeves ( 1925 ) show the author at full tide . It is convenient at this point to interpose a note on the beginnings of that current of children 's fiction which has flowed so richly this century . The wider diffusion of culture has made the child readership an important one ; and it may well be that imaginative writers of quality will turn increasingly to this public if adult fiction turns irrecoverably sour . Of course some writers for children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for an older public . Beatrix Potter ( 1866 ? 1943 ) is a case in point . The Tale of Peter Rabbit ( 1902 ) was the first of a series of animal stories , finely illustrated in water-colour , which blended a knowledge of real animals and what one can only call a reverence for their animal individualness with the gift for dressing them up and making them talk . As there is no condescension to rabbits , ducks , hedgehogs and cats ( to Benjamin Bunny , Jemima Puddleduck , Mrs Tiggy-Winkle or even naugh Tom Kitten ) , so there is no condescension to children . When the meaning of credit ' is explained in The Tale of Ginger and Pickles ( a c and a terrier who keep a shop ) , the explanation , you feel , leaves th children understanding the system a good deal more profoundly tha those adults who practise it . Beatrix Potter 's style is inimitahl businesslike and to the point . The narrative line is richly filled out illustrations , notable for scenes of the Lake District where Beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake District also provided the setting for some of Arthur // Ransome 's adventure stories for children of a higher age group . Ransome ( 1884 ? 1967 ) had an interest in outdoor activities like camping and sailing boats and this , together with his knowledge of nature and topography , gave body to his adventure stories such as Swallows and Amazons ( 1931 ) . The children use the vocabulary of adult enterprise and seem conversant with the technical terminology of fairly advanced seamanship , but their explorations are realistic holiday activities and there are reliable , kissable parents in the background . An older writer still , Kenneth Grahame ( 1859 ? 1932 ) , published The Wind in the Willows ( 1908 ) whose setting is the River I lank , where the Good Life is lived by a friendly community of Rat , Mole , Badger and others . They refrain from marriage and work , but mess about unambitiously , especially with boats .

Milne ( 1882 ? 1956 ) had worked as journalist and dramatist before his children 's books took the country 's middle-class families by storm in the 1920s . It was the birth of Milne 's son , Christopher Robin , and the parental need to turn bedtime entertainer that initiated the uncovering of Milne 's immense talent for vivifying tov animals . Appropriate human characteristics ? lovable slowwittedness ( Pooh Bear ) , plaintive self-pity ( Eeyore ) , pathetic ineffectiveness ( tiny Piglet ) and diminutive cheekiness ' ( Roo , pocket edition of Kanga ) ? are read into the toy animals according to their appearance . Stuffed limbs , suitably bedraggled , and stitched eyes were vividly realized in E. H. Shepard 's illustrations . The two prose volumes , Winnie-the-Pooh ( 1926 ) and The House at Pooh Corner ( 1928 ) , built upon the reputation firmly established by Milne 's charmingly versatile verses for children in When We Were 1 en , Young ( 1924 ) , to which Now WeAre Six was added in 1927. t the other end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young provided by a Wodehouse or a Milne stands the sophistication of the ' Bloomsbury Group ' , a coterie of niters and intellectuals with a common interest in love , art and truth , td a common revulsion against the cramping inhibitions of the iddle-class Victorian mind . A key figure in the group was the ographer Lytton Strachey ( 1880 ? 1932 ) , who gained a reputation debunking by frankly deflating the heroes ' of recent history in his // spicy studies of Florence Nightingale , Cardinal Manning and Thomas Arnold in Eminent Victorians ( 1918 ) . He applied the same ironic technique , in some respects less devastatingly and more sentimentally , to the Queen , Prince Albert and others in Queen Victoria ( 1921 ) . A writer at the centre of the group was Virginia Woolf ( 1882 ? 1941 ) . She was a woman of great sensitivity , subject to mental depression , and she took her own life at the height of the air war in England . Virginia Woolf felt that standard fictional techniques of traditional plotting and character projection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events . To this extent she had affinities with Proust and Joyce . She replaced the standard techniques of presentation ? description , narrative and dialogue , arranged in successive chunks ? with a stream of consciousness ' which could represent the fluidity of the inner life and the sharp richness of the little experiences and sensations that stimulate it . Virginia Woolf thus evolved a technique in which characters are not presented ' to the reader : rather the content of their inner lives impinges on the reader . In Mrs Dalloway ( 1925 ) events take place in a single summer day in the life of Clarissa Dalloway , but the substance of the book is contained in mental reflections and flashbacks that reconstruct Mrs Dalloway 's past . To the Lighthouse ( 1927 ) extends the technique , handling a group of people centred on the Ramsey family in the ' seaside home .

Virginia Woolf intended the book as a tribute to her frie Victoria Sackville-West ( 1892 ? 1962 ) , whose novel The Edwardi ( 1930 ) gives a lively first-hand account of life in a ducal residence the early years of the century . In Virginia Woolf 's The Waves ( 193 the externals of action and dialogue are totally submerged , and reader is taken into the minds of a group of growing characters w know one another when young , but whose ways diverge for m years . The personality of each is reflected in the minds of the oth so that a kaleidoscopic pattern emerges , corresponding in its glittering fluidity to the movement of the sea . // To some extent Virginia Woolf 's experimentation had been anticipated by Dorothy Richardson ( 1873 ? 1957 ) whose vast thirteennovel work , Pilgrimage , began with the publication of Pointed Roofs in 1915 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a deliberate attempt to produce a feminine alternative to masculine realism . But the narrative flags under the weight of undifferentiated detail . A vastly different innovator was D. H. Lawrence ( 1885-1930 ) . Lis working-class background , his obsession with sexual passion , his open determination to preach , and his casual attitude to the novel as an art form are four characteristics that distinguish him from Virginia Woolf . His father was a Nottinghamshire miner , barely literate , and his mother an ex-schoolteacher increasingly dissatisfied with her husband 's cultural level and desperately anxious for ' Bertie ' ( David Herbert ) , her favourite , to rise above his origins . Mrs Lawrence 's possessive devotion to her son and the tension of the family situation are represented autobiographically in the novel Sons and Lovers ( 1913 ) . In a finely realized account of mining life in the Midlands , the situation of the Morel family parallels that of the Lawrences . Mrs Morel 's background was middle-class and the passion that caused her to marry her miner husband has died , to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul . Paul 's psychological development is traced with subtlety , especially the growth of his interest in hooks and painting and the course of his early love affairs with Miriam and Clara . The boy can not escape the overpowering emotional bond imposed by his mother 's love and he fails to achieve a fulfilling relationship with either girl . The personality of Miriam ( ' nearly sixteen , very beautiful , with her warm colouring , her gravity , her eyes dilating suddenly like an ecstasy ' ) , pitted against the competitive emotional demand of Paul 's mother ( who dies of cancer ) , movingly alive ; and Jessie Chambers , whom Miriam represents , s written her own reminiscences of Lawrence since his death . ( See 11 . Lawrence , A Personal Record , by E. T. , 1935 . ) After teacher training at University College , Nottingham , and subsequent teaching at Croydon , Lawrence turned to full-time citing , publishing The White Peacock in 1911 and The Trespasser in 912 . In the meantime his mother had died and in 1912 Lawrence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from her husband professor at Nottingham ) and her three children to the Continent . // Sexual passion thus had a practical primacy for him over other . obligations , and it was again his preoccupation in The Rainbow ( 1915 ) and in Women in Love ( 1920 ) . The former covers the lives of three generations of a Nottinghamshire family , the Brangwens , but is especially concerned with the emotional career of Ursula Brangwen , a sensitive woman who rejects the deadening mechanization of spirit and environment by the mining industry . The theme ramifies in the sequel , Women in Love . Here Gudrun and her sister , Ursula , are paired with Gerald Crich , son of a mine-owner , and Rupert Birkin , a school inspector . Gerald is representative of the industrial ethic and Birkin spokesman for the passionate self that must assert its integrity against the cramping pressures of mechanized industrialism and the domination of intellect . Lawrence was now using the novel form to hammer out a view of life and to exercise a radical effect on his readers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-fiction work , Fantasia of the Unconscious . But one must remember that Lawrence was not a static thinker . He does not hesitate to pit idea against idea : even theories that he likes may he propounded by one character and taken to pieces by another . He lives his own problems on paper . The marital difficulties of Richard Lovat Somers and his wife in kangaroo ( 1923 ) are projected from Lawrence 's own experience with Frieda . The book gives a rich portrayal of Australian life and scenery . Cooley , the underground fascist leader , is a Nietzschean devotee of blood-consciousness ' , but Somers in the end rejects his leadership . The Plumed Serpent ( 1926 ) set in Mexico , develops the Nietzschean theme and gives it a religious dimension . Set against the alien Catholic culture is an Aztec cult is rooted in sex and blood-consciousness and exalts the domin male over the passive female . One is aware of an almost demonic ur driving Lawrence towards the assertion of unexplored naturalis allegiances to replace the civilizational values he hated and h rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 1928 ) made his most notorious book . It takes us back to Nottinghamshire . S Clifford Chatterley has returned from the war paralysed below waist . His impotence is made symbolic of the sterile upper-cl establishment . Mellors , the gamekeeper , representative of lowe class virility , provides the sexual satisfaction Chatterley 's wi Connie , desperately needs . In attempting to intensify the collisi between what is vital and what is moribund , Lawrence made free // of four-letter ' words in the love relationship . The urge to rescue such words from the slough of comic obscenity was vain . In 1914 Ezra Pound was already describing Lawrence and Joyce as the two strongest prose writers among les jeunes ' .1 James Joyce ( 1882 ? 1941 ) was born and educated in Dublin . His incorrigibly thriftless father and struggling mother brought up their children ( ten of them ) ever nearer the edge of poverty , but Joyce was thoroughly educated at Catholic schools and at University College , Dublin . Then , after a year in Paris , and a return to Dublin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nora Barnacle in 1904 and kept himself by teaching until he was able ( with the help of patronage ) to be a full-time writer . It was not until 1914 that Joyce managed to get his book of short stories , Dubliners , published . The stories are written with deceptive simplicity and deal successively with events of childhood , youth and adulthood . Some show the nullifying effect of the Dublin social and mental environment on characters whose dreams , hopes and ambitions are pathetically or tragically unfulfilled . The rhythm of aspiration and disappointment or resignation recurs at various levels of sophistication ; and the element of stylization in the patterning of the material , together with the evident recourse to symbolism , foreshadows Joyce 's later work . 4 Portrait oftheArtist as a YoungMan had been long a-writing when it came out in 1916 . It reworked much material in Stephen Hero , a manuscript that has been posthumously published ( 1944 ) . It is as much rooted in autobiographical experience as Lawrence 's Sons and Lovers yet the artistic technique is so different that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hero close in sympathy and distances him in irony : the resultant blend of pathos and humour is piquant . Of course Stephen 's recollections of home , school , first love , and awakening cultural interests have an unmistakably authentic core ; but the final artistic self-dedication is to silence , exile , and cunning ' , and silence and cunning imply abandonment of direct openness . The adoption of literary subterfuges ? symbolism , labyrinthinism , and formality hidden inside naturalism ? are as important in the total artistic vocation as the need by exile to escape Irish politics , religion ml sentimentality . Joyce 's presentation of Stephen 's experience // from within Stephen 's own mind involves use of styles in tune with infant thought , childhood thought , adolescent thought and student thought successively . Sensitive adjustment of idiom to the thinker 's moods and understanding , whether they are healthy or not , involves walking on a stylistic tightrope stretched precariously between involvement and detachment . The thematic use of images establishes continuing symbolic connections . Stephen Dedalus 's own name brings together that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of classical legend . With Ulysses ( 1922 ) we reach a masterpiece of epic proportions . The framework is linked to the Odyssey . Odysseus 's years of wandering , his son Telemachus 's search for him , and the return to Penelope , are echoed in the story of Leopold Bloom , Dublin advertisement canvasser , Stephen Dedalus ( who is in search of spiritual , fatherhood ) , and Molly , Bloom 's much-loved but sexually neglected wife . For wanderings about the world of ancient myth we have wanderings about the city of Dublin . All is compressed within one June day ( the 16th ) in 1904 . The full development of the stream-ofconsciousness ' technique enables Bloom 's past life to be grasped in retrospect . The technique faithfully records the flow of thought and feeling , doing justice to persistent emotional currents and logical randomness alike . The natural flow of mental reflection , the shifting moods and impulses that constitute the fabric of inner life , are represented with uncanny penetration . But readers who see only th far miss much of Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeds , Joyce 's poetry ' continuously throws up metaphors , sym bols , ambiguities and overtones which gradually link themselv together so as to form a network of connections and cros connections binding the whole edifice in unity . Leopold Bloom has been sexually separated from his wife for to years since the birth and tragic death , eleven days later , of the ' longed-for son , Rudy . Leopold is a Jew . His separation from Molly not only comparable to Odysseus 's separation from Penelope , for upgrading of Bloom to epic status is part of a wider enrichment significance . Joyce 's imagery makes Bloom the focus of univer human tensions . His hunger for Molly is an aspect of everyman hunger for his earth goddess , for his mother , for the warmth a security and fulfilment which earth can never permanently provid Therefore it corresponds with man 's idealistic turning to Church a // Madonna , mystical Bride and Divine Spouse . The imagery gives Molly a changing status : she may correspond to mother country , Mother Church , or mother of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspond now with Ireland 's betrayal of her children , now with Eve 's betrayal of Adam , and now ( via a symbolic reading of Hamlet ) with betrayal by the frail , erring human flesh of the manhood it has mothered . The system of correspondences enables Joyce to take a panoramic ( even encyclopedic ) view of the human situation while never for a moment relaxing his grip on the particular : for Ulysses is alive throughout with the savour and salt oflife in Dublin in 1904 . The reader is deeply immersed in the currents of its private and public life . But Joyce makes Dublic everyman 's city . In its association with Molly it is a potential reflection of Urbs Beata , the New Jerusalem , though Bloom , materialistic twentieth-century everyman , whose eye is on the main chance , would prefer to see it turned into the New Bloomusalem , with electric dishscrubbers , bonuses for all , universal brotherhood and free love thrown in . The eighteen episodes are divided into three books ( three , twelve , three ) with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bloom 's wanderings in Dublin , takes us spiralling down the circles of modern unreality ' ( in newspaper office , library and the like ) to the depths of the twentieth-century Inferno in the brothels of Nighttown . The moral pattern is clear . In Molly 's adultery we see the home bet rayed from without and within ( by Boylan 's intrusion , by Bloom 's fastidious neglect ) . Molly is Eve seduced by Satan , Ireland usurped by the British , the Church betrayed from within , the flesh of man let down by the selfish masculine intellect . Ireland is betrayed by those who rend her dedicated prophetic leaders , by those who sell her horses to the enemy for cash , by those who sell her artistic soul for cash ( as establishment writers do ) and by those who sell her young womanhood for cash in the Dublin brothels . The humour of the book balances its profundity ; the stylistic virtuosity matches the magnitude of the conception . Each episode isplays Joyce 's literary skill in a distinct style appropriate to the substance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ulysses . Its delights and its illuminations for the reader are excitingly Ided to with every reading , however many . At the end of several , the , der will wish to try Finnegans Wake ( 1939 ) where new techniques verbal ambiguity allow for the accumulation of simultaneous // meanings at a new level of complexity . Joyce had experimented in Ulysses with new words like menagerer ' which derives a threefold connotation from manager ' , menage ' and menagerie ' . By developing this method of compression and calling in the aid of other languages than English , he gave additional dimensions to the tale of a Dublin publican and his family , touching the cosmic and the archetypal at one extreme and the personal ( autobiographical ) at the other . The text is difficult . Joyce could justify his method on the grounds that the world of Finnegan Wake is the dream world in which we spend a good part of our lives , and where shifting identities , multiple significances and absurdly incongruous composite impressions are commonplace . An exciting writer in close touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1884-1957 ) . He shared the anti-romantic ' drive towards reinstating artistic impersonality and the values of intelligence ; for he hated current indulgence of the artistic personality and sentimental denigration of intellect and objectivity . He had no sympathy with Lawrence 's cultivation of the primitive and the unconscious nor with the stream-of-consciousness ' technique because of its internality and intuitiveness . As an artist he led a movement known as Vorticism ' , yet he wrote prolifically as novelist and polemicist . Time and Western Man ( 1927 ) has perhaps been most celebrated among his polemical books . The summit of his work as a novelist i. represented by the trilogy , Childermass ( 1928 ) , Monstre Gai an . Malign Fiesta ( both 1955 ) , a fantastic satirical epic in which we first see the mass of humanity gathered outside Heaven and facing supernatural judgement before a peculiar authority ( half man , half dwarf ) known as the Bailiff . Great claims have been made for Wyndham Lewis by his admirers . He has been compared to Swift fo the intellectual passion of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mission of judgement . A more cheerful , less vitriolic satirist , who later however turned solemn sage , was Aldous Huxley ( 1894-1963 ) . Grandson of T. H. Huxley , the scientist , and connected through his mother with Matt hew Arnold , he was a man of intellect . His early novels were wi satirical studies of the fashionable cultural circles of the 1921 Huxley 's casual display of erudition and his capacity to give highbro status to cleverness about current cleverness ( and wickedness ) gave him a cult appeal to the student as a kind of educated Noel Cowan
