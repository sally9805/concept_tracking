" <P> GAO investigators focused on changes between 1950 and 1982 in the five- year survival rates for victims of twelve types of cancer . Advances in detection and treatment , they conceded , had resulted in improvements in these survival rates ( measured from the time of diagnosis ) , except for stomach cancer . Yet they criticized the NCI 's reliance on these rates as proof of gains against cancer , noting that some types of the disease , such as breast and prostate cancers , can progress for ten or 15 years before proving fatal .
