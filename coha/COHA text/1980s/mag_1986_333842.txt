What on earth was half of the Reagan Administration , or what seemed like it , doing in Europe last week while Washington burned ? There was Secretary of State George Shultz , arriving in London on the first leg of a five-day fence- mending trip . While in the British capital , he crossed paths with Attorney General Edwin Meese , who had come to urge a meeting of European Community interior ministers to stand tough against terrorism . Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger had just been in Belgium shoring up U.S. arms-control positions with his NATO counterparts . And at week 's end Shultz led a platoon of top officials , including Treasury Secretary James Baker , to Brussels to talk about some prickly economic issues . <P> All diplomatic eyes were on Shultz . The Secretary 's agenda listed a variety of arms-control issues , but he was clearly there to hold European hands and soothe European fears about the stability of American foreign policy in the wake of the Iran-contra arms scandal . " I have a rebuilding job to do , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Iran policy well known , had the unenviable task of persuading the allies that the investigations have not seriously hampered President Reagan 's ability to manage U.S. foreign policy . <P> While sympathetic to Shultz 's mission , European leaders were still indignant about " Iranscam " and skeptical that Reagan will be able to put the scandal quickly behind him . Just before Shultz arrived , a senior British official privately complained that he was " dismayed and disappointed " at the U.S. 's departure from its stated refusal to negotiate with terrorists . The conclusion that U.S. foreign policy will be affected , declared NATO Secretary- General Lord Carrington , should occur to " anybody who reads the newspapers about what is happening in Washington . " <P> The crisis intensified Europe 's growing feeling that it must join together to assert its strategic interests in superpower negotiations . Since the summit at Reykjavik , where the Europeans were horrified to see Reagan come close to abolishing their nuclear umbrella , calls for greater European security cooperation have been increasing . The most powerful statement came two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European security agreement to ensure a strong nuclear deterrent on the Continent . In addition , since Reykjavik , European leaders have relied even more on their long-standing system of informal contacts among top aides to help formulate and coordinate policy options , especially in relation to U.S. moves . <P> Shultz tried to convince the Europeans that the U.S. will not abandon its nuclear shield over Western Europe , despite Reagan 's controversial proposal in Reykjavik to eliminate all ballistic missiles over a ten-year period . Reiterating his statement of last month , he said at the annual meeting of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels that even if agreement were reached to scrap most nuclear missiles " a small residual ballistic-missile force " would remain as " insurance " to guard against Soviet cheating . Shultz was also careful to discourage speculation that a politically weakened President might be hustled into a disadvantageous deal with the Soviets . Said he : " If they think there is an opening , they should get over it . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
