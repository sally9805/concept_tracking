" Aw , Mom , I feel awful ! Can I stay home from school ? " In the old days , mothers could indulge plaints of colds and other minor ills with plenty of chicken soup and tlc . But in an era of two-income families , few parents can afford to skip work every time Junior comes down with a real or imaginary malady . This dilemma has spawned a new type of day-care facility for children with mild illnesses . More than three dozen of these so-called sniffle centers have opened for business around the U.S. , often bearing names right out of A.A. Milne , like Wheezles and Sneezles in Berkeley . <P> Some sniffle centers employ nurses or other medically trained personnel who know how to treat illnesses and keep them from spreading . Chicken Soup , a nonprofit center that opened in Minneapolis last October , separates children into the Sniffles Room for colds , the Popsicle Room for stomach flu and the Polka Dot Room for chicken pox . <P> Parents are enthusiastic about the centers . Says Barbara Segal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her four-year-old son Stephen to North Miami Beach 's new Sniffles ' n Sneezes : " The hardest thing for a working mother is to take time off . Last time my son got sick at school , I had to take him back to the office with me . " <P> The centers vary widely in price , but most cost far less than a private nurse , who might charge $20 an hour . California 's San Juan Bautista Child Development Center , which gets financial help from United Way and the city of San Jose , has fees ranging from nothing to $20 a day , depending on the parents ' income . Sniffles Medical Day Care Center in suburban Minneapolis , which serves an affluent clientele , charges $9 an hour . <P> Most of the facilities are open year-round , but Berkeley 's Wheezles and Sneezles closes during the summer . Reason : when school is out and the weather is nice , business falls off dramatically .                   @ @
