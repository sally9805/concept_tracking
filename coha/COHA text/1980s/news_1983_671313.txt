The 6-foot-2-inch sophomore also scored on a 20-foot jump shot and on drives in which she double-pumped in the air or hung in the air and altered the arc of her shot to avoid defenders. // Though she was playing forward , she helped U.S.C. ' s inexperienced guards break the Georgia press . She played aggressive defense , twice batting away passes , recovering the loose ball and then dribbling the length of the court for layups . And when Georgia ' s screaming coach , Andy Landers , was assessed two technical fouls , Miss Miller shot the free throws. // // // Handcuffs the Only Defense // Making 13 of 17 shots from the floor and 5 of 7 free throws , she finished with 31 points . Afterward , Landers was asked whether there was a defense for her . " Handcuffs , " he said , adding that she was the best player in the country. // A few days later , Coach Linda Sharp of U.S.C. went further , saying that Miss Miller was the best female player ever . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for college basketball , " said the 32-year- old Miss Sharp , who is in her seventh year at U.S.C. // This year , with the Trojans trying to shore up some weaknesses in their attempt to repeat as the National Collegiate Athletic Association champions , Miss Miller ' s role as a complete player is more important than ever. // The Trojans are magnificent inside with Miss Miller and Paula and Pam McGee , the 6-3 twins from Flint , Mich . Miss Miller and Paula McGee were all-Americans last year , and Pam McGee played in the Pan American Games . Landers called the Trojans ' front line , which is averaging 59. 8 points and just over 33 rebounds a game , the best in the country . <> <> Problems at Guard // At guard , however , the Trojans could have problems . Rhonda Windham of John F. Kennedy High School in the Bronx , who started at point guard as a freshman last season and averaged 7 points a game , is out for the season with a knee injury . Cynthia Cooper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard , is academically ineligible. // Miss Sharp has replaced them with Amy Alkek , a 5-8 freshman from Victoria , Tex. , and Juliette Robinson , a 5-9 senior from Long Beach , Calif. , who was a reserve last season . Opponents have tried to pressure the inexperienced guards . But it has not worked. // " I think we have the potential to win again , " says Miss Sharp , " as long as our guards continue to improve and have an understanding of their role , which is to get high-percentage shots , control the tempo and get the ball into the front line. " // While the guards are learning , they will rely heavily on help from Miss Miller . Comparing her to other great players , Miss Sharp said : " Carol Blazejowski was a great shooter but didn ' t really have all the concepts of defense . Nancy Lieberman was a great passer and ball handler . Ann Meyers played both ends of the court and was a very solid team player . She had some of the same offensive skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope Ann doesn ' t hate me for saying that , but I ' d tell her if I saw her . " <> <> Led Team in Scoring // Miss Miller is a sophomore from Riverside , Calif. , who will not be 20 years old until Jan. 3 but who led U.S.C. last season in scoring , with 20. 4 points per game ; in steals , 115 for the season , and in blocked shots , 79. // This year , she has resumed where she left off , averaging 23. 9 points and leading the 8-0 Trojans in blocks , steals and assists. // After U.S.C. beat Georgia , Miss Miller stood outside the locker room for an hour surrounded by reporters with pencils and microphones. // A broadcast journalism major , Miss Miller was articulate , but she looked a little wan following two recent fainting spells . She was ill before the Trojans played Northwestern on Nov. 28 and again on Dec. 9 , six days before the Georgia game. // Extensive tests in three local hospitals revealed nothing , and Miss Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basketball schedule and a diet centered on junk food , or no food at all . When she gets especially busy , she explained , she doesn ' t eat. // Since she went to the hospital for the tests , Miss Miller says , she ' s been eating and feeling better , which was good news for Miss Sharp . Despite its overall talent , it is doubtful that U.S.C. could repeat as N.C.A.A. champions without Miss Miller . <> <> Played With Her Brothers // She is so versatile partly because her father coached her early and partly because she started playing against her three brothers when she was 6 years old . Miss Miller ' s father , Saul , a 6-5 computer technician , put a paved , lighted basketball halfcourt in the back yard when the family moved to a new home six years ago . He staged scrimmages with neighborhood boys and girls , videotaping his children to point out their strengths and weaknesses . One of her brothers , Darrell , is a catcher- outfielder in the California Angels minor league system , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at U.C.L.A. Cheryl and Reggie often won wagers against unsuspecting two-man teams. // In her four years at Riverside Polytechnic High School she dunked in one game , scored 105 points in another and led her team to a 132-4 record that included 84 straight victories . After her junior year , she was named to the the United States national women ' s basketball team , the only high school athlete on the squad that toured Europe. // She chose U.S.C. over 250 other schools , and despite her recognition has refused to proclaim herself the greatest , saying that playing with her brothers is what made her versatile . When she is asked whether there is a defense to stop her , though , she says no. // " That ' s because of my brothers and playing with the guys , " she said . " One thing that makes a great player is the ability to score no matter what . They can have three or four players hanging on them or they can move without the ball and trade opportunity. // " I can sit and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yard and practice a move and have it down . That ' s what I do . I love to watch men play . That ' s the only way I think women can get better. " // //
