The reasons are obscure , but rather than culminating the efforts of a decade in a searing success , Sargent created a furor the like of which had not been seen since Manet exhibited his notorious Olympia . ( I am touched that Sargent , together with Claude Monet , headed a private subscription to purchase Manet 's masterpiece for an ungrateful French state : Olympia was not shown until 1917 , and Sargent kept Madame X in his studio until 1905 , twenty-one years after the debacle . ) As a result , Sargent cut his ties with Paris , where the great promise of the Venetian years might have been fulfilled , and removed himself to England , which has been an artistic backwater at the best of times . There he turned into a rather superficial artist , the maker of dazzling portraits and dubious Impressionist studies . He tried to make contact with some deeper source of artistic meaning when he undertook the mural cycle for the Boston Public Library . But all light has fled from these turgid works ; one feels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a profound mistake . The subjects of tragedies can also live happily ever after , the tragedy consisting in just that . Sargent never lost the Velazquez touch , which is there for us to marvel at in the gallery of stunning portraits that is the heart of the show ( even if a heart worn on the sleeve ) . I had the pleasure of Patricia Hills 's company in walking through the exhibition on my second visit ? Hills organized the show and edited the catalogue to which she also contributed some fine essays  --  and together we responded to the authority with which Sargent transacted a lavender sash or evoked a bow out of a few curls and dabs of white paint . No one alive today could show the flesh through thin fabric as in his portrait of Lady Agnew 's left arm . No one alive today Could , as in a scene of Venetian glass blowers , drag a brush across the canvas so that each bristle picks out a separate rod , and we see brushstroke and rod bundle in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I would start from as far away as possible , when the illusion was complete , and come gradually nearer , until suddenly what had been a hand , and a ribbon and a piece of velvet dissolved into a fricassee of beautiful brushstrokes . I thought I might learn some-thing if I could catch the moment at which this transformation took place , but it proved to be as elusive as the ' moment between sleeping and waking . The elusive moment is that of the boundary between matter and art , perhaps between body and mind . But you can have that experience over and over in the work of Sargent . He really had the divine prerogative of lifting life out of paint with the turn of his amazing wrist , and it is , I think , a lost art . There is no Carolus-Duran any longer to teach us how . Spehd some time studying the buckle on the belt of Mrs. I.N. Phelps Stokes , from 1897 . And contemplate her white skirt , which falls in heavy folds to the ground . Sargent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to Hills . But there is none of the poetry that left the work after the fiasco with Madame Gautreau 's portrait , and that is so palpable a substance in the Venetian interiors that you will want to ? return to them again and again . Except for the portraits , in the years after 1884 the work seems to me dry and flat . Sargent tried Impressionism , but that is not a country for old masters , and I feel he had no internal understanding of what revolutions in touch and vision Impressionism implied . His watercolors have the look of examples of how to do watercolors , and if one did not knOw them to be by Sargent , one would suppose them resurrected from the annual of some provincial watercolor society . It was a style of depositing wash on paper that others could and did acquire . I find his drawings equally dry , for all the certitude of touch and his perfect draughtsmanly control . In none of the work after 1884 do we sense any urgency of feeling or the presence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
