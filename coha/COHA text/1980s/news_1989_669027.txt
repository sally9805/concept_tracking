To those who coached him and watched him play , Eddie Pope had what it takes to make it as a professional basketball star . At 6-foot-9 and 240 pounds , he was a heavily recruited , three-time all-state basketball player back in Hattiesburg , Miss. , and a freshman sensation at the University of Southern Mississippi . His former college coach , M.K. Turk , recalls Pope as a likable kid and a big-time player who never gave anyone any trouble . He more than held his own against future pro stars at such basketball powerhouses as Louisville and Memphis State and made the Metro Conference All-Freshman team in 1984 . " He was an excellent player for me . In my opinion , he had all the tools to make it in the NBA , " Turk said in a telephone interview from Hattiesburg . But Eddie Pope never got past his first year in college and never made it to the National Basketball Association . He ' s in a hospital room in Buenos Aires , a police guard at the foot of his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m feeling kind of bad right now , " Pope said the other day , shaking his head sadly . " I ' ve got a lot of problems . " Pope , 23 , a star center for the Rivadavia de Necochea team in Argentina ' s professional basketball league , is accused by the police of throwing his girlfriend , Nirvana Ercoli , 30 , out a fifth-story window on July 29 after pummeling her unconscious and beating up her sister , Teresa , 24 , in Teresa ' s Buenos Aires apartment . Pope said he doesn ' t remember how it happened , but he fell out the window , too , landing on Nirvana ' s body . There he was arrested after the younger sister called police . Recovering in the hospital from a bruised spine , Pope is alone , confused and afraid , a black man in serious trouble in a strange white land . No court date has been set , but he faces a possible life sentence in an Argentine prison if convicted of murder . The case has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heels of the recent murder conviction of former world middleweight boxing champion Carlos Monzon after a similar incident . Monzon , an Argentine national hero , received a 20-year sentence for throwing his girlfriend out a window to her death in the seaside resort of Mar del Plata . For more than two weeks , Pope has sat in his hospital room , going over in his mind what happened that night and how a life once filled with promise came to this . He met Nirvana four years ago , while he was playing in Mar del Plata and shuttling between Argentina and France on the international professional basketball circuit , he said . She followed him to Paris , where they planned to marry after she told him she was pregnant . But it turned out she wasn ' t pregnant . Theirs was a stormy relationship . " We used to fight in France , " he said . " But I never meant to hurt her . " He canceled the marriage plans after " she said something bad about black people " to a neighbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , and Nirvana spent the week before her death staying with Pope in his Buenos Aires hotel room . Teresa Ercoli disapproved of the relationship , Pope said , and tried to keep her sister away from him . A couple of weeks ago , he went to see Nirvana at Teresa ' s apartment , Pope said . Inside , he saw Nirvana ' s hand sticking out of a closet . She was unconscious , he said . " I pushed Teresa down to get ( to ) Nirvana , " he said . " And she wasn ' t talking ; she was kind of out . So I just picked her up and carried her over to the window sill to get some air . Then I don ' t remember what happened after that . " Pope said he doesn ' t know how they went out the window , saying he has a bump on his head and hinting he might have been pushed . " The knot on my head messes up my memory sometimes , " he said . " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nirvana ' s family say the facts are different . Teresa has testified that Pope beat her in a rage , then beat her sister unconscious and threw her out the window before lowering himself and jumping down to get away , said Officer Hugo Rodriguez , a watch commander for the Buenos Aires police . Pope spoke wistfully of going to France next month , where he has played pro ball for the last two years and has a big contract to play again this season . But he said his mind frequently is diverted to other things . " I think of my court case and how to beat this , " he said . " And if I get some ( prison ) time , how I can take it . One thing , at least they don ' t have the ( electric ) chair here , so I can ' t get that . " They don ' t have a witness to what happened and I didn ' t try to do it , so maybe I can get temporary manslaughter ( sic ) or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles will crush his mother , Annie , back in Hattiesburg . The second of four children , Pope has a sister who is a doctor and a younger brother playing football at Southern Mississippi . His father , Eddie Pope Sr. , who he said was a professional football player , died two years ago . Pope recalls his home fondly . " Hattiesburg is a real nice town , a real quiet place , " he said . But now Pope is a long way from Hattiesburg . He was a celebrity in high school and was recruited by colleges around the country , said Turk , his former coach . But he settled on Southern Miss , right in his hometown . " It was very difficult for a freshman to come in and play at this level in the Metro Conference , but he did it and he did it well , " Turk said . Poor grades forced Pope out of school after his freshman year , though , and soon afterward he left to play in Italy , then France and Argentina . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was , " Turk said . " He seemed to be doing very well playing professionally overseas . This is just a very tragic situation . " Pope spoke with his mother on the phone the other night for the first time since the incident , he said . " I told her about my problem and I told her maybe I was going to get out of it and be in France in the next month or so , " he said . " They ' re waiting on me to come over there and play . But now I don ' t know if I ' m going to make it . " CAPTION : PHOTO : AP Laserphoto . Eddie Pope . Illustration PHOTO <>
