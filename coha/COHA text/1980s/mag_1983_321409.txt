Aboard next week 's shuttle flight : America 's first black astronaut <P> This is going smooth as silk . " Thus , with only days to go , NASA Spokesman Jim Kukowski ebulliently described the final launch preparations for next week 's flight of the Challenger space shuttle . Lift-off for the eighth mission of NASA 'S Space Transportation System , known as STS-8 , is scheduled for Aug. 30 at 2:15 a.m. at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , just two months after Challenger 's historic flight carrying the first American woman into space . That is the shortest turnaround time yet between shuttle flights . This time there will be three more firsts : the nighttime launch , a nighttime landing and the presence in the crew of a black astronaut . <P> The lift-off will mark the U.S. 's first nocturnal launch of a manned spacecraft since Apollo 17 roared away in a blaze of fire and smoke shortly after midnight on Dec. 7 , 1972 . The glow was seen by residents of the Great Smoky Mountains , 500 miles away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be even more brilliant : the shuttle 's engines and twin solid-fuel rocket boosters will generate a temperature of 6,000 F , double that produced by the Apollo . <P> The orbiter 's landing , planned for 12:43 a.m. on Sept. 5 at Edwards Air Force Base in California , will be eerie in a different way . Like a huge ghost ship , the 100-ton Challenger will silently sweep in over the Mojave Desert with nary a beacon light blinking . It will not be visible until it is about 200 feet above the runway ; then it will begin reflecting the illumination from batteries of xenon searchlights along the strip . <P> NASA 's nighttime dazzler , while useful practice for future shuttle service , is required by the mission 's major objective : putting into orbit a giant communications and weather satellite for India . The $45 million instrument will be spun away from the Challenger on the second day of the flight . To site it correctly , the shuttle has to be placed in a different orbit from its seven predecessors , one that can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rigid rules of orbital mechanics , only a night landing is possible . Otherwise , the spaceship would have to circle the earth for a month before finding a daytime window through which to come down . <P> The mission specialist aboard ST58 who will launch the satellite from the shuttle 's payload bay is Air Force Lieut . Colonel Guion ( Guy ) S. Bluford Jr. , 40 , America 's first black astronaut , though not the first black in space . That distinction belongs to Arnaldo Tamayo Mendez of Cuba , who was sent aloft with Soviet cosmonauts in 1980 . Other members of the crew : Navy Captain Richard Truly , the flight commander , flying his second shuttle mission ; Navy Commander Daniel C. Brandenstein , the Challenger 's pilot ; Navy Lieut . Commander Dale Gardner , who will help deploy the Indian satellite ; and Physician William E. Thornton , who will study physiological changes in space .
