regulatory agencies try to keep // the public out of their affairs. // And the Federal Communications Commission was one of the most clever , because they set up this policy that said you had to have ' standing ' in order to deal with them , and standing only came with an economic interest . I thought that through and concluded that the public did have ' standing ' and an economic interest , because they owned radios and television sets. " // The speaker is Dr. Everett C. Parker , who retires this month after 30 years as director of the Office of Communication for the United Church of Christ . During a recent interview , Dr. Parker reflected on those three decades and concluded that the public still has to bang on the doors of the major media and the F.C.C. in order to assure that justice is done. // And he should know . From the denomination ' s New York headquarters at 105 Madison Avenue , the minister who produced some of the first educational radio and television programs for children has doggedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minority concerns or showed contempt for the public ' s right to have a say in what goes on the air . He has testified before F.C.C. hearings dozens of times , recruited an army of volunteers to monitor stations on public-interest issues and , over the years while head of a major office in the 1. 75 million-member United Church of Christ , brought many of the nation ' s religious bodies into the campaign for responsible broadcasting. // " All we ' ve ever wanted to to is make it possible for people to express themselves through the system of broadcasting , " he explained . " If broadcasters are to serve the public interest , they need to be reminded that they serve **28;116; all <> the publics. " // For Dr. Parker , the ethical imperative in broadcasting is deeply rooted in both religious principles and the public interest . Yet , his main priority has not been to have more religious programming ; indeed , Dr. Parker dislikes much of what is already on television today and believes it is unjust for stations to broadcast the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His view of mission has not been that of a television evangelist building mailing lists for fund-raising appeals . " If churches are on the air , " he said , " they have a responsibility to render a service , not just to use the airwaves for their own self-interest or to raise money to buy more time to raise more money. " // Still , Dr. Parker reiterated a worry he has often voiced about trends within the broadcasting industry that he feels undermine the churches ' efforts - at their best - to build a more humane world. // " People in other parts of the world are looking at the United States with open mouths , wondering why we have turned ourselves over to business as a laboratory to see how much they can make off new technologies , " he said. // " As these new technologies come along , such as direct broadcasting from a satellite , there has been no public debate on how we should use them , " he added . " It ' s not even like the early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his concern for the public ' s interest in broadcasting that caused Dr. Parker in the mid-60 ' s to use the agency he headed for the United Church of Christ to challenge the license of WLBT-TV in Jackson , Miss. , the first time that a church or indeed any public-interest group had taken on the F.C.C. on behalf of a segment of the public . Having compiled detailed broadcast logs of WLBT ' s programs in 1964 , the church contended that the station ignored or was hostile to the concerns of black viewers , 40 percent of the population in Jackson . The F.C.C. refused to act , but Dr. Parker and others fought the case for five years , which resulted in a landmark decision by Chief Justice Warren Burger , then a Circuit Court judge , who declared that members of the public had the right to intervene in license proceedings. // The judge subsequently revoked the license of WLBT , the first time a station was ever punished for disobeying its legal mandate to serve " the public interest , convenience or necessity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his church became public-interest gadflies throughout the broadcast industry , starting investigations into minority-hiring practices , the depiction of women and minorities on the air , and the threat of conglomerate monopoly control of the airwaves . The actions have drawn attention to practices within the broadcast industry , and Dr. Parker and his office have become magnets for other groups interested in media monitoring. // Nonetheless , Dr. Parker continues to be as irritated with some of his colleagues in religion as he is with the broadcast industry because he feels that they are often slow to see the ethical importance of the causes he has long championed . For instance , he believes that expanding technology has not meant expanding access to the media . " The more new means of communication science develops , the fewer are the opportunities for people like us to have a say , " he told his denomination this summer. // // Dr. Parker first linked broadcasting and social justice shortly after he graduated from high school in Chicago . The city ' s financial system had crumbled and school teachers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the unpaid teachers , and when they were offered free time to explain their position on radio station WCFL , the teachers asked the young graduate to produce the programs. // At the time , he recalled , he had never seen a microphone . Nevertheless , during the next three months , he developed a series of programs about the teachers and the financial crisis . From that time on , broadcasting and social justice were merged in his mind. // After graduating from the University of Chicago in 1935 , he set up the radio department for the Works Progress Administration in Washington and later managed stations in New Orleans and Hammond , Ind . In Hammond , where he produced a daily series of religious programs , a sense of calling to the ministry developed and he entered Chicago Theological Seminary to prepare for ordination in the Congregational Christian Churches. // Before long , he was using his ministerial skills and broadcast background to help churches make better use of radio and television and to see the ethical implications of the rapidly expanding media . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educational programming they had promised ; the logs he and his volunteers collected became the basis for F.C.C. hearings on educational programming on television. // // Despite the fact that churches have become more sophisticated in their approach to the broadcast media , Dr. Parker believes that too many religious agencies have failed to develop the broadcasting skills they need to plan effective local productions. // His own interest in local programming dates back to the mid-1940 ' s . By then , churches had glimpsed the possibilities of the broadcast media , and the young minister was named director of the Joint Religious Radio Committee , a group created by several Protestant denominations to train clergy and lay persons in broadcast skills and to provide programs for local stations . One of those programs , " All Aboard for Adventure , " in which children from around the world talked about their lives , was heard on more than 1 , 000 stations. // Churches readily took to Dr. Parker ' s creative programming , and his agency was soon producing shows for the fledgling television industry . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge trends in the industry , and when he was named director of the United Church of Christ communication office in 1954 , he made that concern a priority for his denomination. // // Dr. Parker ' s successor is Dr. Beverly Chain , who has already said she will continue the denomination ' s efforts to press for public-interest broadcasting . As for himself , he will become a senior research fellow and adjunct professor at the Rose Hill campus of the Fordham College of Arts and Sciences , pleased with some of the victories he has won but still worried about how broadcast media shape the ethics of the American people. // The years of struggle have not dimmed Dr. Parker ' s enthusiasm , and he says he intends to keep active in broadcasting matters . " The multiplication of channels of communication can provide every nation in the world with ample opportunities for people to exchange ideas , to receive and impart information , to grow in knowledge , and to express agreement with or to dissent from prevailing ideas , " he told the 1983 General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have their expression curtailed by the operators of the communication system . To break this control , to free the channels of communication - is a missionary imperative. " // //
