A few hours before his sister Shirley MacLaine won her Oscar , Warren Beatty brought her a gift . Or , rather , he left it at the office of her agent and asked that it be given to her in the car on the way to the ceremony . When she opened it , she started to cry . She recalls , " It was the most caring present I have ever received-very complicated , with many parts , five of which I have figured out the meaning of . It took him months of thought to put it together . " As she tells the story , she starts to sob again . Then she laughs . " I have asked Warren what the other parts mean , but he wo n't discuss anything personal . He is not incapable of reaching out , but he has to do it his way . " On hearing that his sister is still so deeply touched by his gesture , Warren grins . " Well , she sent me something nice when I won the Oscar , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gouges a symbolic boundary line across the table . " As for what goes on between Shirley and me , " he says , " you can safely call it complicated . " <P> It certainly seems to be . For MacLaine it is perhaps the most intense , enduring , unresolved and potentially explosive relationship in her life . She and Warren , who is three years younger , are intimate but often uneasy with each other . Says Warren : " Families are , after all , individual people , and manners were not invented for nothing . " They have disagreed over Shirley 's outspoken depiction in her books of family matters-including their father 's drinking and his views on race-that Warren feels may be misrepresented and better left unsaid . According to a friend , Shirley also outraged Warren a few years ago by making a joke about his love life on the Oscar telecast . They admire each other 's work , though hints of what sounds like rivalry slip in .

" Of their common craft , Shirley says wistfully , " Maybe I wanted him to need me more than he did . " Warren says of her book Out on a Limb : " My film Heaven Can Wait was sort of a precursor of what she wrote . " <P> As children , Shirley and Warren were together a great deal . " We went to the movies all the time , " he says , " and she was also quite an athlete . " Yet they have sharply differing recollections . Shirley depicts her father and mother as conservative and conventional . Warren contends that his parents were implicitly liberal on many matters , and that they raised him and Shirley with " a good , healthy , early feminist point of view . " Warren says it was apparent when Shirley was 16 or 17 that she would succeed in show business , and her swift rise was an influence in his choosing a performing career .

The realization seemed to come to her in that show that she was more interesting than her techniques as a dancer , about which she had always had a lot of anxieties .
