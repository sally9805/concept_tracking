Canadian-born Fred Lloyd Hartley , 68 , once proclaimed , " My life and my love is Unocal . " It is a love affair that goes back to May 1939 , when he graduated from the University of British Columbia and came to work at Union Oil , the forerunner of Unocal , as an engineering trainee at the Oleum refinery in San Francisco . He rose quickly through the executive ranks , and has served as chief executive since December 1964 . <P> It surprised few oil-industry watchers that Hartley , a man with a reputation for being as blunt and hard driving as a drilling rig , resisted with deep anger and tenacity T. Boone Pickens ' attempt to take over his company . Last April , when the two men met in a Washington corridor while waiting to testify about takeovers before the House Ways and Means Committee , Hartley refused to shake his adversary 's hand . This was no sporting contest ; this was war . <P> During the 13-week-long battle , Hartley directed or approved every strategic move . He met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lawyers and investment bankers in a 15- by 20-ft. windowless room furnished with a metal table and chairs and several chalkboards . " We would work for six to 15 hours at a time . Then Hartley would pop in and demand to know what we 'd come up with , " said one participant . After his victory , Hartley could scarcely conceal his glee : " This thing is going to keep me busy on the lecture circuit for years . If you want to hear my story , I 'll send you an invitation to one of my speeches . " One of his aides added , " It 'll cost you . " <P> In 1976 , Hartley suffered a heart attack , but he shows no signs of slowing down or thinking about retirement . In fact , shortly after his illness , he bought a 51-ft. yacht , which he named My Way .
