Donovan probe is reopened <P> Only seven weeks ago , when Special Prosecutor Leon Silverman released a 1,025-page report stating that there was " insufficient credible evidence " to prosecute the Labor Secretary , Raymond Donovan quickly declared that his troubles were over . Not quite . Silverman has reopened his investigation , and TIME has learned that he will present fresh allegations about Donovan 's conduct to grand juries in New York and elsewhere . <P> Phase II of the inquiry centers on the charge that Donovan , then part owner of New Jersey 's Schiavone Construction Co. , met near Miami in January 1979 with two known mobsters : William Masselli , a member of the Genovese Mafia family and head of an excavation firm that did business with Schiavone ; and Albert ( " Chink " ) Facchiano , a convicted loan shark and former capo ( captain ) in the Genovese clan . The purpose of the Miami get-together was reportedly to set up no-show jobs for Genovese Mob members on Schiavone construction sites . Although Donovan refused to comment on the new inquiry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He contends he had run into Masselli only about three times , always at job sites , and says he does not know Facchiano at all . <P> In the first probe , Silverman received so many reports about Donovan 's alleged conferences with mobsters in Miami that Facchiano , one of several gangsters mentioned in the allegations , escaped any questioning . Almost all the others had denied knowing the Labor Secretary , and Silverman says that summoning Facchiano then seemed pointless . But Facchiano , who is serving time in an Alabama prison for loan sharking , will now be called to testify . Silverman will also attempt to interrogate two men closely connected with Masselli who were not questioned during the first probe : Joseph Verlezza , an associate of Genovese gangsters , and Alfred Ditraglia , who watches over Masselli 's interests in the Miami area , including an oceanfront condominium . During the initial inquiry , Verlezza claimed he was too ill to testify ; Ditraglia could not be found by Silverman 's staff . <P> The FBI faces some tough questioning of its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Donovan 's confirmation probe 18 months ago . The personal files of FBI Director William Webster , forwarded to the committee last month , reveal that the name of Schiavone appeared several times in the bureau 's reports on the 1975 disappearance of former Teamster Boss Jimmy Hoffa . That detail would surely have intrigued both the Senate committee that approved Donovan 's nomination in February 1981 , and the special prosecutor this year . But neither learned about it until last month .
