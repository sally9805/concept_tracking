THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment COUNSEL for the defense rises . " My client may sometimes lose control of himself , " he tells the jury . " I admit that there is some probability that he will kill many innocent people if he returns to the streets . But look at the big picture . The victims he attacks at random are already exposed to risks , such as auto accidents and fires , that abound in daily life . Computer calculations show that my client 's occasional rampages will add very little , on the average , to the dangers we all face . Statistically speaking , you can not label him a major ' enemy of society . ' He 's just a run-of-the-mill public-safety hazard . Take off his shackles and set him free ! " So goes the line of argument that , while it is unlikely to persuade most juries , has steadily swayed the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission . The agency has ruled that the nation 's seventy-six commercial nuclear power plants , although susceptible to potentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To rationalize its decision , it has spent years performing computer studies on the probability - of serious accidents . Last month , the N.R.C. reached a milestone in this process of self-justification : it finally specified its notion of what " safe enough " really means . That was n't a problem for the N.R.C. 's predecessor , the Atomic Energy Commission , which simply dismissed the possibility of catastrophic accidents . According to the A.E.C. , the nuclear plants being built around the country were essentially risk-free . When it came to safety , " every possible precaution " was taken  --  so Glenn Seaborg , the A.E.C. chairman from 1961 to 1971 , asserted . The agency decreed that meltdown accidents were not " credible " events . In 1972 , to bolster the official optimism about safety , the A.E.C. launched its first accident-probability study . Headed by Professor Norman Rasmussen , of M.I.T. , and completed in 1975 under N.R.C. sponsorship , the study concluded that people faced more risk from falling meteorites than from nuclear-plant accidents . The scientific community immediately challenged these estimates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of data about many of the potential hazards . An independent review group appointed by the N.R.C. to settle the controversy concluded that the " arbitrariness " of some of the methods used in the Rasmussen report " boggles the mind . " Finally , in January of 1979 , the N.R.C. admitted that Rasmussen 's numerical estimates were not " reliable . " The Three Mile Island accident , a few months later , in which the reactor came within something between thirty and sixty minutes of a meltdown , reinforced that impression . The N.R.C. nevertheless persists in relying on what some of its leading safety advisers term " sham " estimates of accident probability ; that is , instead of ordering the hundreds of safety improvements recommended by its own experts after the Three Mile Island debacle the agency keeps doing calculations trying to prove that the risk of another major accident is low enough to ignore . Early last month , the N.R.C. carried its commitment to probability analysis one step further . It promulgated an official statement on " safety goals " ? a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency will permit the nuclear industry to take . Nuclear plants , the regulators suggested , will be judged acceptably safe and allowed to operate as long as the odds of meltdown accidents are kept within a certain limit : less than one meltdown per ten thousand reactor-years of operation . ( One reactor running for one year equals one reactor-year . ) What does this " safety goal " mean ? Assume , for example , that it is applied to the more than four hundred commercial reactors operating or under construction around the world today . It would take only about twenty-five years for them to accumulate ten thousand reactor-years of operation . The plants are designed to operate for a period of between thirty and forty years , so before the current nuclear units complete their useful service life at least one of them , under the N.R.C. 's criterion , would be allowed to have a meltdown . With a thousand reactors in operation , the N.R.C. standard would permit one meltdown a decade . The public , however , may be somewhat more squeamish . Depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fatalities and expose large numbers of people to long-term nuclear-radiation effects  --  mostly various forms of cancer . Even more disturbing than the N.R.C. 's definition of " safety goals " is the fact that many of the nuclear plants currently operating in the United States do not appear to meet them . The available statistics on the frequency of equipment breakdowns , operator errors , and other safety problems indicate that United States nuclear plants may he from five to ten times as likely to experience a meltdown as the tenthousand-reactor-year statistics suggest . According to one estimate  --  by N.R.C. scientists  --  there may be at least a fifty-per-cent chance of a meltdown in the United States during the coming decade , when a hundred reactors are expected to be in operation . In publishing its statement , the N.R.C. announced that it will he doing more calculations and refining its numerical " safety goals " during the next two years . Instead of working on this numerology , the N.R.C. might consider doing something useful about meltdown-accident risks , such as ordering nuclear-plant operators to get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . ? ? Police Exam " W ARNING ... There is to be NO SMOKING anywhere in the building , " stated " Test Instructions for Candidates , " a brochure handed to each of the thousand or so young men and women who assembled one recent Saturday afternoon at Brooklyn 's Canarsie High School to take the exam that might someday allow them to join the New York City Police Department . " You will please not smoke in the building . No smoking , " intoned the matronly woman  --  a home-ec teacher , we decided  --  who was collecting admission tickets . " No SMOKING , " several hallway signs emphasized . Still , each time the door to the second-floor boy 's ' room opened , a dense cloud of smoke , like the ones in paintings of Civil War battles , issued forth . Inside , a large number of lit-up young men  --  from high-school age through the mid-twenties  --  discussed police salaries , uniform allowances , civil-service hiring procedures , and the Islanders . Eventually , a proctor wandering the halls stuck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to report to their assigned classrooms . The test , being administered that day to thirty-seven thousand young people at thirty-five high schools around the city , was about to start . There was considerable filling out of forms , and then the home-ec teacher handed out copies of a booklet with two line drawings of neighborhoods on the wrong side of town . The candidates stared at each drawing for five minutes and tried to complete from memory a series of statements like " The license plate number of the car is  --  " and " The person just inside the door of the diner is best described as having a  - -  -  . " The memory questions , fourteen in all , were stompers ; we 'll never hesitate to ask a cop for directions . The test proper  --  a hundred and twenty-six written questions  --  followed , and it was a good deal simpler . Some of the questions tested the ability to follow orders , but many seemed to be searching for the ability to write reports in chronological sequence . Some were of this variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity near the entrance to Madison Square Garden during a recent rock concert . The report will contain the following five sentences : I As I came closer to the man , he placed what appeared to be tickets in his pocket and began to walk away . 2 . After the man stopped , I questioned him about " scalping " tickets . .3 . While on assignment near the Madison Square Garden entrance . I observed a man apparently selling tickets . 4 . I stopped the man by stating that I was a Police Officer . 5 . The man was then given a summons and he left the area . The most logical order for the above sentences to appear in the report is : The exam also included a map to see if the candidates , put behind the wheel of a prowl car , would be able to find their way from , say , Desert Boulevard to Eagle Street without turning east on London Street and causing an extensive pileup .

Two hours , and eighty-odd questions ( including a section that required identification of suspects who had altered their appearance , and one of whom looked suspiciously like Mother Teresa ) , later , most of the test-takers were done . The strapping young men  --  and some young women  --  who had been hunched over their computerized answer sheets most of the afternoon filtered slowly out of the high school , joking and boasting and admitting when they were asked that they would dearly like to be cops . " That 's twenty thousand dollars a year to start . ' That 's good money . And if you 're a cop people got to look up to you , " said one .

And perhaps not . The luncheonette down the street from Canarsie High School carried the Nees on a rack out front , and the headline that led the paper that Saturday was " KOCH THREATENS 6,000 LAYOFFS . " Crisis WE ran into a woman on her way home from a midlife crisis the other day . It was Janet . " You should 've been there , " she told us from the far side of a puddle of slush . " They called it a Midlife Fair , and it was put on by the Midlife Institute of Marymount Manhattan College , for women in their middle years . To find out if it 's for you , you start counting from one . It 's the years somewhere between one and a hundred . " Janet poked at the slush with a spiked metal cane . From the curb , we reached out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of workshops in the morning , " she continued while poking . " One workshop was Financial Planning . I did n't go to that one ; I spend it before I can plan how to use it . I should 've worn my rubber boots . " Janet reached into her coat pocket for a flyer . We watched helplessly as she was narrowly missed by a cab on radio call . She examined the flyer . " Then , there was Coping with Elderly ' Parents , " she said . " I think that means if they 're alive . One workshop was called What Will I Do with the Rest of My Life , which I told them ought to be What Will I Do with the Rest of My Life . " Plunging the cane again , she made her curb . " In the elevator going up , I announced that I was the oldest mid3 " This is our collection of miniatures.11 dle-aged person there . Going down , there were two women older than me . It was very enlightening . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for a minute ? " We took the cane . " I made a lot of notes , " Janet said , pulling a wad of papers from her bag . " At the first workshop , the lady said you have to have self-confidence . ' You do n't go to pieces if the right person gives you the wrong look . ' What does that mean , I wonder . Oh , values ! Values was the most important thing . " Janet put on a pair of reading glasses and studied her notes . " The same lady said that she 's particularly interested in women ' because I am one . ' Nobody objected . " We propped the cane up in a snow-bank . " You have to look inside yourself and you find out a lot of stuff about who you are , " Janet continued , " What your values are , what 's important to you in life . I missed the next few sentences . Then she explained that we all have a lot of conflict ? ' mutually exclusive needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' A lot of women want power , success , and sta tus , and also desire a marriage and family . ' Then we were given some tests  --  two tests . One was called Work Satisfactions . You were supposed to mark yourself either one , which was very important , ' or two , which was reasonably important , ' or three , ' not very important , ' or four , ' not important . ' " Janet looked up . " I gave myself a one for altruism , " she said , " and a four for precision work . I put down a three for stability . The lady next to me , by the way , who was completely opposite to me in every respect , filled out her test almost the same . She was taller , younger , and had a wonderful marriage , and we both scored ourselves high on altruism and low on making money . For the other test , you 're allowed four thousand dollars to bid on things like ' being of service , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' ' contributing to world betterment . ' I bid two thousand two hundred on that , but somebody won who bid two thousand five hundred . I also bid two thousand on being of service . Somebody else bid her entire four thousand on making a lot of money . I won something for three hundred dol lars ? ' working under time pressures ' ? because nobody else hid and I got stuck with it . The test was called Values Auction . " We felt the ice melting under our feet and seeping into our boots . " Then we went to a class called Relationships with Grown Daughters , " Janet said . " A psychoanalyst ran that , and she asked questions like What discipline are you from ? ' I could n't think of any . She said , ' We 've all been daughters , ' which was pretty profound , and I asked what happens if you have a rotten role model . She said something about ' does n't matter  --  depends on your maturity . ' I do n't agree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whom she takes care of now , still criticizes the way she fixes her hair and what she wears . When she leaves , she feels like a ten-year-old , and she has to remind herself that she 's a grandmother . I got up and told a story about when my kid was a senior at college . She called me up long-distance and reversed the charges , and she said to me , ' You never gave me any sense of direction . ' And I said , ' How could I never had any myself . ' I told the class that I said , ' Everything rotten and lousy that 's happened to you up to this point is your mother 's fault . From now on , you 're on your own , ' and 1 hung up . I had to add , however , that I did n't stick to it . Then we all went and had lunch with Betty Furness . What did she say ? " Janet consulted her notes . " You should not lie about anything except one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Janet reported . " She called on me to speak ? ' You in the red blouse with your hand up ' and I told her that I did n't agree with her , that women had to lie about their age in America . I once asked a man who knows my right age for a job , and he said , ' We retire people at your age . ' Everyone laughed at this tragedy . Betty Furness also said , ' Do n't take no for an answer . ' Years ago , I was trying to get a job with Orson Welles in Paris , and he said , ' She 'll probably get it , because I 'm gon na keep saying no till I get laryngitis , and nobody 'll hear me , and she 'll end up working for me . ' So I did get the job . Actually , for days I did n't know what the job was . I just sat at rehearsals , until one of the actresses got sick , and he said , ' O.K. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I was the understudy . I got on and did n't know any of the lines ; I just stood there . ' The Unthinking Lobster ' I think was the name of that show . I was very good . It was referred to as ' the Janet version . ' " Janet pulled her cane out of the snowbank and began to inch along the sidewalk . We followed . " I 'm afraid of slipping , " she said . " This ice cane was given to me after I had an accident last year . Yesterday , Mr. Marascino , from the I.R.S. , called and asked me to get my papers together . I told him that I threw everything , especially unopened bills and envelopes from the I.R.S. , also unopened , into these brown bags and cartons . He was aghast . The bottom drawer of my bureau is full of those unpleasant things  --  dispossess notices , disconnect notices , messages from the I.R.S. , and bank statements . He was supposed to find out why I had n't filed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had filed for one of those years .

So I began looking through a huge hunch of checks , and I found a five-hundreddollar check made out to ' Internal Revenue . ' At the bottom , where it says FEBRUARY 28,1983 for , ' I had written ' gift . ' When I told him , he said , ' What does that mean  --  gift ? ' I said , ' Well , what would you call it ?

On July 17 , 1981 , at about three-thirty in the morning , at the tail end of a lunar eclipse , he landed a seventy-six-pound Morove saxatilis , which at that time was the largest striped bass ever taken . The catch got his name in the papers and in the record hook , and it gave him a story to tell whenever he 's waiting for a nibble . But it did n't get him any two hundred and fifty thousand dollars , and that is why , in money-in-the-bank terms , Bob Rocchetta was not lucky at all , and why , when we approached him during a noonday reception at the Explorers Club last week , the first thing he said was " The guy you want is in the other room . " See , not long after Rocchetta 's record catch , the ABU-Garcia fishing-supplies company announced a quarter-milliondollar prize for the next record striper , arid that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McReynolds , on September 21st of last year , while standing on a moss-slick Atlantic City jetty , fought with and triumphed over a bass that weighed seventy-eight and a half pounds .

" When I was a little boy , I was wading and I cut my foot , and my father always said that instead . of losing blood I took in salt water . That 's why I am what I am . " Mr. Rocchetta , his sturdy frame wrapped in a red fishing jacket , blended in with the Explorers Club decor , which is dominated by a stuffed polar bear , SaErip/al Ca ) 1,1 BED krilt4 FRANNY FRE ? ? an authentic dogsled , and many paintings of men killing fauna .

The only incongruous touch is a large sign in one room reading " OCCUPANCY BY MORE THAN 130 PERSONS IS DANGEROUS AND UNLAWFUL . " Surely a little matter of illegality , to say nothing of peril , would n't faze an Explorer ! Anyway , we met a number of people , all connected with the bass in one way or another , who were standing among the various artifacts sipping drinks and chewing on raw vegetables . They included : Stephen Topping , the sports editor of the American edition of the " Guinness Book of World Records , " who told us that McReynolds and his bass would be listed not only for the largest of the species ever caught but also  --  most likely  --  for the most valuable single fish in history . " The **36;6938;TOOLONG prize would seem to push it past a Japanese carp that we currently list , whose owner turned down an offer of a hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars for him , " Mr. Topping said . " It 's a living carp . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and twenty-three pounds of the finest caviar . Even liberally estimated , at five hundred dollars a pound , that 's still only about a hundred and sixty thousand dollars . " Tom Conlon , the president of the D. L. Blair Corporation , which ABU-Garcia hired to establish that McReynolds and the bass came by each other honestly . " We also handle a lot of the magazine sweepstakes . And Zingo , in the Daily News  --  that 's ours , too , " Mr. Conlon said . Mr. McReynolds had been " required to keep the fish frozen until his claim was proved , " Mr. Conlon explained , adding , " I 'd rather not go into all the criteria we used ; some are very subtle  --  almost trade secrets . But our obligation to our clients  --  and to the world  --  is to make sure no fraud is perpetrated . And in this case we have no doubts . " Mr. Conlon also confided that his company ran across relatively few cheats . " It really pleases me to say that most people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ABU-Garcia , who told us his firm was " very , very pleased " to give Mr. McReynolds two hundred and fifty thousand dollars , even though he caught his bass using equipment made by another manufacturer . And Jim Brosnan , the correspondent covering the affair for Westchester Cable Television , who is almost fifteen , is in the ninth grade , and weighs only about half again as much as Mr. McReynolds ' bass . Mr. Brosnan , who used notes from his mother and a Mr. Champagne , a Westchester Cable official , to persuade the authorities at his school to release him , is an important part of " Mark Sabia Sports Log , " which has been running for a while in much of Westchester but has only recently been pipc ! into White Plains , and which may someday be called " Jim Brosnan Sports Log . " Mr. Brosnan and his colleagues also produce " Ham and Beyond , " a cable show about amateur radio and other electronic equipment . After the cocktails , there was lunch ( striped bass ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he described how he hooked the fish ( " I was holding the rod , and the Lord put the fish on my hook " ) , how he battled the fish , how he wrapped the fish up in a beach blanket , and how he then proceeded to fish for six more hours ( " The fish were still hitting " ) . Mr. Corky Campbell was given a check for twenty-five thousand dollars , because Mr. McReynolds had registered for the contest at his bait shop . Mr. Campbell told about the scene that followed the weigh-in of the bass at his store . " Holy mackerel ! " he said , unsurprisingly . " We had it hanging out front , and it was almost like it was a holy occurrence . People were coming up and touching the fish . They were bringing their children . " Mr. Rocchetta was also given a chance to speak , and he told the crowd , " You 're probably asking yourself , ' What 's so special about striped bass ? ' Well , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally catch one , it 's sort of like meeting that certain someone . "
