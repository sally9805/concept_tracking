Whether or not the anticipated cease-fire between President Corazon Aquino and the New People 's Army holds , one thing is clear . The New Armed Forces of the Philippines have ' emerged from the chaos of the past month as the pre-eminent arbiter of events , with an institutional power unmatched even in the Marcos years . And the price that Chief of Staff Gen. Fidel Ramos exacts is likely to include many of the demands made by former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile . After nine months of the Aquino presidency , what began as theater. on an epic scale is settling imp. the familiar . contours of an ' American. ; morality play . The cast of characters risks being stripped down to meet the mquirements of a simon-pure conflict between democracy " and " communism . " The complex personality of the Philippine left and People Power will be made to appear one-dimensional , and Washington will renew its love affair with that enduring fantasy , " clean counterinsurgency . " That fantasy originally took root in the Philippines . The Huk rebellion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textbook , and it was in that conflict that Aquino 's new Defense Minister , Rafael Ileto , won his spurs . The Philippine military , as former Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus once commented , is " the most U.S.-oriented army in the world . " Its West Point credentials , however , are the problem , not the solution . And the dismissal of Enrile , himself a Harvard man , no more solves the problem than the sacking of Lieut . Col. Oliver North sanitizes U.S. policy in Nicaragua . Cory Aquino 's electoral mandate , as well as her personal inclinations , lie in the direction of democratic reform , not of clean counterinsurgency . The question is whether her chorus of backers in Washington can tell the difference . SITTING DOWN WITH SATAN WHY IRAN PURSUED THE ARMS DEAL DILIP HIRO Just as U.S. planes were bombing Libya in mid-April in retribution for Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi 's alleged sponsorship of terrorism , President Ronald Reagan 's top officials were discussing a secret arms-for-hostages deal with Iran , which they had also designated a " terrorist state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McFarlane flew to Teheran on a plane loaded with U.S.-made weapons and ? pare parts . His four:day 's ortalks4ith low-levsel Iranian officials are now described . as having been fruitlesss However , during May and June , . according to the Danish Seamen 's . Union , the Danish cargo ship Else-HT carried at least 3,600 tons of military materials , mainly U.S.-made , in four ' journeys between Eilat , Israel , and Bandar Abbas , Iran . On July 26 , the Rev. Lawrence Jenco was released in Lebanon by the pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad . Apparently negotiations on the principle of arms for hostages were continuing . According to Abolhassan Bani-Sadr , the first President of the Islamic Republic of Iran , three days after the McFarlane trip two U.S. C-130 transport planes arrived in Iran from Clark Air Base in the Philippines carrying spare parts for the F-4 , F-5 and F-14 fighters used by the Iranian Air Force .

The Cover-Up Begins T he Reagan Administration 's stunning admission of mismanagement , incompetence and perhaps criminality in the conduct of an incoherent and im- moral foreign policy provides a dramatic climax to the first phase of the crisis that now grips Washington . At the same time it marks the beginning of the next one : the cover-up has begun . What did the President know of the complicated arms deal with Iran , and when did he knowthat the Israelis were depositing profits from arms sales in Nicaraguan contra , accounts ? If he did not know , why did n't he ? And why was the nation 's number-one law-enforcement official making the revelations anyway ? In the course of a masterly , evasive attempt at damage control , Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said Reagan was in the dark " because no one told him . " Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President a mere figurehead ? Is he just stupid , and thus guilty of malfeasance ; or is he stonewalling , and thus guilty of felonious disregard of Congress and a candidate for impeachment ? Reagan has been lying , misremembering and oversimplifying for years , without serious reproach . High- , middle-and low-level Administration offiCiaIs have been fired , forced to resign , prosecuted , indicted , imprisoned and rehabilitated in an unprecedented tide of impropriety ( at last count , the record stood at 184 charged or investigated since 1981 ) , without much tarnish accruing to the Reagan presidency . Others connected with the National Security Council have been forced out before Vice Adm . John Poindexter and Lieut . Col. Oliver North . It was not that no one knelkr about the sleaze but that no one cared , at least no one in the hegemonized media and the political mainstream . The importance of the growing cloud now over the White House is that it has for the first time delegitimized the President 's authority and opened the way for investigation , criticism and opposition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteries of the political culture . Certainly the original arms deal was n't so outrageous , as against the covert-turned-overt war in Central America , the sandbagging of nuclear disarmament or the extension of an effective alliance with the apartheid regime in South Africa  --  all of which have passed without much fuss . But what the deal showed about the Administration  --  its ineptitude , its hypocrisy and its dangerous deceptions  --  made all the difference in the projection of its authority . " Iran " is becoming something like " Watergate , " which is to say that it describes a pattern of political behavior that is under attack more than a particular project or policy . Such scandals have a cascade effect , much like the unforeseen train of events that multiply after a minor accident to cause some nuclear or ecological disaster . Reagan wo n't be brought down as easily a.s Nixon , , but there are many layers of : wrongdoing to peel away before the presidential image can be restored to its previous state . It is already possible to see how the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture . The Meese patrol , which has felt a bit left out of the glory in the past year , is using the crisis to subvert the reign of those Reagan advisers who think the world ends on January 20 , 1989 , when they are due to retire . The Bush battalion is obviously torn between the demands of loyalty and the wisdom of detachment ; they are bound to choose the wrong direction . The Democrats are so excited at the sight of first blood that they have not settled on a consistent line of opposition or a theory of the crisis , and that failure may rob them of the advantage they should have when the cascade finally ends . The greatest danger is that Reagan will do what he is best at , which is to divert attention from failure by making a dramatic gesture of the military kind  --  witness the Caribbean coup after the Lebanese loss . The Nicaraguans are on the alert , and no doubt Colonel Qaddafi is battening down for another assault . The holiday season is the traditional time for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Vietnam at Christmas in 1972 in lieu of peace negotiations . But what may save us , and Reagan 's NEXT WEEK William Tabb on Ivan Boesky H. Laurence Ross and Graham Hughes on Drunk Driving potential victims , from the fire this time is the paralysis that so far is the most beneficial effect of the trouble in the White House . If the warmakers are not fighting with one another , and the Commander in Chief himself is under siege , the world may have a short season of respite . Contra Conscience 0 n October 24 , President Reagan signed into law a $100 million aid package to the Nicaraguan contras . It includes $70 million in military assistance and $30 million in economic aid , of which $3 million is earmarked for " strengthening of programs and activities of the Nicaraguan Democratic Resistance for the observance and advancement of human rights . " This is not the first time Congress tried , to purchase improvements in the contras ' human rights performance . In June 1985 the United Nicaraguan Opposition ( UNO ) announced the.creation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its operations . The State Department blanched at the size of the request , and in the end provided approximately $175,000 . In an interview published in The New York Times on August 23 , 1985 , UNO leader Arturo Cruz declared : " We are going to report on prisoners that are taken . We have to stop summary executions , whether among our own people for disciplinary reasons or among the enemy . The leadership of UNO has to go and discuss this with the commanders . " UNO 's Commission on Human Rights , known as UNO/C.D.H. , never fulfilled the role envisioned by Cruz . It produced lengthy testimony about Sandinista abuses but did little to investigate , prosecute or punish abuses by the contras . One particularly well-documented instance of contra abuse occurred on August 2 , 1985 , just after the creation of UNO/C.D.H . Ten disarmed Sandinista soldiers and a school watchman were abducted in front of dozens of people in the town of Cuapa and then murdered . The killings were reported in The Washington Post and Los Angeles Times and investigated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which monitors both the Nicaraguan government and the contras . They were a clear breach of Geneva Conventions standards on the treatment of captured prisoners of war , and therefore presented a critical test case for UNO/C.D.H . The commission did not investigate the incident , much less take disciplinary action against those responsible . Six months after the massacre its staff had not even interviewed the contra officer who commanded the troops at Cuapa , a man known as Dumas . There was a grotesque postscript to the massacre : on November 6 , 1985 , President Reagan told Congress that the victims had been killed ' in a battle and that their corpses had been mutilated by the Sandinistas to substantiate a false charge of contra atrocities . Since July Americas Watch has been asking the commission to provide information on contra violations of human rights that have been prosecuted and punished . UNO/ C.D.H. provided a list prepared by Carlos Icaza , prosecutor for the Nicaraguan Democratic Force ( F.D.N. ) , the main contra military faction . Icaza 's report described fourteen cases of alleged human rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contra offenses against other contras , and three were crimes relating to property , including armed theft and the sale of drugs . Only one case , involving the rape of two young girls , could be considered a violation of human rights . Not a single case of the killing , torture or kidnapping of civilians or captured Sandinista soldiers had been prosecuted . Nonetheless , the Reagan Administration cited these fourteen cases in his November 1985 report to Congress , which required the President to report on " alleged human rights violations by the Nicaraguan democratic resistance . . . including a statement of the steps taken by the Nicaraguan democratic resistance to remove from their ranks any individuals who have engaged in human rights abuses . " So far , no additional F.D.N. prosecutions or punishments in this area have been reported . Although they had only one human rights case to show for it , UNO/C.D.H. managed to spend a full $175,000 of U.S. aid before the contra leadership shut down the office this summer . According to Senator Dave Durenberger , chair of the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UNO/ C.D.H. in early August and refused to pay the employees $65,000 in back salary . A high-ranking contra official told Time in ' August that Bermitdez and UNO leader Adolfo Calero had made the decision . " They fail to understand the importance of it , ' ' he said . The infusion of $3 million for human rights activities has apparently straightened out the misunderstanding . UNO has now lesurrected its human rights office and has appointed Marta Patricia Baltodano to head it . Baltodato had been associated with the anti-Sandinista Permanent Commission on Human Rights in NicarSgua . By providing UNO/C.D.H. with a face lift , she risks her reputation as a serious monitor of human rights . The commission 's performance in monitoring contra abuses , its failure to denounce violations when they occur and its near-complete inability to prosecute , and punish contra offenders reflects the irrelevance of UNO 's civilian leadership . Since the creation of UNO/C.D.H. contra abuses'have proliferated . Noncombatants have been killed , roads that are heavily traveled by civilians have been mined , and captured soldiers have been executed . UNO/C.D.H. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with reorganization will come a serious effort to monitor and publicize contra abuses and prosecute those responsible . The lesson for Congress is that $3 million worth of ingenuously appropriated conscience money will neither buy effective monitoring of contra human rights abuses nor transform the practices of the contras and their commanders . HOLLY BURKHALTER Two Cheers , - Nader 's pursuit of product and environmental safety , Congressional reform and safeguards against workplace injuries has helped organize constituencies powerful enough to withstand and now terminate the Reagan revolution . As President Reagan said of Senator Jeremiah Denton : - the man is a national treasure . Then there is Michael Pertschuk , who as Federal Trade Commission chair under Jimmy Carter and as disSident-inresidence during Reagan 's first three years in office , offended the cigarette , advertisirig , breakfast cereal and television industrits . As he recalls in his amiable and highly instructive book , Giantkillers , it is possible for adroit public interest lobbyists to_the defeat corporate opponents at their own lavishly financed game , even when We political winds blow far right . Who would have thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genuinely scary warnings on its advertisements ? For radicals who operate at high levels of abstraction , Pertschuk is a guide to the way things get done in Washington . His new Washington Advocacy Institute aims to teach the ill-organized armies of the virtuous the skills of legislative persuasion . American politics is both more open and more volatile than radicals self-indulgently enveloped in gloom are usually prepared to admit . Last month 's electoral follies reaffirmed my heroes ' points : money does n't always buy power ; Reagan is not invincible ; good candidates can unseat bad incumbents . Nader , Pertschuk and their co-workers are major sources of the new ideas and new legislative vehicles for which a resurgent liberalism will soon , I hope , be clamoring- . In the meantime , let 's hear it for two authentic heroes of the left ? Ralph Nader and Michael Pertschuk . Long may they continue to give fits to corporate America .
