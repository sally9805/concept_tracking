Archibald MacLeish : 1892-1982 <P> In 1923 , when Archibald MacLeish was 31 and practicing law in Boston ( and moonlighting as TIME 's first education writer at $10 a week ) , he abruptly abandoned income and respectability to take his family off to Paris . His passionate determination , he said , was " to write the poems I wanted to write and not the poems I was writing . " Last week , when he died at 89 in Boston , MacLeish 's 40-odd volumes of poetry , plays and commentary had won official rewards ranging from honorary doctorates ( Columbia , Dartmouth , the University of Illinois ) to three Pulitzer Prizes ( 1932 , 1953 , 1959 ) to the Presidential Medal of Freedom ( 1977 ) . Yet the conflicts between what he wrote and what he wanted to write remained forever unresolved . <P> In France , where he had served as an artilleryman during World War I , MacLeish spent five years among the expatriates of the Lost Generation , and from this came a number of rather conventional but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flight of birds , " ran the most celebrated one , " Ars Poetica . " " A poem should not mean/ But be . " But larger ideas were stirring . MacLeish went to Mexico to write the epic of Cortez , and Conquistador won him a Pulitzer for 1932 . But by then there were other demands on his talent . <P> When President Hoover declared that nobody had actually starved to death in the worsening Depression , MacLeish wrote an impassioned refutation in FORTUNE , where he was a founding writer . It was his mission , as he saw it , to speak out on all contemporary causes : for Roosevelt 's New Deal , for the Spanish Republic , against the spread of Nazism . " The victories of tyrants and the resistance of peoples halfway around the world , " he wrote in 1939 , " are as near as the ticking of the clock on the mantel . " <P> He acted in effect as Roosevelt 's minister of culture . Officially , he became Librarian of Congress in 1939 , assistant director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secretary of State in 1944 . And when the war ended , MacLeish headed the U.S. delegation to the founding of UNESCO . <P> The poetry that MacLeish kept producing during these years acquired a solemnly official ring . Land of the Free , written to accompany a series of Dust Bowl photographs , purported to record the unspoken questionings of the People ; America Was Promises urged the same People to demand their rights ( " Listen ! Brothers ! . . . / Companions of leaves : of the sun " ) . These symphonic musings inspired Edmund Wilson to malicious parody : " And the questions and/ Questions/ questioning What am I ? O/ What shall I/ remember ? . . . / Till the hearer cried : / ' If only MacLeish could remember if only could say it ! ' " <P> The coming of the cold war soured the old idealism . " Freedom that was a thing to use/ They 've made a thing to save , " MacLeish wrote bitterly in Brave New World ( 1948 ) , " And staked it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " An appointment to teach English at Harvard in 1949 removed the poet from the public arena . A kindly man , he found that he liked instructing the young and that they liked him . In later years , MacLeish turned toward a new questioning of fundamentals . From the ancient paradoxes of Job he created J.B. , which ran for ten months on Broadway in 1958-59 and brought him the most resounding praises of his career .
