LAS VEGAS , Nev.  --  Electronics makers are beset by the weakened dollar , rising competition and doubts about consumer confidence . Sales growth is slowing , profits are shrinking . And no new blockbuster product is in sight as the market for videocassette recorders matures . But the industry has countless new ways to tempt buyers . A walk through the Winter Consumer Electronics Show , which ended here yesterday , yielded this sampler : Picture telephones may finally catch on , in simpler form . The first ones  --  by American Telephone &; Telegraph Co.  --  flopped in the 1960s , partly because they couldn ' t work with ordinary telephone lines ; their TV-like pictures required more capacity . AT &; later developed a form of picture phone for business meetings , but it was too cumbersome and costly for consumers . Now Mitsubishi Electric Corp. of Japan has begun selling VisiTel , a telephone accessory that uses a built-in camera to send still pictures over ordinary lines . The user sits in front of the camera , frames a picture on a small video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five or six seconds later , to the VisiTel on the other end of the line . Retail price : about $399 each . An earlier , fancier model  --  for offices  --  has been on the market for a couple of years , at nearly three times the price of the new version.  --  - " Three-dimensional " videotapes now can be shot at home on new camcorders . Conventional 3-D movies involve a double image , in two different colors , to fool eyes outfitted with special glasses . Now Toshiba Corp. of Japan offers a form of 3D : The new camcorders yield two separate pictures  --  one for each eye . Again , a form of 3-D glasses is required . The camcorder , along with the glasses and a necessary electronic adaptor , will be available in May . But home horror buffs might shriek at the price : about $2 , 800.  --  - Loud ties are disturbing enough : Now hear the " Sonic Jacket . " The jacket , which comes in various fabrics and colors , is especially designed for bopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amplifier are built in , at shoulder and chest levels . Wires run to a pocket , where a radio or tape player ( not included ) can be stashed . This $199 Toshiba product , available in the U.S. soon , will provide an alternative to headphones , which are an inconvenience or a hazard to some people . And  --  now here ' s the good news  --  it allows the sound to be shared , at no charge , by everybody in the vicinity.  --  - This new gadget facilitates computer use in the home . It ' s Spectrum AC ( for alternating current ) , a new type of modem that allows data to be transmitted at high speed over the standard electrical wiring in homes . Computers and accessories wouldn ' t need to have special cables connecting them , making it easier to move them between rooms without clumsy rewiring . NEC Corp. of Japan says the product will be available in the U.S. later this year , probably retailing below $300 . Since at least two modems are needed  --  one at each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600 to the cost of a home system . NEC notes that Spectrum ' s uses " might also include the control of a popcorn popper , coffee percolator or shower adjustment from any room within 200 meters. "  --  - Portable VCRs appear , with everything shrunk but the cost . One Casio Computer Co. model , available in April at a list price of $1 , 399 , plays standard VHS tapes on a tiny ( 3. 3-inch-diagonal ) liquid-crystal screen . Weight : about seven pounds.  --  - As if kitchens weren ' t crowded enough , here come bread-baking machines . First to hit the U.S. , late last year , was the Panasonic Bread Bakery ( about $329 ) , from Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan . Next will be the Incredible Bread Machine ( about $349 ) , imported from Japan by Welbilt Corp . , New Hyde Park , N.Y. About as simple to use as a popcorn popper , a bread machine mixes and shapes ingredients and then bakes them in about four hours.  --  - If your camcorder is no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japan is selling a $299 screen that sits atop Hitachi ' s camcorders , for instant replay of newly shot tapes . The screen , which is 2. 7 inches diagonally , is bigger than the viewfinder , and has sound . Taking a cue from the still-camera market , makers aim to squeeze more money from camcorder users with a host of tripods , mounting devices , carrying cases and the like.  --  - High-end TV sets proliferate  --  for both projection and regular models . Hitachi alone has four models of regular television sets and six projection TVs with prices over $2 , 000 . One of the new models is a 50-inch-diagonal projection set  --  so large that a second picture can be viewed on a 13-inch-diagonal " picture within a picture . " Retailer Jack Luskin of Baltimore-based Luskin ' s Inc. , says the set  --  which is two feet deep  --  is much less bulky than previous models . Suggested retail price : $3 , 500 . Meanwhile , Mr. Luskin and others note a shortage of low-priced sets as more suppliers move upscale. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t require housebreaking . Spike has mink and angora skin , brass legs and sterling-silver toenails . He can talk in 128 different computer-generated voices . He isn ' t for sale ; his job is to greet conventioneers at the booth of Phonetica One Inc. , a small Colorado City , Colo. , company . But Phonetica says it can make anybody a similar toy  --  with a " quick wit , Martian-like voice and real-life movements . " Unearthly price : about $18 , 000 . " Media rooms " for the home get a bigger push . Media rooms are seen by some manufacturers and retailers as a way to get more money out of people who aren ' t flocking to any one blockbuster product . So they team up and try to get consumers to buy a total package . First , they say , you need a room about 14 feet wide and 18 feet long , if not larger . Next , you need equipment from , say , seven different suppliers : a large screen , seven loudspeakers , an amplifier , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turntable . And then you need a lot of money . A relatively inexpensive media room was set up here by Fosgate Inc. , a Heber City , Utah , maker of sound processors , and Barco Electronic N.V. of Belgium , a maker of video projectors . They figure a consumer could replicate the room for $15 , 000 to $18 , 000 . Other suppliers say some people are spending more than $100 , 000 on media rooms . " These aren ' t audiophiles or videophiles , " says David Daniels , a Tulsa , Okla. , retailer . " They ' re wealthy people who want to watch football .
