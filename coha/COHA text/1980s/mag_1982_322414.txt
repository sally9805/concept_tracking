Hypnotic and infectious , minimalism is emotional in its appeal <P> <P> The mood at the concert was growing ugly . The audience had divided into two warring camps . Some listeners yelled for the music to stop , others called for it to continue . Umbrellas were brandished menacingly . Cheers and catcalls grew so noisy that the musicians had to count aloud to keep their places . One distressed listener , unable to contain her emotions any longer , jumped from her seat , ran down the aisle and pounded on the stage . " I ca n't stand it any longer ! " she screamed at the startled performers . <P> The riotous Paris premiere of Stravinsky 's The Rite of Spring in 1913 ? The hostile demonstration in Vienna that prevented the first performance of two of Alban Berg 's Altenberg Lieder a couple of months earlier ?

Minimalism , a joyous , exciting-and sometimes maddening-amalgam of influences as disparate as African drumming , the Balinese gamelan and new wave rock , has come uptown at last . <P> With its short , catchy melodic fragments , simple chordal harmonies , rock-steady rhythms and virtually trance-inducing repetitions , the minimalist music of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and John Adams , 35 , is directly emotional in its appeal , a deliberate rebuke to three decades of arid , overly intellectualized music produced by the post-war avantgarde .
