A certain step has been made in establishing a dialogue between our two countries . <P>  --  Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko , on leaving Geneva Wednesday morning <P> This week 's meeting in Geneva , while only a single step , is the beginning of a new dialogue between the United States and the Soviet Union . <P>  --  President Reagan , at his news con ference in Washington Wednesday night <P> It was surely the first time that Gromyko and Reagan had felt disposed to echo each other .

Nonetheless , said Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle , a member of Shultz 's team , " if the final session Tuesday afternoon had ended on schedule ( at 5 p.m. ) , the conference would have failed . " Even after the delegations went into overtime , says another American official , no one could be certain that a deal would be struck " until five minutes before it finally happened , " at 7:30 p.m. on Tuesday .
