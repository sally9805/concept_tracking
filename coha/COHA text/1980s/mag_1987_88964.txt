The guy in the bleachers shouting " Amazing ! Beauty ! Unbelievable ! " and waving a New York Liberties pennant knows why he goes to Major League Volleyball games . " I love tall women . " says 63-year-old John DeNitto of Uniondale , N.Y. , who is 5 ' 2 ? " and as compact as a bowling ball . By this , DeNitto did not intend to slight his 5 ' 1 ? " wife , Helen , who is seated beside him in a yellow Liberties T-shirt . " Helen ca n't stretch the way these tall girls do , " John says . " Amazing ! Unbelievable ! " // Perhaps not as unbelievable as the fact that on a night in April the DeNittos and 384 other fans paid between $6 and $18 to watch the Liberties lose to the San Francisco/ San Jose Golddiggers in four sets at Hofstra University . That anybody showed up at Hofstra University Physical Fitness Arena is amazing in itself . Before the MLV moved a team there , Uniondale , Long Island , had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to serve up the sport to paying customers was made by the International Volleyball Association , a coed outfit started in 1975 that , at one point during its brief life span , employed Wilt Chamberlain as its commissioner . The IVA was spiked after five seasons of anonymity . // Typical of the way the old league carried on business was the Tucson franchise 's President Carter Could n't Make It Tonight Night , which featured free admission to all uncles named Sam ( provided a paying niece or nephew was in tow ) , half-price admission for all military personnel and for fans with patriotic tattoos , and a promise that Jimmy Carter would n't attend . " Our money is better spent elsewhere , " says Steve Arnold , commissioner of the all-women MLV . " Our total budget is less than Don Mattingly 's annual salary " ( which is $1.975 million ) . // Arnold , a former players ' agent , has also been involved as a principal in the World Football League , World Hockey Association , World Team Tennis , the ABA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league Arnold has n't had a hand in is the League of Nations . He got the idea for the volleyball league in 1984 after watching the U.S. women 's team win a silver medal in the final game of the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles . Arnold persuaded seven California investors to underwrite the six-team venture . ( The cities are Minneapolis/St . Paul , Los Angeles , San Francisco/ San Jose , New York , Chicago and Dallas. ) // " Initially , I tried to talk Steve out of the whole thing , " says New York Liberties general manager Jerry Saperstein , whose father , Abe , was the promotional genius behind the Harlem Globetrotters . But it was Saperstein who came around . " As my old man used to say , ' You ca n't fault anyone for failing , just for not trying . ' " // Arnold runs the league like a small barony . G.M.s all get the same pay , $17,500 . Players receive a $6,000 base salary for the 22-game season . They earn an extra $50 for each win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kills and digs . // The MLV players were selected in a draft last December . Members of the U.S. national team were excluded because they 're in training for the ' 88 Games , and Arnold did n't want to risk annoying the U.S. coach , Terry Liskevych . Nevertheless , MLV protects a player 's Olympic eligibility by placing her salary in a trust and paying her per diem expenses , a delayed-payment system that is widely practiced in track and field . A few of the MLV players have been invited to national-team tryouts , but New York player-coach Mary Jo Peppier says , " Realistically , none of the players has much of a chance to make the national team . The roster is pretty much set . " // Peppier played on the first U.S. women 's Olympic volleyball squad in 1964 . She coached at Utah State and Kentucky and has written a book , The 15-Minute Setter , which is not about a quail-hunting dog but about the strategy of feeding players who are open for kills . Peppier , who is 42 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My body wo n't always do what my mind tells it to , " she admits . Her players are better listeners . " I 'm not Bobby Knight , " she says . " I tell them the most important thing is that they have a commitment to happiness . " // Peppier proposed that the national team be one of the MLV franchises . " Imagine the Olympic basketball team playing in the NBA , " she says . But Liskevych has shown little interest in having his team play at the MLV level . // Volleyball fans on both coasts have displayed a similar apathy . Rather than watch MLV games in person , they would just as soon catch the delayed broadcast on ESPN , which is n't exactly the healthiest sign for a fledgling league . There is cause for concern over the league 's long-term prospects . Arnold says the MLV has enough financing to make it for at least two seasons . If most games pull just 386 patrons , he 'll need it . // Saperstein claims that the fans who do come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twos and threes , but they return , " he says . Attendance figures are uneven throughout the league . The same night that the Liberties drew their 386 on Long Island , 2,490 showed up at the Edina ( Minn . ) Community Center , which has also never been big volleyball country . Meanwhile in Los Angeles , where people really play the game , the average attendance has been around 750 . The league says the break-even point for MLV is an average attendance of 1,500 a game . // Those fans on Long Island saw gritty , scrambling , relentless volleyball . Many of them were wildly enthusiastic . DeNitto was positively transported , especially after getting New York 's middle blocker , Laura Smith , to sign his pennant . The 6-foot Smith is tall enough to attract John , but Helen says she 's not the real reason that he comes to the Liberties ' home games . Setter Wendy Stevenson is . And she 's only 5 ' 8 " . // " I know , " John confesses . " But to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
