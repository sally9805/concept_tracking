BOOKS Hem Battles the Pack ; Wins , Loses HEmtracway signed his early letters Ernest , Ernie , EH , Hemingstein , Hemmy , Stein , Hem , Wemedge , Steen , Love Pups , Din , Yogi Liveright , and Herbert J. Messkit . Such a wealth of inventive and jocular monickers suggests a pow  --  erful wish to be somebody , whatever it takes . A few days before his nineteenth birthday , he became , he wrote his family back in Oak Park , " the first American wounded in Italy . " While recovering from this , the most important wound in his life of many wounds , he was the youngest patient at the Milan Red Cross Hos  --  pital , and while still there received a promotion that made him , he proudly told his father , " the youngest 1st Lieut. in the Army .

" He did not sign himself Papa until 1927 , in a let  --  ter to Archibald MacLeish . Indeed , he employed this most famous of his so  --  briquets rather more sparingly than one might expect  --  largely in relation to younger writers for whom he adopted a paternal fondness ( Lillian Ross , George Plimpton ) , to a few fa  --  vored females who appeared to him in a daughterly aspect ( Marlene Die  --  trich , Adriana Ivancich ) , and to his own three sons . A letter to Harvey Breit in 1954 he signed Papa and then thought better of it , crossing it out and writing instead Ernest ( After the publication of " The Old Man and the Sea " in Life , he complained to Wal  --  lace Meyer , " Then some perfectly in  --  nocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa ' by paying 20 cents for the copy of LIFE and you say , I may be your father but you look like a son of a bitch to me , ' and the next thing you have hurt somebody 's feel  --  ings and you have to cool him to put him out of his misery . " ) To his first wife , Hadley , Hemingway was Tatie or Edward Everett Waxen , and to Mary Welsh , who became his fourth and last wife , he was Bear Mountain or Old Mountain Man or Your Big Kitten . Three letters to Lillian Ross , who brought out in him a maximum of playfulness , are signed Mister Papa , Mr. Pappa , and H. von FL , which is short for Huck von Hemingstein , a self-designation merging his ideal con  --  cepts of himself as an Old World gallant and an in  --  carnation of the American literary genius epitomized AL by " Huckleberry Finn . " " All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn .... It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that . There was noth  --  ing before . There has been nothing as good since . " So he claimed in " Green Hills of Africa ; " the other quotations above come from Heming  --  way 's " Selected Letters 1917-1961 , " edited by Carlos Baker ( Scribners ; $27.50 ) . Hemingway did not want his letters published . In 1958 , he wrote his exec  --  utors , " It is my wish that none of the letters written by me during my life  --  time shall be published . Accordingly , I hereby request and direct you not to publish or consent to the publication by others , of any such letters . " He did not regard himself as a good letter writer , and frequently ends a letter with an apology for it : " This letter is stupid ; " " Please forgive such a stupid letter ; " " Please forgive me for writing dull and stupid letters . " Of his missives to Charles Scribner , Sr. , many of which are printed in this volume , he wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should take great care that nobody gets hold of them nor that they are ever " consulted " by any of the personal approach critics ; or any critics or biographers . The personal letters arc often libellous , always indiscreet , often obscene and many of them could make great trouble . During his lifetime , especially after the cost of being somebody had grown exorbitant , he bitterly resented and re  --  sisted invasions of his privacy by scholars . To Charles A. Fenton , the author of " The Apprenticeship of Er  --  nest Hemingway : The Early Years " ( 1954 ) , he declared , " The writing published in hooks is what I stand on and I would like people to leave my private life the hell alone . What right has anyone to go into it ? I say no right at all . " When Fenton proposed to publish some of Hemingway 's early , unsigned journalism , he was told , " Writing that I do not wish to pub  --  lish , you have no right to publish . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would cheat a man at cards or rifle his desk or wastebasket or read his personal letters . " And to Arthur Mizener , the biographer of Scott Fitz  --  gerald , Hemingway once wrote , " I figure to have all my papers and un  --  completed Mss. burned when I am buried . I do n't want that sort of shit to go on . " Yet here , just twenty years after the great man 's death , we have a towering excremental heap  --  nearly six hundred letters and over nine hundred pages published through the connivance of Mary Hemingway , her attorney Alfred Rice , Charles Scribner , Jr. , and Carlos Baker . By one of those disservices of which only reverence is capable , the letters are all reproduced uncut ( Hemingway was not naturally laconic , it turns out ) and with their " endearing " misspellings carefully preserved . One reaction seems certain : Hemingway , who so heroically strove to keep anything in  --  ferior from his pen out of hard covers , and who even at his most flamboyant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , would have hated this overlong , sludgy , and frequently humiliating book . WELL , what 's done is done . As a piece of manufacture and edito  --  rial work , the volume warrants an A-minus , perhaps a B-plus . Mr. Baker knows his Hemingway , but the appa  --  ratus of footnotes is minimal , with frequent references , in lieu of helpful explication , to " Ernest Hemingway : A Life Story , " by the same Carlos Baker ( 1969 ) , which in turn derives much of its content from summary of these same letters . The biography alludes to a number of interesting letters ( for example , a letter of August 18 , 1938 , to Mrs. Paul Pfeiffer , his mother-in-law at the time , describing his break with Catholicism and prayer because of the conduct of the Spanish Church during the Civil War ; a letter of August 27 , 1940 , to Arnold Gingrich , of Esquire , " computing what For Whom the Bell Tolls had cost him ; " and a number of his last sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not present in this selection . ' Without knowing the full correspondence , as only God and Car  --  los Baker do , one can not judge the selecting . One can wonder why , if the object is a scholarly monument to a native giant whose every word is precious , a complete , multi-volume edition of letters such as the French are giving Colette and the English have given Virginia Woolf has not been launched ; and why , if the intended audience is the general reader , a somewhat less cumbersome and expensive selection was not made . The proceeds , we are piously told , " are to be devoted to the Ernest Hemingway Foundation , which makes annual awards in the field of American fiction under the aegis of the P.E.N . Club . " Ten dollars off the sale price would have been a well-deserved award to the heroic Ameri  --  can book buyer . Yet there is some  --  thing exiguous about the volume any  --  way . One letter after another slogs past without a single chapter break or interval of biographical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life , no bibliography of his works , no glossary of his major corre  --  spondents , and no typographical dis  --  tinction in the index between simple references to a person and letters writ  --  ten to that person . This user found the index erratic . For instance , no refer  --  ence exists under " Hemingway , Grace Hall " to this definitive blast , in a letter to Charles Scribner , Sr. : My mother is very old , her memory is more than spotty and she is addicted to fantastic statements . Lately , because she is so old , I have played the role of a devoted son in case it pleased her . But I hate her guts and she hates mine . She forced my father to suicide ... The index also ignores this interesting verdict upon the Spanish philosopher Miguel de Unamuno : Do you remember what a dull and con  --  ceited man Unamuno was ? But often he was right . I used to sit around by the hour listening and waiting for him to he right . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the picture of Hemingway 's life already provided by his own fiction and journalism , by the heavy publicity he received while alive , by the personal accounts of A. E. Hatchner and Mary Hemingway and others , and by Mr. Baker 's own biography . No skeletons such as have been recently found in several Presi  --  dential closets come to light . Nor do the letters enhance or soften with newly glimpsed humanity the writer 's image , as do the letters of Scott Fitz  --  gerald and John O'Hara . Hemingway in fact is seen in these missives , in their cruel dismissals and constant boasting , as even more of a bully and braggart than we had suspected . Nor are they , like the letters of Kafka and Keats , literature ; written usually at the end of a long day of work and play , sometimes with the aid of inhibition-loosening spirits , they are more often than not garrulous , repetitious , and coarse . There are some exceptions : the letters of condolence to Gerald and Sara Murphy and to Mrs. Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last letters in the book  --  the first a letter to his grandfather from an eighteen-year-old boy who has spent the summer in upper Michigan work  --  ing on a farm and who is worried about the potato crop and proud of three large rainbow trout he has caught , and the last from a sixty-one  --  year-old man with a Nobel Prize and a bad case of hypertension writing to console a nine-year-old boy hospi  --  talized with viral heart disease . Him  --  self hospitalized in Minnesota , Hemingway wrote young Frederick Saviers , " Saw some good bass jump in the river . I never knew anything about the upper Mississippi before and it is really a very beautiful country and there are plenty of pheasants and ducks in the fall . " From first to last , his letters do homage to whatever beautiful country the writer is in part bragging and part simple praise of the world . In a letter to Maxwell Perkins , he de  --  scribed himself as " having a great deal of fondness and admiration for the earth and not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondence pulses with the subliminal message " Having wonderful time " that Harry Levin , in his unsurpassed essay upon Hemingway 's style ( reprinted in last year 's " Memories of the lkloderns " ) , saw as the essential burden of those generalized pet adjectives " fine " and " nice " and " good " and " lovely " : The races at Auteuil with everybody crowded around the big charcoal brazier and a November bright blue sky and the turf hard and the fields good and we watching each race from the top of the stands ... and we went up in the moun  --  tains at a Swiss old brown chalet and ski  --  ed and had a bob sled and drank hot punch in the evenings and the days were cold and clear arid there was lots of snow .

We bring our drinking water and ice and fresh vegetables on the pilot boat that Comes once a week from Miami . There is no kind of sickness on the island Bimini and the average age of people in the ceme  --  tery is 85 . The blunt yet somehow urgent and luminous style was there from the start , and can be detected even in the letters written at the age of nine which Mr. Baker quotes in his introduction : I looked in a clam that I had brought to school from the river . Had shut down on one of our big Japanese fantail gold fishes tales . On Saturday Mama and I went across the ford at the river . Words for Hemingway were elemental and chaste , spurning any secondary life of wordplay . In the over four hundred thousand words of these let  --  ters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extended metaphor , concern ing the sudden death , eleven years after their divorce , of his second wife , Pauline , comes with grotesque effect , as of a pained contortion : The wave of remembering has finally risen so that it has broken over the jetty that I built to protect the open roadstead of my heart and I have the full sorrow of Pauline 's death with all the harbour scum of what caused it . Occasionally but not often in the cor  --  respondence , a word picture leaps up as sharp as the italicized paragraphs between the stories of " In Our Time . " To Harvey Breit , concerning the burial of the Spanish novelist Pio Baroja , in 1956 : The day was misty with the sun break  --  ing through and burning off over the bare hills and on the way out to the un-con  --  secrated ground cemetery the side of the streets were jammed solid with flowers , the flower sellers stands for Nov 2 ?

He was buried in a plain pine coffin , newly painted black so that the paint came off on the faces and the hands of the pall bearers and on their coats . CERTAIN traits , not especially at  --  tractive , of Hemingway 's psyche emerge through these letters . He re  --  flexively saw wives as the ruin of their husbands . In 1924 , he wrote his Chi cago friend William B. Smith , Jr. , from Paris , " The number of genuwind all Caucasian white guys in the world is limited .... There 'd prob  --  ably be a number more if they did n't marry foecal matter in various forms . JULY 13 , 1981 There 's a guy named Lewis Ga  --  lantiere over here was a priceless guy and he has been hooked and married by the most absolute copper plated bitch in the world and he ai nt a good guy any more . " Smith 's older brother Y. K. and Maxwell Perkins ( " Max was Max with five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were among the other priceless guys that Hemingway viewed as unworthily wed . Even Gertrude Stein he saw as maliciously dominated by her compan  --  ion Alice Toklas . " Alice had the am  --  bition of the devil and was very jealous of Gertrude 's men and women friends . .. . Alice was her evil angel as well as her great friend . " When Fitz  --  gerald 's " evil angel " Zelda fell ill , Hemingway 's heart did not soften . He wrote Maxwell Perkins : A woman ruined Scott . It was n't just Scott ruining himself . But why could n't he have told her to go to heti ? Because she was sick . It 's being sick makes them act so bloody awful usually and it 's because they 're Sick you ca n't neat them as you should . The first great gift for a man is to be healthy and the second , maybe greater . is to fall with healthy women . You can always trade one healthy woman in on another . But start with a sick woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could wax sentimental , but only the divorce from Hadley seems to have given him real pain . He was an unabashedly unfaith  --  ful husband and , of course , antagonis  --  tic to his mother , whom he blamed for her lack of loyalty to his early pub  --  lished work , for his father 's suicide , and for an obscure oppression upon himself ; he wrote to Maxwell Perkins that he could not " write anything true about Scott Fitzgerald as long as Zelda is alive anymore than I can write with my bitch of a mother still able to read . " Yet , at the same time , he was a ladies ' man , virile and courtly , and even something of a mama 's boy . A curious juvenile tone runs through his letters like a plaintive un  --  invited music . To Pauline Pfeiffer , in the period immediately after he left Hadley for her , he whimpered , " And all the time when you wo n't get letters and me instead of us being so happy and having all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing sin and I get the horrors ... " Years later , in the midst of leaving Pauline for Martha Gellhorn , he turned hack to Hadley as to an ideal mother and confided , " I 'm in the wrong of course . But I never do what I should n't just to do it ; nor from carelessness . Only sort of when you THE NEW YORKER have to . " With the same ingenuous trustingness , like a little boy bravely reporting from camp , he assured Mary Hemingway in the last year of his life , " Plenty others problems but we will work them out and I 'll get healthy and write fine . " In the last months of his life , he was haunted by the fear that he was being trailed by the I.R.S. and the F.B.I. , and there is no more touching , or gallant , document in this volume than the letter written in the Mayo Clinic " To Whom It May Concern , " ab  --  solving Mary Hemingway of com  --  plicity in his phantasmal crimes : She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the sketchiest outline of my finances and only helped me in preparing my returns on material I fur  --  nished her . The bags that I carried had her labels on them but she always believed from the time I met her in New York that the only reason I traveled as I did was to avoid the press a practice I had followed for years . She was never an accomplice nor in any sense a fugitive and only followed the advice of a doctor friend that she trusted . The letters of some years previous  --  indeed , back to 1940 , when " For Whom the Bell Tolls " gave him his first big income  --  show an exceptional concern with scrupulous payment of his taxes , and when the matter of ob  --  scene words in his early novels arose he several times expressed a slightly off-key fear of going to jail , of " trou  --  ble .

" It is dangerous when you have an enemy to do anything but kill him , " he wrote Maxwell Perkins . For what  --  ever irretrievable reason , he was a man on the defensive , on the run . In the Army , amid buddies and declared ene  --  mies , he felt safe from authority , and relished the share of it that fell to him as soldier and officer . In the Second World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press credentials for taking upon himself a degree of military command and martial ardor improper to a middle-aged war correspondent ; before going to the European theatre , in 1944 , he had concocted a maverick naval command for himself in the Caribbean ; and during his last trip to Africa he relished his official role as honorary game warden . Repeatedly he stated that his months with the Amer  --  ican armies in France and Germany in 1944 and 1945 were the happiest days of his life  --  the most wonderful time of all . " You will be very proud of what the Division has done and I have never been happier nor had a more useful life ever , " he wrote his son Patrick from the battlefield . To the Russian writer Konstantin Sirnonov , he explained , " The time with the R.A.F. was wonderful but useless . With the 4th Infantry Division and with the 22nd regiment of Infantry I tried to be useful through knowing French and the country and being able to work ahead with the Maquis . This was a good life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , to prolong his joy and usefulness , he wrote long letters to his former superiors , the Generals R. 0 . Barton , Charles T. Lanham , and J. Lawton Collins . To Collins , in 1949 , he wrote , " I would like to say that I will be happy to serve under you in any capacity ( preferably in one which involves writing ) at any time , any where , and against any enemies of our country . " Heming  --  way 's wish to sign up under somebody motivates much , I think , of his ful  --  some correspondence with men , and produced in his last lonely decade em  --  barrassing effusions to Bernard Beren  --  son , one of which winds up : But B.B.

Specially with Miss Mary who is under the impres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the column . Please forgive me for continuing writ  --  ing . It is only because I am lonely . You with your lovely achieved age are , in a way , or without any stupid compliments my HERO . One need not be a psychoanalyst to hear in such abject ramblings the inner voice of the small , mysteriously " bad " boy who found refuge from the pack led by his redoubtable mother at the side of his father  --  doctor and hunter , healer and killer . The letters make more vivid than even his previously published descrip JULY 13 , 1981 tions of blood sports and war how sincerely Hemingway liked to kill . " I like to shoot a rifle and I like to kill and Africa is where you do that . " His detailing of animal death is remorse  --  less : Charles Thompson shot a bull elk , we shot one together , and I killed one alone .... Bull went down in gulch . We started over , Charles watching to see if he got up . Vi way there hull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back under his fire , got a rest against tree and hit him . He slumped forward and spraddled but still going . Charles shot his hind leg clean off ( really ) at knee joint and he went clown . He was hit five times and when we opened him up found top of his heart shot off  --  both lungs  --  Charles first shot was through and through but in his mouth just above back bone . I killed a 7 point huge bull at 11,000 about one shot , running , ( he and I both running ! ) bullet went in ribs above kid  --  neys took top off lungs . He bled internally ? ran 50 yards down hilt without a drop of blood and was stone dead . Even more gruesome is his tale , to Charles Scribner , of his murder of a German prisoner of war : One time I killed a very snotty SS kraut who , when I told him I would kill him unless he revealed what his escape route signs were said : You will not kill me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because you are a race of mongrel degener  --  ates . Besides it is against the Geneva Con  --  vention . What a mistake you made , brother , I told him and shot him three times in the belly fast and then , when he went down on his knees , shot him on the topside so his brains came out of his mouth or I guess it was his nose . Whether or not this is fantasy , his proposed treatment of Max Eastman , who had criticized his " literary style ... of wearing false hair on the chest , " certainly is : I 've got one ambition . Not an obsession . Just an ambition to nail that son of a bitch max eastman to the top of a fence post with a twenty penny spike through the base of his you know what and then push him backwards slowly . After that I 'd start working on him . Cheerfully he machine-gunned sharks , yearned " to take the tommy gun and open up at 21 or the Mew Repub  --  lie offices , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not counting pos  --  sible or necessary shootings " ) , and com  --  plained to General Barton that " writ  --  ing is dull as hell after what we used to do . I have n't killed a son of a bitch for over four years now . " His last quarry he brought down by resting the butt of a double-barrelled shotgun on the floor of his house in Ketchum , Idaho , resting his forehead on the husi THE NEW YORKEf3 ness end of the gun , and  --  an en  --  thusiast 's nicety  --  tripping the trigger on both barrels . ANY lifetime 's worth of letters read straight through will trace a grim organic curve from obscure and hopeful youth through success of some sort ( else why would we be reading the letters ? ) into decay , decline , disap  --  pointment , and death . The aroma of death is present in " Selected Letters " almost from the start ; on page 13 we have a drawing , done by the artist on his nineteenth birthday , of the young hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lettered " 227 wounds " ( always a great tabulator , Hemingway ) and the words " gim me a drink ! " floating in a balloon out of his mouth . Ten years later , the now mature artist was to transcribe that formative trauma into these sentences of " A Farewell to Arms " : I ate the end of my piece of cheese and took a swallow of wine . Through the other noise I heard a cough , then came the chuh-chul-i-Auh-chuh  --  then there was a flash , as when a blast-furnace dour is swung open , and a roar that started white and went red and on and on in a rushing wind . I tried to breathe but my breath would not come arid I felt myself rush bodily out of myself and out and out and out and all the time bodily in the wind . I went out swiftly , all of myself , and I knew 1 was dead and that it had all been a mistake to think you just died . Then I floated , and instead of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was back . Back from that supernatural experi  --  ence , Hemingway enjoyed ever alter an ambiguous , exhilarating intimacy with the idea of dying , with religion , with pain and danger . Authentically cool and stoical , he was accident-prone to a grotesque degree , and survived more injuries than normally befall a dozen men : skylights fell on his head , drunks ( including , once , Wallace Ste  --  vens ) challenged him to fistfights , cars he was in ran off the road into ditches or steel water tanks . To Maxwell Per  --  kins in 1932 he wrote , " Since I started this book have had compound fracture of index finger  --  had general smash up in that bear hunt-14 stitches in face inside and out  --  hole in leg  --  then that right arm  --  muscular spiral paralysis ? 3 fingers in right hand broken-16 stitches in left wrist and hand .

" In January of 1954 , in Uganda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes on successive days , and while recuperating from his very serious injuries ( concussion , ruptured liv  --  er , spleen , and kidney , a crushed ver  --  tebra , temporary loss of vision in the left eye and of hearing in the left ear , and paralysis of the sphincter ) , Hemingway insisted on helping put out a brushfire and fell into the flames , acquiring second- and third-degree burns . Just before this last episode , he had dictated a fifteen-thousand-word account of his misadventures for Look , a masterpiece of droll understatement ending with a confession of his new " vice , " the reading of his own obitu  --  aries . These had appeared , premature  --  ly , worldwide . " I intend to read them at least once a year in order to keep my morale up to par when the critics have recovered their aplomb and return to the assault .

" This was so much what the people at home wanted to hear that the letter was published in the local newspaper , the Oak Parker . To the terminally ill Ernest Walsh , he offered from Paris , " Altho the more I think of it the more I think that any form of dying can he made pretty swell . One of the things that I really look forward to is dying  --  but want to he at least 85 when it happens . " After his tour of the Spanish Civil War , he wrote Pau-line 's mother , " This last spell of war completely eliminated all fear of death or anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a bad way and certain things so necessary to do that to think about any personal future was simply very egoistic . " Hemingway 's disillusion with the rightist Church during the Civil War eliminated , as well , the last vestiges of his professed Catholicism . His relation with the Catholic Church also could be de  --  scribed as curious and flirtatious . Con  --  firmed as a Congregationalist , and in his youthful letters given to reassur  --  ing his mother of his Christianity JULY 13 , 1981 ( " Just because I 'm a cheerful Chris tian ought not to bother you " ) , Hemingway by 1920 was writing to Grace Quinlan of how , in Boyne City , he and his friend Kate Smith " went to the catholic church and burnt a candle and I prayed for all the things I want and wo n't ever get and we came out in a very fine mood .

In a letter quoted in Bak er 's biography but not published in " Selected Letters , " he assured an inquiring Dominican father that he possessed " so much faith " that he " hated to examine into it . " A letter of 1929 mentions attending Mass in Paris with Pauline and Allen Tate , and his pre-1940 fiction not in frequently alludes to Christian symbols and prayers . A wry , Unamunoesque sort of faith compels shadowy blas phemies like the " our nada who art in nada " parody in " A Clean , Well Lighted Place " and the interior soliloquy of Robert Jordan in " For Whom the Bell Tolls " that runs in part , " Now and forever now .

" For this rough , rude , appetitive , and even murderous man had bent his thoughts more intently toward literary immortality and perfection of prose than any American fiction writer since Henry James . His writing competed with his life  --  at first , with the need to make a dollar and the wish to have a good time ; later , with celebrity , ill health , and the wish to have a good time .

Thus he introduced the book of stories that certified him , he felt , as " a sort of lasting business . " In all conditions of convalescence and hangover , in hotel rooms and in his homes in Paris and Key West , Cuba and Sun Valley , he wrote , rising early and lovingly noting the number of words achieved each morning  --  a habit left over from his days of counting words for foreign dispatch .

" Hemingway be  --  gan with difficult , outdoorsy theories . " I 'm trying to do the country like Cezanne and having a hell of a time and sometimes getting it a little bit , " he wrote Gertrude Stein in 1924 , of the short story " Big Two-Hearted River , " which represented to him a breakthrough . " It is much better than anything I 've done , " he told Edward J. O'Brien , one of his first appreciators . " What I 've been doing is trying to do country so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually have the Country . It is hard because to do it you have to see the country all complete all the time you write and not just have a romantic feeling about it . It is swell fun . " The young mod  --  ernist of the Paris years , eagerly con  --  sorting with Pound and Joyce and Stein , living above a sawmill with his pretty Hadley and little Bumby and tapping out his elliptical tales of a boy 's Michigan and a soldier 's Europe in a language as clean as dawn air , scarcely needs the idyll of " A Move  --  able Feast " to strike us as Heming  --  way 's best self . In obscurity and pov  --  erty , alloying the direct voice of his journalism with the exalted resolves of the Mandarin expatriates , he stub  --  bornly forged a style that became , for a generation and more of stoic , hedonis  --  tic , " lost " men , a life style . The style seemed to some ( but not to Pound , or Fitzgerald. , or Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found Hemingway simply stupid . Yet the letters show a remarka  --  ble range of reading , classics and con  --  temporaries both ( " Thank God for books , " he wrote l3erenson fervently ) , and , though professors and translators find errors in the foreign phrases with which he garnished his fiction and his letters , he did make his way , through sheer quickness of ear , in French , Ital  --  ian , Spanish , and German . As Mal  --  colm Cowley has attested , " he learned almost anything with amazing speed . " On the subjects of writing and being an author , he is always interesting , shrewd , and sound , if sometimes ill-tempered . He cared about every facet of his craft , however small . He wrote of typos , " There is nothing to spoil a persons appreciation of good stuff like typographical errors , " and cannily saw that too many blurbs on a book jacket " simply put the reader on the defen  --  sive . " Slang , he thought , should be used sparingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He never had an agent , did n't like advances ( though he came to depend on " loans " from Scribners ) , and said that critics " have ruined every writer that reads them . " " When they do not understand it you get angry ; if they do understand it you only read what you already know and it is no good for you . " Even fan mail , when , after " A Farewell to Arms , " it began to arrive in quantity , he found disturbing : " People write swell letters about it and I am so sick of it that a fan letter only makes you embarrassed and uneasy and vaguely sick , It 's hard enough to write ? and writing prose is a full time job and all the best of it is dune in your subconscious and when that is full of business , reviews , opinions , etc. , you do n't get a damned thing . " In his faith in the subconscious , he is almost a Surrealist . A lot in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ing , the marlin fishing  --  was an at  --  tempt to keep the vessel of his mind clean for next dawn 's distillation of words . He had keen senses of smell and taste , and purity was his dominant ideal . " When you tell so much of the truth you ca n't afford to have anything not true because it spoils the taste . " Ile thought Scott Fitzgerald ruined " Tender Is the Night " by putting in too much that was not true of the Murphys and himself and Zelda . Concerning the residue of actuality in his own fictions , Hemingway testified variously : " I believe when you are writing stories about actual people , not the best thing to do , you should make them those people in everything except telephone addresses , " he told Ernest Walsh in 1926 ; a few years later he confessed to Perkins , of " In Our Time , " " The reason most of the book seems so true is because most of it is true and I had no skill then , nor have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very much . " His short stories were more clef than his novels ; he assured Per  --  kins , " I invented every word and every incident of A Farewell to Arms except possibly 3 or 4 incidents . All the best part is invented . 95 per cent of The Sun Also was pure imagination . I took real people in that one and I controlled what they did . I made it all up . " Joyce , the one contemporary writer he always respected , made up Bloom , and Bloom is the character that saves " Ulysses " from the dully autobio  --  graphical Stephen Dedalus . The de  --  finitive pronouncement on this uncom  --  fortable matter is perhaps given in a But it is not as simple as all that . " READERS of " A Moveable Feast " startled by the acid sketches Hemingway provides of his former friends and fellow-writers would not have been surprised had they read these letters first . They abound in harsh and even rabid put-downs . " Tom Wolfe was a one book boy and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mice . " " T. S. Eliot ... never hit a ball out of the infield in his life and he would not have existed except for dear old Ezra , the lovely poet and stupid traitor . " " Scott Fitzgerald was a rummy and a liar and dishonest about money with the in-bred talent of a dishonest and easily frightened angel . " " Sherwood Anderson was a slob . " And so on . He said of Scott Fitzgerald that he was " generous without being kind , " but the remark seems truer of Hemingway himself . Though self-forewarned , he did not entirely avoid following Gertrude Stein 's had example when " she started taking herself seriously rather than her work seriously . " In all the anecdotes relayed in these letters , there is hardly a one in which Hemingway lets himself look bad , or in need of the kindness and expertise of others . He several times relates scornfully that Fitzgerald advised him to bring in the United States Marines at the end of " A Farewell to Arms , " but slurs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " coldly disowns ) the crucial good advice Fitz  --  gerald gave him on " The Sun Also Rises , " which began with a mean-spirited and mock-suave essay on the chief characters that Fitzgerald found " careless and ineffectual " and that Hemingway accordingly cut , assuring Perkins , " I think it will move much faster from the start that way . Scott agrees with me . " As Fitzgerald 's let  --  ter and the discarded opening chapters , both printed in the Spring , 1979 , ntaeus , demonstrate , it was Hemingway who agreed with Fitzger  --  ald , just as Eliot agreed with Pound 's brilliant suggested cuts in " The Waste Land . " No doubt there are other sides to many of the boasts that pass unchecked in the " Selected Letters . " A man less committed to dominat  --  ing every room he was in might have developed more as a writer . He knew the problem : " Publicity , admiration , adulation , or simply being fashionable are all worthless and are extremely harmful if one is susceptible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self as Superpapa swallowed the au  --  thentically bookish , sensitive man and contaminated his alter egos ; the heroes of his seven novels  --  Jake Barnes , Frederic Henry , Harry Morgan , Rob  --  ert Jordan , Richard Cantwell , Santi  --  ago , and Thomas Hudson  --  are pro  --  progressively sentimentalized . It is a pity , too , and a mystery , that after the four egocentric but compelling tales of the Spanish Civil War published in 1938 and 1939 , when Hemingway was not yet forty , his large and lively gift for the short story sank from sight  --  swamped , it would seem , by the nightmare of violence always lurking beneath the pellucid tense sentences . Still , much unsinkable work was done . A reader of " Selected Letters " should keep nearby , as did this reader , some volumes of the oeuvre to turn to when overwhelmed by the braggadocio , bru  --  tality , and bathos that Hemingway inflicted upon his correspondents and now , without his willing it , upon pos  --  terity . The distilled  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  way is to be found in the writing he published in books , just where he said it would be . ? JOHN UPDIKE 1311.1EFLY NOTED FICTION MONKEY GRIP , by Helen Garner ( Seaview ; $10.95 ) . A startling love story , told by a woman in her mid-thirties who works for a feminist newspaper and lives in a colony of artists , hippies , and drug addicts in southern Australia . Her lover is a heroin addict ten years her junior , with a " crooked , wrecked , and wild " face and a " dangerous idle  --  ness in the bloodstream . " It is with amazement , and sometimes amuse  --  ment , that she watches herself stand back or stand by him , as his addic  --  tion demands and in complete dis regard of her feminist instincts . This could be a maudlin or a grue  --  some story , but instead it is elegant and wry ; the woman depicts every detail of her days and nights with eye-catching precision ( a drug dealer passing through customs : " Even his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the translucent , fined-out pallor of the ex-junkie " ) , and the reader is always alert to her vig  --  orous intelligence and her sensuality . This is Helen Garner 's first novel , and a winner of the Australian Na  --  tional Book Council Award . NOTE : " The Last Laugh , " a collec  --  tion of S. J.

GENERAL NATIONAL DEFENSE , by James Fal lows ( Random House ; $12.95 ) . This is the most intelligent ( and , unfortunately , the most dishearten  --  ing ) hook on its subject in a long time . The author points out that our present political cleavage has the right wanting to spend more money on defense and the left less , but that neither party has examined with any care just why defense costs have risen and what we are getting for our money . The answer , he tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it turns out , is less effective in action than simpler and cheaper weapons are , since it breaks down constantly because of its need
