A MOON FOR THE MISBEGOTTEN by Eugene O'Neill <P> Eugene O'Neill was , supremely , a vernacular poet who found his most haunting rhythms in the profoundly mixed emotions of his characters , his most memorably dissonant sonorities in the muddled motives with which they confront memory , fate and each other . A Moon for the Misbegotten , his last completed play , is structurally the simplest of the late great work . It is also perhaps the most anguished , because O'Neill was searching so hard for a ray of hope in the dawn that completes this long night 's journey into day . <P> The playwright sometimes substituted repetition for inspiration in his prolonged dying fall . He could seem like a drunk at a party who makes the other guests linger while he tries to find the point of a tale that is too long in the telling . But in recounting how Josie Hogan ( Kate Nelligan ) and James Tyrone Jr .

Raucous , tender and compelling , she is an astonishment , the perfect instrument for young English Director David Leveaux 's energetic and often surprisingly humorous conception of the play . She is ably supported by grand , goatish Jerome Kilty as her ever scheming father , and there is an atmosphere of stark eloquence in Brien Vahey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only Bannen lets down the side . He is an intelligent actor , but he never finds the fire in the ashes of his character . What should have been a duet is , as a result , too often an aria . But perfectly sung . <P> - Richard Schickel
