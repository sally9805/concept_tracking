The widening Wedtech scandal last week rippled closer to Attorney General Edwin Meese . In New York City , U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani produced indictments charging an old Meese friend , his investment counselor and a former Wedtech adviser with racketeering and fraud . Among their alleged crimes : extracting illegal payments from Wedtech for trying to get Meese to help the ailing , minority-owned , Bronx-based construction firm . <P> The latest of 15 people accused in the long-running affair are E. Robert Wallach , a Meese friend of 30 years and former personal lawyer who became a highly paid Wedtech lobbyist ; W. Franklyn Chinn , a former Wedtech director who handled investments profitably for Meese in a " blind partnership " trust ; and Rusty Kent London , a professional gambler and past financial consultant to Wedtech . The indictments contend that Wallach received a check for $300,000 from Wedtech in 1984 , claiming falsely that the payment was for past legal advice to the company . " In fact , " contended Giuliani , " the money was for future services , including efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallach , according to the indictment , told the company that he - had a job lined up at the Justice Department ; he did not get one . <P> Meese has publicly conceded that , at Wallach 's urging , he helped Wedtech get a " fair hearing " on a $32 million Army engine contract in 1982 . The Army , which had considered Wedtech unqualified for the work , agreed to award the no- bid contract to the Bronx firm after an unusual White House meeting in the office of James Jenkins , then Meese 's top deputy . Jenkins later went to work for Wedtech . At the time Meese was Counsellor to the President . Giuliani stressed that the defendants are not charged with illegally influencing Meese , but were indicted for the allegedly unlawful way in which they obtained payoffs for trying to do so . <P> Meese 's possible involvement in the Wedtech affair is still being probed by Independent Counsel James McKay , who issued an interim report last week that fell short of fully clearing him . He said there was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General of having " knowingly participated " in any crime . But , he added , " this is an interim , and not a final , determination . " Referring to Meese , McKay explained that he eventually hopes to pursue a " number of unresolved questions on his involvement with Wedtech Corp . and other matters . " <P> Answers were lacking , McKay explained , because Wallach , Chinn and London had refused to testify before the grand jury McKay had summoned . McKay said he was suspending his investigation of Meese until the New York City prosecutions are concluded . While all three men are expected to deny the charges , last week 's indictments may induce one of them to end his silence . <P> Meese may be merely an innocent victim ; he has testified before the McKay grand jury five times , answering all questions put to him . Nathan Lewin , one of Meese 's personal lawyers , put the rosiest possible hue on McKay 's announcement , saying he was " gratified " that the " most thorough investigation ever conducted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . had been concluded at this time favorably to Attorney General Meese . " Meese 's patron , the President , once again asserted his confidence in his Attorney General .
