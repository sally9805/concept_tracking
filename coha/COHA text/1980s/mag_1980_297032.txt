A TIME poll shows the slightest shift could swing the election <P> They have barnstormed the country like jet-age traveling salesmen . They have jammed the airwaves with millions of dollars ' worth of advertising . They have attacked each other 's records ceaselessly . Their families and friends and surrogates have added their voices to the din of denunciation and promotion . Yet on the very threshold of the presidential election of 1980 , Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan remain just where they were at the beginning of their long campaign-locked in a virtual tie among registered voters in the U.S. <P> According to a survey for TIME completed last week by the opinion research firm of Yankelovich , Skelly and White , Inc. , Carter has an insignificant 1-point lead over Reagan , 42% to 41% , compared with a 39% to 39% tie at the beginning of the fall campaign . The independent candidacy of Congressman John Anderson , however , has continued to sink , just as so many political experts in both parties predicted it would from the start . His share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now. * <P> The mood of the electorate remains as it was at the beginning of the presidential campaign . Americans are disappointed by the choice of candidates they are offered , concerned about the many serious problems facing the country , and skeptical that any President can make much difference . They long for a change , yet are fearful of taking a chance on an inexperienced President . <P> Much of the avowed support for the candidates is still based on opposition to their opponents rather than on genuine enthusiasm for one man or another . Forty-three percent of Reagan 's voters indicate they are more interested in voting against Carter than for Reagan . The President does not fare much better . Thirty-seven percent of Carter 's supporters say they are really just anti-Reagan . <P> Even after having chosen Carter or Reagan , more than half of the voters say they have reservations about the abilities of their candidate . And the level of deeply committed support is extremely low ; few cowbells are being rung at rallies throughout the land this fall . Sixty-one percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although this remains a somewhat grim and unhappy election , the fact that the decision will at long last be reached next week has heightened national attention and made even more important the presidential debate this week . Slowly , quietly , the patterns are changing . The poll indicates that President Carter is reclaiming traditional Democratic support . He is now backed by 66% of the Democrats , compared with the 59% who were for him in September . Most of this new strength comes from party members who had once defected to Anderson but who have come home to their party 's nominee . Anderson now claims 9% of Democrats ; in September he had 15% . Carter is also slowly getting the better of Reagan on some key political issues .
