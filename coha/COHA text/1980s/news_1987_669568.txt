' ' You can talk to me. ' ' // ' ' I don ' t know where to start . Everything ' s been going wrong. ' ' // ' ' You feel confused. . . ? // ' ' My parents are on my case to apply to college . I don ' t want to go . My friends have all been accepted . They ' re changing ; I don ' t feel close to anyone anymore. ' ' // // In a mock conversation between a potential teen-age suicide victim and a teen-age telephone help-line volunteer , two California youths here demonstrate techniques to help identify possible suicide victims and stop the act before it takes place. // The conversation was part of a two-day conference here last week attended by 2 , 000 teen-agers from throughout California , cosponsored by the California Peer Counseling Association , the California State Department of Education , and the Los Angeles County Office of Education. // Of 50 workshops given over two days to train teen-age peer counselors on topics from pregnancy prevention to drug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were packed , in fact - concerned teen-age depression and suicide. // ' ' I came to hear how to identify someone who ' s so depressed they want to kill themselves , ' ' said Shawna Allen , a 13-year-old from Simons Junior High in Pomona. // Jody McAuliffe , also 13 , said : ' ' A lot of kids at our school have problems with their parents and want to run away . Sometimes they talk about suicide . We want to know what to say to them. ' ' // Two occurrences last week drew renewed national attention to the problem of youth suicide . Four young people - two males and two females - died together in New Jersey , and two young women in their upper teens committed suicide together in Illinois. // Teen suicide has for some time been a matter of major concern among parents , educators , sociologists , researchers , and youth counselors across the country. // The suicide rate began to climb rapidly in 1960 and leveled off in 1979 after escalating by 260 percent in that period . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aged 15 to 24 took their own lives. // Suicide prevention specialists see no prospect of a significant drop in the rate. // ' ' The peak has passed , but the major point to remember is that the actual rate is phenomenally high compared with 20 years ago , ' ' says Dr. Norman Farberow , director of the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center ( LASPC ) . // His statistics show that suicide rates among 15- to 19-year-olds rose from 3. 6 per 100 , 000 in 1960 to 11. 9 per 100 , 000 in 1970 but has since dropped to 8. 3 , or about 6 , 000 a year . The figure is potentially much higher , he adds , because of the stigma of reporting a suicide. // ' ' Many self-inflicted deaths are reported as accidents , ' ' he explains. // Frank Nelson , director of training for LASPC , fires off a half-dozen reasons for long-term suicide-rate increases , documented in both recent studies and those of a decade ago. // These include conflicts in the family - exacerbated by lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher divorce rates since 1960 ; and economic pressures on the traditional family resulting in two parents working. // Those in turn result in more latchkey children , pressure for women to become ' ' supermoms ' ' - and more pressures on schools to fill in for lack of full-time parents . ' ' It is also hard to document this , ' ' says Dr. Nelson , ' ' but I think children aren ' t as valued today as they were in previous generations. ' ' // Besides increased participation at events such as last week ' s ' ' Teen Hotline ' ' seminars , experts say , activity on behalf of suicide awareness is burgeoning. // ' ' There is an all-out nationwide effort to educate counselors , principals , teachers - even school nurses - on how to identify these ( potential victims ) , ' ' says Dr. Rudolf Hahnloser , senior psychologist at Phoenix Camelback Hospital , who recently cochaired a statewide conference for that very purpose. // Dr. Hahnloser will teach such a class this summer aimed at those people he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' But schools at this point don ' t know what to do , either before or after the fact , ' ' he says. // ' ' Most important is the outlet to talk . Youth must have access to adults that know how to avert the problems , deal with the confusion. ' ' // He says the New Jersey high school attended by the recent victims should have widespread counseling available for friends of the deceased to express their feelings and fears. // Studies have shown a high correlation between well-publicized suicides and dramatic , short-term increases of subsequent suicides . ' ' It would be wrong , though , to have a schoolwide assembly , which could unconsciously glorify their ( the victims ' ) actions , ' ' he said. // In 1983 , the California Legislature established suicide prevention in the schools by mandating a pilot program for junior and high schools statewide . Over years of trial and error , a fourfold curriculum has been developed , presented mostly through existing health education classes. // The program - including staff development workshops , practical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being used by about 30 schools , with 100 more to join the program by fall. // According to Michael Peck , the psychologist in charge , students are taught how to understand depression and stress. // They are also advised that alcohol and drugs - widely held as panaceas - only make matters worse . The students are taught techniques to help friends in dire circumstances. // School staff members and parents are taught how to identify victims . And administrators are taught how the school might react formally , including how to deal with the news media. // In a poll conducted upon partial completion of the program , respondents said they felt a total of 42 suicides had been averted in one year. // But Dr. Peck and Nelson say there are a number of hurdles before the program is more widely accepted. // Some school officials say the program does not belong in the schools , already struggling to teach the basic curriculum adequately . Some parents are concerned about the attention given the subject in peer group situations , feeling that such a program should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphere. // ' ' And then there are the special-interest groups - minorities , religionists , legislators , ' ' Nelson says , ' ' each with its own concerns. ' ' // He calls for a nationwide spirit of compromise and negotiation . ' ' The lawmakers , parents , school boards , and welfare agencies of this country are going to have to come to some consensus about what we ' re going to do with the young in trouble. ' ' // Legislation proposed by US Rep. Gary Ackerman ( D ) of New York would authorize federal grants of up to $100 , 000 for suicide-prevention projects in schools . It would be funded at $1 million in its first year. // Another area of suicide research receiving attention in recent years is that of special populations , such as handicapped or gifted children. // Arlene Metha , an associate professor in the division of psychology and education at Arizona State University in Tempe , has found loopholes in the published works of early researchers such as Lewis Terman in the 1930s . Those works held that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely exempt , owing to superior coping and behavioral skills , from the pressures that lead to suicide. // But a recent study conducted by Dr. Metha in a Phoenix junior high school showed that 15 percent of those considered gifted had contemplated suicide in the past year , compared with 21 percent in a control group of ' ' regular ' ' students. // ' ' This shows we need to take a closer look at all groups of teen-agers and examine our premises about who is more vulnerable , ' ' she says. // Metha and other researchers , as well as parents and school personnel , seem to agree on at least one point about teen suicide : Its high incidence rate can be symptomatic of other things - troubles in workplace , school , and home. // //
