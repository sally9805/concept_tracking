In the Soviet Union , where ideas , like almost everything else , are controlled by the state , the word is propaganda . In the U.S. , Government officials prefer to talk of " public diplomacy , " a term less offensive to free-speech sensibilities . But however they describe it , both superpowers are engaged in an all-out war of words and images aimed at winning hearts and minds around the globe . <P> Propaganda  --  the methodical spreading of information to influence public opinion  --  can take many forms , from a government-approved interview in Pravda to a carefully couched answer at a Washington press conference , from a story planted in a foreign newspaper to a State Department white paper . The line between manipulating mass opinion and enunciating policy , between p.r . posturing and legitimate diplomacy , can be shadowy indeed . Most official declarations , be they from the Kremlin or the White House , have a mixed purpose . <P> Whether subtle or blatant , the role of propaganda is becoming increasingly critical . Television images , bounced off satellites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cliche of the global village a reality . The polarization of nations along East-West lines has intensified the ratings war . Totalitarian states , by virtue of their complete control over the media , are relentless producers of propaganda . Democracies are sometimes gullible consumers . Complex issues can be twisted and made dangerously simple by clever opinion shapers , and if the masses can be moved , their elected leaders must follow . Nuclear weapons have raised the stakes . As real war becomes increasingly costly and nuclear war barely thinkable , East and West must duel with words . " Ideas are weapons , " declared V.I . Lenin more than half a century ago . U.S. Information Agency Director Charles Z. Wick says today , " The only war the U.S. has fought in the past four years has been the propaganda war . " <P> At the summit this November , the battle will peak . Says a top White House aide : " It may be that the summit will be ' won ' or ' lost ' on the p.r . front . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the best camera angles . <P> In the past , Kremlin propaganda has often sounded to the rest of the world , and even to Soviet citizens , like , well , propaganda . The Soviets were once clumsy and loutish as salesmen . When Nikita Khrushchev wanted to make a point at the United Nations in 1960 , he took off his shoe and waved it . Mikhail Gorbachev , by contrast , is a walking advertisement for a different Soviet way of doing things . He is a smooth performer in public and a skillful articulator of the Kremlin line . Like the new man in charge , Soviet propaganda has become subtler and more adroit . A recent example : the slick 56- page pamphlet " Star Wars : Delusions and Dangers " that appeared last month throughout Washington and European capitals , translated into English , French , Spanish and German . Western correspondents are now invited to question urbane Soviet spokesmen at on-the-record press conferences . At a briefing at the Soviet embassy in Bonn last month , the Soviets served trays of caviar canapes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
