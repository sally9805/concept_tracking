 | All right , print the Tony Award ballots ; at last Broadway has a new musical of substance . Big River : The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn is a work of so many virtues that your heart aches because it also has its flaws . But at last this sinister season has produced a musical replete with talent and intelligent ambition , one that touches feelings and thoughts worthy of civilized adults ? and children . Mark Twain 's masterpiece is an ultimate kid 's story and an epic of American light and darkness a generation before the Civil War . William Hauptman 's adaptation is better than pessimists expected but falls short of what optimists hoped . Roger Miller , country music 's king of the road , has written some beautiful songs . And the direction by Des McAnuff , one of the major talents in the American theater , is , at its best , inspired . " Big River " marks the centennial of the publication of " Huckleberry Finn , " one of those works that reveals a culture to itself like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all modern American literature came from " Huckleberry Finn . " Mencken called it one of the great masterpieces of the world , the equal of " Don Quixote . " Bernard De Voto wrote that " in a single step it made a literary medium of the American language . " This step jolted some people ; the book was promptly banned by the Concord Public Library , whose genteel New England sensibilities judged it to be " rough , coarse and inelegant . . . more suited to the slums than to intelligent , respect- able people . " Ironically , there have been new bannings in recent years , prompted by charges of racism . Twain 's cigar must be blazing in his grave . For the heart of the book , and the heart of the musical , is Huck 's loving relationship with the runaway slave Jim , with whom he makes that adventurous , perilous , hilarious , melancholy and mythic journey down the Mississippi . Huck , imbued with the slave morality of the time , ca n't understand the feeling of brotherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he must be " depraved , " but he ca n't resist the impulse of his uncorrupted heart . As their rude raft touches at various towns and settlements , we see the energy and iniquity of America in ferment . This odyssey is beautifully realized by McAnuff and his brilliant set designer , Heidi Landesman , who gives us the big river like a giant artery winding deep into the uncertain American heart . Landesman also evokes the town of St. Petersburg , from which Huck flees from his drunken , violent father and from his guardian , the Widow Douglas . who wants to " civilize " him . In " River in the Rain , " everything comes together : as Huck and Jim sing of their momentary freedom , they light up cigars as the night sky explodes with stars . Miller 's lyrics are outstanding ; they capture the tang of Mark Twain 's various lingos , including the snake-oil malarkey of the Duke and the King , the con men who join the heroes along the way . Another song , " Guv'ment , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ? an anthem of comic but real anger against authority . Skulduggery : These are high points , but there are uncertain passages that lose the flow and thrust of the story . More seriously , much of the grittiness of Twain 's vision has been sanitized . Huck himself , in the person of Daniel H. Jenkins , is no roguish 13-year-old but a golden-curled youth right out of Norman Rockwell . Jenkins is , however , an appealing performer , as is John Short , who plays his buddy Tom Sawyer with an impudent touch of Donald O'Connor . Ron Richardson , a splendid singer , gives Jim a poignant dignity and strength . Rene Auberjonois and Bob Gunton as the Duke and the King caper with comic skulduggery . Auberjonois supplies a touch of Mark Twain 's dark vision when he suddenly appears , stripped of his clownishness , tarred and feathered by the local townsmen . If it tries too much to ingratiate and soothe . " Big River " nevertheless brings an American treasure to life with color and nobility .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
