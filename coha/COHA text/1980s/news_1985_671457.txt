Drawing-room comedy is three theatrical varieties concentrated into one . It ' s part well-made play , part society drama , part comedy of manners . The first of these categories had its origins in 19th-century France , and especially in the work of Scribe and Sardou , and is , if you think about it , rather curiously named . When critics talk of a " well-made play , " the slight sneer in their tone tends to suggest that there ' s something positively virtuous about an ill-made play . In fact , what they usually mean is that the piece is too obviously " made , " too calculated and contrived , too much a matter of carpentry and too little of art . You can tell the well-made play by its carefully manufactured tension , its deftly placed revelations and surprises , its climactic curtain-lines , its near and sometimes trite denouements . The course it takes is determined less by the truth of the dramatist ' s human observation , more by his desire for maximum theatrical impact. // The " society play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1890 ' s - proof that the theater , a place of unsavory reputation earlier in the century , had become increasingly respectable , increasingly fashionable . Its subject was the moneyed , leisured and pukka , and its audience was often that , too . The most famous of the species was probably Arthur Wing Pinero ' s " Second Mrs. Tanqueray , " whose main character marries into the purple , then kills herself when she can no longer conceal her scarlet past ; but there were plenty of others , many of them involving women who break the social or sexual taboos and are punished for their presumption . They throw themselves out of windows , or are reduced to beggary , or are banished to the humdrum suburbs , or in some lesser way glumly illustrate the danger of flouting the conventions of the day. // The comedy of manners has a longer ancestry and , at least in the early days , a less straitlaced one . In the hands of the Restoration dramatists , it was impudent and scabrous , delighting in husbands who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other instances of genteel corruption . Later , it lost its destructive glee , moderated its cynicism , and became increasingly sentimental . For Oscar Wilde , it was less a means of satirizing the faults and foibles of the upper classes , more an opportunity to display a bravura wit . Indeed , his " Lady Windermere ' s Fan " - in which a woman not unlike Mrs. Tanqueray sacrifices her carefully reconstructed reputation in order to save her daughter from the same sexual error she once made herself - could be described as a society drama with a happy ending , a well-made play with epigrammatic lines . It ' s roughly the point at which the comedy of manners becomes the drawing-room comedy. // The ingredients obviously vary from play to play , but the general formula remains much the same . If the setting isn ' t a drawing-room in an elegant townhouse , it ' s one in a country mansion , complete with French windows leading to the inevitable tennis courts . Apart from the numerous servants , the characters take their social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are probably right to do so , since they ' re quite likely to have titles . Love is their principal occupation and preoccupation - will A be reconciled with B , will X pair off with Y ? - and it ' s one that invariably works out well , at least for the pleasant and deserving . Denouements are upbeat and , in spite of the occasional risque episode or incident , morally orthodox . Love may mean sex , but in the last resort it means sex within marriage only . Add plenty of jokes and comic detail , and you have Wilde ' s " Woman of No Importance , " Pinero ' s " Gay Lord Quex , " Somerset Maugham ' s " Lady Frederick , " Lonsdale ' s " Aren ' t We All ? , " Noel Coward ' s " Relative Values " - and , on the other side of the Atlantic , some of the plays of S. N. Behrman and Philip Barry. // Indeed , Barry ' s well-known " Philadelphia Story " is a quintessential drawing-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished porch . The setting is a Main Line mansion , there ' s horseflesh in the stables and water in the swimming pool and clubby references to neighboring Cadwaladers are often on the lips of owners whose family name is , appropriately enough , Lord . The plot describes how the daughter of the house ditches the self-made drip to whom she ' s engaged and remarries her wayward but well-born first husband , C. K. Dexter Haven . And such is the charm of the assorted Lords that they quite win over the radical newshound who has come to expose them as snobs and wastrels : " In spite of the fact that someone ' s up from the bottom , he may be quite a heel . And even though someone else ' s born to the purple , he still may be quite a guy . " Though he would probably have substituted " bounder " for " heel " and " chap " for " guy , " Lonsdale couldn ' t have put it better. // Drawing-room comedy thrives on class-consciousness and a class system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably explains why , despite the example of Barry , it never took hold in egalitarian America to the extent it did on the more stratified side of the ocean . That must also help explain the success of Lonsdale , who regularly populated his plays , not just with lords , but actually with dukes . In " The High Road , " the Duke of Warrington falls in love with an actress , an unconsummated amour that ends with him deciding to make a more suitable match and her returning to the stage . In " On Approval , " the Duke of Bristol is one of a foursome who closet themselves in a Scottish mansion in hopes of discovering whether their mutual liking is sturdy enough to lead to marriage. // That ' s one of Lonsdale ' s most entertaining plays , full of the aggressive wit , the humorous insults , the cantankerous repartee in which he specialized ; and it even seemed a little daring back in 1927 , when the idea of " trial relationships " was a novel one . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawing room does not result in any sharing of bedrooms or beds . Lonsdale affected a cynical , knowing , man-of-the-world manner , but inside him there beat a conventional and somewhat sentimental heart . In " Spring Cleaning , " also a shocking piece in its day , a loving husband introduced a prostitute to his bored wife , in order to show her the likely results of continuing to make lunch engagements with a man he regards as " the lowest type of unmitigated cad . " The warring couple is reconciled , and the unmitigated cad retires from the field , confessing himself impressed. // Lonsdale ' s period was the 1920 ' s . That was when he wrote his liveliest and best-remembered drawing-room comedies : " Aren ' t We All ? , " " On Approval " and " The Last of Mrs. Cheyney , " about a glamorous jewel thief who becomes abjectly besotted with the aristrocrats she intended to rob and ends up marrying one of them . He continued to produce work for another two decades , but increasingly it came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Things Go , " staged not long before his death in 1954 , another Duke of Bristol is coping , and coping very badly , with the austerity of postwar Britain . He ' s told by his bank manager that " I hope to God I never see you or your blasted castle again , " and is only saved from penury by his brother , who leases a farm , employs the family on it , and then marries an American heiress . It ' s a tired play about a tired aristocracy . The time both for dukes and for bright , brittle plays about dukes was clearly coming to an end. // Attacks on the drawing-room comedy and the society drama were nothing new . Back in the 1890 ' s , George Bernard Shaw had professed himself weary of sitting in the theater and watching " a tailor ' s advertisement making sentimental remarks to a milliner ' s advertisement in the middle of an upholsterer and decorator ' s advertisement . " Now , in the 1950 ' s , the critic Kenneth Tynan brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was , he said , bored with characters who belonged " to a social class derived partly from romantic novels and partly from the playwright ' s vision of the leisured life he ' ll lead after his play is a success . " He was bored with persistently being presented with " a glibly codified fairy-tale world , of no more use to the student of life than a doll ' s house to a student of town planning . " He called for drama " about cabmen and demi-gods , about worriors , politicians and grocers. " // He didn ' t quite get that ; but in 1956 he was able to celebrate the arrival of John Osborne ' s " Look Back in Anger , " whose protagonist was a part-time candy-seller and full-time rebel , full of principled scorn for the likes of Lonsdale ' s dukes . The play proved to be a sort of theatrical blowtorch , blistering ears that had become accustomed to being soothingly fanned , and the British drama has never been the same since . Even now , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside kitchen sinks in tenement houses in slum Manchester , the drawing-room comedy tends to be regarded by the British critics as at best irrelevant , at worst reactionary . " Musty , " " preposterous poppycock , " and " unspeakable twaddle " were among the descriptions of William Douglas Home ' s " After the Ball Is Over , " about the romantic and fox-hunting exploits of the Duke of Drayton , when it surfaced in the West End last month. // Unsurprisingly , only Mr. Douglas Home seems to be writing the traditional sort of drawing-room comedy these days . Indeed , the upper classes are rarely to be seen on the stage at all , on either side of the ocean . In America the urbane enthusiasm of Philip Barry has given way to the rueful elegiacs of A. R. Gurney Jr . Instead of the former ' s drawing rooms , there ' s the latter ' s " Dining Room , " which sometimes seems more anthropological field-trip than drama , so quaint does it suggest the tribal rituals of its Boston brahmins to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract attention from left-leaning dramatists , who have proved less than sympathetic . The clubby homage of Lonsdale has given way to the resentment and bitterness of Steven Berkoff , the central episode of whose recent " Decadence " shows an oafish aristocrat snorting and gorging and belching and vomiting his way through a banquet at the Savoy Grill , while simultaneously fondling his equally mindless girlfriend beneath the table. // But perhaps the drawing-room comedy is a more resilient species than this makes it seem . Even in its heyday it sometimes took quirky , unconventional shapes . If Wilde could write the numbingly respectable " Lady Windermere ' s Fan " and " Ideal Husband , " he was also responsible for " The Importance of Being Earnest , " that sly and subversive study of Victorian hypocrisy in action . If Coward could write the similarly orthodox " Relative Values , " in which the Countess of Marshwood charmingly routs the Hollywood starlet her son unwisely wants to marry , he was also the author of " Design for Living , " comic propaganda for a menage a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was S. N. Behrman . Everyone praised him for his civilized humor , but most people felt there was more than that to " Biography " and " End of Summer , " both of which were about a woman faced with a choice between an admirer representing conservatism and safety and one representing radicalism and danger . There was depth , there was breadth of outlook , there was political acumen . Brooks Atkinson felt Behrman caught " the innermost truth of modern character " ; Joseph Wood Krutch thought he raised drawing room comedy to " comedy of illumination. " // Rather later , T. S. Eliot took the genre and gave it a still more improbable twist . His " Cocktail Party , " like " Aren ' t We All ? , " is a drawing-room comedy about the reconciliation of an estranged couple ; but even its lightest and most debonaire passages are written in verse , and the reconciliation itself has a spiritual significance. // That was 35 years ago . Is drawing-room comedy still with us in some other mutant form or forms ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drama briefly passed , the name given to the way certain 19th- and 20th-century playwrights treated subjects which predated and will survive them ? A bit of both , maybe . We ' re warier than we once were of the stilted logic of the well-made play and its children . We ' ve rejected the stilted values of the society drama and its progeny . We tend to be impatient with latter-day comedies of manners which expect us to feel a sycophantic **28;1651; frisson <> at the amours of the blue-blooded . Yet there always have been and always will be drama in which the romantic problems of the glamorous come entertainingly to a happy resolution . One finds it in abundance on television . One finds it on the stage , in guises old and new. // Shakespeare ' s " Much Ado about Nothing " wanders from streets to a bedroom , from gardens to a church ; but it could be classified as a pristine drawing-room comedy , given its cast of princes and lordlings , its loaded banter and amusing invective , its misunderstandings , reconciliations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have its Broadway last season , Tom Stoppard ' s " Real Thing . " Its drawing rooms admittedly prefer to call themselves living rooms , but they ' re classily enough furnished to merit the more pretentious name . Its main characters are those grandees of the meritocracy , an upscale playwright and an upscale actress . Their marriage has its teething troubles , but love carries them through it and looks in the end to have triumphed . There are no servants , but no doubt enough gadgetry in the kitchen to compensate . There ' s just one working-class character , a soldier turned amateur playwright , and his inferiority is made painfully apparent : When he becomes uppity and boorish , he ' s punished for his lack of savoir-faire by the lady protagonist , who throws an exemplary bowl of cheese dip in his face . And it is all very , very witty. // Of course , that ' s not all there is to the play . It is a most complex , thoughtful piece , far more intellectually sophisticated than anything Lonsdale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t We All ? " would surely have recognized the author of " The Real Thing " as a cousin , if one , two or three times removed . He ' d have sensed a kinship in Stoppard and , no doubt , in others , too . And if so , we can ' t yet confidently pronounce the drawing-room comedy an extinct species. //
