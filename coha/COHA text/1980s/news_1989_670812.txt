Now that Ms. Batchelder owns a shop called the Fishmonger in Cambridge , she poaches the salmon there , just as she does for her customers , and takes it to her mother ' s house in Beverly Farms where there are always about 20 people for lunch. // The Batchelders , like thousands of other New Englanders , are simply following a tradition begun by Abigail and John Adams on July 4 , 1776. // In the 18th century the meal began with turtle soup , which is pretty difficult to duplicate today , and most of us would not want egg sauce on our salmon - bechamel with chopped hard-cooked eggs . So changes have been made. // This stunning combination of salmon , sweet peas and new potatoes became a New England tradition simply because of seasonal availability. // In the days before the Industrial Revolution , when salmon was plentiful on the East Coast , it began to run in the early summer and continued into early fall . Peas and new potatoes were harvested at that time of year. // To this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the holiday . Alan Wulf , who owns Wulf ' s Fish Market in Boston , says he sells 200 to 300 pounds more the first week of July than at any other time of the season. // In " American Cooking : New England , " one of the series of Time-Life " Foods of the World " books , published in 1970 , the author , John Norton Leonard , a native New Englander , wrote about the traditional meal . It was his responsibility as a child to take care of the vegetable garden. // " The potato vines were far from mature and we all felt , New England-like , that none of them should be destroyed at this early stage of their growth . So with a small trowel I carefully loosened the soil around their roots and felt for the young potatoes , none of them bigger than golf balls and many much smaller . It was like feeling around for warm eggs under setting hens . Gently boiled in their tissue-thin skins and garnished with butter and chopped parsley , these delicate infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 20th-century Yankees Ms. Batchelder has made some changes in the original meal. // " I never grew up with egg sauce , " she said . " My mother used to coat the fish with mayonnaise , make scales from cucumbers and put a black olive in for the eye . I make a watercress-dill sauce. " // Ms. Batchelder ' s salmon poaching method is also different from the traditional technique . She bones the salmon first , then ties it both lengthwise and crosswise . After poaching she chills it , removes the skin and the fat and then it can easily be cut completely through both fillets , rather than the traditional way of slicing first one fillet than the other . Not only is it easier , it looks better. // Her red new potatoes are served with chives and butter ; the peas are steamed with mint and for dessert strawberry shortcake is served on a biscuit. // I rather doubt that Abigail Adams served apple pandowdy or Indian pudding for dessert as some articles suggest . Were there really apples that early in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heat up the kitchen for five or six hours in order to make Indian pudding ? // Strawberry shortcake makes more sense . The colonists found wild strawberries , and a version of strawberry shortcake was known in 1636 when Roger Williams , the founder of Rhode Island , wrote in " Keys to the Language of America , " " The Indians bruise them in a morter and mix them with meal and make strawberry bread. " // Of course the paradox of the Fourth of July salmon tradition is the scarcity of East Coast salmon . The damming of rivers , pollution from textile mills and municipal sewage wrecked the spawning ground , and by the early 1800 ' s the Industrial Revolution was having an effect on the Connecticut and Merrimac Rivers . The Androscoggin , Kennebec , Penobscot and St. Johns Rivers followed. // Only in recent years has there been a reversal of this trend . Every year there are reports that salmon are being seen farther up the Connecticut and Merrimac Rivers , but certainly not in large enough quantity for commercial fishing. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next two or three weeks comes from New Brunswick , Canada . This wild salmon is harvested by the Indians for a limited time . For the rest , we have to rely on farm-raised Norwegian salmon . The taste of farm-raised fish is never as full-bodied . East Coast salmon are richer and fattier than their West Coast cousins and some say the salmon from the West Coast are not even in the same league. // Whether the salmon comes from the East Coast , the West Coast or from Norway , serving it cold with a light sauce along with mint-flavored peas and new potatoes that cook in 10 minutes and following it with a strawberry shortcake is a perfect salute to the glorious Fourth . <> <> Red , White and Delicious Holiday Dessert <> <> Strawberry Shortcake <> <> Preparation time : 25 minutes <> <> Cooking time : 12 minutes <> <> 2 cups sifted unbleached flour <> 4 teaspoons baking powder <> 1 tablespoon sugar <> 4 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegetable shortening , plus butter to grease pans and spread on cakes <> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> 1/2 pint heavy cream. // 1 .
