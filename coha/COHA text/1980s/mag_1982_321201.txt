Reagan seeks to defuse the double-digit unemployment issue <P> Battle-ready Democrats could hardly wait for the announcement . White House tacticians decided that the President should not wait at all . Through the week , Ronald Reagan kept hinting at the impending news about unemployment , hoping to blunt the bad tidings by heralding them . Admitted a senior White House adviser : " We 've drawn attention to it and it wo n't be a big surprise . " <P> It was no big surprise , but it was disturbing . On Friday the Labor Department said the unemployment rate last month climbed from 9.8% to 10.1% , meaning that 11.3 million Americans are unable to find work . For the first time since 1940 , the percentage of U.S. unemployed reached double digits . Black unemployment crept above 20% , and for blue-collar workers the rate jumped from 14.2% to 15.6% . Among construction workers , unemployment rose to 22.6% . Friday was even given a nickname in advance : " Double-D-Day . " Said Richard Murray , a University of Houston political scientist : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've never seen so much ballyhoo . " <P> In one sense , the figure held more political than economic portent . After all 10.1% was a far cry from the depths of the Depression ; in 1933 , 24.9% of the labor force was out of work . But as a political rallying point , 10% is a memorably round number , a bench mark of national economic distress that Democrats hope and Republicans fear might turn voters agains the G.O.P. in the elections on Nov. 2 . <P> The Democrats may have been rejoicing in the opportunity to condemn Reaganomics , but in public they appeared appropriately anguished and angry , especially the would-be Presidents . In Los Angeles , at a Bethlehem Steel plant the company intends to close , former Vice President Walter Mondale told a crowd of steelworkers that " we 've gone beyond fat . We 're into bone and muscle . Now unemployment is cutting deeply into the heads of households . " Massachusetts Senator Edward Kennedy was no less impassioned . Said he : " This is a national tragedy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <P> Reagan 's principal defense was a grind-'em-down offense . In a speech at the University of Nevada 's Reno campus , he said of his Democratic critics : " Where were they when the economy first started going haywire ? What are they offering now except the same failed policies of the past ? We 're all paying the penalty of those tragic excesses . "
