Many women in their 40 ' s and 50 ' s grew up with the expectation that someone - typically a husband but sometimes a father - would always be around to take care of them . Most working women who have pursued careers and have chosen not to marry must acknowledge by middle age that , unless they have inherited wealth , they will be responsible for providing for themselves for the rest of their lives. // Many middle-aged homemakers who devoted their younger years raising a family are in a similar position . Now divorced , they can not count on their husbands for support and often find themselves with sole responsibility for the financial well-being of themselves and their children. // Here are some of the most important financial issues that women face . <> <> Work // Your principal investment is yourself . It is essential that all working women - whether secretaries or scientists , part-timers or five-day-a-week staffers - view their occupations as careers rather than simply as jobs . True , you may have casually taken the position you now hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help pay college tuition. // But because of persistent inflation and the odds that you will outlive or become divorced from your husband , the likelihood is that you will be working until retirement . And the extra commitment you make to your career now can pay off in extra dollars down the road. // Helen J. McLane , a vice president with Heidrick &; Struggles , a Chicago-based executive search firm , said one of the most common mistakes women make in business is to take a passive attitude toward their careers : " There are two sorts of people in the business world - those who are pro-active and attempt to control their destinies and those who are reactive and are buffeted by outside forces . While there are men as well as women in both camps , by and large there are more women in the reactive class. " // Miss McLane ' s advice to working women is to throw themselves wholeheartedly into their work . " A lot of people say you have to be ready when opportunity strikes , " she explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Among other things , that means making yourself more marketable and enhancing your skills . A real-estate agent , for example , might consider taking courses that would enable her to get a broker ' s license ( Miss McLane is taking a computer microprocessing course so she will not be an " electronic illiterate " ) . Or it could involve a long-term commitment to get an M.B.A. or law degree at night. // It also means taking the same time-honored route that successful men have long followed : working long hours , volunteering for extra assignments and being available for travel. // Hard work alone is not enough , according to Miss McLane . You also have to be willing to advertise your availability for promotion and to accept more demanding assignments when offered even if the work seems daunting at first . " Call it the Cinderella complex if you will , but women have traditionally hung back , waiting to be recognized and waiting to be chosen for an assignment , " she said . " But you have to push and press for additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance. " // The big thing to avoid is complacency . Even if you have a satisfying , well-paying job now , do not sit back and assume you are safe for the next 30 years . <> <> Disability Insurance // Once you have established a career and depend upon your income from it , be sure to safeguard that income should you become incapacitated . For most middle-aged workers the odds of being disabled for an extended period before retiring at age 65 are much greater than the odds of dying before that age. // Long-term disability insurance provides financial protection for the wage earners of a family and replaces some of the income lost because of illness or accident . " Every breadwinner needs disability insurance , " said George C. White , a New York City insurance agent and chartered life underwriter . It is especially important if you are a self-employed professional such as a doctor , lawyer or accountant. // While almost 90 million people have some sort of disability coverage , often through short-term group policies offered by their employers , only one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term disability policies and several other carriers , such as as Provident Life and Accident and Union Mutual , specialize in such coverage . Policy costs vary widely , depending on age , sex and occupation. // When you shop for a policy , look for one that has guaranteed renewability . This means that the carrier can not cancel your insurance as long as you pay the premium even if you develop serious health problems that make you a bad risk . Although rates can be increased , a carrier can not single out an individual for a higher rate ; premiums can only be raised for a given class of policyholders ( of similar age , sex , income or occupation ) , depending on claims experience with them . If your policy is also noncancelable , the company can not change the premium and benefits for a designated period. // Be prepared , nevertheless , to pay more for the same amount of protection than if you were a man . Actuarial statistics indicate that while a woman tends to live longer than a man , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The outlook for the older American woman is grim . Nine of 10 women become widows and about one woman in three over the age of 65 is living below the poverty level , according to the Pension Rights Center , a public-interest research group in Washington. // Every woman should expect , then , to be alone in her old age and should begin building a nest egg early enough so that her retirement years will be comfortable financially . By all means establish an Individual Retirement Account , stashing away up to $2 , 000 a year and watching it compound tax-free . If you can afford it make your taxdeductible contribution as early in the year as possible so it can earn the maximum interest. // A couple with one wage earner can open a " spousal " I.R.A. for the nonworking spouse - typically the wife - and the maximum amount the family can save annually rises to $2 , 250 . New rules also permit a nonworking divorced wife to contribute to a spousal I.R.A. after divorce. // But I.R.A. ' s alone will probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will most likely have to be supplemented by a savings program as well as by a company pension. // Because it is far better to determine whether gaps exist in your retirement coverage while you still have time to make up the deficiency , start asking questions now. // First , find out whether you are covered by a pension at work ( sometimes companies do not have to cover those who start at a late age ) . If you are covered , ask the pension plan administrator - in large companies typically the personnel director - for a pension booklet . It tells how long you must work to become vested - that is , to earn the right to receive a pension at retirement even if you leave the company beforehand . If you want to know at what age you can receive your pension , and how much it is going to be , ask for an individual benefit statement . Every worker is entitled to such a statement once a year if a request is made in writing. // For an excellent guide to the ins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Understanding Your Pension , " available for $2 from the Pension Rights Center , 1346 Connecticut Ave .

Otherwise the entire estate will go to the next of kin according to the laws of the state in which the deceased resided. // " The survivor of an unmarried couple has no automatic right to the property of the other the way a surviving spouse does , and the property could wind up going to Aunt Tillie , whom the deceased hadn ' t seen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with families need wills to specify the guardians of their children and the ages at which they should receive the estates . Normally , the surviving parent receives physical custody of the children as guardian of their " person , " said Mary Lovett Nitsch , a New York City estate lawyer . She added : " But many women don ' t realize that they can name another individual in their wills to act as guardian of the ' property ' to administer any funds the children may inherit from them . You ' d be surprised how many people are delighted when they learn about this because they often don ' t trust their ex-spouse to use the funds for the benefit of their children.
