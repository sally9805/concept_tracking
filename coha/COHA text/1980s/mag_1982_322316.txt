Sales accelerate , but the automakers still have a long way back <P> Of all the tonics that would help revive the sagging U.S. economy , few would be more potent than a turnaround for the long-depressed American auto industry . For that reason , the news out of Detroit last week was especially encouraging . The automakers announced that May sales of American-built cars surged 11% from the same period a year ago . <P> The figures stirred hopes that the auto industry , which has lost nearly $6 billion since 1979 and laid off roughly 250,000 workers , may be poised , at last , for a rebound . Says General Motors Vice Chairman Howard Kehrl : " The market seems to have strength again . " Chrysler Chairman Lee lacocca believes his slimmed-down company may be able to turn a profit of close to $100 million in the April-June quarter , compared with an operating loss of $89 million in the first three months of the year . <P> Wall Street analysts , however , are more cautious . " I do n't think we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Maryann Keller of the Paine Webber investment firm . Even after an upbeat May , auto sales for the year so far are 36% less than during the same months in 1978 . The automakers continue to confront the problems that first triggered their prolonged slump : high interest rates , a weak economy and fierce competition from Japanese imports . Says Fran McCormack , general manager of Clayton Motors Dodge in East Hartford , Conn. : " There are obviously a lot of people who need to replace their cars who are still waiting for interest rates to come down . People live and breathe those rates . " <P> May 's showroom traffic was spurred by a razzle-dazzle assortment of rebates , financing deals and warranties that the car companies say they can not afford to keep offering forever . GM garnered a 22% sales increase by giving customers 12.8% financing , which was far more attractive than the 17% auto loans available at banks . That offer has now expired , however , and GM sales may slow again as a result . Says Analyst David Healy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June could be pretty wobbly without an incentive program at GM . " <P> The other companies , which were too financially weak to match GM 's 12.8% deal , scored much smaller gains . Ford , with a sales rise of 1.3% , offered rebates of 5% on the price of most models and a broad two-year warranty for maintenance and repair costs on all of its cars . Chrysler 's warranty , which is good for five years or 50,000 miles , helped boost sales 4.8% . To promote these gimmicks , the companies launched costly advertising campaigns . It became almost impossible to watch television without hearing Telly ( Kojak ) Savalas hawk Fords or Chrysler 's Iacocca growl : " If you can find a better car , buy it . "
