" This is not a happy story . I warn you . " So begins one of the ten taut , laconic tales that make up Rock Springs , and the same admonition could serve equally well for the other nine . All of them concern characters who suspect that they may be helpless spectators of their own lives . They move about , theoretically of their own volition , but the trajectories they plot sink inexorably downward , beyond their control . Muses one of them : " There was always a gap between my plan and what happened , and I only responded to things as they came along and hoped I would n't get in trouble . " <P> Such self-knowledge raises these stories well above the level of the merely unhappy . Author Richard Ford , 43 , has the ability to convey the drama of aimless , drifting , passive people , the suspense entailed in waiting each day to see what new misfortunes the world has in store . In Sweethearts , a man named Russell drives his girlfriend 's ex-husband Bobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing bad checks . Russell does not think he will ever stumble into a similar fate , but he tries to understand what happened to Bobby : " Somehow , and for no apparent reason , your decisions got tipped over and you lost your hold . And one day you woke up and you found yourself in the very situation you said you would never be in , and you did not know what was important to you anymore . And after that , it was all over . " <P> The characters ' sense of insignificance is reinforced by their surroundings . The locales in Rock Springs are almost entirely Montana and environs , a vast landscape where mountains appear in the distance " maybe 50 miles away or maybe a hundred . " Such vistas seem intended to make humans feel puny , to mock the notion that individuals can make an impression on so much immensity . In Children , two teenage boys spend a day with a girl who is passing through , running away from home . That night , after putting her on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Outside was a place that seemed not even to exist , an empty place you could stay in for a long time and never find a thing you admired or loved or hoped to keep . And we were unnoticeable in it  --  both of us . " <P> Yet Ford 's people are not entirely immune to the stark beauty around them . One man , driving a stolen Mercedes and hoping to get far away from Montana , still takes time to appreciate the setting sun : " Just as it touched the rim of the horizon , it all at once fired the air into jewels and red sequins the precise likes of which I had never seen before and have n't seen since . " In Communist , a boy is taken hunting by his mother 's lover and , in the process , shown the sights and sounds of something marvelous : " It was a thing to see , I will tell you now . Five thousand white geese all in the air around you , making a noise like you have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is something I will never see again . I will never forget this . And I was right . " <P> Such language is both purposefully prosaic and incandescent . The Sportswriter ( 1986 ) , Ford 's highly acclaimed third novel , established a glittering reputation . The stories in Rock Springs confirm it . P.G .
