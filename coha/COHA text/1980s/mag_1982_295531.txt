Defiant Begin <P> To the Editors : <P> <P> Menachem Begin Sept. 20 has said , " A friend does not weaken his friend . " Begin 's actions have weakened the U.S. in the Middle East , especially with the moderate Arab states . Before Begin accuses the U.S. of not being a true friend , he should look at his own actions . <P> Kenneth E. Morris <P> Coffeyville , Kans . <P> The Arab League still refuses to recognize Israel 's right to exist ; yet you imply that Prime Minister Begin is the foremost obstacle to peace in the Middle East . <P> Amy and Dan Goldberger <P> Mountain View , Calif . <P> <P> What right has Begin to demand that the world bow to his dictates for bringing back a biblical Israel ? If it were n't for the help the U.S. gives Israel , Begin would not have a country to defend . <P> Al Hoenicke <P> Sterling Heights , Mich . <P> As an American of Jewish descent , I am disgusted by Israel 's acts of the past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oppressor , but if it looks , walks and quacks like a duck and has feathers , well ? <P> John H. Cone <P> Pasadena , Calif . <P> As a Jew who recalls the silence of a Pope and the indifference of President Roosevelt while 6 million of my people were burning , the choice for me is simple . <P> Rabbi Esor Winer Ben-Sorek <P> Great Neck , N. Y. <P> More than any other group , Jews ought to be sympathetic to the Palestinian plea for a homeland . The Palestinians do not want to be scattered over the Middle East any more than the Jews wanted to remain dispersed throughout Europe . <P> Mary Hanna <P> Berkeley , Calif . <P> <P> Remembrances of Things Past <P> I agree with your Essay Sept. 20 that Israel can not dwell forever on the Holocaust and use that tragedy as its motivating force . However , the Israelis would do well to keep attuned to the guns and bombs going off at synagogues in Paris , Brussels and Vienna . <P> Helen W. Joffe <P> Hamilton , Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to survive when other nations would crumple . It is a history to be borne with sadness and pride . However , Prime Minister Begin is creating a past that may not be remembered with pride . He could prove to be the next disaster for the Jews . <P> Stephanie Vincent <P> Burlington , Ont . <P> Since time immemorial the Jews have risen from the ashes , standing yet stronger in their beliefs . How else could they have survived , if not for their devotion to the past ? In every Jew , including American Jews , is the remembrance of those who came before and of their trust that tradition will be carried on . <P> Ellen Barson <P> Hamden , Conn . <P> Anti-Semitism has existed for centuries in Western civilization . Its culmination in the Holocaust occurred only 40 years ago . Has the Western world become so morally transformed since then that anti-Semitism is no longer a threat to the Jewish people ? I doubt it . <P> Lawrence M. Rubin <P> Tonawanda , N. Y. <P> <P> Doing Time     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
