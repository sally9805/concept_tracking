, full pink lips , natural long blond hair , rounded breasts , a handspan waist , narrow rear , and endless legs . There was nothing trampy or obvious about her startling good looks . As usual she wore very little makeup , and a simple outfit of pink sweater and baggy white overalls . It did not stop the stares . Slowly she guided her cart down the crowded aisles , stopping occasionally to check out the prices . Hmmm , she thought , Safeway or not , everything sure costs a lot . All she had was thirty-five dollars , and that was supposed to keep her and Buddy going for a week . She smiled when she thought of him . She blushed when she thought of them in bed together that very morning . His hands everywhere , his tongue exploring hidden places . Thinking about him gave her the shivers . He was so wonderful and worldly . So good-looking . She shivered again . He was her husband and had been for two great and glorious days . " Hi , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in a red open-necked shirt and carefully pressed pants . " Did n't we meet the other night at a party ? " he asked , edging around the side of her cart until he was standing quite close . " I 'm sorry , " she said quickly , " but I only got into town yesterday . " Now why was she apologizing ? Buddy had told her about it a hundred and one times . Do n't go around saying " Sorry " to everyone . You got ta learn to be more aggressive in life . " Well , " the man said , " If you only got into town yesterday maybe I can buy you dinner tonight . Whaddya say to that ? " " I 'm sor  --  " she began , then quickly stopped herself . " I 'm married , " she stated primly . He laughed suggestively . " I do n't mind if you do n't . " Why did they always have to pick on her ? Ever since she could remember , strange men had been sidling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the movies . Everywhere . She pushed the cart firmly down the aisle , hoping to lose him , but he followed , mumbling one or the other of a hundred tired lines . She stopped and fixed him with her devastating eyes . " Please leave me alone , " she murmured softly . " I told you , I 'm married , and my husband would n't like you talking to me . He would n't like it one little bit . " She had not meant it as a threat . But it seemed to work , and the man retreated . Buddy did hate other men looking at her . If he only knew how they40approached her all the time , he would go crazy . But it was n't her fault , was it ? She never wore form-fitting clothes or short skirts . She kept to herself and never gave any of them an inch of encouragement . Buddy was the first man who had ever done more than kiss her goodnight , and that was only since their marriage . Instinctively she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appreciation on their wedding night had been worth all the slapped hands and frustrations of her past . How very lucky she was to have found him . He was a man in a million . " Excuse me , miss , " mumbled a tall gangly boy in a torn baseball shirt , " but I think you dropped these . " She stared blankly at the box of crackers he held out . " I 'm sorry , they 're not mine , " she apologized . " No ? I thought I saw them drop off your cart . " " Sorry . " He nervously scratched at a pimple . " If I get in front of you in the line I can help you take all your junk out to your car . " " No , thank you . " She moved quickly down the aisle . Safeway was teeming with them . Maybe next time Buddy would come with her . Frances Cavendish leaned back in the chair behind her modem chrome desk and sucked greedily on a joint cunningly fitted into a roach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs for a count of ten , then exhaled with a deep sigh of obvious satisfaction . She did not offer the contraption to Buddy Hudson , who slouched moodily on the other side of the desk , uncomfortable on a small straight-backed chair . " You 've got your goddam nerve walking in here , " she said . " Huh ? " " Do n't act like you do n't know what I 'm talking about . I got you that TV pilot , and with the help of that old crone you were shacked up with you blew the whole thing . " " Hey , Frances . That was then . Now I need a job . I really do . I just got married . " " Sorry , Buddy . " She waved her hand dismissively . " But you must know how it is right now . Things are tight . I ca n't help you . " She could help him if she wanted to . She was one of the most powerful casting agents in town . " Hey , Frances , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have n't got anything ? This is Buddy Boy you 're rappin ' with . I thought we had somethin ' special . " Frances picked up a pair of rhinestone-trimmed glasses and perched them on her long pointed nose . " Did n't you just tell me you got married ? " 41 " Yeah . " " Well , dear boy , I do think that makes a difference to our  --  relationship . Do n't you ? " What relationship ? He had escorted her to a few events . She had thrown a little work his way . It was n't as if he had ever balled her . " Why ? " he demanded sulkily , wishing he had never told her . She glared at him . " I have n't seen you for eight months . Then you just amble in here and casually announce you 're married . What makes you think I should give you special treatment ? " He stood . " So do n't . " She took off her glasses and narrowed flinty eyes . Buddy Hudson was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a shame just to let him walk out . " I can send you up for a commercial , " she sighed . " I do n't want to do any more commercials . I 've been in Hawaii for six months singing up a storm  --  they could n't get enough of me there . What I want now is a classy guest shot on some television show . Little acting , little singing , I 'll knock ' em on their fat-cat asses . " Frances picked up a pen and tapped it impatiently on her desk . " You want to go for a commercial or not ? " He thought about his situation . Two hundred bucks to his name , a beat-up old Pontiac , and a one-room apartment off the Strip he had borrowed from a friend . Some situation . And a wife of two days named Angel . Beautiful , soft , innocent , and all his . He had brought her back from Hawaii like a conqueringhero . She thought he was a successful actor with jobs lining up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in their married life . " Yeah , I 'll go , " he decided . She scribbled something on a card and handed it to him . " Four o'clock tomorrow . Do n't be late . " He glanced at the card , then back at her . " Frances , " he said , " are n't you at least going to give me a toke ? " Angel sang softly to herself as she unpacked the groceries . She could hardly believe how happy she was. , So much had happened in such a short period of time . And everything had fallen into position perfectly . To think  --  that only a year and a half earlier she had graduated from high school in Louisville , Kentucky , gotten a job as a receptionist in a beauty salon , and one day entered a competition in a movie magazine . In her wildest dreams she had never imagined winning . But she had , and the prize was a thousand dollars and a week 's paid trip to Hollywood with a companion. 42Hollywood . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A dream come true ! Without hesitation she packed a bag and headed west with her best girlfriend , Sue-Ann . Taking off was no problem . Angel was a foster child in a large family , and the extra space in the small house they all shared was more than welcome . A week in Hollywood at the Hyatt Hotel on the famous Sunset Boulevard . She and Sue-Ann barely had time to catch their breath . The magazine arranged for them to be photographed doing everything from exploring Disneyland to lunching with Burt Reynolds . Burt Reynolds ! Angel thought she would faint . But he was very nice and made her laugh  --  even put his arms around her and Sue-Ann for a photo . The week raced by , and when it was over she did not want to return to dull old Louisville . There were no real ties to pull her back . The family she lived with had never mistreated her , but she had always felt like an outsider , an intruder , sometimes no more than just a maid . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry for everyone , but as she reached puberty and her beauty developed , she was resented more and more by the family . Getting away had been on her mind for as long as she could remember , and this seemed like the perfect opportunity . " I 'm going to stay , " she told Sue-Ann , her eyes shining with the light of the converted . " This is where I belong . I 'm going to be an actress ! " Sue-Ann argued with her friend , but to no avail . Angel had made up her mind . After all , every man she met in Hollywood had told her that she should be in the movies , so why not give it a try ? She had the thousand dollars prize money , and if she was careful it should last her for several months at least . First of all , she needed somewhere to live , for she had no plans to waste money staying on at the hotel . The photographer gave her the number of a girl he knew who rented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winking . " An ' do n't forget , beautiful , if she 's got no bed for you there 's always a place in mine . " She ignored his suggestive remark , called , and within an hour was installed in the back room of a large rambling house off Fairfax . " Two minutes from May Company an ' a block from Farmers Market . How lucky can you get ? " asked the flashy redhead who rented out . " You new in town , honey ? " She nodded . " I 'm going to be an actress . " 43 " Sure you are . An ' the Pope got married yesterday . " " What ? " " Forget it . " Becoming an actress was not easy , but who had ever said it would be ? First she found out that she needed photographs and an agent , and then Daphne , the redhead , told her , " Ya got ta join some kinda stupid union . Sure ya wan na bother ? There 's easier ways of makin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She trailed off and stared . Professional photographs cost a hundred dollars , although the photographerdid suggest there were ways she could pay other than cash . She pretended she did n't know what he was talking about . After visiting several agents she decided on a fatherly type with an office on Sunset . He seemed better than the younger ones who she instinctivelyknew would be trouble . In six weeks he sent her on four interviews , none resulting in a job , but plenty of propositions . He then said he could get her the second lead in a porno movie , and she left his office in tears . " Dirty old bastard , " Daphne sympathized . " Tell you what , I 'm gon na treat ya to a trip to Hawaii , all expenses paid . " " What about your job ? " Angel asked tentatively . Daphne had told her she was some kind of sales representative , always running off to appointmentsday and night . " Screw the job . I need a vacation . " Angel could hardly believe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What did it matter if she wore too much makeup and flashy clothes ? She was a nice person . And , anyway , the chance to visit Hawaii was too tempting to turn down . They arrived late at night after a turbulent flight . A twenty-minute cab ride took them straight from the airport to the Hawaiian Village Hotel . Daphne , who had managed to consume quite a few drinks on the fivehourjourney , fell into a drunken sleep . Angel paid the cab fare and shook her awake , all the while staring excitedly around . " Shit ! " mumbled Daphne . " We here already ? " Angel glanced at the cab driver to see if he had heard , but he stared impassively ahead . They entered the lobby and approached the reception desk . " You go in an ' sit down while I register , " Daphne instructed . She waited patiently , wishing that her friend would n't drink so much , would maybe cut down on the swearing . Still , she was n't in Louisville anymore . Daphne was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the world and free. 44 " All set ! " Daphne swooped down on her . " Honey , I am one tired person . Let 's hit the old sack right away . " The room was clean , with color television , a view over the pool , and a double bed . Angel hardly relished the thought of sharing . The heavy perfume Daphne wore failed to conceal her pungent body odor . " Give the guy a tip , " Daphne ordered , indicating the bellboy who was placing their two suitcases on the floor . Angel fished in her purse , thinking that her money was not lasting as long as she had hoped . Out of the thousand dollars she had only four hundred left . She gave the boy a dollar , which did n't seem to thrill him . By the time he was out of the room Daphne had stripped off her red dress and was heading for the bathroom clad only in a pair of brief purple panties . Angel did not see how she could object to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small sigh , opened up her suitcase , and took out the blue baby-doll nightdress she had purchased at the May Company . Her one extravagance , but it was so pretty she had been unable to resist it . Daphne emerged from the bathroom stark naked , placed both hands on her hips , and shimmied her large breasts . " Not bad , huh ? An ' all mine ! " Angel hurried into the bathroom , where she showered , reflecting that maybe coming to Hawaii had n't been such a good idea after all . Back in the bedroom all was quiet . Daphne was under the sheets with the lights off . Angel crept into the other side of the bed , closed her eyes , and thought about her attempts at becoming an actress . She had to get a job to keep her afloat . Perhaps she could be a receptionist in a film studio , or maybe Burt Reynolds needed a secretary . Or Richard Gere . Or ... At first , the hand creeping up her leg was just an irritation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand dived between her thighs and suddenly Daphne was upon her . " Oh , no ! " she gasped in shock . " What are you doing ! " " I ai n't playin ' tennis , hon , " replied Daphne , trying to ease her fingers under the tight elastic of Angel 's panties . " Stop it ! Stop it at once ! " She kicked out . " Oh , a playful chickie , huh ? Tell you the truth I ai n't averse to a few games myself . " The elastic tore , and Daphne 's fingers were quick to touch the warm triangle of fluff . " Will you stop it ! " screamed Angel , scrambling from the bed . " What 's the matter with you ? " 45 " What 's the matter with me ? Why the heck do you think I brought you here ? " " For a vacation , " she stammered shakily . " For a fuck , sweetheart . For a little bit of soft pussy instead of hard cock . " Angel 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I feel sick . " " Go puke somewhere else , " blazed Daphne . " If you do n't want to play , just take your bag an ' get the hell out . " " But ... I 've got nowhere to go . " Daphne was not interested . " Tough tit , " she spat . Fifteen minutes later Angel stood forlornly in the lobby pleading with a surly desk clerk , who told her repeatedly that there were no vacant rooms in the hotel . Buddy Hudson , fresh from an energetic scene with an Australian tourist , could not help noticing the delectable blonde . He checked out women automatically , and this one was something . When she turned away from the reservation desk he moved in . " Trouble ? " he asked sympathetically . She gazed at him and quite literally felt her legs go weak . " Oh ! " she murmured . " Oh  --  what ? Trouble or no trouble ? " He had to have this one , she was Christmas six months early . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She could n't stop staring . Buddy Hudson was the handsomest man she had ever seen . He was a combination of her two favorite movie stars Richard Gere and John Travolta  --  but better than both , with tight black curly hair , smoky ebony eyes , and a body that was both muscular and thin . " Hey  --  hey . That 's not good . Did n't you make a reservation in advance ? This is tourist-seasonville. " " 1 did , but ... " Her eyes brimmed with tears . " I just had the most horrible experience I ever had in my entire life ! " This was going to be easy . " Want to talk about it ? " " I could n't ! " " Sure you could . Talking always helps . Come on , I 'll buy you a drink . " He guided her to a nearby lounge , where the waitress greeted him by name . " What 'll it be ? " he asked , wondering how long it would take to get her into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a shot of rum to liven it up ? " " Plain . " He looked surprised . " You do n't drink ? " She shook her head. 46 " Smoke ? " Again she shook her head . He wondered if he dared . No . Why even make a joke of it  --  they all did . " So , " he began , " tell me what happened . Some creep giving you a hard time ? " She did n't know why she trusted him , she just did . Soon she was confiding everything that had happened to her from the moment she first set foot in Hollywood to her recent vile scene with Daphne . " I feel so dirty , " she said quietly . " Can you imagine a girl wanting to do something like that ? " Could he imagine ? Oh boy , if he only had a buck for all the chicks he 'd watched making it together . This little fox was either putting him on or she was a real innocent . " I got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quickly she remember he was a man . And men only wanted One Thing . " No thank you . " He did n't push , just said mildly , " You have to park it somewhere for tonight . " " No , I do n't . I 'm going to the airport to wait for a plane back to Los Angeles . " " That 's the dumbest thing I ever heard . " " Why ? " " Because , sugar , you are here on one of the most beautiful islands in the world . And I am not letting you go anywhere until I have personally shown you around . " " But  --  " He placed a finger on her lips . " No buts . I have a friend who owns a small hotel . We 'll get you a room there . " " But  --  " " Rule one . Never argue with Buddy Boy . " Three weeks sped by , and true to his word Buddy showed her the island . Not only did he give her a guided tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tourist shuttle plane took them on day trips to Maui , Lanai , and Molokai . They explored white deserted beaches , coral reefs alive with exotic tropical fish , rain forests , and the dramatic Paradise Park . Angel had never felt so excited and alive . Buddy called up feelings in her she had not known existed . Installed in a pleasant room at his friend 's hotel , she waited anxiously each day for him to pick her up . He tried a few times to get her to spend the night at his place , but each time she47explained very carefully that she was n't " that kind of girl . " He laughed when she said that . But his laughter did not weaken her resolve , although secretly she had to admit that she did want him . She yearned for his hard strong body to possess her totally . When he kissed her goodnight it took every ounce of willpower to push him away . Buddy sang in a piano bar . " I 'm really an actor , " he explained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. , an ' I 've been down here a few months . I was working nonstop in Hollywood . Y'know  --  movies , television shows . You name it , I 've been on it . " " Really ? " She was impressed . " Sure . Did n't you recognize me when we first met ? " She shook her head . " I do n't watch much television . " " Ha ! An ' I thought that 's why you let me talk to you in the first place . I 'm famous , kid ! " He allowed her , only once , in the place where he worked . She sat at the bar gazing lovingly at him while he warbled everything from " My Way " to " Chicago . " " They like the old-fashioned stuff , " he explained rather sheepishly . " My real bag 's more Billy Joel and rock . But I got ta make a buck . " One day , lying on a quiet beach , he rolled over on top of her and began kissing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know you 're drivin ' me crazy , " he muttered . " No way can I go on like this . " She could feel his hardness digging into her thigh , and instinctively her body pushed toward his . " Oh , baby ! " he mumbled , burying his head in her golden hair . " Oh , baby ... baby ... baby ... 1 got to have you . You understand what I 'm sayin ? Got to . " She wanted him as much as he wanted her . He was everything she had ever dreamed of and more . He could be the family she never had . Someone to care for . Someone who would look after her . Someone to belong to . " We could get married , " she whispered timidly . He backed off . Fast . Then later he reconsidered . So what was so terrible about marrying the most beautiful girl in the world ? " You got it , kid , " he told her , and a week later they were married . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel in a white lace dress she purchased with the last of her money . " You know what ? " Buddy announced excitedly , the day after their wedding . " We 're headin ' back to Hollywood . You and me , kid  --  that 's where we 're both gon na make it so big they wo n't even know what 's hit ' em ! " Dreamily Angel finished unpacking the groceries and hoped that Buddy would approve of what she was fixing for dinner . Hamburgers , green beans , baked potatoes , and apple pie . She smiled softly to herself and thought about after dinner . She and Buddy alone together . In bed together . Making love together . Thank you , Daphne . You changed my life and made me the happiest girl in the world ! Buddy was able to jazz Frances up to at least smiling before he left her office . She even let him have a couple of drags on her joint . Not enough to get him high  --  but who needed drugs with Angel in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of adrenaline , enough to take him right through the day with no trouble at all . Who would have thought Buddy Hudson would ever get himself caught ? Not him for sure . Buddy Hudson . Answer to every girl 's prayers . Stud . Hero . Superstar . Well , jeez  --  if he did n't think positive , who would ? One of these days he 'd make it . One of these days . Buddy Hudson . Twenty-six years old . Brought up in San Diego by a mother who adored him , perhaps too much . She kept him by her side at all times and only relinquished her hold to allow him to attend school . When he was twelve his father died , and although they were left in good financial shape his mother was distraught . " You will have to look after Mommy now , " she wailed . " You must be my big big man . " Young as he was , her words frightened him . Her closeness was already oppressive , and now with his father gone it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he share her bed at night . " I 'm frightened , " was her excuse . He hated the way she stifled him , and looked forward to school and a friend named Tony , who also had problems at home . The two of them fantasized about getting a little freedom . " Why do n't we make a break for it ? " Tony suggested one day . The idea appealed to Buddy . He was already fourteen , tall and well built , with a strong desire to get out into the world and see what was going on . " Yeah , " he agreed . " Let 's do it . " A few days later he borrowed twenty dollars from his mother 's purse and during lunch recess he and Tony skipped out of school . They:aced down the street laughing and yelling with relief . " What should we do ? " Buddy asked . Tony shrugged . " I du n no . Whaddya think we should do ? " Buddy shrugged . " I dunna . " Finally they decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hot . The movie was The Thomas Crown Affair , and Buddy fell in love with Faye Dunaway , and decided that if Steve McQueen could be an actor , why could n't he ? The seeds of ambition were firmly planted . They rolled out of the movie with no clear idea where to spend the night , and found themselves drifting down toward the harbor . Buddy thought about his mother alone in her big bed . He was n't sorry , just delighted that he had managed to escape . They hung around outside a bar , bumming cigarettes from emergingsailors , until eventually an older man in civilian clothes approached them . " You want to go to a party ? " he asked , his small eyes darting shiftily . Buddy looked at Tony , and Tony looked at him , and they both noddedenthusiastically . " Follow me , " said the man , walking down the street to a large foreign car . The two boys jumped obediently into the back seat . " I think it 's a Rolls-Royce , " Tony whispered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . Now that the man had the boys in his car , he ignored them , and drove silently and swiftly . After about ten minutes Buddy leaned forward and tapped him on the shoulder . " Excuse me , mister , where exactly is this party ? " The man braked sharply . " If you want to get out , say so now . Nobody 's forcing you to go anywhere . Just remember that . " The words made Buddy uneasy . He nudged Tony . " Let 's split , " he whispered . " No , " argued Tony . " We got nowhere else to go . " Very true . Suddenly Buddy wished he was home . Only he could n't lose face and let Tony know that . Another ten minutes or so and they pulled into a private driveway , then finally slid to a stop in front of a brightly lit mansion . The drive was full of other expensive cars . " Whew ! " Tony whistled . " Some place ! " " Follow me , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spacious hallway . " What are your names ? " he asked . " I 'm Tony , he 's Buddy , " Tony replied amiably . " And we 're both real hungry . Any food ? " " All in good time . This way . " He threw open double doors to a sunken living room filled with people . The room was abuzz with conversation and the clink of glasses . They stood in the doorway until they were noticed and the noise tapered off . " Gentlemen , " their escort announced formally , " I 'd like you to meet Tony and Buddy . " Every eye in the room fixed upon them , and there was deathly silence for only a moment . " No sailors , Freddie ? " An effeminate voice broke the hush , and laughter filled the room . A short butterball of a man in a bright-orange kaftan detached himself from a group and approached them holding out a bejeweled hand . " Welcome to my party , boys . What can I get you ? " Tony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , grinning , loving every minute of their adventure . Buddy still felt uneasy . However , he allowed himself to be drawn into the room along with Tony , realizing it was too late to make an escape . Besides , when he got a load of the table full of delicious food he was n't sure that he still wanted to . They were given drinks . Not hard liquor , but frothy concoctions in tall glasses that tasted more like milkshakes than anything else . Then they were served plates of rich food . Everyone fussed around them  --  not like they were a couple of kids but nicely , asking their opinion on this and that , filling their glasses whenever they were half empty , and giving them cigarettes . After a while Buddy felt pretty good . " Here , try this . " Butterball passed him a different kind of cigarette . He managed only a short drag before Tony grabbed it from him and said , " Is that grass ? Let me try it . " Butterball smiled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , drew deeply on the cigarette , then began to cough frantically . Butterball laughed aloud , and even the man who had picked them up allowed himself a smirk . Tony 's eyes narrowed as he dragged on the cigarette again , this time managing not to choke , holding the smoke in his lungs for a while , then exhaling triumphantly . " You learn fast , " murmured Butterball . " Sure 1 do , " boasted Tony . " What else you got for me to try ? " Butterball 's eyes gleamed . " Are you big enough to sample a little cocaine ? " " I 'm big enough to sample anything ! " By this time Buddy felt distinctly sick . " Got ta go to the bathroom , " he mumbled , staggering from the room . Nobody took any notice . Tony was the center of attention as he prepared to snort the white powder Butterball lined up on a glass table . Buddy found the can and took an endless pee . The relief was great , but he still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open window at the back . What he needed was a few big gulps of fresh air . He opened the window wide and leaned out . Coordination deserted him , and before50 51he knew what was happening he lost his balance and fell , landing hard on a patch of grass . He remembered nothing more until awakening in the early hours of the next morning , the daylight harsh in his eyes , his body stiff and cramped . He had no idea where he was . Panic swept through him . His head throbbed and the taste in his mouth was disgusting . Desperately he tried to think as he stood up in the unkempt garden and looked around . Tony . Me and Tony . Running away . The movies . The harbor . Man in car . Faggots . Food . Drink . My mother will kill me . For sure she will kill me . He brushed down his clothes and made his way around the front of the house . There were no cars in the driveway . The place was deserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dilapidated , not at all the magnificent mansion of the previous evening . He frowned . The front door was locked , but he was able to peer through a window and was amazed to see the few pieces of furniture in sight covered with dust sheets . The place looked as if nobody had lived there in months . He hung around , hoping that Tony would show up , all the while skirting around the house searching for a place of entry . But everything was securely locked . Tony had obviously split  --  and why not ? He probably thought Buddy had run out on him . Suddenly running away did not seem like such a smart idea anymore . Not when you were on your own , cold , tired , and hungry . His mother would kill him , but returning home was the only answer . He set off in what he hoped was the right direction . The events of the next twenty-four hours still haunted him .

He was taken to the police station and grilled for seven hours straight , until his mother managed to drag him out of there with the help of the family lawyer . He was taken home and given a sedative and slept for ten hours . Then the cops were back , requesting that he guide them to the house where the party had taken place . He was driven around in a squad car for hours , but he could n't remember where it was . " Are you sure there was a party ? " questioned a suspicious detective . " Are you certain there was a house ?

A steel locker in the wall was pulled out , and there lay Tony , naked and dead , his lifeless body covered with purple bruises and weals . Buddy stared , unable to believe that he was being made to look . Then he started to cry , great racking sobs . " I 'm gon na throw up , " he mumbled . " Get me out of here , please ! Get me away .

Where before , life with his mother had been smothering , now it was impossible . She did not leave him alone for a second , forever smoothing his hair back , stroking his face , clinging to his hand . He slept uneasily in her bed , keeping as far away as he could from her fussing petting hands . She questioned him constantly . " Did those men try to put their things near you ? " " Did they undress you ? " " You know it 's not normal  --  two men together . " How dumb did she think he was ? He knew it was n't normal . In fact , he knew what was normal .

He wanted to ask her for a date , but it was impossible . His mother allowed him no freedom , and when he complained , she just fixed him with a hurt expression and mournfully said , " Remember Tony ? " So it was down to grabbing what opportunities he could . Tina was not averse to his attentions , for Buddy was certainly the best-looking boy in52 53school . They indulged in heavy petting sessions during lunch recess in the science lab , which was never used at that time of day . Tina had pert breasts that he loved to feel , and in return she massaged him to orgasm on a pile of Kleenex . " I think I love you , Buddy , " Tina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think I love you , too , " he dutifully replied , hoping that this meant she was finally going to let him " do it . " He had her blouse and bra off , and now he fiddled with the catch on her skirt while she gazed passionately into his eyes . Her skirt dropped to the floor and quickly she said , " I 've never done this before . Have you ? " " No , " he replied truthfully , rapidly pulling down her panties before she changed her mind . " Oh ! " She shivered . " Take your clothes . off too . " She did n't have to ask him twice . He was so excited he felt he might ejaculate there and then before he even got it in . He pulled down his pants and ripped off his shirt . Neither of them heard the principal enter with two sets of parents he was showing around the school . Many recriminations later , his mother arrived to collect him , her mouth set in a thin , furious line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy home in silence . Once at home he escaped to his room . At least his mother would not want him in her bed tonight . He had never seen her so angry . He undressed and climbed into the narrow bed he was so rarely allowed to use . His stomach ached and he thought about Tina , allowing his hands to travel beneath the covers and play with his erection . The light was switched on so suddenly his hands froze , as did his hard- on . His mother stood in the doorway , clad in a long robe , her cheeks flushed , her dark eyes glowing . " So , " she murmured huskily , " you wanted to see what a woman 's body looks like , did you ? Well , see then . " With one gesture she shucked off her robe and stood before him naked . His own mother ! He was shocked and horrified , and even worse  --  aroused . She walked toward the bed and ripped the covers down . His new erection could hardly be hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confused . He wanted to cry or run . But instead he stayed perfectly still while she touched him . It was as if he had drifted out of his own body and was merely an onlooker . She climbed on top of him and guided his penis into a warm wetness . So warm , so wet , so good . And he knew he was going to come any second , and it was going to be better than it had ever been before with any of the paper Playboy girls , or with Tina and a wad of Kleenex . And ohhh , ahhh .... " You 'll never need anyone else but Mommy now , will you , Buddy ? Will you ? " she crooned softly , her voice full of gloating satisfaction . He left in the early hours of the morning while she still slept . Only this time he was smart . He cleared her purse of two hundred dollars and took several pieces of expensive jewelry . This time he was really going . And no way was he ever coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gum from his pocket and checked out a tall redhead walking into the building . An out-of-work actress , he could tell . They all had that same half-desperate look in their eyes as if they would do anything for a role . And most of them would . He rolled the gum over his tongue and walked slowly to the parking lot in back . Buddy had the perfect Hollywood stud walk , part Travolta in Saturday Night Fever , part Gere in American Gigolo . He knew he looked great . He should  --  he had worked hard to capture that lazy norny hip-swaying thrust . He could have played the hell out of the guy in Gigolo . He had lived the part , for chrissake . In the eleven years he had been on his own he had lived most parts . " Hey , Buddy . How ya doin ' , man ? " Quince , a black actor friend ofhis , slapped palms as they passed . " Frances in a good mood today ? " He shrugged . " She 's gettin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When did you get back , man ? " " A day or two ago . " " So stay around , we 'll share a cappucino . I got a wild new fox nibblin ' at my breakfast crunchies , one you have to meet , a real peach . And she has a sister . " " Some other time . I got ta see a guy about a series . " " Sure , so like later . Give me a buzz and we 'll get it together . Drop by Maverick 's one night . " " I 'd like that . " They slapped palms once again and went their separate ways . Buddy pulled up the collar on his leather jacket and headed for his car . Why had n't he told Quince . he was married ? Why did he wish he had n't told Frances ? He was n't regretting it , was he ? Hell , no . But a guy had to promote a certain image , and his image was that of a sexy macho stud ready to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehow a wife just did n't fit the picture . He started the old car and tuned to a rock station . Angel was hardlyita wife to be ashamed of . She was young , beautiful , and pure . Kind of a funny word , but how else could you describe a girl like Angel ? Most of the stuff running around Hollywood was into everything and everyone by the time they hit twenty . Angel was different . But how to keep her that way in a town crawling with creeps ? Right now that was n't the problem . The immediate problem was scoringsome bucks . Angel thought he was a winner , and no way was he going to let her think otherwise , even if it meant falling back into bad habits  --  only on a temporary basis , of course . He put his foot hard down on the accelerator and headed toward BeverlyHills . He took out the cottage cheese , got a spoon from the drawer , and sat down at the kitchen table . There was no denying it , he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  three people hacked to death for no apparent reason . And one of those people was pathetic little Joey Kravetz . The newspapers had described her as a " beautiful teenage model . " If a victim was under thirty and female she was automatically described as beautiful , it made better headlines . Model , my ass , he thought . And he should know . He felt anger and frustration every time he thought of Joey and her bloody mutilated body . Joey . She was only a kid . He remembered their first encounter. 6Millie Rosemont mumbled in her sleep and threw her left arm restlessly across her husband . Leon lay on his back and stared unseeingly at the ceiling . Carefully he moved his wife 's arm and turned to look at her , willing her to wake up so that they could talk . She did not budge . Silently he slid from the bed , padded into the kitchen , opened the refrigerator and stared mournfullyat the contents . Six eggs , a bowl of apples , some skim milk , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was supposed to be on a diet , and Millie was only helping him keep to it . Over a three-month period he had put on twenty-four pounds . A steady two pounds a week . He felt big and ungainly , not to mention the fact that the waist on his pants had had to be let out three times , and his jackets and shirts were bursting at the seams . It was Millie 's fault . She was a sensational cook . It was his fault . He ate like a pig , especially when he had something on his mind . " Lookin ' for games , mister ? " Leon could not believe he was being propositioned . He glanced around , convinced the baby faced hooker in the black fake-leather mini-dress and ridiculously high wedges was talking to someone else . The street was deserted . " How old are you ? " he asked incredulously . " Old enough ! " She winked cheekily , and he noticed a distinct cast to her left eye . She could n't be more than fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , cowboy ? " She placed her hands on her hips and grinned at him . " I can show ya paradise ! " " And I can show you my ID . I 'm a detective . " The grin faded . " A cop ? Aw sheet . " She cocked her head to one side . " You 're not gon na pull me in , are ya ? I mean , we was just talkin ' . I did n't offer you nothin ' . " " Where do you live ? " She was n't sure if he was accepting her original offer or planning to book her . " I got ta go , " she whined . " You live with your parents ? " " I ai n't got no parents , man . I 'm eighteen . I can do what I want . " " And I can take you to the station and book you for soliciting if I want . " She stared down the street and contemplated making a run for it . But he was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck her thumb in her mouth and chewed on it . " Tell ya what . I 'll give ya a freebie , " she said after a moment or two . He wondered if he should take her in . Not that rounding up underage hookers was his job . But Jesus ! He was a cop . You had to have some sense of responsibility , and she was only a child. 56 57 " I think you 'd better come with me , " he said wearily , and gripped her by the skinny arm . " Motherfucker ! " She kicked him hard on the shin , wrested her arm free , and ran . He rubbed his ankle , watched her clatter wildly down the street , then limped to his car and sat thoughtfully behind the wheel . He would give the information to Juvenile ; they 'd pick her up in no time . Angrily Leon spooned bland cottage cheese into his mouth . Joey . What a terrible waste . In his mind he reviewed the case on the vanished Deke Andrews . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deke Andrews was remembered as smart , dumb , rude , polite , aggressive , a troublemaker , a loner . The list went on and on , and no two people agreed . Fact : He was a car nut . Fact : He had shoulder-length hair . Big deal  --  he probably had cut that off the moment he ran . Fact : He was sallow complexioned , six feet two inches tall , thin but strong . Fact : He was not successful with women . Of the four girls tracked down whom he had dated , not one would admit to sleeping with him . Indeed , not one had even ventured on a second outing . " Why ? " Leon had questioned . " Du n no . " Girlish shrugs . " He was just sort of . . . weird . " They all had variations on the same theme . So add weird to his list of outstanding qualities . A young , apparently healthy male , and they could not find one girl he had screwed . Logical conclusion  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be where Joey came in . But why had he taken her home with him ? And why had he indulged in such a passionateorgy of killing ? As the days turned into weeks and the weeks into months , Leon tried to get a picture in his mind of Deke . But there were so many contradictions it was impossible . Only the facts were clear . The Andrews family had moved into the house on Friendship Street over twenty years before . Their background was a mystery , they seemed to have sprung from nowhere . Deke went to junior high , graduated from high school , took a job in a garage , and stayed there until the murders . Then he vanished , taking nothing but a carryall and the secret of what had precipitated his acts of violence. 58Inevitably new cases came along and the Friendship Street murders became less important . The press stopped mentioning them , because all at once they were old news . At police headquarters the file was still open , but it was no longer hot . Other cases came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one fade away and become just another dusty file . Most of all he was not prepared to forget about Joey . Millie walked into the kitchen , her face swollen with sleep . She swooped on the dish of cottage cheese as though it were contraband . " And what do you think you 're doin ' , Leon Rosemont ? " she demanded sternly . Millie slept naked . For her trip to the kitchen she had not bothered to put clothes on her lovely black body . Leon felt his first arousal in weeks . He grinned and rose from the table . Her eyes were immediately drawn to his erection . " My , oh , my ! " she drawled . " So that 's what I got ta do to get you sexy . Just take me some cottage cheese to bed ! " He laughed with her , followed her into the bedroom , and was not embarrassed by the roll of fat around his middle as they began to make love . With Millie everything was natural . She was the warmest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time he had set eyes on her . She had been a schoolteacher then , and she had brought a group of youngsters to the precinct for an outing . Some outing . Hookers screaming obscenities . A pickpocket or two getting booked . A few gang members with their heads busted open . And pimps and pushers and undercover cops and muggers and car thieves and junkies and rape victims . Just a normal day on the job . She was dark of skin and soft of voice . Her eyes were brown and kindly , her lips wide and sensual . He was fifty years old and he had been divorced from his first wife , Helen , for years , so there was no reason why he should n't find out her number and call her . A month later they were married . And for three years they had been very happy indeed . Millie sighed and rolled over . " That was real g0000d ! " " It was real fast too , " he apologized . " Not my fault ! " True . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem disappointed ; in no time at all her breathing was deep and even and she was asleep . Leon lay there wide awake , his mind back on Deke Andrews . He was out there somewhere . Somewhere in the black night . Somewhere .. . And he , Leon Rosemont , would have to find him . For Joey 's sake. 59 " St . . . eee . . . tch . That 's it , ladies . Put something into it . One more time . Come on now  --  str . . . eee . . . tch . " Elaine thought she might have done herself permanent damage . She lay on her stomach in a large workout studio with thirty other women , most of them in impeccable shape . Her right arm was behind her clutching desperately to the ankle of her left leg . Every muscle in her body was on full alert . It felt terrible . " Okay , everyone . Let it go . Relax , " the instructor said . As Elaine slumped flat on her face she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . She stared up at him from her prone position . He wore a yellow leotard , black leg warmers , and a striped scarf . His crotch bulged disconcertingly . " Is he gay ? " she whispered to Karen Lancaster , who lay beside her . " I expect so , " Karen answered . " All the pretty ones are nowadays . " " Okay , " said the instructor . " I want you to join me in a little something called the Snake . " " The one-eyed variety , I hope , " murmured Karen wistfully . Disco music blared as thirty almost perfect bodies writhed across the floor on their stomachs . Elaine joined in and inexplicably began to feel incredibly horny . All that pressure on the clit . And no action from Ross in God knew how long , although he was due back from location that very afternoon , and maybe , if she was very very lucky .. . I want to come , she thought , right here and now . She gazed at impossiblecrotch and shuddered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the slight smell of sweat filtered in among the heavy scent of Joy and Estee and Opium . " Oh God ! " she exclaimed . " Sorry ? " questioned Karen . " Nothing , " she giggled , feeling very liberated . " Okay , ladies . That 's it for today . Did you enjoy it ? " He had to be kidding . She would come every day . The double entendre almost made her laugh aloud , and feeling pleased with herself , she got up and headed for the showers . Ron Gordino 's health and exercise class . The latest and the best . Bibi Sutton had discovered it . Where Bibi went others followed . Elaine stripped in a tiny cubicle , then , naked , stepped boldly into the communal shower . Very un  --  Beverly Hills . But right now very in . Anyonewho was frightened to show everything she had at Ron Gordino 's was immediately suspect . Nudity and letting it all hang out were the thing to do . Perfumed soap oozed from a wall faucet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes darting this way and that checking out the other bodies on display . Karen had the largest nipples she had ever seen . Big brown buttons , like giant knobs on a transistor radio . Elaine decided that if she were a man she would probably find them quite repulsive . " Have you heard about the new Neil Gray film ? " Karen asked . She was tall , with a supple tanned body , thick copper-colored hair , and carefullychiseled features . Her connections were the best ; she knew everyone and everything , since her father was George Lancaster , a giant superstar who had retired five years previously to marry Pamela London , the thirdrichestwoman in America . He now lived in Palm Beach , and Karen visited him often . She was in her early thirties and twice divorced . " No . What 's he doing ? " Elaine soaped under her arms and tried to stop staring at her friend 's awful nipples . " A movie that his wife wrote . Can you imagine ? " For a moment Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not his ex-wife , silly . His wife . Montana . El big pain in the necko . " " Oh . Her . " Elaine was silent for a moment while she digested this information . She always thought of Maralee as Neil Gray 's wife , although they had been divorced for years . Elaine had never met Montana , although of course she had heard enough about her . " Neil sent the script to Daddy in the hope that he would want to do it , " Karen continued . " He told me it 's very good . Of course , nobody believes that Montana actually wrote it . Neil must have written it himself and decided to give her credit . " " Is George interested ? " Elaine asked curiously , wondering what Karen was leading up to. 76061 " No way would Daddy do a movie  --  not even if it was guaranteed to be another Gone with the Wind . He 's had the picture biz . Being married to Pamela London suits him fine . I mean , they own Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapping themselves in giant fluffy bath sheets . " The thing is , " Karen continued pointedly , " that Daddy says the part is perfect for Ross  --  you know he 's always liked him . " That was news to Elaine . Ross only had bad things to say about George Lancaster , calling him everything from a ham actor to a hood . They had n't even received an invitation to the Palm Beach wedding , one of the social events of the year . Karen had explained apologetically at the time , " Ca n't invite too much show biz . Pamela 's orders . " So how come everyone from Lucille Ball to Gregory Peck had been present ? Elaine had burned with fury for weeks . " Who is Ross 's agent ? " Karen inquired artlessly . Elaine stared at her friend and wondered why this sudden interest in her husband 's career . " He 's with Zack Schaeffer . " Karen frowned . " I ca n't understand why he is n't with Sadie La Salle . She really is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every time , she brought the subject up , Ross muttered something about Sadie and him not getting along . At parties they studiously ignored each other , and he vetoed Elaine 's suggestion of ever inviting the powerful Ms. La Salle to their home . It was a well-known fact that Sadie had discovered Ross years and years ago  --  but apparently that meant nothing to either of them . It really infuriatedElaine , because Sadie La Salle was , as Karen said , the absolute best . " I hear they 're talking Tony Curtis or Kirk Douglas now , " Karen continued . " Why do n't you get Zack on it right away ? I think it 's called Street People . Oliver Easterne 's producing . You know Oliver , do n't you ? " Yes , she knew Oliver . He was What Makes Sammy Run ? reincarnated , a hotshot hustler who got lucky . Ross could n't stand him either . And anyway , if George Lancaster thought Ross was so perfect , why had n't he suggested him ? " Ross has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And if they 're talking Curtis and Douglas they 're hardly talking big-time . " Karen laughed softly . " Come on , Elaine . Do n't snow job me . I know where every single body is buried in this town . Ross needs a good film , and this could be it . " e  --  s62 " Ninety-two . . . ninety-three . . . ninety-four . " The words shot out of Buddy 's mouth as his arms propelled his body up and down . Push-ups . One hundred a day . Kept him in the greatest shape in town . " Ninetyeight. . . ninety-nine . . . one hundred . " He leaped up energetically , barely out of breath . Angel clapped her hands in admiration . She watched him every morning . " Buddy , I love you ! " she sang out . " I totally love you ! " " Hey  --  hey . " He grinned . " What 's with the outburst ? " " I just feel so happy ! " She ran to him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to be cuddled more than anything else in the world . With Buddy it always turned into something more , but she did n't mind that either . This time he pushed her gently away . " Gon na take a fast swim , then I 've got me that important interview . Remember ? I told you yesterday . " She did n't remember . But maybe that was because he was always busy running here , there , and everywhere . They had been in Hollywood for two weeks and during the day she hardly ever saw him . " Business , " he had explained . " Y'know , kid , I been away . It 'll take a few weeks before everything falls into position . " She hoped it would fall into position soon , because she could n't wait to accompany Buddy to the studio . She could just see the movie magazines : Mrs. Buddy Hudson visited her husband on the set of his latest movie today . What a cute couple ! Angel Hudson , an aspiring actress , says that Buddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a four-page color-photo spread of them together . Jogging in matching track suits . Feeding each other ice cream . Laughing in a hot ' tub . " Buddy ? " She ran after him as he headed for the door . " Do you think you 'll be doing a movie soon ? " He stared at her upturned face , wide eyes , and adoring expression . Maybe he had convinced her a little too thoroughly that he was hot shit in the movie world . But then he had n't expected her to believe him so absolutely . " I sure hope so , babe . Like I told you , I have been away , an ' this town 's got a real short memory . " " Oh . " Disappointment clouded her face . " But you can bet on old Buddy Boy pullin ' off somethin ' real big an ' juicy soon . Like I just turned down a guest shot on Cheers . The part was n't big enough . I got ta come back with somethin ' special . Right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glowing again . He contemplated postponing his swim . Making love to Angel was like taking a ride to heaven. 63But then he thought , No , got ta get my act together , got ta get my muscles in shape , got ta swim off some of the anger and frustration that 's beginning to creep into every pore of my body . i Back in town two stinking weeks , and nothing . No action whichever way he turned . Commercials . Movies . Television . Zilch . Six interviews . Six turndowns . He was Buddy Hudson . He had everything going for him . Why were n't they hanging out flags ? He ran down two flights of stairs to what was laughingly referred to as the " pool area . " There were twenty-two apartments , each of which housed at least two people . Every day forty-four bodies splashed and reveled in the slimy twenty-foot pool , which never seemed to get cleaned . The only good thing about the small apartment was that it cost nothing , courtesy of Buddy 's good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a wealthy widow and her daughter . May the relationship last forever  --  that was Buddy 's daily mantra . It was early , so the pool was deserted . A thin film of oil formed a slick on top of the water . He dived straight in  --  if you stopped to think about it you were lost . Then he churned up and down like a frantic dolphin confined in too small a space . When he hit it , man , he would get the biggest and the best pool in the whole city . Something with space , and cool clear water , and a diving board , and Italian tile , and a filter that worked . " ' Morning . " A girl stood by the side watching him . She had orange hair frizzed into tight little curls on top of her head , and she wore the smallest string bikini he had ever seen . It barely covered her large breasts , and merely skimmed her crotch . He continued to swim . She settled herself on a towel and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit on her . Immediately . He always had the best lookers , and this one , while being nowhere near Angel , was , in her own particular way , a very choice number . " My name 's Shelly , " she announced . " Who 're you ? " He hauled himself from the pool and began doing leg bends . " Buddy . Buddy Hudson . " " You live here alone ? " she asked pointedly , unhooking the clasp on her bikini top and taking it off . He could n't help staring at her large firm breasts . " No . I live here with my wife . " She hooted with laughter . " You 're married ? " 64 What was so funny about that ? " Yeah . I 'm married . " Furiously he worked on his legs  --  four more pulls on each thigh and then straight back into the pool for further punishment . He did the crawl for thirty lengths before emerging again . Shelly lay on her back , legs spread and nicely oiled , boobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , and a transistor radio was tuned to KITS FM . Buddy picked up his towel and walked into the building . On his way upstairs he checked out the mailbox . Three bills for Randy . A leaflet urging all and sundry to JOIN JESUS . And a brochure from an enthusiastic exterminator : YOU GOT MICE WE DEAL WITH ' EM NICE . In the one-room apartment Angel was busying herself with a vacuum . She switched off the machine when he entered and grinned . " I borrowed it from the lady next door . She said I could use it anytime . Is n't that nice ? " " Sure is . " Angel was a nut . Why waste time vacuuming this dump ? He pulled off his wet shorts and dropped them on the floor before walking to the closet they called a bathroom . There he attempted to shower with a hand attachment that fitted onto the bathtaps  --  not an easy exercise . When he emerged Angel was busy squeezing fresh juice for him behind the bar , which doubled as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all , would neatly fit into two medium-sized suitcases . He opened the closet and selected black slacks , his one and only silk shirt , and a lightweight Yves Saint Laurent jacket . Fortunately , in Buddy'scase , clothes did not make the man . Whatever he put on looked good , and he knew it . This puzzled him . If he always looked so good , how come he was n't a star ? He dressed and gulped the juice Angel handed him . " I 'll be back around six or seven . What are you goin ' to do today ? " " Go to the market , I guess . Only I 'll need some money . " " Oh yeah , sure . " He was embarrassed . He had no money . He was down to his last hundred . Dragging some bills from his pocket , he gave her two tens . " Do n't spend it all at once . " Corny old cliche . Sometimes he hated himself . She smiled . " I 'll try not to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gorgeous body , kissed her on the mouth . " Later , sugar . " Pre-production was in full swing . Since Street People was to be shot mainly on location , there was much to get organized . The availability of the crew Neil usually worked with was of prime importance , and so fareverything was falling into position  --  no big problems . He was out early most days with his lighting cameraman and first assistant scouting for locations . Some directors employed location scouts , but he preferred to do it himself . Montana was busy casting . She had settled into an office in Oliver Easterne 's building on the Strip and gone straight to work . She could have gotten an agency to sift through the hundreds of possibles , or indeed hired a first-rate casting director like Frances Cavendish , but she wanted to see everyone herself , then present her selections to Neil for his full approval . It was her movie , and she planned to see it stayed that way . The excitement of actually launching into the pre-production period was heady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Neil , and he loved her script and wanted to do it . But even if he had hated it . . . well , she was confident it was good enough to take to any studio or independent and get people interested . It was the best work she had ever done , and she had no intention of succumbing to false modesty . Street People was good because it was real . She had based it on scenes of life that were happening all around . Mostly she had based it on the characters she had observed while shooting her children 's film on the streets of Los Angeles . Neil 's enthusiasm was a real plus , but deep down she could n't help thinking that if he had n't grabbed the property , maybe  --  just maybe  --  she might have gotten the chance to direct it herself . Bullshit . Since when did women get opportunities like that ? Wise up , kid , and be grateful your old man 's doing it so at least you get a fifty percent say . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of them were only one line , but they mattered . Montana did n't want to see actors who were in every dreary television show , she wanted new talent  --  and she was enjoying every minute of finding the perfect actor or actress for each role . They came in their hundreds . Smiling , surly , eager . Old , young , pretty , ugly . All carried their portfolios filled with photos , lists of credits and resumes . Agents assaulted her from all sides . The good and the bad . " You wan na Marilyn Monroe type ? I got ta girl that 'll rouse every cock from here to the Valley ! " " This boy I 'm sending you is James Dean . I 'm telling you he 's Dean  --  only better . " " A young Brando . " " An older Brooke Shields . " " A sexy Julie Andrews . " 66 " A taller Dudley Moore . " " An American Michael Caine . " She was swamped with every type possible . But gradually she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find . In the evenings she worked on the script  --  adding scenes , changinglines . Neil told her about the locations he had found , and she told him fi about some of the characters she had interviewed . Their personal life got swept to one side while together they lived , breathed , and ate Street People . It became the focus of both their lives . Occasionally they fought . The three main roles were not cast . Oliver Easterne wanted at least two bankable stars , and Neil was hotly pursuing retired superstar George Lancaster . " If we get George , " he pointed out , " the other two can be unknowns . " " If we get the asshole , " Oliver agreed . To him all actors were assholes , be they stars or bit players . " Which does n't seem likely , the way things are going . " " I 'll fly to Palm Beach this weekend , " Neil decided . " He likes thescript . I think I can convince him . " ill " I hope so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Neil knew about Oliver 's ideas . Half-assed star names that were wrongwrong wrong . He had no intention of even considering them . Montana was not mad with enthusiasm about George Lancaster . " Heca n't act , " she stated flatly . " He will . With me . " She was unconvinced , but realistic enough to know that certain concessionshad to be made . " What do you think ? Should I come with you ? " Neil shook his head quickly . " No . You 've got enough to take care of here . I can handle George . " She nodded . " There 's a couple of actors I think we should test for the part of Vinnie . " " If we land George Lancaster . Otherwise we go with a name . " " I do n't know why . " " Yes you do . It 's called playing the box-office game . " " I never did like playing games . " " Learn . " " Screw you , " she murmured amiably . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She grinned . " I 'll make time , when you get back . " Elaine 's day . After Ron Gordino 's exercise class , a visit to the Nail Kiss of Life , 67then four hours at Elizabeth Arden having her legs waxed , her eyebrows shaped , a facial , and her hair washed and blow-dried . She got home in time to change into green Norell lounging pajamas before Ross arrived back from location . Even if she did say so herself , she looked wonderful . " You look divine ! " she whispered to her bedroom mirror . Eat your heart out , Etta the Elephant . She strolled into the living room and was about to fix herself a drink when glancing through the huge plate-glass windows she was horrified to see him at it again . Pissing in her pool ! " Lina ! " she yelled , striding to the glass doors and stepping outside . " Lina ! " The boy lazily zipped up without  --  it seemed  --  a care in the world . " Afternoon , ma'am , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shouted . " I saw what you did ! " He was now bending over the hose , which gushed fresh water into the pool . " Huh ? " " Do n't huh me . You know what I mean . " Lina appeared at that point , wiping her hands on an apron tied firmly around her waist and frowning . " What ees it , senora ? I try make dinner . " Elaine pointed a perfectly manicured finger at the boy . " I do not want him here again . You understand me , Lina ? Not anymore . " He continued to fiddle with the hose while Lina heaved a dramatic sigh . " Miguel  --  he sick  --  " she began . " I do n't care about Miguel , " Elaine screamed . " I do n't care if he drops dead on the job . But I do not  --  and please understand me  --  I do not want this ... this ... person here ever again . You got that , Lina ? " Lina gave another big dramatic sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I got . " " Good . Then get him out of here right now . " Elaine stalked back into the house and headed straight for the bar , where she fixed herself a double shot of vodka with one token ice cube . Unbelievable ! Help these days ! Impossible ! An old pickup truck flashed past from the back of the house just as a long black limousine pulled up at the front . Ross ! Quickly Elaine checked out her appearance in the antiqued mirror behind the bar . She looked good . Would n't it be nice if he noticed for once ? He did n't . He strode into the house , wearing mud-caked boots over faded Levi 's , and a checked shirt with an old leather jacket . Lately Ross had taken to dressing young . It did n't suit him . He looked like an overthe-hillcowboy . " Darling ! " Dutifully she pecked at his cheek , and was rewarded with rough stubble . " Hot damn ! " he exclaimed . " Am I glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on a white brocade sofa which Elaine had just had recovered at great expense and put his legs up , boots and all . " I 'm friggin ' exhausted ! Get me a drinkfore I fuckin ' faint ! " The movie star was home . Buddy whistled as he ran down the stairs from the apartment . Angel with the trusting eyes . She never bugged him , complained about the apartment or their lack of money . She never questioned him when he came home , or insisted that he tell her what he was doing every minute of the day . She was perfect . Golden lady . One day he would swamp her with furs and jewels and stereos and cars . Whatever she wanted  --  it would be hers . When ? That was the question . When would it all happen for him ? He had been in Hollywood ten years now . Ten years was a long time  --  a real long time . Running away from his mother the second time was easy , especially with two hundred dollars to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a fox , and determined not to be caught , he got out of San Diego as quickly as he could , jumping a bus to Los Angeles , then hitching his way down to the beach , where he hung out sleeping rough , scrounging food , and making friends . There were a lot of kids in the same position . Runawayswith nothing to do with their time except the five big Ss  --  Surf , Swim , Sunbathe , Sleep , and Sex . With a few drugs thrown in whenever they could afford it . Buddy did n't hesitate , he got into sex in a big way . There was no lack of partners among the girls . The boys , too , but that was definitely not his scene , His first score was a big freckled girl who liked it rough . She loved to roll on the beach with sand penetrating every crack . He had her two or three times a day until she ran off with a fat man in a Cadillac who promised her Acapulco . Next came a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she called it . He did n't like that , it made him feel too vulnerable , as if her sharp white teeth were going to clamp down and ruin his future . He moved on to a Swedish starlet who visited muscle beach to develop her pectorals . She taught him to drive her pale pink Thunderbird , and to give head . He enjoyed both . He got himself a job slinging hamburgers at a beach hangout , and that gave him just enough money to rent a room . A friend showed him how to play the guitar , and he was n't bad . He worked on his voice , getting together a repertoire of songs . Occasionally he landed himself a gig singing and strumming the guitar , which was a help financially . The five big Ss remained constant . He was tanned all over , strong from surfing , muscled from working out . He had all the sex he ever wanted , plenty of sleep , and he never once thought of his mother . She was dead as far as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the way he wanted it . He palled up with a would-be actor named Randy Felix , and once in a while he 'd hitch a ride into Hollywood and hang around the class Randy attended , Joy Byron 's Method Acting School . Joy Byron was an old English broad with a voice like a hacksaw . She wore flowered dresses and carried a parasol at all times , even indoors . Her students adored her , and worshiped regularly twice a week in a disused warehouse on the wrong side of Wilshire . When Randy dropped out to pursue other interests , Buddy continued to go on his own . He loved every minute of the two-hour classes , and soon he was performing everything from Stanley Kowalski in A Streetcar Named Desire to Jay Gatsby in The Great Gatsby . Joy Byron said he was good , and she should know . In her day she had acted with the very best  --  Olivier , Gielgud , all the English greats , or so she said  --  and Buddy was inclined to believe her . As acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A move seemed logical , and Randy , who was sharing a house with two girls in West Hollywood , said there was always room for a fourth . Just before he hit twenty , Buddy moved in . The house was a dump , the girls were dykes , but living in Hollywood was living in Hollywood . Buddy felt at home in no time at all . Only problems : no money , no car . Getting by at the beach was one thing . Making out in town was another . Randy always seemed to be reasonably flush , so Buddy asked him how he did it . " By gettin ' paid for what you 're givin ' away for free , " Randy explained . " I got me an agent takes twenty percent an ' arranges everythin ' . No hassle . No sweat . I sell dick  --  to ladies . It sure as hell beats shovelin ' hot dogs ! " " You sell what ? " " Give it a try , Buddy . I get a commission on every stud I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Really ? " Buddy asked between bouts of mirth . " Really ? " Randy nodded . He was five feet nine inches tall , pleasant-looking but nothing special . He had a large nose , small eyes , and no back teeth . When he laughed this was very noticeable . " I 'll be a son of a bitch ! " Buddy exclaimed . Randy took him to meet his agent , a black homosexual dressed from head to toe in tight white leather. 70 " No ... er ... male customers , " Buddy mumbled , hardly believing what he was getting himself into . " No males ? " sniffed the agent , affectionately known as Gladrags by his stable of active young studs . " What are you , some kind of a weirdo ? " So began his life as a hustler . The first time he was n't sure he could get it up . He met the woman at an apartment Gladrags had arranged . She turned up twenty minutes late , a middle-aged lady in a severely cut business suit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implying she was familiar with every one of Gladrags ' boys . " I do n't take my clothes off , " she announced , hitching her skirt around her waist and removing sensible white panties . " But I want you naked . Strip . " She lay down on the bed and watched him as he fumbled his way out of his clothes . Jeez ! He felt as if he were en route to the dentist ! No way could he get a hard-on until desperately he remembered Randy 's advice  --  " Close your eyes and use your imagination . " Quickly he flashed onto a memory of a girl he had balled recently . Nineteen . Pretty . With a trick of licking his balls until he felt he could shoot his stuff twenty feet in the air . It worked . Suddenly he was in business . He never looked back . Servicing women for money was no problem . It paid the bills and enabled him to pursue an acting career . Joy Byron fixed him up with an agent , and he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately he landed a two-liner in a Starsky and Hutch , followed by a small part in a Burt Reynolds blockbuster . He was on his way ! He was going to be a star ! It did n't exactly work out that way . There followed a lean patch  --  the Starsky and Hutch episode aired and he was not in it , and the Burt Reynolds movie played and he was not in that either . The . humiliation of ending up on the cutting-room floor twice was too much . " Never mind , " Joy Byron consoled . " Something else will come along . " She was a funny old bird who had taken to inviting him to her house for " extra coaching . " He was flattered , and he certainly enjoyed acting out scenes from all the great plays with her , although sometimes , in the dusty living room of her Hollywood Hills house , when they were in the middle of a scene , she would move a little too close for comfort . He was servicing women for money regularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Byron was not be be relished . For a start she had to be at least seventy years old . And he respected her . She was a great actress . She was his teacher , for crissakes . One night she said to him , " Buddy , I have a wonderful idea . The71 workshop will put on a special performance of Streetcar . I will invite agents , casting directors , studio executives . I know these people , and if I invite them they will come . You , of course , will play Stanley Kowalski . A perfect showcase for you . " " Hey ... terrific , " he began . She grabbed him before he could finish the sentence . It was n't that bad . It was n't that good . He got to give up whoring . He moved into Joy 's freaky house and she took care of all the bills . He got to act day and night , night and day . Joy was always ready . He zipped through all the great playwrights . He zoomed through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue in the face . Joy Byron taught him plenty about the business . Everything from makeup to lighting and the best camera angles . She coached him in mime , and diction , and posture . She kept him very busy , and true to her word she starred him in a student production of Streetcar . Several important people actually did turn up , including Frances Cav- endish . The flinty-eyed casting agent was one of the best in town because she never missed an opportunity to view new talent . Buddy looked sensational . Torn T-shirt . Skin-tight jeans . Marlon Brando move over . He had seen the 1951 movie many times on television . He had studied every nuance and gesture of the great actor 's performance . Now he had it down perfectly , and he knew he was good . It did not surprise him when Frances Cavendish sent back a note for him to drop by and see her . He waited a week . Did not want to appear too anxious . Then he sauntered into her office , perched on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear ya wan na make me a movie star . " She adjusted her glasses and stared at him . " Shift your buns off my desk , sonny . They 're casting a horror movie at Universal . I think you might be right . Get yourself over there pronto . " He got the part . Three days . No lines . There followed a series of similar bits . A week on a gangster movie . Two days on Police Woman . A shaving-cream commercial . A two-part Vegas , his best role yet . Fi- rally  --  his shot . " I think you 're right for the lead in a new pilot , " Frances said , and actually smiled . " This might be it , Buddy . " He was floating . The producers liked him . He ran home to Joy with a script and a stomach that would n't lie down . He was going to play the lead in a new pilot . He was going to be a star . 72 Joy Byron read the script and pronounced it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old lady . " We 'll shape it into something worthwhile , " she told him with a theatrical sigh . They worked long and hard . Joy gave him motivations , she told him exactly what to do and when to do it . She even accompanied him to the set to make sure he changed none of her instructions . On the second day , directly after the producers had viewed the previous day 's shooting , he was fired . " So what ? " snorted Joy Byron . " I told you it was crapshit ! " He left her house in the middle of the night while she slept . He was sick with disappointment and anger and frustration . When was Buddy Boy going to become a star ? He drifted right back into his old way of living . Only now he began to drink too much , and do too many drugs . A girlfriend introduced him to Maxie Sholto , an unsavory agent who was into arranging Hollywood parties  --  the kind where the hired help performed for an audience . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was with two bimbos crawling all over him ? He was on show . And the women at the parties loved him . One day he bumped into his friend Randy . " You 're gon na be dog turd in this town if you do n't watch it , " Randy warned . Buddy was flying . " I 'm makin ' big bucks . Y ' want some of my action ? " " Where 's your big bucks gettin ' you ? All I see is snow up your nose an ' grass down your throat . Straighten out , or you 'll be finished . " He straightened out . Three nights later . In the middle of an orgy with come streaming down his face from a fat record producer , and a thin girl riding pony on his joint , he caught his reflection in a mirror , and he also caught a camera in action , which pissed him no end . He threw the girl off him , smashed the camera , beat up the record producer , and stormed out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a star , and nothing would stop him . The next day he hopped a plane to Hawaii , where he dried out , got himself a job singing in a piano bar , and met Angel . So , Buddy thought to himself , as he climbed in his wreck of a car . What to do now ? Returning to L.A. with new bride in tow all ready to set the town on fire was one thing . Reality was another . He needed money , and there was only one sure way he knew how to get it . Neil Gray glanced around the VIP lounge . He nursed a large Jack Daniel 's on the rocks , his second . Across the room sat Gina Germaine . Blond , bubbly , bosoms and bum. 738She was surrounded by admiring airline personnel tripping over each other to grant her every wish . He had greeted her briefly when she entered . Two people who knew each other only vaguely . Christ ! But his balls were aching for her . He could n't wait to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in the toilet if she would let him . If she would let him indeed ! Gina Gennaine would let him fuck her in Trader Vic 's on a Sunday night if he told her that 's what he wanted . God ! Was he getting senile ? Why this obsession with some blond movie star ? There was definitely something the matter with him . Had to be . Taking her to Palm Beach with him was sheer lunacy . The risk of getting found out ... The risk was giving him the best erection he 'd had all year . New York could turn you schizo . If you were n't already . What mean streets . Dirt and grime and low-down filthy reality . Rats . Cockroaches . The streets were crawling with them  --  the human kind too . A stroll through the city could guarantee no end of meetings with the insane . Deke kept himself to himself . He walked with a purposeful stride , his chin tucked down , his bleak eyes hooded and watchful . Once two kids tried to jump him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not yet dark , and people were plentiful on the street . No one came to his aid as he struggled with the two crazed teenagers , one armed with a knife . Deke fought back . He thrust and lunged and clawed , until he was able to grab the knife from his assailant and shove it into the boy 's chest , surprise spilling out of the boy 's stoned eyes as blood spilled out of his body. 74The other attacker ran , and Deke strolled casually off while passersby scurried along the street , eyes studiously averted . It gave him such a good feeling  --  a tremendous surge of power . It reminded him of Philadelphia . That night  --  that special night . His step quickened as he remembered ... . The machete he had bought from a pawnshop for twenty bucks because he liked the look of it . It had hung on the wall of his bedroom unused for two years , although occasionally he had taken it down and struck a pose in front of his dresser mirror . He had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for real . He thought of Joey . Of her squat body , spiky hair , and wide red mouth . Joey Kravetz . " Hey  --  hey . You lookin ' for some fun , buster ? " Deke attempted to walk past , but she blocked his way , planting herself firmly in his path . She cocked her head on one side and winked lasciviously . " I do n't wan na rip ya off , nothin ' like that . I just wan na get in your pants an ' give ya the hottest bounce y'had all year . Can y'dig it ? " He stared at her . She was almost pretty , but her nose was off center , one eye had a slight cast , her lipstick was smudged over a red cavern of a mouth . " How much ? " he muttered . " A buck a minute . Ca n't be fairer than that . " She squinted up at him , for he was much taller than her five feet two inches . " Ya wo n't regret a dime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been called that before . It made him feel good . " Okay , " he mumbled , knowing the event would take no longer than five minutes . " Where ? " " I got me a little jive-ass palace . " She grabbed him by the arm . " Two blocks down , ya can tell me the story of y'life on the way . My name 's Joey , what 's yours ? " He had never met a girl like her before . Sure , he 'd had plenty of hookers with sour mouths and empty eyes ; and girls he had dated , who smiled politely and never let him so much as touch them . Joey was different . She seemed to want to be with him as they walked along the rain-soaked street . Her " palace " was a small room two flights up with a sink in the corner , a bed lounged on by a fat white cat , and one lamp draped with a singed pink chiffon scarf . She shooed the cat off the bed , threw off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huh ? Sure beats my last dump . " He stood hesitantly in the doorway and wondered if it would be asusual . Money out first , then a furtive hump against a silent piece of meat . Joey undid the side zip on her tight black mini-skirt and wriggled out of it . Underneath she wore bikini panties with " Tuesday " embroidered in red . It was Friday , Deke groped in his pocket for some money . " Put it away , y'do n't know how long ya gon na stay , " she giggled . " Sure y'do n't wan na change the deal ? Fifty bucks for as long as ya like ? " He shook his head . " Suit yourself , buster , " she said , pulling her sweater over orange spiky hair and flinging it on the floor . She had very small breasts with cheaply rouged nipples . The color had smudged ; so had the mascara under her lazy eye . She brought her fingers up and played with her nipples until they stood at attention . " Now ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she giggled . " I got lotsa tricks like that , cowboy . " He coughed dryly . " You 're really nice , " she said , continuing to play with her rouged nipples . " I like you . I think you an ' me could be friends  --  y ' know  --  real close friends . You 've got the kinda eyes I like , horny eyes . I could get off just lookin ' into your eyes , cowboy  --  just lookin ' . " He stayed two hours . It cost him one hundred and twenty dollars and was worth every cent . In the distance Deke could hear the familiar whine of police sirens . He quickened his pace . It was definitely time to move on . New York had been a good resting place , a city to get lost in while the murders faded away . Another day or so and he would be off . He had things to do , places to go. 769So , the big movie star was home . Bitching and complaining about everything . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes firmly glued to the television , when Elaine decided the time was right to mention the movie Karen Lancaster had told her about . " I think you should get Zack on it right away . " " Ha ! The great George Lancaster turns something down and you think I should call my agent , " sneered Ross . " Jesus , Elaine ! You really get to me sometimes . " " If the part was offered to George it has to be good , " she insisted stubbornly . " Bullshit ! George made more crap than a laxative factory . " Irritably he changed channels with the remote control . " George frigging Lancaster is fifteen frigging years older than me . Do n't you forget that . " " Twelve , " corrected Elaine . She knew everyone 's age to the exact day . Ross raised his ass from the bed and let forth a rampant fart . Elaine was enraged . Oh , if his fans could only see him now ! " If you have to do that , kindly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply he farted again and switched channels . " How come , before we were married , you always managed to control your bodily functions ? " she asked coldly . He mimicked her voice , " How come , before we were married , you never nagged ? " " God ! You 're impossible ! " She got out of their king-sized bed and pulled on a turquoise silk negligee . " Where are you going ? " he demanded . " To the kitchen . " 77 " Get me some ice cream . Vanilla and chocolate , with hot fudge sauce . " " You 're supposed to be on a diet . " " I do n't need a diet " " Everyone over the age of twenty-five needs a diet . " He weakened . " Get me the ice cream and I 'll call Zack . " " Promise ? " He grinned the famous Conti grin . " When have I ever lied to you , sweetheart ? " Montana sat in her office and stared at the young actor sitting across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . She lowered her eyes and studied the list of credits he had handed her . The usual rota of crap television and bad movies . I never expected to walk into this office today and find someone like you behind that desk , " he said in a low husky voice . He was hitting on her with his eyes again . A penetrating stare which she found most disconcerting , because in those eyes she could read stark desperation , and she understood the look only too well . " It says here that you 're twenty-two . I 'm really looking for someone a little older , " she said briskly . " How much older ? " he countered . She hesitated . Let him down easy . Rejection was never easy to dish out . " Well . . . er. ... twenty-five , - six . " " I can look older . I 'm really twenty-four . " He had a facial twitch , which sprang into action , spoiling his bland good looks . " Fine , " she said , handing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind . Thanks for coming by . " " Is that all ? " He sounded surprised . " Do n't you want me to read or anything ? " " Not today . " " Does that mean I 'll be coming back ? " She smiled in what she hoped was a noncommittal way . " Thank you , Mr. Crunch . " Crunch . What kind of a name was that ? " We 'll be in touch with your agent . " He stood up and sauntered toward her . " Can I see you sometime ? " he asked , the desperate eyes and the twitch going full-force . She felt sorry for him and all the hundreds of other young actors just like him . " Look , " she said patiently , " do n't sell yourself short . " " Huh ? " uh1 " You 're probably a very good actor , but not right for this movie  --  so stop pushing it . " He reddened , bit down hard on his bottom lip , but still kept trying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . Give me a try ? " he leered suggestively . " I come highly recommended , y'know what I mean ? " She was getting annoyed . " Why do n't you just go . Okay ? " " Lady , you have no idea what you 're missing , " he muttered . Her patience snapped . " Hey  --  I 've got a feeling I know exactly what I 'm missing . " Reluctantly he slouched from the room . She sighed . Hollywood . City of ambition . A town where success was the name of the game . If you had it you were top of the heap . If you did n't  --  goodbye Charlie , you were less than nothing . Hollywood . To be an actor or an actress you really had to be a masochist . That was for sure . Come to think of it , being a writer was no picnic either . She recalled her first efforts with the original outline on her television series . Nobody had taken her seriously at first . She had made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? What are your credits ? Baby , you got three strikes against you . One  --  you 're from the East Coast . Two  --  you 're a woman . Three  --  you 're a woman . Oh , really ? Wan na climb in the sack and discuss it ? She had never used Neil 's influence to achieve anything . The television idea was good . Eventually it had sold . Then came the book on old-time Hollywood , and writing that had been bliss because she was her own boss and did n't have to answer to anyone . Doing the film on children was the biggest challenge of all . She had put it together herself . No small achievement . Especially for a woman , she thought cynically . She buzzed for the next actor to be sent in , and lit up a cigarette , inhaling deeply . How was Neil doing in Palm Beach with the wonderful George Lancaster ? Not that it bothered her either way . If they got him it would be good box office . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  someone who would make the character of the old cop come alive . A far more exciting prospect . She opened the script which lay on her desk and flicked through pages . It could be a great movie . With Neil directing , she was sure that it would be . So what was a guy supposed to do ? Let his new bride starve ? Because that 's what was going to happen if he did n't score some bucks soon . Buddy sat disconsolately behind the wheel of his car and thought it all out . Yet again . He had been doing so much thinking lately that his head felt as if it wanted to bust right open . He was an actor . That was his trade . Could n't land one job . So ? What79 other job paid enough to keep him afloat , and still available to go on interviews ? He was n't about to park cars for a living . The answer was simple . No big deal when you really thought about it . Half an hour in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free time to spend with Angel . And what Angel did n't know ... His mind was made up . He checked out his appearance in the rearview mirror , ruffled his hair , and hooded his smoky black eyes . Satisfied with his appearance , he leaped out of the car , and with his thrusting walk in overdrive , headed toward the men 's store Gladrags owned on Santa Mon- ica Boulevard . Six years before it had been a hole in the wall selling leather accessories . Since that time Gladrags had bought the buildings on either side and expanded . Now the store had glass windows which extended for a quarter of a block , and sold everything from Cerruti suits to cashmere jock straps . Buddy was impressed . He wondered if he could get a discount . Inside the store a perfumed transvestite hurried over to greet him . " Hel-lo , " the lame-clad creature gushed in a disturbingly masculine voice . " And what can I do for you ? " Buddy took an involuntary step backward . Gays . They always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Transvestite fluttered long false lashes . " Do you mean Mr. Jackson ? " " Is that Gladrags ? " " I beg your pardon ? " " Black guy . Tall . Wears lots of leather . " " Sounds like Mr. Jackson . " " Tell him Buddy 's here . " " I would simply love to . But Mr. Jackson never comes in before one . " He put a manicured nail pensively to his chin . " Perhaps you 'd like to wait . " " Hey , " snapped Buddy . " I ca n't wait . I got things to do . " " I 'm sure you have . " Transvestite was in love . Amber eyes swam with the promise of devotion . " Where can I reach him now ? " " I really ca n't say . " " Force yourself . " " Oh , dear . You see , Mr. Jackson has strict rules about giving out his home address and phone number . " Buddy narrowed his eyes tough-guy style . " An ' I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transvestite fluttered sensitive hands . " What do you think I should do ? " 80 Buddy winked . " Give me the address and nobody will be any the wiser ' cept the two of us . Our secret . Right ? " Transvestite smiled nervously . " If you say so . " It was no wonder George Lancaster loved living in Palm Beach . In Beverly Hills or Palm Springs he was just another retired superstar . There were dozens of them around  --  Sinatra , Astaire , Kelly , Hope . You could trip over them every time you ventured out of the house or onto the golf course . In Palm Beach , George Lancaster reigned supreme . He was king . Or at least prince consort to his wife , Pamela London , the third-richest woman in America . Neil Gray sniffed around the two of them warily at a luncheon in his honor . Pamela was a woman to be wary of , known for her sharp tongue and acid wit . She had been married four times ; George was her fifth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of saying . " None of them could keep it up longer than that . With the exception of George , of course . " She was fifty-four years old , a large-boned woman over six feet tall , with a wild mass of red frizzy hair . George was an extremely well-preserved sixty-two . He had been marriedtwice before . The first time to a childhood sweetheart for thirty-two years , the result of that union being his daughter , Karen . And the second to a Hollywood bitch for nine months , three days , and two minutes exactly . Pamela and George made an imposing couple . During five years of marriage they had forged an amicable animosity toward each other . Insults ruled the day , but togetherness was the name of the game . " So , " Pamela said , cornflower-blue eyes raking Neil . " You want old George to get his big fat rump back to work . Is that it ? " Neil smiled and glanced down the other end of the long table where George was deep in conversation with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far away as possible ; she knew it was George he had come to see . " If he wants to , " he said easily . " If he wants to , " she sneered . " If I want him to , you mean . " Neil had known Pamela for years . At one time she had been married to a movie producer friend of his , lived in Beverly Hills , and they had moved in the same social circles . She did n't intimidate him . He kept smiling . " George likes the script , he likes me . What would be so bad about taking a break from all this luxury ? You could come along for the ride . " She laughed hoarsely . " You know how I love Beverly Hills . Little starlets showing everything they 've got . Dreadful old men wearing gold81chains and cracked suntans . Cheap people , Neil , darling , I hate cheap people ! " " Do n't come then , " he said mildly . " George could fly back here every Friday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a private plane , " Pamela laughed . " Two , in fact . " " I know . But why use your plane when the production would supply whatever George requires ? " She raised an eyebrow . " Whatever he requires ? " " Name it . " " Hmmm . " She looked thoughtful . Neil chalked up a small victory . The very rich loved the thought of getting something for nothing . " Well ? " he pressed . " I 'm thinking about it . " " What 'll it take for you to make up your mind ? " She indicated his glass of Perrier water . " Why are n't you drinking ? " " Do n't change the subject . " " I hate a man who does n't drink . It makes me uneasy . " He summoned a hovering waiter . " A double Jack Daniel 's on the rocks . " Then he turned back to Pamela . " I would n't want you to feel uneasy . " She grinned coquettishly . " You are looking good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit of slumming . " They were eating luncheon at the Palm Beach Country Club , an intimate luncheon for thirty guests , none of whom Neil knew , and most of them over the half-century mark . Suddenly he felt depressed surrounded by his contemporaries . He thought briefly of Montana and her exciting youth . He never felt the age difference when they were together . He felt it now surrounded by face lifts , expensive jewelry , and liver-spotted hands . Then he remembered Gina Germaine waiting patiently at the hotel where they had checked into adjoining suites earlier in the day . She never made him feel old either . She made him feel young . Or at least she made his body feel young . His cock feel young . " A cent for every dirty little thought that 's clicking through your head , " Pamela said suddenly . " What ? " Neil was startled . She smiled . " I always know when a man 's thinking about sex . " " Not me . " She raised an eyebrow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cotton wool where you should have balls ? " He laughed . " You 're wasted here , Pamela . You should be writing steamy novelettes. " 82 " What makes you think I have n't tried it ? I 've tried almost everything else . " She leered at him . All the money in the world and her teeth were still yellow . " Except you , Neil , dear . All these years and we 've never taken a tumble together . You know , we should make up for lost time . " She patted his knee intimately . " And I always was a sucker for a British accent . So classy , so Richard Burton . In fact , I do believe you look a little like dear Richard . That same ravaged expression , that same  --  " " Pamela . " He removed her hand . " Stop making detours and let 's get to the point . Do you or do you not want George to make my film ? " " Goddam ! " screamed Ross , slamming down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fish . Goddam parasites ! Hi , Ross .... Yeah , Ross .... Nothing doing , Ross . What did they know ? They knew nothing . They knew fuck-all . They could n't even wipe their ass without ripping off ten percent of the toilet tissue . All of his career he had brought everything to them . Call Fox . Call Paramount . Call Wilder . Call Zanuck . Jobs came to him . No agent had ever had to run his balls off on Ross Conti 's behalf . Now , after twenty-five years of dropping it in their laps , he wanted some action . " What about the new Neil Gray film ? " he had asked Zack Schaeffer . " I hear it could be right for me . " Do n't know about it , Ross .... I 'll look into it , Ross .... I 'll call you back , Ross .... Why did n't he know about it ? It was his job to know about it . Sadie La Salle would know about it , and it was she who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he yelled . Lina poked her head around the door . " Meesus Conti go exercise class . You want coffee ? " He swore savagely under his breath . Elaine was never around when he needed her , only when he did n't . " Yes , " he growled . Lina departed , and he sat by the phone and sulked . Sadie La Salle . She had started it all . Grudgingly he had to admit that without Sadie and her billboard it might never have happened for him . And how had he paid her back ? He had run off with the first beautiful pair of tits that pointed in his direction , and signed with a big agency . No goodbye . No note . No phone call . Just a fast walk while she was out one day . If all had gone according to plan , Sadie La Salle should have just faded83from his life never to be heard from again . And she did vanish  --  for a while . He did n't hear a thing about her as his career started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name mentioned it was nothing to get excited about . So she wanted to be an agent . Big deal . Without him she had no clients . She found an unknown comic named Tom Brownie and built him into the biggest club act since Red Skelton . Then she nursed along a neurotic singer by the name of Melody Fame and turned her into the new Garland . Adam Sutton was struggling in B pictures when he joined the stable . Within two years his name was number one at the box office . George Lancaster defected from ICM . They all came running . Over the years she had built up the best client list in Hollywood . Sadie La Salle . Short fat Sadie with the mustache . Occasionally they ran into each other at parties and premieres . The mustache was gone ; costly electrolysis had taken care of that . She had dropped thirty pounds and her clothes were expensive and well cut . A stylish bob replaced unruly black curls . She was no beauty but she was certainly an improvement . He tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He attempted conversations . She walked away . In the early seventies he decided he needed her . Purely professionally , of course . So he called her on the phone , got as far as her secretary , and suggested that Ms. La Salle might care to drop by and see him . She never returned his call . It burned the shit out of him . What kind of a grudge was she carrying ? He cornered her at the next party they both attended . She was with a gay dress designer  --  rumor had it she was a dyke . Ross knew better than that . " Sadie , " he breezed . " I think you just got lucky . Guess what ? " He flashed the famous Conti smile . " I 'm on the market for a new agent and it might just be you . " She glared at him coldly . " I 'm not looking for any more clients , Ross . " Hurt . Surprise . Fix her with the famous baby blues . " It 's been fifteen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , " she said tightly . " If making commission on you gave me my one hot meal of the week I 'd starve to death . Do we understandeach other , Ross ? " Bitch ! Dyke ! Slimmed-down cunt ! He had not exchanged a word with her since . Maybe it was time to try again , now that he was married to Elaine and another ten years had gone by. 84 " Meester Conti . " Lina stood solidly in the doorway , her legs like tree trunks emerging from the white uniform Elaine insisted she wear . He turned off the sulks and managed a smile . Must n't let the fans down . " Yes , Lina , what is it ? " " Miguel sick . Okay I bring boy in ? " Why the hell was she bothering him ? Domestic matters were Elaine 's province . God knows he shelled out enough money to see that everything ran smoothly . " What boy ? " he asked , annoyed because he had wanted Miguel to wash the Corniche . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do pool ? " " Can he drive ? " " Sure he drive . " " Fine . Get him over here . Have him get the Corniche out , wash it , and I want it ready by one o'clock . " Lina nodded and gave one of her rare smiles . " Where 's my coffee ? " Ross asked . She shook her head stupidly . " I forget . " " So bring it . " She backed from the room as the phone began to ring . Ross snatched the receiver to his ear and barked a sharp " Hello . " " Welcome back , baby , " whispered a low husky voice . " Who is this ? " " My , what a short memory you have . Was our afternoon at the beach such a forgettable experience ? I know it was a few weeks ago , but really , Ross . " He laughed . " Karen ! " " The very same . " " When can I see you ? " " You name a time and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your beach house . Three-thirty . " " I 'll be waiting . " " I 'll be coming . " " Oh I know , I know . " They both laughed . Elaine was late for her tennis lesson , and her coach , a swarthy New Yorker with teeth like dazzling snow and a grip like a samurai warrior , was not pleased . " Ten minutes late , Mrs. C. , is ten minutes lost . " So what ? she thought irritably . I 'm the one who 's paying . Or rather Ross is . After three years of feebly hitting the ball over the net she had finally decided she must excel . It had nothing to do with the fact that85Bibi Sutton had started to throw lavish tennis luncheons " for the girls " at her Bel-Air estate , and that Elaine had been invited once , performed like an amateur , and never been asked back . She stood stiffly on one side of the court , her calf muscles killing her because of two days ' hard work at Ron Gordino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Too punishing by far . She would cut it down to maybe three times a week . But what three days ? That was the problem . What were the in days to go ? When did Bibi Sutton attend ? The ball whooshed past her racquet and she made a halfhearted swipe but missed it . " Mrs. C. ! " her coach complained . She wished he would n't call her Mrs. C. It sounded altogether too familiar , and she was not one of those women who wished to be on intimate terms with her tennis coach . " The name is Conti , " she said sharply . " I know , " he replied , unabashed . " Now , do you think you can con- centrate , Mrs. C. ? " She glared at him . He had hairy legs with rigid thigh muscles which disappeared into crisp white shorts . She wondered how his cock was . Probably hairy and rigid and ... She shook her head sharply . What was she thinking about his cock for ? She could n't stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oncoming ball gracefully . " That 's better ! " he said . Encouraged , she indulged in a passable volley , darting nimbly around the court . Three-quarters of an hour later it was over , and sweating profusely she hurried to the changing rooms , where she took her third shower of the day . Ridiculous ! Her skin would dry up like a prune . Must remember not to do the exercise class on the same day as her tennis lesson . She took a small black leather Cartier pad from her purse and wrote a cryptic TENNIS GYM NO ! Then thoughtfully she added , ASK KAREN . Karen would most certainly know the right days to attend Ron Gordino 's class . She dressed slowly , feeling a little tired . And she wondered if all those vitamin pills her nutritionist had recommended were doing her any good . Ross had sneered when he had caught her swallowing a dozen pills a day . But when she told him they gave you energy , stopped colds , pre- vented cancer , improved your skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon changed his mind . And now he took them too . Plus ginseng , which was said to jazz up your sex drive . But it did n't seem to have done him any good . After three weeks away he had not so much as glanced in her direction . 86pages 87 , 88 ripped outand Lincolns . A delivery truck gave chase from a stoplight , and a kid drag-raced her lane to lane . By the time they hit Westwood , Ross was enjoying every minute of the wild ride . " You on for the beach ? " she asked , fixing his eyes with a different unspoken question . " Why not ? " The meeting with his accountant could wait . Let his businessmanager take care of it , that 's what he was paid to do , was n't it ? They made it to the door of her Malibu beach house in twenty minutes . Fifty-two seconds later they were rolling about on the thick pile rug groping at each other 's clothes . He mounted her like a stallion , ripping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eloquence surprised both of them . They each had appointments in town to hurry back to , and the next day he had left L.A. for the location . He was glad she had called him upon his return . Karen was going to be more than just a passing diversion . Of that he was sure . Gladrags resided in a penthouse apartment on Doheny Drive . He cohabitedwith a white interior designer by the name of Jason Swanide , and a hideous bulldog named Shag . Buddy pressed the door buzzer impatiently . Now that he had decided to follow his former career he was hot to trot . Jason answered the door . A plump dormouse of a man in a peacockbluejumpsuit festooned with gold jewelry . Shag accompanied him , took a perfunctory sniff at Buddy 's leg , and mounted it as though it were the randiest bitch in the neighborhood . " Hey ! " Buddy exclaimed , filled with horror . " Get it off me ! " " Down boy . Down ! " Jason ordered , tugging at Shag 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeez ! " Shag dismounted and growled threateningly . " And what can I do for you ? " Jason inquired archly , placing one beringed plump hand on his waist , checking Buddy out , and liking what he saw . " I 'm looking for Gladra  --  uh . . . Mr. Jackson . " " He 's dressing . We 're going to a wedding . Can I help ? " Jason beamed , then winked . " I 'd certainly like to . " Why did fags love him ? " It 's business , " Buddy said swiftly . " Private . I 'll only take a minute of his time . " Jason pursed fleshy lips . " Marvin does n't like conducting business at home . Is it about the shop ? " Marvin ! Buddy nodded and attempted to edge through the front door. 89growled , and Jason made a decision . " Oh , all right . Wait here , I 'll get him . " He waddled off on short stumpy legs , and Buddy reflected that he and Gladrags must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and black , and Jason so rounded and plump and white . Oh well , everyone to his own kick . He whistled softly between clenched teeth and hoped that Gladrags might have something for him right away . It would be nice to go home to Angel bearing gifts . " Who in the fuck are you ? " It was Gladrags himself , skinnier than Buddy remembered , his black hair cornrowed and decorated with mul- ticolored beads . " And what in the fuck you want ? " Nothing like a warm welcome . " Hey  --  my man  --  G.J. It 's me  --  BuddyGladrags slapped sharply away . " Come on , " Buddy persisted . " I used to Boy . You got ta remember me . " He stretched out a friendly hand , whichwork for you , man . Randy Felix brought me in . I was one of your best . " Gladrags sniffed deeply . " One of my best what ? " Buddy checked out the corridor . " Can I come in ? Can we talk ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I . . . uh . . . I wan na get back in action . See , I need some bucks like yesterday , an ' you were always pretty good at arranging things . " " I ai n't in that business no more , " Gladrags spat , sniffing again and beginning to close the door . " An ' even if I was  --  which I ai n't  --  believe me , man , I sure do remember you . You was the weirdo could only get it up for the ladies . Right ? And , if I remember correct , you dumped on an ' went inta business with that fat fucker Maxie Sholto . An ' with him I understand if it moved ya screwed it . So if I was in that business still , which as I said repeatedly I ai n't  --  then even if you farted Stars an ' Stripes , ' an ' sported a flag on your pecker every time ya got the bone  --  I still would n't be interested in puttin ' you together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He slammed the door sharply . " Shit ! " muttered Buddy sharply . " Goddam shit ! " Angrily he turned and strode toward the elevator . It was his own dumb fault . Jason Swanide caught up with him just as he was driving out of the underground garage . " So glad I found you , " he puffed , running up to the car , dragging a reluctant Shag behind him . Buddy glared . " Why ? " " Because I 'd like to help you . I think I can help you . " " You 're not my type , " snapped Buddy sarcastically . 90 " Take my card , " Jason insisted . " And call me on my business number . Tomorrow . " He thrust a small white card through the open window . It fluttered onto the floor of the car as Buddy put his foot down and roared off into the late-morning sun . The small Italian restaurant with its checked tablecloths , excellent pasta , and potent house wine was busy . Saturday night always brought out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leon felt ill at ease . He had promised Millie faithfully that the one thing he would never do was bring his problems home , and he had kept that promise up until the time of the Friendship Street murders . Up until the time he was faced with Joey Kravetz 's mutilated body . He remembered their second encounter . It was long before he met Millie . It was n't just raining , it was coming down in torrents . Driving home late , his windshield wipers fighting the downpour , Leon decided he was hungry after all . Only an hour previously he had phoned to cancel a dinner date with an attractive divorcee he had been seeing . She was nice enough , but deep down he found her boring . On impulse he made a left into a Howard Johnson 's and parked his car in a side lot . Then he hurried through the rain to a corner booth , where he ordered himself a toasted chicken sandwich and some hot coffee . Opening up the paper , he studied the sports page . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to relax after a long and tiring day . " You sonuvabitch ! " a voice screeched . Startled , he looked up from his newspaper and stared at the short , angry girl standing by his table , her arms crossed over a grubby T-shirt , her legs encased in army surplus trousers several sizes too big . " Do n't remember me , huh ? " She glared . " Should I ? " he asked at last . " Should ya ? Ha ! Should ya ? You can bet your fat butt ya should ! " He put down his paper . " Now wait a minute . Just who do you think you 're talking to ? " " You  --  cop ! " she spat . " Do I know you ? " he asked angrily . " Ya got my ass locked up in some girl 's prison for a fuckin ' year . You should know me , " she crowed triumphantly . It was then he noticed the cast in her eye , and suddenly it all came back . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , then kicked him on the leg when questioned about her age , and fled . He had called Grace Mann over on Juvenile , given her a general location and description , and left it in her capable hands . Grace had obviously come through . " I thought you said you were eighteen , " he accused . " So I lied  --  big deal . An ' ' cause of you they come trackin ' me , an ' locked me up on some crappy farm with a bunch of babies . Thanks a lot , cowboy . " He tried not to smile , she was so desperately angry , and he had no wish to inflame her further . " It was for your own good , " he said . " Screw you ! " she replied , and unexpectedly sat down . " My date never showed , so y'can buy me a coffee . I figure ya owe me a lot more than a crummy cuppa coffee . " She wiped the back of her hand across her nose , and hungrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eat ? " he asked . She was such a ragged-looking creature , he felt sorry for her . " Awright , " she agreed , as if she were doing him an enormous favor . " Gim me the same as you . " He signaled the waitress and gave her the order . She filled his coffee cup and hurried off . " What 's your name ? " Leon asked . " Joey , " she sniffed . " What 's it to you ? " " I 'm buying you a sandwich . I might as well know who you are . " She glared at him suspiciously , muttered , " Lousy cop , " and set upon her sandwich with ravenous ferocity when it arrived . Leon watched her eat , observing her short-bitten nails , grubby neck , and spiky orange-dyed hair . She was a mess , yet there was still something appealing about her . She 's bringing out the father instinct in me , he thought wryly . " I take it they let you out of the girl 's farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food for a runaway , I hope . " " They let me out , " she said between mouthfuls , " They had to when my sister finally came t'get me . ' Sides , I 'm sixteen now , I can look after myself . " " I 'm sure you can . " " You bet I can ! " She threw him a sly look . " Thanks t'you , really . " " How 's that ? " " Well ... if I had n't of hit on you , an ' you had n't of sent the kiddie patrol after me , I might never have got myself connected with all those boss chicks at the farm . Y'know , I met ' em all , an ' I learned me plenty . " It occurred to him that he should n't be sitting down with her . Quickly he gestured for the check . " Where ya goin ' ? " she demanded . " Home , " he replied , then added sarcastically , " That 's if you do n't mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least give me a ride , " she whined pathetically . " Just look at it out there . " He turned to stare out the large windows . The rain still pounded down . " What makes you think I 'm going your way ? " " Look  --  if it 's too much trouble just t'drop me at the bus station . I 'm goin ' to my sister , she lives outta the city , an ' I do n't wan na miss my bus . " He knew he should refuse her , but what the heck , he was off duty and she was only a kid . " Get your coat , " he sighed . " Do n't have no coat . " " In this weather ? " " Who knew it was goin ' to piss ? " He paid the check , took his raincoat from the rack in the corner , was about to put it on , then changed his mind and threw it over her shoulders . " Come on , " he said . They ran for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full force of the torrential rain hit her . " Come on , " Leon repeated , raising his voice as he opened the car door . She hurled herself inside like an angry puppy . In spite of the protection of his raincoat she was soaked through . He started the engine while she found disco on the radio , " Got a ciggie ? " she asked . " I gave it up , " he replied gruffly . " And that 's what you should do . " " Sure , " she sneered . " I mean , I got so much goin ' for me , why should I need cigarettes ? " He glanced at her and turned the radio down . " What time is your bus ? " She was silent for a moment , chewing on her thumb and wriggling on the seat . " What time ? " he repeated , slowing his speed as the rain increased . " It do n't matter what time , " she mumbled at last , " ' cause there 's no point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I thought you wanted to be dropped at the bus station . " " S'awright . I can sleep on one of them benches . I done it before . " He was rapidly losing patience with her . Clicking off the radio he said , " What are you talking about ? " " Well ... y'see , my sister 's gone off to Arizona to live on one of them communes . I was supposed to save some money an ' go join her , but my money was stolen . " She warmed to her story . " These two black cats ripped me off , wanted to put me on the streets an ' pimp off me , but I got away from ' em . Only thing is they got all the money 1 saved from workin ' , now I got ta start again . " She paused . " You got any money to spare ? I 'll screw ya for ten bucks . " Leon pulled the car over and stopped . " Get out , " he said sharply . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why ? " " You know why . " " I do n't know what  --  " " Get out . Or is it back to Juvenile ? They 'll find a bed for you . " " Pig bastard ! " she spat , realizing he was serious . He leaned across and opened the passenger door . Heavy rain blew into the car . Her voice quavered . " You 're throwin ' me out in this ? Why ca n't you take me to the bus station ? " " Because you 're full of it , the bus station is out of my way , and you 're a liar . Now  --  out . " Reluctantly she stepped from the car into the pounding rain . He slammed the door shut and drove off . She had her nerve . Doing it to him again . Propositioning him as if he was some john who had to pay for it . Maybe he should have taken her to Juvenile . Probably kinder than dumping her on the street. 94Jesus Christ ! Now he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was some lousy night . But then , he reasoned , she would n't thank him for handing her in , and she could look after herself . She was a tough little street kid . Besides , she was n't his responsibility . Angrily he drove home , parked underground , and took the elevator to his apartment . It was n't until he was standing under a hot shower that he realized she still had his raincoat . Millie leaned across the table and said , very softly , " Honey , if I left , would you miss me ? " " Huh ? " Startled , Leon returned to his surroundings . Millie patted his hand comfortingly . " Welcome back . " " I was just thinking . " " Oh , really ? " Her sarcasm was thick . " I would never have guessed . " " I was just thinking , " he repeated carefully , " about where we shouldspend our vacation this year . Have you thought about where you wouldI like to go ? " " California , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " We can afford it , ca n't we ? " " Sure we can . " " I 've always wanted to go to California , " she said , her eyes sparkling . " Have n't you ? " Leon frowned . He could honestly say that he had never had the faintest desire to visit the West Coast . As far as he was concerned , California was a land of sunshine , oranges , and freaks . " I 'll talk to a travel agent next week , " he promised . She beamed . " We have plenty of time , but it sure would be nice to get it all planned . " He smiled reassuringly and wondered if Deke Andrews had had it all planned . Had he planned to viciously hack three people to death ? Had he planned to leave the small house looking like an abattoir ? Had he planned to calmly wash up , walk out , and vanish ? The waiter appeared with two steaming plates of spaghetti with clam sauce . Leon felt his juices rising . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of turning him on nowadays was with a good hot plate of food . He did n't reply . He was n't up to playful banter about the growing infrequency of their sex life . It was n't that he no longer desired Millie , it was just that he was so goddam tired . And half the time when he got95into bed and closed his eyes the images that he saw were not erotic . They were of Deke Andrews . A photograph of him that had appeared in his senior class yearbook aged eighteen . " He never changed much from that I picture , " various witnesses had assured him . " Just grew his hair some . " The police artist had worked diligently on the photo , aging it eight years and adding the longer hair . It had then been circulated across the country . Leon knew the photo intimately . An ordinary boy with extraordinary eyes  --  burning black deadly eyes . They haunted him . And so did Joey 's mutilated body , her neck almost severed so grotesque were her wounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the plateful of spaghetti and felt distinctly nauseated . What was the matter with him ? Had to get hold of himself . Goddam ! He had lived through twenty years of gruesome murders and not one of them had ever affected him this way . He wound some spaghetti onto his fork and shoved it into his mouth . " Good , huh ? " asked Millie . Good , huh ? mocked Deke Andrews in his head . " ' Scuse me . " He pushed his chair away from the table , dropping his fork with a dull clatter . " Call of nature . I 'll be right back . " Millie 's eyebrows rose in surprise as he hurried out , seeking refuge in the men 's room . There he rested his head against the cold tile wall and made a decision . He would open up the Andrews file . He would apply to the captain for permission , and if he did n't get it , he would work on the case in his spare time . Suddenly he felt better. 9611Elaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a voluminous white linen coat ; , Casually she glanced around as she strolled through the makeup department of Bullock 's , Westwood . Unobserved , she pocketed a seventy-dollar bottle of Opium as she passed by a display table . Her eyes darted this way and that as she added a ceramic hand mirror and a Lucite lipstick holder to the scent already in her pocket . By this time her heart was beating wildly , but her casual stroll never faltered . She drifted through to the sunglasses department and managed to pocket two sixty-dollar pairs before taking the escalator down to the linens and notions . There she was accosted by a middle-aged saleslady in black and rhinestones who said , " And what can I do for you today , madam ? " " Nothing , thank you , " Elaine replied . " I 'm just looking . " " Do go ahead , please . I 'll keep my eye on you should you find that you need me . " Elaine swallowed annoyance , smiled , and beat a hasty retreat to men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silk Yves Saint Laurent tie to her collection of goodies . She looked around and noted a male assistant checking her out . Her heart was really pounding now . It was enough . Slowly she sauntered toward the exit . Leaving was always the moment of truth . What if a hand descended on her shoulder as she stepped outside ? What if a voice said , " Wouldyou mind coming back inside for a moment ? " What if she was caught ? Absolutely impossible . She was far too careful . She only took whenshe was sure no hidden eyes or cameras were watching . And she only97took items priced at under a hundred dollars . Somehow she felt that was safe . Outside . On the street . No heavy hand on her shoulder . She walked to the Mercedes , which was parked at a meter on Westwood Boulevard , removed her linen coat , its pockets filled with ill-gotten gain , folded it carefully , and placed it in the trunk . Then she took off her hat and sunglasses and threw those in too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illicit shopping sprees gave her . Better than an affair any day . Humming softly she climbed into the car . Elaine had been successfully shoplifting for over a year . Once a week , regularly , she donned what she called her " disguise " and hit a department store or a boutique . Department stores were safer , but the boutiques gave the biggest thrill of all . There you could really go to town , slipping a scarf , a silk knit sweater , or even a pair of shoes into your pocket right under some snappy little salesgirl 's nose . Oh , the excitement ! The kick ! The shot of adrenaline that kept her vibrating for hours and hours ! The greatest high of all ! It had started by accident , really . She had been standing in Saks one day waiting for attention at the Clinique makeup counter . She needed face powder in a hurry , she was late for a lunch date , exhausted from a dance class ( studying modern ballet had been the in thing to do then ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly , the easiest thing in the world had been to slip the box of powder  --  conveniently situated on the front of the counter  --  into her purse , and saunter quietly out of the store . She had quite expected to be stopped , and then coolly , calmly , she would just have explained that she was merely making a little protest , taking a stand against the gross rudeness of salesgirls who preferredconversation with each other to attending to a customer . Would they have believed her ? She was Mrs. Ross Conti . Of course they would . But she was n't stopped . Not then . Not the next time . Nor the time after that . What had started out as a protest soon changed into a habit . An unbreakableone . " Buddy , " Angel whispered softly . " Can I meet your agent ? " " What ? " He frowned . They lay side by side on the narrow bed in Randy Felix 's borrowed apartment watching a game show on a badly functioning black-and-white television . She sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes shining98with enthusiasm . " I 've been thinking , " she announced . " It 's silly , me sitting at home all day when I could be trying for a job too . If I met your agent he could send me up for things . Would n't it be terrific if I got something ? " He spaced his words carefully . " It 's not a good idea . " Now it was her turn to frown . " Why ? " she demanded plaintively . " Why yes ? " " Because , " she replied quickly , " things do n't seem to be coming easily for you , and I 'd like to help . Before I went to Hawaii I had made up my mind that I wanted to be an actress . " He breathed deeply , evenly . It had not been a good day . " Are you saying you do n't think I can look after you ? " Her eyes widened . " I know you 'll always look after me . But we do need money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Who says ? " She gestured helplessly around the cramped room . " Well , this is n't our apartment . The car we have is falling to pieces , and you 're so jumpy lately . Honestly , Buddy , I 'm not complaining . I just want to help out . " " Fuck ! " He exploded , jumping off the bed , pulling tight Levi 's over French Y-fronts , and grabbing a shirt . She looked alarmed . " What 's the matter ? " He snatched his wallet and keys from the top of the television . " You want to hassle me ? Make me feel like nothing ? Do it on your own time , lady . " Before she could even reply he slammed his way out of the apartment . Angel was shocked . She had not expected such a violent reaction . In fact , what she had expected was a tender scene between the two of them in which Buddy swore deep love and gratitude for her being such an understanding and helpful wife . Tears filled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that was so unacceptable ? Were n't married couples supposed to stick together , tell each other everything , and have no secrets ? As the days passed , and Buddy became more irritable and no starring role or even a bit part materialized , she had slowly begun to realize that things were not exactly as he had told her they would be . Not that she minded . She had read enough fan magazines in her life to know that Getting There and Making It were not always a fast jog up the yellow brick road . Sometimes there were Pitfalls and Hold-ups . Buddy had been away , and now it would just take him a little time to get back up where he belonged . But while he was waiting , why could n't she have a chance too ? She only wanted to help. 99Tearfully she climbed off the bed and straightened the covers . How she longed for him to come running back , hold her in his arms , tell her everything was all right , and make slow gentle love to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slender body . Buddy . If he did n't want her to work she 'd never mention it again . Buddy . She loved him so much . He was all she had , and she planned to stay with him forever . " Have you ever considered a red-hot prick up the ass ? " asked an agitated masculine voice . " Do me a favor and go jerk off on your own time . " Montana replaced the receiver briskly . Obscene phone calls . How did the cretins get hold of the numbers in the first place ? Did they scour the phone books looking for single-female listings ? Or did they lurk around the supermarkets and stores checking out customers and their charge cards ? Who knew ? Who really cared ? Energetically she leaped out of bed . A wave of well-publicized violence was spreading fear throughout the hills of Hollywood , Beverly , and Holmby . People were into security gates , guard dogs , electronic alarm systems , and guns . Montana bothered with none of the precautions . She refused to live a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an obscene phone caller hoped to upset her day he had the wrong number . Humming tunelessly , she launched into a few yoga positions out by the pool . It was only eight o'clock . A clear smogless day  --  and she had an insane desire to trash everything and drive out to the beach . Why not ? Many reasons . Twenty actors with appointments scheduled exactly fifteen minutes apart . A meeting with the young dress designer she wanted to hire for the film . A trip to the airport to surprise Neil on his return from Palm Beach . For the first time she felt really good about living in L.A. She was glad that Neil had talked her into letting him buy the house a few months back . They had leased their New York apartment , packed up forty cartons of books , records , and assorted possessions , and fmally made L.A. more than just a hotel suite . Neil loved California . She had always been a city kid , but she could change , could n't she ? For Neil she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still she loved him , probably more than in the beginning , because in the beginning it had been lust . She grinned at the100thought . She , who had only climbed into bed with body beautifuls and youth . Then along came Neil Gray with his middle-aged spread , graying hair , and bloodshot eyes . She had wanted him then . And she wanted him now . Just as much . He had given her more than body beautiful and youth . He had given her knowledge , and in the long run that 's what life was really all about . Working together was a new phase in their relationship , and so far it seemed a definite bonus . He cared about the movie just as much as she did  --  in fact , that 's all they ever seemed to talk about . Not that she was complaining  --  what more could she want ? She wondered if he had landed George Lancaster . Even bigger question . How would she feel if he had ? Disappointed . The more she thought about it the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said in his highly unoriginal way , " A star is a star is a star . " 11She dressed quickly in a Calvin Klein jacket , chain-store jeans , a six-1 dollar T-shirt , and two-hundred-dollar cowboy boots . The mix suited her , especially when she pulled her luxuriant black hair tightly from her face and twisted it into a long braid . Skipping breakfast , she slipped behind the wheel of her battered Volkswagen . Neil was always nagging her to buy a new car , but the VW suited her . It was n't flash , she could drive around the city virtually unnoticed , and that 's the way she liked it . Actors . Twenty more today . Maybe one she wanted  --  one who was right  --  one who would walk into her office and bring a character she had created to life . God ! Putting this movie together was exciting . More exciting than anything she had done in her life before . Moviemaking . It got in your blood . And she and Neil together  --  what a team ! Grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to her office . " Why ca n't you get me a copy of the goddam script ? " Ross screamed into the phone . " Christ almighty , Zack , I 'm not asking for a table at the Last Supper . All I want is a lousy script . Ninety frigging pages bound together . Sounds like a simple enough task to me . " He tapped the glass Kahle beside the pool with angry fingers as he listened to the answer . The answer was that Street People appeared to be under lock and key . Nobody had a copy  --  but nobody . Only George Lancaster and Tony Curtis and Kirk Douglas and SadieI La Salle and Christ knows who else . Probably half of fucking Hollywood . 101He slammed the phone down in disgust . Here he was , a major star , chasing a part in some half-assed frigging movie written by a woman , no less , and he had n't even seen the script . What the fuck was the matte with him ' ? Was he losing his smarts along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool house in a panic . Wha made him think he was losing his hair ? He was n't . No way . Well , maybe a little . Nothing noticeable . Nothing that combing it differently could n't take care of . He studied his reflection in the mirrored poolhouse . Ross Conti . Movie star . Still a good-looking son of a bitch . Only he and Paul Newman had kept it all together . The others had fallen to pieces  --  got fat , bald , had disastrous face lifts , wore bad toupees . Sinatra still looked good , though , with his sewn-on thatch . Still had a set of pipes that kept them creaming their panties when they heard his world-weary tones . Satisfied , Ross returned poolside . Elaine was framed in the glass entrance to the living room . Elaine . His wife . She did n't look bad for an old broad . One thing about her  --  she kept herself in good shape , did n't drink , screw around , or make a fool of him . " Honey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do something for me . " She looked him up and down . He was definitely developing a gut . Quite noticeable in the madras shorts he had chosen to wear . " I 'll do anything you want , Ross , dear , " she said sweetly , " as long as you promise me you 'll start going to the gym again . " He feigned surprise and patted his stomach . " You think I need it ? " " Everyone over twenty-five needs it . " " What is this everyone over twenty-five ' crap ? " " A fact of life , my darling . The older one gets the harder one has to work at looking good . " " Bullshit . " " Truth . " " Bullshit . " She sighed . " What is it you want me to do ? " He scratched his chin and squinted the famous blues . " Call Maralee Gray . Get hold of a copy of Neil 's new script , the one we were talking about . " " Could n't Zack get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ milk from a cow if you handed him the tit ! " Elaine nodded . He was finally coming around to her way of thinking " I need Sadie La Salle , " Ross suddenly blurted . He was definitely coming around to her way of thinking . " Do you wan me to see if I can arrange it ? " she asked slowly . 102 He looked enthusiastic . " You think you can ? " She smiled . " You 've always said I can do anything I set my mind to . " " So I 'm giving you the word . Set your mind to getting me Sadie La Salle and a copy of that damn script . " Her smile widened . There was nothing Elaine liked better than a challenge . " Ross , sweetheart , you 're on ! " He smiled back . " Elaine , sweetheart , my money 's on you . " Marital bliss at last . " I bought you a present , " she murmured , handing him the Saint Laurent silk tie she had stolen earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ star , huh ? " he said with a big grin . She nodded . " Always , Ross . Always . " Maverick 's was crowded , the bar six deep , disco music blasting eardrums . Buddy had n't been there in a long while  --  before Hawaii  --  before the days of fat little Maxie Sholto . He shuddered when he thought of Maxie . Fortunately he had woken up to reality before it was too late . No more drugs and orgies for Buddy Boy . That scene was purely for life 's losers . Flitting on Gladrags for work was one thing . Maxie Sholto was a whole different ballgame . " Buddy ! Good t'see you . Where y'been hiding ? " He waved at the barman . " Around , " he replied . " Here and there . What 's happening ? " " Same old story . Business is good . Didja hear about me on Hill Street Blues ? I had lines , man , lines . " Yeah ? So why was he still behind the bar at Maverick 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Is Quince around ? " " In the back . " " Thanks . " He made his way to the end of the crowded bar and across a jammed dance floor and edged along a line of booths looking for Quince . He found him surrounded by girls . Three of them . Quince . Tall . Black . Good-looking . A good actor too . They had worked together at Joy Byron 's . " Hey , man . " They spoke in unison , and slapped palms . " Sit , " Quince said . " Join the party . " Buddy squeezed on the end of the leather banquette while Quince indicated the girls one by one . " This is my ladey , Luann . Her sister , c'hickie . And a good friend , Shelly . " Luann was a gorgeous chocolate blond . Chickie was smaller , darker , with a set of teeth Farrah would kill for . Shelly was Shelly , the girl from the pool , looking good in a scant purple leotard and thin wrapover skirt . " Hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey , " she replied . " Buddy Hudson . Mister Married . Where 's your old lady ? " " Buddy . Married . That 'll be the day , " laughed Quince . Shelly nodded . " He 's married . " Quince raised an unbelieving eyebrow and grinned at Buddy . " Tell ' em it ai n't true , my man . " Buddy scowled . His luck to run into Miss Bigmouth . It just was n't his day . Or night . " So I 'm married , big deal , " he mumbled . Quince began to laugh . " I never thought the day would come when you would fall into that scene . What happened ? " He hit his forehead with the palm of his hand . " I know , I know . She 's eighty-three , loaded , an ' she has a reaaal bad heart . Am I hittin ' it ? " Buddy 's scowl deepened . He had run out on Angel to find a little relaxation . " Yeah , yeah , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Only she 's nearer ninety than eighty-three . More my speed , y'know ? " Quince guffawed loudly . " That 's my Buddy Boy ! Always one eye on the main chance ! " " How about a little boogie ? " requested Chickie , jigging about to the strains of a Donna Summer hit . " Sorry , " Shelly intervened . " I asked first . " She bumped against Buddy , forcing him to stand , then she slid from the booth , flung her arms around his neck , and pulled him toward the packed dance floor . " Eighty-three my ass , " she sneered . " Twenty and goddam spectacular . I 've seen her out by the pool . Why are you keepin ' her a secret ? " He shrugged . " No secret . " " No shit ? So where is she , then ? " " What are you  --  a dyke ? " She pushed her crotch sharply against his . " If I was , baby , I 'd be scratchin ' at your front door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home . " He shoved her roughly away and went into his disco routine . He could give Travolta lessons  --  that 's how smooth and sensuous and goddam raunchy he was . Allan Carr , walk in and see me now ! Shelly matched him move for move . She was good too . He began to enjoy himself . It was the first dancing he 'd done in a long time , and when you had a partner who was with you all the way , well , that was a real hot feeling . They stopped when they 'd had enough . When sweat coursed in little104rivers down Shelly 's bare arms and chest . " Hmmm , " she said succinctly , " you 're good . " " So are you . " They returned to the table . " I should hope so . I 'm a professional . " " A professional what ? " She regarded him coolly . " Dancer . " She turned to greet a new arrival who had moved in next to Chickie . " Jer , babes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a young good-looking guy with nervous , shifty eyes . He shrugged . " The same crapshoot . Y'know the scene . " " Yeah , " she agreed sympathetically . " Hey  --  have you two met ? " They shook heads negatively , summing each other up . " Buddy Hudson  --  JerichoCrunch , " Shelly continued , the perfect hostess . Buddy frowned . The loud music must be getting to him . Jericho Crunch ! What kind of a name was that ? Sounded like a religious Famous Amos ! Jericho 's shifty eyes checked him over . " Are you an actor ? " " What did you see me in ? " Buddy asked quickly . " Nothin ' . I 'm an actor too . " " Yeah . What have you done ? " Jericho reeled off a few familiar television shows , then licked his lips and added , " But I 'm up for the big one . Think I 'm gon na get it , too . " " What big one ? " Buddy asked , immediately alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about . " " A television pilot ? " " Nope . " " A commercial ? " " Nope . " " So  --  what ? " " A movie . A real biggie . " " A television film ? " " Nope . The real thing . " " What 's it called ? " Jericho narrowed his eyes . " You think I 'm gon na tell you so you can go runnin ' after it , too . No way . Besides , I 'm almost set . I got the castin ' bitch creamin ' at the thought of usin ' me , " he leered . " Get the picture ? " Yes . Buddy got the picture . And the pisser was not about to give away a thing . He thought about Angel . She had n't meant to nag . She had just caught him at a bad moment when all he had left in the world was fortytwobucks and no idea where to score . Unemployment was out . He had never wanted to get involved with forms and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start now . " Got ta split , " he said , rising from the table . He pushed through the crowds , and took a deep breath as he hit the street. 105Shelly followed him out . " I need a lift home , " she said . He looked her over and decided she might be useful . " Sure . My car 's down the block . " She walked beside him , smelling slightly of sweat and a heavy musk scent . " What kind of dancing you do ? " he asked . " Artistic , " she replied . " A stripper , huh ? " " One of the best . " " Modest . " " Screw you . I am one of the best , and proud of it . " They reached the car , and he slid into the driver 's seat , springing the passenger lock for her . " And you 're an actor , " she stated , settling herself comfortably . " I should have guessed . " " One of the best , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why you 're driving this pile of crapola . " " It gets me around . I 'm not into image . " " Ca n't afford to be , huh ? " " I 'm gettin ' by . " She extracted a joint from her purse and lit up . " I 'll tell you somethin ' , " she said , offering him a toke , which he declined , because who needed to get stopped by the cops at this time of the morning ? " You 'd make a terrific stripper . You 've got the body an ' you 've got all the right moves . " He laughed aloud . " You have to be kidding . " She was unamused . " What 's so funny ? It pays good , and just as many guys are doin ' it today . " " I 'm an actor . I told you . " " That does n't mean you ca n't take off your clothes and get paid for it . " " I guess you think Sylvester Stallone did that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't you read gossip ? " " You ca n't believe the junk you read in those rags . What about yourfriend  --  Brunch  --  Crunch  --  the great wall of Jericho . He take ' em off ? " " Undressed he 's bad news . Sloped shoulders , knock knees , nothin ' much in the bread bin . He does a bit of waitering  --  Hollywood parties . Thinks he 'll get discovered that way . " The hell with it . Buddy reached for the joint and took a long satisfying pull , then casually he said , " Maybe it worked for him . Like , what 's this movie he says he 's all set for ? " " Oh , c'm on . You do n't believe that , do you ? If Jer served a canape to Johnny Carson he 'd tell everyone he was all set for The Tonight Show ! " 106 " So there 's no movie ? " " He went on an interview . " " For what ? " She laughed softly . " Wan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased the car into a convenient parking space opposite their apartment house . " It 's a free country . " " If you say so . " " So what 's the movie ? " " Come up for a snort . Coke always jogs my memory . " He thought of Angel . Beautiful . Innocent . Waiting . Then he thought of forty-two lousy bucks . " Sure . Why not ? " Gina Germaine had an agent , a manager , a secretary , a makeup artist , a hairdresser , an accountant , a business counselor , an acting coach , and two ex-husbands to support . Sort of . They all depended on her for something . She was thirty-three years old  --  twenty-nine to the press . Blond  --  dyed , not natural . Pretty , with round , slightly protruding blue eyes , a retrousse nose , and a maneater mouth filled with sharp white perfect teeth . There were thousands of girls on the West Coast of America who were just as pretty as Gina Germaine . But her body made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-inch waist , and an enormous bosom . Thirty-nine firm fruity inches with huge pale-chocolate nipples . Gina Germaine became a star because of her amazing breasts . Featuredin Playboy at the age of nineteen , she was immediately discovered by Hollywood . " Send for her at once , " demanded two studio heads , three corporate executives , and four enthusiastic agents . She was alrgady in town . Maxie Sholto , a canny hustler who knew a sensational pair of boobies when he saw them , had gotten there first . " Let me represent you , " he had said , his shifty smile going full force . " Let me make you a star . " The old-fashioned but meaningful words worked . Gina packed up a so-so modeling career in Houston , Texas , and flew with Maxie to Los Angeles , where he got her a few bit parts here and there . Nothing spectacular . Until one day she walked into a television executive 's private office , sat on a high-backed chair opposite him , and casually spread her long skinny sexy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The executive 's bloodshot eyes bulged with excitement . Gina Germaine was wearing a short white mini-skirt with nothing underneath . No panty hose , no panties . Nothing . She landed a role in a weekly television sitcom , and a weekly rendez-107vous with her television executive , who expired two years later from a massive stroke . Gina was sorry to see him go . He was such a sweet old guy . But then again she really did n't need him anymore . Television had made her a star , and Maxie had made her his wife . Gina 's television show lasted five years , her marriage only a few months longer , but Maxie and she parted friends , and he was best man at her well-publicized wedding to a macho actor whose main hobby was beating her up , so she divorced him too . Her personal life was chaos , but her star continued to rise . A movie spinoff from her series had made big bucks at the box office . And she followed this with another money spinner . She was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big screen . All at once she was hot . Every movie she did made money . She supported sagging superstars , played straight lady to zany comedians , jiggled , wriggled , and took her clothes off with monotonous regularity . The public did n't think so . The public loved her . She was their Gina . A gorgeous package of golden flesh . A movie-star whore with a heart of gold and tits to match . An old-fashioned type of movie star who evoked memories of Monroe and Mansfield . " I want to be taken seriously , " she cooed on the Johnny Carson show one night . " Y'know , John , I want to do different kinds of films  --  something with a social message . " Johnny had just looked to camera , his face a study in restraint ; his expression said it all . The audience had roared with laughter , and Gina was smart enough to shut up and return to sticking out her tits and indulging in playful flirts . Inside she was seething with frustration . Why should n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray at a party . He was with his wife , but a little obstacle like a wife had never bothered Gina . What she wanted , she got . One of the advantages of being a film star . Neil Gray was serious with a capital S. He made important movies , meaningful movies . The kind of movies Gina knew she should be doing . She moved in quietly . Flattered him , hung on his every word , made sure he got a good view of the amazing boobs when she leaned across him to reach for a cigarette , a drink , a scoop of dip . Three days later she called . " I hope I 'm not disturbing you , " she said in a throaty voice , knowing full well that if she was having her usual effect she was disturbing him a great deal . " But I really do need some good advice , and you seem like just the person to help me . " He was amused , intrigued . He knew " some good advice " meant " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ language of Hollywood. 108Lunch . Her house . A walled estate on San Ysidro Drive . Salade Nicoise followed by solid fucking . Neither of them had the patience or the inclination to waste time . A second rendezvous two weeks later . Same scenario . They did not talk much , but Gina did n't mind . Once a man got lost in her beautiful boobs he always came back for more . There would be plenty of time for talking . She studied Montana at the dinner the Grays threw at the Bistro to announce their film . She was there with Chet Barnes . It sure startled the pants off Neil . But he need n't have worried  --  she was cool . She even chatted politely to Montana , told her about her own screenplay . Not that she had written it yet , but she was going to . So , Street People was to be Neil 's new film . The next day she called her agent , Sadie La Salle , and demanded a copy of the script . " Nobody has seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think It 's your type of thing . From what I understand it 's about two cops , an old one and a young one . " " There must be women in it , " Gina interrupted tartly . " Well , I expect so . But no star roles . I 'm sure it 's not a Gina Germaine vehicle . " She paused . " Now tell me , dear , did you read And Baby Makes ... ? " " No , " Gina snapped . " Get me a copy of Neil 's film , Sadie . Let me decide if it 's a Gina Germaine vehicle or not . " When Neil Gray phoned and suggested a weekend in Palm Beach , Gina said yes without a moment 's hesitation . " It 'll be separate everything , " he warned . " Rooms , travel , everything . " " Sure , " she agreed . " You might get bored . I 'll have to spend time with Pamela and George . " " I 'll bring a book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read it . She filched a copy of Street People from Neil 's suitcase the second he left their adjoining suites , and read it in fifty-five minutes flat . Then she read it through again , concentrating on the part of Nikki . A buzz of excitement , a jolt of adrenaline . NIKKI-EARLY TWENTIES-UNSPOILED BEAUTY-FANTASTIC BODY ALTHOUGHNOT OVERSTATED-NATURAL BLONDE-CERTAIN INNOCENT QUALtrY . I could play Nikki . I could . I could . And it was a marvelous role . A catalyst between the two male parts . Daughter of one . Lover of the other . I could play the hell out of a character like Nikki. 109She was too old . I 've always looked younger than my age . She was hardly unspoiled . Good acting would take care of that . Her fantastic body was more than a little overstated . No shit ? I 'll diet . I 'll bind the old boobies down . I 'll fucking starve i necessary . Innocent ? I can fake it . She could hardly wait for Neil to get back . He looked tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to bed . " Pamela 's a devious old bird , " he managed , as she started to unzip his pants . " Really ? " she questioned . " Why ? " " Because . . . " he began , then groaned . She had him in her mouth an she was blowing him as if her life depended on it , but then , in a way , it did . Arriving back in Los Angeles , Neil issued orders as they were leaving the plane . " You 'd better wait five minutes . I 'll go ahead . " Gina pouted . " Ashamed of being seen with me ? " " Do n't be ridiculous . We agreed to be discreet . " She sighed . " Okay . But I will see you soon , wo n't I ? " " Sooner than you think . " He pecked her on the cheek and hurried o his way . Most men were such bastards . But what did she care ? She used them . No way did they use her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fucks , " men who could further her career , help her with her portfolio o shares ( an impressive collection ) , assist her with real estate ( three house in Beverly Hills and an office block ) , and generally advise her on evematter from tax to abortion . Gina always went to the best and never paid . Her current lovers include a Spanish real estate mogul , a Brazilian business whiz , a very rich Ara ( he took care of her jewelry  --  that is , he shopped Fred and Tiffany 's every time he was in town ) , and the best lawyer , accountant , and gynecologistin Beverly Hills . What she really wanted was a senator in her life , but she had yet to meet Teddy Kennedy , whose fame attracted her the way plump skin attracts a hungry mosquito . She looked upon Neil Gray as the next step in her career . He could treat her as badly as he wanted . For he would pay . One way or another . She would make sure of that. 110Neil looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Surprise ! I thought we could talk on the way home . " He glanced behind him . Thank God he had insisted on walking ahead of Gina . Quickly he grabbed her arm and said , " Wonderful , darling . You 're just what I need after a weekend of Pamela and George . " Briskly be hurried her from the terminal . " Well ? " she questioned . " I ca n't wait . Do we or do we not have the great George Lancaster ? " " You 'll never believe this , " he said , hurriedly walking toward the opendooredlimo where a chauffeur stood in uniformed attendance . " But I , till do n't know . " " Hey ? " Buddy questioned . " You really get off on that stuff ? " Shelly snorted a thin line of white powder from a mirrored tabletop through a folded banknote . " Sure . Does n't everybody ? " " Yeah . In Hollywood , I guess . " He prowled uneasily around her messyapartment . " I used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag . " " A drag , " she repeated and grinned . " You got broke and could n't afford habit . Right ? " " You know something ? " He picked up a folder of photographs and irked idly through them . " You have one smart mouth . " She greedily snorted a touch more coke . " So I 've been told Mister Married . " " Did your memory get jogged yet ? " he asked . She stretched lazily . " In a hurry ? " Yeah . He was in a hurry . He wanted to get back to Angel . " No hurry . " " Then relax . Take off your pants . " She yawned . " If you like I 'll giveyou a blow job that 'll blow your mind . " She laughed . " Get it ? " He sighed . " Shelly , Shelly , who are you tryin ' to turn on ? There'sonly you an ' me here , an ' I think we got each other tagged . " " You 're right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I give the best head intown . A hundred guys have told me . And you know what , pal . I 'm goodhecause I enjoy it  --  love it . " She laughed again . " Sure you do n't want1.1 give me a fast audition ? " " Quite sure , thank you . " There was something about her that reminded him of himself before he met Angel . A real smart-ass . Master of the fast line and the quick come-on . " Well . . . " She rose and pulled at the tie on her wrapover skirt . " I guess if you 're sure . " The skirt fell to the floor , and very slowly she111hooked her fingers into the top of her leotard and peeled it down . " Hey , " he said quickly . " Enough . You sound like a hooker . " " Takes one to know one , " she taunted , stepping out of her leotard altogether . He frowned . " Have we met before ? " " Ah ha ! You remembered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nakedness . He backed away . " I 'm going home . " " Do n't you want to know where we met ? " " I 'm not losin ' sleep over it . " " Ah , Buddy . Let me give you head . C'm on , huh ? I 'm askin ' nicely . " He had backed himself all the way to the door . Slipping the latch , he let himself out . " See you by the pool , kid . Do n't catch cold . " She waved her tongue at him obscenely . " Street People is the nam of the movie Jer is up for . Oliver Easterne 's the producer . Give it a shot . " " Hey  --  all right . I will . " He took the stairs two at a time . Thirty second later he was fitting his key into the front door and calling out , " Angel babe . I 'm home . " " I just do n't believe the bastard would n't give you a yes or a no . Th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . " " I 'm well aware of that , " Neil replied caustically . He and Montana lounged on top of their king-size bed . She wore hug- reading glasses and a man 's shirt , her long legs stretched out before her while her heavy black hair hung in a straight curtain to her waist . Neil , in his pajamas , looked tired and haggard . Two solid days of Gin : Germaine would make anyone exhausted . Even a Warren Beatty or Ryan O'Neal might feel the pace . Gina liked to fuck . Correction . Nei could n't make up his mind whether she liked to fuck or fucked to b liked . Interesting problem . Not his . He wanted her for one thing and on thing only . " Stars ! " Montana exclaimed scornfully . " They 're all a giant pain . " Sh reached for a Salem and lit up . " The real reason George Lancaster won ' commit is because he thinks if he says no you 'll offer the part to someon else and his ego would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The problem is Pamela . She holds the ball in that household . " " And is she squeezing them to say yes or no ? " " I do n't think she 's quite decided .

" The lady is frightened of **25;11879;TOOLONG nymphets climbing on her old man 's bones . " He looked amused . " You 've never met Pamela , have you ? The only thing that would frighten her is if the government threatened to take away her money . " " Ca n't wait to meet her . " " You 'll like her . " " Wan na bet ? " " I never risk my money with one of life 's winners . " A smile flickered across her face , and she pushed her reading glasses up into her hair . " Such a charmer ! " " Of course . " She reached out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've got a headache . " " Neil ! That 's supposed to be my excuse . " " I really do , " he assured her . She rose from the bed and padded toward the bathroom . " I 'll get you a painkiller , " she said sympathetically . A weekend in Palm Beach with George Lancaster and Pamela London could n't have been all laughs . Neil looked worn out . She had n't really felt much like sex anyway  --  even though it had been a couple of weeks . Of course , sex with Neil was still great , but they had been together long enough not to feel the need to do it every night , and right now work was the raging passion . Besides , getting a movie off the ground was never easy , and she sensed that he was more worried than he seemed . She took two aspirin from a bottle , filled a glass with water , and walked hack into the bedroom . " So , " she said , handing him the pills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it ? " He gulped the pills down quickly , not looking at her . There was no headache , but any more physical exertion after what he had been through with Gina was quite out of the question . " George and Pamela will be here in two weeks ' time . We 'll get our answer then , " he said . Christ ! He felt so guilty . He did n't need her sympathy to make him feel worse . " Visiting royalty . What fun ! " she said lightly . " I promise , you 'll like them both . " 111 , She raised a cynical eyebrow . Angel was well aware of Buddy entering their apartment . Although it 1011 ; was almost three in the morning he made no effort to be quiet . He slammed the door , called out her name , and switched on all the lights . She lay on her stomach in bed , silent and still . At first , when he had t4walked out on her , she had been anxious for him to return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even bother to call she had become hurt , then angry . What was it about her that invited such behavior ? Why did she always end up being treated badly ? She had spent her life apologizing for just being around . With Buddy all that was supposed to change . He was her new beginning , the start of her own family . Men : Had n't her foster mother always warned her ? " Angel ? " he whispered softly . Men : Never trust them . " Are you awake , sweet stuff ? " he asked more loudly . Men : They have dirty habits and dirty minds . He rubbed her back . " Angel , babe ? " Men : They only want One Thing . Slowly he slid his hands under the covers . Men : If you give it to them they never respect you . He pulled the covers off her immobile body . She was wearing her short blue nightie with matching panties . " You awake ? " She remained silently on her stomach , her eyes squeezed tightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the elastic of her panties and pulled them off . She said nothing . Why should she ? She was mad at him , was n't she ? He parted her legs and bent his head , his tongue darting into her warm wetness like a lethal cold snake . Why was his tongue so cold ? Why was she suddenly shaking with ecstasy ? Why could n't she stay mad at him ? " Ohhh . . . Buddy . . . " The words fluttered from her mouth like summer blossoms falling from a tree . He raised his head long enough to say , " You 're not mad at me , babe , are you ? " She sighed very very softly and murmured , " Turn the light out , Buddy . Please ... " He ripped off his pants . " Why ? You got somethin ' to hide ? " God but she made him horny ! He spread her legs wider and replaced his eager tongue with something he had been saving for her all night long. 11412Deke Andrews rode the subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used-car lots along Queens Boulevard . He finally found what he was looking for , a small brown van with tattered curtains on the back windows . It was five years old , with plenty of mileage on the clock . " How much ? " he asked the shirt-sleeved dealer . The dealer summed up his potential customer . " Price is on it , " he said finally . " I know , " Deke replied , " but you 'll never get it . " " Says who ? " " It 's not worth it . Needs work . " " How d' you know ? " " I can tell . " " You ai n't even driven it . " " I can tell . " The dealer spat a wad of chewing gum onto the ground . " I can drop a hundred . " " Three hundred . " " That 's my profit . " " Cash . " Curiosity got the better of the salesman . " Do n't you want to drive it ? " " I want to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The salesman nodded . He would have taken four hundred off , if pushed . The engine was pure garbage . Together they went into his office and did business . Fifteen minutes later Deke drove away from the lot in the van . He knew it was an inferior piece of machinery , but he also knew that115by the time he was finished with it the engine would sing . Deke had a way with cars . Joey said , " Do you have a car ? " Deke replied , " No . I did have . I had a Mustang . It was  --  " " Shee ... it ! " " What ? " " I wanted to take a ride . Atlantic City , maybe . Fun , huh ? We could make out on the beach . " " Make what ? " " Je ... sus ! Sometimes I do n't believe you . We 've been seem ' each other three weeks . Waddya think we 're gon na make ? Sand castles ? " " Sorry . I  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do that . " " I could get a car . " " How ? " " From the garage where I work . " " When ? " " I do n't know . I 'd have to wait until one came in for repairs and was left overnight . " " Shee ... it ! " " What 's the matter ? " " I wan na go for a drive tonight . " " It 's not possible . " " Then I think I 'll work . You 'd better go home . " " No ! I 'll get us a car . " " Yeah ? You sure , cowboy ? " " 1 'm sure . " He drove the van slowly and carefully . Would n't do to get stopped . He drove out past Kennedy airport , turned off the main highway , and searched for a quiet side road . There he parked and opened up the hood . The engine was no better and no worse than he had thought . A few days of hard work should do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he parked the van near the station and took the subway back to New York . His room waited . A few impersonal square feet . A bed , a dresser , his scant possessions . It took him only minutes to pack . And then , once more , he was on his way. 11613Lunch : The Bistro Gardens . Cast : Elaine Conti . Maralee Gray . Karen Lancaster . Menu : Salad , salad , salad . Nothing fattening . They were all on a permanent diet . Subject : Gossip . Karen to Maralee : " You look absolutely sensational . Palm Springs must have agreed with you . " Maralee , smiling : " It certainly did . I met this very interesting man called Randy Felix . " Elaine : " Did he live up to his name ? " Maralee : " How would I know ? It was n't that sort of relationship . " Karen , cynically : " There are no other kinds of relationships . " Maralee : " Randy is into preserving our environment . " Karen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth : " How old is he ? And does he have money ? " Maralee , laughing : " I do n't know and I do n't much care . I 'm not planning to marry him . " Elaine : " What are you planning ? " Karen : " She 's planning to get into the poor kid 's pants . When does he get into town ? " Maralee , affronted : " He 's not a kid . He 's at least twenty-six or - seven . And as a matter of fact he will be in L.A. shortly . He has his own apartment here . " Karen and Elaine in unison : " Sure . " Maralee : " God ! You are a couple of bitches . " Karen : " Nothing wrong with getting laid . " Maralee : " I never said there was . And if I do decide to investigate the117poor kid 's ' pants , I 'll certainly be sure to let you know , Karen , dear . " Karen : " Details ! I want details ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Karen ! " " Sorry , sorry . I 'll shut up . " The three women were firm friends . They moved in the same circles and shared the same interests  --  clothes , money , and sex . Also none of them had children , which created a bond  --  Karen because she did n't want any , Maralee because she had miscarried twice when married to Neil and had then given up , and Elaine because she could not conceive  --  a fact which had never bothered her or Ross . " Oh ! Will you look who just came in , " Karen said . Three sets of eyes guarded by three sets of different expensive optics studied the entrance . There , suitably clad in a white silk Ungaro dress and jacket , with Cartier daytime diamonds , stood Bibi Sutton . Now Bibi was fifty years old if she was a day . But in the twenty years she had been one of the so-called social lionesses of the Beverly Hills elite she had not aged a jot . Her skin was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her figure voluptuous , without one inch of fat . It was said she had been a journalist in her native France and had been sent to interview the American movie star Adam Sutton at his hotel in Paris . It had also been said that she was a highly paid call girl who had visited him every night in his suite at the Georges V. For free . Who cared ? It had happened years before  --  and whatever she had been , she was now a lady to be reckoned with . Bibi Sutton set trends . She could make or break a designer , a restaurant , an artist , a caterer . If Bibi put the seal of approval on something or someone , that business or person was made . She had clout , style , and a forceful personality . Plus a French accent which even after twenty years sounded like Bardot on a bad day . She cultivated broken English ; it was part of her charisma . In comparison , Adam Sutton was a tall , quiet-spoken man . A fine actor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an upstanding member of the Los Angeles community . They had two children , a girl of eighteen , studying at a college in Boston , and a boy of nineteen , away at Harvard . Rumor had it that there was another child born to Bibi before her marriage  --  the result of a torrid , affair with George Lancaster . But Bibi had always denied it . " A filthy lie , " she told the one journalist brave ( or stupid ) enough to ask her . And the rumor was laid to rest . Bibi and Adam Sutton were Hollywood royalty . The perfect couple . Rich . Socially acceptable . Powerful. 118 " Hmmm ... " murmured Karen . " How I 'd love to catch our Bibi with ' her pantyhose around her ankles . " She had always been amused at the thought of her father and Bibi locked in hot combat all those years ago . Maralee licked her lips . " And how I 'd love to catch our Adam in bed one dark night . Preferably with me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be joking . He has to  --  the most boring lay in Beverly Hills . " " Who would know ? " Maralee retorted tartly . " I would n't for one , " Karen replied . " In fact I ca n't think of anyone who would . The man does not screw around . " " How unusual , " Maralee said . Elaine ignored them both . She was on her feet and heading full-speed In Bibi 's direction . " Darling ! " Both together . Kissy , kissy on each other 's cheeks . Lips not touching skin . " How are you ? " Still together . " You look wonderful . " The ritual was over . " Bibi , " Elaine said quickly , " I 'm thinking of hiving a little soiree on the twenty-fourth of this month . It 's a Friday . Nothing vast . But it 's been such ages since I 've had time to get anything together . Ross has been so busy . My God  --  I do n't have to tell you what u 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweetie ! " Bibi looked quite shocked . " Eh ! How I know ? You think I know anything without my book ? You call me . We l000ve to come if On free . Okay , sweetie ? " " Yes , fine , I 'll call you later , " Elaine said obediently . It would be unthinkable to plan a party on a date when the Suttons could not attend . Quickly she returned to her table in the fashionable sunlit garden . 1 " Any luck ? " demanded Karen , who knew every move . " I have to call her later , " Elaine replied sulkily . " She does n't know a ng without her book . " " Horseshit , " said Karen succinctly . " She never commits to anythingss she 's certain there is nothing better going on that night . Years agofather had a birthday party for her , and she bowed out at the last nute to go to some half-assed dinner for Khrushchev . Daddy was rious . " " I bet , " agreed Maralee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she still would n't invite Daddy to her house because he once led to turn up at one of her special dinners . " Elaine stared at her two friends . Sometimes she got an uncomfortably In cure feeling when she was around them . They were so sure of themselves . And so they should be . They had both grown up in Beverly Hills with rich , famous fathers behind them , always had money , and whoever they were married to would always be accepted . It was their birthright . Little Etta Grodinski from the Bronx had had to struggle for everything . Marrying a movie star , landing up in a Beverly Hills mansion , and becoming attractive , clever Elaine Conti had been no easy job . Moodily she sipped her white wine . Think yourself lucky . These women are your friends . They accept you . They like you . They tell you about their lives and loves , their clothes and makeup , their plastic surgeons and gynecologists . You 're one of them now . You are . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she hid her background . Her parents , still alive , had long ago moved from the Bronx to a pleasant house on Long Island . To this day she had never invited them to visit her in Beverly Hills . To this day they had never met Ross . She phoned them once a week , and sent them a monthly check . They were nice simple people . They would never be comfortable in her world . You 're ashamed of them , Elaine . I 'm not , I 'm not . " Look who Bibi 's with , " said Karen . All eyes swiveled to inspect Bibi 's companion , who had arrived laand was now hurrying across the crowded restaurant to join her . " It 's only Wolfie Schweicker , " Maralee said dismissively . " My God ! For a moment I thought it was a man ! " exclaimed Karen " He looks different . What has he done ? " " Lost about forty pounds , " said Elaine , joining in . " So he has , " marveled Karen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Professional walker . The term was used fo any affluent , well-connected man who escorted married ladies when their husbands were not available to accompany them to the various openings and galleries and restaurants where they simply had to be seen . Nancy Reagan had hers . Wolfie was Bibi 's equivalent . Once grossly fat , he had managed to slim down to merely chubby . He was round of face , short of leg , and expensively clad in the best Gucci had to offer . He was in his early fifties , and owned a very successful chain of designer bathroom shops with franchises across America . Everyone adored Wolfie . He was so witty . But he belonged to Bibi Sutton and never strayed . " Do you know , " Maralee said , tapping her perfect fingernails on the tabletop , " I once invited Wolfie to a brunch . Without taking a breath he asked if Bibi and Adam were coming . I was married to Neil at the time , he loathed Bibi , and did n't care who knew it . Called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the memory . " Anyway , I said no , and he said no . Can you imagine ? Would n't even come to a tiny little brunch without her . " The lunch passed in a flurry of gossip , innuendo , and general bitchery. 120Reputations , love affairs , talent , and looks were casually pulled to pieces . Elaine asked for the check and charged it to her American Express card. i Karen hurried off to her analyst , and Elaine and Maralee strolled outside to get their respective cars from an attentive parking valet . Maralee raised her sunglasses , peered conspiratorially at her friend , and said , " Well , what do you think ? " Elaine cast a professional eye on Maralee 's recent surgery . She had not been married to a plastic surgeon without learning a thing or two . " Excellent , " she declared , after a thorough inspection . " Really a firstclassjob . " Maralee was thrilled . " Honestly ? " " Would I lie ? " " Of course you would n't ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carrera . She grabbed every cent of alimony she could from Neil , but actually did n't need a dime . Her father had settled two trusts on her , both of which she had gained possession of . When Tyrone Sanderson died she stood to inherit another fortune . " I 'm going to Neiman-Marcus , " she announced . " Why do n't you come ? " Elaine shook her head . " I have to get home . Now that Ross is back my time 's not my own . " Maralee nodded understandingly and headed for her car . " By the way . " Elaine placed a restraining hand on her friend 's arm . " There 's something I 'd like you to do for me . " " Yes ? " " Look , I know you 're not on the greatest of terms with Neil . " " That 's the understatement of the year ! " " But could you . . . would you . . . " Maralee was getting impatient . " What , Elaine ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly . " It 's important . I need it immediately . " Maralee raised her eyebrows . " That piece of trash ! " " Have you read it ? " " Do I need to ? Montana supposedly wrote it . Does n't that tell you enough ? " Elaine felt a flush spreading across her face . How she hated having to ask anyone for anything . " Can you get it for me ? " Maralee gazed at her friend shrewdly . " Do n't tell me Ross is inter-ested ? " Elaine shrugged in what she hoped was a noncommittal fashion . " He likes to see everything . " " Ca n't his agent get him a copy ? " 121 " Apparently it 's under wraps . " " Probably because it 's so bad , " Maralee sniffed . " Oh , well , if you want it , it 's yours . There 's nothing in this town that I ca n't get my hands on . " " Thanks , Maralee . " " It 's nothing . " Lips brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maralee roared off in her new Porsche , and Elaine climbed disconsolately into her four-year-old Mercedes . It would all change  --  soon . The Contis would be back on top and she would never have to ask anyone a favor again . " I just left your wife , " Karen husked over the phone . " So ? " " I told her everything . " There was a long pause while Ross digested this information . " You did what ? " he said at last . Karen 's voice was filled with emotion . " Everything , Ross . I think she 'll probably kill you ! " She could hold back her laughter no longer . " Clever cunt . " " You said it ! " " Where are you ? " " In my analyst 's waiting room . I 'm just about to tell him all about us . " " Do n't ! " " Why not ? I 'll tell you what he says . I promise . " " Dammit , Karen , do not mention my name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't ? " " The biggest dick you 've ever seen . " She chuckled happily . " I would n't be too sure of that . " " I 'll call you tomorrow . " " Not good enough . When ? " He wanted her , but he wanted the script of Street People more , and he did not plan to leave the house until he had it . " I said I 'll call you tomorrow . " She was not prepared to be so easily dismissed . " I understand it 's going to be party time in the Conti household soon . " " Yup . " " Elaine spent the entire lunch yearning after Bibi Sutton . " " Did she get her ? " " She got a maybe . You know Bibi . " Ross understood the social mores of Beverly Hills . If Elaine could not 122get Bibi Sutton to their party she might as well not bother giving it . Maybe he would give Adam a call , pull the old-pals act . " I have to go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get off the phone before he did . " Do n't you dare mention my name to your analyst , " he warned . She hung up without another word . Ross returned to the lounger where he was carefully taking the sun and imagined the scene at the Bistro Gardens  --  Bibi playing hard to get , Elaine chasing , and Karen enjoying every fawning minute . Karen . For one wild second he had actually believed her when she 'd said she 'd told Elaine . The broad had a wicked sense of humor . Maybe he should dump her . But why ? She would never open her mouth to Elaine , and he certainly wanted more of her horny body and wonderfully erotic nipples . Oh , those nipples ! More  --  but not immediately . When he 'd seen the script of Street i'eople . When Sadie La Salle was his agent . When he felt more ... settled . It seemed to Buddy that he had hardly closed his eyes when the phone woke him . " Whoozatt ? " he mumbled . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awake ? " " Call me in the mornin ' , " he said sleepily . " It is morning , " replied his caller testily . " It 's eleven o'clock and about time you moved it . " " Randy ! " Slowly he opened an eye . " How 're you doin ? " " Doin ' more than all right . I found me a real hot rich one . " " Hey  --  tit 's good . " He opened the other eye and groped around the bed looking for Angel . She was not there . " Yeah , " said Randy briskly . " And no way do I aim to blow the opportunity . Like so far I am Mr. Straight , an ' she goes for me a lot  --  and with a great deal more input I think I can find myself really on the right track . " " Good , good ... " mumbled Buddy , hoping the call had nothing to do with the apartment . " I 'm driving in tomorrow , " Randy said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll need my apartment . I know it 's short notice an ' all . But when I lent you the place we did agree it was only for a couple of weeks , an ' well  --  you been there awhile . I 'll be arriving around noon tomorrow . " " Noon ? " ir " Right . " Buddy struggled for something to say . What could he say ? Hey , man . I got nowhere else to go . I got no money . I got a wife to support . I got nothing . He could n't say that . No way could he say that . Pride . He had enough not to admit that in the time he 'd been back he had not scored one lousy stinking job . " We 'll be long gone by then , " he said cheerfully . " And thanks for the loan of the place , Rand . S'matter of fact we 'll be movin ' into Sunset Towers . " " Sunset Towers , huh ? Everything 's goin ' your way , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't wait to meet your old lady . " " We 'll call you in a week an ' get it together . " He banged the phone down and leaped from the bed . Shit ! He stormed the refrigerator , gulped orange juice from a carton , grabbed a handful of raisins , and bit into an apple . Then he thought about what he could do . Gladrags . No longer in business . Maxie Sholto . Had to be the last resort . Frances Cavendish . Call her right away about Street People . Shelly . What did it take to become a male stripper ? He pulled on his shorts and automatically started in on some push- ups . Then he remembered Gladrags ' roomate , the plump little fag with the horny dog who had thrust his card at him and said , " Call me . " So why not ? Find out the score . Yeah . But where was the guy 's card ? What had he done with it ? He tried to concentrate on his push-ups , but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were about to find yourself out on the street ? Abruptly he jumped to his feet and punched out Frances Cavendish ' number on the phone . " Miz Cavendish is in a meeting . Can she call you back ? " droned . i unfamiliar voice . " It 's urgent business , " he snapped . " Oh . Well , I 'll see . Who shall I say is calling ? " " Robert Evans . " Respect . " Yes , Mr. Evans . " A thirty-second wait , then , " Bobby , how are you ? And what can I dh for you ? " " Frances , this is Buddy Hudson , and do n't get mad at me , this ' urgent . " 124 " Jesus Christ ! " He spoke rapidly . " Frances , there 's a movie called Street People . There 's a part in it for me . You want to create another star ? Then just end me up for it , okay ? " Frances was more than exasperated . " Not okay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is indeed a movie of that name being cast . But whether there is a role in it suitable for you , I do not know , because have not seen the script . Indeed , very few people have seen the script . ' s under wraps . " " That 's crap , Frances . You see everything . " She made a sound like an angry horse . " Very true , Buddy , dear . owever , on this occasion all casting is being taken care of by the writer , " and her voice filled with scorn , " who obviously knows better than all of us poor old experts . I have only been in the business thirty years , that 's I. What could I possibly know ? " " Who is the writer ? " " Montana Gray , the director 's wife . Does that tell you enough ? Now t off this line , Buddy , and do n't ever use a phony name to get through me again . Do you understand ? " " I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always need a job , but you never get any I send you r . " You got something for me ? Next time 'll be my shot . I know it . " He  --  uld feel her thinking , and he willed her to come up with an interview . " Are you interested in work as an extra ? " she said at last . Anger flooded through him . Extra work . He 'd sooner leave town than ) p to that . " No , " he said coldly . " Sorry . Then I ca n't help you right now . " How he hated the phone . First Randy , then Frances . Always bad news . The sound of Angel 's key in the door , and what was he going to tellShe looked particularly beautiful , shining with a very special inno-  --  nce . " I 'm sorry I was n't here to fix your breakfast , " she murmured softly , ing to him and putting her arms around his waist . " I had to visit the  --  tor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife of Neil Gray , the director . asting the movie themselves . An Oliver Easteme production , Shelly d said . He gave Angel a gentle shove . " Call information for me , babes . I m ed the number of Easterne Productions . " She stared at him with a hurt expression . " I said I had to go see the doctor . Do n't you want to know why ? " " Yeah , sure , ' course I do . " And then as an afterthought , " Why did n't you tell me you were going ? " " I . . . I was n't sure you 'd be pleased . " She gazed at him , the happine in her eyes shadowed by uncertainty . " But now that it 's confirmed . . . " The horror of what she was about to say struck him . " Christ , ba You 're not  --  " He could n't bring himself to finish the sentence . She nodded and whispered the missing word . " Pregnant . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wonderful , Buddy ? Is n't it absolutely wonderful ? " He did n't know what to say . A choking feeling overtook him . wanted to push her away , but controlled himself . " Hey  --  I got ta swim , I 'm runnin ' late . I 'll be back . " He rushed fro the apartment like a thief . " Buddy  --  " she called after him , but he did n't stop . She closed her eyes for a moment , squeezed them tightly shut , de mined not to cry . Oh boy . . . it sure was n't the way it was in the movie but she had to stop feeling sorry for herself . If Buddy was n't happy abo the baby , that was just too bad . She was thrilled . And eventually he wou be too . She was sure of it . After all , he loved her , did n't he ? And would make them into a real family . IA ICaptain Lacoste said , " You want it , take it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you know we 've done everything we can .

He left the ' swain 's office and went straight outside to his car . It was raining. 1 con was annoyed about losing his raincoat . It was the genuine English a  --  le , purchased by a good friend at Burberry 's in London , and brought k as a special birthday present .

Half asleep , he groped his way to thet door , glancing at his watch on the way and wondering who the hellbothering him at two in the morning . He threw open the door and was confronted with a sorry sight . Joey vetz stood there soaked to the skin . Her T-shirt stuck transparently her body , her baggy trousers clung damply , her orange hair was tened to her scalp , and water dripped off the end of her crooked snub e. rl brought back your raincoat , " she said forlornly , handing it to him . e was pleased to see his raincoat , not pleased to see her . " How did know where I lived ? " She fished a crumpled envelope from his raincoat pocket . " Your electric , " she stated , then immediately began to sneeze . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gee , thanks , " she sneered . " Thought you 'd never ask . " And then a n spread across her face . " Nice pajamas . Real sexy . I like the peep-He was mortified to find his fly gaping open . " Just a minute , " he saidy , and hurried to the bathroom , where he threw on a bathrobe . When returned to the living room she was standing by the television set pping all over his carpet . " Look , " he said testily . " I 'll give you something to put on while your he s dry . Then I 'll call you a cab . " 1 do n't have nowhere to go , " she whined. here must be somewhere . " " No , " she said stubbornly . " So we 're back to dropping you at Juvenile then . " 127Her attitude quickly changed . " Aw , shit ! " she snarled . " You goti record playin ' in your mouth .

" My girlfriend gets back tomorra . I ' stayin ' at her place ' til I get the bread together for Arizona . " A few mol sneezes rendered her speechless . " Will you go into the bathroom and get those wet clothes off befog you catch pneumonia ? " She nodded obediently . He directed her while trying to figure out wht to do with her . " Can I take a shower ? " she called out . " I suppose so , " he replied ungraciously . " Throw me out your clothes I 'll try and get them dry . " He went in the kitchen and switched on the electric kettle , then h picked up her clothes from the floor and placed them on a radiator . Afte that he brought a baggy sweater and some old trousers from his close and dropped them outside the door ready for her to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with a sixteen-year-old hook showering in his bathroom ? Christ . This would make him a laughingst if anyone down at the precinct ever found out . She emerged dry and clean , ridiculously swamped by his clothes . water was boiling , so he poured some in a cup , added a teabag and sugar cubes , and handed it to her . She sat herself down at the kitchen table and sipped it gratefully . " And what exactly am I supposed to do with you ? " he said . " Let me sleep on your couch an ' I 'll be outta here first thing inmornin ' , " she replied , quick as a flash . " I ca n't do that . " " Why not ? " He thought for a moment . The only alternative was to turn her in , ar that meant getting dressed and dragging over to the station . It was sti pouring , the poor kid would get locked in a cell until morning , and d paperwork alone ... He made a quick decision . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the morning he would take her to her friend just to make sure s was telling the truth . Somewhere in the back of his head a warning you said , " Wrong , " but he ignored it , got spare blankets and a pillow fro the hall closet , and left her to it . He closed his bedroom door , got into bed , read two chapters of Joseph Wambaugh novel , and fell asleep. 128The storm hit around three-thirty . Wild forks of lightning and deep rumbles of thunder . Leon slept . Nothing disturbed him . Joey woke immediately , hugged the blanket around her nakedness , and began to shiver . The brilliant flashes of lightning and the heavy thunder petrified her . She leaped from the couch and rushed into Leon 's bedroom . He slept on his back , snoring , oblivious to everything . Quietly she lifted the cover and crawled in beside him . He did n't stir . She snuggled close , and his bulk comforted her . He moved in his sleep , groaned , muttered something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , fitting herself spoonlike into the curve of his back , her hands moving around to his chest . He was still , his breathing heavy . She searched his chest , thick with curly hair , until she located his nipples . Experience had told her that men could get just as turned on by nipple play as women . She found one , then the other , and the tips of her stubby little fingers went to work . His nipples soon hardened beneath her touch . She moved her hands down , found the opening in his pajama pants , slid her hands within , and grasped his swollen penis . Very gently she began to manipulate it up and down . Slow rhythmic motions that 1caused a low moan of pleasure to escape his lips , although he remained asleep . She grinned , the storm forgotten , while she concentrated on bringing him to a climax without waking him . " You got a beautiful johnnie there , " she whispered encouragingly in his ear . " A real humdinger .... Come on , cowboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mama ... give me all that juicy jism .. . Oh , she knew what they liked to hear , all right . And it was so easy . Ile came quickly , his sperm pulsating in long throbbing spurts onto the sheets . She snuggled closer to his back and drifted off to sleep . When she woke , dawn was breaking and the storm was long gone . Leon snored contentedly beside her . And why not ? She had given him what he wanted . What all men wanted . He might have come on with that phony fatherly concerned act , but he was only a man after all . He did n't really care what happened to her . Carefully , she wriggled from the bed and with one eye on his inert form checked out his wallet lying on the dresser . Pay dirt . He was carrying three hundred and nineteen bucks . Impulsively she grabbed the money , collected her clothes from the kitchen , flung them on , and silently crept from the apartment.  --  s s129Millie Rosemont cursed the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . Every night , for two and a half weeks , he had shut himself away in his cramped study , the offendin file laid out in sections on his desk . There he sat , for hours on end , scribbling nothing much on his precious legal pad ( she checked the basket every morning and found page after page of cryptic Why ? Where is he now ? When will he strike again ? ) Millie decided the time had come to have it out . She entered his study carrying a cup of coffee and a sandwich . " Leon , " she said sharply . " May I speak to you for a moment ? " He removed his heavy reading glasses , rubbed the bridge of his thick nose , and looked up . " If you ca n't I do n't know who can . " She placed his coffee and sandwich on the desk and stared at him gravely . " This case is becoming an obsession with you , and I do n't think I like it much . " He regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be better if he could explain things , tell her why he felt so personally involved . But no , he could n't do that . He was ashamed , embarrassed . He stretched , feeling the strain in his shoulders , the tightness around his neck . " If you do n't want me to continue ... " She made a helpless gesture with her hands . " It 's not what I want or do n't want . It 's what 's best for you . " " What 's best for me , " he said slowly , " is solving this case . " " What do you mean  --  solving it ? " she replied angrily . " It 's no secret who did the murders . You know the son did it . And you also know that he 'll be picked up for something else . It always happens that way  --  you told me so yourself . " He sipped the hot coffee . " I want to know why , Millie . I have to know . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . And not a very healthy one . " She looked at him for a long moment , then turned and left the room . He took another bite of sandwich , a sip of coffee , then picked up his pad . Where was Deke Andrews born ? he wrote . What hospital ? What city ? What date ? It was probably unimportant , but still . Among the Andrews papers had been no documents that related to their lives before they had arrived in Philadelphia over twenty years before . No wedding license , no birth certificates , no relatives ' letters , no indication of where they had come from. 130This bothered Leon . Why no record of their past ? Were they running from something or someone ? Had Deke found out something he should n't ? It was a thought . In a neat script Leon wrote : Get a computer check on Willis and Winifred Andrews . Why not ? There was nothing to lose. 15 IIIle looked the best he could  --  and that was something . The girl on reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the typed.t in front of her . She directed him to the elevator with a glowing smiled a " Lots of luck . " Luck . He needed it . Luck . His body craved it as a junkie craves drugs . He pressed the elevator button . Floor twenty . Was twenty going to be to hot new number in his life ? There was a mirror on the side of the elevator , and he monitored his appearance yet again . You 're lookin ' good ... you 're lookin ' good ... you 're lookin ' good like a superstar should . Keep thinking that way . Keep thinking up . He stepped out of the elevator into a sea of people . They sat , they lounged against walls , they took up every inch of space , all sizes , shapes , and ages , and in the middle of the throng was a large Lucite desk manned by a businesslike-looking blond and an elderly redhead . To Buddy , forty was elderly . Unless you were talking Jane Fonda or Raquel Welch . He headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he quickly observed where the main action was . A paneled oak door . A small brass plaque . It read MONTANA GRAY. 131ILady , you are in for a treat . Buddy Boy is here . Buddy Boy has come to star in your movie . He went directly to the blonde . She had marvelous green eyes , a smoot skin , and a very bad nose job . " Buddy Hudson , " he said confidently . " Miz Gray 's expecting me . " The blonde smiled , popped on a pair of lavender reading glasses , an consulted her list . Knowing that she was n't going to find his name on it , he added quickly , " Bob Evans arranged my appointment personally . " The blonde stopped reading . " He did ? With whom ? " " Uh , he spoke to Montana  --  Miz Gray . She said for me to come right over . I 'm working on a special at NBC and I have "  --  he glanced at his watch  --  " exactly forty-two minutes before my ass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the smile that said 1 think you are the most desirable femal I have ever seen in the whole of my life and 1 would like to fuck you brains out because you are so totally and absolutely irresistibly gorgeous " So , " he continued , " I 'd appreciate it if I could be next in . Not that I want to throw off your schedule or anything . " The blonde had hardly led a sheltered life . She had been through many men and many scenes . She considered herself a tough nut to crack . Tho smile never left her face . Buddy Hudson was something else ! She knew instinctively that he desired her , and not just because she was the gateway to Montana Gray . " I 'll see what I can do , " she said , writing down his name . His gaze was level , direct . " I 'd really appreciate that . " The first thing that struck Buddy was that she was n't his type . N way . Not at all . She sat behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jacket and pinstripe shirt . Her jet hair was scraped back into a long braid , ' and most of her face was obscured by huge , lightly tinted reading glasses . Her skin was olive-toned and glowing , her mouth wide and unrouged . No sirree . She was n't his type at all . Buddy Boy liked them soft an blond , pretty and appealing . He liked them girlish . She was busy writing something on a pad , and without looking up she indicated that he should sit . There was a leather chair opposite her des for just such a purpose . He glared at it balefully . Who needed to sit Where was the impact in that ? First impressions were very important , and when she looked up from her scribbling he wanted her to feel the full blast of his personality . He hovered near the door ready to walk toward the desk when he had132der full concentration . The walk was important . It was part of him , the fling thrusting strut . Jeez ! He was n't nervous , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the patches of damp under his arms ? And why was his per lip clouding with little beads of sweat ? Son of a bitch ! Was she going to read all day ? Up until now it had n a breeze . Who would have thought it would be that easy to lie his y in to see her ? And get in ahead of a roomful of people who probablyappointments . He could thank the blonde with the bad nose job for t little piece of luck . He wished that he knew something about the role in the movie . Should be aggressively sexual ? Boyish ? Charming ? Dustin Hoffman with ks ? Damn it . All he knew was the title of the film and that she had written and that her old man was going to direct it . His stomach was knotting up . Tension . If he carried on this way he 'd ve ulcers before he was thirty . Yeah . And why not ? Randy was throwing them out of the apartment . had no money , no job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was pregnant . He shuffled restlessly . " I wo n't be a minute , " Montana said , without looking up . I can wait . I mean , why should n't I ? I 'm only another bum actor ut a job . Why should anyone consider my feelings ? He had taken Angel 's news calmly . She was so happy  --  somehow itnot seemed the right time to tell her that she 'd have to get an abortion. way could they afford a baby . He had tried to conceal his shock . n he had dressed in his one good outfit and moved ass . Fast . ! fitting on the Easteme offices had been a snap decision , and now he as here  --  and there she was  --  Miz Montana Gray . Not his type . No ay . But quite a looker if you liked the strong ballsy type . She stuck her pen in her mouth , pushed her reading glasses up intohair , and hit him with laser-beam tiger eyes . " Buddy Hudson , " she d coolly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " She was no easy touch . He could see that . Try the honest approachgo for broke . He strutted toward her desk and kind of threw himself a chair , legs casually apart . " He did n't . " " He did n't , " she repeated patiently . " Nope . Men maybe you 'd like to tell me why you 're here ? " Smoky ebony f ' met laser tigers and held. 133 " Because , " he said slowly , with just a touch of arrogance , " you 'd have been missing out if you had n't seen me . " He favored her with a long sexy stare . She stifled impatience . " I would ? " He was brimming with false confidence . " Sure you would . " She removed the tip of her pen from between her lips . " Why do n't w0 cut out the shit , Mr. Hudson ? " " Huh ? " " Let 's cut out the **52;11906;TOOLONG and let me get a look at the real you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ca n't win ' em all . " RI- ! , " Do you have pictures ? A resume ? " " I did n't bring anything with me . " " Then why do n't you just tell me what you 've done ? " She poised pen above the notepad on her desk . Jeez ! She was interested in his acting experience . Really interested ! " I. . . uh . I 've done a Starsky and Hutch . I was in Smokey and thIBandit . Well , like I mean I was in it , but by the time it hit the screenwas n't  --  " " I think I get the picture . " " Not that I was n't good in it , " he added hurriedly . " I mean  --  hey I was very good , too good . Like it was a scene with Burt Reynol and  --  " " Yes , I understand . " He stood up and paced excitedly in front of her desk , forgetting im and impact for the moment . " I studied at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of her best students . I played Stanley Kowal in Streetcar . A special performance for talent scouts , agents , the who schmeer . I was a smash , a couple of studios wanted to sign me , but had this singing gig in Hawaii I was already committed to  --  an ' the was no way I would ever back out on a definite commitment . " He w speeding , his words tumbling out like an express train . " I 'm a professio all the way  --  you can bet on that . " " I 'm sure you are , " she murmured , watching him intently . " Yeah . . . well . . . like I came back from Hawaii straight into the r sion . Ten thousand actors an ' ten jobs , y'know ? " She nodded sympathetically . " I think I 've interviewed most of them . The buzzer on her desk sounded and she said " Yes " into the intercom " Mr. Gray on the line , " said the receptionist . " Find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 134Buddy returned to his seat in front of her desk and wondered if he 'd id too much . What did she care if he was cut out of a lousy BurtReynolds movie ? What did she care about ten thousand actors huntingkn jobs ? " Is the Starsky and Hutch worth seeing ? " she inquired crisply . Honesty had suddenly become his best policy . " I got cut out of that . Y'see  --  Paul Michael Glaser  --  " She laughed . What a laugh . Very sexy . " I know , I know . Paul Michael Glaser could n't cut the competition , ht ? " He grinned . " You got it . " " Then there 's no film we can see on you ? " He pushed his hand through his hair nervously . " Nothin ' worth lookin ' . " Buddy Boy . Mister Cool . Where was all this leading ? " I understand . " She paused . " So . . . maybe you 'd like to read for me , if I like your work we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly speak . " Test ? " " If the reading works out . Here . " She handed him a script from her k . " Take this outside . Study it for a while , then when you 're ready II my receptionist and I 'll see you again . " He stood and grabbed the script . " Hey  --  you 're not going to regret s . I 'll be great . " She nodded . " I hope so . " He hesitated by the door . " Uh  --  which part ? " She laughed aloud . " I bet you do n't even know what the film 's about . " He regained a little of his strut . " Who does ? Every casting director intown is pissed ' cause they ca n't get their hands on it . If I walked outwith this copy now I could probably make myself a few bucks . " " And maybe lose the part of Vinnie . " " Vinnie . Right on ! " He bolted from her office clutching the script . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  plus devastating rood looks and a certain vulnerability . Yes . Buddy Hudson certainly had it  --  if he could only act . Elaine lay on a sunbed , quite naked apart from small plastic eye covers . She had abandoned the Sony earphones in favor of pure undiluted thought . How to have the best party in town ? How to make it fun and exciting  --  the of party that people would talk about for days after ? I tie mix . That was the most important ingredient . However great the food , the decor , the music , it all came down to the mix . If the people were n't right then you might as well not bother . Hibi and Adam Sutton came first , of course . If you had them you were135guaranteed acceptance from most of the other guests . Since bumping into Bibi at the Bistro Gardens , Elaine had called her twice . Both times shn had been blocked by Bibi 's officious secretary , who faithfully promised Mrs. Sutton would return her calls . So far she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and back over her ! head . She had decided to obtain a light tan for her party , and the sun solarium was certainly better than sitting out in the real thing mini your skin forever . She wished that Ross would stop baking himself to deep mahogany , etching the lines even more deeply into his skin . A sharp buzzing sound , and the full-length machine automatically turned itself off . Thankfully she slipped from the clear plastic bed and studied herself in a full-length wall mirror . Every inch of her gleamed radiantly . But there was no one to admire her gloriously glowing body , and Ross probably would n't even notice . She frowned . Maybe it was about time she had some fun . But with whom ? Her choice was limited if not downright nonexistent . After dentist and the small-time actor she had definitely decided affairs we not worth the bother . And the sex had n't been up to much either . You 're spoiled , Elaine . After Ross , where would you turn ? The Co schlong is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she got him the script , . Maralee had promised . And then maybe if she got Sadie La Salle to party and she became his agent . Good God ! What kind of thinking was that ? Did she have to get husband in a good mood to lay her ? Well . . . it would certainly help . Buddy bounced out of the Easterne production building on Sunset , . he was flying . The role of Vinnie was written for him  --  no doubt abo it . He had given a dynamite reading , and the lady in the tinted glas and cowboy boots , Montana Gray ( she was n't his type , but he had admit that she was something else in the looks department ) , had saidhe was impressive . Yeah , " impressive " had been the word she 'd us , - And then , more magic words , " It looks like we 're going to have to , . you , " she had said calmly . Holy shit ! How could she stay so calm ? " Hey ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Hey ! He Hey ! " With a flourish he had grabbed her by the waist and whirled around the room . She extracted herself from his grasp and fled behind her desk , whe alarmed by his lack of control , she had started in on a whole sp-136about how it was only a test and she would be testing other actors and not to get too high on something that might only result in disappointment . Did n't she know that testing for a major role in a major movie was the best thing that had ever happened to him in his whole life ? " Who is your agent ? " she had asked . Agent ! Who had an agent ? " Uh , like I 'm kinda between agents , " he had managed . " I see . Let my secretary know where we can contact you , and you 'll he hearing from us with a date . " " When ? " " Maybe in a week or two . " " Do I get to take a script with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you the pages I 'd like you to work on . " So he was walking tall . In spite of the fact that he still had no idea where he and Angel would be spending the night . Goddam Randy . Why could n't he stay in Palm Springs with the mother- ' and-daughter act ? He needed a good agent . The fact that he was testing for Neil Gray 's film should be enough to tempt any smart agent to sign him up  --  pronto. lie would go to the biggies  --  William Morris , ICM , Sadie La Salle . His old Pontiac sitting in a no-parking zone looked like a lump of rotting tin . The first thing he would do when he scored some big bucks would be to get himself proper wheels . A Caddy , a Merc , maybe even a Rolls . No , maybe not . A Rolls was n't his image . Something sporty would suit him better . One of those Italian jobs or perhaps an imported Jaguar XJS . Now there was a car ! Jeez ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a star ! He opened up the door of the car , got in , and sat there silently buzzing with excitement . Two hours later he was down again . Somehow he had gotten the ideai that now that he was testing everything would change . His luck was on the rise , and a good gambler always followed his luck . So , accordingly , he had presented himself at the William Morris Agency expecting action , and all he had got was a " leave your name and number " from a secretary . ' The same story at ICM . And at Sadie La Salle 's office a mini-skirted monster had told him to send in a photo , a biography , and a list of his credits . Did n't the dumb bimbo recognize a new star when she saw one ? He left the office on Canon in a fury and slumped into his car , which had now collected a parking ticket . It was then that he noticed the small white card on the floor and quickly he picked it up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card , and down in the left hand corner INTERIOR137DESIGN PERSONAL SERVICE , with an address and a phone number . Buddy kicked the old car into action . Well , what did he have to lose ? It was madness , of course . He was exhausted from a weekend  --  f her company , but when Gina Germaine called , Neil Gray went running . He had looked at the whole situation very logically , decided she had to be dropped from his life , and then decided to hump her out of his system . They made love on her whorish pink quilted bed . Then she went dow on him in her whorish pink padded bathroom with the heart-shaped to in the center " Enough , " he managed to gasp when she started to pla with his limp organ yet again . " You 're never enough for me , " breathed Gina , wondering how far she could go with the dialogue . Not too far  --  Neil was smarter than most men , although once you got their pants off part of their brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they would believ it . " I 've got to go , " Neil said weakly . " Pre-production on a movie is the most important time of all , and , my lovely lady , you are causing me to neglect my responsibilities . " " I understand , " she murmured sympathetically . " But we do seem to have something special together , do n't we ? We make sparks fly . " Why did women always have to make such a big deal out of simple fucking ? " Yes , we do , " he agreed , thinking of Montana and feeling more than a twinge of guilt . The afternoon sunshine filtered through the bathroom blinds , and he suddenly felt totally ridiculous lounging on the fur-covered floor of Gina 's overdecorated bathroom . The pounding of his heart was slackening somewhat . Christ ! A session with Gina Germaine was probably equivalent to a week 's workout at the health club . He stood up . " I 'll have a shower if I may . " She was mildly turned on by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his talent . " You may have whatever you like . " She said , stretching provocatively . It was one of the most beautiful bodies in Hollywood . And she knew it . He stepped into the shower , turning the control knob until the water was bracingly cold . When he emerged , Gina had slipped a lacy bra and French knickers over her nakedness . She handed him a large bath towel . " Neil , " she murmured softly , " I have a confession . " 138 " What ? " Briskly he dried himself , feeling refreshed and ready to get hack to work . " Well . . . " She hesitated as if reluctant to proceed . " What ? " he repeated , reaching for his shorts . " When we were in Palm Beach I sneaked a copy of Street People from our suitcase and read it . " He was surprised . Gina had never struck him as a reader . " You did ? " Her voice became crisp and businesslike , all trace of hesitant dumbnessgone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you something else . The role ofNikki is perfect for me  --  so so perfect . " He was speechless . Nikki ! The innocent unspoiled beauty . The untouched-by-lifesweet young girl . Nikki ! Was Gina making some kind of obscure joke ? " You see , " she continued earnestly , " the whole of my career I 've beentypecast . Cunty dumb blondes with hearts of gold  --  and that kind of partis not the real me . " She paused for breath , then plunged on , her huge som heaving with emotion . " Neil , " she stated dramatically . " The real e is Nikki . Everyone sees Gina Germaine , the big sexy film star . Butunderneath the dazzle lurks a vulnerable girl . A child of life ! " Where , for fuck 's sake , was she getting her dialogue ? " I want to do your film , " she continued , her round blue eyes protruding alarmingly . " I have to do your film . I 'm right for it , I do n't care what anyone says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he managed , while trying to think of what say . If he was n't bedding her it would be easy  --  enough actresses had itched him for a part and he had always dealt with the situation in an nest fashion , sometimes a brutal one . " I know you 're a good ac-tress  --  " " That 's a load of garbage , " she interrupted fiercely . " You 've never n me do anything decent . " " Yes I have , " he lied . " And you 're just about to tell me that I 'm not right for Nikki ? " He chose his words carefully . " What I am about to tell you is that you are too big a star to even consider the role . " She was silent for a moment , staring at him with eyes full of resentment . He reached for the rest of his clothes and began to dress . The soonerbe was out of this conversation and out of her house the better . " I think I should tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , " said slowly . " And if that does n't convince you ... " He imagined Montana 's expression if he told her that Gina Germaine Wanted to test for the part of Nikki . The whole thing was nonsensical.
