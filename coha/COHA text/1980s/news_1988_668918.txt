Al Nipper and Mike Capel combined on a three-hitter Saturday afternoon at the Astrodome . It didn ' t matter . The Cubs aren ' t scoring runs . This time , three Houston pitchers , including one-time patsy Bob Knepper and a reliever just off the disabled list , shut them down in a 3-1 Astro victory . That gave the Cubs 7 runs in their last 46 innings over 5 games . They won two of them because San Diego was worse . " You can say ' Joe Jones , he was exceptional , he pitched a great game against us , ' " said manager Don Zimmer . " But after awhile , you begin to say , ' Well , they ' re not all Walter Johnsons . Maybe it ' s us . ' " Saturday , it was at least a little bit Knepper , who won his fifth game without a loss and , in giving up the one run in 7 1/3 innings , saw his earned run average go up to 0. 85 . This is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cubs last year . " I ' ve thrown well , and I ' ve thrown well this year against clubs that historically have given me problems , " said Knepper . " Even years I ' ve had that were good , they ' ve given me a rough time . " It looked for awhile that the Cubs would give Knepper a rough time again Saturday . Mere hours after being humbled by Nolan Ryan , they came out swinging ; Shawon Dunston and Mark Grace turned Knepper ' s first two pitches into singles . Andre Dawson got Dunston home with a sacrifice fly . It was his 1 , 000th major-league run batted in , but it was the last the Cubs would see for the day . Houston , which has been having production problems of its own , took the lead in its half of the first in a strange little rally . Gerald Young , emerging as one of the league ' s best leadoff batters , started it with a walk , and he went to third on Billy Hatcher ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trapped Young off third and ran him down . " I was caught , " said Young , who fell for Nipper ' s bluff throw to second . " It ' s a mental mistake . I ' m supposed to see him throw it before I make my move . " When Glenn Davis popped into the second out , it looked as if Nipper was out of trouble . But Kevin Bass ripped a single to right that scored Hatcher ahead of Dawson ' s throw , and Damon Berryhill , trying to cut down Doran at third , threw the ball to Rafael Palmeiro instead . Doran got tangled at third with a sprawling Vance Law , who gave him a bloody lip . Third-base umpire Dutch Rennert was more gracious , giving him home plate after charging Law with obstruction . " My face just happened to be moving in the same direction as his foot , " said a fat-lipped Doran , who wasn ' t sure there was any obstruction at all . " I tried to get up the one time and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t . " I certainly thought there was minimal contact , " Law said . " I was trying not to step on him , because he was lying face-up . I was trying to avoid him after not being able to catch the ball . " There was a third run for the Astros , and again Young was a catalyst . He tripled into the left-field corner leading off , eventually coming in on Doran ' s chopper to Manny Trillo behind second base . Houston would have only one more baserunner , on Davis ' walk in the third . But the Cubs could do nothing with Knepper , who wore out in the eighth , and they had less luck with Larry Andersen and Dave Smith . Andersen , recovered from a muscle strain in his rib cage , hadn ' t pitched since April 23 . Smith , in his last outing , Wednesday , gave up four runs to the Mets in 1 1/3 innings . Saturday afternoon , they looked like Walter Johnson . " It ain ' t very often that you pitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , " said Zimmer , who will rest Dawson ' s knees Sunday despite a team slump that hasn ' t touched his right-fielder . But Knepper , whose fastest pitch Saturday wouldn ' t have broken the yolk on a fried egg , won ' t be around Sunday , either . " I ' m not a firm believer in speed guns , " Zimmer began , respectfully . " I don ' t believe in ' em on the big-league level . " Today , if this guy didn ' t prove my point , then I got ta be goofy . He couldn ' t have registered on a speed gun . " What he registered was win No. 5 after going 8-17 last year and enduring a spring training that featured some comments regarding umpire Pam Postema that would make even confirmed sexists want to slowly tweeze every hair in his mustache . " I think God has been gracious to me , " said Knepper . " If I ' d started the season off pitching poorly , people would be loving to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ' d be all the cheap shots in the world . " But my pitching has made that old news , and old news is no news . God has been gracious because I ' ve stood up on his word . I took a stand , and that ' s something that He ' s honored . " And the Cubs thought it was just his forkball.
