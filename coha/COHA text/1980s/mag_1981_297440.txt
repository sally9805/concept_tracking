In acronym-awed Washington , stirring up the alphabet soup is a serious matter . Thus it has become a critical concern in the capital that White House officials have begun referring to certain ongoing negotiations with the Soviet Union not as a continuation of SALT ( which stands for Strategic Arms Limitation Talks ) but as START ( for Strategic Arms Reduction Talks ) . <P> SALT was first coined as an acronym in 1968 by State Department Official Robert Martin . Senior officials at State thought it a bit too cute , but the then trendy CIA and the media picked it up , and the designation stuck . At his first press conference in January , however , President Reagan noted that " SALT means Strategic Arms Limitation , but . . . we should start negotiating on the basis of trying to effect an actual reduction . " So National Security Adviser Richard Allen started START . Eugene Rostow , director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency ( ACDA , which rhymes roughly with actor , at least in Boston ) , used the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it currency . <P> Is START a starter ? No one knows for sure . Officials at the Department of State - abbreviated as DOS , but never called " Doss " - have taken another firm stand against creeping cuteness . They say it will take an official order for them to start saying START . The CIA is keeping its view secret . Nor is there a consensus at Rostow 's ACDA , which has a problem of its own-Congress is planning to drop " Disarmament " from its title , so a way must be found to pronounce ACA ( " Assa " does not seem right ) or have it revert to being simply a set of initials . All of which should be resolved before future high-level arms talks with the Soviets are STARTed .
