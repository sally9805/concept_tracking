A FOOL AND HIS MONEY ITCHRISTMAS BONUSES IS THE SEASON to be profitable . Not-for-profit Salvation Army Santas aside , most jolly St. Nicks work for department stores , where they are to be found inculcating selfish , acquisitive materialism in wee ones ' breasts so that the sticky-fingered beasts will nag and badger their parents into producing sales and more sales . If you want to gamble on Christmas , you might look at Mattel , the manufacturer of America 's two most famous consenting adults , Barbie and Ken . The company has George Plimpton on TV plucking the sleeves of passers-by and getting them to buy Intellivision , which they are doing in fabulous numbers . In fact , the factory ca n't produce the games fast enough , so all depends on whether enough can be cranked out before the hour when Rudolph throws the switch on his nose and starts his annual Christmas bomb-run across America . The stock has been selling around $8 a share , a far cry from the $52 it went for back in 1971 . The trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't all pure play . Mattel is a small-time conglomerate , so although the toy division is cleaning up with its hip TV game , the ice show and the publishing company are draining the profits . Grown-ups like presents , too , which brings us to the department-store industry . You would think that with times going bad this would be an investment area to stay clear of , but you are wrong-or so sayeth your Fool . In recession periods retailers do less badly than people in other lines of business . This is because many of them merchandise items like food and clothing , which people must have . Not that retail sales have been dazzling of late , but they 've been better than real estate or heavy machinery . The feeling is that this is n't going to be a jackpot Christmas , although the same predictions have been made the past several years . In fact , last year turned into an excellent Christmas , and , for this industry , Santa not only brings the toys but the bulk of the bottom-line yummies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so did retail stocks . They have n't been kicked , smashed , and battered the way others have , although even now With only one month to go in this exercise , we 're going to be cautious and sell Lexicon . We 'll deposit the net proceeds of $140,890 into Dreyfus Liquid Assets . Combined with the dividends and interest we have collected this month , we have $284,480 to work with . Our final " pick " is going to be Playboy . At $9 a share we can buy 11,000 hypothetical shares for $99,000 , with an additional $990 ( one percent ) going to our broker . In next month 's final column , we will review what has happened in the last year and a half , and see why our Si million did n't double , as we brashly hoped it would when we began the exercise . In the meantime , after 76 weeks , our portfolio looks like this : they are selling cheaply , as measured by various arcane investment criteria . If it looks like a bad Christmas ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pre-Santa sales ) , the stock prices may tumble and you can put a nice little investment under your tree . The first rule for buying shares in a retail company is to visit one of its stores . Last year I had occasion to do a little shopping in Marshall Field 's main Chicago store . Field 's has been expanding in the Pacific Northwest and Texas ? both rich ground for retailers ? and it has been paying an eight percent dividend , but my experience in the mother store soured me . I ran into several indifferent , rude , and incompetent salespersons . The store was out of a number of different sizes and variety was limited and slanted toward the slim-hipped , flat-wallet , disco types . It appears to be a company with real management problems . Another one to stay away from , regardless of dividends , is Sears . This is a corporation that no longer seems to know who it is , whom it is selling to , what it should be selling , or even what business it 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it using merchandise retailing as a springboard to sell insurance , money market funds , and stocks and bonds ? Its tools and its appliances are still the backbone of its retail business , but it is beginning to act as though corporate headquarters thinks it is too high class to sell monkey wrenches to farmers . Stores must stand for something . Blooming-dale 's does , and therefore its owners , Federated Department Stores , are a good candidate for investment , particularly if you have a little patience and tell your broker not to buy until the stock drops into the high 20s , which would be a hell of a bargain . Federated has got some problem stores , such as the Gold Circle discount chain , but it also has Bullock 's in Los Angeles and Rich 's in Atlanta , and a management team that knows how to sell everything from slippers to salad bowls . T HEY ARE N'T the only ones . Preppy has cycled back into style and no one can do preppy like Brooks Brothers , shares of which are to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at around $25 . Allied also owns places like Jordan Marsh , the dominant upscale New England merchandiser , and Bonwit Teller . The smart guys on Wall Street are partial to outfits like Allied that sell to rich people because , they figure , while you may lose your job or have your salary cut , rich people always manage to have money , even if it is raining recessions or depressions . For a stocking treat , your Fool will give you Washington 's Woodward &; Loth rop or Philadelphia 's Strawbridge &; Clothier , worthwhile in and of themselves . But there is another reason to pop for a few shares . There have been mumbles lately that they are takeover candidates . Someone may come along soon to buy them , thereby driving up the numbers on your bottom line higher than Donner and Blitzen are going to carry the jolly old fellow in the red felt costume . It is worth repeating , however , that you should wait until a definite buying pattern has established itself . Department store stocks are not going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are bad . The chances of that happening this yuletide are much better than last . That **51;2733;TOOLONG psychology is petering out . More people are coming to suspect that inflation is abating and it is safe to save money again . Note how homeowners have stopped their tasteless crowing about how much more their house is worth than it was when they bought it . That $100,000-ranch type is now worth $90,000 or less , as are a lot of other once surefire collectibles . Diamonds are only a girl 's best friend if she is a stereotypic dumb blonde . P EOPLE ARE also confused , which make them cautious about spending . For the longest time they were told that things would get better if inflation went down . No sooner did that happen than interest rates went up , and then they were told those would have to come down , too , before the good times returned . Now the unemployment rates are going up and people know what that can lead to ? an out-and-out , old-fashioned money shortage . All of this may add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but small lumps , not enough to make coal company stocks interesting just yet . FOOL 'S GOLD : If you still own those 300 shares of RCA that Aunt Tillie left you , honor her memory by selling them ? fast . This is a company that ca n't do anything right except pay 0 . J. Simpson good money to run , skip , fly , and jump through airports on behalf of their increasingly noncompetitive Hertz subsidiary . RCA 's videodisc player is a Christmas turkey . For the greedy and venturesome , the A. H. Belo Corporation , owners of the Dallas Morning News , is worth a look-see . Belo has three TV stations and two radio stations . It has virtually no debt and it is going public , meaning that it has been owned by a group of families that did not permit its stock to be sold outside its circle . The News leads its afternoon rival in circulation . The competition is intense ; the p.m. paper is owned by the Los Angeles Times conglomerate whose management talent must be spread thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colorado , and also in Connecticut , where the corporation also owns properties . In Chicago , you and Christie Hefner will spend the holidays watching the frost form on the cotton-tailed bunnies . Playboy is limping along at about even . Its hotels are bleeding red ink , and after having the licenses to its English gambling casinos attacked , it has been forced to sell its only truly profitable properties at a punishing discount . The latest is that New Jersey officials may prevent Playboy from opening in Atlantic City as a result of the infractions against British gaming laws . At the moment the company has a good chunk of cash , but no good business ideas . In recent days the stock has been selling for as low as $6.50 a share . Congratulate yourself ? you are n't one of the sagacious investors who bought it at $32 . But there is hope in the executive suite at the Michigan Avenue rabbit hutch headquarters . The Hefners are trying to swing a deal with Klaus International , a North Pole retailer , to abandon old-fashioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team of svelte 1982 model bunnies . The lead rodents in the hitch are named Donna and Blitzie . Recessions and Christmas-time both tend to make families huddle together , and that means a second look at the Golden Arches . McDonald 's , more than any of the other fast-fooders , has been struggling to keep prices down , a task made easier by low beef prices and by the development of a cheap pork item . It will probably be called something like McRib . The company continues to make a big pitch toward kids and family , not only through its public relations and advertising , but by putting in " McDonaldland Parks " for the non-adult set and testing out gimmicks like miniature golf courses to go along with the hamburgers . In slump periods , getting food and entertainment for the price of food is a bargain , and , though the whole topic may make the good people at the Rodale Press retch , this is an age when scads of people no longer know how to cook . So it is the Golden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been bouncing around from the low 40s a share to the low 70s . Wait and do n't pay much more than $60 for it .
