The single-engine Mooney-252 touched down smoothly at Le Bourget airport , and the smiling pilot hopped off the two pillows that had elevated him high enough to peer out the plane 's window . He turned down a glass of champagne and took a Coke instead . Landing at the same field where Charles Lindbergh ended his solo flight in 1927 , U.S. Aviator Christopher Lee Marshall , all of eleven years old , had just become the youngest pilot to fly across the Atlantic . <P> While his friends in Oceano , Calif. , have been zooming about on bikes and surfboards , Marshall has been taking flying lessons since he was seven . His copilot last week was retired U.S. Navy Flyer Randy ( " Duke " ) Cunningham , 46 . A third passenger slipped on board : Marshall 's brown teddy bear , named , appropriately enough , Charles Lindbeargh.
