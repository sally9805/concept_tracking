The identity of the financial community 's latest fallen wizard , Boyd Jefferies , may have come as less than a rude shock , since the prominent Los Angeles stock trader was known to have dealt heavily with Arbitrager Ivan Boesky . But on Wall Street , where scandal is becoming almost routine , Jefferies ' announcement last week that he would plead guilty to two criminal charges created a whole new sense of dread . For Jefferies was not charged with insider trading , as a dozen others were , but with other rule-bending practices that have become commonly tolerated . The case against Jefferies , based partly on tips provided by the chastened Boesky , demonstrated that the insider- trading scandal is leading Government investigators to a wider range of illicit stock schemes . <P> .

The New York Times , quoting lawyers close to the investigation , reported that Jefferies bought the stock at the request of Salim Lewis , a financier who has had business dealings with American Express chairman James Robinson . The SEC issued subpoenas to American Express and the two investment firms that managed the offering , Shearson Lehman Bros. , which is an American Express subsidiary , and Salomon Brothers . None were accused of any wrongdoing . Robinson told TIME that he had also been subpoenaed personally , but said , " I absolutely and unequivocally deny any wrongdoing by me and , as far as we know , by anyone at American Express .
