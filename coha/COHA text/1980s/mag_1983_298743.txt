Sharing the work in France <P> French President Francois Mitterrand 's plan to cut his country 's unemployment rate seemed engagingly simple . If employees worked fewer hours , jobs could be spread among more people . Mitterrand 's Socialist administration has thus pared France 's 40-hour work week to 39 hours since taking office more than two years ago , and it plans to trim it to 35 hours by 1985 . The government has also given the French a fifth week of annual vacation and has lowered the legal retirement age to 60 for workers who have labored 371/2 years . <P> So far , however , the work-sharing scheme has fallen well short of expectations . Although planners had predicted the moves would quickly create 70,000 jobs , an independent study released in May put the actual number of new positions at between 15,000 and 30,000 . " We found that there is a very weak link between the reduction in the work week and increased employment , " said Economist Olivier Marchand , one of three authors of the study . Some two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single new worker since the work week was shortened . Meanwhile , the French unemployment rate has risen from 7.2% when the Socialists came to power in May 1981 to 8.3% in July . <P> The study contends that French workers have foiled the plan by refusing to take pay cuts to go with the shorter hours . That has left companies without new funds to hire additional people . Some European observers argue that such an outcome should have been expected . Says P.O. Klandermans , a social psychologist at Amsterdam 's Free University : " Employees may take wage cuts to avoid layoffs , but that is maintaining existing jobs , not creating new ones . I 've never heard workers say that they were willing to take home less pay to create new jobs for someone else . " <P> The work-sharing plan may actually be worsening France 's economic problems . One official estimate indicates that the measures lowered France 's 1982 growth rate by .2% , to 1.7% , and accounted for .6% of its 11.9% inflation . Peugeot , the country 's second largest automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blames the reduction in hours for some of that deficit . Peugeot said the scheme added $200 million to its labor bill last year , because the company has been getting less work performed even though wages went up some 11% . <P> Other countries are closely monitoring the French plan . Belgium , The Netherlands and Italy have launched similar attacks on unemployment . " Everyone in Europe is watching France as a pioneer in work sharing , " says Susan Binns , an official with the European Community in Brussels . " The French have gone farther and faster than anyone else . " <P> Work sharing , however , seems so far to be more successful in the U.S. , where it is voluntary , than in Europe , where it is official policy . During the last recession , 134,275 workers in Arizona , California and Oregon participated in work-sharing programs that permitted them to get partial unemployment-insurance payments . An employee who works 20% fewer hours may thus lose only 8% of total compensation . At Signetics , a California electronics firm , some 4,000 employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layoffs . Last year about 2,000 workers took part in the program .
