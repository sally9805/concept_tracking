FLUSHING MEADOW , N.Y . - On the Scoreboard page it will look exciting , images of radiant forehands and flashy serves . The Davis Cup quarterfinals . Ivan Lendl of Czechoslovakia defeats John McEnroe of the United States , 6-4 , 14-12 , 7-5 . It wasn ' t exciting . It can only be said that Lendl fell to the occasion . Before 17,445 fans ( 6561 of whom were admitted for free ) , and some who were so uncomfortable in the 98-degree heat that they laid down across the seats , prompting one writer to say the match had gone from the " supine to the riduculous , " McEnroe collapsed . Not physically and not intentionally , but emotionally . All the swirls and smiles of his Wimbledon win , and the persistent questions about his English oubursts , possible suspension and $1000 fines left him drained and flat . " I wanted to win because this is the Davis Cup , " he said , fatigue in his voice from the 3-hour , 16-minute match . " But I didn ' t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game together . " It was not a national disgrace . But US captain Arthur Ashe called this the best Davis Cup team in more than 40 years . It fell to Jimmy Connors , who beat Tomas Smid , 6-3 , 6-1 , 6-2 , to even the score in the best-of-five match , three- day series . Today Bob Lutz and Stan Smith will face Lendl and Smid in doubles , which means the contest will be decided on Sunday . The matchups are reversed then , McEnroe plays Smid and Connors plays Lendl ( who has not beaten Connors in seven meetings ) . " I never should have lost to him on this surface , " said McEnroe , the two- time US Open champion who lost his first Davis Cup match on a hard surface and only third overall . " I had my chances to win . " In the first set , McEnroe broke Lendl in the fourth game to take a 3-1 lead , but Lendl broke back immediately when McEnroe took a badminton swing at an overhead , one of four whiffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired to complain , even being so egalitarian once that he put the ball down in the service court to indicate that Lendl ' s serve , which had been called out , had landed fair . Each player held serve until the ninth game , when Lendl fired a crosscourt service return to break McEnroe at 15-40 . McEnroe ' s first serve , more of a dismissal than a weapon , landed on target only 40 percent of the time . " He seemed to get tired in the second set , " said Lendl , who beat McEnroe a month ago at the French Open . " But I lost in the first round at Wimbledon and practiced in Florida for 10 days . I would have traded him another week at Wimbledon , though . " In the 25th game of the second set ( there are no tiebreakers in Davis Cup play ) , Lendl ripped a backhand service return to break McEnroe and both players headed for the sidelines , but umpire Kurt Magnusson called the ball out . Three points later , Lendl hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead . " I know it sounds crazy , " said McEnroe , " but I ' m almost glad he broke me . It was his game three points earlier . I don ' t like to get shafted , and I don ' t like to see anybody else get shafted . " McEnroe had changed his shirt by the third set , the ballboys had been replaced and even the umpire looked weathered . When Magnusson said the score , prounounced " Game Czechoslo-vaykia " as if Peter Sellers were saying , " shake und bake-ia , " the fourth largest crowd ever to see a Davis Cup match laughed quietly . It was too hot to do anything else .
