Boston ' s school superintendent-elect Robert R. Spillane said yesterday he would be " extremely disappointed " if his new salary were not increased to $60,000 a year , but that he plans to take the job in any event . After a closed session with Spillane last Monday , some School Committee members expressed doubt that the New York State deputy commissioner of education was still committed to coming to Boston . He reportedly told committee members he would need $20,000 a year more than the job ' s statutory salary of $50,000 to not lose money by switching jobs . The committee reportedly rejected the $70,000 request and Spillane reportedly agreed to ask for $60,000 . The Albany job paid $60,000 a year . A day after the meeting with Spillane , the School Committee voted 4-1 to ask the City Council and Mayor Kevin H. White to agree to increasing the superintendent ' s salary to $60,000 . The council referred the request to committee . A spokesman for White said it would be premature for the mayor to state his views on the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spillane made public for the first time yesterday the fact that he plans to accept the job even if the salary remains at $50,000 . " I am not holding up the School Committee on this issue at all , " Spillane said . " I am just trying to do what I think is reasonable . " Spillane denied that he acted inappropriately in seeking an immediate salary increase when he had applied for the job knowing the salary was set by law at $50,000 . If the School Committee had followed the usual process , Spillane said , it would have agreed on its choice for superintendent , met with him privately and agreed on salary and other arrangements before his selection was made public . " As far as I am concerned , " he said , " I am not a chattel mortgage . I am a free agent . And I plan to discuss all those things with the committee . Unfortunately that is after the fact , but that is not my fault . That is the fault of the process . " Spillane refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but committee members said later that he pointed out that the move would cost him money , even if the Boston salary is set at $60,000 . He said he would have to give up a favorable mortgage for one that , at today ' s interest rates , could double his monthly payments , according to committee President John D. O ' Bryant . Except for Elvira Pixie Palladino , the lone dissenter on the request that the superintendent ' s salary be increased , committee members wrote to the mayor and council that $60,000 is " fully justified . " " Inflation alone has rendered the proposed new salary even less in real dollars than that rate ( $50,000 ) established in 1978 , " their letter said . Spillane ' s request for an increase on Monday reportedly took at least two committee members by surprise . One senior school official said he sensed annoyance on the committee that salary , at this stage in the six-month effort to hire a new superintendent , had become an issue . " I really think the committee members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say disappointed , " said the official , who asked not to be named . " They think they had an agreement with someone . " Spillane , who says he hopes to begin work by Aug. 1 , said yesterday he does not feel the issue will get him off to a bad start in his new job , however . " I believe in this particular case , our discussions are reasonable peoplediscussing issues that need to be discussed , that haven ' t been discussed up to this point , " he said .
