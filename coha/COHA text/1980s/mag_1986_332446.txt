The press has learned from experience that there are two kinds of expensive libel suits : the ones it loses and the ones it wins . Even meritless complaints can lead to costly court battles , a threat that can inhibit even the wealthiest news organizations . Last week the U.S. Supreme Court gave the news media important relief with a ruling that encourages judges to dismiss unworthy suits before they go to trial . <P> The court 's decision stemmed from a libel suit against the Investigator , a magazine published by muckraking Columnist Jack Anderson . In three articles published in 1981 , the Investigator charged that the ultraconservative Liberty Lobby and its founder , Willis Carto , were neo-Nazi , anti-Semitic and racist . Carto and his organization sued Anderson and the magazine , claiming that they had used patently unreliable sources . <P> In 1984 the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia ruled that a trial judge had erred in throwing out the case before it went to trial . Significantly , the appeals-court decision was written by Antonin Scalia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarded as no friend of the press . Judge Scalia 's view was supported by a now famous footnote in a 1979 Supreme Court ruling written by Chief Justice Warren Burger . In that case , Burger noted that in order to prove " actual malice "  --  the stiff standard public figures must meet to win a libel case  --  plaintiffs have the right to inquire into a reporter 's " state of mind . " Such a complex undertaking , stated the Chief Justice , " does not readily lend itself to summary disposition . " Burger 's aside sent a message to lower-court judges that led to a surge of libel trials . <P> By its 6 to 3 decision overturning Scalia 's opinion , the court seemed to say , " Ignore previous message . " Writing for the majority , Justice Byron White held that when examining a motion for summary judgment , judges must determine " whether the evidence presented is such that a reasonable jury might find that actual malice had been shown with convincing clarity . " Specifically , said White , judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear and convincing " standard of the landmark 1964 libel case , New York Times Co. vs . Sullivan . The effect would be to make libel complaints more difficult to justify at the pretrial stage . <P> The court 's decision was heralded in newsrooms . " It 's the high cost of litigation that has been stifling investigative reporting , " said Anderson . " I think this decision will reverse all of that . " Some First Amendment experts were afraid that the court had not given explicit enough criteria to lower courts , but the decision may have an impact beyond the strict letter of its language . " In some cases the melody is more important than the words , " said Libel Attorney Bruce Sanford of Washington . Whether lower-court judges will face the music remains to be seen .
