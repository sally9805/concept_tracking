With caution and restraint , the opposition fights on <P> Lech Walesa was back in the spotlight last week , holding aloft a bouquet of flowers and basking in the cheers of 1,500 supporters gathered near the Lenin Shipyard in the Baltic port of Gdansk . Four years ago , the outspoken electrician had scaled the shipyard gates and assumed the leadership of a strike that gave birth to Solidarity , the Communist bloc 's first independent trade union . Solidarity was officially suspended in 1981 , when the regime of General Wojciech Jaruzelski declared martial law and detained most of the union 's leaders . But as Walesa and his fellow workers showed last Friday , the anniversary of the 1980 Gdansk agreement that legally recognized the union , the spirit of Solidarity was still alive . <P> With familiar chants of " Solidarnosc ! " the crowd joined Walesa in defiantly flashing the V sign and singing the patriotic hymn God Who Watches Over Poland , as hundreds of grim-faced policemen looked on . But Walesa was seeking no showdown . After leaving his bouquet at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riots in 1970 , he quietly thanked his supporters for coming and drove away . <P> The peaceful celebrations underscored the opposition 's new mood of restraint in the wake of the government 's decision last July to free 652 political prisoners . The Jaruzelski regime was taking a calculated risk in hopes of boosting its credibility at home and abroad . So far , the gamble has paid off : not only has the U.S. relaxed some of the sanctions it imposed after martial law , but the freed prisoners have shown little of the radicalism espoused during the heady days of Solidarity . <P> Their moderation is based partly on the need to take stock of new realities in Poland . Said Jacek Kuron , a leader of the dissident intellectual group KOR : " To make any political evaluations now would be irresponsible . The only perspective I have had is that of prison . " Moreover , the sometimes bloody experience of martial law has taught dissidents the futility of opposing head-on a regime backed by tanks and guns . " We have learned our lesson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solidarity 's Warsaw-based Mazowsze chapter . " We will no longer play into their hands . We know we can not beat them by gathering in the streets . "
