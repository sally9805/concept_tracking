The Arabs try to find a common approach to an accommodation with Israel <P> It was a timeless ritual of power and brotherhood . Dressed in the long , flowing arbayas of Bedouin chieftains , Saudi King Khalid , Crown Prince Fahd and Prince Abdullah sat in a sumptuous lounge at Riyadh International Airport last week and awaited their royal guests . One by one , special jetliners landed , carrying the rulers of the five Persian Gulf nations that , along with Saudi Arabia , constitute the Gulf Cooperation Council ( G.C.C. ) . * Fahd and Abdullah emerged onto the shimmering tarmac to greet each arriving sheik and sultan , then escorted him in to meet the King . While white-robed Saudi national guardsmen , armed with machine guns and golden daggers , looked on , the rulers exchanged embraces and sipped cups of hot , aromatic coffee before being whisked off by limousines to their luxurious suites at the Nasseryah Conference Palace . <P> The two-day convocation in the Saudi capital , the second meeting of the six-month-old G.C.C. , may well be remembered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the complex and convoluted Middle East . The six rulers , whose combined oil reserves represent about one-third of the world 's total , took the first steps toward playing a role in international diplomacy commensurate with their financial power . Their decisions included final approval of a far-reaching economic treaty that could turn the organization into a Gulf States common market , and agreement to set common regional defense priorities . But by far their most dramatic step was to endorse a Middle East peace plan that was getting increasing backing in Europe and the Arab world as an alternative approach to the flagging Camp David talks for working out a settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict . <P> First suggested by Crown Prince Fahd last August , the proposal reiterates Arab demands for a Palestinian state but implies Arab recognition of Israel 's right to exist ( see box ) . The Gulf States ' endorsement could be the first step toward transforming the Fahd proposal into a pan-Arab peace plan , provided the Saudis can win approval for it at the 23-nation Arab League summit in Fez , Morocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the Palestine Liberation Organization , endorses the Fahd plan , the step would be the most important in Arab summitry since the Rabat meeting in 1974 that recognized the P.L.O . as the sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people . <P> But the Saudis , who were touring Arab capitals last week drumming up support for their plan , had some opposition . The Libyans were working just as vigorously against the plan among their allies , including radical P.L.O . groups , Syria , Algeria and South Yemen , which at this point are not prepared to recognize Israel 's right to exist at all . As the Fez summit approached , the future of the Saudi plan depended on two key questions : 1 ) Would the Libyans draw the other Arab hardline states into intractable opposition ? 2 ) Would the P.L.O . endorse the proposal ? <P> P.L.O . Leader Yasser Arafat , who has called the Fahd plan " a good beginning , " although he has not backed it , was lobbying discreetly to put the proposal on the Fez agenda .
