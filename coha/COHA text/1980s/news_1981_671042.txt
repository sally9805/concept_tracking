But the official , Boutros Ghali , Minister of State for External Affairs , added that to broaden this peace and make it stable , " the key is United States pressure on Israel " to take the next step in solving the problem of Palestinian autonomy. // " We have an Eisenhower complex , " Mr. Ghali said . In January 1957 , with Israeli forces fighting in the Suez Canal area , President Eisenhower " intervened , put real pressure on the Israelis , and they withdrew from Sinai in 40 days , " he said. // As examples of what the Reagan Administration might do , he listed a reduction in American arms deliveries to Israel and a modification of the law that permits Americans to take tax deductions for contributions to Israel . Like a number of other Egyptian officials interviewed , Mr. Ghali maintained that Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel was jeopardizing support for Israel among American Jews . <> <> Defense Chief Agrees // The ceaseless Cairo traffic rumbled by , shaking the floors of the British colonial-style ministry building and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French-trained lawyer , discussed the range of Egyptian diplomacy. // It was quieter outside Cairo in the army living quarters in which Egypt ' s Defense Minister , Lieut . Gen. Abdel Halim Abu Ghazala , was interviewed , but the points he made were much the same . Asked what Egypt would do if the Camp David talks on Palestinian autonomy were stalemated two years from now , the general replied that " peace would be contined. " // The tall and husky hero of the 1973 war against Israel continued : " As far as can be seen , for the next 10 years or more , Egypt will be primarily concerned with internal economic development. " // Like colleagues who did not want to be identified , Mr. Ghali and General Abu Ghazala were picking their way between giving the Israelis confidence that the Egyptian-Israeli peace will remain solid even after Israeli withdrawal from Sinai in April , and trying to reestablish Egypt ' s position in the Arab world . <> <> April Seen as Watershed // As Western diplomats here never tire of saying , April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egypt is to give Israel no excuse for failing to complete the withdrawal from Sinai. // Mr. Ghali emphasized that his Government expected that establishing stable relations between Israel and the Arab world would take " a very long time . " But he argued that if Israel made " a beginning toward a Palestinian solution now , it will cause a real change in the whole Middle East - despite everything done by Begin in the last two years. " // He said moderate Arab countries such as Saudi Arabia and Jordan attached high priority to movement on Palestinian autonomy now and were prepared to reciprocate Israeli efforts . He acknowedged , however , that he had no hard evidence or commitments about this. // " If after six months , diplomacy has not worked , the Israelis could return to what they were doing before , " Mr. Ghali said . " If after 12 months , there still was no movement from the Arab side , they can decide to build new settlements .

" But I reverse the question and ask , what will they lose ? They have the trump cards - the territory , the forces , and basically , American support . " <> <> ' Confidence Building ' Urged // It was not clear exactly what steps Mr. Ghali and other Egyptian officials expected of Israel now . They did say they preferred concrete moves toward self-government for the Palestinians . When asked for specifics , Mr. Ghali mentioned " confidence-building measures " such as giving the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip more free speech and allowing the return of certain moderate Palestinian leaders. // Like Israeli officials interviewed last week , Egyptian officials criticized what they saw as the absence of a Reagan Administration policy toward the Middle East .

" It all depends on the United States. " // " For Egypt , we will continue the Camp David process , " he continued . " This is different from saying we have time . Time is passive , will is active . In our thinking , we have established an irreversible process. " // He pointed to similar statements by President Hosni Mubarek to the effect that there is " no return " from Camp David . <> <> Israelis Fear a Trick // A prime question in Israel is whether the April watershed might turn into an Egyptian trick to reclaim Sinai and then stop the peace process. // Mr. Ghali reacted to this with some heat , saying the West in general and the Americans and Israelis in particular do not understand Egypt . The Jews , he said , lived in ghettos in Europe for centuries and have been " living in a ghetto in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he said , can be relied upon for three reasons : Unlike other Arab countries , it has very few Palestinians to cause internal trouble ; Egyptians have had stable institutions " almost as old as the American , " and there has been stability of leadership. //
