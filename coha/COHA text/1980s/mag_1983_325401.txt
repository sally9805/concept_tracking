The Boland Amendment forbidding U.S. attempts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua is the latest in a long series of congressional efforts to legislate highly specific restraints on presidential conduct of foreign policy . The movement picked up most of its steam in the 1970s , out of congressional revulsion from the Viet Nam War and the " imperial presidency . " But the results have been mostly ineffective or worse . Notable items : <P> &gt; The War Powers Resolution of 1973 required the President to notify Congress within 48 hours if he sent U.S. forces into any situation in which they faced " imminent " danger of being involved in combat and to withdraw them within 60 days unless Congress approved their mission . Presidents have complied with its letter without really involving Congress in military decisions . For example , Jimmy Carter formally notified Congress of the mission to rescue the hostages in Iran after it had been launched , had failed and been scrubbed . <P> &gt; The Jackson Amendment of 1974 made a Soviet-American trade agreement conditional on Kremlin pledges to ease restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trade agreement already in effect , thus helping to kill dtente , and did nothing whatever to ameliorate the plight of Soviet Jews . <P> &gt; The Nelson-Bingham amendments , attached to a series of foreign assistance acts beginning in 1974 , allowed Congress to veto major arms sales negotiated by the Administration . They have led to knock-down political brawls over several major deals , notably the sale of F-15 fighters and later AWACS planes to Saudi Arabia . But in the end , Congress has approved every sale that has been put to a vote . <P> &gt;The Turkish Arms Embargo of 1975 was aimed at punishing Turkey for its invasion of the island of Cyprus . While the embargo was being debated , Turkey expanded the area of Cyprus that it controlled from 25% to 40% . <P> &gt; The Clark Amendment of 1976 forbade U.S. aid to " military or paramilitary operations in Angola . " Proponents claim it kept the U.S. from getting bogged down in an African Viet Nam . Foes assert that it facilitated a Marxist takeover of Angola . <P> Despite this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Republican Senator William Cohen of Maine : " We do have a heavy hand when a surgeon 's hand is required . But we simply are not prepared to let the President commit the country to a policy that is not sound . "
