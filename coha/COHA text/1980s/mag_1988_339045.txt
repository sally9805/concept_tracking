The legendary 19th century Military Theorist Karl von Clausewitz called it simply the " fog of war , " that unfathomable combination of human personality , weapons performance and just plain luck that makes battle so unpredictable . This " fog , " the Pentagon declared last week , was largely to blame for the tragic decision by the U.S.S. Vincennes on July 3 to shoot down Iran Air Flight 655 , killing 290 civilians . <P> Captain Will C. Rogers III ordered two missiles launched at the Airbus , a Navy board of inquiry concluded , for two reasons only : the plane was heading directly toward his ship in a combat situation , and it had not responded to twelve radio demands that it identify itself . Thus it had to be considered hostile . In a 53-page unclassified version of a 1,000-page report , the Pentagon admitted that the Iranian aircraft was not descending toward the Vincennes or emitting military identifying signals , as the Navy originally claimed . <P> These misreadings of radar data were attributed to " human errors " made by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were not crucial in triggering Rogers ' decision to act . Contrary to the implications of an earlier , leaked version of the report , Carlucci said , no one will be punished , because " these mistakes were not due to negligence or culpability . " <P> Both Carlucci and Admiral William Crowe , Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , stressed that the Vincennes ' captain , while under the difficult circumstances of engaging armed Iranian speedboats , had less than four minutes in which to make his fateful decision . The ship was heeling at 32 degrees in a sharp turn . " Things were falling in the CIC ( ( combat information center ) ) , lights were flickering , and in the background , guns were booming , " said Carlucci . The sound of bullets hitting the ship 's hull rattled the crew . Rogers , said Crowe , had to assume that " the relentlessly closing " aircraft , which had taken off from a Bandar Abbas airport used by the military , was part of the Iranian attack unless he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . " <P> Initially , the Navy placed great weight on the detection of a so-called Mode II IFF ( identification , friend or foe ) signal from the approaching aircraft that identified it as an F-14 Tomcat jet fighter . Although crew members on the Vincennes CIC claimed to have seen this military signal , tape recordings show only a Mode III code , which is used by both civilian and military aircraft . <P> Why the false reading ? The report cites " stress , task fixation and unconscious distortion of data " by the crew as likely causes . Whatever the IFF signal , Crowe said , Rogers would not have relied on it alone , since Iranian military aircraft have been known to use Mode III to hide their identity . The report said the Airbus was not using its normal weather radar , which would have conclusively identified it as civilian . <P> Several critical technical questions remain unanswered . The air control tower at Bandar Abbas had been talking regularly by radio to the Airbus , but the Navy did not explain why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed that Iran Air Flight 655 should be in the air about this time , but nobody reacted when an officer standing behind Rogers in the CIC raised the possibility that the oncoming airplane was a commercial flight .
