This is a messianic month , and the true believers of the Democratic Party think they 've found a savior in Edward Kennedy , Or is it just another rough beast ? Teddy has a way of slouching toward the White House every few years , only to be turned back by the ill winds ' of opportunity or , a major miscalculation of politics . There was that awful moment when he bungled a television interview with Roger Mudd . Personal matters , not to put too fine a point on it , always rear their Medusa heads just as Kennedy boomlets begin : the drowning , the divorce , even that old college cheating scandal . People have long memories for the esoterica.of Kennedy family history . In the meantime , between campaigns , Kennedy , who has long been a liberal stalwart , appears to be trying to position himself in the forefront of a winning constituency . No one knows for sure , of course , but right-now the hot sector of the electorate looks like the young white middle class . As luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ronald Reagan found his majority , so it will be no simple task for a Democrat to capture it . But the party leadership is determined to try . Democratic National Committee chair Paul G. Kirk Jr . told a gathering of state leaders ' at Disney World last month to emphasize issues that " reflect the shared aspirations of average Americans , " which is a polite way of saying it 's time to give up on all those other aspirations  --  for social equity , public justice and progressive reform  --  that were once reflected in party platforms . The new issues and values , Kirk continued , in case anyone missed the point , are " the unifying common interest themes of family , of work , of education , of fiscal pragmatism and economic opportunity , of equality and competitiveness , of patriotism and a more secure future . " So it 's goodbye to " fairness " and " compassion . " The new look will be consonant with the results of public opinion research commissioned by the D.N.C. after the mudslide defeat last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice . " They see it as a code word meaning ' giveaway , ' " one committee staff member told a reporter . On the other hand , respondents to a poll and participants in forty-odd discussion groups around the country , overwhelmingly favored government-subsidized loans for first-time home buyers and aid for college students without- requiring a family means test . What is emerging from the research , in all likelihood , is a strategy that will appeal to those , few financial interests of the Reagan middle class that Reagan has ignored . God forbid that false messiahs arise to challenge the Kirk theology , but if they do , the D.N.C. is ready with countermeasures . The Democratic and Republican party chairs recently agreed to take future Presidential debates out of the hands of the League of Women Voters , or any other nonpartisan group , and sponsor the media events themselves . The new arrangement will make if easier to exclude third-party candidates ( for instance , Jesse Jackson ) and to keep the debate within limits convenient to both parties . In effect , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonmembers and consumers will pay the price . Tax ( Yawn ) Reform A. ng , fter huffing and puffing , wheeling and deali - Representative Dan Rostenkowski and his Ways and Means Committee have produced a tax bill that improves slightly on the outrageous Rea-. gan subsidy for the very rich . It has little else to recommend it . Like Reagan , Rostenkowski cuts individual taxes by about $130 billion , shifting the burden to business . The gain . for individuals could prove illusory , though , because large Corporations will pass on their tax increases to consumers by raising prices . Both measures could contribute significantly to reviving an inflation now held in check by high unemployment and a still overvalued dollar . - At least , the Ways and Means measure is a trifle fairer to those unfOrtunate enough to earn less than $200,000 . By raising President Reagan 's top bracket of 35 percent to 38 percent , it gives the very rich a tax cut only one-third as large as Reagan 's does . Middle-income earners fare much the same in both bills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do markedly better under Rostenkowski than Reagan. , Nor is Rostenkowski 's plan so hostile to working men and women . Unlike Reagan 's , his spares many of their benefits from taxation , It does tax unemployment compensation , however . Apparently both Rostenkowski and Reagan have concluded that the jobless do n't vote . Whatever it does , the Ways and Means bill reforms nothing and simplifies nothing . Reform would have taxpayers - with the same income paying the same amount . But under Rostenkowski , as under Reagan , you are better advised to draw income from real estate ; oil or municipal bonds than from a job in a plant or an office . Unless , of course , you ; , have a large expense account for wining , dining and other necessary business expenses . Reagan made a pass at reducing this deductible bonanza ; Rostenkowski has batted it down . . Above all , Rostenkowski , like Reagan , deals a body blow to the principle of progressive taxation , the sensible idea - that those who are better off should pay more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , Rostenkowski 's to four . Both move the country closer to the flat tax , a single bracket insuring that those who sleep under the bridge and those who finance its - construction will be taxed at the same rate . Tax bills can be written to raise revenue to pay for the expenses of government ; to promote some . social purpose , like housing or the arts and sciences ; or for macroeconomic objectives , to stimulate a depressed economy or cool off one that is overheated . Apart from removing about 6 million working poor from the tax rolls , the Reagan and Rostenkowski measures lack a socially redeeming - purpose . If anything , the Senate is likely to strip- away some of Rostenkowski 's modest improvements andcrestore Reagan 's largesse to the wealthy . It would do betterstocbury the bill . The combination of a Treasury Department that is the most class-conscious since Andrew Mellon 's and a Congress that is blinded by Reagan 's popularjity ratings will inevitably produce a tax bill that serves only the privileged , Y , P. Q. , R.I. P. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political vision of democratic socialism wedded to insurgent nationalism that was unique on the North American continent . The marriage was never perfect . Leaders , militants and voters came to the P.Q. for their own reasons and with their own priorities , and even the charismatic Rene Levesque was unable to integrate then-1 , , Most of Anglophone Canada was , dead set against independence for Quebec in any form , and the political and corporate counteroffensive was devastating . As soon as the P.Q. won provincial power in 1976 , businesses pulled out , people moved away and a subtle strategy , of destabilization was put into effect  --  with considerable U.S. help  --  to , make sure Quebec would not speak long or loudly with a separate voice . In time , the nationalist sentiment waned , or at least the movement for souverainete slowed . The P.Q. failed to win approval for its independence plans in a referendum , and the issue was downgraded in the face of pressing economic concerns . Quebec is rich in resources , but its development has been strikingly uneven , , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : absentee investors , an aging industrial infrastructure , marginally profitable agriculture and an expensive bureaucracy . There were bitter disputes in the party about the proper path around such obstacles , but Levesque seemed determined , to steer to the right , to win the support of provincial , - , federal and foreign business interests at the expense of socialist experiments . ' Like Francois Mitterrand , who is in certain ways his co-lingual counterpart , Levesque virtually . abandoned the principled policies for nvhich he was elected . - - Movements away from principle rarely work as well as those headed in the opposite direction . Levesque held on until last summer  --  too long , Quebecers thought  --  and then resigned . Parliamentary elections were held last week , and the P.Q. was deluged by the Liberal Party , reborn after its trouncing nine- years ago . Levesque was nowhere to be found on election day ; there were reports that he was in Greece or Egypt ? or simply secluded in Montreal . He might take comfort in two small electoral events . His old rival Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1976 , - lost his own bid for a parliamentary seat even as his party triumphed . And the New Democratic Party , an Anglophone socialist party that has significant power in several picivinces but had been only a marginal force in Quebec elections , did surprisingly well in several progressive ridings . ' IfLevesque 's program is ever to be revived , it could well be in a party alignment that gives more weightaxob the socialist half of the marriage with Quebec natibnalistrn - Lab ! Independence 1 . ast month 's narrow defeat of a House bill to delay plant closings was not just another setback for the American labor movement . It confirmed ? if proof was needed  --  that the unions ' political strategy of reliance on friendly Democrats is obsolete . The House-VOted 208 to 203 to kill a measure that would have required companies to give ninety days ' advance notice of plant closings affecting one hundred or more workers . Given the Democrats ' 253-to-182 majority in the House , union leaders and their allies in church , civil rights and women 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a Vote for common courtesy , " argued one lobbyist . But busineSS - groups headed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers swayed many of the fifty-four Democrats who voted with the opposition , including putative liberals Patricia Schroeder of Colorado and Les ' AuCoin. of Oregon . Only - twenty RepublicanS voted for ' the bill . The vote was ' a freebie for any House member who wanted to record a pro-labor vote . No one expects the Senate to act on similar legislation in this session , and President Reagan would certainly veto such a bill in the unlikely event that it passed . But against the protests of workers who can expect to be told on Friday afternoon , " Do n't come in Monday , " the House majority insisted that management 's " flexibility " in plant-closing decisions must be guaranteed . Many local trade unionists acquitted themselves well in hometown lobbying for the bill . The United ' Electrical Workers joined with the United AutornObile Workers , United Steelworkers and local A.F.L.-C.I.O. central labor councils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bill from conservative Republicans-Thomas Ridg6 of Erie and Donald Ritter of Allentown . But in many other parts of the country , unions merely went through the motions of making calls and writing letters . The small band of about two dozen union lobbyists who worked for the bill in Washington was outgunned by an army of business lobbyistS . The House vote is just another example of hOw the Democratic Party establishment is seeking to shed'its pro-labor image . In March the party 's chair , Paul G. Kirk Jr. , asked the unions not to endorse future Presidential candidateS before the primary season begins . Senator Edward Kennedy , gearing up for a 1988 run for the Presidency , embraced the crackpot Gramm-Rudman budget-cutting bill over - union objections . Heavy hitters in the Democratic Leadership Council , among them Representative Richard Gephardt of Missouri , Senators Sam Nunn of Georgia and Joseph Biden of Delaware and Governor Bruce Babbitt of Arizona , want to move the party from the =center to the right . " We have to quit running on labor 's agenda , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hell out of the house of labor : " - Indeed , labor would be better off if it were to strike out for new political territory . A move toward independent political action does not necessarily entail organizing a third party or cutting off support for decent liberal Democrats , - or liberal Republicans . At this point- it should be ' a philosophical break , underlined perhaps by an amicable labor walkout from the Democratic National Committee . Once the break is made , unions can begin forming coalitions on issues , rather than for Democratic candidates . Independent political action will mean takitig risks . Unionists who challenge corporate dominance of the economy , management control of the workplace and other purported " rights " of capital  --  articles of faith for the Demb : : cratic Party  --  will be called radicals . So be it : By untying itself from the Democrats and going to the rank and file on such issues , the labor movement can open roach to revival . LANCE COMPA             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
