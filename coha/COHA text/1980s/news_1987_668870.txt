Most of the patients Evanston plastic surgeon Harry A. Table Springer sees " want to look like themselves-only a little bit better . " Springer helps them do that . About half of his practice is devoted to cosmetic work-straightening noses , lifting sagging faces and building up or reducing breasts , among other things . Springer also performs liposuctions , the much-publicized operations in which fat is sucked out of the <> body using a flexible plastic tube . The other half of his practice is devoted to reconstructive work . A graduate of the Northwestern University Dental School and the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School , Springer , who has been practicing for 16 years , is a clinical associate professor at Loyola University ' s Stritch School of Medicine . He is on the staffs of St. Francis Hospital in Evanston and Ravenswood and Louis A. Weiss Table Hospitals in Chicago . When writer Robert C. Cooper caught up with him one evening recently , Springer , 49 , had just returned home from the hospital where his wife , Mavis , had given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been married seven years , have one other child , toddler Margo Louise . <> Cosmetic surgery is not for everyone . It is not something that someone should expect will change their entire lifestyle-or even change it significantly . From a psychological standpoint , you need a healthy individual . There are some patients who come in and say they ' re depressed or that no one likes them . These are the patients that I ' m particularly interested in listening to . I want to find out why they want surgery . You have to want cosmetic surgery for the right reasons . The motivation has to come from within , not from someone else-a husband who tells a wife : " I don ' t like you because your nose isn ' t pretty enough , " or , " Your breasts are too big , " or , " You ' ve had a couple of children , and your abdomen looks funny " ; there ' s something seriously wrong with that relationship . I have rejected patients outright . Occasionally , women will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And they realize that they ' ve got to get back into the dating process and such . And they say to themselves , " I ' d better sharpen things up . " You find this out . You prefer not to do surgery on someone who has been recently divorced or has been grieving over the loss of a spouse or even a boyfriend . They need to get the grieving period out of the way and sort of clear their sights . About 85 percent of my patients who want cosmetic procedures are women . They don ' t want to look like Playboy bunnies ; they don ' t want to look like Dolly Parton . They are not vain . I think the first definition of vanity in Webster ' s is to look better than others . Most of my patients want to look as good as they can ; their expectations are realistic . They ' re not nuts . They ' re not Hollywood stars . They ' re just plain , everyday people . Which star would probably need the least amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face ? The only one who comes to mind is Jaclyn Smith . Cybill Shepherd also has a very pretty face , although I wouldn ' t mind getting a hold of her nose . On occasion someone comes in and says , " I want this done and that done , and I want to look like so-and-so . " That ' s not very realistic . I sit them down and find out what they really want , why they want it , and I ' ll examine them and see what is possible . Then I will lay the options out in front of them . You have to leave a little bit to the imagination . We ' re not dealing with clay or with an Erector set or with wood . In plastic surgery there is a certain amount of art , a certain amount of science and a certain amount of lack of control of things . I like to see the patient at least twice . Sometimes three times . The first time you find out what the patient wants , why they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then you need to tell them what can be accomplished , the techniques available , the advantages and disadvantages of each , what the usual course of the procedure is . Can they be back to work in one week , two weeks , the next day ? Is it an inpatient or outpatient procedure ? Many procedures today can be done on an outpatient basis . What are the inherent risks ? The gentleman who taught me plastic surgery always said : " Any surgeon who claims that he doesn ' t have complications is either a liar , or he hasn ' t been operating . The one thing that is 100 percent is that the surgeon can give his best ; that ' s all you can ask . " Probably the biggest misconception about plastic surgery is that it will leave no scars . The basic fact of life is that the body repairs injury , whether it ' s an incision or any other type of injury , by the process of scarring . All the plastic surgeon can do is render scars that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tattoo , and then when it ' s no longer socially acceptable , they will want to get rid of it . Removing a tattoo will leave a scar . Hopefully , the scar will be much less conspicuous than the tattoo itself . I remember one patient who was a bit friskier in her early years . She had an Oriental tiger tattooed on her buttocks . Well , she wanted that one removed . She also had Winnie the Pooh holding a balloon , and she wanted that removed also . I did my best to remove them-but there was some scarring . Suction-assisted lipectomy , or liposuction , is getting a lot of publicity . The procedure is used to remove fat that can not otherwise be removed-most frequently from the hips , thighs , abdomen , lower extremities , arms , even around the breasts . It is a body-contouring procedure . It is not for people who are obese . How do you select a cosmetic surgeon ? You realize that once a person has a license to practice medicine , it ' s a license @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many people who do cosmetic surgery ; cosmetic surgery is very lucrative . Rhinoplasty ( a nose job ) runs between $1 , 500 and $6 , 000 ; a facelift is between $2 , 000 and $10 , 000 and a suction-assisted lipectomy ( or liposuction ) will run between $500 and $4 , 000 . The basic education of a plastic surgeon is plastic surgery ; he can take care of anything . He ' s not limited by his education as to what he can or can not do . So the first thing to ask is : Is the surgeon certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery ? This is certainly a good place to start , but I think you have to go beyond that . Ask your family physican or your internist . Talk to your friends . Call your county medical society . Cosmetic surgery is not as frivolous as many people think . It ' s a very serious business . One of my more gratifying cases involved a model named Debbie Miller . She and her husband were driving north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was Easter morning six years ago . Her husband was driving , and she was in the passenger seat . As they hit the first curve there , some guy hit them head on . She was not wearing her seat belt , and her head went through the windshield ; it tore her face up . In dealing with her there was certainly more than the just the physical flaws . Part of her living depended on her appearance , Not only was she a model , but she sang and played the flute . In addition , she was a very promising actress . The gratifying part was working with her , making her feel like she was going to get there some day ; that she would do much better than she was ; that her appearance was going to get better but it was going to take time ; that it would come back toward normal . It took a year for the emotional scars to fade and a number of procedures to make the physical scars fade . We ' re even working today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she is working now-as a model , actress , singer . I don ' t know if she ' s a professional flautist anymore , but she still picks up a flute once in a while . CAPTION : PHOTO : Tribune photo by Michael Fryer . Plastic surgeon Harry A.
