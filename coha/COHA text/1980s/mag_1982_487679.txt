The Republic Rubber plant on Albert Street in Youngstown , Ohio , was operated in the 1970s by Aeroquip , a subsidiary of the Libby-Owens-Ford conglomerate . The plant made . rubber hoses . In August 1978 , the parent conglomerate shut the plant . A joint committee of former managers and hourly employees asked Aeroquip whether it would be willing to sell the plant to them . The company said yes , gave the committee an option to buy and set a price of $2 million . Six former supervisors invested $100,000 in stock of the new company . The Dollar Bank of Youngstown ' loaned $1.35 million , guaranteed by the EcOnomic Development Administration of the Department of Commerce . The , Ur , ban Development Action Grant program of the Department of Housing and Urban Development Provided $750,000 through the City of Youngstown , and the Small Business . - Administration provided another $500,000 . The new enterprise was thereby able to pay $2 million for the plant while reserving $700,000 for working capital . Republic Rubber is a successful example of employee-community ownership made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal grants and Federal loan guarantees . The lesson of that experience , which will be increasingly important as other towns attempt to solve the problem of plant closings with employee buy-out plans , is a simple , one : worker ownership , particularly when capital requirements are high , is possible only with massive Federal help . - Other examples of employee-community ownership in the United States teach the same lesson . Steffi Domike , who worked at U.S. Steel 's Clairton Works , has studied the producers ' cooperatives in the Pacific Northwest plywood industry . These enterprises represent by far the strongest example of worker ownership in the United States : between 1942 and 1956 they produced about one fourth of the industry 's product . Domike found that during the first half of the century , the plywood industry was characterized by unchanging technology , relatively skilled labor and low capital requirements . When E. E. Westman organized the first cooperative in 1921 , he sold.125 shares for $500 down , $500 due , mostly to or through his Scandinavian friends . By 1964 , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than $5 million . As a result , the cooperatives ' role in the industry has been declining and it is unlikely that any new cooperatives will be formed . That lesson is not necessarily popular . Many Americans , including many American workers , believe that anything that requires Federal aid will be bureaucratically managedfrom Washington and should be opposed for that reason . These people would turn their backs on the idea of worker ownership requiring massive Federal money . - I think that is a mistake . The Federal financing needed to make employee-community ownership a reality does not prevent such an enterprise from being managed in a democratic , decentralized way , with workers making most of the decisions . We should get out of our heads the notion that Federal involvement means bureaucratic control from Washington . It is possible to take Federal money and place it in the hands of enterprises that are both locally managed and nationally supervised . One example is the Tennessee Valley Authority , at least as it was originally envisioned . Another is the national Legal Services Corporation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporation , which then allocates more than 95 percent of this sum to offices in the field . Each field office is managed by a combination of local lawyers and local clients . The field offices are supervised by the national corporation , which puts out regulations and monitors the offices ' work to make sure the regulations are being followed . In the case of Legal Services , the " product ' - ' is free legal service for those too poor to afford private attorneys . But the same management model would work for other kinds of products or services . Frank O'Brien , former , president of a steelworkerS ' local in Pittsburgh , has come up with the idea of a Monongahela Valley Authority as another example of how a plant with employee-community ownership could be locally managed . O'Brien has described his idea this way : " We should think about forming an industrial development authority and running the mills ourselves . . . . " I think back to the time when the Port Authority was born . Pittsburgh Railways was the big operator transporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a financial bind . So the Port Authority was formed , taking in all the , bus companies in Allegheny County as well . It bought up the railway and the bus companies because people still had to be transported . 1 . " Recently they decided to close down the J &L; ( Jones &; Laughlin steel company hot strip mill . A thousand people lost their jobs . . " A couple of Sundays later the mayor was out to our father-and-son Communion breakfast at St. Stephen 's in Hazelwood . He made a little speech and then he opened it up for questions . - So I got up . I said the mayor had better start worrying now about the U.S. Steel mills , that when they build that plant in Conneaut they 're going to shut down every plant up and down the river . " He said , ' Well , what would you do ? ' I told him , ' You , and the county . commissioners , sit down and form an authority , like - the Port Authority . We can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true  --  as I found out working in the unsuccessful campaign to buy the Lykes steel mill in Youngstown a few years ago  --  that absentee government bureaucrats can be as " unhelpful as absentee corporate bureaucrats . We should have expected as much . It should not have surprised us that under the Carter Administration , the Economic Development Administration was on intimate terms with steel industry executives and hostile to the proposal for employee-community ownership . We were na  --  ve to have imagined anything else was possible . But that failure does not diminish the need for social control of investment decisions in the steel industry . Nor does it weaken the argument that the most effective form of social control is some kind of public ownership . The lesson to be drawn is that so capital-intensive an industry as steel requires Federal financing , and this financing will be forthcoming only when the political complexion of the national government has changed . In my view , worker ownership or something like it will be necessary in the steel industry in the long run . Private industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills it needs . The only long-range solution will be for the government and workers , joining together , to do the job . ?
