It is all part of the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden , a 7 1/2-acre island of green on the north side of the Walker Art Center in the heart of Minneapolis . The garden , which celebrated its first anniversary last weekend , is considered the most extensive urban sculpture garden in the United States . In a January review , New York Times architecture and design critic Paul Goldberger said it represents ' ' the finest new outdoor space in the country for displaying sculpture. ' ' // // It also represents a triumph for the kind of public/private cooperation for civic improvement that the Twin Cities has been become known for. // The effort was spearheaded by Martin Friedman , director of the Walker Art Center , and David L. Fisher , superintendent of the Minneapolis Park and Recreation Board ; the garden is jointly run by their two institutions , with help from the Minnesota Landscape Arboretum , part of the University of Minnesota . A number of private donors also contributed individual works or funded the completion of various sections of the garden. // How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s own estimates , more than half a million visitors have traipsed through the park ' s long gravel paths , or allees , admiring 40 works by sculptors such as Claes Oldenburg , Anthony Caro , Frank Gehry , Ellsworth Kelly , Jacques Lipchitz , Henry Moore , Isamu Noguchi , and George Segal. // ' ' Its popularity is way beyond our expectations , ' ' says Mr. Fisher . The board recently reseeded the grass in several areas of the garden because ' ' the public has loved it to death . ' ' Last winter , Fisher says , he was amazed to find that , although ' ' the temperature was 10 degrees and it was snowing horizontally , there were troops of people walking through the park. ' ' // Yet despite all the use , there has been little abuse . ' ' People have a real public pride about ( the garden ) , ' ' says Fisher , ' ' a real sense of public ownership. ' ' // For its part , the Walker , a museum of contemporary art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the garden , says Mr. Friedman . It has increased both the number and type of people who come inside the Walker . ' ' We found a whole new constituency that had not come to a museum before , ' ' he says , ' ' who became entranced by the garden and thought they might as well walk across the street and see what is going on in the building. ' ' // The layout of the garden begins with four shrub-lined squares , each a kind of ' ' roofless gallery , ' ' says Friedman . The grid that is formed , with its roots in French and Italian Renaissance gardens , allows the modern sculptures to play ' ' against the grid , against the formality. ' ' // Two of the squares contain permanent exhibits ; the other two are used for rotating exhibits . The first of these , still in place , is called ' ' Inside Outside . ' ' It includes specially commissioned works by contemporary sculptors such as Jene Highstein , whose three-part untitled work , Mr. Friedman writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ovoids , hewn in fine-grained gray granite , . . . assertively modern , yet evocative of remotest antiquity. ' ' // Dominating the far northern end , away from the Walker , is ' ' Spoonbridge and Cherry , ' ' a whimsical giant sculpture and fountain arching over a man-made pond . It was designed specifically for the garden by Oldenburg and his wife , Coosje van Bruggen. // ' ' The garden itself is very formalistic , ' ' Ms. van Bruggen said of the work last year . ' ' It reminds me of Versailles . Louis XIV was known for the etiquette he enforced in the palace . So the spoon and cherry kind of fit right in , as a parody of table manners. ' ' // A three-part glass conservatory forms the western border of the garden . The central atrium rises 65 feet and contains towering Washingtonia palm trees , fragrant orange trees , and a 22-foot-high ' ' Standing Glass Fish , ' ' by architect/sculptor Frank Gehry. // The palm court , together with attached north and south houses , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasing indoor walkway between a parking lot and the Walker/Guthrie Theater complex . The south house contains rotating horticultural exhibits ( currently native Minnesota flowers and prairie grasses ) . The north house is highlighted by a series of green topiary arches . The arches are actually creeping fig vines attached to a stainless-steel frame , rather than the ' ' Victorian sense of plants shaped into a form , ' ' says Michael VanValkenburg , a Cambridge , Mass. , landscape architect who codesigned the conservatory gardens . A high-tech drip irrigation system feeds the vines. // To the east , the sculpture garden is bordered by a river of traffic , 16 lanes of highway formed by the convergence of several major arteries . One of the early goals of the project was to connect the Walker/Guthrie by foot with downtown Minneapolis , via Loring Park , on the far side of the highways . The task of designing a footbridge over the traffic was given to local architect Siah Armajani . His steel and wood structure , longer than a football field , is based on classic 19th-century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end doubles as viewing platforms for the garden ; a poem by John Ashbery stretches along the bridge in both directions , encouraging eyes upward and away from the blur of traffic. // For Friedman , who would like to see the garden expand someday to take in 3 1/2 more acres to the north , the outdoor setting gives sculpture a new context not possible inside. // ' ' The whole idea of having sculpture outdoors is that you have lots of ' borrowed views ' ; that ' s the term the Japanese use , ' ' he says . ' ' You incorporate whatever is around . . . The borrowed view here happens to be the skyline of Minneapolis. . . // ' ' You see objects through objects ; you see them under changing conditions of light , seasons , rain , snow . They take on different character . . . You have a different sense of scale when you work outdoors. ' ' // But perhaps his greatest pleasure , he says , has been in seeing how ordinary people of all ages and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great watching the joggers going through , the nursery school classes . ' ' Outside , he says , people view the sculptures ' ' more spontaneously , ( with ) more opinions , more possessively. ' ' // //
