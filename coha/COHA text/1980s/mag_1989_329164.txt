George Bush takes pains to overcome what he calls " the intimidation factor " by encouraging visitors to speak freely . Bush 's good-cop demeanor , however , is balanced by his combative chief of staff John Sununu , whose role is to keep discussions pointed , to make people defend their positions  --  and occasionally just to cut through the bull . <P> A group of bankers found that out the hard way recently after telling the President that they supported his efforts to rescue the savings-and-loan industry . Sununu pulled out an ad the bankers were running trying to scare depositors away from S &; Ls and into banks . " I take it , then , " he growled , " this sort of thing will stop . " When a utility boss complained that Bush 's clean-air proposals would drive up his electricity rates , Sununu retorted that the utility already enjoyed rates below the national average , which the Government subsidized . <P> Sununu puckishly allows , " I have been known to ask provocative questions . " His bad-cop act has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress and has left some staffers afraid to voice unpopular advice in his presence . Many consult more easily with Sununu 's own good cop , deputy to chief of staff Andrew Card . Colleagues were relieved when Card decided to stay at the White House rather than run for Governor of Massachusetts .
