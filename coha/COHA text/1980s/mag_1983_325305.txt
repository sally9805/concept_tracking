In Texas , two arms merchants face heavy time <P> One defendant was a dour ex-CIA agent with dark , glowering eyes and a tight-lipped G. Gordon Liddy demeanor . The other was a jovial Englishman who smokes Cuban cigars , drives a $60,000 custom-made Cadillac convertible and cracks jokes about himself as a " good ole boy " who " drills a little oil and raises a little beef on his 2,000-acre ranch near Dallas . Their personalities may differ , but the two millionaires have much in common . Both Edwin Wilson and Ian Smalley were on trial in Texas , in unrelated but remarkably comparable cases , charged with masterminding elaborate arms-smuggling deals in the Middle East . <P> In Houston , Wilson , 54 , was convicted of shipping 20 tons of plastic explosives from the city 's Intercontinental Airport to Tripoli in 1977 . In Dallas , Smalley , 42 , was charged with conspiring to smuggle 100 tanks to Iran and 8,300 antitank missiles to its foe Iraq . Both offered similar alibis : they were motivated by patriotism rather than profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved in covert operations sanctioned by the U.S. Government . <P> Wilson 's trial ended Saturday when the jury found him guilty on four smuggling-related charges . After the verdict federal prosecutors asked that Wilson be declared a " dangerous special offender , " claiming that he had " offered about $1 million " to a fellow prisoner to kill nine people , including Government attorneys and witnesses who testified against him . If U.S. District Judge Ross Sterling agrees , that could add eight years to Wilson 's possible sentence of 17 years in prison . <P> It was the second of four trials that Wilson faced on charges that he ran an international web of illegal arms deals and terrorist activities between 1976 and 1979 . In November he was convicted by a federal jury in Alexandria , Va. , of organizing the export of rifles and handguns to Libya . As he did in the first trial , Wilson 's lawyer , Herald Price Fahringer , argued that the defendant was a " de facto CIA agent " working undercover to get secrets for his former employer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Houston to Libya the largest illegal movement of explosives ever investigated by the U.S. Jerome S. Brower , a California explosives manufacturer and distributor who is an unindicted coconspirator , testified that Wilson , who left the CIA in 1970 , said he wanted " as much as I could get " of cyclotrimethylene trinitramine , a plastic explosive known as C4 . Brower said he shipped 42,300 Ibs. in 856 5-gal. cans disguised as " drilling mud , " a chemical lubricant used in oil-drilling rigs , from California to Houston , where it was loaded aboard a leased DC-8 . <P> According to the Government 's indictment against Smalley , the Englishman conspired to ship 100 vintage 50-ton tanks to Iran by using phony " end user 's certificates , " which gave the United Arab Emirates as the delivery site . He allegedly planned to buy the tanks from an Army depot in Anniston , Ala . He is also charged with conspiring to ship 8,300 antitank missiles to Iraq .                 @ @ @ @
