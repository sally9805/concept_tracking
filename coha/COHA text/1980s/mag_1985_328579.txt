When the Treasury Department unveiled its dramatic tax-reform plan last November , TIME 's Board of Economists was impressed by its boldness . Since then , the Reagan Administration has weakened or eliminated many of the most sweeping proposals . While that backsliding worried TIME 's board when it met in Washington last week to assess the tax package and consider the economic outlook ( see ECONOMY &; BUSINESS ) , members nonetheless endorsed the broad goals of the President 's program . Said Walter Heller , who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers in the Kennedy and Johnson Administrations : " This could well be the most far-reaching tax reform we 've ever had . " <P> Although final details of the plan were still being worked out when the board met , the economists were enthusiastic about the proposed sharp reduction in the number of brackets and the suggested lowering of rates . Board members noted that the changes greatly simplify the system and would encourage savings and enterprise . Moreover , the plan would achieve those benefits without adding to the burden of any group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , would not have to pay more to compensate for the rate drop in the upper bracket . Said Harvard Economist Martin Feldstein , Reagan 's former chief economic adviser : " I think the most important aspect of the tax-reform discussion is that it has highlighted the idea that top rates can be lowered in such a way that the share of personal taxes paid at each income level will remain about the same . " <P> The board was concerned , though , about the concessions to corporations , wealthy individuals and others that the Administration made in order to assemble a politically feasible package . The suggested cut in the rate at which capital gains are taxed and other similar moves , the economists feared , would turn the bill into a revenue loser and worsen the federal deficit . Said Alice Rivlin , former director of the Congressional Budget Office who is now at the Brookings Institution : " My big worry is not only that the President 's proposal will be a revenue loser , but that as you move through Congress , the temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little there , and that we will end up not with tax reform but with another tax cut . " <P> The board 's concern for revenues led members to endorse the Administration proposal to end the deduction of state and local taxes from federal returns . While that politically loaded move would be particularly hard on residents of high-tax states such as New York and California ( see chart ) , the impact would be limited to individuals who itemize their deductions . Board members pointed out that only a third of all taxpayers are itemizers . But the most compelling reason for eliminating the deduction , the economists said , is that to do so would raise revenue that is certainly needed . The Treasury Department estimates that closing the state-and-local loophole will bring $38 billion into Government coffers by 1990.
