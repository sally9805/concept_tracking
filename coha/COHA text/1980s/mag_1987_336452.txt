As the grandson of the founder of the Ford Motor Co. , Henry Ford II bore one of the most powerful names in American business . He used it wisely to save the second largest U.S. automaker in its dark days after World War II . He used it arrogantly when he put down executives who dared to contradict him by reminding them , " My name is on the building . " <P> During the 35 years that he ran the firm , Ford gathered around him men who became important leaders in their own right . Among them : Robert S. McNamara , Secretary of Defense under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and later head of the World Bank ; Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca ; and Charles ( " Tex " ) Thornton , who co-founded Litton Industries . Yet none of them ever claimed to understand the man they always addressed as Mr. Ford . When he died last week of complications from pneumonia in Detroit 's Henry Ford Hospital , he was still unfathomable . <P> Almost untouchable on his corporate throne , Ford was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once told him that his book would give Ford the chance to set the record straight about many things . Snapped Ford : " Oh , let the fairy tales continue . Who gives a damn ? " His most famous expression , which he borrowed from Benjamin Disraeli , the 19th century British Prime Minister : " Never complain . Never explain . " <P> Ford could afford to play high-stakes games , and he had fun doing it . He stunned the automobile world in 1968 , when he offered the presidency of Ford to Semon ( " Bunkie " ) Knudsen , then a top executive at General Motors . Ford rented an Oldsmobile and drove to Knudsen 's house to offer him the job . Within 19 months , though , Ford fired Knudsen , who had made the error of trying to get too chummy with the boss . One mistake : he constantly barged into Ford 's office without knocking . <P> Born Sept. 4 , 1917 , to Edsel and Eleanor Clay Ford , Henry led the privileged yet cloistered life of Henry Ford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . After Hotchkiss , Ford went to Yale , but he did not graduate . Reason : he paid a student to write a paper for him about Thomas Hardy 's novels . Although admitting that he cheated , Ford denied that he was caught because he accidentally dropped the bill for the student 's services into the professor 's lap . " I may be stupid , " he told Biographer Booton Herndon , " but I 'm not that stupid . " <P> After Yale , Ford worked in the company 's engineering department before going into the Navy in April 1941 . But in August 1943 , a month before his 26th birthday , Ford was released from active duty so that he could return to Detroit to help put the Ford Motor Co. back on its feet . Years of erratic one- man rule by old Henry had left the company a shambles , and the Government was afraid the firm would not be able to produce the amphibious vehicles and planes needed for the war effort . <P> The founder was then 80 and shakily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son Edsel from cancer . In his dotage , the old man had surrounded himself with managerial incompetents and given them enormous power . Among them was Harry Bennett , Ford 's pistol-toting aide-de-camp , who had become the company Rasputin . Young Ford demanded that his grandfather turn all management control over to him . " I want a completely free hand , " he said . The old man finally relented . In 1945 , at 28 , Henry Ford II took charge . His first act was to fire Bennett .
