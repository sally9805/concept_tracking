There was a bit of good news the other day when Stephen Dunleavy modestly disclosed that he is not running the Boston Police Department . Bostonians can breath a sigh of relief because Comr . Joe Jordan is still on the job . Dunleavy , 37 , is an aide to Mayor Kevin White . That means he ' s a spear carrier in Kevin ' s court , for which he is paid a princely $28,000 and no heavy lifting . Not bad . The spear carriers are several steps up the ladder from the gofers , who go for coffee and all that . Spear carriers are almost as interesting in Boston politics as their ultimate boss - Kevin White in this case - because they often get their own identity mixed up . They resort too often to the pronoun " we , " as in the phrase , " The way we feel about that is . . . " They love to be close to the man with the power . Anyway , Dunleavy sat in his sixth-floor City Hall office the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston police commissioner . " His private office has brown wall-to-wall carpeting , white walls and a nice view of downtown Boston . He is a tall and slim man with dark hair . Dunleavy reminds me of a grown-up Eddie Haskell of " Leave it to Beaver " television fame . He was named White ' s special assistant three years ago to coordinate the police , fire and public works departments . White was fed up with the three departments ignoring his direct orders . You know how it is with Kevin White . But the executive role never went smoothly for Dunleavy . Even his friends agree that he can be abrasive with very little effort . When he worked for former Police Comr . Robert diGrazia , he sometimes drove an unmarked car with the siren going , carried a special badge and loved to play cops . The real cops don ' t like him . Now he ' s closer to White , but in May he goofed and this week it was all in the newspapers . He wrote a briefing memo in May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactivation of the Boston harbor patrol . It was just a routine briefing memo , Dunleavy said . " We do them all the time when more than one city department is involved . " But the memo ' s tone was all wrong . It didn ' t take much smarts to realize that the memo to Jordan contained too many " you-will-do " phrases . The memo couldn ' t have been made public at a worse time , because Jordan currently is involved in a tough controversy with his own top officers over a planned reorganization . They claim Jordan is allowing Kevin White to dictate police policy . The Dunleavy memo was seen as substantiation of that theory . Would Kevin White , through one of his spear carriers , want to run the Police Department ? " No , " said Press Secretary George Reagan , 35 , another spear carrier . " The mayor sets overall policy for the department - high visibility of uniformed patrols , for example - but that is it . Joe Jordan runs the department and very well at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wonder where the line is drawn . Reagan has his office and a staff of " eight or nine " on the ninth floor , prompting speculation that the higher the City Hall office floor the better the job . Reagan gets $35,000 and no heavy lifting . Pretty good . Both Dunleavy and Regan are former Boston reporters , mediocre ones at that . Now they talk the Boston political pitter-patter that includes such words as " point man " ( liaison man ) and lots of the inevitable " we decided . . . " White mentioned during the last campaign that he probably would not run again , but the other day Reagan corrected that impression . He said the mayor was responding to a question and actually said , " This may be my last campaign , but I like to keep my options open . " White has shown no signs of tiring of the pomp and pageantry of office , still possesses a machine that again could defeat easily such marshmallows as Joe Timility . Maybe tighter control of the police department is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin White has given up his White House dream and has decided to follow the example of the late Chicago Mayor Richard Daley and make a life- time career of being Boston ' s mayor . God help us.
