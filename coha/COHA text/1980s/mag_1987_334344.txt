Many small companies find it too expensive or cumbersome to provide their employees with benefits like medical and dental insurance . Faced with that dilemma , more and more firms are discovering that the best way to take care of their employees is to let them go , then rehire them under lease . The workers are transferred to the employ of an employee-leasing agency , which sends them back to the same jobs . Because the leasing agency may have hundreds of workers , it can provide benefits like health insurance relatively cheaply . Many small-business operators are enthusiastic about the service . Says Real Provencher , whose Houston-area mail-order software firm uses ten leased workers : " The less time I have to spend worrying about bureaucracy , the more I can spend on making the business grow . " Some 350 leasing companies now employ more than 120,000 American workers .
