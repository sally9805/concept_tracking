The dreams all run together . Feed the world . Make a joyful noise , raise a ruckus and millions of dollars . Lift a voice . Lend a hand . Come to Wembley Stadium , in London . Go down to John F. Kennedy Stadium in Philadelphia . Turn on the television . Be a part of it all . <P> Ninety thousand came to JFK , 72,000 to Wembley . More than a billion people , including those in the Soviet Union , could have tuned in on live satellite broadcasts to watch over 60 of the world 's most prominent rock acts . All together , this dream was called Live Aid . The breadth and heart of it were great . <P> And there were great moments in the music . Elvis Costello asking the Wembley audience to join him in " this old northern English folk song " and performing a peerless acoustic guitar version of All You Need Is Love . Bono of the Irish band U2 singing a mesmeric Bad . Sting duetting with Phil Collins on Every Breath You Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and suggesting that a small portion of the Live Aid donations be used to help American farmers pay off mortgages . But the video superstructure constructed to beam the event across the world became an open-air jail with an infinite number of electronic windows . The audience could look in , but the musicians could never really bust out . <P> Television may be great for raising big bucks , but it is no friend of live music , especially not of rock ' n ' roll , which needs urgency , immediacy , volume and balance . Movies and videos can heighten rock performances . Movies are seen in an enclosed environment , usually with better sound than comes from the tinny tiny speaker of a typical TV . Videos are at home on television , but they , like film , depend on editing to duplicate and convey the raw power of the music . About all a television director can do is cut back and forth between cameras . The medium does not catch the excitement of a performance , it just secondhands it along . <P> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boomtown Rats and guiding spirit behind Live Aid , it obviously did not give him serious pause . He meant to raise money , and the tunes could match up to the ideal or not . Music was the come-on of the day , not the essence , and world television was like a vast electronic banking window . <P> There were some effectively old-fashioned wrinkles as well . Jerry Lewis was not on the scene , but his presence was everywhere . American audiences might have been able to recognize the outlines of one of his Labor Day telethons hovering in the ozone over JFK Stadium . There were the earnest testimonials from world figures ( Bishop Desmond Tutu , Coretta King , Pel and Linus Pauling ) . Phone numbers for call-in pledges appeared frequently . There were also , of course , the performers , trotted on according to strict show-biz standards : lightweights draw the day shift , heavies get prime time .
