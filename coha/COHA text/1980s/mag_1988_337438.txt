The debate in the House of Commons was heated and noisy , so naturally the Honorable Member from Brent East was in the thick of it . Discussing the deaths of suspected terrorists in Northern Ireland , Ken Livingstone suggested that the British Attorney General was an " accomplice to murder . " Tories shouted , " Withdraw ! Withdraw ! " and the Speaker admonished the Labor M.P. , demanding that he rephrase his comment . As Livingstone sat silently unrepentant , the Commons voted to oust him from the chamber . A sword-bearing sergeant at arms escorted him out the door . <P> The suspension lasted only five days , and by last week Livingstone was back in the House , ready to continue declaiming , posturing and in general living up to his reputation as Parliament 's most outrageous figure .

When Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher won a third * five-year term last year , Livingstone and others on Labor 's " loony left " got much of the blame for the Conservatives ' success . <P> The son of a chorus girl , Livingstone worked as a lab technician before entering politics . He became a folk hero for many Laborites in 1981 , when he was elected leader of the Greater London Council . Livingstone turned the council , responsible for such matters as public transit , garbage collection and social welfare projects , into the biggest-spending local government Britain had ever seen . He attracted headlines by doling out tax funds to every group imaginable , including a gay community center , a Welsh harp society , a graffiti workshop and an organization called Babies Against the Bomb . The council declared London a nuclear-free zone , earning plaudits from the Kremlin . <P> While Livingstone won wider support for slashing subway and bus fares , his policies infuriated many Britons .

His fellow Labor M.P.s shunned him , but party rank and file later elected him to a seat on Labor 's ruling council . <P> In his maiden Commons speech , Livingstone angered the House by accusing British security services of atrocities in Northern Ireland , one of his favorite issues . In November , after a bomb planted by the Irish Republican Army killed eleven people in the town of Enniskillen , Livingstone caused another furor by saying Ulster was Britain 's Viet Nam and predicting that the I.R.A . would win the conflict . Livingstone defied Kinnock by demanding that Britain cut its defense budget and withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization . By warning of a civil war within the party , he embarrassed Kinnock into dropping plans for a review of Labor 's nonnuclear defense policy .
