Billed as a seminar on the Constitution , " The Making of America " is more a churchy patriotic meeting than a scholarly dissertation . Sessions open with a presentation of military colors , followed by soloists belting out The Battle Hymn of the Republic and audiences singing God Bless America . When W. Cleon Skousen , 74 , steps onto the podium , he preaches that the authors of the Constitution intended the U.S. to be governed as a Christian republic " under the law of God . " As he explained to a rapt gathering of 800 in Anchorage two weeks ago , " The Founding Fathers wanted to separate church and state but not religion and state , and not God and state . " <P> A former Salt Lake City police chief who had teenagers arrested for smoking on the street , Skousen was sacked in 1960 shortly after he raided a card game that included the mayor . Skousen has run his seminars for more than a decade , accusing historians and liberals of lying about the meaning of the Constitution , ignoring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " testament . <P> In promoting his seminars , Skousen touts his links to Ronald Mann , deputy staff director of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the U.S. Constitution . Mann is a former board member of Skousen 's National Center for Constitutional Studies . He provided historical engravings for a textbook by Skousen , although he insists he has nothing to do with supporting Skousen 's seminars . The textbook , also titled The Making of America , is being sold by the California Commission on the Bicentennial . <P> Last week the liberal watchdog group People for the American Way cautioned the national Bicentennial Commission against Skousen . It argued , in the words of David Crane , a director , " An extremist group , extremist statements and extremist dialogue tend to threaten the heritage of our Founding Fathers and Founding Mothers . " Former Chief Justice Warren Burger , who has made a point of keeping politics out of the bicentennial proceedings , will be studying the matter .                  @ @ @
