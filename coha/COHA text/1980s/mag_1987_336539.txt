" I 've never been a quitter , " said the Rev. Jerry Falwell , choking back tears . But quitter he was last week , exhausted by unending financial woes and attacks from believers who opposed his rule at the PTL Christian conglomerate . The final straw was a decision by Federal Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds that Falwell 's financial rescue plan did not accommodate creditors and contributors . Reynolds suggested that Falwell should control only , say , five of nine PTL board members . Convinced that new board members might help restore the defrocked Jim Bakker , Falwell resigned , along with top administrators and current board members . The entire affair , said Falwell , washing his hands of it , has become the " Watergate of Evangelical Christianity . " <P> Or the tar baby . Ever since Bakker was caught in an adultery scandal and gave Falwell custody of his empire , the two have been flailing away at each other . At stake , beyond whatever should be rendered to God , are the sprawling Heritage USA theme park , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotels , a shopping mall and other oddments based in Fort Mill , S.C . The empire is worth $170 million but has debts of $62 million . During his 204-day rule , Falwell managed to raise $23 million but failed to rally the 114,000 " Lifetime Partners . " They had sent Bakker contributions of $165 million in return for a lifelong guarantee of three nights ' free lodging a year at Heritage USA . Bakker had hopelessly oversold available space . Some Partners objected to Falwell because they are Bakker admirers ; more did so because they are Pentecostals . They saw Falwell as a usurper who had long opposed that exuberant style of faith . <P> After Falwell filed his bankruptcy plan , creditors carped over the slow repayment schedules . The Lifetime Partners agitated for a return on their investment , and were not mollified by such offers as discounts on Heritage enterprises or stock in a new for-profit corporation that would develop real estate and begin selling ads on the TV network . The judge 's ruling , said Falwell angrily , made it likely that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bakker would return to run PTL within six months . In the febrile world of evangelistic TV fund raising , as in TV generally , the show can not go on without a star like Bakker . <P> Some suspected that Falwell 's move was a ploy to get the judge to back down . But the Fundamentalist minister has ample reason to escape the PTL quagmire and pay closer heed to his troubled operations in Lynchburg , Va . Faced with a recent decline of $5.4 million in contributions to his own TV ministry , Falwell has just stopped purchasing time from 50 of the 340 stations that carry his show . Bakker and his wife Tammy Faye , basking in the resignation news at their mountaintop home near Gatlinburg , Tenn. , said they were certainly willing to return if the creditors wished . Of course , Bakker could face a court hearing or two of his own , what with a federal grand jury and various investigators on the prowl.                   @ @
