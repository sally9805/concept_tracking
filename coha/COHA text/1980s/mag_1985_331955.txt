" You can buy now and then a Senator or a Representative ; but they do not know it is wrong , and so they are not ashamed of it . " So says a cynical newspaperman to an equally cynical speculator in The Gilded Age by Mark Twain and Charles Dudley Warner . The speculator , though , sees virtues in the corrupt system : " We would have to go without the services of some of our ablest men , sir , if the country were opposed to  --  to  --  bribery . It is a harsh term . I do not like to use it . " John T. Noonan Jr. , 58 , professor of law at the University of California , Berkeley , feels quite differently about the term . In a monumental new book bluntly titled Bribes ( Macmillan ; $29.95 ) , he applies the word to figures as distinguished as Francis Bacon and Thomas a Becket , and to a whole array of U.S. Presidents : Monroe , Garfield , Johnson , Nixon . Noonan 's 5,000-year chronicle of scandals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his demonstration of how the whole concept of bribery has evolved . <P> Noonan inevitably begins by attempting a definition : " A bribe is an inducement improperly influencing the performance of a public function meant to be gratuitously exercised . " Fair enough , but what is an inducement ? What is improper ? At the very dawn of human society , Noonan argues , the offering of gifts for reciprocal services was a commonplace sign of good intentions . A roving tribesman might offer some bright stone to a stranger simply to show that he meant no violence . The most important strangers to be courted with such gifts were the divine forces that brought rain or wind , hence the tradition of sacrifices left hopefully on an altar . The results of such efforts could be vexing . The Lord accepted Abel 's offering of sheep but mysteriously rejected Cain 's fruit of the ground , and Cain , according to Genesis 4 : 5 , " was very wroth . " <P> The first judges who undertook to settle disputes were priestly figures credited with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts from litigants . The words for such offerings  --  shohadh in Hebrew or munus in Latin  --  were ambiguous ; none of the classical languages had a specific term for a corrupting gift . Theoretically , even in Roman law a judge could accept contributions from both sides and still rule justly . Not until 1535 did Miles Coverdale use a Middle English term for stolen objects to translate a passage in Ecclesiastes as " all brybes and unrighteousness . " <P> King James I called on any citizen who knew of bribery of his judges to make a public accusation . One of the first to complain , John Wrenham , charged in 1617 that the learned Lord Chancellor Bacon had unfairly ruled against him . When Wrenham was unable to prove bribery , however , both his ears were cut off , after which he was " perpetually imprisoned . " Four years later , Bacon finally confessed to a whole array of bribes , and Parliament fined him ( pounds ) 40,000 and sentenced him to the Tower . The King majestically commuted the penalties . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a King himself was completely immune to bribery charges , but the American authors of the Constitution changed the rules . Article II specified that the President and " all civil officers " of the U.S. could be impeached for " treason , bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors . " Not until 1853 , however , was there a specific law against bribing a Congressman .
