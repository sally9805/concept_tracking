Stepping off the elevator into a tiny hall , looking for First ACT , a visitor finds four doors . One bears the name of a real estate broker . Another warns not to use stairs except in an emergency . A third is blank , and a fourth has a sign which says , " If door is locked , please knock loudly . " Doing so , one is rewarded with the sound of a child ' s voice asking , " Who ' s there ? " // The door opens on a virtual platoon of leaping youngsters ( actually half a dozen ) , practicing a dance from the current production . Beyond them in the theater another dozen on stage practice lines , while in a corner , clustered around a piano , more learn songs for the next production. // The organized pandemonium continues in the rehearsal rooms . An intern washes costumes in a large sink , while several cast members help each other with upcoming role changes . Producer-director Meridee Stein , oblivious to the hubbub , watches a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " She ' s going to be the Goat , " she says . Pointing to one boy she adds , " He ' s the current Goat , and he , " pointing to another , " is a past Goat . " As he flashes an impish grin she explains , " He was removed for disciplinary problems . Now he ' s back in the chorus. " // The current production , " The Children ' s Crusade , " is based on the attempt by thousands of children in 1212 to free Jerusalem from the Saracens . In writing it , Richard Peasley and Kenneth Cavander have spent six months talking with the cast , discussing with them what about the Crusade was especially appealing , what types of children would leave their homes , what kinds of feelings they would have , and what it was like to live at that time. // " The types of things the children shared with Dick and Kenneth helped them focus their efforts , " says Ms. Stein. // The shifting of parts is common . First ACT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole . Actors are not singled out in the program , and a lead in one play will likely have a minor part in another . Even interviews with cast members are discouraged. // First ACT began in 1969 after Ms. Stein , who had studied at England ' s Royal Shakespeare Company and had seen its repertory work , decided to develop a company for young people . She was particularly interested in combining " the Broadway swinging musical extravaganza type thing and the nurturing ability of a repertory company to foster the development of performers and staff . " The company , which began performing in the basement of a neighborhood church , now has its own theater half a block from Lincoln Center. // Productions range from " The Incredible Feeling Show " by Elizabeth Swados to " Grownups , " which Ms. Stein calls an interpretation of or reaction to adults by children in a gentle , humorous , meaningful way . What they have in common in quality  --  something First ACT has had to struggle to prove. // " The reaction to children ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaah , kid ' s stuff , ' " says Ms. Stein . " The attitude toward children has also been bizarre . There has been either an attitude very negative  --  spoiled brat with stage mother exploiting child  --  or , at the other extreme , untalented , amateurish , can ' t be any good. // " What ' s missing , what people don ' t know about , is the concept of repertory . This is the environment that trains the creative artist , that takes the talent and gives the technique by forming a partnership with the adult professional. " // She says it has taken a long time to get the attitude toward First ACT to be one of respect  --  not respect because they ' re children , but because the work is good. // " I ' m interested in quality , in theater that works , that ' s exciting , dynamic , and executed to the nth degree on a professional level . This is what I insist on in my company . If they don ' t have that drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re not going to get along . And we know that very quickly. " // Many children can not take First ACT ' s incredible demands : work from 4 to 7 p. m . Tuesdays through Fridays and from 10 a. m. to 6 p. m . Saturdays and Sundays. // Andrea Schwartz , now a theater major in college , was in the company for ten years , starting as a Munchkin in " The Wizard of Oz . " She says she never had difficulty keeping up with schoolwork. // " I started when I was 7 , so it ' s always been a regular thing , " she says . " It gives you a lot of discipline  --  much stronger than a lot of 11- year-old kids have . Besides , a lot of kids just play from 4 to 6 . We rehearsed. " // " Not everybody wants to do this , " Meridee Stein says . " Some kids come here and don ' t last a day . But for those who do , it ' s heaven. // " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of a second home . Along with the discipline was the very important feeling of being a family , " Andrea says. // First ACT is also helping develop learning programs with schools . An ethinc heritage program , run with the help of the Department of Education and the Fordham University Learning Center , has First ACT training students of Dominican , Jamaican , and Haitian backgrounds to do a series of ethnic heritage plays to make their culture come alive in the city . Another , helping children learn to read through the performing arts , uses plays as a way to explore work done in the classroom. // " We are not an educational institutions , " says Ms. Stein . " But by the same token I feel strongly that if you can enrich children ' s lives by exposing them to the arts , then let ' s try it. " // But her focus is on training young professionals for American musical theater. // " In England , one of the things that struck me was that there were young people working with professionals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They were respected . It didn ' t matter how old they were or how long this other Shakespearean actor was there , they were working together. // " The point is to get families to come into the theater to observe a great American resource  --  talented children  --  at work doing material that ' s not overly frightening or indiscreet , things that are appropriate yet challenging . I hope to get a theater center that marries adult professionals with gifted , talented young people to create fabulous theater . That would satisfy me. " // //
