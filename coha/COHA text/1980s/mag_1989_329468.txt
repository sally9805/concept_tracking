Eighteen bombings rocked Bogota last week as the cocaine warlords stepped up their counterattack against the government 's crackdown on drug traffickers . But the frightened citizens of Colombia were also rattled by word that Justice Minister Monica de Greiff had resigned her post , just two months after taking the job . De Greiff , 32 , quit after receiving numerous death threats to herself , her Argentine husband and their three-year-old son . <P> While a disappointment to some , De Greiff 's resignation was not unexpected . Before visiting the U.S. in late August , she handed President Virgilio Barco Vargas an open-dated resignation . Barco requested that she stay on until he found a replacement . Last week he did , naming Communications Minister Carlos Lemos Simmonds as the interim Justice Minister . If Lemos Simmonds agrees to accept the post formally , he will be Colombia 's ninth Justice Minister in three years .
