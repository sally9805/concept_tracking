The symbolism was as inescapable as the irony . When the five Central American Presidents gathered last week in the resort town of Tela in northern Honduras , their meeting place was a seaside compound once owned by the United Fruit Co. , the U.S. multinational concern that long represented the essence of gringo imperialism in the region . There , the Presidents* negotiated the dissolution of the Nicaraguan contras , a force that to many Central Americans symbolized U.S. arrogance and interference during the 1980s . When the Presidents emerged from three days of deliberations , they had signed an agreement on a specific series of steps to demobilize the contras within the next four months . <P> The so-called Tela Declaration was a gesture that carried all the moral authority of the region 's leaders but none of the military force that might be needed to make it stick . Its realization hinges on the " voluntary " cooperation of the contras and assigns responsibility for implementation to the United Nations and the Organization of American States . <P> Still , the latest attempt to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , which has supported and guided the contra effort since its inception in 1981 . Right up to the last minute , the Bush Administration lobbied regional leaders to postpone demobilization until after the Nicaraguan election , scheduled for Feb. 25 , to give the Sandinista regime at least some incentive to uphold its pledges for a free and fair vote . <P> But as the contra war winds down to a whimper , so too does a U.S. policy that preoccupied the Reagan Administration through two terms . The seeds of disengagement were sown last April , when President Bush secured $49.75 million in nonlethal aid for the contras in exchange for a guarantee that Congress could review  --  and sever  --  the aid package this November . Since many in Congress support the Central American leaders ' desire to disband the contras , the Bush Administration seemed to capitulate without a fight . " Our intention is to play it straight and stick with the ( ( peace ) ) process , " said a State Department official . " We 're not going to stand in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will complete the gradual mutation of the contras from a military threat to a political force to a refugee remnant that U.S. officials have dubbed the " disposal problem . " The Tela plan invites contras and their families to return to Nicaragua from their bases in Honduras but offers the option of resettlement in other countries . Honduras desperately wants the contras to go elsewhere , and Nicaragua has offered to repatriate them safely . But if the contras do not trust such Sandinista promises , the U.S. will face the painful question of its responsibilities toward the rebel force it created . <P> Much to the dismay of the contras , the demobilization plan enjoys the support of Nicaragua 's 20 opposition parties . To ensure their cooperation , President Daniel Ortega Saavedra pledged to suspend Nicaragua 's military draft until after the election , to hold fair balloting and to grant opposition candidates free television time . But the U.S. remains skeptical that the election will really prove free or fair , and last week 's agreement provides no penalties whatsoever should Ortega renege on his pledges . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
