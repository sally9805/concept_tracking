But in fact , it is revealing and even moving . Many of the paintings , photographs and lithographs have something to say about what it means to be a Chinese artist in New York . The works are defined by discretion , a strong feeling for craft and materials and a belief in art as a way of participating in something larger . Memory is of paramount importance. // Nevertheless , the exhibition , organized by Chen Dan Qing , a painter , and presented by the Chinese-American Arts Council , should have been more professional . No information is provided about the age of the artists , the length of time they have been in the United States or whether they were trained in China , the United States or both . Interviews , or a statement about the living conditions of the artists , would have been welcome . At a time when many Western artists are drawn to the conceptual framework of Chinese esthetics , it would be useful to know why many contemporary Chinese artists are drawn to Western Realism. // // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always present . Pa Sui Ma made four watercolor sketches of the Hudson River Palisades , then selected one and used it as the basis of a Pop-colored , three-part , watercolor screen in which the cliffs of New Jersey are ironically transformed into steep , unassailable Chinese mountains. // Gao Jin is fascinated by light . In " The Light , " the oil inside the paint seems to be burning . In " Dusk , " a woman who is little more than a spot of yellow rides a hay wagon , pulled by a yak , followed by a dog , with huge green hills rising up behind her . Conceived in the fastest American city , this painting moves with the slow , heavy rhythms of another world. // In the still lifes of Ying Ying Zhu , set against plain , wine-colored backgrounds similar to those in still lifes of Manet , there are further signs of uprootedness and difference . When peaches and pears are placed in baskets or bowls , the containers seem to become vessels and the fruit like boat people . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any place that will take them in. // In traditional Chinese painting and throughout this show , pictorial method matters profoundly . In Hong Nian Zhang ' s " Long , Long Thoughts of Youth , " a woman in shepherd clothes walks silently with her child . If the style and subject matter bear traces of Soviet Social Realism , the work is saved by the sheer force of its texture . Paint is used to recapture the rough , knobby , run-down wood fence behind the walking figures , as well as the hill behind it. <> <> // In the two realistic portraits by Quan Wu Li , brushwork is perceived as the vehicle through which essential currents are channeled into the image . In both portraits there is an awareness of the possibilities of abstraction . In " Portrait II , " one loose , flowing , inky curl of hair unlocks the warm iciness , or icy warmth , of the woman . In " Portrait I , " a pearl or shell earring sets in motion a compositional play that almost takes off on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman the painter wants to understand and depict. // There is a similar feeling for abstraction in " Landscape " by C. C. Wang - the best-known artist in the show - whose hills and stones pull against tiny clusters of blue-roofed houses , almost becoming independent of the imagery , but ultimately building into the work a feeling of wrathful immensity. // In his portrait photographs , Hong Qing Ling uses geometric patterns to create a sense of definition and clarity . The sense of abstraction is no less prominent in the cityscapes of Vivian Tsao , where a Jane Freilicher-like tension between three-dimensional space and decor triggers a Chinese meditation on illusion and reality . Beneath the flat surface of this show , there is depth . ( At the City Gallery , 2 Columbus Circle , through Sept. 4 . ) <> <> MAX COLE AND JUNKO YODA <> Zabriskie Gallery 724 Fifth Avenue ( at 56th Street ) Through Sept. 19 // This two-person show is one of the more serious gallery endeavors this summer . What links the striped paintings of Max Cole and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling for pattern and surface and an approach to abstraction inspired by landscape. // Like others of her Minimalist generation , Ms. Cole uses a grid , but she is determined to bring to her impersonal format a personal , irrational touch . Each of her six paintings consists of alternating horizontal rows . Half the rows are deep , solid color ; half are lighter and composed of hundreds of tiny vertical gestures that are never perfectly upright or straight. // Within the Minimalist format , there is therefore a touch of Abstract Expressionism . There is also considerable room for variation . Space can be pulled taut , left slack or allowed to buckle . The rows can suggest natural forms like grass and dunes , as well as Venetian blinds or filmstrips . The light in the paintings can seem as natural as daylight or as unnatural as the lurid , urban environments of Ed Paschke. // One strength of the show is the juxtaposition of " Aspen " and " Shaman , " which face each other across a room . " Aspen " is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its white strips create a feeling of cold , snowy light . " Shaman " is all night . It is largely black . It is the one painting by Ms. Cole in which there seems to be something behind the surface , pushing against it , promising something ritualistic and magical. // Ms. Yoda paints on rice paper sent to her from her native Japan , which she may tie in bows and attach to panels . Her rippling , wavy all-over patterns can be as lush and obsessive as Japanese screens . The feeling of looking down at an image from far above and at the same time being right up close to it may create a sense of vertigo. // There can also be something disconcerting in the imagery . These ebullient pictorial fields can be threatened by submarines or helicopters built up from cheesecloth and projecting from the surface , like figures and costumes in paintings by Nicholas Africano . In " Stream , " two eyes stare out at us above a body of water shaped like one of Matisse ' s reclining female nudes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Lilies " of Monet , others have an edginess that is more suggestive of the " drip " paintings of Pollock . There is an imagination here . <> <> LINDA PEER ' PILE OF HEADS ' <> New Museum of Contemporary Art 583 Broadway ( near Prince Street ) Through Sept. 4 // The summer show in the Broadway window of the New Museum is an installation by Linda Peer . On a bed of sand , framed by white walls , the sculptor has piled roughly 100 deep green stoneware heads and feet , all of them incised . The heads , like the feet , were made from three different molds . All the heads are androgynous ; all were modeled on Greek , African and Oriental types . The expressions range from restrained horror to beatific calm. // While the idea is promising , the installation does not work . The problems are those of Ms. Peer ' s sculpture in general . For one thing , the heads are without conviction . They emerge neither from a representational need , nor from a desire for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nor from a passion for camp or kitsch. // Nor is there conviction in the patterns drawn into the heads and feet . These stick figures , body parts , words like " love me , " " my heart " or " hope fear hope pain , " are signs of a self-conscious wish to reconcile a sensibility drawn to the East with the hipness of New York City streets . At this point , the two sides do not strengthen the work but pull it apart . Ms. Peer might be better off following one direction only and letting the other become part of the work on its own. //
