The Justices , in a 6-to-3 vote , reversed a Federal appellate court ' s ruling that upset Federal regulations exempting most airlines from detailed antidiscrimination rules . Those regulations had been challenged by groups representing handicapped passengers. // The fact that airlines benefit from Federal aid to airports and the Federal air traffic control system , the Supreme Court ruled , does not bring them under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 , which bars discrimination against handicapped people in " any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance. " // Only airlines that actually receive Federal financial aid are covered by the law in their on-board activities , Associate Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr. wrote in the majority opinion . Only a few small airlines receive such aid . <> <> Reagan Administration ' s Victory // The decision today also appears to affect three other similarly worded Federal civil rights laws , which bar discrimination on grounds of race , sex and age . It would appear that those laws , too , would apply only to recipients of direct or indirect Federal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had appealed the Federal appellate decision. // Today ' s ruling was based in part on the Court ' s ruling in the 1984 Grove City College case , which accepted the Administration ' s narrow reading of a similarly worded Federal law that bars sex discrimination by colleges that receive Federal money . The Court ruled then that the law barred sex discrimination only in those departments or programs that received Federal aid , not by a college as a whole. // Legislation pending in Congress to overrule the 1984 decision has broad support but has been stalled by a dispute over a relatively minor abortion regulation . Supporters of the legislation said they hoped the decision today would give it new impetus. // The Court ' s ruling may be important chiefly as a legal precedent exempting from antidiscrimination laws activities by private concerns that benefit from Federal programs but do not directly receive Federal money or other aid. // It will probably have little immediate practical effect on air travel by handicapped people . They have a general , vaguely worded right not to be discriminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was not challenged in the case decided today. // But Arlene Battis , alawyer with the Paralyzed Veterans of America , which had challenged the Department of Transportation regulations , said today that full Section 504 coverage was needed to prevent some airlines from continuing such practices as requiring handicapped people to have attendants with them when they fly and to sit on blankets in case they are incontinent. // Even if the decision had gone the other way , it would not have required airlines to make costly structural alterations to planes to accommodate handicapped people . <> <> Appeals Court ' s Ruling // A three-judge Federal appeals court panel here had ruled that the law covered all commercial air travel because airlines benefited so pervasively from Federal assistance to airports. // Justice Powell said this reasoning was contrary to the intent of Congress , for it would give section 504 " almost limitless coverage , " drawing in " whole classes of persons and businesses with only an indirect relation to aviation , " as well as trucking concerns that use federally financed interstate highways and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually receive the aid , " he said . They only benefit from airports ' use of the aid. " // Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall , in a dissent joined by Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr. and Harry A. Blackmun , said commercial airlines that required handicapped passengers to submit to conditions not imposed on other passengers " discriminatorily deny the handicapped the benefits of federally funded programs or activities supporting the airport and airway system. " // He said airlines " necessarily act as gatekeepers controlling who shall enjoy , and under what conditions , important benefits under federally funded and conducted programs. " // Chief Justice Warren E. Burger and Associate Justices Byron R. White , William H. Rehnquist , John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day O ' Connor joined the majority opinion in the case , United States v. Paralyzed Veterans , No. 85-289. // The Court also took these actions today : Food Stamp Rules The Justices voted 6 to 3 to uphold amendments to the Federal Food Stamp Program that make it harder for parents , children and siblings who live in the same home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of unrelated people who live in the same home. // The amendments , enacted by Congress in 1981 and 1982 to protect against fraud and abuse , generally treat parents , children and siblings who live together as a single household , even if they do not buy food and prepare meals together , assigning them smaller benefits than they would receive if they were treated as separate households. // In the case , Lyng v. Castillo , No. 85-250 , the Justices reversed a Federal District Court in Texas and upheld the amendments as a " rational " way of seeking to prevent fraud or mistakes in a huge program . <> <> Sex Discrimination // The Court unanimously ruled that a Federal appellate court should not have blocked an investigation by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission of a sex discrimination complaint by a former teacher against a religious school. // The case , Ohio Civil Rights Commission v. Dayton Christian Schools , No. 85-488 , began when a teacher at Dayton Christian Schools became pregnant and school officials told her she could not work the following year because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay home with small her chldren. // When the teacher consulted a lawyer , she was dismissed . She filed a sex discrimination charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission , but the school obtained an order from a Federal appellate court barring the commission from proceeding against it. // The appellate court said enforcement of the sex discrimination law against the school would violate its First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and the separation of church and state. // Justice Rehnquist wrote for the High Court that the lower Federal courts should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over the case because of the need to respect " comity and Federalism . " Four members of the Court did not join his opinion but agreed that Federal court intervention at the investigative stage was premature. //
