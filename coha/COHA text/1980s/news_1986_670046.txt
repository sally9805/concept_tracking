SYDNEY , Australia  --  Elders IXL Ltd. , apparently taking the role of a white knight , plunged into the long-running takeover battle for Broken Hill Proprietary Co. by snapping up 16. 6% of BHP for nearly $1 billion . BHP , a steel and resources concern and Australia ' s biggest company , is the target of a hostile bid by Australian investor Robert Holmes a Court that would give him effective control of the company . Analysts said Elders ' s purchase appears to have at least temporarily halted Mr. Holmes a Court ' s bid . Elders ' s purchase of 180 million BHP shares on the Australian stock market created the biggest single-day volume ever in an Australian stock and spurred trading in other shares . Australia ' s All Ordinaries index posted a record gain , surging 44. 1 points , to 1198 . Total market volume , at $1. 15 billion , was more than four times higher than the previous record . In a statement to the country ' s stock exchanges , Elders , an Australian brewer and farming concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said further announcements would follow . Elders ' s chairman , John Elliott , called the purchase a " sound strategic investment . " BHP ' s managing director , Brian Loton , said the company was contacted by Elders and told that it was buying BHP shares . " Elders said they were long-term investors , " Mr. Loton said . BHP also said a meeting has been called for today to discuss the new development . In describing Elders as a white knight , analysts noted that BHP played a similar role for Elders last year , when it bought a stake that Mr. Holmes a Court held in Elders . Mr. Holmes a Court , who has made four bids for BHP since 1983 , is currently offering about $1. 4 billion for about 20% of the company . He already holds 18. 8% of BHP , and a successful bid would give him effective control . Brokers and analysts said Elders acquired the 16. 6% stake at $5. 30 a share . They said Elders had little trouble in buying the stake because institutions were willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go through the long process of a formal takeover . Elders is expected to continue buying BHP shares today . An Australian company can acquire as much as 19. 9% of another company without making a formal takeover offer . Table Now that a large amount of BHP shares are in apparently friendly hands , analysts speculated that Mr. Holmes a Court may turn his sights on Elders . And there were market rumors that Elders and BHP may merge . In London , Andrew Cummins , group director of strategy at Elders , declined to comment on whether the companies would merge . <> Australian analysts also said that Elders ' s buying spree may have signaled the end of its aspirations to take over Allied-Lyons PLC , a British food and beverage company . Elders ' s bid , valued at about $2. 65 billion , has lapsed pending review by Britain ' s Monopolies and Mergers Commission . But Mr. Cummins said Elders still hopes to acquire Allied-Lyons , which last week agreed to acquire for $2. 6 billion ( Canadian ) the spirits and wine business of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t dismantled any of our bank lines assembled to acquire Allied-Lyons , " Mr. Cummins said . " They ' re still in place . " But he said Allied-Lyons ' s agreement to acquire the Hiram Walker unit " amounts to a giant-size poison pill . Allied-Lyons can ' t make the acquisition without a substantial dilution of their shares . " On the Sydney Stock Exchange , BHP ' s shares climbed 53 cents a share , to $5. 27 , while Elders gained 54 cents , to $3. 24 . Mr. Holmes a Court ' s takeover vehicle , Bell Resources Ltd. , fell four cents , to $3. 45 . Credit : Special to The Wall Street Journal
