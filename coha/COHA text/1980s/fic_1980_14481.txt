The stage is a " Pantages " of passion , a " Bijou " of dreams and a " Roxy " of romance . Saturday night finds the BROTHERS ( Fourteen Karat Soul ) sitting in the back row of the late show . The movie begins . They are silhouetted in the projector light . They 're eating popcorn . Setting the scene for us is the PHANTOM OF DOO-WOP , resplendent in white tie , cape and tails . Sitting in his private red plush box at the edge of the stage , he adds just that measure of high-brow elegance we need for a night at the Doo-Wop Opera . The PHANTOM OF DOO-WOP tells us:On a Saturday nightIn the June moonlightAn a capella Doo-Wop GroupFrom GuadeloupeNew JerseyIs into seeing somethingGroovy In the manner ofA movie The BROTHERS sing the " Suzie Vamp " and over it we hear the " Bass Rap " It came togetherMe and my movieHow could I falterWith you as my lead ?
