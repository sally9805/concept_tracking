As Mike Bossy glided around the // practice rink , he glanced into // the bleachers and commented : " I ' ve never seen so many adults here . Must be something going on. " // Bossy ' s practiced eye told him that many of the 50 adults in the Cantiague Park rink were hockey officials and reporters there to catch every little nuance of the first practice of Pat LaFontaine and Pat Flatley with the New York Islanders. // All the players - not just the astute Bossy and Ken Morrow , the Olympian of four years ago - seemed well aware that these two Olympians might provide a jolt to a team seeking a fifth straight Stanley Cup championship. // No other sport has quite the same late-season infusion of talent , ready to step in and play , as hockey does after each winter Olympics . Basketball and football tap their college farm systems in the off-season , baseball blends in minor-leaguers when they are ready or needed , but hockey can count on a flow of North American players once every four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipeline was carefully maintained in recent years . Bill Torrey and his staff drafted Pat Flatley , a hard-digging forward , in the 1982 amateur draft and then selected Pat LaFontaine , a high-scoring center , in the 1983 draft . The assumption was always that they would report at the end of February , 1984 . Yesterday they arrived , right on schedule. // Ken Morrow , who joined the Islanders after playing for the United States team that won the Olympic gold medal in 1980 , could enjoy his nostalgia to the extent that neither new player is a defenseman . " I was just trying to remember what it was like , " he said . " I was so nervous , things just went by . I remember getting off a plane and going out to practice , just hoping to get time on the ice . The first week , everything will be hectic for them. " // The last year has been hectic for the two young men named Pat . ( " I ' ll have to get nicknames for them or else I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go out on the ice , " said the coach , Al Arbour . ) Flatley went from the University of Wisconsin to the Canadian Olympic team that finished fourth at Sarajevo , Yugoslavia . LaFontaine went from Verdun in the top junior league in Canada to the American team that finished seventh in the Olympics . Yesterday they both went through // the obligatory meet-the-press // show at the Nassau Coliseum before they could have the release of their first professional workout . Flatley wore his new uniform , No. 8 , and smiled as Torrey explained , " Pat has always worn No. 26 , so No. 8 is really 2 and 6 for those of you who don ' t function well in the morning. " // Torrey joked that he had considered letting the Islanders ' No. 26 , Dave ( Bammer ) Langevin , and Flatley go into a locked room to see who emerged with the number . That tactic just might have produced one torn shirt and a mutual admiration society . Flatley gained a bit of notoriety at the Olympics for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Didn ' t do it , didn ' t do it , " Flatley said with a smile , as Arbour joked that he might be more careful about observing practice against the boards with Flatley around. // Flatley is a 6-foot-2-inch wing from Toronto , with a reputation for working hard in the corners . Torrey likened him to John Tonelli and Bob Nystrom , which means Flatley plays the Islanders ' style of hockey. // LaFontaine , who was able to claim his favorite No. 16 , barely lived up to his advertised height of 5-10 , and his age , 19 . He will live with a family on Long Island , just as he had lived with a family in Verdun while playing in the Quebec Major Junior league last season. // After the American team faltered in Sarajevo , there were comments from Lou Vairo , the American coach , that some of his players were " almost afraid to go home . " LaFontaine said yesterday that he had felt no shame from within or without. // " My reception was good , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Olympics . Sure , it would have been great to win the gold but the entire experience was great , not just the two weeks . I have fond memories of beating the Soviet team on tour . People understood . We just hit a slump at the wrong time. " // // Now the two young men switch from representing their countries to playing for the most successful sports team of the 1980 ' s , a team that has won four straight titles since Ken Morrow came home with his gold medal. // " I remember the first day I reported here , " Morrow said . " You hear about some teams making it rough on newcomers , but these are a great bunch of guys . They all made me feel welcome. " // Morrow remembered Dave Lewis , a defenseman popular with fans and teammates , greeting him on March 1 , 1980 . A week later , Lewis was gone with Billy Harris for Butch Goring in Torrey ' s nearly annual March shakeup. // He also remembered his first game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a penalty my first shift on the ice and the Red Wings scored a power-play goal and we lost the game . I remember wondering what the players and the fans and the press thought of me. " // Morrow now guesses that opponents " dumped the puck in my corner " to test him , " just the way quarterbacks always test a rookie cornerback. " // " Jean Potvin tells me they did the same thing to Bobby Orr in his first year , " Morrow continued . " You always want to see how good a new guy is. // " But I think it ' s different now than 10 years ago . You ' ve got a lot more young players in the league . Both Pat and Pat will be playing against a lot of guys their own ages . They ' ve played college hockey and junior hockey and Olympic hockey. // " Sure , it ' s different . In college , it ' s almost a job because you ' re on scholarship , but it ' s also a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ' re still young . But once you get here , it ' s a job and you work at it full time. " // The two Olympians handled themselves nicely against the spearing , tripping and holding tactics of the dreaded New York news media yesterday morning . For their reward , they got to practice with the Islanders in the afternoon . The long wait was over . They were now professionals. //
