Since the beginning of cinema , when the Lumiere Brothers caused a sensation with their film of a train pulling into a station , moviemakers have been fascinated with the processes and appurtenances of travel . Cowboys rode into the sunset , speeding locomotives raced against time , and Chaplin tottered toward the horizon down a dusty highway. // The trend reached a kind of pop epitome with the " road movie " craze that followed " Easy Rider " in the early 1970s . Since then , sharks and spaceships and spooks have inherited top position at the box office , but The Road remains a resonant subject at the movies . Current examples include the brand-new " Carny , " with Gary Busey and Robbie Robertson , and the coming " Honky Tonk Freeway , " now being filmed by John Schlesinger . Even the " Star Wars " movies are , in part , snappy travelogues on an intergalactic scale. // Now an enterprising company of film exhibitors  --  aptly called Roadmovies Inc.  --  has decided to pay a lightearted summer tribute to this worthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan will come alive with road movies of all shapes and sizes , from the classic and the colossal to the corny and the crazy . To be sure , a road is a road is a road . But a glance at the Roadmovies schedule indicates the tremendous diversity of ways in which filmmakers have been inspired by the idea of moving on. // For example , Dennis Hopper ' s " Easy Rider " is prominently on hand , as is Richard C. Sarafian ' s " Vanishing Point . " We ' re in pop-art country here , surrounded by speed and noise and the pursuit of hipness . Not far away is Monte Hellman ' s " Two-Lane Blacktop , " which has developed a strong cult reputation , and Paul Bartel ' s " Death Race 2000 , " which has been hailed as an example of pop iconography. // Lest one think that road movies and youth movies are identical phenomena , however , we don ' t have to look far to find Federico Fellini , who used the road of " La Strada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another great Italian director , Michelangelo Antonioni , used his own road motif in " The Passenger , " which also correlated an inner voyage with an outer voyage. // Among American filmmakers , none stand higher than Alfred Hitchcock , whose " North by Northwest " might be the ultimate travelogue  --  alternately hilarious and hair-raising , and barely survived by the hapless Cary Grant . John Ford , another Old Master of Hollywood , used Steinbeck ' s " Grapes of Wrath " as the core of one of his most celebrated films , in which desperate Okie migrations dramatize the passage of America through the great depression . Ford is also represented by " Two Rode Together , " one of his last and darkest pictures , with James Stewart as a cynical lawman who penetrates Indian territory while probing the cultural and emotional abyss separating red men and white men on the Western frontier. // In the middle 1970s , it looked like the road movie might give way to the rampage movie , particularly when Terrence Malick ' s " Badlands " came out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth . Other road-movie detours during the past few years include the absurdism of Frank Perry ' s " Rancho Deluxe , " the CB- bred camaraderie of Jonathan Demme ' s " Handle With Care , " and the sadistic ugliness of Sam Peckinpah ' s " Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia. " // Road movies can accommodate all kinds of characters , from the rural moonshiners of " White Lightning " and Arthur Ripley ' s " Thunder Road " to the angst-filled musicians of Bob Rafelson ' s " Five Easy Pieces " and the bitter lawbreakers of Fritz Lang ' s " You Only Live Once . " Major directors have tried road themes early in their careers  --  is Francis Ford Coppola ' s " The Rain People " a precursor of " Apocalypse Now " ?  --  and major stars have returned to the road whenever the box office beckoned , as witness Bob Hope and Bing Crosby in " Road to Morocco , " which closes the festival. // In Hollywood , Anthony Mann made " The Far Country , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the small but exquisite " Alice in the Cities , " which remains his strongest film . Meanwhile , Jean-Luc Godard brought his own Hollywood enthusiasms and European mannerisms to " Pierrot le fou , " which expresses all the mingled savagery and lyricism of his extraordinary moviemaking talent. // And don ' t forget what may be the most introspective road movie of them all : " Sullivan ' s Travels " by the great Preston sturges . After achieving fame and fortune with his early comedies , Sturges was tempted to emulate Frank Capra , turning to films that strain for " meaning " and " social awareness . " Instead , however , Sturges decided to follow the footsteps of Ernst Lubitsch , and help humanity simply by making humanity laugh . " Sullivan ' s Travels " is the story of a filmmaker who learns ( the hard way ) that the wisest man is the man with the most humor in his heart . It is an uproarious and touching film . And its refusal to flaunt its " meanings " makes it more meaningful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen. // After the road-movie festival ends , the Clurman Theater will revisit the films of George A. Romero , including the rarely screened " Jack ' s Wife " and two of Romero ' s sports documentaries . Then comes a rock ' n ' roll series , including D. A. Pennebaker ' s documentaries " Don ' t Look Back , " a revealing look at Bob Dylan , and " Monterey Pop . " To coincide with the national presidential conventions , the Clurman will show a group of election-year movies , such as " All the President ' s Men , " " Medium Cool , " " The Candidate , " Stanley Kubrick ' s " Dr. Strangelove , " Frank Capra ' s interminable " Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , " and Preston Sturges ' s rousing " The Great McGinty. " // Later , a series of Nicholas Ray films will unspool , including " Party Girl , " " Bigger Than Life , " and other studies by this most controversial of Hollywood " auteur " directors. // And then Roadmovies Inc. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Eastern European week , including six premieres , primarily of Polish and Czech features. // It promises to be a busy time at a busy and eclectic movie house. // //
