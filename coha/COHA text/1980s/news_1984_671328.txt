The tree was the brainchild of Gretta Graham , a secretary in the office of Senator William V. Roth Jr. , a Delaware Republican , who seized upon the idea to dramatize his crusade against waste , fraud and abuse in the Defense Department . The Senator had previously used a large elephant and " the world ' s largest apple pie " to dramatize the three- year 30 percent Roth-Kemp tax cut , as he calls it. // To some colleagues , the 63-year- old , three-term Senator , who is chairman of the Committee on Governmental Affairs , is in the tradition of two former Delaware Senators , John Williams and Caleb Boggs , who kept a sharp eye on Government expenditures. // " He ' s very effective , " said Senator Ted Stevens , Republican of Alaska , the majority whip , who is chairman of the military appropriations subcommittee and a member of the Governmental Affairs Committee . " Delaware sends us senators who are watchdogs of the Treasury . Bill is in the Delaware tradition . " <> <> Voices on Criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identified , view Senator Roth as a genial man whose penchant for publicity exceeds his other legislative skills . " With Roth it seems all show- biz , and not much follow-through , " said a Democratic Senator on his committee. // A Republican Senator on his committee said , " The committee hasn ' t done anything under his leadership , and Lord knows , there ' s plenty to do. " // Another Republican called Mr. Roth ' s Christmas tree approach " demagoguery , " adding , " If you add it up , it comes to $25-$30 million tops , out of a $260 billion budget. " // Mr. Roth stays in Washington only two or three nights a week , and some attribute the committee ' s lack of productivity to his part-time appearance . He occasionally telephones the Senate cloakroom from his Wilmington home to learn if he really needs to take the train to Washington to cast a vote . An aide to the Senator said Mr. Roth ' s approach was " instinctual . " Not a plodder , he will settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said. // The Senator , who wears a miniature Allen wrench as a tie clip , acknowledges that he has a flair for publicity . " You ' ve got to catch the attention of people , " he said . The publicity , he says , is an integral part of sincere and occasionally successful efforts to focus attention on national problems . Although Mr. Roth was generally regarded as the junior partner in the tax cut proposal , he was expert at publicizing the plan . To critics of the three-year , 30 percent reduction in tax rates , Mr. Roth points to the economic recovery and says it will take time for " Roth-Kemp " to reach its full effect . He is a leading supporter of tuition tax credits , which were passed by the Senate but died in the House . The Senator also has proposed a two-year budget system , with all agencies financed under a single spending bill . <> <> Focus on Arms Outlays // // These days his efforts are focused on the Pentagon . The Senator ' s committee is empowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is focusing on the military spending , he said , because " that ' s where the big bucks are . " His investigations have been aided by two retired Defense Department auditors who now work for his committee. // Mr. Roth says waste , fraud and abuse are built into the system of military spending . Because the military places a priority on delivery of weapons , " the individual procurement officer just ain ' t price-conscious , " he said . " A Navy captain told me , ' If it doesn ' t cost $10 million , it ' s not worth 10 minutes of my time. ' " // Pentagon waste is manifest in virtually all aspects of military spending , from cash management to operational testing , in Mr. Roth ' s opinion . " The big thrust is to develop and use new weapons , " Mr. Roth said . " It ' s the buy now , fix later syndrome . " The Senator argues that new systems need early testing because " these systems have a life of their own. " // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitive bidding . " One of the biggest problems is sole- sourcing , " he said . <> <> Independent Inspector General // // The Senator worked successfully for legislation to create an independent Inspector General in the Defense Department , with authority to initiate any investigation he seeks . However , the Secretary of Defense can stop the I.G. if he feels that an investigation threatens national security . In such cases , the Secretary must inform Congress of his action. // " The system does not reward those who are efficient and effective , " the Senator said . " Too often , the system wants to cover up inefficiencies. " // Occasionally , there is outright fraud , the Senator said , noting 77 , 000 allegations of fraud involving military contracts in a two and a half year period . Some military contractors misallocate labor costs , charging the Government for time spent on private contracts. // Mr. Roth is now working for a civil fraud penalties bill . He notes that Federal prosecutors have initiated action against only 7 percent of those accused of defrauding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosecute the tens of thousands of fraud cases that arise each year , he said. // As a result , he added : " It ' s like the income tax . People think they can play the odds . " Mr. Roth ' s proposal would give administrative law judges the authority to hear fraud cases and impose fines . These decisions could then be appealed in the Federal courts , under the Senator ' s plan. // " Today , there ' s no point in complaining of wrongdoing , " the Senator said . " Whistle-blowers risk their own necks , with no likelihood of prosecution. " // " The system is large , " the Senator continued , " We need to build the incentive to reward those who do a good job , and punish those who do poorly. " // //
