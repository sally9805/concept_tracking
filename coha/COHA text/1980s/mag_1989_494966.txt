Dog Days BY RICHARD JENKYNS when J. R. Ackerley died in 1967 , there was a mild elegiac flutter in the obituary columns . Joe , as his friends called him , was well known as a minor figure in the London literary world . He had been an outstanding literary editor of the BBC 's weekly magazine The Listener . In the 1920s he had written a play that ran hriefly in a fringe theater not far from the West End before being replaced by the aptly named The Desire for Change . He had published three slim volumes : a humorous account of a few months spent at the court of an Indian maharajah , and two books based on his life with his pet dog , one of which won a literary prize . Readers were liable to find that these works were rather different from what they had expected , and friends knew that each of them had to be altered to avoid prosecution for libel and obscenity ; but few people , perhaps , can have been fully prepared for Ackerley 's memoir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It revealed one of the queerest life stories of the 20th century . Ackerley 's father , Roger , was a self-made businessman who , with his partner Arthur Stockley , had made money in the banana trade . As in a bad novel , the two partners were almost comically contrasted . Stockley was solid and sober , author of Consciousness of Effort : the romance of the banana . Roger Ackerley was a jolly , coarse-grained man with a flair for flamboyant publicity . When the music-hall star Florrie Forde sang " Yes , we have no bananas , " he supplied her with bunches of the fruit . When the song " I 've never seen a straight banana " became popular , he offered L1,000 to anyone who could find one . ( He did not have to pay up . ) His son remembered his fondness for dirty jokes , his habit of scratching himself unpleasantly , and the way that he would sit in his armchair , reading his paper . " picking his nose abstractedly and rolling the little bit of snot between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side of Victorian and Edwardian life often neglected . Not all the wealthy bourgeoisie wanted to adopt the style of the gentry . In fact , the family was not perfectly respectable . Joe , who specialized in the insouciant telling of outrageous fact , began his memoir , " I was born in 1896 and my parents were married in 1919 . " An earlier draft began , " My father 's penis was twelve inches long . " His father 's penis was indeed the problem : in addition to his three children by Joe 's mother , Roger had another family of three daughters . Though the two families lived only a mile or two apart , Roger managed to keep his secret until his death . This extraordinary story has been told , from the other family 's point of view , by Diana Petre , one of Joe 's half sisters , in The Secret Garden of Roger Ackerley ; another of the half sisters became Duchess of Westminster . and Joe found late in life that he was brother-in-law to the richest man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life was to be more curious still . For one thing , he was a wildly promiscuous homosexual . It is hard to fathom the cause of this , and Peter Parker , a blessedly sensible and unfussy biographer , does not speculate . After a conventional schooling , Ackerley fought in the trenches and was twice wounded , first by his whiskey bottle , which was shattered by a shell , then in the buttock , where the injury suppurated painfully . In a bad novel both these wounds would be symbolic . After the war he went to Cambridge , and then joined the talks department of the BBC . The BBC 's director-general , Sir John Reith , was every bad novelist 's idea of a Calvinist Scot , craggy of face and over six feet tall ( " those wuthering heights , " Churchill said ) . Presumably he was not aware that Hilda Matheson , the head of the talks department , and both her assistants were homosexual . The occasion when the three of them produced a radio discussion on marriage between Hilda 's lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harold Nicolson , must have been rich in ironies . Meanwhile Ackerley had become friendly with E. M. Forster . Through Forster he spent a short period in India , in the sinecure post of secretary to the homosexual Maharajah of Chhatarpur . The maharajah was a comic little man with a snub-nosed face like a Pekingese , whose interests were divided between sexual practices too bizarre to be described in the pages of a quiet family magazine like this one and a rather touching desire for self-improvement ; life at Chhatarpur reads like a mixture of Evelyn Waugh 's Black Mischief and Ronald Firbank . The maharajah was strongly Anglophile , his great ambition being to wangle a knighthood out of King George V. He admired the masterpieces of English fiction ? Marie Corelli and Hall Caine ? and believed that Westerners had the key to the mysteries of the universe . Did God exist or not ? Here was G. H. Lewes who said one thing and Herbert Spencer who said the other ; would Ackerley please read both books and tell him who was right . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maharajah , already distressed by the news of Miss Corelli 's recent demise , was heartbroken . Joe concluded that what he really craved was love and affection . This episode became the subject of Joe 's first book , Hindoo Holiday . B ack in London , Ackerley moved sideways to The Listener , where he made the literary pages lively and sometimes risque , waging guerrilla warfare against what he saw as the moral and political stuffiness of the BBC 's establishment . " Joe came yesterday , very gloomy , " Forster told a friend once , " trouble with the new editor and muddle with the new guardsman . " That was pretty much the pattern of his life for many years . Parker describes several of his skirmishes with authority , including an occasion when three words had been excised from a piece by Leonard Woolf on the grounds that they cast a slur on the royal family . Woolf was furious with the " under-housemaid snobbery of the BBC " and their " servants ' hall standards , " oblivious to the grosser snobbery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private income . Ackerley had joined the Labour Party , but like some others of the literary left he had a considerable contempt for ordinary people . In the 1920s and 1930s. that was significant : many men of his class and his generation had seen the working classes at close quarters in the trenches , and learned to admire their courage and good humor . No doubt Ackerley 's louche waY of life encouraged a different view . His adventures were aided by his charm and his strikingly good looks ; but he paid most of the men he picked up , and his tastes took him into a twilight world of fugitives , odd coppers , dropouts , and petty criminals . He affected to despise the English middle class , but with no compensatory liking for their social inferiors . In We Think the World of You , one of his dog books ? technically it is his only novel , though it is really a lightly fictionalized account of his own experiences ? the working class is stupid and absurd . . Parker oddly believes that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would he say the same about Asian bar girls ? ) , and he seems barely to notice that Joe was also in the business of erupting teenagers . But Parker 's light touch is generally fitting . ' lhough Ackerley 's life was sordid , it was also blackly comic , partly because Ackerley himself made it so through the bleak gaiety with which he described it , partly because he had the habit of blundering into muddles more reminiscent of Feydeau than of homosexual intrigue . ( Parker has some farcical stories of stolen trousers and compromising letters retrieved from mailbags . ) Occasionally Ackerley became besotted with his bedfellows . The last of these larger passions was for a man whom Parker calls Freddie ( not his real name , though Parker nowhere tells us so ) . Freddie was a deserter from the army and a part-time burglar . ( His partner was a full-time burglar . but Freddie was too feckless to stick to anything . even crime . ) Ackerley had a fight on his hands , not only with Freddie 's hopeless untrustworthiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who seems to have been a gallant young woman coping bravely in grim circumstances . " Women are dangerous , " he wrote in My Dog Tulip , " especially women of the working class . " He thought of blackmailing her ( he had learned that she had a conviction for soliciting ) , then of murdering her . His plan was to scatter poisoned thumbtacks across her bedroom floor . She would get up in her bare feet , tread on one , and die of tetanus . ( It struck him that the pins might kill her infants as well , but with his feelings about children this did not seem a drawback . ) He bought some liver and experimented by sticking pins into it and leaving it in a drawer to rot . The plan came to nothing and later he wondered how seriously he had meant it . Still , one feels that Ackerley , like the late king John , was not altogether a good man . I t was through Freddie that he acquired Qieenie. his Alsatian dog , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became extravagantly devoted to this animal ( which most of his friends found disagreeably bad-tempered ) , and more or less gave up his pursuit of young men . His description of her is exquisite : Her cars are tall and pointed , like the ears of Anubis ... when she stands with her hack to the sun it shines through the delicate tissue , so that they glow shell-pink as though incandescent .. . . jet ... are the runs of her amber eyes , as though heavily mascarfed , and the tiny mobile eyebrow tufts that are set like accents above them .... Her skull ... is two primrose Pools , the center of her face light gray , ... her cheeks white , and upon each a pouf dr mouchr has been tastefully set . This is a poem of love , no doubt about it . I'he novelist Olivia Manning asked him straight out if he had sexual relations with the animal . " Just a little finger-work , " he murmured . He became enthralled by Qieenie 's sexual and excretory habits . The outcome was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fullness and frankness that make it unlike any other animal book . It also describes his ludicrous attempts to mate her with a pedigree Alsatian . But like her master , she preferred strays , and in the end a mongrel named Dusty fathered her eight puppies , who reduced Ackerlev 's apartment to more than usual squalor . Qneenie led him a dog 's life . A particularly absurd episode occurred when he took her with him to stay with Siegfried Sassoon . The two aging inverts made polite conversation during the day , each retiring in the evening to confide his dislike of the other to his diary . During the night Queenie defecated in the bedroom . Ackerley proudly observed how clever she had been in choosing a patch of dark carpet instead of the white pile rug . But her virtue was in vain . since the housemaid trod in the mess , spreading it onto the rug and over half the house . s carcely less bizarre was Joe 's relationship with his sister Nancy . This appalling and pathetic woman battened on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selfishness , and perhaps some mental instability into a boozed , neurotic wreck . Her aim , to get herself permanently installed in Joe 's apartment . was finally achieved by an attempt at suicide : he felt he had no choice but to take her in . Nancy and Queeniethe " two bitches " ? became furiously jealous of each other 's claim on him , and in his darker moments he would amuse himself by stirring things up . The cocktail of jealousy grew even headier when Joe 's Aunt Bunny , a music-hall style of hearty Cockney described as " a character entirely out of fiction , " joined the menage . Bunny became incontinent ; Joe advised sanitary towels , which Bunny washed and reused to save money , so that the whole apartment reeked of urine . Bunny died ; Queenie grew old and lost control of her bowels . What a stench comes out of that apartment in the course of this book ? a festering mess of piss , shit , rotting meat , whiskey , and hatred . Ackerley ' s last years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest in young men revived , but age made seduction harder . Sitting in a caf ? in Greece , he would wait until he saw a pretty boy , whip in his false teeth , and flash a dazzling smile ? a technique that met with small success . Short of money , he wrote to Forster soliciting a gift . and Forster rather sportingly sent ? 1,000 . Ackerley thought the sum inadequate and dreamed up another wheeze : noticing how frail his benefactor was looking , he wrote his obituary and hawked it round the Sunday newspapers . The money went mainly on whiskey . With scarcely any other pleasures left , he sat waiting for the " dear dark angel " to release him . Death came when he was 70 ; by a last bitter irony Nancy , whose possessiveness had done so much to spoil his later years , seemed much happier once he was gone . w hat was wrong with Ackerley ? By his own account he was torn between romantic and erotic impulses : in all the young men he took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend , " but was eternally frustrated because all the men he liked liked women . Parker accepts this story rather too easily . Many of his friends thought that he was incapable of love , including his half sister Diana , who , perhaps surprisingly , adored him . The pursuit of sex was cold and mechanical : having seen the wretched " slave markets " of Japan , he wrote to Forster , " Not really my cup of sake . Bad breath , I am told , no circumcision . " He seems to have forgotten that he is talking about human beings . Perhaps the more terrible truth is that he has not forgotten : these are only boys , not dogs . In later life he became a zealous , even fanatical advocate of what we would now call animal rights . This would be much to his credit , were it not so plain that his crusade for animals was a reflex of his bitterness against humanity . He hated the middle classes , the working classes , the English , the Americans , women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , animals apart . He seems to have been almost entirely self-absorbed . The reason that his early ambitions to be a playwright or novelist came to nothing was that he could never get beyond himself . All his books are autobiographical . And it is obvious that he was obsessed with dirt . Like other concerned citizens , he wrote to his local paper about dogs ' mess in the streets ; unlike most concerned citizens , he wanted more of it . ( It was so distressing for the poor creatures even to use the gutter . ) He took photographs of Queenie fouling the sidewalks , which he hoped to use in My Dog Tulip . He liked to think of Reith and the other heads of the BBC " all with their trousers down , sitting with their pale legs apart , having a GOOD SHIT , and I like it because I know they would not like me to think of it . " In part this seems merely retarded ; perhaps we should reach for Dr. Freud 's casebook after all . But it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I think that people ought to be upset , " he told Stephen Spender , " and if I had a paper I would upset them all the time ; I think that life is . . . so upsetting that nobody should be spared . " It is as though he wants to rub our faces in ? well , you know what . According to the publishers ' blurb , " Ackerley is a 20th-century exemplar of a time-honored English tradition : the odd individualist whose steadfast adherence to his peculiar way of seeing eventually becomes representative . " Ah yes , the rich historic tapestry of England : beefeaters and thatched cottages , buggers lurking in public lavatories . Another time-honored English tradition is devoting biographies to even the most minor literary figures . Sometimes it seems that anyone who ever took tea with Virginia Woolf has had his life slapped between hard covers . Parker 's book could easily have been a waste of time ; unexpectedly , it is a great success . Parker shares many of Ackerley 's own virtues as a writer ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weaves together the public and private strands of his subject 's life with assurance . This is a very funny book , but the humor is maca- ( v young marriage of a man he fancied ; Joe taking pleasure in the unhappiness of Sassoon 's estranged wife ; Roger 's wife and mistress both declining into alcoholic stupor ; Nancy 's son stranded with a stepmother in America and writing piteous pleas to his uncle for rescue ; Nancy herself twisting her life like a screw deeper and deeper into self-willed wretchedness . Parker plausibly suggests that even jolly Roger was a lonely man at heart , and Joe 's own life was surely a joyless thing . But he would have wanted us to laugh ; he was always indignant when people failed to see how funny his books were . He seems to have whined a good deal to his friends , but in his writings he bears up with a sort of jaunty , battered stoicism . Perhaps his epitaph should be taken from that other raddled bohemian , Mehitabel the cat : toujours gai.   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
