txt Q  --  I purChased a new Subaru sedan in February , 1980 . To date , the car has 40,000 miles on it . It is now back at the dealer having a faulty brake system replaced for the fourth time , and I will not pay the $270 charge . The dealer representative , , Tom Fennell , has refused to admit to the problem and pay the $270 , It seems that every 10,000 mites the brake pads wear down . I reluctantly paid for the first replacement of pads . The Subaru dealer paid for the second and third replacement of brake pads , admitting then that there was a problem that other Subarns were having as well . After the third replacement , I was assured that the problem was remedied and the brakes would last 40,000 miles . But 10,000 miles later , the familiar scraping noises began again , indicating the pads were worn down .

" Friction wearing items are not covered under warranty , " Fennell , service manager for . Subaru Mid-America Inc. , said .

Four months after the accident a representative called to ask for some information regarding the accident : I thought that was strange because they had a tape of my tetOniony . I heard nothing until January of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from him when the ease was settled . Would you please Investigate ? Reader , Wheeling A ? " The accident , " T. D. Whetsell , a Liberty Mutual spokesman , said " where our insured struck the pedestrian , resulted in a bodily injury payment in the amount of $12,500 .
