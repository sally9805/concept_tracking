It wasn ' t long ago that trend-spotters were predicting an era of enlightened films in which women ' s roles would increasingly reflect the image of the New Woman . With the exception of a couple of Jane Fonda films , plus Sally Field in " Norma Rae " and Jill Clayburgh in " An Unmarried Woman , " that trend hasn ' t produced much of interest . In the majority of the films released here since the first of the year , women are still being used as they were in the bad old , preraised consciousness days - as plucky sidekicks to men of unusual power ( " Superman II , " " Raiders of the Lost Ark " ) , as potential victims of mad killers ( " The Fan , " " Happy Birthday to Me " ) or as decorative objects in outright horror films ( Betsy Palmer ' s decapitated head , which is seen briefly in " Friday the 13th , Part Two " ) . // It may not be a coincidence that the best performances by women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere from two to six years old and , for one reason or another , have remained unreleased until now. // These would include Miss Jackson ' s bracing , profoundly moving portrayal of the late Stevie Smith , the English poet , in " Stevie , " as well as the performances of Amanda Plummer and Diane Lane in " Cattle Annie and Little Britches , " which was made in 1979 , and the performance of Sandrine Battistella in Jean-Luc Godard ' s " Numero Deux , " made in 1975 . It ' s possibly pushing things to call Miss Battistella ' s appearance in " Numero Deux " a performance . More important is the way Mr. Godard uses and considers her , but the movie , which is in repertory at the Carnegie Hall Cinema , qualifies as one of the few seriously probing works about women to be seen this year. // Another such film , also far off the beaten track , is Victor Nunez ' s screen version of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings ' s " Gal Young Un . " This features a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Jan Egleson , an independent filmmaker in Boston , also provides a good woman ' s role in his " The Dark at the End of the Street " for young Laura Harrington . Thus the best of the current movies about women either are the work of independent filmmakers or represent the work of an earlier , more optimistic time , sometimes both . Could it be that the major producers really don ' t think of women as serious people or , worse , as box office ? // That question may not be entirely fair - producers do not sit down together and agree to turn out a load of movies on any particular subject or theme . Yet the evidence is on the screen : women characters in today ' s movies are as lightweight as they ' ve always been , though some of the performances have been extremely good. // Definitely not to be included in this category is Liv Ullmann ' s performance in the Anthony Harvey-Frederic Raphael " Richard ' s Things , " about a woman who thought her marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatal heart attack , that he ' s been carrying on with a much younger woman . What does she do ? She falls immediately into an affair of her own , though this affair is far different from any that Bette Davis might have suffered through in some old Warner Bros. chestnut , which " Richard ' s Things " might otherwise remind you of. // Miss Ullmann ' s affair is with her late husband ' s mistress , the conceit of Mr. Raphael ' s screenplay being that these two women are brought together in a love-hate relationship that somehow keeps the dead man ' s memory alive . " Richard ' s Things " has less to do with life or literature than with a gimmick . Lois Gould and Otto Preminger handled the same basic situation far more wittily in the scathing " Such Good Friends , " based on Miss Gould ' s novel. // Has Miss Ullmann ever given a decent performance in a film not directed by Ingmar Bergman ? If so , I haven ' t seen it . In " Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those dreadfully self-conscious , Great Lady performances in which the star has all sorts of numbing opportunities to look brave , noble , bereaved , angry , confused and , frequently , to drive an automobile. // I only mention the last because , for some reason , whenever Miss Ullman is photographed driving a car , she rocks rhythmically from side to side like a metronome , as if trying to mime the motion of a car that ' s supposed to be on the road but is actually up on blocks inside a studio , or maybe to indicate that the spring has sprung in the driver ' s seat. // Something is wrong when you notice details of this sort , but then Mr. Raphael ' s screenplay is full of the kind high-faluting talk that only gets talked in bad movies : " You make me feel alive , " and " I ' m not sure if you ' re being kind or very cruel , " and ( my favorite line , spoken by the mistress to the widow shortly before they fall into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Weaver gives a most appealing performance in the Peter Yates-Steve Tesich " Eyewitness , " but it ' s understandably limited by the nature of the film , which is a suspense-comedy . Limited in similar ways by the films that contain them are the performances of Sally Field in Martin Ritt ' s " Back Roads , " Lauren Bacall in " The Fan " ( you may never again see a film that , as you watch it , you so desperately wish were about something other than the plot it has ) , and Carol Burnett in Alan Alda ' s " The Four Seasons. " // Susan Sarandon is splendid in Louis Malle ' s " Atlantic City , " but that film is Burt Lancaster ' s . Though one can enjoy and admire the performances of Simone Signoret and Delphine Seyrig in Moshe Mizrahi ' s " I Sent a Letter to My Love , " the performances are so bound up with that of Jean Rochefort , and the movie so dependent on a not very credible gimmick , that one can not easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very deep level. // A good case can be made on behalf of Catherine Deneuve in Francois Truffaut ' s " The Last Metro , " but there is a regal tone to the performance that somehow softens it . The character ' s unflappable nobility recalls a kind of earlier , popular fiction more fully than it does experience gained from life . On the other hand , " The Last Metro " is about a time in history ( the Nazi occupation of Paris ) when heroism and unflappable nobility were possibilities. // There are no such reservations about Miss Jackson ' s performance in " Stevie , " which Hugh Whitemore adapted from his London stage play that starred Miss Jackson , and which has been directed by Robert Enders who , most of the time , resists the temptation to " open up " the stage piece . When the writing and the performances are as fine as they are in " Stevie , " there ' s no reason to open it up by cutting away from what was the play ' s single set , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Palmers Green , outside London , shared by Stevie and her aunt ( Mona Washbourne ) . // Much in the way that Stevie Smith , who died in 1971 at the age of 69 , explored , in her poetry , the origins of the universe and her relation to it without ever venturing very far from home , Miss Jackson ' s Stevie brings to life a remarkable range of fears , furies , loves , obsessions , doubts and occasional triumphs without leaving that living room . She sometimes talks directly to the camera as if it were a co-conspirator , and sometimes to the other citizens of the world , who , in " Stevie , " are three - her aunt , her one-time suitor named Freddy ( Alec McCowen ) , and a character identified only as The Man ( Trevor Howard ) , who acts as a narrator and , at one point , steps in as one of the many friends Stevie collected late in life. // It ' s possible to fault " Stevie " as a thinly disguised theatrical piece , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one watches Miss Jackson and listens to what ' s being said . All movies need not be billion-dollar comic strips . There must be room for this kind of physically closed-in but expansive drama in which the exploration of a single character is its own kind of odyssey , an interior adventure. // " Stevie " makes use of a lot of Stevie Smith ' s funny , biting , seldom soothing verse , though the verse is always connected to the matters at hand and never slipped in as self-conscious recitation . It gives us the grand dimensions of the character Miss Jackson is playing , allowing us to share her panics and peeves , her sudden bursts of self-awareness , and to see the world through her most particular vision . There ' s no need to cut away from Palmers Green to Buckingham Palace , where Stevie goes to receive an honor from the Queen , when Stevie herself recalls the occasion so vividly and hilariously without budging from that living room. // " Stevie " permits Miss Jackson to exercise her singular comic and dramatic gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do since " Sunday , Bloody Sunday . " This is a riveting performance . Coming in a film season in which one of the funniest woman ' s performances is being given by a female impersonator ( Divine in John Waters ' s " Polyester " ) , " Stevie " is a life-raft for sanity , as well as a demonstration of what a great actress can do when the material matches her talent. b //
