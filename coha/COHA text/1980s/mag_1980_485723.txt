I would put D.O.E . ' s nuclear-waste tanks holding high-level waste from military activities under N.R.C. regulatory control . I really do n't see the national security problem . N.R.C. talked about it for a year with D.O.E. , and I never heard anything specific beyond that this may be the camel 's nose in the tent . ? Nuclear Regulatory Commissioner Victor Gilinsky , before a committee of Congress , September 1979 For the past thirty-five years , the Atomic Energy Commission and now the Department of Energy have been manufacturing plutonium for nuclear weapons . As a result of these operations , the Federal Government has generated about as much nuclear waste as private industry . To those in the D.O.E . who manufacture it , plutonium is a prized commodity , with extraordinary ideological significance . The production of weapons plutonium is managed by a zealous and secretive bureaucracy that regards itself as carrying out a sacred national mission . This bureaucracy and its powerful allies in the Congressional Armed Services Committees are now fighting to prevent the enormous waste burden they have created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation that would open up the D.O.E . ' s deteriorated waste-storage facilities to oversight by an outside agency , the Nuclear Regulatory Commission . Waste operations in private industry are licensed and regulated by the N.R.C. But D.O.E . waste facilities are unlicensed , and the depart ( Continued on Page 704 ) ? Hazardous Waste ( Continued From Front Cover ) ment determines its own health and safety criteria without any oversight from the N.R.C. or the public . Above all , the absence of N.R.C. licensing has prevented the public from becoming aware of Federal nuclear wastes . A bill ( S. 2980 ) that would modestly expand the N.R.C. 's authority over Government- wastes has been introduced in the Senate by Senator Gary Hart , but the legislation is meeting opposition from the Energy Department and the House and Senate Armed Services Committees . They claim N.R.C. regulation would jeopardize national security . However , the bill 's sponsors in the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation believe S. 2980 is vital for public safety . " I have this terrible nagging hunch , " said subcommittee member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national security we may find some very questionable practices with regard to disposal of Federal wastes . " The problem of nuclear waste is highly controversial in the United States , and the public holds the commercial nuclear industry responSible for it . The poisonous substance plutonium is also controversial , and three years ago President Jimmy Carter announced with much fanfare that the United States had " abandoned " plutonium technologies . In , reality , the Federal Government is equally responsible , along with industry , for generating nuclear waste , and has certainly not abandoned plutonium technologies . This difference between reality and public perception has created a very dangerous situation in which decisions within the Department of Energy on the disposal of Federal wastes are strongly influenced by a desire to avoid publicity and proceed unhindered with the production of plutonium . Federal high-level ( HL ) waste disposal has been deferred for thirty-five years . , Current funding needs for waste storage are quite low , but final HL waste disposal will cost many billions of dollars . The steep rise in expenditures that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criticism of the D.O.E : ' s ( now expanding ) plutonium-production operations , which are the source of Federal nuclear wastes . For the D.O.E . to proceed with waste disposal is therefore to jeopardize its own plutonium-production program , a fact that tends to neutralize incentives in the D.O.E . to solve the Federal wastes problem . Few countervailing forces exist within this closed system . N.R.C. regulation would force an upgrading of the D.O.E . ' s waste operations and could catalyze a much-needed public debate on Federal wastes and plutonium production . But that will require public pressure , because there is no one in the Government willing or powerful enough to impose N.R.C. regulation on the D.O.E . waste system . In all categories of nuclear waste  --  low level , TRU* ( plutonium-bearing ) , and high level  --  the quantities of Federal wastes either exceed or equal what has been generated by private industry . The D.O.E . maintains fifteen lowlevel/TRU disposal sites across the country , and has accumulated seventy-five million gallons of HL waste in storage tanks in South Carolina and Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curies of radioactivity in long-lived fission products ( strontium and cesium ) alone . If plutonium production had ceased in 1980 , this amount would drop , by 100 million curies in ten years due to radioactive decay . Instead , in September , President Carter ordered substantial production increases , which will add new wastes to the D.O.E . ' s HL storage tanks . The D.O.E . ' s HL waste tanks have deteriorated far below N.R.C. safety standards . " I 'll tell you flatly right now , those tanks are unlicensable , " then-chairman of the N.R.C. Joseph Hendrie told Senator Hart 's subcommittee last winter . He was referring to tanks at the Hanford Reservation in Washington State , where two-thirds of the Government 's HL waste inventory is stored . Hendrie does n't want to get involved , but if Congress makes the N.R.C. responsible for the Hanford wastes , " we will try to shut down that whole operation , " Hendrie said in hearings on S. 2980 . Hendrie 's threat is to be taken lightly , because the Hanford waste storage system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons of HL waste are stored at Hanford in 149 holding tanks , some of which were built in the 1940s and as many as fifty-eight of which are leaking . The Hanford wastes are probably the largest collection of hazardous materials on earth , the result of the reprocessing of more than 100,000 tons of irradiated fuel at the site during more than three decades of plutonium production . According to the D.O.E. , the cost for permanent disposal of the Hanford wastes may run as high as $30 billion . The D.O.E . ' s other major production site is the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina . Some twenty-four million gallons of HL waste are now stored in Savannah River tanks , with disposal costs estimated as high as $10 billion . That brings the disposal bill up to $40 billion for existing high-level wastes alone , not including future wastes and not including TRU , and low-level disposal . A concerned public made aware of this information through N.R.C. licensing proceedings might well ask if it is advisable to continue plutonium production in the United States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the camel 's nose in the tent . " The D.O.E . and the Atomic Energy Conimission have produced enough plutonium for the 30,000 nuclear warheads now deployed by the United States , and for stockpiling . One expert estimates that the Government has manufactured fifty tons of the substance , and still it continues to produce it , even though Duane Sewell , Assistant Secretary for Defense Programs with the D.O.E. , told the Senate Appropriations Committee in March of 1979 : " There is currently a sufficient inventory of recycled nuclear material available from weapons being retired each year to supply our projected demand for new weapons we plan to produce . " Testimony before the House and Senate Armed Services Committees within the past two years , revealed a sharp difference of opinion between the committees ' leadership and the D.O.E . The Energy Department believes that current plutonium-production levels are adequate , while the Armed Services Committees want production increased . The Senate Committee chairman , Henry Jackson , sought alternative views to those presented by the D.O.E. , and before long he began to refer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council allegedly describing a " serious shortage " of weapons plutonium . The committees then demanded that the President authorize increased plutonium-production levels , which Carter did shortly before the election . In the meantime , the Energy Department wants to build a new production reactor , at a cost of $3 billion , so it can continue to manufacture plutonium for the rest of the century . Staff members on the Senate Subcommittee on Nuclear Regulation said one of the roots of S. 2980 was the testimony of Steven ? Stalos , a Hanford tank-farm manager who resigned in 1978 in protest of waste-management practices at the Reservation . Stalos 's primary charges , which led to ' an investigation by the Department of Energy , were that monitoring for waste-tank leaks was being reduced and that the D.O.E . failed to classify apparently leaking tanks as such . The D.O.E . investigation and a March 1980 report to the Assistant Secretary for Environment yielded the infor matiOn that in addition to the twenty tanks announced to be leaking as of 1975 , another thirty-eight tanks are probably leaking HL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' s statistical analyses confidently predict a steady number of new tank leaks in the future . The hazard of leaks is reduced by the fact that the water table at Hanford lies far below the surface ( 150 to 300 feet down ) . In addition , a program to solidify waste in the Hanford tanks has been underway since 1970 . Some fifteen million gallons of liquid currently remain . However , when the first leak occurred in 1958 , the entire Hanford HL waste inventory was liquid , and the Reservation faced a catastrophe . As Department of Energy studies establish , the bottoms will eventually fall out of all 149 Hanford tanks . If this had occurred while the wastes were still liquid and mobile , fifty million gallons of HL waste would have " escaped engineered control . " There would have been no way to stop the wastes from draining down to the water table , and from there to the Columbia River , on which Hanford is located . The Reservation would have become an uncontrollable source of discharging radioactivity , permanently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuclear operations were exempted from the commission 's licensing procedures . The only exception is that any site for the final disposal of HL waste must be licensed by the N.R.C .. Such sites are now referred to as National Geologic Repositories ; none have been established yet , but under current plans National Repositories will be the final resting place for both commercial spent fuel and Department of Energy HL wastes . The 1974 law therefore created for the first time a facility containing nuclear-weapons waste that will come under the health and safety regulation of an independent outside agency . The law passed because the political influence of the A.E.C. industry and its defenders in the Congressional Joint Committee on Atomic Energy was at a low ebb were 1974 ? both the A.E.C. and the Joint Committee were dissolved that year for conflict of interest and promotional activity . Now , however , the A.E.C. 's plutonium operation is settled in the D.O.E. , and the A.E.C. 's Joint Committee supporters , such as Senator Henry Jackson and Representative Melvin Price , have regrouped in the House and Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal nuclear wastes , as well as plutonium production , and Jackson and Price are determined to hold the line against any further regulatory encroachments on the weapons facilities , such as Senator Hart 's bill , S. 2980 . T ndeed , Senator Jackson 's current objective is to circumvent entirely the 1974 law and establish an unlicensed National Repository exclusively for the disposal of the D.O.E . ' s high-level and TRU wastes at the proposed WIPP ( Waste Isolation Pilot Plant ) repository in New Mexico . Over the objections of the Carter Administration , the Armed Services Committees have won Congressional approval for legislation authorizing funds for WIPP and prohibiting N.R.C. licensing of the facility on the basis of a loophole in the 1974 law . In a message to Congress last February , Carter said he opposes the establishment of any unlicensed National Repository . However , under the Carter policy , most of the D.O.E . ' s waste operations would still remain outside N.R.C. jurisdiction . The Administration 's policy was based on the recommendations of the Interagency Review Group ( I.R.G. ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was concluded last year . The review group took up the question of expanding N.R.C. regulation to include currently exempt categories of D.O.E . wastes , as did a separate study ( known as NUREG-0527 ) , conducted by the - N.R.C. itself at the direction of the Hart subcommittee . The only important licensing extension the two studies recommended was the licensing of final disposal of TRU wastes . In 1978 , all five N.R.C. commissioners had recommended to the Hart subcommittee that the commission license the D.O.E . ' s high-level waste-storage tanks , but after completing NUREG-0527 , three commissioners changed their minds . The Hanford tanks are , as chairman Hendrie said in dismay , " a quarter of a century old . " The N.R.C. , apparently , wants to regulate only new facilities where standards and criteria are clear-cut . Commissioners Gilinsky and Peter Bradford , however , dissented from their three colleagues and recommended that the N.R.C. should license the Energy Department 's present high-level waste-storage tanks . S. 2980 emerges from these deliberations . The objectives of the licensing provisions of the bill are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N.R.C. ; to close the loophole in the 1974 law that would enable Senator Jackson to establish an unlicensed National Repository , and to create the possibility of N.R.C. oversight of the high-level waste tanks . The key provision of the bill calls for a five-year pilot program under which the commission would regulate five to ten Department of Energy waste sites , including " at least one HL waste tank . " The bill also gives the President authority to suspend the pilot program at any time he finds it a threat to national security . The Hart subcommittee was not impressed by the D.O.E . ' s arguments against Nuclear Regulatory Commission oversight of the HL tanks . The department took the position that " no benefit to the public health and safety " would result from such oversight of Federal wastes and declared that " N.R.C. should have no right to interfere or involve itself in any of D.O.E . ' s high priority , indispensable national programs . " Among the intolerable features of N.R.C. regulation , the D.O.E . cited " visits to facilities and requests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial determinations , possible judicial involvement " and " the need to comply with regulatory edicts . " N.R.C. regulation might delay the production of nuclear bombs , the D.O.E . contended . The department rejected Senator Hart 's idea of a " buffer " of temporary waste holding points exempt from N.R.C. jurisdiction . Actually , the Hanford tanks , as N.R.C. commissioner Gilinsky pointed out , " are full , and they really have nothing to do with the production chain any longer . " There is no nuclear-weapons fabrication taking place at Hanford , and the single plutonium-production reactor now operating at the site is producing fuel-grade , rather than weapons-grade , plutonium . At the point when the D.O.E . admitted in hearings that atomic secrets would not be revealed by publishing waste data on the Hanford tanks , Senator Hart exclaimed in exasperation , " Is n't the D.O.E . ' s real concern , which they failed to state this morning , that is , the public access , hearings , intervention and all the rest of it , is n't that what really concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . official replied , " a line drawing problem . A line may look fine when you draw it , " he continued , " but it may not stay there . If you draw a line somewhere , it could be moved somewhere else , " and then " precedence would be set . " There are two main options for final disposal of the Hanford HL tank wastes : leave the wastes in the tanks permanently , or empty the tanks and move the wastes to a National Repository . Both options are unsatisfactory . HL wastes in the Hanford tanks contain 110 million curies of radioactivity ( and 390 kilograms of plutonium ) . The ground-disposed low-level/TRU wastes contain at least three million curies ( plus 633 kilOgrams of plutonium ) . Large portions of these wastes are long-lived fission products , which remain hazardous for 700 years , and the plutonium remains hazardous for thousands of years . Another 165 million curies in capsules of long-lived fission products ( strontium 90 and cesium 137 ) , which were stripped out of HL wastes to prevent boiling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low-level/TRU wastes , and the HL tank wastes ( capsules excluded ) , lie very close to the land surface of the Reservation . The low-level/TRU wastes were grounddisposed over an area of 700 acres , and most of the long-lived radioactivity and plutonium in this material has penetrated no deeper than fifteen feet in soil . The bottoms of the HL waste tanks lie at a depth of fifty feet . The contaminated region is therefore a shallow layer of the surface of the Reservation . If the wastes are left in place , this surface will have to be stabilized and kept under observation for 700 years . The D.O.E . says the main problem they see with the stability of the surface is that a glacier could form on the site millenniums hence ; however , a few years ago rodents burrowed into waste deposits at Hanford and spread radioactivity over four square miles . The American public is under the impression that concentrated , long-lived nuclear wastes , such as HI , wastes and spent commercial fuel , will be buried in National Geologic Repositories engineered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who are actually working on the Hanford wastes regard moving the tank wastes to a National Repository as a practical impossibility because the costs and the health hazards would be so immense . The Hanford tanks were designed for fifty-year storage of liquid wastes . Solids , however , soon precipitated out of the liquid in the form of a sludge , which covers the bottom of every tank to depths of sixteen feet . When more tanks began leaking in the 1960s , the liquid above the sludge was pumped out , evaporated to a loose solid and returned to the tanks . Some fifteen million gallons of irreducible liquids still mixed with the solids will be the source of future leaks at Hanford  --  leaks which the D.O.E . is convinced will not reach the water table in significant quantities . Otherwise , the tanks contain solids which are extremely difficult to remove ; the sludge in most Hanford tanks has never been moved since it was first deposited decades ago . The domes of the Hanford tanks are buried under seven feet of earth . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) conduits and instrument openings , and the tank interiors are obstructed by girders and cooling coils . All interior engineering must be done by remote control and requires elaborate equipment to mine the tanks and shield workers from radioactivity . The Hanford tanks can be emptied , but only , as one D.O.E . official put it , " at enormous cost . " For practical purposes , in other words , the Hanford tank wastes are irretrievable . If the wastes are moved , emptying the tanks would be only the first step of a vast engineering project . Laboriously , tediously , over years , the millions of gallons of contents must be converted to a durable , water-resistant solid . Millions of canisters must then be produced , and if a National Repository is not built in Hanford bedrock , the canisters must be shipped over the nation 's highways to an off-site repository . The D.O.E . estimates that this entire ' operation would cost $30 billion , and many in the department would rather not undertake it . " You can do anything with technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but , considering the workers ' exposure and the money involved , is it worthwhile to move the Hanford wastes ? " Instead , say many D.O.E . officials enthusiastically , why not4just leave the wastes where they are ? It would be about $25 billion cheaper to leave the 110 million curies buried under seven feet of earth in 149 rickety storage tanks . The department envisions filling the tanks with sand to catch the domes when they collapse , building up the earth cover and , paving the entire surface , including the low-level/TRU burial grounds . This is " tank isolation , " the leading option inside the D.O.E . for ultimate disposal of the Hanford HL wastes , and it is a far cry from the criteria which have been set for National Geologic Repositories : burial deep underground in bedrock in an insoluble , durable waste form ; unrestricted access to the land surface , and termination of surveillance after a few decades . Half the Hanford tank contents are a loosely consolidated salt , which readily dissolves . The land surface is radioactive now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paved surface . The burial is shallow  --  in soil , not rock  --  and the surveillance requirements if the wastes are left in place are unending . The D.O.E . is aware that " tank isolation " does not fit the criteria for National Repositories  --  criteria now being specified in detail by the N.R.C. Therefore , it is necessary to keep the N.R.C .. out of Hanford . If the N.R.C. disapproved " tank isolation , " then the D.O.E . would have to go to Congress for the necessary $20 billion or $30 billion to do a proper waste-disposal job at Hanford , plus the additional $10 billion which will be needed to dispose of the Government 's other gargantuan HL waste collection  --  the contents of thirty-seven tanks at the Savannah River Plant in South Carolina . , There are two main differences between HL waste storage at Savannah River and Hanford : at Savannah River the leaking tanks have a " saucer " from which liquids can be pumped , and the tanks are at the water table . Savannah River receives seventy inches of . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and it is situated above a major aquifer . The D.O.E . is not considering final HL waste disposal on-site at Savannah River . Instead , the options that are too costly and too risky to be undertaken at Hanford must be carried out at Savannah River . There , HL wastes must be retrieved from the tanks , must be immobilized and must be shipped to an off-site repository . Most of the new wastes from the increased production levels authorized by President Carter will be generated at Savannah River . Yet the question of nuclear wastes was apparently not even considered when the decision to increase production was made . Six weeks after the decision , the people in the D.O.E . ' s Office of Waste Operations in Washington , D.C. , said that the department " does n't know " how much waste will result from the new production . The D.O.E . would not mind spending $40 billion for waste disposal . The problem for the department is that asking Congress for sums of this size might trigger scrutiny of D.O.E . operations by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , it is in the D.O.E . ' s interest to keep a low profile on its waste operations , defer final decisions on HL waste disposal for as long as possible and delay tabulating the total bill . If there are any inquiries , the D.O.E . can " throw out the words ' national security ' and have everybody go into paralysis , " as Commissioner Gilinsky put it . Plutonium production can be maintained , and the disposal bill for current and future wastes can be presented years from now . Congress will then be forced to pay the bill , just as it will be forced to pay for disposal of Government wastes created so far . 1 T he problem for the American people is that responsibility for waste management is in the hands of decision makers in the Department of Energy and the Armed Services Committees whose chief interest is in plutonium production . Local Federal waste managers have had trouble getting access to these decision makers . According to one D.O.E . official , the reason Hanford managers began talking publicly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the attention of a relatively oblivious Joint Committee on AtomiC Energy the seriousness of the waste situation at the facility . Today , Hanford 's managers are worried about the under-funding of waste operations , but the leadership of the Armed Services Committees is worried about the " under-funding " of plutonium production . And in the name of their sacred priority , the Armed Services Committees give every indication of having coerced an unwilling President Carter to authorize higher plutonium-production levels during the tense weeks prior to the November election . No Government figures have been published to back up the committees ' assertions of a sudden , unexpected " shortfall " in the plutonium supply . Defense Department and National Security Council reports allegedly show these shortfalls , but since the studies are classified , the assumptions on which they are based can not be evaluated . These assumptions are critical to defining a " shortage . " For example , how large are the Government 's stockpiles ? Have all the weapons constituting the alleged demand been authorized for deployment , or are some only on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of Carter's- September decision to increase production , the firm position of the D.O.E . and the Administration was that existing production levels are adequate to meet weapons needs . The decision to increase production is of great importance , and it can not stand in the face of so much public disagreement among government officials . The most dangerous result , however , of D.O.E . ' s need to if ' conceal the HL waste problem and fend off questions about plutonium production is that this creates pressures within the department to choose cheap , possibly inadequate , disposal plans like " tank isolation " at Hanford . N.R.C. oversight of HL waste operations , like that outlined in S. 2980 , would open up Federal waste planning to scrutiny by the public and nongovernment scientists . Without N.R.C. oversight , however , D.O.E . may be able to implement plans like tank isolation , and to do so in a manner quite beyond public control . . ?                    @
