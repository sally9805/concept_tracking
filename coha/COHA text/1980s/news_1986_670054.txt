BIRMINGHAM , Ala.  --  I sat with Girl Scout Troop No. 68 from Marion County at the state capitol last week in Montgomery , where hundreds of us gathered to watch George Corley Wallace bid a public adieu to Alabama . The scouts were around the age I was 23 years ago when the governor declared " Segregation forever ! " at his first inauguration , in this same building , and they were too young to know how to interpret the loud sobs that answered Mr. Wallace ' s own choking voice , as I had had little understanding of the cheers that greeted the 1963 address . Having eventually figured out what the cheers were about , I was not expecting to sympathize with the sobs . But to my surprise , George Wallace ' s announcement that he would not seek a fifth term as my governor shook me up . " Did you cry ? " scoffed an Alabama compatriot , John A. Yung IV , who as an assistant state attorney general prosecuted two avid constituents of Mr. Wallace ' s former politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black churches . I remained seated during the standing ovation , yet peering down at Mr. Wallace through the balcony balustrade , I felt the teary sensation , transcending simple sadness , of a phenomenon I was studying in high-school English toward the end of Mr. Wallace ' s first term : the epiphany of the gentleman-journalist narrator of " All the King ' s Men " as he passes " out of history into history and the awful responsibility of Time . " For me , the epic moment was conveyed not by a speech writer ' s statesmanly rhetoric , but in the beautiful economy of Mr. Wallace ' s farewell salutes-cum-blown kisses and the plain words of the aide who wheeled him away at the end of the news conference : " Please let the governor exit . I think it will be in everybody ' s best interest . " The governor did not serve the best interests of the electorate he held in his sway for 23 years , over an unprecedented four terms , and only upon his exit did I allow myself the thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perverse compulsion to keep this emblem of our shame around , like an unofficial state seal . The strange career of George Wallace , from segregationist to integrationist , finally turned the burden of Southern history into something more vital than a literary cliche , something that weighed on the consciousness of everyday people and not merely the imaginations of our tormented writer-geniuses . The South ' s vaunted sense of history has often proved more frivolously genealogical than epochal , and there is a regional tendency to deny or reinvent history rather than come to terms with it . But the present tense of Mr. Wallace made myth-making impossible . The reprises of such a " Grand Guignol " civil-rights villain  --  ultimately , in his 1982 reelection , by a biracial consensus unique even by Southern standards of irony  --  gave literal meaning to Wallace Stevens ' s observation " All history is modern history . " It would have been truer to form if we had swept the Wallace " Stand in the Schoolhouse Door " era under the rug and elected a morally unencumbered figurehead  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our infamy every time the newspapers wrote up a civil-rights anniversary . But even as we blamed the press for our bad " image , " Alabama was an unsung vanguard of genuine regional change . George Wallace may have done it for political self-preservation , but he said the three words probably never before uttered consecutively in the Old Confederacy : " I was wrong . " Perhaps his refusal to rationalize the past will spare the Girl Scouts sitting with me in the capitol last week from repeating the shameful history of their grandparents , of Mr. Wallace ' s generation . In that respect they may have an edge on the children of our sister states , whose sleek , technocratic governors have been far more successful than ours has at cultivating the latest myth of the South , the Sun Belt . But if Alabama has remained a rough and rusty stud on that glittering belt , maybe our resulting economic backwardness will be offset by spiritual gains . Had George Wallace not stayed on the scene to taunt me , I doubt I would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so remote South of segregation  --  let alone retrieved it and tried to resolve it . After I wrote some peevish articles about his final comeback four years ago , he telephoned my uncle , a Republican lawyer in Birmingham , and huffed , " Hobart ! Are you any kin to that Diane McWhorter ? " That George Wallace knew who I was filled me with the elation of having paid some historical rent and thereby earned a legitimate lease on my region ' s future . The 10-year-old Camp Fire Girl who saw her governor throw down the racial gauntlet in 1963 had grown up to take her place beside the federal judges , National News Media-ites and assorted other " sissy-britches " on the Wallace hit list . Now I knew what the narrator of " All the King ' s Men " meant when he said , " This has been the story of Willie Stark , but it is my story , too . " Last week , encountering George Wallace in person for the first time in my life , I acknowledged the salute of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - Ms. McWhorter , a contributor to several national publications , is working on a book about Birmingham in 1963 , to be published by Summit Books.
