@#  | The Kamikaze Club is mobbed . And the music ? " Shout " by Tears for Fears ? is n't just loud . It 's deafening . But only a third of the 600 or so young trendies here in the upwardly mobile Chelsea area of Manhattan are dancing to what the deejay is playing . The rest are transfixed by what 's happening on the Kamikaze Club stage ? 17 haircutters clipping , trimming , curling and razoring their way through an awesome variety of styles . On the right Elizabeth Rosado , 17 , of Brooklyn , is getting a halfMohawk . Much of Elizabeth 's black , curly hair is down to a closely cropped four inches and tumbling fast . Her stylist , Oscar , is using an electric razor to shave lines through the stubble on her right temple to form a peace symbol surrounded by a series of concentric arcs . " I was going to get a bat with a cross in the middle , " she explains , " but I forgot the picture . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I love it . It 's so bizarre , " he shouts . All in a night 's work for the stylists from Astor Place Hair Designers , 2 Astor Place , on the edge of New York 's Greenwich Village . Other haircutters might tremble at the thought of an audience , but not these folks who have elevated barbering to the level of a performing art ? so much so that the " designers " were booked for a night into the Kamikaze . In a time when there is a mania among the young for hip hairdos and in a place ? New York ? where more is more , the Astor has become a mecca . Tourists flock to the shop and spectators throng the sidewalk in front , gazing and gaping through the picture window at the show inside . The curious wander through the shop 's three levels , mingling with the stylists and watching , often in wonderment , as the designs take shape . At center stage in this swirling scene is the Astor 's manager , Pasquale Gallo . Pasquale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by sweeping out his uncle 's place in Naples . He came to the United States two years ago and joined the then small staff at Astor Place . On his third day he moved up to the first chair , which sits squarely in the front window , and with his gold chains , designer sportswear and neck scarf he makes a rakish lead barber . When Pasquale came to Astor Place , it was a traditional men 's barbershop with five barbers . He , along with Enrico and Frank Vezza , the brothers who own the shop , began to attract a younger clientele by introducing some shorter , zippier styles , like the spina depesce ( spine of the fish ) , which leaves the hair at the midline slightly longer and feathery . At the same time , punky types from the surrounding East Village began to ask the technically superb barbers to do other strange and wonderful things . " We put together the old school with the new style , " says Pasquale . A year ago the shop added a mezzanine level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are 52 cutters and 50 chairs . Genuine Bargain : Standing on the basement stairs , Paul Vezza , Enrico 's son , directs traffic , matching an available stylist with the next customer as music blares in the background . " We 're successful , " explains Paul over the music , " because whatever style you want , we can do well , and that , along with the price , made things blossom for us . " A basic cut for men is $7 ; for women , $9 . A wash is $2 more ; blow drying costs an @# additional $1 . Pasquale gets $3 extra . Compared with the rest of the city , where a run-of-themill unisex shop charges at least $12.50 for a men 's cut and a woman can easily pay $35 for a shampoo and cut , Astor Place is one of the few genuine bargains in New York . But there is one more critical factor that explains why this shop creates such rabid loyalty . Enthusiasts believe the Astor barbers , unlike others , will do precisely what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a 22-year-old construction worker , all the way down from the Bronx to get her Mohawk , which she likes long in back . " Other places , they cut a piece of my long hair , " she complains . " I get upset when they do that . " Even though the truly bizarre cuts make up only about have earned Astor Place its reputation . When the shop won an award in January from the Council of Fashion Designers of America ? the first time the fashion industry equivalent of an Oscar had gone to a hairstyling salon ? it was " because of the punk hairdos , " says Robert Raymond of the CFDA . And a new book on Astor Place , called " New American Haircuts , " emphasizes more daring looks . Kicky Cuts : Still , most people come to get fairly normal , if somewhat kicky , cuts .

It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking like 80 other women . " After viewing her new do ? short on the sides , somewhat longer and almost spiky on top , with a wisp of a bang ? she exclaims , " This is great ! " and kisses Pasquale . And so they come ? in search of the normal and abnormal , the traditional or something a bit nontraditional ? by the hundreds each day for a good haircut at a good price and a barber who understands . Dennis Bode , an importer from Jersey City , gets a " short little tony " ? almost a poodle cut but a little sleeker on the sides . Gene Matarese , a packaging representative , looks like a preppy dreamboat after his trim . Doris Steward , an engineerturned-singer , gets a wine red cellophaning , which gives a burgundy sheen to her jet-black mane . John Bleh , 16 , of Teaneck , gets a crewcut , modified by the four-inch bleached mane that hangs from his forehead and a patch in back that has been shaved bare from the ears down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours a week .
