West Europe is disturbed by U.S. unpredictability <P> After Israel and the Arab states , no nations were more dismayed by the Administration 's mishandling of the U.N . vote than America 's West European allies . Reason : there had already been strains in the alliance over the issue of how to answer Moscow 's new threat in Central Asia . The Carter Administration feels that France in particular , and West Germany to a lesser degree , have been somewhat laggard in their response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . In addition , Washington is concerned about a proposed West European initiative in the Security Council that could lead to a resolution on Palestinian self-determination . Such a move , American policymakers fear , could upset the Egyptian-Israeli negotiations on autonomy for the West Bank and Gaza . <P> The West Europeans , for their part , have become increasingly unnerved by Carter 's unpredictable and seemingly capricious approach to foreign policy . Although fully briefed on the U.S. 's proposed response to the Soviet invasion , the West Germans were stung by the President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first told West German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt that a boycott was not being considered . Carter changed his mind , and Bonn was given only two hours ' notice before the boycott was announced . Said a West German diplomat of last week 's Security Council debacle : " The U.N . flip-flop is just one more piece of evidence to support Schmidt 's contention that West Europeans must look out for themselves , and protect themselves as much as possible against the effect of these Carter fiascoes . " <P> Schmidt and French President Valry Giscard d'Estaing share Washington 's view that the Soviets must withdraw their troops from Afghanistan . The two leaders also believe that Carter overreacted to the invasion , largely because of domestic political considerations . Bonn has tried to play down the transatlantic differences , stressing that they involve approach rather than objectives . Nonetheless , the result has been a closer relationship between Bonn and Paris , culminating in the Schmidt-Giscard summit in the French capital last month . As a Bonn official put it , both men " felt strongly that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French diplomat in West Germany : " The Soviets horribly miscalculated in Afghanistan . Carter reacted too rashly . Schmidt and Giscard are the fellows who are trying to keep a cool head . "
