It is not really what we had in mind . It is not the American house we dreamed of , not even the house we grew up in , the house we remember . Sometimes it stands a little too near the freeway , in a raw mat of sodded lawn-a poignant dry-green whiffle of grass with a single sapling in it that gives no more shade than a swizzle stick . The house has the frank , bleak starkness of the cut-rate . Its interiors are minimalist , and grimly candid about it . No woodwork , no extras , no little frills of gentility any more . No front hall . One bathroom , with the cheapest fixtures , no bathtub . <P> Closets as shallow as medicine chests . Walls like shirt cardboards , walls that will not hold the nail when we move in and try to hang the family pictures . <P> All of this-the economy model stripped down to an irreducible ascetic tackiness-can be ours for more dollars than our fathers used to earn , total , in ten or 15 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least the six-bedroom Lake Forest spread of a successful cardiologist . <P> Americans have always cherished an almost ideological longing for a house of their own . <P> Today , the sweet fantasy of the dream house , the little fortress of home , My Blue Heaven , has jolted up against hard economics . <P> The prices of land and money have climbed to sometimes inaccessible heights . Mortgage rates ( a record high of 18.6% lately ) make it more and more difficult to buy a house , or to sell one . <P> Americans can no longer afford to keep moving to fresh landscape farther and farther from the cities ; gasoline is too expensive . So the price of the limited desirable land available rides up on the cost push . In some places-parts of California , for example-the great speculative housing dementia has cooled down recently . But the damage has been done . <P> If inflation has not exactly devoured the dream , it has taken a painful bite out of it . Good , even splendid houses are still built ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoovervilles . But the number of Americans who can afford first-class housing is dwindling . The median price of a new home has gone from $20,000 in 1965 to $70,000 in 1981 . The traditional budget formula said that a family should spend no more than one-quarter of gross income on housing . If they obey that rule , less than 10% of Americans can afford a median-priced house . <P> Some older or more nimble Americans ( especially those lucky enough to have bought a house in , say , the Eisenhower or Johnson or Nixon years ) have done handsomely in the runaway housing bazaar . They went trading through the ' 70s market wearing that extortionate little smirk that oil sheiks display on the way out of OPEC meetings .
