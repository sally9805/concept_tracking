Voltaire : " Allow me very humbly to kiss your holy feet " <P> " Content the King in the matter of marriage , " the petition pleads , " in order to avoid the ills that may befall the church if his will is contested . " The petitioners were right . King Henry VIII of England had fallen in love with Anne Boleyn and wanted a son and heir by her . He was determined to put aside his wife , Catherine of Aragon . But when Catherine appealed to Pope Clement VII , the Pope ordered Henry to halt his annulment proceedings . Henry , as the 75 bishops and courtiers warned in their petition to Rome , would not allow his will to be contested . When the Pope refused , the King of England broke with Rome . <P> The Reformation that befell the English church is nearly half a millennium past by now . Henry and Catherine have long crumbled into dust . But the 2-ft. by 3-ft. parchment petition , headed Sanctissimo in Christo and bemedaled with ribbons and the 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it did on the day in 1530 when it arrived on Pope Clement 's desk . It was long filed away in the Vatican , but 100 years ago , the church opened its ancient archives to selected scholars . This year , to commemorate that date , the Vatican has put 236 of its choicest treasures on public display . Many of the documents are as notable for their exquisite calligraphy and design as for their historic significance . Until the end of the year , from 10 a.m. till noon , curious visitors can also see : <P> A letter written in 1246 by Genghis Khan 's grandson and heir , the Grand Khan Kuyuk , grandiosely inviting Pope Innocent IV and " the kings of the West " to a summit conference at Karakorum . <P> A letter of 1535 in which Pope Paul III hires " our beloved son , Michelangelo " as architect , sculptor and painter for the unfinished church of St. Peter 's . As part payment , the Pope grants the young painter all the tolls from a Po River ferry crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which the distinctly anticlerical skeptic Voltaire , praising a book written by Pope Benedict XIV , writes " allow me very humbly to kiss your holy feet and to ask with the deepest respect your benediction . " <P> A miscellany of letters from Napoleon , Copernicus , Erasmus , Rossini , Queen Christina of Sweden and Mary Queen of Scots . Not included is the legendary erotica collection widely rumored to be hidden somewhere in the Vatican Archives . <P> The oldest specimen in the current Vatican exhibit is a Liber Diurnus Romanorum Pontificum that dates from the late 8th century and establishes regulations , worthy of the Pentagon , for the preparation and maintenance of ecclesiastical documents . But the exact origin of the Vatican Archives is unknown . As early as 303 Emperor Diocletian decreed that everything accumulated until that time be destroyed . In 410 the Visigoths stormed Rome , and the city burned for three days . The Vandals sacked it in 455 , the Saracens in 846.                  @ @ @
