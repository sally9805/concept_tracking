In secret remarks to the Communist Party ' s Standing Committee , Mr. Deng indicated he will act as the ultimate decisionmaker until he is incapacitated by senility or Communist Party General Secretary Jiang Zemin is deemed to have enough authority to succeed him. // Deng is holding on to power as he tries to defend some of the accomplishments of his 65-year political career . Conservatives in the party are reversing market-oriented economic reforms that have buoyed China to prosperity since Deng initiated them a decade ago. // // Also , Deng ' s hard-line rivals have campaigned for a severing of contacts with democratic nations since approving the military crackdown on pro-democracy protests in June , Western and Asian diplomats say . Deng ended several years of destructive isolation for China in 1979. // Deng ' s remarks show that he believes Mr. Jiang now lacks the power to be China ' s top authority . A summary of his address was given to the Monitor by a source in the party. // The remarks also contradict official assertions that Jiang became the chief leader when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day , Deng turned over the chairmanship of the party ' s powerful Military Commission to Jiang. // Deng did not say when Jiang would be considered capable enough to succeed him or how Jiang would be appointed . The oversights appear to substantiate the belief among many analysts that China will face a succession crisis when Deng dies. // Since Jiang was appointed party leader in June , Deng has tried to bolster the prestige of the younger leader while promoting him as his successor. // Deng ' s effort to strengthen Jiang ' s standing is particularly urgent , diplomats say . Deng has admitted that his ability to work and speak are declining because of his advanced age . Also , he has already scuttled two heirs apparent for resisting the harsh suppression of liberal activists. // Regardless of Deng ' s efforts , Jiang had virtually no experience in national politics before his sudden rise . He will find it difficult to fend off rivals after Deng ' s death , diplomats and other analysts say. // ' ' If I retire now and live on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am known to many people in the world and they take me into account in their relations with China , ' ' Deng told the six-member Standing Committee , President Yang Shangkun , and Wan Li , chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People ' s Congress. // Deng made the statement Sept. 4 , the day he submitted a resignation letter to the Politburo . In the letter , Deng said retirement was his ' ' long-cherished aspiration . ' ' Deng did not claim in the letter to retain any powers , but said only that he ' ' shall continue to be loyal to the cause of the party and the state. ' ' // Too , Deng pledged Nov. 13 , four days after the announcement of his retirement , that he would not meddle in the work of the party , state , and Army. // ' ' This is essential for their growth and work , ' ' Deng said , according to the official New China News Agency . Since his remarks , Deng has met with every major foreign visitor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Some details of Deng ' s Sept. 4 remarks have already emerged , but not his assertion that he will retain power. // Deng affirms in the secret address that he strongly supports Jiang as his successor . But he indicates that Jiang is still too weak to rule China . Referring to his own authoritarian powers , Deng says , ' ' Jiang Zemin should be the center of the collective leadership ' ' and ' ' give the final verdict on decisions. ' ' // However , Deng says Jiang is not yet qualified to assume supreme power . ' ' When Jiang Zemin eventually becomes such an authority , I will clap my hands , ' ' he says in the address , which was presented to party and state officials last month. // In an apparent sign of the increasing political power of the Army , Deng also acknowledged that Jiang has had little military experience . He called on senior military officers ' ' to help Jiang in his work. ' ' // Although saying he would retire in name only , Deng notes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has sought to lead his peers from their posts and enliven the party with younger officials. // ' ' When one grows old , one is likely to become obstinate . I have always warned myself against stubbornness . But sometimes I can ' t help it , ' ' Deng says. // As if refuting reports of a rivalry , Deng implies that he doesn ' t feel threatened by President Yang and is on good terms with the general . Many diplomats and other analysts believe that Deng views Mr. Yang as a leading political opponent. // Yang is the only person that Deng refers to in the remarks by his first name . Also , Deng says that Yang was reluctant to see his younger brother , Yang Baibing , promoted as secretary-general to the Military Commission. // Deng says he replied to Yang by quoting ' ' an ancient saying ( from the Tang Dynasty 618-907 AD ) : ' Don ' t hesitate to nominate one of your closest relatives to an important court post. ' ' ' // Yang was elevated last month to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is most likely to be Deng ' s successor , according to the analysts. // Finally , Deng extols Yang Baibing , saying ' ' considering his political awareness , ability , and impartiality , he is the best candidate for secretary-general. ' ' // At the same time , Deng also praises Liu Huaqing , who was promoted last month to the vice chairmanship of the Military Commission above Yang Baibing but below Yang Shangkun. // The promotion of Mr. Liu , along with the tapping of Jiang as commission chairman , was an effort by Deng to restrain the power of the Yang brothers , some analysts say. // Deng wields influence over Liu by virtue of Liu ' s former post as a commissar in the Second Field Army . Deng was once chief commissar of that force. // Deng noted in his Sept. 4 remarks that he has filled most senior posts in the military with veterans from the Second Field Army . These officers could help Deng repulse a putsch by the Yangs , analysts say. // //        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
