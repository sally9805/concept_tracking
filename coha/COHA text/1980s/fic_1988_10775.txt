 --  TOM CLANCYThe view changed to one of the high-resolution cameras . It peered first into a deep , mountainous valley where a river was held back by the concrete and stone mass of a hydroelectric dam . Though only fifty kilometers southeast of Dushanbe , its power lines did not serve that city of 500,000 . Instead they led to a collection of mountaintops almost within sight of the facility . " That looks like footings for another set of towers , " Ryan observed . " Parallel to the first set , " Graham agreed . " They 're putting some new generators into the facility . Well , we knew all along that they were only getting about half the usable power out of the dam . " " How long to bring the rest on-stream ? " Greer asked . " I 'd have to check with one of our consultants . It wo n't take more than a few weeks to run the power lines out , and the top half of the powerhouse is already built .

" They diverted people from two other hydro jobs . Both of them were Hero ' projects . This one has never been talked about , but they pulled construction troops off two high-profile sites to do this one . Ivan does know how to focus his effort when he wants to . Six or eight months is conservative , Dr. Ryan . It may be done quicker , " Graham said . " How much power 'll be available when they finish ? " " It 's not all that big a structure . Total peak output , with the new generators ? Figure eleven hundred megawatts . " " That 's a lot of power , and all going to those hilltops , " Ryan said almost to himself as the camera shifted again .

There were sixteen buildings . One was for apartments , the view from which must have been fantastic , though it was a prototypical Russian apartment building , as stylish and attractive as a cinderblock , finished six months before . A lot of engineers and their families lived in it . It seemed strange to see such a building there , but the message of the building was : The people who lived here were privileged . EnTHECARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  41gineers and academicians , people with enough skill that the State wanted to look after them and their needs . Food was trucked up the new mountain road  --  or , in bad weather , flown in . Another of the buildings was a theater . A third was a hospital .

That was also obvious from the perimeter fence and guard towers , both of which were recent . One of the identifiable things about Russian military complexes was the guard towers ; Ivan had a real fixation for the things . Three fences , with two ten-meter spaces enclosed . The outer space was usually mined , and the inner one patrolledby dogs . The towers were on the inner perimeter , spaced two hundred meters apart . The soldiers who manned the towers were housed in a better-than-average new concrete barracks " Can you isolate one of the guards ? " Jack asked . Graham spoke into his phone , and the picture changed . One of his technicians was already doing this , as much to test camera calibrationand ambient air conditions as for the purpose Ryan intended . As the camera zoomed in , a moving dot became a man-shape in greatcoat and probably a fur hat . He was walking a big dog of uncertain breed and had a Kalashnikov rifle slung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of vapor in the air as they breathed . Ryan leaned forward unconsciously , as though this would give him a better view . " That guy 's shoulder boards look green to you ? " he asked Graham . The reconnaissance expert grunted . " Yep . He 's KGB , all right . " " That close to Afghanistan ? " the Admiral mused . " They know we have people operating there . You bet they 'll take their security provisionsseriously . " " They must have really wanted those hilltops , " Ryan observed . " Seventy miles overland are a few million people who think killing Russians is God 's will . This place is more important than we thought . It is n't just a new facility , not with that kind of security . If that 's all it was , they would n't have had to put it here , and they for damned sure would n't have picked a place where they had to build a new power supply and risk exposure to hostiles . This may be an R and D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " Like what ? " 42  --  TOM CLANCY " Going after my satellites , maybe . " Art Graham thought of them as his . " Have they tickled any of ' em recently ? " Jack asked . " No , not since we rattled their cage last April . Common sense broke out for once . " That was an old story . Several times in the past few years , American reconnaissance and early-warning satellites had been " tickled "  --  laser beams or microwave energy had been fixused on the satellites , enough to dazzle their receptors but not enough to do serious harm . Why had the Russians done it ? That was the question . Was it merely an exercise to see how we 'd react , to see if it caused a ruckus at the North American Aerospace Defense Command  --  NORAD  --  at Cheyenne Mountain , Colorado ? An attempt to determine for themselveshow sensitive the satellites were ? Was it a demonstration , a warning of their ability to destroy the satellites ? Or was it simply what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to tell what the Soviets were thinking . They invariably protested their innocence , of course . When one American satellite had been temporarily blinded over Sary Shagan , they said that a natural-gas pipeline had caught fire . The fact that the nearby Chimkent-Pavlodar pipeline carried mostly oil had escapedthe Western press . The satellite pass was complete now . In a nearby room a score of videotape recorders were rewound , and now the complete camera coverage would be reviewed at leisure . " Let 's have a look at Mozart again , and Bach also , please , " Greer commanded . " Hell of a commute , " Jack noted . The residential and industrial site on Mozart was only one kilometer or so from the emplacement on Bach , the next mountaintop over , but the road looked frightful . The picture froze on Bach . The formula of fences and guard towers was repeated , but this time the distance between the outermost perimeterfence and the next was at least two hundred meters . Here the ground surface appeared to be bare rock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe they did n't , he thought . It was obvious that the ground had been leveled with bulldozers and explosivesto the unobstructed flatness of a pool table . From the guard towers , it must have looked like a shooting gallery . " Not kidding , are they ? " Graham observed quietly . " So that 's what they 're guarding . . . " Ryan said . There were thirteen buildings inside the fence . In an area perhaps the size of two football fields  --  which had also been leveled  --  were ten holes , in two groups . One was a group of six arranged hexagonally , each hole about thirty feet across . The second group of four was arrayed in a diamond pattern , and the holes were slightly smaller , perhaps twenty-five feet . In each hole was a concrete pillar about fifteen feet across , planted in bedrock , and every hole was at least forty feet deep  --  you could n't tell from the picture on the screen . Atop each pillar was a metal dome . They appeared to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder what 's in them ? " Graham asked rhetorically . There were two hundred people at Langley who knew of Dushanbe , and every one wanted to know what was under those metal domes . They 'd been in place for only a few months . " Admiral , " Jack said , " I need to kick open a new compartment . " " Which one ? " " Tea Clipper . " " You 're not asking much ! " Greer snorted . " I 'm not cleared for that . " Ryan leaned back in his chair . " Admiral , if what they 're doing in Dushanbe is the same thing we 're doing with Tea Clipper , we sure as hell ought to know . Goddammit , how are we supposed to know what to look for if we 're not told what one of these places looks like ! " " I 've been saying that for quite a while . " The DDI chuckled . " SDIO wo n't like it . The Judge will have to go to the President for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What if the activity here is connected with the arms proposal they just made ? " " Do you think it is ? " " Who can say ? " Jack asked . " It 's a coincidence . They worry me . " " Okay , I 'll talk to the Director . " Ryan drove home two hours later . He drove his Jaguar XJS out onto the George Washington Parkway . It was one of the many happy memories from his tour of duty in England . He loved the silkysmoothfeeling of the twelve-cylinder engine enough that he 'd put his venerable old Rabbit into semiretirement . As he always tried to44  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  45do , Ryan set his Washington business aside . He worked the car up through its five gears and concentrated on his driving . " Well , James ? " the Director of Central Intelligence asked . " Ryan thinks the new activity at Bach and Mozart may be related to the arms situation . I think he might be correct . He wants into Tea Clipper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . " Admiral Greer smiled . " Okay , I 'll get him a written note . It 'll make General Parks happier , anyway . They have a full-up test scheduled for the end of the week . I 'll set it up for Jack to see it . " Judge Moore smiled sleepily . " What do you think ? " " I think he 's right : Dushanbe and Tea Clipper are essentially the same project . There are a lot of coarse similarities , too many to be a pure coincidence . We ought to upgrade our assessment . " " Okay . " Moore turned away to look out the windows . The world is going to change again . It may take ten or more years , but it 's going to change . Ten years from now it wo n't be my problem , Moore told himself . But it sure as hell will be Ryan 's problem . " I 'll have him flown out there tomorrow . And maybe we 'll get lucky on Dushanbe .

Ever since the death of Dmitri Fedorovich , it has not been the same at the D e f e n s e M i n i s t r y , Colonel Mikhail Semvonovich 1 ilitov wrote into his diary left-handed . An early riser , he sat at a hundred-year-old oak desk that his wife had bought for him shortly before she 'd died , almost  --  what was it ? Thirty years , Misha told himself . Thirty years this coming February . His eyes closed for a moment . Thirty years . Never a single day passed that he did not remember his Elena . Her photograph was on the desk , the sepia print faded with age , its silver frame tarnished . He never seemed to have time to polish it , and did n't wish to be bothered with a staid . Tlw photo showed a young woman with legs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cocked to one side . The round , SlaviC tale displayed a wide , inviting smile that perfectly conveyed the joy she 'd felt when dancing with the Kirov Company . Misha smiled also as he remembered the first impression of a young armor officer given tickets to the performance as a reward for having the best-maintained tanks in the division : How can they do that ? Perched up on the tips of their toes as though on needle-point stilts . He 'd remembered playing on stilts as a child , but to be so graceful ! And then she 'd smiled at the handsome young officer in the front row . For the briefest moment . Their eyes had met for almost as little time as it takes to blink , he thought . Her smile had changed ever so slightly . Not for the audience any longer , for that timeless instant the smile had been for him alone . A bullet through the heart could not have had a more devastating effect . Misha did n't remember the rest of the performance  --  to this day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He remembered sitting and squirming through the rest of it while his mind churned over what he 'd do next . Already Lieutenant Filitov had been marked as a man on the move , a brilliant young tank officer for whom Stalin 's brutal purge of the officer corps had meant opportunity and rapid promotion . He wrote articles on tank tactics , practiced innovative battle drills in the field , argued vociferously against the false " lessons " of Spain with the certainty of a man born to his profession . But what do I do now ? he 'd asked himself . The Red Army had n't taught him how to approach an artist . This was n't some farm girl who was bored enough by work on the kolkhoz to offer herself to anyone  --  especially a young Army officer who might take her away from it all . Misha still remembered the shame of his youth  --  not that he 'd thought it shameful at the time  --  when he 'd used his officer 's shoulder boards to bed any girl who 'd caught his eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd told himself . What do I do ? What he 'd done , of course , was to treat the matter as a military exercise . As soon as the performance had ended , he 'd fought his way into the rest room and washed hands and face . Some grease that still remained under his fingernails was removed with a pocketknife . His short hair was wetted down into place , and he inspected his uniform as strictly as a general officer might , brushing off dust and picking off lint , stepping back from the mirror to make sure his boots gleamed as a soldier 's should . He had n't noticed at the time that other men in the men 's room were watching him with barely suppressed grins , having guessed what the drill was for , and wishing him luck , touched with a bit of envy . Satisfied with his appearance , Misha had left the46  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  47theater and asked the doorman where the artists ' door was . That had cost him a ruble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block to the stage entrance , where he found another doorman , this one a bearded old man whose greatcoat bore ribbons for service in the revolution . Misha had expected special courtesy from the doorman , one soldier to another , only to learn that he regarded all the female dancers as his own daughters  --  not wenches to be thrown at the feet of soldiers , certainly ! Misha had considered offering money , but had the good sense not to imply the man was a pimp . Instead , he 'd spoken quietly and reasonably  --  and truthfully  --  that he was smitten with a single dancer whose name he did n't know , and merely wanted to meet her . " Why ? " the old doorman had asked coldly . " Grandfather , she smiled at me , " Misha had answered in the awed voice of a little boy . " And you are in love . " The reply was harsh , but in a moment the doorman 's face turned wistful . " But you do n't know which ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important ones , I mean . What do they call that ?  --  I will remember her face until the day I die . " Already he 'd known that . The doorman looked him over and saw that his uniform was properly turned out , and his back straight . This was not a swaggering pig of an NKVD officer whose arrogant breath stank of vodka . This was a soldier , and a handsome young one at that . " Comrade Lieutenant , you are a lucky man . Do you know why ? You are lucky because I was once young , and old as I am , I still remember . They will start to come out in ten minutes or so . Stand over there , and make not a sound . " It had taken thirty minutes . They came out in twos and threes . Misha had seen the male members of the troupe and thought them  --  what any soldier would think of a man in a ballet company . His manhood had been offended that they held hands with such pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door opened , his vision was damaged by the sudden glare of yellow-white light against the near blackness of the unlit alley , and he 'd almost missed her , so different she lk x ) ked without the makeup . I lc saw the face , and tried to decide if she were the right one , . rppn . t. lung his objective more carefully than he would ever do under the fire oI German guns . " You were in seat number twelve , " she 'd said before he could summon the courage to speak . She had a voice ! " Yes , Comrade Artist , " his reply had stammered out . " Did you enjoy the performance , Comrade Lieutenant ? " A shy , but somehow beckoning smile . " It was wonderful ! " Of course . " It is not often that we see handsome young officers in the front row , " she observed . " I was given the ticket as a reward for performance in my unit . I am a tanker , " he said proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tanker Lieutenant have a name ? " " I am Lieutenant Mikhail Semyonovich Filitov . " " I am Elena Ivanova Makarova . " " It is too cold tonight for one so thin , Comrade Artist . Is there a restaurant nearby ? " " Restaurant ? " She 'd laughed . " How often do you come to Mos-cow ? " " My division is based thirty kilometers from here , but I do not often come to the city , " he 'd admitted . " Comrade Lieutenant , there are few restaurants even in Moscow . Can you come to my apartment ? " " Why  --  yes , " his reply had stuttered out as the stage door opened again . " Marta , " Elena said to the girl who was just coming out . " We have a military escort home ! " " Tania and Resa are coming , " Marta said . Misha had actually been relieved by that . The walk to the apartmenthad taken thirty minutes  --  the Moscow subway had n't yet been completed , and it was better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . She was far prettier without her makeup , Misha remembered . The cold winter air gave her cheeks all the color they ever needed . Her walk was as graceful as ten years of intensive training could make it . She 'd glided along the street like an apparition , while he gallumped along in his heavy boots . He felt himself a tank , rolling next to a thoroughbred horse , and was careful not to go too close , lest he trample her . He had n't yet learned of the strength that was so well hidden by her grace . The night had never before seemed so fine , though for  --  what was THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  4948  --  TOM CLANCYit ?  --  twenty years there had been many such nights , then none for the past thirty . My God , he thought , we would have been married fifty years this . . . July 14th . My God . Unconsciously he dabbed at his eyes with a handkerchief . Thirty years , however , was the number that occupied his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers were pale around the pen . It still surprised him that love and hate were emotions so finely matched . Misha returned to his diary . . . An hour later he rose from the desk and walked to the bedroom closet . He donned the uniform of a colonel of tank troops . Tech- nically he was on the retired list , and had been so before people on the current colonel 's list had been born . But work in the Ministry of Defense carried its own perks , and Misha was on the personal staff of the Minister . That was one reason . The other three reasons were on his uniform blouse , three gold stars that depended from claret-colored ribbons . Filitov was the only soldier in the history of the Soviet Army who 'd won the decoration of Hero of the Soviet Union three times on the field of battle , for personal bravery in the face of the enemy . There were others with such medals , but so often these were political awards , the Colonel knew . He was aesthetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be granted for staff work , and certainly not for one Party member to give to another as a gaudy lapel decoration . Hero of the Soviet Union was an award that ought to be limited to men like himself , who had risked death , who 'd bled  --  and all too often , died  --  for the Rodina . He was reminded of this every time he put his uniform on . Beneath his undershirt were the plastic-looking scars from his last gold star , when a German 88 round had lanced through the armor of his tank , setting the ammo racks afire while he 'd brought his 76mm gun around for one last shot and extinguished that Kraut gun crew while his clothing burned . The injury had left him with only fifty percent use of his right arm , but despite it , he 'd led what was left of his regiment nearly two more days in the Kursk Bulge . If he 'd bailed out with the rest of his crew  --  or been evacuated from the area at once as his regimental surgeon had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , he knew that he could not have not fired back , could not have aban- doned his men in the face of battle . And so he 'd shot , and burned . But for that Misha might have made General , perhaps even Marshal , he thought . Would it have made a difference ? Filitov was too much a man of the real , practical world to dwell on that thought for long . Had he fought in many more campaigns , he might have been killed . As it was , he 'd been given more time with Elena than could otherwise have been the case . She 'd come nearly every day to the burn institute in Moscow ; at first horrified by the extent of his wounds , she 'd later become as proud of them as Misha was . No one could question that her man had done his duty for the Rodina . But now , he did his duty for his Elena . Filitov walked out of the apartment to the elevator , a leather briefcase dangling from his right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body was good for . The babushka who operated the elevator greeted him as always . They were of an age , she the widow of a sergeant who 'd been in Misha 's regiment , who also had the gold star , pinned on his breast by this very man . " Your new granddaughter ? " the Colonel asked . " An angel , " was her reply . Filitov smiled , partly in agreement  --  was there any such thing as an ugly infant ?  --  and partly because terms like " angel " had survived seventy years of " scientific socialism . " The car was waiting for him . The driver was a new draftee , fresh from sergeant school and driving school . He saluted his Colonel severely , the door held open in his other hand . " Good morning , Comrade Colonel . " " So it is , Sergeant Zhdanov , " Filitov replied . Most officers would have done little more than grunt , but Filitov was a combat soldier whose success on the battlefield had resulted from his devotion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers ever understood , he reminded himself . Too bad . The car was comfortably warm , the heater had been turned all the way up fifteen minutes ago . Filitov was becoming ever more sensitive to cold , a sure sign of age . He 'd just been hospitalized again for pneumonia , the third time in the past five years . One of these times , he knew , would be the last . Filitov dismissed the thought . He 'd cheated death too many times to fear it . Life came and went at a constant rate . One brief second at a time . When the last second came , he wondered , would he notice ? Would he care ? The driver pulled the car up to the Defense Ministry before the Colonel could answer that question . Ryan was sure that he 'd been in government service too long . He had come to  --  well , not actually to like flying , but at least to appreciate50  --  TOM CLANCY the convenience of it . He was only four hours from Washington , flown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a captain , had looked like a high-school sophomore . Getting old , Jack , he told himself . The flight from the airfield to the mountaintop had been by helicopter , no easy feat at this altitude . Ryan had never been to New Mexico before . The high mountains were bare of trees , the air thin enough that he was breathing ab- normally , but the sky was so clear that for a moment he imagined himself an astronaut looking at the unblinking stars on this cloudless , frigid night . " Coffee , sir ? " a sergeant asked . He handed Ryan a thermos cup , and the hot liquid steamed into the night , barely illuminated by a sliver of new moon . " Thanks . " Ryan sipped at it and looked around . There were few lights to be seen . There might have been a housing development behind the next set of ridges ; he could see the halolike glow of Santa Fe , but there was no way to guess how far off it might be . He knew that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level ( the nearest level sea was hundreds of miles away ) , and there is no way to judge distance at night . It was altogether beautiful , except for the cold . His fingers were stiff around the plastic cup . He 'd mistakenly left his gloves at home . " Seventeen minutes , " somebody announced . " All systems are nom- inal . Trackers on automatic . AOS in eight minutes . " " AOS ? " Rvan asked . Ile realized that he sounded a little funny . It was so gold that his cheeks were stiff . " Au.Iuisition of Signal , " the Major explained .

Ryan thought back to the doe- =emu he 'd read on the way out and knew that this major probably could n't tell hint the color of the paint on his living-room wall . He really lived at Los Alamos National Laboratory , known locally as the Hill . Number one in his class at West Point , and a doctorate in highenergyphysics only two years after that . His doctor 's dissertation was classified Top Secret . Jack had read it , and did n't understand why they had bothered  --  despite a doctorate of his own , the twohundred-pagedocument might as well have been written in Kurdish . Alan Gregory was already being talked of in the same breath as Cambridge 's Stephen Hawking , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name . Jack wondered if anyone had thought of classifying that . " Major Gregory , all ready ? " an Air Force lieutenant general asked . Jack noted his respectful tone . Gregory was no ordinary major . A nervous smile . " Yes , sir . " The Major wiped sweaty handsdespitea temperature of fifteen below zero  --  on the pants of his uniform . It was good to see that the kid had emotions . " You married ? " Ryan asked . The file had n't covered that . " Engaged , sir . She 's a doctor in laser optics , on the Hill . We get married June the third . " The kid 's voice had become as brittle as glass . " Congratulations . Keeping it in the family , eh ? " Jack chuckled . " Yes , sir . " Major Gregory was still staring at the southwest horizon . " AOS ! " someone announced behind them . " We have signal . " " Goggles ! " The call came over the metal speakers . " Everyone put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the plastic goggles from his pocket . He 'd been told to stash them there to keep them warm . They were still cold enough on his face that he noticed the difference . Once in place , however , Ryan was effectively blinded .

" Initiate interrogationsequencing . . . first target is locked . . . auto firing circuits enabled . " There was no sound to indicate what had happened . Ryan did n't see anything  --  or did I ? he asked himself . There had been the fleeting impression of . . . what ? Did I imagine it ? Next to him he felt the Major 's breath come out slowly . " Exercise concluded , " the speaker said . Jack tore off his goggles. 52  --  TOM CLANCY " That 's all ? " What had he just seen ? What had they just done ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefed he did n't understand what was happening before his eyes ? " The laser light is almost impossible to see , " Major Gregory explained . " This high up , there is n't much dust or humidity in the air to reflect it . " " Then why the goggles ? " The young officer smiled as he took his off . " Well , if a bird flies over at the wrong time , the impact might be , well , kind of spectacular . That could hurt your eyes some . " Two hundred miles over their heads , Discovery continued toward the horizon . The shuttle would stay in orbit another three days , conducting its " routine scientific mission , " mainly oceanographical studies this time , the press was told , something secret for the Navy . The papers had been speculating on the mission for weeks . It had something to do , they said , with tracking missile submarines from orbit .

He looked up , but he could n't pick out the dot of light that denoted the billion-dollar space plane . " We have to see . " The Major turned and walked to the camouflagepaintedtruck van parked a few yards away . The three-star General followed him , with Ryan trailing behind . Inside the van , where the temperature might have been merely at freezing , a chief Nv , irrant officer was rewinding a videotape . " Where were the targets ? " Jack asked . " ' That was n't in the briefing papers . " " About tatty tiec south , thirty vest , " the General replied . Major ( itc  --  goty ryas lutthcd Ill 1t1 ) nt ( It the TV screen .

" I did n't know you could send it that far . " Major Gregory actually giggled . " Neither did we . " " So you sent the beam from over there to the shuttle 's mirror , from Discovery to this other one over the equator , and from there to the targets ? " " Correct , " the General said . " Your targeting system is on the other satellite , then ? " 54  --  TOM CLANCY " Yes , " the General answered more grudgingly . Jack did some numbers in his head .

" You had four hits and four misses  --  eight shots in under two seconds , and the Major said the targeting system corrected for misses . Okay , if those had been SS-18s launched off of South Georgia , would the shots have killed them ? " " Probably not , " Gregory admitted . " The laser assembly only puts out five megajoules . Do you know what a joule is ? " " I checked my college phyzzies book before I flew down . A joule is one newton-meter per second , or zero-point-seven foot-pounds of energy , plus change , right ? Okay , a megajoule is a million of them . . . seven hundred thousand foot-pounds . In terms I can un-derstand  --  " " A megajoule is the rough equivalent of a stick of dynamite . So we just delivered five sticks . The actual energy transferred is like a kilogram of explosives , but the physical effects are not exactly com-parable . " " What you 're telling me is that the laser beam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more of a shock effect . " Ryan was stretching his technical knowledge to the limit . " We call it an impact kill , ' " the General answered . " But , yeah , that 's about it . All the energy arrives in a few millionths of a second , a lot faster than any bullet does . " " So . ill that stuff I 've heard about how polishing the missile body , or rot.11ing It , k1111 prevent a burn-through - " Nl.tlot Gtegory giggled again . " Yeah , I like that one . A ballet danker k an pnolu  --  tte in front of a shotgun and it 'll do her about as nni h good What happens is that the energy has to go somewhere , and that pan only he mto the missile body . The missile body is full of stot.iblc liquids nearly all of their birds are liquid fueled , right ? The hvdtost.itk efiekt alone will be to rupture the pressure tankskaIwom ! no mote missile . " The Major smiled as though describing a trek pl.nved on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , I want to know how it all works . " " I.4w-k , I ) i . Ryan  --  " the General started to say . Jack cut himTHE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  55 " General , I am cleared for Tea Clipper . You know that , so let 's stop screwing around . " Major Gregory got a nod from the General . " Sir , we have five one-megajoule lasers  --  " " Where ? " " You 're standing right on top of one of them , sir . The other four are buried around this hilltop . The power rating is per pulse , of course . Each one puts out a pulse-chain of a million joules in a few microseconds  --  a few millionths of a second . " " And they recharge in . . . ? " " Point zero-four-six seconds . We can deliver twenty shots per second , in other words . " " But you did n't shoot that fast . " " We did n't have to , sir , " Gregory replied . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being worked on . The purpose of this test was to evaluate part of the software package . We know that these lasers work . We 've had them here for the past three years . The laser beams are converged on a mirror about fifty meters that way "  --  he pointed  --  " and converted into a single beam . " " They have to be  --  I mean , the beams all have to be exactly in tune , right ? " " Technically it 's called a Phased-Array Laser . All the beams have to be perfectly in phase , " Gregory answered . " How the hell do you do that ? " Ryan paused . " Do n't bother , I probably would n't understand it anyway . Okay , we have the beam hitting the downside mirror ... " " The mirror is the special part . It 's composed of thousands of segments , and every segment is controlled by a piezoelectric chip . That 's called adaptive optics . ' We send an interrogation beam to the mirror  --  this one was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The way the atmosphere bends the beam is analyzed by computer . Then the mirror corrects for the distortion , and we fire the real shot . The mirror on the shuttle also has adaptive optics . It collects and focuses the beam , and sends it off to the Flying Cloud ' satellite mirror . That mirror refocuses the beam on the targets . Zap ! " " That simple ? " Ryan shook his head . It was simple enough that over the previous nineteen years , forty billion dollars had gone into basic research , in twenty separate fields , just to run this one test. 56  --  TOM CLANCY " We did have to iron out a few little details , " Gregory acknowledged . These little details would take another five or more years , and he neither knew nor cared how many additional billions . What matteredto him was that the goal was now actually in sight . Tea Clipper was n't a blue-sky project anymore , not after this system test . " And you 're the guy who made the breakthrough on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam to provide its own targeting information . " " Something like that , " the General answered for the kid . " Dr. Ryan , that part of the system is classified highly enough that we will not discuss it further without written authorization . " " General , the purpose in my being here is to evaluate this program relative to Soviet efforts along similar lines . If you want my people to tell you what the Russians are up to , I have to know what the hell we 're supposed to look for ! " This did not elicit a reply . Jack shrugged and reached inside his coat . He handed the General an envelope . Major Gregory looked on in puzzlement . " You still do n't like it , " Ryan observed after the officer folded the letter away . " No , sir , I do n't . " Ryan spoke with a voice colder than the New Mexico night . " General , when I was in the Marine Corps , they never told me that I was supposed to like my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That almost set the General off , and Jack added : " I really am on your side , sir . " " You ntay continue , Major Gregorv , " General Parks said after a numtcnt " I k all the algorithm ' Fan Dance , ' " Gregory began . The General almost smiled in spite of himself . Gregory could not have known anthutg . rb ( nut ally Rand . " ' Hut 's . ill ? " Ryan said again when the youngster finished , and he knew that every computer expert in Project Tea Clipper must have asked himself t hr same thing : Why did n't I think of that ! No wonder they all say that Gregory is a genius . He 'd made a crucial breakflu()ugh in laser technology at Stony Brook , then one in software design . " tut that 's simple ! " " 1'rs , sir , but it took over two years to make it work , and a Cray-2 tomputer to make it work fast enough to matter . We still need aTHE CARDINAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we analyze what went wrong tonight , another four or five months , maybe , and we got it knocked . " " Next step , then ? " " Building a five-megajoule laser . Another team is close to that already . Then we gang up twenty of them , and we can send out a hundred-megajoule pulse , twenty times per second , and hit any target we want . The impact energy then will be on the order of , say , twenty to thirty kilograms of explosives . " " And that 'll kill any missile anybody can make ... " " Yes , sir . " Major Gregory smiled . " What you 're telling me is , the thing  --  Tea Clipper works . " " We 've validated the system architecture , " the General corrected Ryan . " It 's been a long haul since we started looking at this system . Five years ago there were eleven hurdles . There are three technical hurdles left . Five years from now there wo n't be any . Then we can start building it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryan said , and stopped . " Jesus . " " It 's going to change the world , " the General agreed . " You know that they 're playing with the same thing at Dushanbe . " " Yes , sir , " Major Gregory answered . " And they might know somethingthat we do n't . " Ryan nodded . Gregory was even smart enough to know that someoneelse might be smarter . This was some kid . " Gentlemen , out in my helicopter is a briefcase . Could you have somebody bring it in ? There are some satellite photos that you might find interesting . " " How old are these shots ? " the General asked five minutes later as he leafed through the photos . " A couple of days , " Jack replied . Major Gregory peered at them for a minute or so . " Okay , we have two slightly different installations here . It 's called a sparse array . ' The hexagonal array  --  the six-pillar one  --  is a transmitter . The buildingin the middle here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optically stable mounts for mirrors . The laser beams come out of the building , reflect off the mirrors , and the mirrors are computer-controlledto concentrate the beam on a target . " " What do you mean by optically stable ? " " The mirrors have to be controlled with a high degree of accuracy , 58  --  TOM CLANCYsir , " Gregory told Ryan . " By isolating them from the surrounding ground you eliminate vibration that might come from having a man walk nearby , or driving a car around . If you jiggle the mirrors by a small multiple of the laser-light frequency , you mess up the effect you 're trying to get . Here we use shock mountings to enhance the isolation factor . It 's a technique originally developed for submarines . Okay ? This other diamond-shaped array is . . . oh , of course . That 's the receiver . " " What ? " Jack 's brain had just met another stone wall . " Let 's say you want to make a really good picture of something . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strobe light . " " But why four mirrors ? " " It 's easier and cheaper to make four small mirrors than one big one , " Gregory explained . " Hmph . I wonder if they 're trying to do a holographic image . If they can really lock their illuminating beams in phase . . . theoretically it 's possible . There are a couple of things that make it tricky , but the Russians like the brute-force approach . . . Damn ! " His eyes lit up . " That 's one hell of an interesting idea ! I 'll have to think about that one . " " You 're telling me that they build this place just to take pictures of our satellites ? " Ryan demanded . " No , sir . They can use it for that , no sweat . It makes a perfect cover . And a system that can image a satellite at geosynchronous altitude might be able to clobber one in low earth orbit . If you think of these four mirrors here as a telescope , renumber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or part of a gunsight . It could also make a dunned efficient aiming sv.Stenl . I low much power runs into this lab ? " Ryan set down a photo . " The current power output from this dam is sOmethllll ; like five hundred megawatts . But  --  " " ' IIicy 're Stringing new power lines , " Gregory observed . " How wine ) " - The powerhouse is two stories  --  you ca n't tell from this angle . It looks like they 're activating the top half . That 'll bring their peak lx+wer nit put to something like eleven hundred megawatts. " " 1 h ) W much collies into this place ? " "  --  ' e tall it ' Bach . ' Mavbe a hundred . The rest goes to Mozart , ' the town that grew up on the next hill over . So they 're doubling their available power . " THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  59 " More than that , sir , " Gregory noted . " Unless they 're going to double the size of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power is just going to the lasers ? " Jack nearly choked . Why the hell did n't you think of that ! he growled at himself . " I mean , " Gregory continued , " I mean . . . that 's like five hundred megawatts of new power . Jesus , what if they just made a breakthrough ? How hard is it to find out what 's happening there ? " " Take a look at the photos and tell me how easy you think it would be to infiltrate the place , " Ryan suggested . " Oh . " Gregory looked up . " It would be nice to know how much power they push out the front end of their instruments . How long has this place been there , sir ? " " About four years , and it 's not finished yet . Mozart is new . Until recently the workers were housed in this barracks and support facility . We took notice when the apartment building went up , same time as the perimeter fence . When the Russians start pampering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really high priority . If it has a fence and guard towers , we know it 's military . " " How did you find it ? " Gregory asked . " By accident . The Agency was redrawing its meteorological data on the Soviet Union , and one of the technicians decided to do a computer analysis of the best places over there for astronomical observation . This is one of them . The weather over the last few months has been unusually cloudy , but on average the skies are about as clear there as they are here . The same is true of Sary Shagan , Semipalatinsk , and another new one , Storozhevaya . " Ryan set out some more photographs . Gregory looked at them . " They sure are busy . " " Good morning , Misha , " Marshal of the Soviet Union Dmitri Timofeyevich Yazov said . " And to you , Comrade Defense Minister , " Colonel Filitov replied . A sergeant helped the Minister off with his coat while another brought in a tray with a tea setting . Both withdrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what does my day look like ? " Yazov poured two cups of tea . It was still dark outside the Council of Ministers building . The inside perimeter of the Kremlin walls was lit with harsh blue-60  --  TOM CLANCYwhite floods , and sentries appeared and disappeared in the splashes of light . " A full one , Dmitri Timofeyevich , " Misha replied . Yazov was n't the man that Dmitri Ustinov was , but Filitov had to admit to himself that he did put in a full day 's work as a uniformed officer should . Like Filitov , Marshal Yazov was by background a tank officer . Though they had never met during the war , they did know one another by reputation . Misha 's was better as a combat officer  --  purists claimed that he was an old-fashioned cavalryman at heart , though Filitov cordially hated horses  --  while Dmitri Yazov had won a reputation early on as a brilliant staff officer and organizer  --  and a Party man , of course . Before everything else , Yazov was a Party man , else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have that delegation coming in from the experimental station in the Tadzhik SSR . " " Ah , Bright Star . ' Yes , that report is due today , is n't it ? " " Academicians , " Misha snorted . " They would n't know what a real weapon was if I shoved it up their asses . " " The time for lances and sabers is past , Mikhail Semyonovich , " Yazov said with a grin . Not the brilliant intellect that Ustinov had been , neither was Yazov a fool like his predecessor , Sergey Sokolov . His lack of engineering expertise was balanced by an uncanny instinct for the merits of new weapons systems , and rare insights into the people of the Soviet Army . " These inventions show extraordinary promise . " " Of course . I only wish that we had a real soldier running the project instead of these starrv-eyed professors . " " Brit General Pukrshkin  - -  -  " " f Ie was a fighter pilot . I said a soldier , Comrade Minister . Pilots Will support anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent more time in universities of late than in an aircraft . ' rho . do n't even let him fly himself anymore . Pokryshkin stopped being a soldier ten sears ago . Now he is the procurer for the sii.ards . " And he is binildim his own little empire down there , but that ' 3 an issue ri'e 'll save . Pr another day . " You wish a new job assignment , Misha ? " Yazov inquired slyly . " Not that one ! " l ilito laughed , then turned serious . " What I am trying to s.iy , Dmitri Timofeyevich , is that the progress assessment we get front Bright Star is  --  how do I say this ?  --  warped by the fact that we do n't have a real military man on the scene . Someone whoTHE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  61understands the vagaries of combat , someone who knows what a weapon is supposed to be . " The Defense Minister nodded thoughtfully . " Yes , I see your point . They think in terms of instruments ' rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the project concerns me . " " Just how many moving parts does this new assembly have ? " " I have no idea  --  thousands , I should think . " " An instrument does not become a weapon until it can be handled realiably by a private soldier  --  well , at least a senior lieutenant . Has anyone outside the project ever done a reliability assessment ? " Filitov asked . " No , not that I can recall . " Filitov picked up his tea . " There you are , Dmitri Timofeyevich . Do n't you think that the Politburo will be interested in that ? Until now , they have been willing to fund the experimental project , of course , but "  --  Filitov took a sip  --  " they are coming here to request funding to upgrade the site to operational status , and we have no independent assessment of the project . " " How would you suggest we get that assessment ? " " Obviously I can not do it . I am too old , and too uneducated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the signals section . They are not combat officers , strictly speaking , but they are soldiers , and they are competent to look at these electronic marvels . It is only a suggestion . " Filitov did n't press . He had planted the seed of an idea . Yazov was far easier to manipulate than Ustinov had ever been . " And what of the problems at the Chelyabinsk tank works ? " Yazov asked next . Ortiz watched the Archer climbing the hill half a mile away . Two men and two camels . They probably would n't be mistaken for a guerrilla force the way that twenty or so would have . Not that this had to matter , Ortiz knew , but the Soviets were to the point now that they attacked almost anything that moved . Vaya con Dios . " I sure could use a beer , " the Captain observed . Ortiz turned . " Captain , the thing that allowed me to deal with these people effectively is that I live the way they do . I observe their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no pork ; that means I do n't fool with their women . " 62  --  TOM CLANCY " Shit . " The officer snorted . " These ignorant savages  --  " Ortiz cut him off . " Captain , the next time I hear you say that , or even think it real loud , will be your last day here . These people are working for us . They 're bringing us stuff that we ca n't get any place else . You will , repeat will treat them with the respect they deserve . Is that clear ! " " Yes , sir . " Christ , this guy 's turned into a sand nger himself. 3 . The Weary Red FoxC ' I T 's impressive  --  if you can figure out what they 're doing . " Jack yawned . He 'd taken the same Air Force transport back to Andrews from Los Alamos , and was behind in his sleep again . For all the times this had happened to him , he 'd never quite learned to deal with it . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two seconds to identify the Bach in- stallation , practically word for word with the NPIC assessment . " The difference was that the photointerpreters at the National Photo- graphic Intelligence Center had taken four months and three written reports to get it right . " You think he belongs in the assessment team ? " " Sir , that 's like asking if you want to have surgeons in the operating room . Oh , by the way , he wants us to infiltrate somebody into Bach . " Ryan rolled his eyes . Admiral Greer nearly dropped his cup . " That kid must watch ninja movies . " " It is nice to know that somebody believes in us . " Jack chuckled , then turned serious . " Anyway , Gregory wants to know if they 've made a breakthrough in laser power output  --  excuse me , I think the new term is throughput . ' He suspects that most of the new power from the hydroelectric dam will go to Bach . " 64  --  TOM CLANCY Greer 's eyes narrowed . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " They 've got a lot of good people in lasers , sir . Nikolay Bosov , remember , won the Nobel Prize , and he 's been in laser-weapons research ever since , along with Yevgeniy Velikhov , noted peace ac- twist , and the head of the Laser Institute is Dmitri Ustinov 's son , for God 's sake . Site Bach is almost certainly a sparse array laser . We need to know what kind of lasers , though  --  could be gas-dynamic , free electron , chemical . He thinks it 'll be the free electron kind , but that 's just a guess . He gave me figures to establish the advantage of putting the laser assembly on this hilltop , where it 's above about half of the atmosphere , and we know how much energy it takes to do some of the things they want to do . He said he 'd try to do some backwards computations to estimate the total power of the system . The figures will be on the conservative side . Between what Gregory said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to assume that this site is intended to go into formal test and evaluation in the near future , maybe operational in two or three years . If so , Ivan may soon have a laser that can snuff one of our satellites right out of business . Probably a soft kill , the Major says  --  it 'll smoke the camera receptors and the photovoltaic cells . But the next step  --  " " Yeah . We 're in a race , all right . " " What are the chances that Ritter and the Operations people can find out something inside one of those Bach-site buildings ? " " I suppose we can discuss the possibility , " Greer said diffidently , and changed the subject . " You look a little ragged . " Ryan got the message : he did n't need to know what Operations had in mind . He could talk like a normal person now . " All this traveling around has been pretty tiring . If you do n't mind , sir , I 'd just as soon take the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tomorrow . But first  --  Jack ? I got a call about you from the Securities and Exchange Commission . " " Oh . " Jack bowed his head . " I forgot all about that . They called me right before I flew to Moscow . " " What gives ? " " One of the companies I own stock in , the officers are being investigated for insider trading . I bought some of it right when they did , and SEC wants to know how I decided to buy it just then . " " And ? " Greer asked . CIA had had enough scandals , and the Admiraldid n't want one in his office . " I got a tip that it might be an interesting company , and when I checked it out I saw that the company was buying itself back . So what got me to buy in was that I saw they were buying in . That 's legal , boss . I have all the records at home . I do all this by computerwell , I do n't since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies of everything . I did n't break any rules , sir , and I can prove it . " " Let 's try to settle that in the next few days , " Greer suggested . " Yes , sir . " Jack was in his car five minutes later . The drive home to Peregrine Cliff was easier than usual , taking only fifty minutes instead of the usual seventy-five . Cathy was at work , as usual , and the kids were at school  --  Sally at St. Mary 's and Jack at kindergarten . Ryan poured himself a glass of milk in the kitchen . Finished , he wandered upstairs , kicked off his shoes , and collapsed into bed without even bothering to take off his pants . Colonel of Signal Troops Gennady losifovich Bondarenko sat across from Misha , straight of back and proud , as so young a field-grade officer should be . He did not show himself to be the least intimidated by Colonel Filitov , who was old enough to be his father , and whose background was a minor legend in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who fought in nearly every tank battle in the first two years of the Great Patriotic War . He saw the toughness around the eyes that age and fatigue could never erase , noted the impairment to the Colonel 's arm , and remembered how that had happened . It was said that Old Misha still went out to the tank factories with some of the men from his old regiment , to see for himself if quality control was up to standards , to make certain that his hard blue eyes could still hit a target from the gunner 's seat . Bondarenko was somewhat in awe of this soldier 's soldier . More than anything else , he was proud to wear the same uniform . " How may I serve the Colonel ? " he asked Misha . " Your file says that you are very clever with electronic gadgets , Gennady losifovich . " Filitov waved at the file folder on his desk . " That is my job , Comrade Colonel . " Bondarenko was more than just " clever , " and both knew it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until recently had been engaged in a66  --  TOM CLANCY project to use lasers in place of radios for secure front-line coin- munications . " What we are about to discuss is classified Most Secret . " The young Colonel nodded gravely and Filitov went on . " For the past several years the Ministry has been financing a very special laser project called Bright Star  --  the name itself is also classified , of course . Its primary mission is to make high-quality photographs of Western satellites , though when fully developed , it may be able to blind them  --  at a time when such action is politically necessary . The project is run by academicians and a former fighter pilot from Voyska PVO  --  this sort of installation comes under the authority of the air-defense forces , unfortunately . I would have preferred myself that a real soldier was running it , but  --  " Misha stopped and gestured at the ceiling . Bon- darenko smiled in agreement . Politics , they both communicated si- lently . No wonder we never get anything done . " The Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ons potential of the site , particularly from a reliability standpoint . If we are to bring this site to operational status , it would be well to know if the damned-fool thing will work when we want it to . " The young officer nodded thoughtfully while his mind raced . This was a choice assignment  --  much more than that . He would report to the Minister through his most trusted aide . If he did well , he would have the personal stamp of the Minister in his personnel jacket . That would guarantee him general 's stars , a bigger apartment for his family , a good education for his children , so many of the things he 'd worked all these years for . " Comrade Colonel , I presume that they know of my corning ? " Misha laughed derisively . " Is that the way the Red Army does it now ? We tell them when they are to be inspected ! No , Gennady Iosifovich , if we are to evaluate reliability , we do it by surprise . I have a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be sufficient to get you past security  --  site security comes under our KGB colleagues , " Misha said coolly . " It will give you free access to the entire facility . If you have any difficulty at all , call me at once . I can always be reached through this number . Even if I am in the banya , my driver will come and fetch me . " " How detailed an evaluation is required , Comrade Colonel ? " " Enough that a weary old tanker like me can understand what their witchcraft is all about , " Misha said humorlessly . " Do you think you can understand it all ? " " If not , I will so inform you , Comrade Colonel . " It was a very good answer , Misha noted . Bondarenko would go far . " Excellent , Gennady Iosifovich . I would much rather have an officertell me what he does not know than try to impress me with a truckload of mudnya . " Bondarenko got that message loud and clear . It was said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers who 'd tried to bullshit their way past this man . " How soon can you leave ? " " This is an extensive installation ? " " Yes . It houses four hundred academicians and engineers , and perhaps six hundred other support personnel . You can take up to a week doing your evaluation . Speed here is less important than thor-oughness . " " Then I 'll have to pack another uniform . I can be on my way in two hours . " " Excellent . Off with you . " Misha opened a new file . As was generally the case , Misha worked a few minutes later than his Minister . He locked his personal documents in secure files and had the rest picked up by a messenger whose cart wheeled them to Central Files a few meters down the main corridor from his office . The same messenger handed over a note saying that Colonel Bondarenkohad taken the 1730 Aeroflot flight to Dushanbe , and that ground transport from the civil airport to Bright Star had been arranged . Filitov made a mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Ministry 's in-house General Inspectorate , he could have requisitioned special transport and flown directly to the city 's military airfield , but the security office at Bright Star undoubtedly had some of its people there to report the arrival of such a flight . This way , however , a colonel from Moscow could just as easily be mistaken for what colonels in Moscow usually weremessengerboys . That fact offended Filitov . A man who had worked hard enough to attain the rank of a regimental commander  --  which really was the best job in any army  --  should not be a staff slave who fetched drinks for his general . But he was sure that this was a fact in any military headquarters . At least Bondarenko would have a chance to try out his teeth on the feather merchants down in Tadzhikistan . Filitov rose and reached for his coat . A moment later , briefcase dangling from his right hand , he walked out of the office . His sec-68  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  69retary  --  a warrant officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was waiting when Misha walked out the front door . Forty minutes later , Filitov was in soft clothes . The television was on , broadcasting something mindless enough to have been imported from the West . Misha sat alone at his kitchen table . There was an open half-liter bottle of vodka beside his evening meal . Misha ate sausage , black bread , and pickled vegetables , not very different from what he 'd eaten in the field with his men , two generations before . He 'd found that his stomach dealt more easily with rough foods than the fancy ones , a fact that had thoroughly confused the hospital staff during his last bout of pneumonia . After every other bite , he 'd take a brief sip of vodka , staring out the windows , whose blinds were adjusted just so . The city lights of Moscow burned brightly , along with the numberless yellow rectangles of apartment windows . He could remember the smells at will . The verdant odor of good Russian earth , the fine , green smell of meadow grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the acidic reek of propellant from the tank 's guns that stayed in the cloth of your coveralls no matter how many times you tried to wash it out . For a tanker , that was the smell of combat , that and the uglier smell of burning vehicles , and burning crews . Without looking , he lifted the sausage and cut off a piece , bringing it to his mouth atop the knife . He was staring out the window , but as though it were a television screen , what he saw was the vast , distant horizon at sunset , and columns of smoke rising along the perimeter of green and blue , orange and brown . Next , a bite of the rich , thickly te ! urcd black bread . And as always on the nights bcti ) rc he , omnutted treason , the ghosts came back to visit. 11'r %bowed thou , dul n't we , ( ' omrade ( ' r ; ptain ? a weary voice asked 11'r stall hail to retreat , Caporal , he heard his own voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to to/le with our T-34s .

Indeed , ( ' unmade The corixrral chuckled . From behind , a bottle gas h.mdcd do11n Not State-produced vodka , this was Samogan , the Russi.ur IN s rtleg liquor that Misha himself knew well . Every true Russian Lamed to love the taste , though not one would touch it if vodka was handy . Nevertheless , for this moment Samogan was thedrink he craved , out here on Russian soil , with the remains of his tank troop standing between a State farm and the leading elements of Guderian 's panzers . They 'll be coming again tomorrow morning , the driver thought soberly . And we 'll kill some more slug-gray tanks , the loader said . After which , Misha did not say aloud , we 'll withdraw another ten kilometers . Ten kilometers only  --  if we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things better than they did this afternoon . In either case , this farm will be behind German lines when tomorrow 's sun sets . More ground lost . It was not a thought on which to dwell . Misha wiped his hands carefully before unbuttoning the pocket on his tunic . It was time to restore his soul . A delicate one , the corporal observed as he looked over his Captain 's shoulder at the photograph for the hundredth time , and as always , with envy . Delicate like crystalglass . And such a fine son you have . Lucky for you , Comrade Captain , that he has his mother 's looks . She is so tiny , your wife , how can she have had such a big boy as that and not be hurt by it ? God knows , was his unconscious reply . So strange that after a few days of war even the most adamant atheist invoked the name of God . Even a few of the commissars , to the quiet amusement of the troops . I will come home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home to you . Through all the German Army , through all the fires of hell , I will come home to you , Elena . Just then mail had come , a rare-enough occurrence at the front . Only one letter for Captain Filitov , but the texture of the paper and the delicate handwriting told him of its importance . He slit the envelope open with the bright edge of his combat knife and extracted the letter as carefully as his haste allowed so as not to soil the words of his love with grease from his battle tank . Seconds later he leaped to his feet and screamed at the stars in the twilight sky . I will be a father again in the spring ! It must have been that last night on leave , three weeks before this brutal madness began .. . I am not surprised , the corporal observed lightly , after the fucking we gave the Germans today . Such a man leads this troop ! Perhaps our Captain should stand at stud . You are nekulturny , Corporal Romanov . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Comrade Captain 's stead ? he asked hopefully , then handed the bottle down again . To another fine son , my Captain , and to the health of your Beautiful wife . There were tears of joy in the young man 's eyes , along with the grief that came with the knowledge that only the greatest good fortune would ever allow him to be a father . But he would never say such a thing . A fine soldier Romanov was , and a fine comrade , ready tier command of his own tank . And Romanov had gotten his own tank , Misha remembered , staring at the Moscow skyline . At Vyasma , he 'd defiantly placed it between his Captain 's disabled T-34 and an onrushing German MarkIV , saving his Captain 's life as his own ended in red-orange flames . Aleksey Il'ych Romanov , Corporal of the Red Army , won an Order of the Red Banner that day . Misha wondered if it was fair compensationto his mother for her blue-eyed , freckled son . The vodka bottle was three-quarters empty now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing , alone at his table . So many deaths . Those fools at High Command ! Romanov killed at Vyasma . Ivanenko lost outside Moscow . Lieutenant Abashin at Kharkov Mirka , the handsome young poet , the slight , sensitive young officer who had the heart and balls of a lion , killed leading the fifth counterattack , but clearing the way for Misha to extract what was left of his regiment across the Donets before the hammer fell . And his Elena , the last victim of all . . . All of them killed not by an external enemy , but by the misguided , indifferent brutality of their own MotherlandMisha took a long last swallow from the bottle . No , not the Motherland . Not the Rodina , never the Rodina . By the inhuman bastards who .. . He rose and staggered toward the . bedroom , leaving on the lights in his sitting room . The clock on the nightstand said quarter of ten , and some distant part of Misha 's brain took comfort in the fact that he 'd get nine hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on what had once been a lean , hard body , one that had enduredeventhrived on  --  the ghastly strain of prolonged combat operations . But the stress Misha endured now made combat seem a vacation , and his subconscious rejoiced in the knowledge that this would soon end , and rest would finally come . About a half hour later , a car drove down the street . In the passenger'sseat , a woman was driving her son home from a hockey game . She looked up and noted that the lights in certain windows were on , and the shades adjusted just so . The air was thin . Bondarenko arose at 0500 , as he always did , put on his sweatsuit , and took the elevator downstairs from his guest quarters on the tenth floor . It took him a moment to be surprisedtheelevators were operating . So the technicians travel back and forth to the facility round the clock . Good , the Colonel thought . He walked outside , a towel wrapped around his neck , and checked his watch . He frowned as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a measured path around the city blocks . Here he could n't be sure of the distance , when his five kilometers ended . Well  --  he shrugged  --  that was to be expected . He started off heading east . The view , he saw , was breathtaking . The sun would soon rise , earlier than Moscow because of the lower latitude , and the jagged spires of mountains were outlined in red , like dragons ' teeth , he smiled to himself . His youngest son liked to draw pictures of dragons . The flight in had ended spectacularly . The full moon had illuminatedthe Kara Kum desert flatlands under the aircraft  --  and then these sandy wastes had ended as though at a wall built by the gods . Within three degrees of longitude , the land had changed from **26;16138;TOOLONG to five-thousand-meter peaks . From his vantagepoint he could see the glow of Dushanbe , about seventy kilometersto the northwest . Two rivers , Kafirnigan and Surkhandarya , bordered the city of half a million , and like a man halfway around the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient history had caused it to grow between the two mountain-fedrivers . Certainly it seemed an inhospitable place , but perhaps the long caravans of Bactrian camels had rested here , or perhaps it had been a crossroads , or  --  He stopped his reverie . Bondarenko knew that he was merely putting off his morning exercise . He tied the surgical mask over his mouth and nose as a protection against the frigid air . The Colonel began his deep knee-bends to loosen up , then stretched his legs against the building wall before he started off at an easy , double-time pace . Immediately he noticed that he was breathing more heavily than usual through the cloth mask over his face . The altitude , of course. 72  --  TOM CLANCY Well , that would shorten his run somewhat . The apartment building was already behind him , and he looked to his right , passing what his map of the facility indicated to be machine and optical shops . " Halt ! " a voice called urgently . Bondarenko growled to himself . He did n't like having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone with the green shoulder boards of the KGB . Spies  --  thugs  --  playing at soldiers . " Well , what is it , Sergeant ! " " Your papers , if you please , Comrade . I do not recognize you . " Fortunately , Bondarenko 's wife had sewn several pockets onto the Nike jogging suit that she 'd managed to get on the gray market in Moscow , a present for his last birthday . He kept his legs pumping as he handed over his identification . " When did the Comrade Colonel arrive ? " the sergeant asked . " And what do you think you are doing so early in the morning ? " " Where is your officer ? " Bondarenko replied . " At the main guard post , four hundred meters that way . " The sergeant pointed . " Then come along with me , Sergeant , and we will speak with him . A colonel of the Soviet Army does not explain himself to sergeants . Come on , you need exercise , too ! " he challenged and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wore a heavy greatcoat and carried a rifle and ammo belt . Within two hundred meters , Gennady heard him puffing . " I Jere , Comrade Colonel , " the voting man gasped a minute later . " 1'ou should not smoke so much , Sergeant , " londarenko oh- served . " What the hell is going on here ? " a KGB lieutenant asked from behind his desk . " Your sergeant ( ltallengcd inc . I am Colonel G. I. Bondarenko , and I . tin doing my morning run . " " In Western k lo thing ? " " What the hell do you care what clothes I wear when I exercise ? " Idiot , do vuu think . iptrs jqg ? " Colonel , I ant the security watch officer .

If you have any further questions , you may call him directly at that number ! " The KGB Lieutenant scrupulously read the identification documentsto make sure they said what he 'd been told . " Please excuse me , Comrade Colonel , but we have orders to take our security provisions seriously . Also , it is out of the ordinary to see a man in Western clothes running at dawn . " " I gather that it is out of the ordinary for your troops to run at all , " Bondarenko noted dryly . " There is hardly room on this mountaintop for a proper regime of physical training , Comrade Colonel . " " Is that so ? " Bondarenko smiled as he took out a notebook and pencil . " You claim to take your security duties seriously , but you do not meet norms for physical training of your troops . Thank you for that piece of information , Comrade Lieutenant . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go ? " " Technically , I have orders to provide escort for all official visitors . " " Excellent . I like to have company when I run . Will you be so kind as to join me , Comrade Lieutenant ? " The KGB officer was trapped , and knew it . Five minutes later , he was puffing like a landed fish . " What is your main security threat ? " Bondarenko asked himmaliciously , since he did not slow down . " The Afghan border is one hundred eleven kilometers that way , " the Lieutenant said between wheezes . " They have occasionally sent some of their bandit raiders into Soviet territory , as you may have heard . " " Do they make contact with local citizens ? " " Not that we have established , but that is a concern . The local population is largely Muslim . " The Lieutenant started coughing . Gennady stopped . " In air this cold , I have found that wearing a mask helps , " he said . " It warms the air somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Comrade Lieutenant . If you take your security provisionsso seriously , you and your men should be in proper physical shape . I promise you that the Afghans are . Two winters ago I spent time with a Spetznaz team that chased them over a half dozen miserablemountains . We never did catch them . " But they caught us , he did n't say . Bondarenko would never forget that ambush .. . " Helicopters ? " 74  --  TOM CLANCY " They can not always fly in bad weather , my young Comrade , and in my case we were trying to establish that we , too , could fight in the mountains . " " Well , we have patrols out every day , of course . " It was the way he said it that bothered Bondarenko , and the Colonel made a mental note to check that out . " I low fir I1JVC we run ?

The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and its light marched down the nearer slopes , chasing the shadows into the deep , glacial valleys .

They did n't use searchlightsout of consideration for the civilians who lived here , but nightvisiondevices were a better choice in any case , and he was sure that the KGB troops used those . And  --  he shrugged  --  site security was n't the reason he 'd been sent down , though it was a fine excuse to needle the KGB security detail . " May I ask how you obtained your exercise clothing ? " the KGB officer asked when he was able to breathe properly . " Are you a married man , Comrade Lieutenant ? " " Yes , I am , Comrade Coolonel.

He went inside and took the ( lc% at ( r up Not surprisingly , there was no hot water for hisshower this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , chasingaway the last vestiges of sleep , shaved and dressed before walking over to the canteen for breakfast . He did n't have to be at the Ministry until nine , and on the way was a steam bath . One of the things Filitov had learned over the years was that nothing could chase away a hangover and clear your head like steam . He 'd had enough practice . His sergeant drove him to the Sandunovski Baths on Kuznetskiy Most , six blocks from the Kremlin . It was his usual Wednesday morning stop in any case . He was not alone , even this early . A handful of other probably important people trudged up the wide marble steps to the second floor 's firstclass ( not called that now , of course ) facilities , since thousands of Moscovites shared with the Colonel both his disease and its cure . Some of them were women , and Misha wondered if the female facilities were very different from those he was about to use . It was strange . He 'd been coming here since he joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gotten a peek into the women 's section . Well , I am too old for that now . His eyes were bloodshot and heavy as he undressed . Naked , he took a heavy bath towel from the pile at the end of the room , and a handful of birch branches . Filitov breathed the cool , dry air of the dressing room before opening the door that led to the steam rooms . The once-marble floor was largely replaced now with orange tiles . He could remember when the original floor had been nearly intact . Two men in their fifties were arguing about something , probably politics . He could hear their rasping voices above the hiss of steam coming off the hotbox that occupied the center of the room . Misha counted five other men , their heads stooped over , each of them enduring a hangover in grumpy solitude . He selected a seat in the front row , and sat . " Good morning , Comrade Colonel , " a voice said from five meters away . " And to you , Comrade Academician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wrapped tightly around his bundle of branches while he waited for the sweat to begin . It did n't take long  --  the room temperature was nearly one hundred forty degrees Fahrenheit . He breathed carefully , as the experienced ones did . The aspirins he 'd taken with his morning tea were beginning to work , though his head76  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  77was still heavy and the sinuses around his eves swollen . I le swatted the branches across his back , as though to exorcize the poisons from his body . " And how is the Hero of Stalingrad this morning ? " the academic persisted . " About as well as the genius of the Ministry of Education . " This drew a painful laugh . Misha never could remember his name ... Ilya Vladimirovich Somethingorother . What sort of firol could laugh during a hangover ? The man drank because of his wife , he said . You drink to be free of her , do you ? You boast of the times ' you 've fucked your secretary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Elena 's face . And my sons ' faces , he told himself . My two handsome sons . It was well to remember these things on such mornings . " Yesterday 's Pravda spoke of the arms negotiations , " the man persisted . " Is there hope for progress ? " " I have no idea , " Misha replied . An attendant came in . A young man , perhaps twenty-five or so and short . He counted heads in the room . " Does anyone wish a drink ? " he asked . Drinking was absolutely forbidden in the baths , but as any true Russian would say , that merely made the vodka taste better . " No ! " came the reply in chorus . No one was the least interested in the hair of the dog this morning , Misha noted with mild surprise . Well , it was the middle of the week . On a Saturday morning it would he very different . " Very well , " the attendant said on the way out the door . " There will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been repaired . Swinllning is . user fine ezeR1Se , ( . o111radCS .

" A more terrible thing not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said automatically , and wondered why . Heads came up and saw the burn scars on his back and chest . Even those who did not know who Mikhail Semyonovich Filitov was knew that this was not a man to be trifled with . He sat quietly for another ten minutes before leaving . The attendant was outside the door when he emerged . The Colonel handed over his branches and towel , then walked off to the coldwatershowers . Ten minutes later he was a new man , the pain and depression of the vodka gone , and the strain behind him . He dressed quickly and walked downstairs to where his car was waiting . His sergeant noted the change in his stride and wondered what was so curative about roasting yourself like a piece of meat . The attendant had his own task . On asking again a few minutes later , it turned out that two people in the steam room had changed their minds . He trotted out the building 's back door to a small shop whose manager made more money selling drink " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The attendant returned with a half-liter bottle of " Vodka "  --  it had no brand name as such ; the premium Stolychnayawas made for export and the elite  --  at a little over double the market price . The imposition of sales restrictions on alcohol had begun a whole new  --  and extremely profitable  --  part of the city 's black market . The attendant had also passed along a small film cassette that his contact had handed over with the birch branches . For his part , the bath attendant was also relieved . This was his only contact . He did n't know the man 's name , and had spoken the code phrase with the natural fear that this part of the CIA 's Moscow network had long since been compromised by the KGB 's counterintelligence department , the dreaded Second Chief Directorate . His life was alreadyforfeit and he knew it . But he had to do something . Ever since his year in Afghanistan , the things he 'd seen , and the things he 'd been forced to do . He wondered briefly who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man 's nature and identity were not his concern . The dry-cleaning shop catered mainly to foreigners , providing service to reporters , businessmen , and a few diplomats , along with the odd Russian who wished to protect clothing purchased abroad. 78  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  79One of these picked up an English overcoat , paid the three rubles , and left . She walked two blocks to the nearest Metro station , taking the escalator down to catch her train on the **32;16166;TOOLONG , the one marked in purple on the city maps . The train was crowded , and no one could have seen her pass the cassette . In fact , she herself did n't see the face of the man . Ile in turn made his way off the train at the next station , t'ushkinskava , and crossed over to Gor'kovskava Station . One more transfer was made ten minutes later , this one to an American who was on his way to the embassy a little late this morning , having staved long at a diplomatic reception the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the press attache at the embassy on Ulitsa Chaykovskogo . He and his wife , Mary Pat , another CIA agent , had been in Moscow for nearly four years , and both were looking forward to putting this grim , gray town behind them once and for all . They had two children , both of whom had been denied hot dogs and ball games long enough . It was n't that their tour of duty had n't been successful . The Russiansknew that CIA had a number of husband-wife teams in the field , but the idea that spies would take their children abroad was n't something that the Soviets could accept easily . There was also the matter of their cover . Ed Foley had been a reporter with the New York Times before joining the State Department  --  because , as he explained it , the money was n't much different and a police reporter never traveled farther than Attica . I is wife staved home with the children tier the most part though she did substitute-teach when needed at the Anglo American School at 78 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' heir older son played on a junior hockey team , and the h ( tli otlkers Who trailed them around had itritten tip III then the that i'dv. and Foley II was a pretty good wint ; nt.ut hi ! . t NC en vent ( dd .

I'ttle Walked the last ti  --  w blocks from the Metro station . He noddedI. ltel. to the militiaman who guarded the door to the grimlydecorous building , then to the Marine sergeant inside before going to his office . It was n't much . The embassy was officially described in the State Department 's USSR Post Report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same writer might call the burned-out shell of a South Bronx tenement a " fixer-upper , " Foley thought . In the building'slast renovation , his office had been remade from a storage room and broom closet into a marginally serviceable cubicle about ten feet square . The broom closet , however , was his private darkroom , and that was why the CIA station had had one of its people in this particular room for over twenty years , though Foley was the first station chief to be housed there . Only thirty-three , tall but very thin , Foley was an Irishman from Queens whose intellect was mated to an impossibly slow heart rate and a pokerface that had helped him earn his way through Holy Cross . Recruited by CIA in his senior year , he 'd spent four years with the Times to establish his own personal " legend . " He was remembered in the city room as an adequate , if rather lazy reporter who turned out workmanlike copy but never would really go anywhere . His editor had n't minded losing him to government service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Columbia 's School of Journalism with hustle and a real nose for what was happening . The current Times correspondent in Moscow had described him to his own colleagues and contacts as a nebbish , and rather a dull one at that , and in doing so gave Foley the most sought-after compliment in the business of espionage : Him ? He 's not smart enough to be a spy . For this and several other reasons , Foley was entrusted with running the Agency 's longest-lived , most productive agent-inplace , Colonel Mikhail Semyonovich Filitov , code name CARDINAL . The name itself , of course , was sufficiently secret that only five people within the Agency knew that it meant more than a red-caped churchman with princely diplomatic rank . Raw CARDINAL information was classified Special Intelligence/ Eyes Only-A , and there were only six A-cleared officials in the entire American government . Every month the code word for the data itself was changed . This month 's name was SATIN , for which less than twenty others were cleared . Even under that title , the data was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foley took the film cassette from his pocket and locked himself inthe darkroom . He could go through the developing process drunk and half-asleep . In fact , a few times , he had . Within six minutes , the job was done , and Foley cleaned up after himself . His former editor in New York would have found his neatness in Moscow surprising . Foley followed procedures that had been unchanged for nearly thirty years . He reviewed the six exposed frames through a magnifyingglass of the type used to inspect 35mm slides . He memorized each frame in a few seconds , and began typing a translation on his personal portable typewriter . It was a manual whose well-worn cloth ribbon was too frayed to be of use to anyone , particularly the KGB . Like many reporters , Foley was not a good typist . His pages bore strikeovers and X-outs . The paper was chemically treated , and you could n't use an eraser on it . It took nearly two hours for him to finish the transcription . When done , he made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't left anything out , nor made any serious grammatical mistakes . Satisfied , but with a tremor that he never quite got over , he crumpled the film into a ball and set it in a metal ashtray , where a wooden kitchen match reduced the only direct evidence of CARDINAL 's existence to ashes . He then smoked a cigar to disguise the distinctive smell of burning celluloid . The folded typescript pages went into his pocket , and Foley walked upstairs to the embassy 's communications room . Here he drafted an innocuous dispatch to Box 4108 , State Department , Washington : " Reference your 29 December . Expense report en route via pouch . Folev . Ends . " As press attache , 1 ) Iev had to pick up a lot of bar hills tirr tirrmer colleagues who held him in contempt that he did n't bother returning ; he had to do quite a fesv expense report firr the cookie-pushers at Foggy Bottom , and it . unused him greath that his press brethren worked so hard at nt.unt.nning his cover tirr him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though little known , this was one aspect of life at the Moscow post that had n't hanged sink e the 1930s .

A retired Army warrant officer , he had a I D.tiC and tiur Purple Hearts for flying casualties out of Vietnam battlefields . When he smiled at people , he did so in the Russian way , with the mouth but almost never the eves. " f  --  eel like flying home tonight ? " The man 's eyes lit up . " With the Super Bowl this Sunday ? You 're kidding . Stop by your office around four ? " " Right . " Foley closed the door and returned to his office . The courier booked himself on the British Airways 5:40 P.M. flight to Heathrow . The difference in time zones between Washington and Moscow virtually guaranteed that Foley 's messages reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA employee walked into the State Department mail room and extracted the message forms from a dozen or so boxes , then resumed his drive to Langley . A senior field officer in the OperationsDirectorate , he was barred from any further overseas duty due to an injury sustained in Budapest  --  where a street hoodlum had fractured his skull , and been locked up for five years by the irate local police . If only they 'd known , the agent thought , they 'd have given him a medal . He delivered the messages to the appropriate offices , and went to his own office . The message form was lying on Bob Ritter 's desk when he got to work at 7:25 . Ritter was the Agency 's Deputy Director for Operations . His turf , technically known as the Directorate of Operations , included all of the CIA 's field officers and all of the foreign citizens they recruited and employed as agents . The message from Moscowasusual there was more than one , but this one counted the mostwasimmediately tucked into his personal file cabinet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every day by the night-watch officers . " It 's open . " Back in Moscow , Foley looked up when the knock came at the door . The courier stepped in . " The plane leaves in an hour . I have to hustle . " Foley reached into his desk and pulled out what looked like an expensive silver cigarette case . He handed it over , and the courier handled it carefully before tucking it into his breast pocket . The typed pages were folded inside , along with a tiny pyrotechnic charge . If the case were improperly opened , or subjected to a sudden acceleration  --  likebeing dropped to a hard floor  --  the charge would go off and destroy the flash paper inside . It might also set fire to the courier 's suit , which explained his care in handling it. 82  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  83 " I should be back Tuesday morning .

" One of the embassy 's drivers took Augie Giannini to Sheremetyevo Airport , nineteen miles outside of Moscow , where the courier 's diplomaticpassport enabled him to walk past the security checkpoints and right onto the British Airways plane bound for Heathrow Airport . He rode in the coach section , on the right side of the aircraft . The diplomatic pouch had the window seat , with Giannini in the middle . Flights out of Moscow were rarely crowded , and the seat on his left was also vacant . The Boeing started rolling on schedule . The Captain announced the time of flight and destination , and the airliner started moving down the runway . The moment it lifted off Soviet soil , as often happened , the hundred and fifty passengers applauded . It was something that always amused the courier . Giannini pulled a paperback from his pocket and started reading . He could n't drink on the flight , of course , nor sleep , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The stewardess did manage to get a cup of coffee into him , however . Three hours later , the 747 thumped down at Heathrow . Again he was able to clear customs perfunctorily .

He never bothered himself wondering what he carried in the diplomatic bag , or in this metal case in his coat . He figured it was all a waste of time anyway . The world did n't change very much . " Got the case ? " the man in the back asked . " Yeah . " Giannini took it from his inside pocket and handed it back , with both hands . The CIA officer in the back took it , using both hands , and tucked it inside a foam-lined box . The officer was an instructor in the CIA 's Office of Technical Services , part of the Directorate of Science and Technology . It was an office that covered a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on booby traps and explosive devices in general . At Langley , he took the elevator to Ritter 's office and opened the cigarette case on the latter 's desk , then returned to his own office without looking at the contents . Ritter walked to his personal Xerox machine and made several copies of the flash-paper pages , which were then burned . It was not so much a security measure as a simple safety precaution . Ritter did n't want a sheaf of highly flammable material in his personal office . He started reading the pages even before all the copies were done . As usual , his head started moving left and right by the end of the first paragraph . The Deputy Director for Operations walked to his desk and punched the line to the Director 's office . " You busy ? The bird landed . " " Come on over , " Judge Arthur Moore replied at once . Nothing was more important than data from CARDINAL . Ritter collected Admiral Greer on the way , and the two of them joined the Director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta love this guy , " Ritter said as he handed the papers out .

Naturally , he detailed Misha to play gofer , so the report goes across his desk first . " " That kid Ryan met  --  Gregory , I think  --  wanted us to get a man into Dushanbe , " Greer noted with a chuckle . " Ryan told him it was impossible . " " Good , " Ritter observed . " Everybody knows what screw-ups the Operations Directorate is . " The entire CIA took perverse pride in the fact that only its failure made the news .

" " He 's a very careful man , boss , " Ritter pointed out . " Yeah , I know . " The DCI looked down at the pages . Since the death of Dmitri Fedorovich , it is not the same at the Defense Ministry , the DCI read . Sometimes I wonder if Marshal Yazov takes these new technological developments seriously enough , but to whom can I report my misgivings ? Would KGB believe me ? I must order my thoughts .

" So , it looks like they made a breakthrough on laser power output , " Ritter said . " Throughput ' is the current term , " Greer corrected . " At least that 's what Jack tells me . This is not very good news , gentlemen . " " Your usual keen eye for detail , James , " Ritter said . " God , what if they get there first ? " " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll take ten years to deploy the system even after the concept is validated , and they have n't come close to doing that yet , " the DCI pointed out . " The sky is not falling . This could even work to our benefit , could n't it , James ? " " If Misha can get us a usable description of their breakthrough , yes . In most areas we 're further along than they are , " the DDI replied . " Ryan will need this for his report . " " He 's not cleared for this ! " Ritter objected . " He had a look at Delta information before , " Greer noted . " Once . Only once , and there was a good reason for it  --  and , yes , he did damned well for an amateur .

" " Makes sense to me . " The Judge nodded . Greer conceded the point without argument . There was the temptation to voice the opinion that this was CARDINAL'smost important mission , but that would have been too dramatic for any of the three senior executives , and besides , CARDINALhad provided CIA with a good deal of important data over the years . Judge Moore reread the report after the others had left . Foley had tagged onto the end that Ryan had literally bumped into CARDINAL after Mary Pat had given him the new assignmentandright in front of Marshal Yazov . Judge Moore shook his head . What a pair , the Foleys . And how remarkable that Ryan had , after a fashion , made contact with Colonel Filitov . Moore shook his head . It was a crazy world. 4 .

" What about specific technical infirrntation ? " " I 'll let ' ( ) 11 know when it Lollies in , " Greer replied . " I WI IW() weeks I() delis Cr , h4Iss , " Ryan pointed out .

That was quite a bit of additional weight on his shoulders , but as Greer liked to tell him , Ryan did his best work under pressure . Jack wondered if maybe he should screw one up sometime , just to disprove that idea . " When will I have to go over ? " " I have n't decided yet . " " Can I have a couple of days ' warning ? " " We 'll see . " Major Gregory was actually at home . This was fairly unusual ; even more so , he was taking the day off . But that was n't his doing . His General had decided that all work and no play were beginning to take their toll on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gregory could work at home as well . " Do n't you ever stop ? " Candi asked . " Well , what are we supposed to do in between ? " He smiled up from the keyboard . The housing development was called Mountain View . It was n't a rousing bit of originality . In that part of the country the only way not to see mountains was to close your eyes . Gregory had his own personal computer  --  a very powerful Hewlett-Packard provided by the Project  --  and occasionally wrote some of his " code " there . He had to be careful about the security classification of his work , of course , though he often joked that he himself was n't cleared for what he was doing . That was not an unknown situation inside government . Dr. Candace Long was taller than her fiance at nearly five-ten , willowy , with short , dark hair . Her teeth were a little crooked because she 'd never wanted to suffer through braces , and her glasses were even thicker than Alan 's . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her work that she often forgot to eat . They 'd first met at a seminar for doctoral candidates at Columbia University . She was an expert in optical physics , specifically in adaptive-optics mirrors , a field she 'd selected to complement her life-long hobby , astronomy . Living in the New Mexico highlands , she was able to do her own observations on a $5,000 Meade telescope , and , on occasion , to use the instruments at the Project to probe the heavens  --  because , she pointed out , it was the only effective way to calibrate them . She had88  --  TOM CLANCY little real interest in Alan 's obsession with ballistic-missile defense , but she was certain that the instruments the ' were developing had all kinds of " real " applications in her field of interest . Neither of them was wearing very much at the moment . Both young people cheerfully characterized themselves as nerds , and as is often the case , they had awakened feelings in one another  --  feelings that their more attractive college kllows would have not thought possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's the misses we had . I think the problem 's in the mirror-control code . " " Oh ? " It was her mirror . " You 're sure it 's software ? " " Yeah . " Alan nodded . " I have the readouts from the Flying Cloud at the office . It was focusing just fine , but it was focusing on the wrong place . " " How long to find it ? " " Couple of weeks . " He frowned at the screen , then shut it down . " The hell with it . If the General finds out that I 'm doing this , he might never let me back in the door . " " I keep telling you . " She wrapped her hands around the back of his neck . He leaned back , resting his head between her breasts . They were rather nice ones , he thought . For Alan Gregory it had been a remarkable discovery , how nice girls were . He 'd dated occasionally in high school , but for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stony Brook , had been a monastic existence , devoted to studies and models and laboratories . When he 'd met Candi , his initial interest had been in her ideas fibr configuring mirrors , but over coffee at the Student Union , he 'd noticed in a rather clinical way that she was , well , attractive  --  in addition to being pretty swift with optical phys- ics . The fact that the things they frequently discussed in bed could be understood by less than one percent of the country 's population was irrelevant . They found it as interesting as the things that they did in bed  --  or almost so . There was a lot of experimentation to do there , too , and like good scientists , they 'd purchased textbooks  --  that 's how they thought of them  --  to explore all the possibilities . Like any new field of study , they found it exciting . Gregory reached up to grasp Dr. Long 's head , and pulled her face down to his . " I do n't feel like working anymore for a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day off ? " " Maybe I can arrange one for next week ... " Boris Filipovich Morozov got off the bus an hour after sunset . He and fourteen other young engineers and technicians recently assigned to Bright Star  --  though he did n't even know the project name yet  --  had been met at the Dushanbe airport by KGB personnel who 'd scrupulously checked their identity papers and photographs , and on the bus ride a KGB captain had given them a security lecture serious enough to get anyone 's attention . They could not discuss their work with anyone outside their station ; they could not write about what they did , and could not tell anyone where they were . Their mailing address was a post-office box in Novosibiirsk  --  over a thousand miles away . The Captain did n't have to say that their mail would be read by the base security officers . Morozov made a mental note not to seal his envelopes . His family might be worried if they saw that his letters were being opened and resealed . Besides , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had taken a mere four months . The KGB officers in Moscow who 'd done the background check had found his background beyond reproach , and even the six interviews that he 'd gone through had ended on a friendly note . The KGB Captain finished his lecture on a lighter note as well , describing the social and sport activities at the base , and the time and place for the biweekly Party meetings , which Morozov had every intention of attending as regularly as his work allowed . Housing , the Captain went on , was still a problem . Morozov and the other new arrivals would be placed in the dormitory-the original barracks put up by the construction gangs who 'd blasted the installation into the living rock . They would not be crowded , he said , and the barracks had a game room , library , and even a telescope on the roof for astronomical observation ; a small astronomy club had just formed . There was hourly bus service to the main residential facility , where there was a cinema , coffee shop , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the base , the Captain concluded , but one of them was engaged to him , " and any one of you who trifles with her will be shot ! " That drew laughter . It was n't very often that you met a KGB officer with a sense of humor . It was dark when the bus pulled through the gate into the facility , 90  --  TOM CLANCYand everyone aboard was tired . Morozov was not terribly disappointedat the housing . All the beds were two-level bunks . He was assigned the top berth in a corner . Signs on the wall demanded silence in the sleeping area , since the workers here worked three shifts around the clock . The young engineer was perfectly content to change his clothes and go to sleep . He was assigned to the Directional ApplicationsSection for a month of project orientation , after which he 'd receive a permanent job assignment . He was wondering what " directionalapplications " meant when he drifted off to sleep . The nice thing about vans was that lots of people owned them , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack thought as the white one pulled into his carport . The driver was CIA , of course , as was the security man in the right seat . He dismounted and surveyed the area for a moment before pulling the side door open . It revealed a familiar face . " Hello , Marko , " Ryan said . " So , this is house of spy ! " Captain First Rank Marko AleksandrovichRamius , Soviet Navy ( retired ) , said boisterously . His English was better , but like many Russian emigres he often forgot to use articles in his speech . " No , house of helmsman ! " Jack smiled and shook his head . " Marko , we ca n't talk about that . " " Your family does not know ? " " Nobody knows . But you can relax . My family 's away . " " Understand . " Marko Ramius followed Jack into the house . On his passport , Social Security card , and Virginia driver 's license he was now known as Mark Ramsey . Yet another piece of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you wanted people to remember their n , une . Ile was , lat k saw , a little thinner now that he was eating a less start by diet . And tan . When they 'd first met , at the forward esk.rpe trunk of the missile submarine ReilOctober , Marko  --  Mark !  --  had worry the Nasty white skin of a submarine officer . Now he looked hke an ad for ( lub Mcd . " You seem tired , " " Mark Ramsey " observed . " Whey fly me around a lot . f low do you like the Bahamas ? " " iou see my tan , yes ? White sand , sun , warm every day . Like ' uba when I went there , but nicer people . " " Al1 ' l. ( : , right ? " Jack asked . " Yes , brit I can not discuss this , " Marko replied . Both men shared a h  --  ) k A l 1 F. ( ' Atlantic Underwater Test and Evaluation Center  --  wasthe Navy 's submarine test range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What happened there was classified , of course . The Navy was very protective of its submarine operations . So Marko was at work developing tactics for the Navy , doubtless playing the role of a Soviet commander in the war games , lecturing , teaching . Ramius had been known as " the Schoolmaster " in the Soviet Navy . The important things never change . " How do you like it ? " " Tell this to nobody , but they let me be captain of American submarine for a week  --  the real Captain he let me do everything , yes ? I kill carrier ! Yes ! I kill Forrestal . They would be proud of me at Red Banner Northern Fleet , yes ? " Jack laughed . " How 'd the Navy like that ? " " Captain of submarine and me get very drunk . Forrestal Captain angry , but  --  good sport , yes ? He join us next week and we discuss exercise . He learn something , so good for all of us . " Ramius paused . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe and I do n't get along very well . " " Because you are spy ? " Mark/Marko asked . " Personal reasons . Can I get you a drink ? " " Beer is good , " he replied . Ramius looked around while Jack went into the kitchen . The house 's cathedral ceiling towered fifteen feetfivemeters , he thought  --  above the lush carpeting . Everything about the house testified to the money spent to make it so . He was frowning when Ryan returned . " Ryan , I am not fool , " he said sternly . " CIA does not pay so good as this . " " Do you know about the stock market ? " Ryan asked with a chuckle . " Yes , some of my money is invested there . " All of the officers from Red October had enough money salted away that they 'd never need to work again . " Well , I made a lot of money there , and then I decided to quit and do something else . " That was a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is word ? Greed . You have no more greed ? " " How much money does one man need ? " Ryan asked rhetorically . The Captain nodded thoughtfully . " So , I have some questions for you . " " Ah , business . " Marko laughed . " This you have not forgotten ! " 92  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  93 " In your debriefing , you mentioned that you ran an exercise in which you fired a missile , and then a missile was fired at you . " " Yes , years ago  --  was 1981 ... April , yes , it was twenty April . I command Delta-class missile submarine , and we fire two rockets from White Sea , one into Okhotsk Sea , other at Sary Shagan . We test submarine rockets , of course , but also the missile defense radar and counterbattery system  --  they simulated tiring a missile at my sub-marine . " " You said it failed . " Marko nodded . " Submarine rockets fly perfectly . The Sary Shagan radar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem , they say . They say get new computer , last thing I hear . Third part of test almost work . " " The counterfire part . That 's the first we heard of it , " Ryan noted . " How did they actually run the test ? " " They not fire land rocket , of course , " Marko said . He held up a finger . " They do this , and you understand nature of test , yes ? Soviets are not so stupid as you think . Of course you know that entire Soviet border covered with radar fence . These see rocket launch and computewhere submarine is  --  very easy thing to do . Next they call Strategic Rocket Force Headquarters . Strategic Rocket Force have regiment of old rockets on alert for this . They were ready to shoot back three minutes after detecting my missile on radar . " He stopped for a moment . " You not have this in America ? " " No , not that I know of . But our new missiles fire from much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good thing for Soviets , you see . " " I Irnv rCli.tble is the system ?

Even one could say c hundred thousand citizens . This is important to Soviet leadership . Hundred thousand more slaves to have after war end , " he added to show his distaste for the government of his forme ! homeland . " You have nothing like this in America ? " " Not that I have ever heard about , " Ryan said truthfully . R.unitis shook his head . " They tell us you do . When we fire ourkets , then we dive deep and race at flank speed , straight line in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to figure out how interested the Soviet government is in copying our SDI research . " " Interested ? " Ramius snorted . " Twenty million Russians died in Great Patriotic War . You think they want to have this happen again ? I tell you , Soviets are more intelligent about this than Americans  --  we have harder lesson , and we learn better . Someday I tell you about my home city after war , destruction of everything . Yes , we have very good lesson in protect Rodina . " That 's the other thing to remember about the Russians , Jack reminded himself . It was n't so much that they had abnormally long memories ; they had things in their history that no one would forget . To expect the Soviets to forget their losses in the Second World War was as futile as asking Jews to forget the Holocaust , and just as unreasonable . So , a little over three years ago , the Russians staged a major ABM exercise against submarine-launched ballistic missiles . The acquisition and tracking radar worked , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important . But " The reason the computer did n't work well enough  --  " " That is all I know . All I can say is was honest test . " " What do you mean ? " Jack asked . " Our first . . . yes , our original orders were to fire from known location . But the orders were changed just as submarine left dock . Eyes-only to Captain , new orders signed by aide to Defense Minister . Was Red Army colonel , I think . Do not remember name . Orders from Minister , but Colonel sign them , yes ? He wanted the test to be  --  how you say ? " " Spontaneous ? " " Yes ! Not spontaneous . Real test should be surprise .

Very , very angry , but what kind of test is it without no surprise ? American missile submarines do not call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You either are ready or not ready , " Ramius noted . " We did not know that you were coming , " General Pokryshkin noted dryly . Colonel Bondarenko was careful to keep his face impassive . Despitehaving written orders from the Defense Minister , and despite belonging to a completely different uniformed service , he was dealing94  --  TOM CLANCY with a general officer with patrons of his own in the Central Corn- mittee . But the General , too , had to he wan ' . Bondarenko was wear- ing his newest and best-tailored uniform , complete with several rows of ribbons , including two awards fi ) r bravery in Afghanistan and the special badge worn by Defense Ministry staff officers . " Comrade General , I regret whatever inconvenience I have caused you , but I do have my orders . " " Of course , " Pokryshkin noted with a broadening smile . He ges- tured to a silver tray . " Tea ? " " Thank you . " The General poured two cups himself instead of summoning his orderly . " Is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , Comrade General , I spent some time there . " " And how did you earn it ? " " I was attached to a Spetznaz unit as a special observer . We were tracking a small band of bandits . Unfortunately , they were smarter than the unit commander believed , and he allowed us to follow them into an ambush . Half the team was killed or wounded , including the unit commander . " Who earned his death , Bondarenko thought . " I assumed command and called in help . The bandits withdrew before we could bring major forces to bear , but they did leave eight bodies behind . " " How did a communications expert  --  " " I volunteered . We were having difficulties with tactical corn- munications , and I decided to take the situation in hand myself . I any not a real combat soldier , Comrade General , but there are some things you have to see fitr yourself . That is another concern I have with this post . We are perilously close to the Afghan border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overly comfortable . " Polo vshkin nodded agreement . " The security force is KGB , as you h.tc doubtless noted . ' !

If anyone approaches this installation from Afghanistan , it 's a long walk , and we 'll know the gut it long lx  --  tore they get here . " Ronda ' enko noted this with approval . Procurer for wizards or not , Pi 1k0 yshknt had n't forgotten everything , as too many general ) fft , rts tended to do . " So , Gennady Iosifovich , exactly what are you looking for ? " the General asked . The atmosphere was somewhat milder now that both men had established their professionalism . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your systems . " " Your knowledge of lasers ? " Pokryshkin asked with a raised eyebrow . " I am familiar with the applications side . I was on the team with Academician Goremykin that developed the new laser communicationssystems . " " Really ? We have some of them here . " " I did n't know that , " Bondarenko said . " Yes . We use them in our guard towers , and to link our laboratory facilities with the shops . It 's easier than stringing telephone lines , and is more secure . Your invention has proven very useful indeed , Gennady Iosifovich . Well . You know our mission here , of course . " " Yes , Comrade General . How close are you to your goal ? " " We have a major system test coming up in three days . " " Oh ? " Bondarenko was very surprised by that . " We received permission to run it only yesterday . Perhaps the Ministry has n't been fully informed . Can you stay for it ? " " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pokryshkin rose . " Come , let 's go to see my wizards . " The sky was clear and blue , the deeper blue that comes from being above most of the atmosphere . Bondarenko was surprised to see that the General did his own driving in a UAZ-469 , the Soviet equivalent of a jeep . " You do not have to ask , Colonel . I do my own driving because we do not have room up here for unnecessary personnel , and  --  well , I was a fighter pilot . Why should I trust my life to some beardless boy who barely knows how to shift gears ? How do you like our roads ? " Not at all , Bondarenko did n't say as the General speeded down a slope . The road was barely five meters wide , with a precipitous drop on the passenger side of the car . " You should try this when it 's icy ! " The General laughed . " We 've been lucky on weather lately . Last autumn we had nothing but rain tier two weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop all the water on India , but the winter has been agreeably dry and96  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  97clear . " He shifted gears as the road bottomed out . A truck was coming from the other direction , and Bondarenko did all he could not to cringe as the jeep 's right-side tires spun through rocks at the road 's uneven edge . Pokrvshkin was having some fun with him , but that was to be expected . The truck swept past with perhaps a meter of clearance , and the General moved back to the center of the blacktoppedroad . He shifted gears again as they came to an upslope . " We do n't even have room tir a proper office here  --  for me at any rate , " Pokrvshkin noted . " The academicians have priority . " Bondarenko had seen only one of the guard towers that morning as he ran around the residential facility , and as the jeep climbed the last few meters , the Bright Star test area became visible . There were three security checkpoints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at each of them . " The guard towers ? " Bondarenko asked . " All manned round the clock . It is hard on the chekisti . I had to install electric heaters in the towers . " The General chuckled . " We have more electrical power here than we know how to use . We originally had guard dogs running between the fences , too , but we had to stop that . Two weeks ago several of them froze to death . I did n't think that would work . We still have a few , but they walk about with the guards . I 'd just as soon get rid of them . " " But  --  " " More mouths to feed , " Pokryshkin explained . " As soon as it snows , we have to bring food in by helicopter . To keep guard dogs happy , they must eat meat . Do you know what it does for camp morale to have dogs on a meat diet when our scientists do n't have enough ? Dogs are n't worth the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permission to dispense with them altogether . We have starlight-scopes in all the towers . We can see an intruder long before a dog would smell or hear one . " " How big is your guard force ? " " A reinforced rifle company . One hundred sixteen officers and men , commanded by a lieutenant colonel . There are at least twenty guards on duty round the clock . Half here , half on the other hill . Right here , two men in each of the towers at all times , plus four on roving patrol , and of course the people at the vehicle checkpoints . The area is secure , Colonel . A full rifle company with heavy weapons on top of this mountain  --  to be sure , we had a Spetznaz team runan assault exercise last October . The umpires ruled them all dead before they got to within four hundred meters of our perimeter . One of them almost was , as a matter of fact . One pink-faced lieutenant damned near fell off the mountain . " Pokryshkin turned . " Satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my overly cautious nature . " " You did n't get those pretty ribbons from being a coward , " the General observed lightly . " I am always open to new ideas . If you have something to say , my door is never locked . " Bondarenko decided that he was going to like General Pokryshkin . He was far enough from Moscow not to act like an officious ass , and unlike most generals , he evidently did n't see a halo in the mirror when he shaved . Perhaps there was hope for this installation after all . Filitov would be pleased . " It is like being a mouse , with a hawk in the sky , " Abdul observed . " Then do what a mouse does , " the Archer replied evenly . " Stay in the shadows . " He looked up to see the An-26 . It was five thousand meters overhead , and the whine of its turbine engines barely reached them . Too far for a missile , which was unfortunate . Other mudjaheddin missileers had shot the Antonovs down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many as forty Russians that way . And the Soviets were learning to use the converted transports for ground surveillance . That made life harder on the guerrillas . The two men were following a narrow path along the side of yet another mountain , and the sun had n't reached them yet , though most of the valley was fully lit under the cloudless winter sky . The bombed-out ruins of a village lay next to a modest river . Perhaps two hundred people had lived there once , until the high-altitude bombers came . He could see the craters , laid out in uneven lines two or three kilometers in length . The bombs had marched through the valley , and those who had not been killed were gone  --  to Pakistan  --  leaving only emptiness behind . No food to be shared with the freedomfighters , no hospitality , not even a mosque in which to pray . Part of the Archer still wondered why war had to be so cruel .

" Pretty deep , " he observed . " Yes , we have to determine how effective our vibration-isolation measures are . " The senior man was worried about that . He heard a jeep motor and turned to see the base commander lead another man into the laser building . Another visitor from Moscow , he judged . How do we ever get work done with all those Party hacks hanging over our shoulders ? " Have you met General Pokryshkin ? " he asked Morozov . " No . What sort of man is he ? " " I 've met worse . Like most people , he thinks the lasers are the important part . Lesson number one , Boris Filipovich : it 's the mirrors that are the important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless unless we can focus their energy on a specific point in space . " This lesson told Morozov which part of the project came under this man 's authority , but the newly certified engineer already knew the real lesson  --  the entire system had to work perfectly . One faulty segment would convert the most expensive piece of hardware in the Soviet Union into a collection of curious toys. 98 TOM CLANCY future he 'd once held , all of his firmer life slipped further away with the passage of every day . It seemed that he only thought of them when asleep now  --  and when he awoke , the dreams of a peaceful , contented life wafted away fi.cnn his grasp like the morning mist . But even those dreams were fading away . I le could still see his wife 's face , and his daughter 's , and his son 's , but they were like photographs now , flat , lifeless , cruel reminders of times that would not return . But at least they gave his life purpose . When he felt pity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approved of what he did  --  of the things that had sickened him at first  --  he could close his eyes for a moment and remind himself why the screams of dying Russians were as sweet to his cars as the passionate cries of his wife . " Going away , " Abdul noted . The Archer turned to look . The sun glinted off the plane 's vertical rudder as it passed beyond the far ridges . Even if he 'd been atop that rocky edge , the An-26 would have been too high . The Russians were n't fools . They flew no lower than they had to . If he really wanted to get one of those , he 'd have to get close to an airfield . . . or perhaps come up with a new tactic . That was a thought . The Archer started ordering the problem in his mind as he walked along the endless rocky path . " Will it work ? " Morozov asked .

Eye of the Snake/Face of the DragonTHE converted Boeing 767 had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was now called Cobra Belle , which at least sounded better . The aircraft was little more than a platform for as large an infrared telescope as could be made to fit in the wide-bodied airliner . The engineers had cheated somewhat , of course , giving the fuselage an ungainly humpback immediately aft of the flight deck that extended half its length , and the 767 did look rather like a snake that had just swallowed something large enough to choke on . What was even more remarkable about the aircraft , however , was the lettering on its vertical tail : u.s . ARMY . This fact , which infuriated the Air Force , resulted from unusual prescience or obstinacy on the part of the Army , which even in the 1970s had never shut down its research into ballistic-missile defense , and whose " hobby shop " ( as such places were known ) had invented the infrared sensors on the AOA . But it was now part of an Air Force program whose cover-all name was Cobra . It worked in coordination with the Cobra Dane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an aircraft called Cobra Ball  --  a converted 707  --  because Cobra was the code name for afamily of systems aimed at tracking Soviet missiles . The Army was smugly satisfied that the Air Force needed its help , though wary of ongoing attempts to steal its program . The flight crew went through its checklist casually , since they had plenty of time . They were from Boeing . So far the Army had successfullyresisted attempts by the Air Force to get its own people on the flight deck . The copilot , who was ex-Air Force , ran his finger down the paper list of things to do , calling them off in a voice neither excited nor bored while the pilot and flight engineer/navigator pushed the buttons , checked the gauges , and otherwise made their aircraft ready for a safe flight . The worst part of the mission was the weather on the ground . Shemya , one of the western Aleutians , is a small island , roughly four miles long by two wide , whose highest point is a mere two hundred thirty-eight feet above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aleutians would close most reputable airports , and what they called bad weather here made the Boeing crew wish for Amtrak . It was widely believed on the base that the only reason the Russians sent their ICBM tests to the Sea of Okhotsk was to make life as miserable as possible for the Americans who monitored them . Today the weather was fairly decent . You could see almost to the far end of the runway , where the blue lights were surrounded by little globes of mist . Like most flyers , the pilot preferred daylight , but in winter that was the exception here . He counted his blessings : there was supposed to be a ceiling at about fifteen hundred feet , and it was n't raining yet . The crosswinds were a problem , too , but the wind never blew where you wanted up here  --  or more correctly , the people who laid out the runway had n't known or cared that wind was a factor in flying airplanes . " Shemya Tower , this is Charlie Bravo , ready to taxi . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Winds are two-five-zero at fifteen . " The tower did n't have to say that Cobra Belle was number one in line . At the moment , the 767 was the only aircraft on the base . Supposedly in California for equipment tests , it had been rushed here only twenty hours earlier . " Roger . Charlie Bravo is rolling . " Ten minutes later the Boeing started down the runway , to begin what was expected to be yet another routine mission . Twenty minutes later the AOA reached its cruising altitude of102  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  10345,000 feet . The ride was the same smooth glide known by airline passengers , but instead of downing their first drinks and making their dinner selections , the people aboard this aircraft had already unbuckledand gone to work . There were instruments to activate , computers to recycle , data links to set up , and voice links to check out . The aircraft was equipped with every communications system known to man , and would have had a psychic aboard if that Defense Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as originally hoped . The man commandingit was an artilleryman with a masters in astronomy , of all things , from the University of Texas . His last command had been of a Patriot missile battery in Germany . While most men looked at airplanes and wished to fly them , his interest had always been in shooting them out of the sky . He felt the same way about ballistic missiles , and had helped develop the modification that enabled the Patriot missile to kill other missiles in addition to Soviet aircraft . It also gave him an intimate familiarity with the instruments used to track missiles in flight . The mission book in the Colonel 's hands was a facsimile printoutfrom the Washington headquarters of the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) telling him that in four hours and sixteen minutes the Soviets would conduct a test firing of the SS-25 ICBM . The book did n't say how DIA had obtained that information , though the Colonelknew that it was n't from reading an ad in Izrestia . Cobra Belle 's mission was to monitor the firing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , most important , to take pictures of the warheads in flight . The data collected would later he analyzed to determine the perfi ) rmance of the missile , and most particularly the accuracy of its warhead delivery , a matter of the greatest interest to Washington . As mission commander , the Colonel did n't have a great deal to do . His control board was a panel of colored lights that showed the status of various onboard systems . Since the AOA was a fairly new item in the inventory , everything aboard worked reasonably well . Today the only thing currently " down " was a backup data link , and a technician was working to put that back on line while the Colonel sipped his coffee . It was something of an effort for him to look interested while he had nothing in particular to do , but if he started looking bored , it would set a bad example for his people . He reachedin the zippered sleeve pocket of his flight suit for a butterscotch candy . These were healthier than the cigarettes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good for his teeth , the base dentist liked to point out . The Colonel sucked on the candy for five minutes before he decided that he had to do something . He unstrapped from his command chair and went to the flight deck forward . " ' Morning , people . " It was now 0004-Lima , or 12:04 A.M. , local time . " Good morning , Colonel , " the pilot replied for his crew . " Everythingworking in back , sir ? " " So far . How 's the weather in the patrol area ? " " Solid undercast at twelve-to-fifteen thousand , " the navigator answered , holding up a satellite photograph . " Winds three-two-five at thirty knots . Our nav systems check out with the track from Shemya , " she added . Ordinarily the 767 operates with a crew of two flight officers . Not this one . Since the Korean Air 007 flight had been shot down by the Soviets , every flight over the Western Pacific was especiallycareful with its navigation . This was doubly true of Cobra Belle ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within fifty miles of Soviet territory , nor into the Russian Air Defense Identification Zone , but twice the Soviets had sent fightersto let the AOA know they cared . " Well , we are n't supposed to get very close , " the Colonel observed . He leaned between the pilot and copilot to look out the windows . Both turbofans were performing well . He would have preferred a four-engined aircraft for extended over-water flight , but that had n't been his decision . The navigator raised an eyebrow at the Colonel 's interest and got a pat on the shoulder by way of apology . It was time to leave . " Time to observation area ? " " Three hours , seventeen minutes , sir ; three hours thirty-nine minutes to orbit point . " " Guess I have time for a nap , " the Colonel said on his way to the door . He closed it and walked aft , past the telescope assembly to the main cabin . Why was it that the crews doing the flying now were so damned young ? They probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Forward , the pilot and copilot shared a look . Old fart does n't trust us to fly the goddamned airplane , does he ? They adjusted themselves in104  --  TOM CLANCYtheir seats , letting their eyes scan for the blinking lights of other aircraft while the autopilot controlled the aircraft . Morozov was dressed like the other scientists in the control room , in a white laboratory coat adorned with a security pass . He was still going through orientation , and his assignment to the mirror-control team was probably temporary , though he was beginning to appreciate just how important this part of the program was . In Moscow , he 'd learned how lasers work , and done some impressive lab work with experimental models , but he 'd never truly appreciated the fact that when the energy came out the front of the instruments the task had only begun . Besides , Bright Star had already made its breakthrough in laser power . " Recycle , " the senior engineer said into his headset . They were testing the system calibration by tracking their mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which star . They picked one at random for each test . " Makes one hell of a telescope , does n't it ? " the engineer noted , looking at his TV screen . " You were concerned about the stability of the system . Why ? " " We require a very high degree of accuracy , as you might imagine . We 've never actually tested the complete system . We can track stars easily enough , but . . . " He shrugged . " This is still a young program , my friend . Just like you . " " Why do n't you use radar to select a satellite and track on that ? " " ' That 's a fine question ! " The older man chuckled . " I 've asked that myself . It has to do with arms-control agreements or some such nonsense . For the moment , they tell us , it is enough that they feed us coordinates of our targets via landline . We do not have to acquire them ourselves . Rubbish ! " he concluded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other side of the room , the laser-control team were shuffling about busily , with a flock of uniformed soldiers behind them whispering to themselves . Next he checked the clock  --  sixty-three minutes until the test began . One by one , the technicians were drifting off to the rest room . He did n't feel the need , nor did the section chief , who finally pronouncedhimself satisfied with his systems , and placed everything on standby . THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  105At 22,300 miles over the Indian Ocean , an American Defense Support Program satellite hung in geosynchronous orbit over a fixed point on the Indian Ocean . Its huge cassegrain-focus Schmidt telescopewas permanently aimed at the Soviet Union , and its mission was to provide first warning that Russian missiles had been launched at the United States . Its data was downlinked via Alice Springs , Australia , to various installations in the United States . Viewing conditionswere excellent at the moment . Almost the entire visible hemisphereof the earth was in darkness , and the cold , wintry ground easily showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitored the DSPS in Sunnyvale , California , routinely amused themselves by counting industrial facilities . There was the Lenin Steel Plant at Kazan , and there was the big refinery outside Moscow , and there " Heads up , " a sergeant announced . " We have an energy bloom at Plesetsk . Looks like one bird lifting off from the ICBM test fa-cility . " The Major who had the duty this night immediately got on the phone to " Crystal Palace , " the headquarters of the North American Aerospace Defense Command  --  NORAD  --  under Cheyenne Mountain , Colorado , to make sure that they were copying the satellite data . They were , of course . " That 's the missile launch they told us about , " he said to himself . As they watched , the bright image of the missile rocket exhaust started turning to an easterly heading as the ICBM arced over into the ballistic flight path that gave the missile its name . The Major had the characteristics of all Soviet missiles memorized . If this were an SS-25 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The screen bloomed bright before their eyes as a fireball six hundred yards in diameter appeared . The orbiting camera did the mechanical equivalent of a blink , altering its sensitivity after its sensors were dazzled by the sudden burst of heat energy . Three seconds later it was able to track on a cloud of heated fragments , curving down to earth . " Looks like that one blew , " the sergeant observed unnecessarily . " Back to the drawing board , Ivan ... " " Still have n't licked the second-stage problem , " the Major added . He wondered briefly what the problem was , but did n't care all that much . The Soviets had rushed the - 25 into production and had106  --  TOM CLANCYalready begun deploying them on railcars for mobility , but they were still having problems with the solid-fuel bird . The Major was glad for it . It did n't take a great degree of unreliability in missiles to make their use a very chancy thing . And that uncertainty was still the best guarantee of peace . " Crystal Palace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after launch . Is Cobra Belle up to monitor the test ? " " That 's affirmative , " the officer on the other end replied . " We 'll call them off . " " Right . ' Night , Jeff . " Aboard Cobra Belle , ten minutes later , the mission commander acknowledged the message and cut off the radio channel . He checked his watch and sighed . He did n't feel like heading back to Shemya yet . The Captain in charge of the mission hardware suggested that they could always use the time to calibrate their instruments . The Colonel thought about that one and nodded approval . The aircraft and crew were new enough that everyone needed the practice . The camera system was put in the MTI-mode . A computer that registered all the energy sources the telescope found began to search only for targets that were moving . The technicians on the screens watched as the Moving-Target Indicator rapidly eliminated the stars and began to find a few low-altitude satellites and fragments of orbiting space junk . The camera system was sensitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a range of one thousand miles , and soon they had their choice of targets . The camera locked on them one by one and made its photographic images in digital code on computer tape . Though mainly a practice drill , this data would automatically be forwarded to NORAI ) , where it would update the register of informationof orbiting objects . " The power-output breakthrough you 've made is breathtaking , " Colonel Bondarenko said quietly . " Yes , " General Pokryshkin agreed . " Amazing how that happens , is n't it ? One of my wizards notices something and tells another , who tells another , and the third says something that works its way back to the first , and so on . We have the best minds in the country here , and still the discovery process seems about as scientific as stubbing your toe on a chair ! That 's the odd part . But that 's what makes it soTHE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  107exciting . Gennady Iosifovich , this is the most exciting thing I 've done since I won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After thirty years of work , we may have discovered the basis of a system to protect the Rodina against enemy missiles . " Bondarenko thought that was an overstatement , but the test would demonstrate just how much of an overstatement . Pokryshkin was the perfect man for this job , however . The former fighter pilot was a genius at directing the efforts of the scientists and engineers , many of whom had egos as large as a battle tank , though far more fragile . When he had to bully , he bullied . When he had to cajole , he cajoled . He was by turns the father , uncle , and brother to all of them . It took a man with a large Russian heart to do that . The Colonel guessed that commanding fighter pilots had been good training for this task , and Pokryshkin must have been a brilliant regimental commander . The balance between pressure and encouragement was so hard to strike , but this man managed it as easily as breathing . Bondarenko was watching how he did it very closely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own career . The control room was separate from the laser building itself , and too small for the men and equipment it held . There were over a hundred engineers  --  sixty doctorates in physics  --  and even those called technicians could have taught the sciences at any university in the Soviet Union . They sat or hovered at their consoles . Most smoked , and the air-conditioning system needed to cool the computers struggledmightily to keep the air clear . Everywhere were digital counters . Most showed the time : Greenwich Mean Time , by which the satellites were tracked ; local time ; and , of course , Moscow Standard Time . Other counters showed the precise coordinates of the target satellite , Cosmos-1810 , which bore the international satellite designator 1986-102A . It had been launched from the Cosmodrome at Tyuratam on December 26 , 1986 , and was still up because it had failed to deorbit with its film . Telemetry showed that its electrical systems were still functioning , though its orbit was slowly decaying , with a current perigee  --  the lowest point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was now approaching perigee , directly over Bright Star . " Powering up ! " the chief engineer called over the intercom headsets . " Final system check . " " Tracking cameras on line , " one technician reported . The wall speakers filled the room with his voice . " Cryogen flows nominal . " 108  --  TOM CLANCY " Mirror tracking controls in automatic mode , " reported the engineersitting next to Morozov . The young engineer was on the edge of his swivel chair , eyes locked to a television screen that was as yet blank . " Computer sequencing in automatic , " a third said . Bondarenko sipped at his tea , trying and failing to calm himself . He 'd always wanted to be present for a space rocket launch , but never been able to arrange it . This was the same sort of thing . The excitement was overpowering . All around him machines and men were uniting into a single entity to make something happen as one after another announced the readiness of himself and his equipment . Fi-nally : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are ready to shoot , " the chief engineer concluded the litany . All eyes turned to the right side of the building , where the team on the tracking cameras had their instruments trained on a section of the horizon to the northwest . A white dot appeared , coming upward into the black dome of the night sky .. . " Target acquisition ! " Next to Morozov , the engineer lifted his hands from the control panel to ensure that he would n't inadvertently touch a button . The " automatic " light was blinking on and off . Two hundred meters away , the six mirrors arrayed around the laser building twisted and turned together , coming almost vertical with the ground as they tracked after a target sitting above the jagged , mountainous horizon . On the next knoll over , the tour mirrors of the imaging array did the same . Outside , alarm klaxons sounded , and rotating hazard lights warned everyone in the open to turn away from the laser building . On the TV screen next to the chief engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance against mistakes , he and three others had to make positive ' visual identification of their target . " That one 's Cosmos-1810 , " the Captain was telling the Colonel aboard Cobra Belle . " Broken recon bird . Must have had a reentrymotorfailure  --  it did n't come back down when they told it to . It 's in degenerating orbit , should have about four more months left . The satellite 's still sending routine telemetry data out . Nothing imTHECARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  109portant , far as we can tell , just telling Ivan that it 's still up there . " " The solar panels must still be working , " the Colonel observed . The heat came from internal power . " Yeah . I wonder why they did n't just turn it off . . . Anyway , the onboard temperature reads out at , oh , fifteen degrees Celsius or so . Nice cold background to read it against . In sunlight we might not have been able to pick out the difference between onboard and solar heating ... " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement was discernible on the six television screens that monitoredthem . A low-power laser reflected off one mirror , reaching out to find the target . . . In addition to aiming the whole system , it made a high-resolution image on the command console . The identity of the target was now confirmed . The chief engineer turned the key that " enabled " the entire system . Bright Star was now fully out of human hands , controlled wholly by the site 's main computer complex . " There 's target lock , " Morozov observed to his senior . The engineer nodded agreement . His range readout was rapidly dropping as the satellite came toward them , circling its way to destructionat 18,000 miles per hour . The image they had was of a slightly oblong blob , white with internal heat against a sky devoid of warmth . It was exactly in the center of the targeting reticle , like a white oval in a gunsight . They did n't hear anything , of course . The laser building was fully insulated against temperature and sound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , watching the television screens in the controlbuilding , a hundred men balled hands into fists at the same instant . " What the hell ! " the Captain exclaimed . The image of Cosmos-1810 suddenly went as bright as the sun . The computer instantly adjusted its sensitivity , but for several seconds failed to keep pace with the change in the target 's temperature . " What in hell hit . . . Sir , that ca n't be internal heat . " The Captain punched up a command on his keyboard and got a digital readout of the satellite 's apparent temperature . Infrared radiation is a fourthpowerfunction . The heat given off by an object is the square of the110  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  111square of its temperature . " Sir , the target temperature went from fifteen-C to ... looks like eighteen hundred-C in under two seconds . Still climbing . . . wait , it 's dropping  --  no , it 's climbing again . Rate of rise is irregular , almost like . . . Now it 's dropping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his left , the Colonel started punching buttons on his communicationsconsole , activating an encrypted satellite link to CheyenneMountain . When he spoke , it was in the matter-of-fact tone that professional soldiers save for only the worst nightmares . The Colonel knew exactly what he 'd just seen . " Crystal Palace , this is Cobra Belle . Stand by to copy a Superflash message . " " Standing by . " " We have a high-energy event . I say again , we are tracking a highenergyevent . Cobra Belle declares a Dropshot . Acknowledge . " He turned to the Captain , and his face was pale . At NORAD headquarters , the senior watch officer had quickly to check his memory to remember what a Dropshot was . Two seconds later , a " Jesus " was spoken into his headset . Then : " Cobra Belle , we acknowledge your last . We acknowledge your Dropshot . Stand by while we get moving here . Jesus , " he said again , and turned to his deputy . " Transmit a Dropshot Alert to the NMCC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Find Colonel Welch and get him in here . " The watch officer next lifted a phone and punched the code for his ultimate boss , Commander in Chief of North American Aerospace Defense Command , CI NC-NORAD . " Yes , " a gruff r ( icc said over the phone . " General , this is Colonel I lenriksen . Cobra Belle has declared a I ) opshot Alert . l hev sad they have just seen a high-energy event .

" " Very well , ( * , lonel . I 'm on the way . Get a bird up to Shemya to fiv that Army guy down . " l hr ( *I*ncl alkrard Cobra Belle was now talking to his coinnnrnr ( at a ms officer , ordering him to send everything they had viadigital link @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . Next the mission commander told the flight crew to return to Shemya . They still had enough fuel for two more hours of patrolling , but he figured that nothing else would be happening tonight . What had taken place to this point was enough . The colonel had just had the privilege of witnessing something that few men in human history ever saw . He had just seen the world change , and unlike most men , he understood the significance of it . It was an honor , he told himself , that he would just as soon have never seen . " Captain , they got there first . " Dear God . Jack Ryan was just about to take the cloverleaf exit off I-495 when his car phone rang . " Yes ? " " We need you back here . " " Right . " The line clicked off . Jack took the exit and stayed in the curb lane , continuing to take another of the sweeping cloverleaf exits back onto the Washington Beltway , and back to CIA . It never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the SEC people . It had turned out that the company officers had been cleared of any wrongdoing , and that cleared him , too  --  or would , if the SEC investigators ever closed their file . He 'd hoped to call it a day and drive home . Ryan grumbled as he headed back toward Virginia , wondering what today 's crisis was . Major Gregory and three members of his software team were all standing by a blackboard , diagramming the flow of their mirrorcontrolprogram package when a sergeant entered the room . " Major , you 're wanted on the phone . " " I 'm busy ; can it wait ? " " It 's General Parks , sir . " " His master 's voice , " Al Gregory grumbled . He tossed the chalk to the nearest man and walked out of the room . He was on the phone in a minute . " There 's a helicopter on its way to pick you up , " the General said without any pleasantries . " Sir , we 're trying to nail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you at Kirtland . Not enough time112  --  TOM CLANCY to get you here on a commercial bird . You wo n't need to pack . Get moving , Major ! " " Yessir . " " What went wrong ? " Morozov asked . The engineer stared at his console , an angry frown on his face . " Thermal blooming . Damn ! I thought we 'd put that one behind us . " Across the room , the low-powered laser system was making an- other image of the target . The monocolor image was like a close-up black-and-white photograph , though what would have been black was maroon instead . The television technicians made up a split-screen image to compare before and after . " No holes , " Pokryshkin noted sourly . " So what ? " Bondarenko said in surprise . " My God , man , you melted the thing ! That looks like it was dipped in a ladle of molten steel . " And indeed it did . What had been flat surfaces were now rippled from the intense heat that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body of the satellite  --  which were designed to absorb light energy  --  appeared to be burned off entirely . On closer inspection , the entire satellite body was distorted from the energy that had blasted it . Pokryshkin nodded , but his expression had n't changed . " We were supposed to have chopped a hole right through it . If we can do that , it would look as though a piece of orbiting space junk had impacted the satellite . That 's the kind of energy concentration we were looking for . " " But you can now destroy any American satellite you wish ! " " Bright Star was n't built to destroy satellites , Colonel . We can already do that easily enough . " And Bondarenko got the message . Bright Star had , in fact , been built for that specific purpose , but the power breakthrough that had justified the funding for the installation exceeded expectations by a factor of four , and Pokryshkin wanted to make two leaps at once , to demonstrate an antisatellite capability and a system that could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though not in the usual sense . Bondarenko set that aside and thought about what he 'd seen . What had gone wrong ? It must have been thermal blooming . As the laser beams chopped through the air , they 'd transferred a fractional amount of their power as heat in the atmosphere . This had roiled the air , disturbing the optical path , moving the beam on and off the target and also spreading the beam wider than its intended diameter . But despite that , it had still been powerful enough to melt metal one hundred eighty kilometers away ! the Colonel told himself . This was no failure . It was a giant leap toward a wholly new technology . " Any damage to the system ? " the General asked the project director . " None , otherwise we 'd not have gotten the follow-up image . It would appear that our atmospheric-compensation measures are sufficientfor the imaging beam but not for the high-power transmission . Half a success , Comrade General . " " Yes . " Pokryshkin rubbed his eyes for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have demonstrated great progress tonight , but there is still more work to be done . " " And that 's my job , " Morozov 's neighbor said . ' We 'll solve this son of a bitch ! " " Do you need another man for your team ? " " It 's part mirrors and part computers . How much do you know about those ? " " That is for you to decide . When do we begin ? " " Tomorrow . It 'll take twelve hours for the telemetry people to organize their data . I 'm going to catch the next bus back to my flat and have a drink . My family is away for another week . Care to join me ? " " What do you think that was ? " Abdul asked . They had just gotten to the top of a ridge when the meteor had appeared . At least , it had looked like a meteor 's fiery track across the sky at first . But the thin golden line had hung there , and actually marched upward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A thin golden line , the Archer thought . The air itself had glowed . What made the air do that ? He forgot where and who he now was for a moment , thinking back to his university days . Heat made air do that . Only heat .

Even if the upward stroke had been an illusion  --  and he was n't sure of that ; eyes could play tricks  --  the golden line had lasted for nearly five seconds. 114  --  TOM CLANCY Perhaps longer , the Archer reflected . Your mind could n't measure time either . Hmph . He sat down abruptly and pulled out his note pad . The CIA man had given him that and told him to keep a diary of events . A useful thing to do ; it had n't ever occurred to him . He wrote down the time , date , place , and approximate direction . In a few more days he 'd he heading back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interesting . One if by LandT was dark when he arrived . Gregory 's driver came offthe George Washington Parkway toward the Pentagon 's Mall entrance . The guard raised the gate , allowing the nondescript government Ford  --  the Pentagon was buying Fords this year  --  to proceed up the ramp , loop around the handful of parked cars , and drop him off at the steps right behind a shuttle bus . Gregory knew the routine well enough : show the guard the pass , walk through the metal detector , then down the corridor filled with state flags , past the cafeteria , and down the ramp to the shopping arcade lit and decorated in the style of a 12th-century dungeon . In fact , Gregory had played Dungeons and Dragons in high school , and his first trip to the dreary polygon of a building had convinced him that the authors ' inspiration had come from this very place . The Strategic Defense Initiative Office was beneath the Pentagon 's shopping concourse ( its entrance , in fact , directly under the pastry shop ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the bus and taxi stand  --  before the advent of car bombs had persuadedthe nation 's defense community that automobiles were not all that fine a thing to have under the E-ring . This portion of the building , therefore , was the newest and most secure office  --  for the nation 's newest and least secure military program . Here Gregory took116  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  117out his other pass . He showed it to the four people at the security desk , then held it against the wall panel that interrogated its electromagneticcoding and decided that the Major could enter . This took him through a waiting room to double glass doors . He smiled at the receptionist as he went through , then at General Parks 's secretary . She nodded back , but was annoyed to be staying so late and was not in a smiling mood . Neither was Lieutenant General Bill Parks . His spacious office included a desk , a low table for coffee and intimate talks , and a larger conference table . The walls were covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numerous models of real and imagined space vehicles . . . and weapons . Parks was usually a genial man . A former test pilot , he 'd marched through a career so accomplishedthat one would expect a bluff-hearty handshaker to have done it . Instead , Parks was an almost monkish person , with a smile that was at once engagingly shy and quietly intense . His many ribbons did not adorn his short-sleeved shirt , only a miniature of his command-pilot'swings . He did n't have to impress people with what he 'd done . He could do so with what he was . Parks was one of the brightest people in government , certainly in the top ten , perhaps in the top one . Gregory saw that the General had company tonight . " We meet again , Major , " Ryan said , turning . In his hands was a ring binder of perhaps two hundred pages that he was halfway through . Gregory came to attention  --  for Parks  --  and reported-as-ordered , sir . " I low was the flight ? " " Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place ? I 'm a little dried nut . " I ' . rrks grinned tot half a second . " Go ahead , we 're not in that much ( 1 . t burr " 1 n has c to love t he kid , " the General said after the door closed behind him " I N nde ! If his ntonn knows what he 's doing after school . " Ryan rhukklcd , then turned serious . " I is has n't seen any of this yet , right ? " " No , we did n't have time , and the Colonel from the Cobra Belle wo n't Ix  --  here for another five hours . " ) . - ck nodded . That was why the only CIA people here were himself and Art Graham from the satellite unit . Everyone else would get a de cut night 's sleep while they prepared the full briefing for tomorrowmorning . Parks could have skipped it himself and left the work to his senior scientists , but he was n't that sort of man . The more Ryan saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fulfilled the first definition of a leader . He was a man with a vision  --  and it was a vision with which Ryan agreed . Here was a senior man in uniform who hated nuclear weapons . That was n't terribly unusual  --  people in uniform tend to be rather tidy , and nuclear weapons make for a very untidy world . Quite a few soldiers , sailors , and airmen had swallowed their opinions and built careers around weapons that they hoped would never be used . Parks had spent the last ten years of his career trying to find a way to eliminate them . Jack liked people who tried to swim against the tide . Moral courage was more rare a commoditythan the physical kind , a fact as true of the military profession as any other . Gregory reappeared with a can of Coca-Cola from a machine near the door . Gregory did n't like coffee . It was time for work . " What gives , sir ? " " We have a videotape from Cobra Belle . They were up to monitor a Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  blew , but the mission commander decided to stay up and play with his toys . This is what he saw . " The General lifted the remote-control for the VCR and thumbed the Play button . " That 's Cosmos-1810 , " Art Graham said , handing over a photograph . " It 's a recon bird that went bad on them . " " Infrared picture on the TV , right ? " Gregory asked , sipping at his Coke . " God ! " What had been a single dot of light blossomed like an exploding star in a science-fiction movie . But this was n't science fiction . The picture changed as the computerized imaging system fought to keep up with the energy burst . At the bottom of the screen a digital display appeared , showing the apparent temperature of the glowing satellite . In a few seconds the image faded , and again the computer had had to adjust to keep track on the Cosmos . There was a second or two of static on the screen , then a new image began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satellite went over Hawaii a few orbits later , " Graham said . " We have cameras there to eyeball the Russian satellites . Look at the shot I gave you . " " Before ' and After , ' right ? " Gregory 's eyes flicked from one image118  --  TOM CLANCY to another . " Solar panels are gone . . . wow . What 's the body of the satellite made of ? " " Aluminum , for the most part , " Graham said . " The Russians go in for ruggeder construction than we do . The internal frames may be made of steel , but more likely titanium or magnesium . " " That gives us a top-end figure for the energy transfer , " Gregory said . " They killed the bird . They got it hot enough to fry the solar cells right off , and probably enough to disrupt the electrical circuitry inside . What height was it at ? " " One hundred eighty kilometers . " " Sary Shagan or that new place Mr. Ryan showed me ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " But the new power lines are n't finished yet . " " Yeah , " Graham observed . " They can at least double the power we just saw demonstrated . Or at least they think they can . " His voice was that of a man who had just discovered a fatal disease at work on a family member . " Can I see the first sequence again ? " Gregory said . It was almost an order . Jack noted that General Parks carried it out at once . This continued for another fifteen minutes , with Gregory standing a bare three feet from the television monitor , drinking his Coke and staring at the screen . The last three times , the picture was advanced frame by frame while the young Major took notes at every one . Finally he 'd had enough . " I can have you a power figure in half an hour , but for the moment , I think they 've got some problems . " " Blooming , " General Parks said . " And aiming difficulty , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I need some time to work , and a good calculator . I left mine at work , " he admitted sheepishly . There was an empty pouch on his belt , next to his beeper . Graham tossed one over , an expensive Hewlett-Packard programmable . " What about the power ? " Ryan asked . " I need some time to give you a good number , " Gregory said as though to a backward child . " Right now , at least eight times anything we can do . I need a quiet place to work . Can I use the snack room ? " he asked Parks . The General nodded , and he left . " Eight times . . . " Art Graham observed . " Christ , they might be able to smoke the DSPS birds . It 's for damned sure they can wreck any communications satellite they want . Well , there are ways to protect them ... " Ryan felt a little left out . His education was in history and economics , and he had n't quite learned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " General Parks breathed as he poured some coffee . " At least three years ahead of us . " " Only in power throughput , " Graham said . Jack looked from one to another , knowing the significance of what they were worried about , but not its substance . Gregory came back in twenty minutes . " I make their peak power output something between twenty-five and thirty million watts , " he announced . " If we assume six lasers in the transmission assembly , that 's  --  well , that 's enough , is n't it ? It 's just a matter of racking enough of them together and directing them at a single target . " That 's the bad news . The good news is , they definitely had bloomingproblems . They only delivered peak power on target for the first few thousandths of a second . Then it started blooming out on them . Their average power delivery was between seven and nine megawatts . And it looks like they had an aiming problem on top of the blooming . Either the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth 's rotational jitter . Or maybe both . Whatever the actual reason , they have trouble aiming more accurately than three seconds of arc . That means they 're only going to accurate plus or minus two hundred forty meters for a geostationary satellite  --  of course , those targets are pretty stationary , and the movement factor could count either way . " " How 's that ? " Ryan asked . " Well , on one hand , if you 're hitting a moving target  --  and lowearth-orbitbirds move across the sky pretty fast ; something like eight thousand meters per second  --  there are fourteen hundred meters per degree of arc ; so we 're tracking a target that 's moving about five degrees per second . Okay so far ? Thermal blooming means that the laser is giving up a lot of its energy to the atmosphere . If you 're tracking across the sky rapidly , you keep having to drill a new hole in the air . But it takes time for the bloom to get real bad  --  and that helps you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vibration problems , every time you change your aiming point , you add a new variable intoyour targeting geometry , and that makes things a lot worse . Shooting at a fairly stationary target , like a communications satellite , you simplifyyour aiming problem , but you keep shooting up the same thermalbloom until you lose almost all your energy into the air . See what I mean ? " Ryan grunted agreement , though his mind had again reached beyond its limit . Ile barely understood the language the kid was speaking , and the inf rrmation Gregory was trying to communicate was in a field that he simply did n't understand . Graham jumped in . " Are you telling me we do n't have to worry about this ? " " No , sir ! If you got the power , you can always figure out how to deliver it . Hell , we 've already done that . That 's the easy part . " " As I told you , " the engineer told Morozov , " the problem is n't getting the lasers to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The hard part is delivering the energy to the target . " " Your computer can not correct for  --  what ? " " It must be a combination of things . We 'll be going over that data today . The main thing ? Probably the atmospheric-compensation programming . We 'd thought that we could adjust the aiming process to eliminate blooming  --  well , we did n't . Three years of theoretical work went into yesterday 's test . My project . And it did n't work . " He stared off at the horizon and frowned . The operation on his sick child had n't quite been successful but , the doctors said , there was still hope . " So the increase in laser output came from this ? " Bondarenko asked . " Yes . Two of our younger people  --  he 's only thirty-two and she 's twenty-eight  --  came up with a way to increase the diameter of the lasing cavity . What we still need to do , however , is come up with better control of the wiggler magnets , " Pokryshkin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free-electron laser that both sides were working on was that one could " tune " it much like a radio , choosing the light frequency that one wished to transmit  --  orthat was the theory . As a practical matter , the highest power output was always in about the same frequency range  --  and it was the wrong one . If they 'd been able to put out a slightly different frequency the day before  --  one that penetrated the atmosphere moreefficiently  --  the thermal blooming might have been reduced by fifty percent or so . But that meant controlling the superconducting magnetsbetter . They were called wigglers because they induced an oscillatingmagnetic field through the charged electrons in the lasing cavity . Unfortunately , the breakthrough that made the lasing cavity larger had also had an unexpected effect on their ability to control magnetic-field flux . There was no theoretical explanation for this as yet , and the thinking of the senior scientists was that there was a minor , though undiscovered , engineering problem in the magnet design . The senior engineers , of course , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for what was happening , because they knew the magnets worked properly . The arguments that had already rocked the conference rooms were spirited but cordial . A number of very bright people were struggling together to find Truththescientific kind that did not depend on human opinion . Bondarenko 's mind reeled at the details even as he scribbled down his notes . He 'd thought himself knowledgeable on lasers  --  he had , after all , helped to design a wholly new application for them  --  but looking at the work that had been done here , he thought himself a toddling child wandering through a university laboratory and wonderingat the pretty lights . The principal breakthrough , he wrote , was in the lasing-cavity design . It allowed the enormous increase in power output , and had been made over a table in the canteen when an engineer and a physicist had jointly stumbled across a piece of Truth . The Colonel smiled to himself . Pravda was actually the word they used . " Truth " was the exact translation , and the two young academicians had spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had gained currency at Bright Star , and Bondarenko wondered how much of that was an inside joke of some sort or another . " But is it pravilno , " they would ask of a fact . " Is it truthful ? " Well , he told himself , one thing was truthful enough . Those two people who 'd met to discuss their love life  --  Bondarenko had already heard the story in greater detail  --  over a canteen table had combined to make a colossal leap forward in laser power . The rest would come in good time , Bondarenko told himself . It always did . " So it appears that your main problem is computer control , both of your magnetic flux field and the mirror array . " " Correct , Colonel . " Pokryshkin nodded agreement . " And we need some additional funding and support to correct these difficulties. 122  --  TOM CLANCYYou must tell them in Moscow that the most important work has already been done , and proven to work . " " Comrade General , you have won me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely have the intelligence to perceivethe truth ! " Both men had a good laugh as they shook hands . Bondarenko could n't wait for the flight back to Moscow . The time had long passed when a Soviet officer needed to fear at the delivery of bad news , but the delivery of good news was always good for one 's career . " Well , they ca n't be using adaptive optics , " General Parks said . " What I want to know is where their optical coatings came from . " " That 's the second time I heard about that one . " Ryan stood and walked around the table to get his circulation going . " What 's the big deal about the mirror ? It 's a glass mirror , is n't it ? " " Not glass  --  ca n't handle the energy . Right now we 're using copperor molybdenum , " Gregory said . " A glass mirror has its reflecting surface at the back . This kind of mirror , the reflecting surface is on the front . There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " You should have taken more science courses at BC , Jack . " Light does n't reflect off the bare metal , " Graham said . It seemed to Ryan that he was the only dummy in the room . And he , of course , was the one tapped to write the Special National Intelligence Estimate . " It reflects off an optical coating . For really precise applications  --  anastronomical telescope , for example  --  what 's on the face of the mirror looks like a skim of gasoline on a puddle . " " Then why use metal at all ? " Jack objected . The Major answered . " You use metal to keep the reflecting surface as cool as possible . We 're trying to get away from it , as a matter of fact . Project ADAMANT : Accelerated Development of Advanced Materials and New Technologies Group . We 're hoping the next mirror will be made out of diamond . " " What ? " " Artificial diamond made from pure Carbon-12  --  that 's an isotopicform of regular carbon , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption , " Gregory went on . " If the surface retains much of the light , the heat energy can blast the coating right off the glass , then the mirror blows apart . I watched a half-meter mirror let go once . Sounded like God snapping I lis fingers . With ( ' - 12 diamond you have a material that 's almost a superconductor ( ) I heat . It permitsTHE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  123increased power density , and a smaller mirror . General Electric just learned how to make gemstone-quality diamond out of Carbon-12 . Candi 's already working to see how we can make a mirror out of it . Ryan looked through his thirty pages of notes , then rubbed his eyes . " Major , with the General 's permission , you 're coming up to Langleywith me . I want you to brief our Science and Technology people , and I want you to see everything we 've got on the Soviet project . Okay with you , sir ? " Jack asked Parks . The General nodded . Ryan and Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass to get out of here , too . The guards had changed shifts , but looked at everyone just as seriously . On reaching the parking lot , the Major thought Jack 's XJS was " boss . " Do they still say that ? Jack asked himself . " How does a Marine get to work for the Agency ? " Gregory asked as he admired the interior leather . And where does he get the coin to afford this ? " They invited me . Before that , I taught history at Annapolis . " Nothing like being the famous Sir John Ryan . Well , I do n't suppose they have me listed in any laser textbooks .. . " Where 'd you go to school ? " " Bachelor 's at Boston College , and I got my doctorate right across the river there , at Georgetown . " " You did n't say you were a doctor , " the Major observed . Ryan laughed at that . " Different field , pal . I have a lot of trouble understanding what the hell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job of explaining what it all means to  --  well , to the people who do the arms negotiations . I 've been working with them on the intelligenceside for the last six months . " This drew a grunt . " That bunch wants to put me out of business . They want to trade it all away . " " They have their job , too , " Jack allowed . " I need your help to persuade them that what you do is important . " " The Russians think it 's important . " " Yeah , well , we just saw that , did n't we ? " Bondarenko got off the plane and was agreeably surprised to find an official car waiting for him . It was a Voyska PVO car . General Pokrvshkin had called ahead . The working day was over , and the124  --  TOM CLANCYColonel instructed the driver to take him home . He 'd write up his report tomorrow and present it to Colonel Filitov and later , perhaps , brief the Minister himself . He asked himself over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know the Western expression " stroked "  --  him enough to create a false impression . Not enough , he told himself . The General had done quite a job of selling both his program and himself , but this was not mere pokazhuka . They had n't faked the test , and they 'd been honest in detailing their problems . All they were asking for was what was really needed . No , Pokryshkin was a man with a mission , willing to put his career  --  well , if not behind it , then at least alongside it ; and that was all anyone could reasonably ask . If he was building his own empire , it was an empire worth building . The pickup was made in a way that was both unique and routine . The shopping mall was quite ordinary , a roofed-over promenade of ninety-three shops , plus a cluster of five small-screen theaters . There were six shoe stores , and three for jewelry . In keeping with the western location of the place , there was a sporting-goods store that catered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Model 70 hunting rifles , something one does not often see in the East . Three up-scale men 's clothing establishments dotted the concourse , along with seven for women . One of the latter adjoined the gunshop . That suited the owner of Eve 's Leaves , since the gunshop had an elaborate burglar-alarm system ; this , combined with the mall 's own security staff , allowed her to maintain a sizable stock of exclusive women 's fashions without an overly expensive insurance package . The shop had started shakily enough  --  the fashions of Paris , Rome , and New York do not translate well west of the Mississippi River , except perhaps along the Pacific Coast  --  but much of the academic community came from both coasts , and clung to their ways . It did n't take much exposure at the country clubs for Anne Klein II to become a hot item even in the Rocky Mountains . Ann strolled into the shop . She was a very easy customer to fit , the owner knew . A perfect six , she put the clothing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any alterations , which made life easy on everyone and allowed the owner to discount what she bought by five percent . In addition to being easy to fit , she also spent a lot of her money here , never less than $200 per visit . She was a regular , THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  125coming in every six weeks or so . The owner did n't know what she did , though she looked and acted like a doctor . So precise , so careful about everything . Oddly , she paid cash , the other reason for the discount she got , since credit card companies got a percentage of the sales figure in return for a guarantee of payment . This returned the five percent to the owner , and then some . It was a pity , she thought , that all of her customers could n't be like this . Ann had brown bedroom eyes and hair , the latter shoulder-length and slightly wavy . Willowy , with a petite figure . The other odd thing was that she did n't ever seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the owner think she was a doctor . That and the hours she came in  --  never when it was crowded , as though she were entirely her own boss . That had to be true , and the " doctor " dressed the part . This appealed to the owner . Every time she moved about , you could see the purpose in her stride . She picked up the skirt and blouse combination , leaving for the dressing rooms in the back . Though the store owner did n't know it , Ann always used the same dressing cubicle . While in there , she unzippedher skirt , unbuttoned her blouse , but before she put the new set on , she reached under the plain wooden shelf that you could sit on and removed a cassette of microfilm that had been taped there the evening before . This went into her purse . Next she dressed and paraded outside to the mirrors . How can American women wear thisgarbage ? Tania Bisyarina asked her smiling image in the mirror . A captain in Directorate S of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Directorate of the KGB , she reported to Directorate T , which oversees scientific espionage and works in cooperation with the State Committee for Science and Technology . Like Edward Foley , she " ran " a single agent . That agent 's code name was Livia . The cost of the outfit was two hundred seventy-three dollars , and Captain Bisyarina paid in cash . She told herself that she 'd have to remember to wear this outfit the next time she came back , even if it did look like rubbish . " See you soon , Ann , " the shop owner called to her . That was the only name by which she was known in Santa Fe . The Captain turned and waved back . The owner was a pleasant-enough woman , for all her stupidity . Like any good intelligence officer , the Captain looked and acted quite ordinary . In the context of this area , that meant126  --  TOM CLANCYdressing in what passed for a moderately fashionable way , driving a decent but not flashy car , and living in a style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , America was an easy target . If you had the right lifestyle , nobody questioned where it came from . Getting across the border had been almost a comic exercise . All the time she 'd spent getting her documents and background " legend " exactly right , and all the Border Patrol had done was to have a dog sniff the car for drugs  --  she 'd come in over the Mexican border at El Paso  --  and wave her through with a smile . And for that  --  she smiled to herself eight months later now  --  I actually got excited . It took forty minutes for her to drive home , checking as always to be sure that she did n't have anyone following her , and once there she developed the film and made her copies ; not quite the same way Foley did , but close enough not to matter . In this case she had photographs of actual government documents . She placed the developedfilm in a small projector and focused the frame on the white paint of her bedroom wall . Bisyarina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her current assignment , and knew a little about how to evaluate what she 'd just received . She was sure it would make her seniors happy . The next morning she made her drop , and the photographs traveledacross the border into Mexico on a tractor-trailer rig belonging to a long-haul concern based in Austin . It was delivering oil-drilling machinery . By the end of the day the photos would be in the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City . The day after that , in Cuba , where they would be placed on an Aeroflot flight direct to Moscow. 7 . Catalystso , Colonel , what is your assessment ? " Filitov asked . " Comrade , Bright Star may be the most important program in the Soviet Union , " Bondarenko said with conviction . He handed over forty handwritten pages . " Here is the first draft of my report . I did that on the airplane . I 'll have a proper copy typed today , but I thought that you 'd  --  " " You thought correctly . I understand that they ran a test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test , and I was allowed to inspect much of the equipment both before and after . I was profoundly impressed with the installation and the people who run it . If I may be permitted , General Pokryshkin is an outstanding officer , and the perfect man for that post . He is decidedly not a careerist , but rather a progressive officer of the finest type . To manage the academics on that hilltop is no easy task  --  " Misha grunted agreement . " I know about academicians . Are you telling me he has them organized like a military unit ? " " No , Comrade Colonel , but Pokryshkin has learned how to keep them relatively happy and productive at the same time . There is a sense of . . . a sense of mission at Bright Star that one rarely encounterseven in the officer corps . I do not say this lightly , Mikhail Semyonovich . I was most impressed by all aspects of the operation. 128  --  TOM CLANCY Perhaps it is the same at the space facilities . I have heard such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draw the comparison . " " And the systems themselves ? " " Bright Star is not yet a weapon . There are still technical diffi- culties . Pokryshkin identified and explained them at length to me . For the moment , this is still nothing more than an experimental program , but the most important breakthroughs have been made . In several years , it will be a weapon of enormous potential . " " What of its cost ? " Misha asked . That drew a shrug . " Impossible to estimate . It will be costly , but the expensive part of the program , the research and development phase , is largely com- pleted . The actual production and engineering costs should be less than one might expect  --  for the weapon itself , that is . I can not eval- uate the costs of the support equipment , the radars , and surveillance satellites . That was not part of my brief in any case . " Besides , like soldiers all over the world , he thought in terms of mission , not cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a problem , but a manageable one . The individual lasers are complex and difficult to maintain . On the other hand , by building more than the site actually needs , we could easily cycle them through a regular maintenance program , and always have the nec- essary number on-line . In fact , this is the method proposed by the chief project engineer . " " So they 've solved the power-output problem , then ? " " My draft report describes that in rough terms . My final paper will be more specific . " Misha allowed himself a smile . " So that even I can understand it ? " " Comrade Colonel , " Bondarenko replied seriously , " I know that you have a better understanding of technical matters than you care to admit . The important aspects of the power breakthrough are ac- tually quite simple  --  in theory , that is . The precise engineering details are rather complex , but can easily be deduced from the redesign of the lasing cavity . As with the first atomic bomb , once the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Excellent . You can finish your report by tomorrow ? " " Yes , Comrade Colonel . " Misha stood . Bondarenko did the same . " I will read over your preliminary report this afternoon . Get me the complete report to- morrow and I will digest it over the weekend . Next week we will brief the Minister . " Allah 's ways were surely mysterious , the Archer thought . As much as he 'd wanted to kill a Soviet transport aircraft , all he had to do was return to his home , the river town of Ghazni . It had been only a week since he 'd left Pakistan . A local storm had grounded Russian aircraft for the past several days , allowing him to make good time . He arrived with his fresh supplies of missiles and found his chieftain planning an attack on the town 's outlying airport . The winter weather was hard on everyone , and the infidels left the outer security posts to Afghan soldiers in the service of the traitorous government in Kabul . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commandingthe battalion on perimeter duty worked for the local mudjaheddin . The perimeter would be open when the time came , allowing three hundred guerrillas to attack straight into the Soviet camp . It would be a major assault . The freedom fighters were organized into three companies of one hundred men each . All three were committed to the attack ; the chieftain understood the utility of a tactical reserve , but had too much front to cover with too few men . It was a risk , but he and his men had been running risks since 1980 . What did one more matter ? As usual , the chieftain would be in the place of greatest danger , and the Archer would be nearby . They were heading for the airfield and its hated aircraft from windward . The Soviets would try to fly their craft off at the first sign of trouble , both to get them out of the way and allow them to provide defensive support . The Archer inspected four Mi-24 helicopters through his binoculars , and all had ordnance hanging on their stubby wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to damage them on the ground , and because of this the Archer would be slightly behind the assault wave to provide support . There was no time to set up his usual trap , but at night this was not likely to matter . A hundred yards ahead , the chieftain met at the appointed place with the Major of the Afghan Army . They embraced and praised Allah 's name . The prodigal son had returned to the Islamic fold . The Major reported that two of his company commanders were ready to act as planned , but the commander of Three Company remained loyal to the Soviets . A trusted sergeant would kill this officer in a few minutes , allowing that sector to be used for the withdrawal . All130  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  131around them , men waited in the bone-chilling wind . When the ser- geant had accomplished his mission , he 'd fire off a flare . The Soviet Captain and the Afghan I . ieutenant were friends , which in reflective moments surprised them both . It helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be respectful of the ways of the local people , and that his Afghan counterpart believed Marxism-Leninism was the way of the future . Anything had to be better than the tribal rivalries and vendettas that had characterized this unhappy country for all of remembered history . Spotted early on as a promising can- didate for ideological conversion , he 'd been flown to the Soviet Union and shown how good things were there  --  compared to Afghani- stan  --  especially the public health services . The Lieutenant 's father had died fifteen years before of infection from a broken arm , and because he had never found favor with the tribal chief , his only son had not led an idyllic youth . Together the two men were looking at a map and deciding on patrol activities for the coming week . They had to keep patrolling the area to keep the mudjaheddin bandits away . Today the patrols were being handled by Two Company . A sergeant entered the command bunker with a message form . His face did n't show the surprise he felt at finding two officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Afghan Lieu- tenant with his left hand . In his right palm was the hilt of a knife , now held vertically up the baggy sleeve of his Russian-style tunic .

Finally the Itussi.in turned away to look out of the bunker 's weapon slit . Alnu ist on tit. , the Afghan officer tossed the message on the map table and trained his reply . The Russian turned bark abruptly .

The Lieutenant st re.tmcd , but managed to grab the sergeant 's wrist before the knife reached his vital organs . The faces of the two men were close enough that each could smell the other 's breath . One face was too shocked to be afraid , the other too angry . In the end , the Lieutenant 's life was saved by the cloth of an ill-fitting tunic sleeve , as the Soviet flipped the safety off his rifle and fired ten rounds into the assassin 's side . The sergeant fell without a sound . The Lieutenant held a bloody hand to his eyes . The Captain shouted the alarm . The distinctive metallic chatter of the Kalashnikov rifle carried the four hundred meters to where the mudjaheddin waited . The same thought rippled through everyone 's mind : the plan had been blown . Unfortunately , there was no planned alternative . To their left , the positions of Three Company were suddenly alight with the flashes of gunfire . They were firing at nothing  --  there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help but alert the Russian positions three hundred meters ahead . The chieftain ordered his men forward anyway , supported by nearly two hundred Afghan Army troops for whom the change of side had come as a relief . The additional men did not make as much of a difference as one might expect . These new mudjaheddin had no heavy weapons other than a few crewservedmachine guns , and the chieftain 's single mortar was slow setting up . The Archer cursed as he watched lights go off at the airfield , three kilometers away . They were replaced with the wiggling dots of flashlightsas flight crews raced to their aircraft . A moment later parachute flares began turning night to day . The harsh southeast wind blew them rapidly away , but more kept appearing . There was nothing he could do but activate his launcher . He could see the helicopters . . . and the single An-26 transport . With his left hand the Archer lifted his binoculars and saw the twin-engine , high-wing aircraft sitting there like a sleeping bird in an unprotected nest . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned his glasses back to the helicopter area . An Mi-24 helicopter lifted off first , struggling with the thin air and howling wind to gain altitude , as mortar rounds began to drop within the airfield perimeter . A phosphorus round fell within a few meters of another Hind , its searing white flash igniting the Mi-24 's fuel , and the crew leaped out , one of them aflame . They 'd barely gotten clear when the aircraft exploded , taking a second Hind with132  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  133it . The last one lifted off a moment later , rocking backward and disappearing into the black night , its flying lights off . They 'd both be back  --  the Archer was sure of that  --  but they 'd gotten two on the ground , and that was better than he 'd expected . Everything else , he saw , was going badly . Mortar rounds were falling in front of the assault troops . He saw flashes of guns and explosives . Above the noises came the other sound of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wounded . At this distance it was hard to distinguish Russian from Afghan . But that was not his concern . The Archer did n't need to tell Abdul to scan the sky for the helicopters . He tried using the missile launcher to search for the invisible heat of their engines . He found nothing , and returned his eyes to the one aircraft he could still see . There were mortar rounds falling near the An-26 now , but the flight crew already had the engines turning . In a moment he saw some lateral movement . The Archer gauged the wind and decided that the aircraft would try coming into the wind , then flare left over the safest portion of the perimeter . It would not be easy to climb in this thin air , and when the pilot turned , he 'd rob his wings of lift in the quest for speed . The Archer tapped Abdul on the shoulder and began running to the left . He made it a hundred meters when he stopped and looked again for the Soviet transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , bouncing across the frozen , uneven ground as it accelerated . The Archer stood to give the missile a better look at the target , and inuucdiatcly the seeker chirped on finding the hot engines against the wld , moonless night. " ' t ) ne , " the copilot shouted over the noise of battle and engines . f Its eves were l ( tked on the instruments while the pilot fought to hold the auk straight . " V-R  --  rotate ! " I he pilot cased ha ' k on the yoke . The nose came up , and the An-26 took . t final ix mike off the hard dirt strip . The copilot instantly rctr.i to I the landing ; gear to reduce drag , allowing the plane to speed tip that nnt h qulL ker . The pilot brought the aircraft into a gentle tght t ur n to avoid what seemed to be the heaviest concentration of ground fire . ( ) nce clear , he 'd come back to the north for Kabul and safety Behind him , the navigator was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deploying parachute flares every five seconds . These were not to help the troops on the ground , though they did have that effect . They were to fool ground-launched missiles . The manual said to deploy one every five seconds . The Archer timed the flares carefully . He could hear the change in the seeker 's tone when they fell clear of the aircraft 's cargo hatch and ignited . He needed to lock on to the plane 's left-side engine and to time his shot carefully if he wanted to hit his target . In his mind he had already measured the point of closest approach  --  about nine hundred meters  --  and just before reaching it , the aircraft ejected another flare . A second later , the seeker returned to its normal acquisitiontone , and he squeezed the trigger . As always , it was almost a sexual release when the launcher tube bucked in his hands . The sounds of battle around him vanished as he concentrated on the speeding dot of yellow flame . The navigator had just released another flare when the Stinger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of outrage  --  themanual was wrong ! The flight engineer had no such thoughts . Automatically , he punched the " emergency-kill " switch to the numberoneturbine . That shut down the fuel flow , cut off all electrical power , feathered the propeller , and activated the fire extinguisher . The pilot pushed the rudder pedal to compensate for left yaw induced by the loss of portside power and pushed the nose down . That was a dangerouscall , but he had to measure speed against altitude , and he decided that he needed speed most of all . The engineer reported that the left-side fuel tank was punctured , but it was only a hundred kilometers to Kabul . What came next was worse : " Fire warning light on number one ! " " Pull the bottle ! " " Already done ! Everything 's off . " The pilot resisted the temptation to look around . He was only a hundred meters above the ground now , and could n't allow anything to interfere with his concentration . His peripheral vision caught a flash of yellow-orange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went from the horizon to his airspeed and altimeter and back again . " Losing altitude , " the copilot reported . " Ten degrees more flaps , " the pilot ordered . He reckoned that he134  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL OF THE KREMLIN  --  135had enough speed now to risk it . The copilot reached down to deploy them ten degrees farther , and so doomed the aircraft and its passengers . The missile explosion had damaged the hydraulic lines to the leftsideflaps . The increased pressure needed to change the setting rupturedboth the lines , and the flaps on the left wing retracted without warning . The loss of left-lift nearly snap-rolled the aircraft , but the pilot caught it and leveled out . Too many things were going wrong at once . The aircraft started sinking , and the pilot screamed for more power , knowing that the right-side engine was already firewalled . He prayed that getting into the ground effect might save his bird , but just holding her straight was nearly impossible , and he realized that they were sinking too fast in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the last moment the pilot switched on his landing lights to find a flat spot . He saw only a field of rocks , and used his last vestige of control to aim his falling bird between the two biggest . A second before the aircraft hit the ground he snarled a curse , not a cry of despair , but one of rage . For a moment the Archer thought that the aircraft might escape . The flash of the missile was unmistakable , but for several seconds there was nothing . Then came the trailing tongue of flame that told him that his target was fatally injured . Thirty seconds after that , there was an explosion on the ground , perhaps ten kilometers away , not far from the planned escape route . He 'd he able to see what he 'd done before dawn . But he turned back now , hearing the sputtering whine of a helicopter overhead . Abdul had already discarded the old launch tube and attached the acquisition/guidance package to a new tube with . r speed that wutrlll have done a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Archer searched the skies for yet another tai getThough he did n't know it , the attack on Ghazni was falling apart . The . tiovret commander had reacted instantly to the sound of guntrrethe Afghan Arntv'l'hrce ( ; ompanv was still shooting at nothing at all , and the Soviet officer there could n't get things going righthis men into their positions in a matter of two hectic minutes ' I he Afghans now faced a fully alerted battalion of regular u ( ) I , s , %ill , l  --  Kted by heavy weapons and hidden in protective bunker Witherurt , rn.tchine-gun fire halted the attack wave two hundredmeters from the Soviet positions . The chieftain and the defecting Major tried to get things going again by personal example . A ferociouswar cry echoed down the line , but the chieftain stood directly into a line of tracers that transfixed him for nearly a second before he was thrown aside like a child 's toy . As generally happens with primitive troops , the loss of their leader broke the heart of the attack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received by the unit leaders . At once , the mudjaheddin disengaged , firing their weapons wildly as they pulled back . The Soviet commanderrecognized this for what it was , but did not pursue . He had helicopters for that . The Archer knew something was wrong when the Russian mortars started deploying flares in a different place . Already a helicopter was firing rockets and machine guns at the guerrillas , but he could n't lock on to it . Next he heard the shouts of his comrades . Not the reckless howls of the advance , they were the warning cries of men in retreat . He settled down and concentrated on his weapon . His services would really be needed now . The Archer ordered Abdul to attach his spare seeker unit to another missile tube . The teenager had it done in under a minute . " There ! " Abdul said . " To the right . " " I see it . " A series of linear flashes appeared in the sky . A Hind was firing its rocket pods . He trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition sound . He did n't know the range  --  one can not judge distances at night  --  but he 'd have to risk it . The Archer waited until the sound was completely steady and fired off his second Stinger of the night . The pilot of the Hind saw this one . He 'd been hovering a hundred meters above the burning parachute flares , and pushed his collective control all the way down to dive among them . It worked . The missile lost lock and ran straight at one , missing the helicopter by a bare thirty meters . The pilot immediately pivoted his aircraft and ordered his gunner to salvo ten rockets back down the missile 's flight path . The Archer fell to the ground behind the boulder he 'd selected for his perch . The rockets all fell within a hundred meters of his position . So it was man against man this time . . . and this pilot was a clever one . He reached for the second launcher . The Archer regularlyprayed for this situation. 136  --  TOM CLANCY THE CARDINAL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Where would he be ? The pilot swept to leeward , using the wind , as he 'd been taught , to mask his rotor noise . He called in for flares on this side of the perimeter and got a response almost instantly . The Soviets wanted every missile-shooter they could get . While the other airborne helicopterpounded the retreating mudjaheddin , this one would track down their SAM support . Despite the danger involved , it was a mission for which the pilot lusted . The missileers were his personal enemy . He kept clear of the known range of the Stinger and waited for the flares to light the ground . The Archer was again using his seeker to search for the helicopter . It was an inefficient way to search , but the Mi-24 would be somewhere in an arc that his knowledge of Soviet tactics could easily predict . Twice he got chirps and lost them as the helicopter danced left and right , altering altitude in a conscious effort to make the Archer 's job impossible . This was truly a skilled enemy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more satisfying . Flares were dotting the sky above him , but he knew that the flickering light made for poor viewing conditions as long as he kept still . " I see movement , " the Hind 's gunner reported . " Ten o'clock . " " Wrong place , " the pilot said . He brought his cyclic control to the right and slid horizontally as his eyes searched the ground . The Soviets had captured several of the American Stingers , and had tested them exhaustively to determine their speed , range , and sensitivity . I le figured himself to he at least three hundred meters beyond its range , and if fired upon , he 'd use the missile 's track to fix his target , then rush to get the missileer before he could shoot again . " Get a smoke rocket , " the Archer said . Abdul had only one of those . It was a small , finned plastic device , little more than a toy . It had been developed for the training of U.S. Air Force pilots , to simulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at them . At a cost of six dollars , all it could do was fly in a fairly straight line for a few seconds while leaving a trail of smoke . They 'd been given to the mudjaheddin merely as a means to scare Soviet flyers when their SAMs had run out , but the Archer had found a real use for them . Abdul ran a hundred meters and set it up on the simple steel-wire launcher . He came back to his master 's side , trailing the launching wire behind him . " Now , Russian , where are you ? " the Archer asked the night . " Something to our front , something moved , I am sure of it , " the gunner said . " Let 's see . " The pilot activated his own controls and fired two rockets . They hit the ground two kilometers away , well to the Archer'sright . " Now ! " the Archer shouted . He 'd seen where the Russian had launched from , and had his seeker on the spot . The infrared receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving flame of a rocket , butbefore he could maneuver , it was clear that the missile would misshim . It had been launched close to where he 'd fired before . " I have you now ! " he shouted . The gunner started pouring machinegunfire at the spot . The Archer saw the tracers and heard the bullets sprinkling the ground to his right . This one was good . His aim was nearly perfect , but in firing his own guns , he gave the Archer a perfect point of aim . And the third Stinger was launched . " Two of them ! " the gunner shouted over the intercom . The pilot was already diving and veering , but he had no flares around him this time . The Stinger exploded against a rotor blade and the helicopter fell like a stone . The pilot managed to slow his descent , but still hit the ground hard . Miraculously there was no fire . A moment later armed men appeared at his window . One , the pilot saw , was a Russian captain . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , " the pilot gasped . The Archer was already moving . He had tested Allah 's favor enough for one night . The two-man missile team left the empty launcher tubes behind and ran to catch up with the retreating guerrillas . If the Soviet troops had pursued , they might have caught them . As it was , their commander kept them in place , and the sole surviving helicopter was content to circle the encampment . Half an hour later he learned that his chieftain was dead . The morning would bring Soviet aircraft to catch them in the open , and the guerrillas had to reach the rockfields quickly . But there was one more thing to do . The Archer took Abdul and three men to find the transport that he 'd killed . The price of the Stinger missiles was the inspection of every downed aircraft for items in which the CIA might have interest. 138  --  TOM CLANCY Colonel Filitov finished the diary entry . As Bondarenko had pointed out , his knowledge of technical material was far better than one might suspect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the higher echelons of the Defense Ministry , Misha was self-taught in a number of technical fields ranging from gas-protection suits to com- munications-encryption equipment to . . . lasers . Which was to say that while he did n't always comprehend the theory as well as he might have wished , he could describe the working equipment as well as the engineers who assembled it . It had taken four hours to tran- scribe it all into his diary . This data had to go out . The implications were too frightening . The problem with a strategic-defense system was simply that no weapon had ever been " offensive " or " defensive " in and of itself . The nature of any weapon , like the beauty of any woman , lay in the eye of the beholder  --  or the direction in which it was pointed  --  and throughout history , success in warfare was determined by the proper balance of offensive and defensive elements . Soviet nuclear strategy , Misha thought to himself , made far more sense than that of the West . Russian strategists did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pragmatic : The problem , while complex , did have a solution  --  while not a perfect one , unlike many Western thinkers they acknowledged that they lived in an imperfect world . Soviet strategy since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962  --  the event had killed Filitov 's recruiter , Colonel Oleg Pen- kovskiy  --  was based on a simple phrase : " Damage Limitation . " The problem was n't destroying one 's enemy with nuclear weapons . With nuclear weapons , it was more a question of not destroying so much that there would be nothing left with which to negotiate the " war- termination " phase . The problem that occupied Soviet minds was preventing enemy nuclear weapons from destroying the Soviet Union . With twenty million dead in each of two world wars , the Russians had tasted enough destruction , and craved no more . This task was not viewed as an easy one , but the reason for its necessity was as much political as technical . Marxism-Leninism casts history as a process : not a mere collection of past events , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  must  --  cul- urinate in mankind 's collective recognition that Marxism-Leninism is the ideal form for all human society . A committed Marxist , there- fore , believed in the ultimate ascendancy of his creed as surely as Christian , Jew , and Muslim believed in an afterlife . And just as religiouscommunities throughout history have shown a willingness to spread their good news with fire and sword , so it was the duty of the Marxist to make his vision a reality as quickly as possible . The difficulty here , of course , was that not everyone in the world had the Marxist-Leninist view of history . Communist doctrine explainedthis away as the reactionary forces of imperialism , capitalism , the bourgeoisie , and the rest of their pantheon of enemies , whose resistance was predictable  --  but whose tactics were not . As a gambler who has rigged his gaming table , the communists " knew " that they would win , but like a gambler , in their darker moments they reluctantlyadmitted that luck  --  or more scientifically , random chancecouldalter their equation . In lacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a common ethos , and that made them unpredictable . More than any other reason , that was why the East feared the West . Ever since Lenin had assumed control of  --  and renamed  --  the Soviet Union , the communist government had invested billions in spying on the West . As with all intelligence functions , its prime purpose was to predict what the West would and could do . But despite countless tactical successes , the fundamental problem remained : Time and again the Soviet government had gravely misreadWestern actions and intentions ; and in a nuclear age unpredictabilitycould mean that an unbalanced American leader  --  and , to a lesser extent , English or French  --  could even spell the end of the Soviet Union and the postponement of World Socialism for generations . ( To a Russian , the former was more grave , since no ethnic Russian wanted to see the world brought to Socialism under Chinese leadership . ) The Western nuclear arsenal was the greatest threat to Marxism-Leninism ; countering that arsenal was the prime task of the Soviet military . But unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its use as simply the prevention of war . Since the Soviets viewed the West as politically unpredictable , they felt that they could not depend on deterring it . They needed to be able to eliminate , or at least degrade , the Western nuclear arsenal if a crisis threatened to go beyond the point of mere words . Their nuclear arsenal was designed with precisely this task in mind . Killing cities and their millions of inhabitants would always be a simple exercise . Killing the missiles that their countries owned
