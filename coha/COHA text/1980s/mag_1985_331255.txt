Much of 20th century American design seems to have been animated by two competing impulses . One is a kind of mannered childishness , a sometimes arch toymaker 's instinct that produced the streamlined gadgetry of late art deco , the Day-Glo plastics of Pop , the high-tech doodads and joke furniture of today . The other is a reformist urge . When not fashioning playthings , designers turn grave , producing furniture and other objects that are neo- Puritan , high-minded . The severe geometries of Frank Lloyd Wright 's turn- of- the-century interiors and Steven Holl 's beautiful side chair ( 1984 ) , for example , can have an almost oppressive sobriety . As playfulness alternates with the more austere , missionary vision , the American cultural personality seems like a preacher 's child , frisky and slaphappy on Saturday night , dour and repentant Sunday morning . In the battle for America 's aesthetic soul , it is the Shakers vs. the Rockettes . <P> Austerity has tended to lose the fight to pizzazz . Shaker furniture makers eventually abandoned pure folk simplicity ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet by the 1920s , both modes had been supplanted by a new phenomenon : the cult of the machine . Technology cast its spell over the national imagination , and the idea of the future became palpable . <P> The American view of the future , of course , had always been exceptionally hopeful . But once that whiz-bang optimism was hitched to a 20th century faith in technology , popular notions of the future became specific and potent , all the more so as fantasy antidotes to the Depression . A gyroplane for every family ! Aluminum sidewalks ! Houses made entirely of Bakelite ! During the late 1920s and early ' 30s , a remarkable new aesthetic took hold : for an object to look modern , it had to look as if it had been retrieved from the future . Among a good many designers , sentimental nostalgia for the picture-book past  --  Gothic , Tudor , American colonial  --  was supplanted by an equally romantic infatuation with the future , nostalgia in reverse . <P> Some of the shapes , materials and images that resulted are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Whitney Museum , " High Styles : Twentieth-Century American Design . " The show , which includes 300 pieces of furniture , craftworks , tableware and household appliances , was assembled by six different curators and seems more the rough outline of a museum exhibit than a finished show . Indeed , in a gallery that is like the vast attic of some anonymous and impossibly trendy old American family  --  interesting , to be sure , but incoherent  --  the recurrent evocation of the future is one of the few themes reaffirmed by the eclectic jumble . <P> As the new futurist sensibility took hold , mainstream designers showed some transitional ambivalence : a goofy " electric candle " ( 1929 ) on view at the Whitney is unsure if it is supposed to look like a rocket or an actual candle or a tiny fluted Doric column . But the black-paneled Atwater Kent radio from the same period has a machine-age spareness that is , like Fred Astaire , both suave and ingenuous . It is an American synthesis that product design has only lately been recapturing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
