" Of course I do n't . " That was all Rassam had meant to say , but t Ile words started pouring out . " I 've been to the village at the bunder to meet our steamers a couple of times , but I never go near the slave pen . I do n't consciously think about avoiding it , but somehow I just never happen to go near it . Wherever I go , I never see any slaves . I never think about them . I do n't feel any sense of duty undone , any guilt , anything . The slaves are not my affair . They do n't worry me . " " But somehow you never go near the slave pen in the village , " prompted Abd-ul-Kerim . " Why do you remind me ? " begged Rassam . " You know why , " lisped Abd-ul-Kerim . " You know why . " They were silent then for two or three hours . Some of the villagers had gathered together to sing away the spirits of the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rassam said at last , " You talk about the desert . " He had not said anything in so long that the words caught in his throat and came out as a croak , and he had to repeat them . " You talk about the desert as a fire through which the prophets must pass . And here I 've been for more than a year . Some nights , I feel the loneliness of it all . I hear the voice of the wind whispering across the salt flat , and it is n't hard to believe it 's the voice of God . The bats creak by like demons . Serpents glide like slippery tongues across my porch and roof . I do n't know who I am anymore . I 'm not English , but I 'm not Arab , either . The desert has taken me away from myself , burned my old self away , but it has n't given me anything in return . " After a minute , Abd-ul-Kerim said , " Remember : when it is time , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " began the dispatch . The normally dour politicalresident had never before used anything so sentimental as " my dear Mr. Rassam . " It was an immediate clue that all was lost . It was Rassam 's first warning , in fact , since he was still two days short of reaching Disraeli 's speech among his stack of newspapers . " I have some distressing news for you , " the letter continued . " You have been recalled from the Ethiopian mission by the F.O. The telegramcame two weeks ago , on August 6 . I put off letting you know for these two weeks while I made enquiries , but I have no positive explanation . At this point , I would guess we never will have one . As far as I am concerned , you have done a commendable job , cautious but firm , alwayswell within the guidelines of your instructions . Until now , I have heard nothing from London to lead me to believe that F.O. did not share my feelings . There has been the inevitable sniping at a civil servant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen it in the press . I ani certain , though , that the F.O. would not bend beneath so little pressure , and so it must be the political appointment of someone else . I am certain that it has nothing to do with you or with the job you have done.  |p151It  must be particularly painful though , coming as it does in the wake of that letter from the emperor . It looked as if you were almost in Ethiopia , did n't it ? " I suggest that you return to Aden at your earliest convenience , as I have more than enough work for you to do here . " The letter was signed " W.L. Merewether . " Rassam handed the dispatch and the telegram to Blanc , who had brought the diplomatic packet from the bunder to Moncullou . " That is bad luck , " said the doctor . " You had rather placed your hopes in this mission , had n't you ? " " Rather . " " I had hoped to see Ethiopia myself , " said Blanc . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a well-deserved reward . Massawa is boring . Life itself is a bore . But Ethiopia ! " He shook his head in resignation , and for the first time in over a year thrust out his hand to Rassam . They shook hands solemnly . " Send the Times over , will you ? " Blanc asked , and then he was on his way . Rassam sat down on the edge of the porch . He watched the guinea fowl bumbling around in the brush , and he thought them as useless and stupid and misguided as he was himself . There was no meaning to their existence , no reason they should live , nothing to keep them going , but , like Rassam , each of them must be sure it was the most important creature alive . Dahon brought him tea . He drank cupfuls of it through the long August afternoon and evening . Shadows lengthened , the shadow image of the house became a vast angular wash across the sand and brush and trees in front of him . The guinea fowl congregated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . After dark had fallen , a lion roared somewhere nearby . Dahon came onto the porch to collect the tea service . He paused in the doorway as he re-entered the house . " The vipers will be out , master , " he whispered . Rassam did n't move , only stared out into the darkness . " You must come in , master , " Dahon said more insistently , touching Rassam 's shoulder . " It is n't safe to sit in the dark . Come in now , I 've prepared dinner . " Rassam got up , brushed off his coat , and patted down his hair . " I do n't think I shall eat tonight , " he said . " Thank you all the same . " He found his hands involuntarily tugging his tightly cinched collar higher against his throat to make certain it was in its most proper and uncomfortable position . He went into the house , hesitated for an uncertain moment by the billiard table , then went into his bedroom and dressed for bed while Dahon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dahon had blown out the lamp , Rassam tossed for a few minutes in bed . I k ' remembered how Abd-ul-Kerim had told him he would free the slaves when he reached his lowest point . I le experienced a certain small Amon tt of satisfaction that he would prove his friend wrong : he was atp152his lowest point , but he had no intention of freeing anyone . Then he slid into an exhausted sleep . " What would you make of a man like that ? " asked Rassam . " From the first moment he sees you , he glares at you with hatred . He seems to take pleasure from his hatred , to sharpen and refine it , to make it into a work of art . He was just a common seaman . We never exchanged a word , but it was clear that he hated me as if I were the devil himself . " " Perhaps you were , " said Abd-ul-Kerim . Rassam stopped walking , and Abd-ul-Kerim , sensing that Rassam was not following any more , stopped too and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with one hand raised as if in benediction , Abd-ulKerimstood as still as an icon among the leafy shadows of the ravine bottom . " You think I am the devil ? " asked Rassam , bewildered , slightly awed . Abd-ul-Kerim moved at last . His face reappeared from the green shadows . The golden emblems gleamed in his mouth . " We all have our own devils , do we not ? " he lisped . " Who knows what devils possess this man ? " It had only taken Rassam the one day following his recall to pack all his belongings , and now the Suez-to-Aden naval steamer , due the next day , would take him and Blanc back to their old lives as exiled mediocrities . Abd-ul-Kerim had come to Moncullou on the morning of Rassam 's last full day in Africa and , refusing to reveal their destination , had led Rassam for nearly five miles across the plain in the direction of the Ethiopian escarpment , which now loomed ahead of them in the early morning light . They had left their horses in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which a shallow stream of warmish water flowed out onto the plain , only to disappear into the sand a hundred yards beyond the last sheltering vegetation . The path wound through tamariskand thorny acacia trees . The stream sometimes split into tiny channels , sometimes spread into a marshy expanse . Abd-ul-Kerim carried his rifle . " Why would I be this sailor 's devil ? " Rassam pressed Abd-ul-Kerim . " I used to think it was because he was English and I was n't , and he hated me for the color of my skin and my accent  --  but now I am not so sure . " Abd-ul-Kerim answered without stopping or turning his head . The close-hanging greenery muffled his voice . " I can only guess , but I would say it 's exactly the opposite . You thought he hated you for your inferiority ; I think he hated you instead for your superiority . The lower orders are usually color-blind , but they are always keenly aware of the distribution of power . Has there ever been a man who did n't hate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are not an Arab . You are a man of position , influence , dignity , even wealth . You answer to no one that he can see . You can look anyone in the eye . While he ... he follows the orders of a hundred other men . You say he rowed you to shore  --   |p153would  n't you resent someone who could demand labor of you ? Did you give him a choice ? Did you pay him ? Did you thank him ? You were his master , he your slave . You held the power over him to make him do whatever you wanted . Of course he hated you . And of course he would be you if he could . " " Could n't I ever earn his respect ? " " You have it now . He hates you , but it is hate permeated with respect . " Abd-ul-Kerim stopped beside the stream and tested it with his hand . He motioned for Rassam to do the same . The water was very hot . Abd-ul-Kerim said , " Are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest respect for the English , and yet hate them at the same time ? " Rassam had never thought of his feelings in exactly that way before , but he realized that Abd-ul-Kerim had described them with perfect accuracy . " Yes , " he said . " I 've loved them ever since I can remember , and I 've hated them almost as long . My father was one of the great men of Mosul , one of the wealthy merchants . We were an Ottoman city , just on the verge of the Arab world , but while I was young it was the English business interests who were the real force behind our existence . My father groveled before them , curried favor , let them walk all over him . Much like your father with the Turks "  --  Abd-ul-Kerim had walked on , but now he turned his head far enough around to give Rassam a sympatheticnod  --  " and yet different , too . Your father hates the Ottomans and so salvages some of his dignity . My father loved the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I learned English as my first language . I wore English clothes , went to the schools of the English children , grew up with English friends who could barely tolerate me . " I recognized what kind of man my father was when I was about fifteen years old . I realized how little dignity he had kept , and I swore I would never be like him . Outside the home I became a perfect Arab boy . Those were really glorious times for me , those next five years , but then I realized , slowly and painfully , the truth : that an Arab boy might grow up to become an Arab man , but in Mosul that was nothing . All doors were closed to Arabs : Turks and Englishmen held all the keys . I knew then that power was everything , and I swore to become the most complete Englishman in the world . I understood who I was in those days . I knew where I was going . I studied at Oxford , worked with Layard , did all the things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I realize that I have been just as wrong these last twenty years as I was those five as an Arab boy in Mosul . I am not Arab . I am not English . I am neither Abd-ul-Kerim nor Henry Blanc . There does n't seem to be a place for me at all . " " You are my friend , " said Abd-ul-Kerim softly . " That is n't a place like Mosul or Massawa or London , but it is something , is n't it ? " He stopped and turned then , and his expression was so hopeful that li.issam had to laugh . " Yes , " he said , " it is something . "  | " Ah , I 've made you laugh , " sparkled Abd-ul-Kerim , and then he was running on ahead through the winding pathways . Rassam jogged after him , and they laughed as they ran . They had caught their breath and were walking again when Abd-ulKerimsaid , " What will you do ? " " Return to Aden . Go on as I was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , of course . But that is the way politics works . Once again , I have been a victim  --  of power , I suppose . I have too much to suit common seamen , and yet not enough to suit myself . " " It is a paradox . " " Yes . " " An eternal paradox . " " An unsolvable one . " " Not necessarily , " said Abd-ul-Kerim . " How solved , then ? " asked Rassam . " Through politics , through deceit . Play a game that is n't expected of you . Tell me : what is it you want to have happen ? " " To go to Theodore as envoy . " " What is it that would convince them to send you ? " " I could n't use deceit . " " Just play the game with me . What is it that would convince them ? " " My instructions were never really to go to Ethiopia , " he admitted . " I 've hidden it from everyone , even from myself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know now that I was never intended to go to Ethiopia . " Abd-ul-Kerim had slowed . His tone was apologetic . " I knew it . " " Naturally . So ... I 've placed myself outside the situation and tried to analyze the thinking of everyone involved . They know in London that Theodore has told me to come to him with the Queen 's letter , but they know he did n't call me by name , and they may use that as an excuse for replacing me . They know that he is still holding the prisoners at Magdala . If they were willing to take a risk to free the prisoners , I think they would allow me to go to Ethiopia . Since they are recalling me and replacing me , I assume they are n't willing to take the risk at all . Ergo , I can only imagine that the replacement has orders simply to send an ultimatum to Theodore and once he has refused it , they intend to send an army to defeat him . " " You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose , " said Rassam , " but I 'm both close enough to the English mentality and far enough removed from it , so that I can usually dissect English thinking more accurately than an Englishman could . It 's the same as your ability to dissect my thinking . " " Exactly . " " I am certain those are their plans , " Hassan went on , " and the only thing I can think of that might interrupt them would be if the emperorp155released the prisoners , and announced that he was waiting for me , personally , by name , to come to bring them down . That he would chain them again , or even kill them , if I did not come to him with the Queen 's letter . " " Then tell your superiors in Aden and Bombay and London , tell everyone who will listen , that that is what has happened . If you must , forge a letter from the emperor . Then , before the trick is discovered , leave for Ethiopia and accomplish your mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rise with it . Return to England a victorious balloonist . Be welcomed a hero . Be English if you still want to be , or spit in their eyes . " " It can not be done . " " It can not ? Or you will not ? " " Can not , will not , it is the same thing , is n't it ? For me , anyway . It is another paradox . I still want to be English , and therefore I can not violate the moral code of the English which condemns lying . But if I do not lie , I shall not become English . " " I would lie , " said Abd-ul-Kerim . " It would not be the first time , nor the last . " " I am not you , " said Rassam . " Nor I you ... but here we are . " They passed out of the jungle and found themselves at the edge of a glassy-smooth , sandy-bottomed pool . The opening in the foliage overheadlet in vast amounts of sunlight that gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwater . Abd-ul-Kerim yanked off his turban and whisked off his long robe . Absolutely naked , he stepped down to the water , tested it with his foot , and slid in . He rolled onto his back and floated away , kicked awkwardly , then let his body sink to the bottom . Abd-ul-Kerim 's easy nudity stunned Rassam 's Victorian morals for a few seconds , but within a minute he had undressed , piled his folded clothes neatly on top of a dry log , and joined his friend in the hot , relaxing water.  |p157The  steamer anchored off Massawa the next afternoon , too late to chance the treacherous sand bars and reefs until morning brought sunlight and the high tide . The captain of the ship  --  which , by chance , was the gunboat Dalhousie  --  sent word to Rassam at Moncullou that launches would be waiting for him and Blanc at the bunder at dawn . The previous morning , before Abd-ul-Kerim had come to take him to the hot spring , Rassam had read the Times of August 5 . As always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even three weeks late . In that edition of the paper , he had read the text of the emperor 's letter to him . If it had been intentional it would have been cruel , but he knew that reading that hopeful letter on that dismal morning was a meaningless coincidence , and he had shrugged it off . Then , this morning , he had read the Times of August 6 . The newspaper carried an account of Disraeli 's speech in Parliament . It had been so long since the prisoners were chained and there had been so few results that Rassam could understand Disraeli 's concern  --  but Disraeli had gone on to talk about Rassam himself . Rassam 's hands began to tremble as he held the page . He read the article once , then again , more slowly . A man who is not even English , Disraeli had said . Those words had been spoken before Parliament , printed in the Times and every other newspaper in the British empire , had been read by every person whose respect Rassam had ever hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rassam 's saint and god and idol , the man who had overcome his own racial heritage to become the consummate Englishman . A man who is not even English ! Rassam spent the whole day on the porch . There was nothing else to do . Dahon could fetch porters  --  slaves  --  from Massawa on three hours '  |p158notice  . Blanc could handle his own arrangements for meeting the steamer in the morning . Abd-ul-Kerim did n't come to visit , as he might have done on Rassam 's last day in Africa . It was getting on toward evening when Rassam realized that Abd-ulKerimmust have already read Disraeli 's speech . Yet he had not come to Moncullou to see his friend . For several hours , Rassam hated Abd-ulKerimfor leaving him alone in his misery , but then he began to wonder how long ago Abd-ul-Kerim had read the speech . Rassam had not read about Lincoln 's assassination until May 5 , twenty-one days after it was reported in the Times ; Rassam knew from a slip of the tongue by Abd-ul-Kerim , forgotten at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead , that Abd-ul-Kerim had been at least seven days ahead of him . Rassam counted back the days . It was just six days ago that Abd-ul-Kerim had predicted that Rassam would free the slaves at the lowest point in his life . He had already seen the speech , and he had known that Rassam would read it on this particular morning . He knew about Rassam 's feelings for Disraeli . Rassam knew , then , why Abd-ul-Kerim was staying away . Abd-ul-Kerim 's ability to see inside Rassam 's mind was uncanny . But no , thought Rassam , still hating his friend , I wo n't do it . Never . Never . Several hours later , lulled to sleep by an overworked brain and the gentle warmth of the August night , Rassam nodded off . At dusk , the guinea fowl had gathered in the branches of their usual tree . When he woke , Rassam went through the front room into his bedroom . He dropped off the carpet slippers that he had not taken off all day long and put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck , and put on his woolen traveling jacket . He slipped handfuls of shells into his pockets , hoisted his shotgun to his shoulder , and went outside . Dahon muttered protesting noises as Rassam went by him , but Rassam ignored him and walked out into the brush . Shadows loomed around him . He could barely see his feet . He pushed through carelessly , not noticing how the thorns ripped his clothing and scored his face and hands . The moon had risen beyond the tree and silhouetted the bare branches and sleeping birds . Rassam stopped a dozen paces away , loaded his shotgun , and blasted a gaping hole among the birds . Three guinea fowl dropped , fluttering and screeching , to the ground . The moon shone through the hole . The birds around the hole jerked , scrambled , jostled stupidly until they had filled it again . One of them tottered and fell . Its neighbors pressed together and filled its space . So much for a meaning to their existence , or a reason they should live . Rassam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They jostled again . Behind him , Rassam saw Dahon , outlined by the light inside the front room , standing on the porch . Rassam felt cruel , passionless , above all moral judgment , like a wrathful God Whose creations have not behaved the way lie , in Ills arbitrary glory , has decreed they should . The world had treated Bassani unfairly . It no longer made sense to him . The thingsp159he had held dear were chimeras . He released himself from his antiquatedlaws . He fired and fired and fired , until the tree was empty , scarred and torn , branches hanging , swaying in the Red Sea breeze , the ground littered with the carcasses of dead or wounded birds , some still squawking in confusion and pain . He wandered around in the brush for a few hours after he had killed the guinea fowl . Some change in the moisture of the air or some alterationin the sounds of the night told him it was just minutes short of first light before he started back to the residence . The lamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still standing in the doorway . As he entered the yard , though , Rassam saw two horses tethered at the side of the house , and he knew it was Abd-ulKerim , not Dahon , who had been watching him from the doorway . He realized that he had known it all along , and that he had intentionally stayed out in the brush to make Abd-ul-Kerim wait . Rassam stopped in front of the porch . They examined each other . Abd-ul-Kerim 's face was a mass of soft shadows . For the first time this far from Massawa , he had no rifle , nor was there a weapon on either of the horses . " Are you ready ? " the young Arab asked , his voice soothing , his lisp exaggerated . Rassam stepped onto the porch . Abd-ul-Kerim made room for him to pass through the doorway . Rassam laid his shotgun on the billiard table and followed Abd-ul-Kerim to the horses . They cantered across the plain toward Massawa , the first time Rassam had ever seen Abd-ulKerimride at anything less than a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide , but there were men to hold the horses and a boat to take them across . They stepped onto dry sand only fifty yards from the city wall . Abd-ul-Kerim led Rassam into the blackness hard against the western wall . Rassam followed obediently . Yellow threads of light outlined a small postern gate Rassam had never noticed before . Abd-ulKerimtapped a short code against the gate , and it swung silently inward . One of Abd-ul-Kerim 's young Arabs pressed himself against the wall within to make room for them . He held the only illumination , an oil lamp . Beyond him a narrow brick tunnel angled downward and vanished into the darkness . " I do n't have to see them . I know all about what happens to them , " Rassam whispered hoarsely . Then , more truthfully , " I do n't want to . " " You should see them , " commanded Abd-ul-Kerim . " You are going to do this out of pure selfishness . There 's nothing wrong with that  --  oh , no  --  but you should see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and know you are doing a worthy thing . That knowledge may help you later . " Ile ducked through the gate , took the oil lamp , and started down the tunnel . Rassa-n hesitated a few seconds longer , then ran after him . The tunnel descended for a long distance . Finally , when it must havep160been a whole level below the sheik 's basement kat room , it stopped its descent and it made two quick turns to the right to send it back the way it had come . Down this deep the tunnel was dank and cool . Water dripped from the low ceiling , and the wall and floor were slick with wet mosses . There were heavy iron-bound doors with massive locks . " Armory , " Abd-ul-Kerim would whisper as they passed a door . " Treasury . " " Escape route to the mainland . " The tunnel branched a few times , but Abd-ul-Kerim led the way without pausing . At last he halted in front of one of the doors and drew Rassam very close . His voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I was a boy , as they 've been for untold generations of my ancestors . The Turkish eunuchshave always thought their subterranean secrets were their own , but I 'm sure there 's never been a male of my line grown to manhood who did n't know them all . " He produced a key and set it into the lock , and before he turned it he blew out the lamp . The door whispered open and let out a faint , centuries-old commingling of the scents of hashish and wine and perfumeand sweat . They stood in the doorway long enough to let their eyes adjust to the darkness . After a few minutes , Rassam realized the darkness was n't total . Past the door was a passageway so narrow that one man could n't pass another . At intervals of twenty feet or so along one wall , at about eye level , were small lattice panels . Light shone dimly on the panels and reflected brighter on the opposite wall . Abd-ul-Kerim stepped forward and pulled Rassam after him . Rassam found that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blankets to deaden sound in the passageway , so as to make the observer safer from detection . Abd-ul-Kerim 's face appeared for an instant as he looked through the first panel . He shook his head and went on to the next , and the next . Rassam followed . Abd-ul-Kerim found what he wanted at the fourth panel and guided Rassam up to it . The room behind the panel had obviously been intended to imitate and outdo the sheik 's kat room . The walls were hung with fine tapestriesdepicting all kinds of hedonistic pursuits . Between the divans were the remains of a late meal  --  a dozen empty plates , wine , and hashish . Ismail Tasfay lolled naked on one divan and watched through drowsy eyes . The other eunuch , one of the servants from the sheik 's retinue , wore a short shirt of red silk . His legs were bare . From his divan he directed the entertainment . There were four children in the room , aged between thirteen and fifteen . A European boy , totally naked , his blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his back on a divan between Ismail Tasfay and the other eunuch . An Arab girl , also naked , fine-featured , thin-limbed , with small , pointed , raisin-tipped breasts and bony buttocks , knelt on the cold floor beside him and worked at his penis with her mouth . Everything about the couple , the slow rise and fall of herp161head , the bored look on the boy 's face , the way his hand dangled limply off the side of the divan , suggested resignation . Neither was getting any pleasure from the act , and if the eunuchs were getting any pleasure it could only have been in their ability to force weaker persons to perform for them against their wills . It was slavery for slavery 's sake . The eunuch with the red silk shirt held a thin whip in one hand and idly snapped it as he urged them on . The girl already had welts across her back and buttocks . Beads of blood formed a criss-cross necklace across her dark , smooth skin . Even so , she could n't answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a far corner cowered two Africans , a boy and a girl , fully clothed , a year or two younger than the others . Wide-eyed , they were watching the eunuchs and the other children , but they were n't taking any part in the performance . New arrivals , not yet used , perhaps , not yet burned out , learning the things that would be demanded of them . Rassam pulled away from the panel . Abd-ul-Kerim guided him into the main tunnel , closed the door , relit the lamp , and led the way back to the distant postern gate . What Rassam had seen was n't particularly shocking in a world where the exercise of raw power was just part of the game that everyone played . But he agreed with what Abd-ul-Kerim had said : it was better for him to have seen with his own eyes . Outside again , they started around the city walls , and Abd-ul-Kerim said , " It is a good morning for it . The traders have at least fifty or sixty slaves in the village pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high , and the inrushing sea had turned half a mile in a straight line into a two-mile-curve . It took them more than twenty minutes to get around the crescent to the village by the bunder . The sun , low over the Red Sea , shone in their eyes as they left the shelter of the village and walked out onto the beach . Two launches and their crews were waiting for Rassam and Blanc on the beach fronting the village , between the bunder and the oil slick . A bosun 's mate stepped forward and saluted them languidly , but Rassam commanded : " I am Envoy Rassam . You will take my friend and me to the ship . At once . Without delay . " " Your luggage , sir ? " asked the bosun 's mate . He had looked more closely at Rassam and noticed his torn clothing and the ragged stripes of blood on his hands and face . " Damn my luggage ! " cried Rassam . " At once ! " He had never spoken this way to an Englishman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a bosun 's mate , but it made no difference . The old values were so remote and trivial now that Rassam could hardly believe he had ever followed such nonsense at all . " Aye , aye , sir . " The bosun 's mate drew himself up and responded to the kind of order he was used to receiving . " At once . "  |p162The  cadence that the bosun 's mate called out was far sharper than that last time , more than a year before , and the oars dipped and tugged at the water with a sound like clapping hands . Rassam wondered for a moment whether this was the same bosun 's mate who had let the sailors laugh at him and Blanc , and whether that one sailor who seemed to hate him was among the crew , but his mind was such a riot of distracted , conflicting emotions that the wondering disappeared almost immediately . The launch slid alongside the Dalhousieand bumped with a metallic echo . " I 'll send the men above to drop the hawsers , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bosun 's mate , but Rassam just sniffed at him  --  he borrowed one of Blanc 's disdainfulsniffs for a sailor who knew the meaning of English sniffs  --  and pushed aside the oarsmen , who were starting to pull themselves onto the ratlines . His leather-soled boots slipped across the thick , tarry ropes , but he pulled himself up with his hands and scrambled up toward the deck . Abd-ul-Kerim was a shadowy white phantom floating effortlessly at his side . From below , Rassam heard a rough voice whisper , " The blighter 's not wearing nothing underneath . I always wondered . " And another voice said , " Look at ' im , flopping in the breeze . " But Rassam only felt a tiny surge of pity for these English slaves who were making fun of his proud Arab friend . The first mate was on the metal deck to greet them , but Rassam interrupted his salute : " I am Envoy Rassam . Is Captain Easterday still commanding this ship ? " " Yes , sir . " " I will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lines of command between an envoy and a first mate were more certain than between an envoy and a common bosun 's mate . " Aye , aye , sir , " said the mate , and then they were fairly running through the maze of corridors toward the captain 's quarters . Captain Easterday was still asleep , but the first mate opened his door and shook him awake . Rassam and Abd-ul-Kerim pushed into the minuscule cabin behind the first mate . There was barely room for all of them . " What is it ? " moaned the captain , rubbing sleep from his eyes . One side of his great gray mustache flared up toward his eye , and the other side trailed down limply across his chin . He found his wire-rimmed glasses and put them on . Not quite believing what he saw , he looked from the bloodstained envoy to the turbaned Arab . " I am Envoy Hormuzd Rassam , " said Rassam , dragging out of storage his most formal diplomatic tone of voice . " I remember .

" The captain 's expression was one of sleepy resignation . Slavery meant little or nothing to him , but he knew his orders and Rassam 's authority : the lines of command between an envoy and a ship 's captain were even more certain than between an envoy and a first mate . " Exactly where will we find these slaves ? " he asked , but then he thought better of the question . " Benson , " he said to the first mate , " give this gentleman whatever he needs in the way of marines and naval support . Plan on holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's your show , all right ? Do n't hash it up . " " Sir . " " Well , get on with it . " Captain Easterday pulled his glasses off , hid them carefully under his mattress , rolled onto his face , and went back to sleep . Within fifteen minutes , fifty British marines , scarlet jacketed , solarhelmeted , armed with long muskets , had been drawn up in battle order on the deck . They were all young , and somehow they had all found time to shave as they dressed in their combat finery . Their freshly scraped faces were baby-smooth and rosy-pink . Rassam 's own cheeks , after twenty-four hours without shaving , were as blue-black as the marines ' gun barrels , as flinty as the reputed sides of Magdala amba , but now that contrast made no difference . Rassam snapped off jarring orders to all these Englishmen . Blanc had climbed out of his launch onto the ship . He stared around in confusion at the marines , but after Rassam had explained it all to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack , wo n't it ? " and to Rassam 's surprise he was ready to go . Final orders were given , and all the ship 's launches raced across the flat water toward the beach . Minutes later , the fifty marines were drawn up exactly as they had been on the ship 's deck , the only visible change being the sand on their shiny boots . They could not keep the excitement from showing in their faces . Slavery meant nothing to them , either , but a " jolly crack " meant the world . The sergeant major of marines barked out an order that carried far along the beach in the still , dry air , and he and Blanc set out at a jog at the head of a file of ten marines toward the slave pen . The lieutenant of marines barked out an order , not quite as authoritatively as the sergeant major , and the remaining forty marines , with the lieutenant , Rassam , and Abd-ul-Kerim in the lead , set out running in perfect symmetry , with a polished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment , through the village and around the crescent-shaped island . Across the lagoon , the main gates of the city had just been opened for the day . As he ran , Ilassan- could pick out a few members of Rashid ibn Ali 's garrison at the gate , but , busy about their leisure , they did n't seep164the marines until they were within three or four minutes of reaching the gate . The guards fled without even trying to close the gate or fire a shot . The marines jogged on , still in perfect order , still not hurrying , hardly breathing , through the gate into the city . The forty marines split up into two equal squadrons . One set out with Abd-ul-Kerim and a sergeant toward Rashid ibn Ali 's barracks . The other fell in behind Rassam and the lieutenant , and Rassam led it at that jog through the narrow alleyways . Though it was slow and steady , the pace was wearing Rassam down . His boots seemed filled with sand , and his breath came harsh and shallow , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the tattoo of primitive drums , swelling his heart , urging him on . They burst into the square before the palace and instantly formed a line facing it . Two of Rashid ibn Ali 's guards were at the opening in the wall that let onto the front door . One of them bolted into the house . The other started to follow , hesitated , then brought his flintlock musket up to his shoulder and pulled the trigger . The bullet flew harmlessly overhead . For a brief moment , Rassam registered amazement that any of Rashid ibn Ali 's men had taken his duty seriously enough to have his weapon loaded , let alone use it against twenty armed men in defense of the palace . The man wavered before the door , trying to decide whether to reload and fire again or to run , then trying to figure out why no one had returned his fire . Bedouins and Egyptians would have fired back randomly , and they probably would have missed him . The silence was unbearable . The terror of not knowing hypnotized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The lieutenant of marines gave an order . The square echoed with metallic clicks . He gave another order . The marines ' rifles fired so closely together they made a single report . The bullets splattered against the wall and the front door and the man , chips of stone and dust and wood flew , and when the smoke drifted away the man had become a rudely flung rag doll lying twisted and broken across the steps . The lieutenant called out more orders . The marines reloaded , their discipline so great that they performed each step exactly together . Another order , and they jogged , still not hurrying , across the square and vanished in pairs through the front door . Breathing raggedly and glad of the chance to stop running , Rassam walked slowly into the square . There had n't been any shots from the barracks or the slave pen . A few curious Massawans crept timidly toward Rassam . They stared at the blank face of the palace and listened , but they did n't ask him any questions . The people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faceless men , would go on living their heedless lives of desperate poverty as if nothing had happened . No act of Rassam 's , no simple emancipation of slaves , would ever make a bit of difference to them . Rassam remembered some simple words of Abd-til-Kerim . I le had been referring to his father , but he could have been speaking about Massawa herself :  | " Everything changes . Nothing changes . Nothing matters to him . " Rassam realized that those words might refer to himself , too . Then , as his heartbeat slowed to near normal , he had the leisure to be truly terrified . Rassam spent the rest of the day wandering aimlessly around Massawa , sampling reactions to the British attack . First , for no particular reason other than that he was walking in that direction , he strolled into the palace . There had been five full minutes of deathly silence from within . He paused in the doorway : no one , not a sound , nothing disturbedor out of place . He walked into the vast foyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and slow and hollow as he walked . He did n't encounter a single person or see a sign , besides this eerie emptiness , that anything had happened . A rich , familiar scent reached his nostrils from beyond the kat room door . He tugged off his boots and pushed his feet into slippers , then shoved at the heavy door . The sheik was lounging on a divan . A servant was kneeling on the floor in front of him among a collection of containers , burners , pots , and utensils , going through the exacting , time-honored process of preparing coffee : fresh coffee beans roasted , then ground up in a mortar with three grains , no more nor less , of cardamom ; the ground-up mixture boiled , tapped down , and strained through a palm-fiber mat to remove all the grounds from the finished product . The sheik had always enjoyed havinghis servants make a deliberate , graceful ritual of it . He was following his servant 's movements now , but when Rassam pushed open the door he smiled and waved for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheik 's and watched the servant finish straining three cups of coffee . The servant handed two of the cups to the sheik and Rassam , then took the third to the far end of the room , squatted by the wall , and began to sip it with obvious pleasure . After a few minutes , the sheik laughed softly . " So , my clever son finally got through to you , did n't he ? " he asked . " I 've been wondering what took him so long . " " He 'd have done it sooner , " said Rassam , " but it had to be done with his own kind of style . That took a little longer . You are n't angry with him ? " " Of course I 'm angry . Enraged . Furious . I shall never speak to him again , but he is my son , and I 'll take him back if he asks my forgiveness . " " He 'll never ask it , I think , " said Rassam . " He is too proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are right . He 'll never ask it . But perhaps I 'll take him back without it , one day . Who can tell the depths of love in a father 's heart ? Give him my blessing , will you ? " Ile set the cup down on the tile floor and said , " Do you see how things have changed because of this morning ? " " The cup of coffee ? " .. Yes , the cup of coffee . I have no more slaves , so I must pay anyp166servants . For this one , a cup of coffee from his master 's urn is payment enough , at least until he has time to think about it . A simple thing , is n't it ? " " Simple . " " But who can tell ? Perhaps it will not matter , or perhaps it will end this whole way of life forever . " Rassam went off into the palace hallways again and passed along corridors he had never walked before . In some areas he found servants milling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in other areas he found marines standing guard at seemingly random locations . He ran across Ismail Tasfay in one of the tamarind courtyards , sitting beside a tinkling fountain of silver water , lost in thought . This morning was the second time Rassam had seen him since that first night in Massawa . The eunuch felt Rassam 's presence and glared at him with silent , impotent rage . Rassam took a tentative step toward him , but he could think of nothing to say , and Ismail Tasfay hoisted himself up to his feet and glided away . A latticework door closed behind him , and a lock clicked shut . Rashid ibn Ali , when Rassam found him in the street near the barracks , sputtered at him . Where Ismail Tasfay would not talk , Rashid ibn Ali could not . He worked a drop of saliva onto his lip with the intention of spitting it at Rassam , but he could n't control his mouth and it only dribbled down his chin . The British authority was limited to halting the possession or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Porte to punish its own , and so Ismail Tasfay and Rashid ibn Ali were under no censure from the British . There was no doubt , though , that their Massawa careers were over . They disappeared that morning , and it was presumed they had taken passage aboard a northbound dhow that stopped at the bunder to take on a consignment of fifty slaves that never appeared . Paniotti was everywhere that day , standing at a safe distance , watchingit all . Rassam tried to press him for an opinion , but , as if afraid of giving away some secret , he would n't say much . Abd-ul-Kerim appeared out of the labyrinth of Massawa 's alleyways . He was carrying his rifle , and his two Bedouin bodyguards were with him . He grasped Rassam in a tight hug and said , " So , I see you 've finally emerged from the cleansing flame of the desert . I see you standing there radiant as a prophet of doom , with religious certainty in your mind and the deadly sword of justice in your hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rassam . " You know I do n't . " " I think I understand what your father means by the cleansing flame , " answered Rassam . " By the way , your father asked that I give you his blessing . I 'm sure he 'll forgive you as soon as he can without appearing to condone what you 've done . " Abd-ul-Kerim acknowledged it with a faint nod and a smile . " Wep167understand each other , he and I , our mutual contempt and hate and love . There are no problems between us . As for you , my friend : contact me through Paniotti . " " Through Paniotti ? " asked Rassam . " Yes . I 'm leaving too . I 'm going to my own desert . " " To seek your balloon ? " " Do n't make fun , " said Abd-ul-Kerim . " You know I do n't , " said Rassam . Abd-ul-Kerim smiled . " Paniotti will know where I am . Keep your billiards game sharp , and read a book or two to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our friendship , tell a couple of little lies . " He hugged Rassam again . Rassam held him close , unwilling to see him walk away . Abd-ul-Kerim broke away gently , then reached out to touch Rassam 's cheek with his fingertips . In disbelief , Abd-ul-Kerim stared at his fingertipsfor a moment , and Rassam realized that both of them were crying shamelessly . Abd-ul-Kerim hugged Rassam fiercely for one last instant , and then he and his Bedouins were gone . That afternoon , the British marines set up camp in Rashid ibn Ali 's barracks in order to take over the regular defense of the garrison , which , leaderless and afraid , had already dispersed ; and also in order to enforce the new way of things in this corner of the world . The young marines were overjoyed at trading the boredom of life aboard the Dalhousie for the excitement of garrison duty in an exotic port . Rassam and Blanc laughed at that . The citizens of Massawa gathered in gossiping groups throughout that first day . After all , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set loose in their midst nearly a hundred Africans who , for the most part , did not speak the language , did not even know where they were , and for whom there was no place in the community . But by the second morning the freed slaves had somehow disappeared or been assimilated , and the Massawans went about their business as if nothing unusual had happened . " It was just something I 've been meaning to do , " Rassam said , when Blanc asked why he had chosen this particular time to move against the slave trade . For many reasons , Rassam had been most curious about Blanc 's reaction . He had thrown himself into the adventure with a will made keener by a year of boredom , and now he laughed at Rassam 's answer . " Just something you 've been meaning to do . Well , Mr. Rassam , if you decide to hold any more of these little escapades , I really do hope you 'll invite me along . I 've never had so much fun in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news from the emperor , " Rassam went on , hardly flinching at all . " A nu  --  ssenger clone down from him last night and delivered an oral message  --  seems the letter itself was stolen along the way . The emperor has freed the prisoners from Magdala , pendingp168my arrival in Ethiopia to work out the details of a friendship agreement between him and the Queen . The emperor told the messenger to seek me out . Mentioned me by name this time . Apologized for the omission last time , but the messenger had forgotten whether the emperor ever told him the reason for it . " " Then the government has got to reinstate us , " cried Blanc . " Us ? " " Yes , us , naturally . You would n't think of going off adventuring without me , would you ? " Blanc was still drunk with the morning 's excitement , and perhaps did n't know exactly what he was saying . " We will have to let the Dalhousie go on to Aden without us , and take the soonest ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rassam did n't feel the slightest twinge of guilt about what he would come to think of as " my little lie . " He and Blanc took passage to Jedda on a dhow of the tiny sambuk class , high-sterned , low-bowed , awkward , unseaworthy . It took five days to cover the 450 miles to Jedda . Wrapped in their Smyrna rugs , they slept on the deck among crates , chickens , goats , and other passengers : Arabs , Turks , Africans , dervishes , and Greeks . The wind blew fair from the south , cool and gentle . Blanc took possession of a stack of red-dyed leather skins as his daytime chair and nighttime bed , and by the time they reached Jedda the constant sweaty contact had dyed the back of his white suit as red as the leather . He wore the stain as a badge of accomplishment . For the first time in twenty years , Rassam dealt with an Englishman without the least need to impress the man , to imitate him , to become him . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disliked Blanc , and they actually came close to being friends . From Jedda , they cabled their news to London , and then traveled by British steamer to Suez and by train to Cairo . Colonel Merewether cabled his support of Rassam to London . In England , Layard finally found his voice . He told Palmerston , Gladstone , and Russell that he thought removing Rassam would endanger the ex-prisoners , and he rose in Parliament to urge the Members to rally behind the man who had achieved this first vital step toward freeing the prisoners and restoringBritish honor and who had struck such a bold blow against the slavers of Massawa . Disraeli declined Layard 's invitation to respond . When the London newspapers reported the news , public opinion reversedimmediately . Reading the Times of the next few days might have given Rassam some self-satisfaction , but he had given up the habit , probably forever , of reading the English press . In England , Whigs united behind him , and Tories walked about very quietly or spoke on other issues . In Cairo Sir William @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's replacement , was more interested in an exploration of thep169upper Nile than in the mission to Ethiopia . He gave Rassam the presentshe had purchased for the Ethiopian emperor  --  a fine telescope , several crystal chandeliers , mirrors , a rifle , two cases of Curacao  --  and with a hearty handshake and a " Best of luck , my good fellow , and thanks very much for relieving me of the burden , " he departed up the Mother River . A naval steamer was specially commissioned to transport Rassam and Blanc back to Massawa with their presents and their supplies , and by September 25 , 1865 , they were temporarily settled in Massawa once more . Cameron and the missionaries had been prisoners in Ethiopia for nineteen months . Rassam and Blanc had arrived in Massawa for the first time fifteen months ago . Now they prepared to begin their journey into Ethiopia.  |p171Rassam  had only departed for Ethiopia a month before . It would be more than a year before the civilized world learned whether he had succeeded or failed , but in the mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emperor of the Ethiopians had alreadybegun . In his mind the preparations were unfolding as steadily as the punkah fan revolving over the governor of Bombay 's table , as deliberately as the stately dinner plodding along beneath the fan . The punkah groaned . Servants padded softly along the walls . The windows were very tall ; ships ' lanterns twinkled down below in Bombayharbor . A dozen dinner guests were wandering through their usual fog of forced gaiety , suffering in the humid heat , waiting for the short but blessedly dry interim between the summer monsoon and the winter monsoon . Seymour Fitzgerald , civil governor of Bombay and host of this party , had assigned the seating in a careful continuum of interests . At the frivolous end of the table the conversation flittered over rumors and scandals and fashions . At the serious end the voices stayed low , as if to avoid disturbing the guests at the other end . Colonel Dunn was asking , " Am I correct in understanding you to say , Sir Robert , that you would turn down an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinnest black mustache , curled up into points that nearly stabbed his eyes , that had ever been seen in India . His eyebrows were unnaturally perfect , as if they 'd been plucked . No one but the London craftsman who made his toupees had ever seen his receding hairline . His monocle hung from a green silk ribbon that was tangled among the medals on his scarlet chest . The medals were arranged to leave a deliberate little space of red around one : his Victoria Cross . Besides being a dandy , Dunn was widelyp172known as a military incompetent . It was that incompetence that had won him his Victoria Cross and made his career . He had won it as the leader of the fatal charge of the Light Brigade at Balaklava , the charge straight into the face of the Russian guns that had ruined an entire brigade , electrified a nation , and inspired the poet Tennyson . Dunn 's was the only Victoria Cross awarded in the entire Crimean fiasco . With that distinction on his chest , his career was secure . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 33rd Foot , the Duke of Wellington 's Own infantry regiment . He leaned forward earnestly , tapped the tabletop for emphasis , and said in a voice that was meant to suggest that he knew more about military strategy than any mere general , " You would actually turn down troops ? " General Sir Robert Napier , military governor of Bombay , was in his fifty-seventh year , pale and slight , black-haired , with great bushy eyebrows , an enormous mustache , and a long weasel 's nose all hanging off the front of a fragile skull . He seemed out of place in the scarlet tunic that bore the decorations of so many campaigns , including a Victoria Cross of his own , won against the Sikhs . He seemed out of place , too , in the company of other human beings . He appeared to hide in his own world of inanimate objects and mathematical equations , to be attending with only half his mind , as he murmured , " Precisely . " " Sir , I 've served in Egypt , trained Egyptian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was a young Cornishman , Major Briggs of the Sind Horse , so eager to please that he stumbled over his words . He had become Dunn 's protegee , and he was trying to imitate his master in everything . He was in the process of cultivating a mustachelike Dunn 's . He wore a monocle on a silk ribbon , pale green to complement the darker green of his clumsy frock coat , which was the Sind uniform , and he tried to tap the table exactly as Dunn had . " It 's true enough that the Egyptians are n't on a par with our troops , or even with Sepoys . But Cairo could easily send ten thousand of them up the Nile and into Ethiopia through Khartoum . Correct me if I am wrong , sir . They might only trip over their own feet and walk in circles and get lost , but ten thousand troops must surely be a diversion worth having . " Napier mumbled , " There will be no Egyptians in my expedition . " Slowly , searching like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " There is , of course , to be no expedition to Ethiopia , as you gentlemen are well aware . A diplomatic mission has been dispatched to bring the captives home . That mission will succeed . There will be no offer of an Egyptian diversion . " " But are n't you making plans for an expedition ? " asked Dunn , with a superior smirk . " Have n't you been gathering intelligence ? " Even less restrained , young Briggs smiled and said , " All the officers have been talking about it . We 're eager for a fight . " Napier blinked at Briggs , but his expression was unreadable . " It is common knowledge that I have been putting some thought into ap173hypothetical African campaign , " said Napier . " There 's no reason to deny it . But there is not actually going to be any such campaign , and it would be presumptuous to assume that I should lead it if there were . I am engaged in an academic exercise , to keep my skills sharp , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framework for an African campaignshould one ever , at any time in the future , become necessary . It is only a contingency plan , one of hundreds I have developed . That is all . " What Napier had said was a blatant lie , but of course he 'd had to put the lie on the public record . Everyone knew the diplomatic mission was going to fail . Everyone was anxious for war . Everyone knew Napier was the obvious man , in terms of prestige and personal connections and military experience , to command . The one thing that everyone did not know was that Napier knew , absolutely , that there would be an expedition and that he would be the man to lead it . He had received secret instructions from the secretary of war to make these preparations , but it was even more than that that made him so certain . Others might find out about the instructions in time , but no one would ever find out about the other proofs he had . Dunn winked at Briggs and said to Napier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert , just for the hypothetical instruction of two younger officers , why you would not accept a hypothetical diversion by Egyptian troops during your hypothetical expedition ? " Irritated , Napier said , " I have been doing quite a bit of reading about the Ethiopians . I found a book by an interesting fellow named Walter Plowden . " Napier spoke Plowden 's name slowly , very clearly , and then waited for someone to remember . " Was n't he the English engineer who worked for the emperor ? " asked Fitzgerald from the head of the table . " Worked for Napoleon ? " asked Lady Seymour , who had n't really been listening . " Not emperor of the French , dear . Of the Ethiopians , " scolded her husband , and the lady and the colonel at the frivolous end of the table tumbled their laughters together . Twelve years before , if anyone had mentioned Bell and Plowden in Napier 's presence , there would have been smiles and badly suppressed laughter , but most of those at the table had arrived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napier rarely showed a hint of emotion , and no one knew his relief . " This Plowden wrote a small book of his experiences and his observations in Ethiopia , " he continued . " Plowden was not a particularly literate man . As I read the book , I had the feeling that he had written it to show to the emperor and thereby curry favor . His praise of ' the emperor is extravagant and not to be believed . " In many other details , though , I am willing to place more faith in his judgment . He made an interesting observation that might pertain top174Egyptian troops accompanying an English campaign into Ethiopia . I quote as accurately as I am able : To a foreign conquest little resistance would be offered , for the Ethiopians are too imaginative to dream of patriotism . This spirit , which is entirely lacking , has always been suppliedin their contests with the Mohammedans , their mortal enemies , by fanatical excitement . ' " Napier forced his seemingly lazy eyes to focus around the table , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those at the frivolous end , were listening to him . Among imperial Englishmen , there was always an air of being involved in history , but this conversation was beginning to sound like something more than the run-of-the-mill , day-to-day making of history : this might have the makings of a Grand Event . Like the Ethiopians , Napier had too much imagination for patriotism , and he despised those who did not . " I may form a minority of one among the military men at this table , " he continued , " but I have tasted quite enough fanatical excitement to last a lifetime . " " So have we all , " said Fitzgerald quickly . The only real skirmish of his life was now thirty-five years in the past , but he never missed a chance to remind people that he had been a soldier . " Save all the glory for the English , " said Briggs . " That 's what I say . " " Save as many English lives as possible , " said Napier . " Sir ? " said Briggs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red hair , interrupted , " How can this Mr. Plowden call the Ethiopiansimaginative ? I should have thought they would lack an imagination , being savages . They are savages , are n't they ? " Napier said , " The Ethiopian , Madam , in common with his duskyskinnedcousins all across the globe , will surely be found to have an amazingly active imagination . The world of the native is occupied by demons and spirits that may be invisible to you , but which are certainly clear to him . Ideas percolate through his mind . He has only a tenuous grasp on reality , but his mind ranges far . " Napier had fought too many years against too many non-European races , and he was too rational and objective and imaginative not to have gained more respect for Chinese , Indians , Arabs , and Africans than was common to his own people . " One has only to look so close to home as Ireland , " he said . " The skins of the Irish are as fair as our own , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so they will do for an example . Who can deny that their imagination puts our own to shame ? Who has n't heard of leprechauns ? Or of the pagan holdovers in the popish religion ? Walk down a Dublin street and listen to the grimy urchin who begs from you . He has too much imagination to simply ask . He invents a new dodge every day . Enter an Irish pub  --  " " I would not ! " said Lady Fitzgerald . " But if you did you would hear language that glitters , ideas dropping from the mouths of common laborers that would put to shame the dull-witted talk of an English pub . "  | " And you propose , sir , " said Dunn , " that the imagination of the primitiveEthiopians  --  and the dull-wittedness of the English  --  will defeat the Ethiopians ? I admit I do n't follow your argument . " " Having an imagination , " Napier went on , " the Ethiopian lacks discipline . He lacks dedication to a national symbol . What man in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire for fourpence a day if he were able to imagine the pain of a bullet wound ? Would an English soldier risk his life for his beloved Union Jack if he could imagine Lord Palmerston with his pants down on the commode ? " Ladies gasped , Dunn and Fitzgerald looked away in embarrassment , but Briggs laughed out loud . Napier fixed him with another of those unreadable stares . With difficulty , Briggs stifled a laugh behind his fist , but his eyes were still smiling directly into Napier 's . Napier continued : " No army can operate effectively when a common soldier has an opinion . That is the trouble with Irish troops : splendid when we need derring-do , miserable when we need a solid line . We will surely find that to be the weakness of Ethiopian troops . The Ethiopian will not be melded easily into a unit of a greater whole . How the emperor has managed it as well as he has is beyond me . He must be a very great leader . " The common English soldier , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't got an idea in his feathery brain , and so he will bend himself easily to discipline . On this lightweight bedrock is built the British army . It is this difference between the British army and the Ethiopian that makes it impossible for the British ever to be defeated by the Ethiopians . By the terrain and the elements , perhaps , but never by the Ethiopians . " " You have been doing your homework , have n't you ? " said Fitzgerald . " Sir Robert is the most prepared man I have ever known . We all know there is to be no expedition to Ethiopia , but I shall be surprised if he has not already had scouts roaming the African mountains and spying on the emperor 's harem . " The ideas about the different armies were interesting to Napier , but he had finished talking about them , and he had no intention of talking about anything else . Just now , he was directing his distracted gaze toward the mousse that an Indian servant had slid in front of him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fact , I 've had two men , on the Red Sea . Scouting out a base camp . Should one ever be required . Merewether and Phayre . " Colonel Merewether and Lieutenant-Colonel Phayre , seated across from each other , exchanged a pleased , conspiratorial glance and then tried to transfer the glance to Napier , but he was still staring dubiously at his mousse and did n't even see them . Phayre wore military scarlet , Merewether mufti . Phayre was short and plump and red-faced and clownish , Merewether tall and very serious . " What are your conclusions , gentlemen ? " asked Fitzgerald.  | " We 've only just returned , " Merewether said carefully . " We have n't had time to report in full to Sir Robert . Perhaps we should n't say any-thing . " " Oh , I 'm sure Sir Robert has no objections , " said Fitzgerald . " Have you , Sir Robert ? " Napier did n't seem to hear . Fitzgerald took that as consent and waved Merewether on . Merewether was not certain whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not widely respected among military men , and Napier had said nothing . " Go on , " urged Fitzgerald . " Well , it 's a desolate place , if ever there was one , " Merewether began slowly . " I 've served as political resident at Aden for six years , and Aden , as dry and barren as it is , is a Garden of Eden next to the western shore of the Red Sea . " " Can a British army survive there ? " Merewether looked again to Napier , but Napier was apparently lost in his own reflections . Merewether hesitated , and Phayre began quickly , " It is barren , mostly salt desert from the sea to the mountains , but we found plenty of water in natural catch basins and in streams flowing steadily down from the Ethiopian escarpment . " Merewether tried to stop Phayre with a warning look , but Phayre , perhaps expecting it , kept his eyes away from his superior officer . He was obviously delighted to have the center stage , and did n't care what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite high . Away from the sea the underground water is fresh , and a man can dig a decent well in an hour . There is no food , but there is a good harbor , Zula . Very shallow , but long bunders can be built , condensors established , supplies off-loaded , and a base camp set up . Sir Robert is prepared for all that construction , of course . " From Zula to the escarpment is just ten miles . A railroad could be built across this stretch . Sir Robert has made plans for this , too . The ascent is then very steep . Four miles reaches Komayli at iioo feet . Thirteen more miles reaches Suru at 2600 feet , and another thirty miles reaches Senafe at more than 8300 feet . " Phayre reeled off the figures with a schoolboy 's pride . " That may not sound like much , but there are many places that are very hard . However , there is a caravan route up it that should n't be too difficult , even for elephants . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always dips below freezing at night . Zula will not be a comfortable post , but it will be liveable for Sepoys and coolies , and for a few days for Englishmen . As Sir Robert has said , the British army is invincible in battle : the challenge will be getting the army to the battle , and getting them there well-fed and in good health . " " No more Crimeas , eh ? " asked Fitzgerald , though he had n't served in that Phyrric victory of British arms and Russian ineptitude . " That is exactly what we shall not have , " said Napier , abruptly shakinghimself awake , stunning the dinner guests with the sharpness of hisp177words . " Not in Ethiopia and not ever again . This expedition will be run in a way that will be remembered and emulated . It will be organized in the manner of a business firm . Supply and transport will receive the highest priorities . You will see an expedition that is slow , deliberate , very expensive , very boring , and very successful . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . " The only guest who was not English was a businessman from Philadelphiawho had been placed , for lack of information about his preference , midway between the frivolous and serious ends of the table . " That 's a phrase I keep hearing but do n't understand , " he said . " What do you British mean when you talk about your ' new British army . ' I do n't mean to be rude , but your soldiers are still wearing those splendid red uniformsthat gave our revolutionaries such fine targets . Your drill , so far as I 've seen , has n't changed since Waterloo . You 're still using the basic square that absorbed Marshal Ney 's cavalry , are n't you ? What I mean to say is this : to my untrained eye , your army seems old-fashioned  --  that is , tradition-minded at the expense of modern efficiency  --  next to the armies that fought in the American war . " There was a rustle of discontent among the British officers , but very quickly , before anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are exactly right , sir , quite right , and I applaud your knowledge of military history . The drill is the same , the uniforms are still bright . But our problems are very different from those of the American armies . If we were to fight in Ethiopia , we should have to gather an army on an inhospitable shore thousands of miles from either England or India , and then we should have to march hundreds of miles through uncharted deserts and mountain ranges , through territory full of hostile natives , combating unknown medical hazards and severe changes in weather . " The Duke of Wellington never allowed a change in the army ; after all , it had defeated Napoleon . The great man died just before the Crimea , and there we learned how inefficient our logistics were . All that is different now , sir . The army which we would see in Ethiopia would march along trailing an umbilical cord , stretching all the way back to England , composed of ships , railroads , telegraphs , horses , mules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is that umbilical cord , sir , that will allow our unimaginative , disciplined , invincible army to defeat the emperor of the Ethiopians . " " You make it sound quite uninteresting , " said the American . " Had you the opportunity to participate in the American war ? " asked Napier . " I was a captain in the Federal army , " said the American . " I fought at Vicksburg and Chattanooga . " " And did you find those battles interesting ? " asked Napier . " Or did you find them uncomfortable , cold , wet , and bloody ? " " Your point is well taken , Sir Robert , " conceded the American . " I thank you , " said Napier . " If you would cure to see a modern Britishp178army in action , I invite you to accompany us to Magdala . That is , if we were to send an expedition to Ethiopia , naturally . " The heart of the British complex in Bombay was a wide , cobblestoned square . Dozens of tiny , carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splashed and gurgled . Gas lamps were yellow pools in the pale gray of the square . On the rare rainless night like this , Sarah Napier would have enjoyed strolling , seeing the people she knew , sitting in a garden listening to the splash of water . But when she strolled in the square it was always on the arm of some young officer , never on her husband 's . In fact , Napier had never once walked across the square , though for fifteen years he had occupied the sandstone mansion of the military governor of Bombay , one thousand yards from Fitzgerald 's , with this wife and with the last . Napier looked at every event with an engineer 's eye . To him , if a place was worth going to at all , it was worth going to in the most direct , fastest , cheapest way , with the least possible expenditure of energy . Sarah Napier would have preferred to walk to Fitzgerald 's , but she knew that if she could wheedle and threaten her husband into going out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this way with Sarah , and it had been this way with the last wife . On the drive home from Fitzgerald 's , they sat shoulder-to-shoulder in the fine lacquered darkness of their carriage . Napier , isolated as usual in his own world , satisfied with his own excellent company , sat with his head tilted back , his eyes closed . Sarah examined his profile . There was no sign of anything extraordinary in his sharp , long nose , his sprouting eyebrows and mustache , his drooping pipe , but she was certain there was greatness in him . It was for this she had pursued him and married him . " What was said after dinner ? " she said . Napier blinked his eyes , smacked his lips on the pipe stem and drew no smoke ; he busied himself relighting the tobacco he had let go out . Finally , out of a cloud of swirling smoke , he asked himself , " After dinner ? Hmmm , after dinner . " The first Lady Napier had never cared very much for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He always answered honestly and at length , but not before he had pretendedthat it was difficult for him to focus his mind on the question . At last , he began , " After dinner , when we had retired for brandy and tobacco , we talked of the normal things . The governor has a new brandy , excellent . I asked him for the name of his merchant , and he promised to write a letter of introduction for me . I was a bit bored , and I suppose I slept off and on until the American left . He turned out to be a quite reasonable man , and of course he was very perceptive about the British army , but I did not feel I could speak in front of someone not a countryman , do you see ? Then , after he had left , I told the others that I am certain there will be a campaign to Africa , that I know I will lead it , and that I expect to be ennobled as a result of it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sarah gasped . " You simply did not say those things . You 've ruined us . " Sarah sank back against the seat , pulled out a handkerchief and began to sob into it . Between sobs , she said in a quavering voice , " I 'll never be able to face anyone again . Never . We shall have to leave India . " Secretly , Sarah was thrilled at what her husband had said . Finally , he was moving in the direction in which she had always hoped he would go . But she was putting so much heart into her tears that she was sure he thought they were authentic . Napier leaned back and puffed at his pipe , enjoying the performance , content in the game he had created out of his domestic life . The tears stopped in the minute it took the carriage to clatter through their gate and sway to a halt at their front door . " Come with me . " She almost snarled the words under her breath as she took the footman 's hand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napier followed slowly , handed his hat and cane to someone who stuck out a hand for them , and wandered into the salon to pour himself a brandy . When he came back into the hall , Sarah was glaring down at him from the top of the wide marble stairway . He climbed up and followed her to her rooms . He slid into an overstuffed armchair ; she closed the door and sat on her canopied bed . " Explain yourself , Robert , " she said , then smiled in a way she thought was pretty . " Please . I know you could n't have said those things . " Napier sniffed at the brandy , whirled it around in the snifter . " Yes , I 'll explain , " he said . " Would n't want you to worry for no reason . " Then , for a moment he slipped off into a hazy recollection of how this room had looked when it had been his first wife 's . Sarah had changed nearly everything . The only thing that remained the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rosewood , ugly in the manner of the time . Sarah had wanted to get rid of it , but for some reason of his own that even he could n't fathom , Napier had urged her to keep it . The velvet , he remembered , had been scarlet when he had found the Russian general tied up behind it . Napier seemed to remember the velvet as lime green when he had found Henry Blanc sitting on it , collar askew , his hair mussed , the late Lady Napier sitting flushed on the bed . Now , the velvet was blue , but it was still the same love seat . Funny that this love seat should be the only piece of furniture , probably the only inanimate object , to which Napier had ever had an emotional attachment . Napier had spent twenty-seven years with his first wife , and he had been contented . After the smallpox took her , he had been contented with widowerhood . It had never been his intention to remarry , but after he married Sarah , he was contented with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a British merchant , was outwardly plain , and she had n't seemed to have much to compensate , but he had discovered that inside she harbored a smoldering ambition . The wife of the military governor of Bombay was not a big enough role ,  |p180in  itself , to attract her , but she had been convinced there were greater things in store for the woman who married Napier , if that woman had the talent and drive to shake him loose from his decade-long lethargy . She had spent the first year of their married life trying to goad him into action , and he had allowed her to believe she had failed miserably . Her feelings now , when she heard him talk about a campaign and ennoblement , were mixed : delight at the thought , fear that he might fail if he were not guided by her . " So , after the American left , " Napier continued , between sips on his brandy , " this Major Briggs , a rash young sort , asked me point-blank whether I thought there would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly there will be an Ethiopian campaign . This diplomatic mission is a charade . It is designed for failure . The government , either this government or a Tory government , will have to wage war , sooner or later . Major Briggs asked me whether I should lead it , and I told him , yes , I am the logical choice for it , and I want it badly . And then it was Colonel Dunn , I believe , who made the characteristically unsubtle remarkthat the man who leads the campaign to Ethiopia will surely be rewarded . Laurel wreaths , he said , glory for British arms , nonsense of that sort . And Fitzgerald said , no laurel wreaths for that man . Fitzgeraldsaid , that man will be an earl . The others agreed , and young Briggs asked me , again point-blank , mannerless , bold , whether that should please me . Sarah , you know I can not lie . " " I know that , Robert , " said Sarah , still hiding her feelings behind a mask of grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should please me , certainly , but it should please my young wife far more than me . I promise you , I said nothing to reflect badly on us . I told them , ' I am fifty-seven years old , I have a beautiful young wife , and soon I will be ready to retire . I was born in Ceylon , lived practically all my life in India ; in fifty-seven years I 've spent a total of thirty-three months in England . I have served long and well . I believe I deserve the chance to command this last campaign , to win myself and my wife a peerage , a seat in Lords , and an honorable retirement in that English homeland I 've hardly known . " I 've been ordered to make plans for it . That by itself is no guarantee , but I 'm planning the campaign in such a way that no man but me , no one without my skills as a military engineer , could possibly carry it off . " I know my reputation , Sarah . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . I 've cultivated friends in high places . I will have this expedition . I did n't say anything those gentlemen had n't thought out for themselves . " Sarah was staring into her folded hands , trying to hide her eagerness . Napier went on : " I talked about the nature of such a campaign . ' Some of you here will be involved in this expedition , ' I said , singling out Major Briggs and Lieutenant-Colonel Minn " I'here may even be those presentwho will die in the African highlands . My aim  --  our aim , gentlemen  --  must be to please the government , and what will please the governmentwill be that the expedition should be deliberate , expensive , and perfectly successful . I will command as if I were directing the digging of a canal , as if I had all the time in the world . When the campaign begins , the English nation will be ecstatic . The English people are desperate for a symbol to replace the Crimea , the Mutiny , even that piddling war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convert heathens to Christianity as they did at the beginning of this century , though they give conversion lip-service . They do n't need or want more colonies . They just want to crush someone , and then to be washed clean in an orgy of self-congratulation . ' " Major Briggs , who is quite an enthusiastic , idealistic sort , asked , But what about the poor captives , languishing in their prison ? ' " I like this young Briggs , Sarah . Dunn is a perfect ass , of course . The 33rd is too good a regiment for him . All those Irishmen are wasted on him . And Phayre is no better , but he is Lord Russell 's cousin , and I can not touch him . The American took our army to task for the buying and selling of commissions , for our preferring money and connections to military expertise . He might have something , too . I wish there were some way I could replace Dunn and Phayre . " But Briggs , though he bought his commission like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flair , that I especially like . He has much more imagination than I. He would be good to keep close to me , to temper my caution , to relieve my boredom . I think I may gather togethera collection of rash young officers like him and keep them busy with adventures . " " What did you answer him ? " asked Sarah . " I told him the truth , the sort of truth that no one under a certain age understands . As far as I am concerned , ' I told him , and as far as the government is concerned , the prisoners , including this new Mesopotamian envoy , are already dead men . The invasion will be nothing but an outburst of racial pride . No savages will get away with shaming the British crown . No foreigners are going to say we can not handle the heathens . ' " " I do n't have to know more , " Sarah interrupted . " I 'm sure you handledyourself with your usual care and dignity , and I am sorry I doubted you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his warm brandy , and thought about his plan for a band of courageous cavalrymendashing boldly across the Ethiopian plateau . They might not help the campaign , but they would certainly help to relieve the boredom . " I have another question , " said Sarah . " IIrnrnmmrn ? " he asked . " Who was Walter Ylowdcn ? " " 1'lowden ? As I said , he was an English engineer who worked for the Ethiopian emperor . IIe wrote a small hook . Ile died in ' 6o , or there-abouts. "  |p182Sarah  sniffed . " You know how we ladies have so little of substance to talk about when you gentlemen are away , so we clutch at straws and dissect every nuance of the dinner conversation . Usually , our talk is mere drivel , but sometimes we make impressive conjectures . This evening , all the ladies had the impression that you were waiting to see whether anyone knew Plowden 's name . As if he should have been known to us . Who was he ? " Napier did not answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in the empty brandy snifter , and she did not ask again . Napier , truthfully , had felt some attraction drawing him toward Ethiopiaever since he had heard that Henry Blanc was marching into the same remote country that had sheltered Bell and Plowden . In his whole life , only those two hints of scandal  --  Blanc and the Russian general  --  had ever touched him . Outwardly , he was a perfectly emotionless man , but those two incidents had seemed to smash against the walls of his isolation , to threaten the man within . Behind those walls , hidden even from himself , was a fragile man who had nearly been crushed by those two incidents . He could go gliding carelessly through bloody seiges and attacks , look down on the mutilated corpses of men he knew ; yet those assaults on his dignity had very nearly killed him . From the first moment he had heard about Blanc 's journey to Ethiopia , Napier had known that he , too , would be going there . The coincidencewas too obvious , too elegant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his grand opponent , in this game into which he had made his life . He knew there would be an expedition to Ethiopia , and that he would lead it . While Napier sat in his armchair , thinking about Bell and Plowden and Blanc and that band of courageous young cavalrymen  --  and pretendingnot to notice his wife  --  Sarah dimmed the gas lamps and preparedherself for bed . She pulled off her gown , her corset , her shoes and stockings and petticoats and bloomers , and , totally naked , stood in front of Napier for one full , hopeful minute , letting her long hair down and running a silver-backed brush through it . Her face was flat and plain , but her body was almost perfect : pale creamy skin , long , graceful legs , round , full breasts that rose and fell as she brushed her hair . Napier did not look at her , only stared into the brandy snifter . She was desirable and eager , but he was fifty-seven and Victorian and more interested in pouring over Merewether 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled on her shift and curled up in her bed . After another ten minutes , Napier got up , brushed her forehead with his lips , and wandered off toward his own rooms.  | " Whatever happened to le Comte de Bisson ? " asked Paniotti . " Did he manage to establish his holy kingdom in the desert ? " " You know his story , " said Kozika . " You were here . " " It is instructive , " said Paniotti . " I wish our guests to hear it . " " Very well , " said Kozika , touching his fingertips to his forehead as if he were submitting himself to Paniotti 's will . Paniotti , Rassam , Blanc , Abd-ul-Kerim , and Kozika , Paniotti 's agent in Kassala , were sitting cross-legged on the earth floor around Kozika 's low table eating a meal of flat bread , a stew of vegetables and gristly lamb in a common pot , and red wine full of sediment  --  a meal fit for a king , the weary travelers thought . Kozika was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arab and dressed in fez and robes . " That one , that poor misguided fool , " he recalled softly . His voice never rose above a whisper , but he rattled along in Arabic as if he were afraid he would die before he finished . " Such an unfortunate man he was  --  still is , I imagine . Have you heard of him ? " he asked Rassam , and without waiting for a reply he began the story : " Le Comte was a man of sixty years , a Frenchman originally , I think , healthy and handsome and very ambitious for the future . He was an officer in one of the Italian armies , perhaps the Neapolitan , and married a young girl for the sake of her father 's money . With his inheritance in hand , he launched his long-cherished scheme . Ile and his bride came to Kassala last year , before the Nubian mutiny , and they brought along an army of fifty Europeans , the worst rabble he could find in Cairo . ' I have come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ captain of the Egyptian garrison , ' I will turn the Bedouins into good Christians . ' We all tried to reason with him . ' They are already good Moslems , ' we said , ' happy inp184their faith . They are like the will-o ' - the- wisp : you will never see them , or if they choose they will steal upon you unawares and kill you all . ' But he would n't listen . They will fall down before my power , ' he said . They will welcome the true God and acknowledge my rule over them . ' " The saddest thing of all is that he seemed to truly believe that he had a mission to bring the light to the Bedouins . He thought he was doing a worthy thing . " With extravagant promises he recruited a hundred Arabs from Kassala , possibly an even worse rabble than his Europeans . He dressed his Arabs in European uniforms and gave them rifles , which he taught them how to fire . He tried to teach them European drill , but they were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was a wonderful sight when they departed . A gallant Austrian captain , riding a camel and playing a march on his trumpet , led the way . Next came a French officer , de Bisson 's second in command , mounted on a fiery white stallion . Then came the European soldiers , marching in file . Le General le Comte de Bisson and his wife were next , riding side by side on camels and waving at the crowd that had gathered to jeer at them . De Bisson wore a general 's uniform  --  from which army , I do not know  --  and his wife wore the kepi and red uniform of the French Zouave . Last came the Arab soldiers , ridiculous in their ill-fitting uniforms , struggling to keep in step , many with their rifles across the wrong shoulder . " I fear that de Bisson did not very much understand Africa . He was defeated without fighting a single battle , without taking a single Bedouinlife or converting a single heathen soul . The Bedouins of the Barka simply persuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Bisson awoke one morning to find his army shrunk by two-thirds . It was a tragic group that returned to Kassala . Le General wore civilian clothes . He had lost all his Arabs , half his Europeans , and all of his pride . The handsome Austrian captain had died of a fever , the French second in command of the bite of a horned viper . Only the wife was smiling as they entered the city . She had had a wonderful adventure , and she waved to the crowd just as she had on their departure . " De Bisson tried to collect damages from the Egyptian government . I do n't know what charges he made against them . They laughed at him . He and his lady left for Europe , leaving behind those of their Europeans who were still alive . Some of them are still here , with nowhere to go . They might have fought during the Nubian mutiny , the first soldiering they would have done in Africa , but most of them just hid until the fighting was over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is nowhere else for them to go . They wander the streets , waiting , I suppose , to die . It is a sad story , very sad . " The only route from Massawa to Ethiopia that slid not cross rebellious Ethiopian territories went generally westward along the southern boundary of the Egyptian Pashalik of the Sudan , then southeastward up-.  |p185into  Amhara . The caravan had taken twenty-two days to cover the 245 miles from Massawa to Kassala . Often they had set out across country where even their local guides could n't find the caravan tracks . They had traversed the ranges of Bedouins who spoke pure Yemenese Arabic , and the lands of black nomads , where they had to sleep in shifts in order to guard their camels . They had crossed sandy deserts and hilly districts and valleys choked with tropical forests . And always there had been the vaguest hint of mountains just over the horizon to their left , to the South , toward Ethiopia . Paniotti had decided to accompany them as far as the route lay inside Ottoman territory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after his business interests , he said , but the usual hidden motives were lurking close behind . He came reluctantly , as if he had been ordered against his will to see that they reached Ethiopia safely . He was often sullen , and he volunteered even less information than before . Abd-ul-Kerim had appeared suddenly on the third day from Massawa . He , too , would go as far as the limits of Ottoman control . He had some new , mysterious connection with Paniotti , but he would n't talk about it , and Rassam was afraid to press him . Otherwise , the young Arab was as lively and happy as ever . The caravan had started out with thirty camels and fifty mules loaded high with supplies , equipment , and the bulging packages that were the chandeliers and other gifts for Theodore . A hundred porters and servantsaccompanied them . Dahon was among them , but not Rafaelo , since the Goan had conveniently sprained his back on the day before departure . The camels had been hired for a certain distance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves , Rassam and Blanc would have been stranded , but Paniotti 's influence was visible everywhere along the road . They never understood the reason for his accompanying them , but Rassam knew they could n't have made it without him . Rassam suffered from the sparse diet and the constant riding , from the daily thunderstorms , from the severe heat of day and the bitter cold of night , and he soon contracted a fever . He was n't able to hide his pain , but he had too much pride to do less than his share . Abd-ul-Kerim and I'aiiiotti offered to stand his watch at sentry . He refused , but one of them always went with him to watch over him and keep him company . On one incredibly hot day , he finally let Abd-ul-Kerim talk him out of his solar helmet and collar and traveling suit , and into a turban and loose robe . He was amazed at how much cooler he was in his new , but very familiar , clothes . Paniotti was an experienced caravaner , and he simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he did the work that had to be done and rested when the sun grew too hot ; at night he rolled himself quickly into his rug and did n't stir until ( lawn . Abd-ul-Kerim followed the Greek 's lead iii all things , and he seemed h , ; et along as comfortably as in Massawa . Surprisingly , it was Blanc who thrived . The instant he had realizedp186there was no gentlemanly way of getting out of this journey " into the very teeth of death itself , " he had been perfectly reconciled to it . Each day , eager for new adventures , he rose long before anyone else . At noontime , even the Bedouins would lie panting in the shade , but Blanc seemed impervious to the heat . Wearing his thick traveling suit , his patent leather shoes slipping on rocks and filling up with sand , sweat pouring off his nose and his chin , he walked endless miles through the brush . He always came back with game to supplement their diet , or , if it were too large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanc was an excellent backwoods doctor , too , considering his limitedmedical knowledge and the few medicines he had brought . He treated everyone , and though it was the end of the fever season , not a single man died during the entire twenty-two days . He even realized , finally , that some people will never learn English or French , and he began to form an adequate Arabic vocabulary . Arabic had been a constant presence in Aden and Massawa . Though he had never paid any attention to it , much of it had penetrated and remained floating close beneath the surface , only waiting for some concentration to turn it into language . He would practice with Rassam and Abd-ul-Kerim and Paniotti until they would have nothing more to do with him , and then  --  the thing that shocked Rassam most of all  --  he would talk with the servants and the Bedouins . They sent messengers ahead to announce their approach to Kassala , and Kozika and the whole Egyptian-Albanian garrison came several miles up the road to meet them . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops in the Sudan , but the travelers were n't prepared for the desolation they encountered in the last two days before Kassala . The fields had never been prosperous , but now they were deserted and burnt , and the mud houses stood open to the gusting wind and sand . The inhabitants of Kassala who remained walked silently , listlessly , through the streets . Among them were a few ragged Europeans who looked up in quick interest as the caravan entered the city , then continuedwalking . " Great sickness in the city after the mutiny , " Kozika had explained . Of all the people in Kassala , only Kozika and the garrison still looked well fed . " The Nubian troops had not been paid for two years , and they requested a portion of what was due them . The Egyptians only laughed . They have a cruel sense of humor in these parts . So , in July , the Nubians rose in the night and killed their officers . A few Egyptians managed to hold the arsenal until the Egyptian and Albanian soldiers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . More than a thousand Nubians were killed in the fighting , and another thousand were capturedand executed . Those who escaped fled into the desert , and their eternal enemies the Bedouins tracked them clown and killed them . Very bloody business . With unburied bodies all over Kassala , the dis/eases started . The people of the city who had not been killed in the fighting died of the sicknesses , or they ran away . It was once a great city , a very beautiful city , with gardens and children and laughing people . I am sorry you were n't able to see it as it was , my friends . " " Will the city be reinhabited , do you think ? " asked Rassam . " As always , " laughed Kozika . " With any luck at all , with better people than before . I 'll just sit here and wait and do business , and the city will grow around me . " " Will we be able to get fresh camels ? " asked Paniotti . " It will be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only ones alive who still own camels . They have had a great deal of bloodsportrecently , and now that there are soldiers in Kassala again , they are afraid to come too near . But . . . we shall see whether there are any beasts to be had . " With Paniotti 's help they got fresh camels and Bedouin riders . They continued their journey , striking almost due south from Kassala toward Metemma , the village that straddled the traditional border of Ethiopia . Two days out of Kassala , the fever hit Rassam even harder than before . For a few days , he rode a mule instead of a camel , because it was a shorter fall from a mule , but soon even that was too much for him . His head swam , his vision blurred , his body ached , and he could n't concentrate on keeping his seat . Paniotti hung a hammock on a pole and beat the bearers with a stick until they took up the ends and carried Rassam . Blanc and Paniotti walked on either side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but when Rassam was swallowed up in his delirium and shouted that he wanted to be left behind to die in peace , it was Paniotti who held him tight in the hammock and told him in a voice that sliced through the haze , " You 're going on , Mr. Rassam . You 've come this far , there 's too much depending on your going on now , and you will go on . " Rassam was riding again by the time the caravan reached Metemma . Behind them lay the deadly flat plain of the Sudan , but beyond Metemma to the south and the east began the ridges that terraced into the Ethiopian highlands . Metemma , situated on low ground with a stagnant stream running through the middle of the village , was an unhealthy place . They sent a messenger ahead to announce their arrival . While they waited in Metemma , Blanc was swamped with pleas for medicine . He dispensed and treated so many that he was afraid he would run out of supplies before they even crossed the stream into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rassam and refused to see anyone else . On Christmas l ) ay , their messengers returned from the highlands with greetings from Theodore , and with instructions from the emperor to Sheik Jununa of Metenuna , who officially recognized both the Ethiopianmonarch and the Egyptian pasha , to provide them with camelsp188to Wochnee , a village a few days farther up into Ethiopia . According to the message , Theodore would send down a few people to meet them in Wochnee . That night , while Blanc and Abd-ul-Kerim led their Moslem and pagan camelteers in a ragged multilingual riot of Christmas carols , Rassam found Paniotti alone in his tent . Paniotti looked up from where he lay and said , a little sadly , " I was expecting you to come . " They walked slowly along the Sudanese bank of the stream until the fires were a dull glow in the distance and the singing just a hoarse whisper . Rassam 's next-to-last pair of shoes had given out in Kassala . He was saving the last pair for his meeting with the emperor , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet had toughened so much he did n't notice the gravel that gathered between foot and leather . His fever was gone , too , and he was beginning to sense a new , unfamiliar strength growing inside him , a confidence that he could survive anything . Rassam squatted comfortably , Bedouin-style , on the bank . Paniotti turned his slender back to Rassam and looked across the stream . Moonlighttraced Ethiopia 's upward curve in silver . At last he said , questioningly , " Yes ? " He filled that one syllable with a wealth of implications : anxiety , suspicion , defeat . During the whole journey , he had acted as if he was accompanying Rassam against his will , but at least he had been civil . In the last few weeks , ever since the first Ethiopian ridge appeared hard against the horizon of the flat Moslem plain , he had withdrawn into himself . When the rest of the company celebrated the messengers ' return , Paniotti had brooded alone in his tent . Rassam let a handful of sand pour in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what to say to this unfamiliar Paniotti . " You came to me , " the Greek accused him . " Speak . " " I thought we should talk , " started Rassam . " I wanted to ask you certain questions . " " Ask . " " I thought perhaps you might have something to say ... " " Parting thoughts ? Encouragement in your mission ? Best wishes for the emperor ? " Coming from the emotionless Paniotti , the sudden harshness was like a curtain parting around a sick bed to reveal him feeble and helpless . His thick lenses had always been a wall between him and the world , a source of strength , but now they were just to help his weak eyes see . Rassam had never noticed before how fragile his body really was , how the fluttering of his hands was really a sign of fear . " Why did you come with us ? " asked Rassam . " To protect me ? To make sure I reach Ethiopia ? Why do n't you want us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Why have n't you asked before ? " asked Paniotti . " You would n't have answered . "  | " And you think I 'll answer now ? " " I think so . " Rassam stood up to face Paniotti . Somehow Paniotti had seemed so small that Rassam expected to tower over him , but they were exactly the same height . He stared into the gray shadows of Paniotti 's face until Paniotti turned away and looked up at Ethiopia again . " You are more perceptive than before , " Paniotti muttered . " You said once that you worry about what the emperor will do if I come to him , " said Rassam . " Maybe if you explain yourself to me , I 'll be able to share some of your worry , take greater care with him . You said long ago that I bring ruin to him . Maybe I can protect him , if I have some idea of what ruin I can possibly bring . . . " Rassam had spoken quickly , but his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew about either Paniotti or the emperor , and as he rememberedfor the first time in several months what he might face in Ethiopia . Still gazing up at Ethiopia , Paniotti said , " I never cease to marvel at a government that sends out envoys who know absolutely nothing about their destinations . With the roles reversed , what would your Viscount Palmerston and your Mr. Disraeli think of an ambassador to England who had never heard of Wellington and Nelson ? " Paniotti did not wait for an answer . " When you first came to Massawa , you knew nothing of Ethiopia . I fear you know no more now . I was sure you were the wrong man for the mission . Oh , I sent your letters faithfully to the emperor , never fear . But I had my reservations , and I told the emperor my opinions about you . " " You told the emperor ? Your two trips from Massawa ? " Paniotti refused to hear the question . " The only quality you have that recommends you is persistence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed , and stayed . I think you would never leave . " " Never , " said Rassam , too forcefully , and he thought : Go away ? To where ? To what ? Paniotti asked , " What did you learn from the story of Makeda and Menelik ? " Rassam pondered , tried to figure out what Paniotti wanted to hear . Ile finally answered , truthfully , " I learned that the Ethiopians have as superstitious a body of oral literature as any primitive people . Besides that , very little . Wolde told it mostly to get me off my guard , I think , so he could judge me . He had me preoccupied with bringing him back from his fairy tale to reality , and so I was unaware of what he was really doing . " Amazed at Rassam 's stupidity , Paniotti shook his head . " You missed it all , " he said . " To hear that story from Wolde 's lips is an opportunity such as few men have ever had , and it was wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recite the ( ) dyssey . Ethiopians will walk hundreds of miles just to hear Wolde 's voice  --  and all you heard was a fairy tale . "  |p190Rassam  started to speak , but Paniotti turned abruptly and stilled him with an upturned hand . " This Ethiopia , " he said , " is different from anywhere you have ever been . The edges of that Ethiopian plateau mark a different world . Below in the deserts are Negroes and Arabs , paganism and Islam , but in the highlands you find a quick , lively people , Christian for fifteen hundred years . " The Arab who invades the plateau from Massawa or Khartoum or Somaliland complains of the cold and the wet , and his camel freezes in the chill of the mountain nights and dies . The Ethiopian who descends from his plateau succumbs to the fevers , his mule collapses from the heat , and he soon retreats to his mountain home . " This is how it has always been , and always will be . The Prophet of Islam had so much respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . So the Ethiopians , who had fought in Troy and traded with India , have remained alone on their plateau ever since , cut off from the rest of Christendom , surrounded by religious enemies , protected by their mountains . " Think of it , Rassam . To forget for a thousand years that the rest of the world exists ! " But the mountains , at last , proved no protection against the Moslem Gallas , wild tribesmen from Somaliland . More than a hundred years ago , they began to invade Ethiopia . They seized control of the emperor , and so began the Zemene Mesafint , the ' Age of Princes . ' Every man who could command the loyalty of ten others thought he was a feudal lord . The emperor was a figurehead in the hands of the Gallas . It was a time of rape , plunder , death . Moslem and Christian armies destroyed the countryside and killed indiscriminately . " And then there rose a man to put an end to it all . The Emperor Theodore was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a master tactician . He used every bit of luck and leverage and influence wisely , aligned himself skillfully , and when the time was right he swept through the highlands , brought peace to Ethiopia , and had himself crowned emperor . " Paniotti paused , and Rassam said , " Who are you ? " " Only one of the emperor 's faceless men , " said Paniotti , brushing the question aside . " In the beginning , he was a great ruler . In a land that sustains itself on warfare , prophecy , and myth , he was a pacifist and a realist . He is the only patriot Ethiopia has ever known . He was the first Ethiopian leader to pay his armies , so his were the first soldiers who did not have to live by pillaging the countryside . He put an end to the slave trade . He set an example of temperance and piety for his subjects . He observed the fast days like a priest  --  and in Ethiopia there are more than two hundred partial fast days a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of divinity . He was an Alexander . His troops went into battle with Alexander 's battle cry on their lips . " He was flying as high as ' nun ever flew . Ile called himself ' the slavep191of God , ' but he was as close to a human god as ever lived  --  and then it all came tumbling down around his head . Peace gave way to violence . He was in despair . All seemed lost , when Cameron came to him and promised to bring him to the favor of the British Queen . He placed all his hopes on the letter that your government never sent . " He said this last in a bitter , accusatory tone . Rassam only bowed his head . " Now , the rebellions have taken all but the heart of the country . He drinks sometimes  --  not so often as once , but sometimes  --  and he falls into fearful , blind rages . In his rages , he orders killings , and when he awakes and realizes what he has done he scourges himself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden of prophecies that call him , soon , to martyrdom . " Rassam asked , " Is his insanity the reason he imprisoned Consul Cam-eron ? " " Theodore , " said Paniotti , punctuating each slow syllable with a forefingerin Rassam 's chest , " is not insane . This may be difficult for you to understand , but the Emperor Theodore is the only rational man in Ethiopia . " Theodore and his subjects believe in the story of Makeda and Menelik , in the ancient prophecies , in the Voice of the Spirit of Prophecy speaking to men , but these are not simple beliefs . They are reality itself . When you talk about bringing Wolde back from his fairy tale ' to reality , you have lost sight of reality . " The emperor is a man of his people , and these things are as real to him as they are to his subjects ; but he also believes in pragmatic , realisticpolicies to govern Ethiopia as a modern nation . Even now , he never acts without a reason . He is enormously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , Mr. Paniotti , " said Rassam . " I should feel foolish even thinking to ask it , but I must . " " Ask . " " It is the same question I asked Wolde : Is Theodore the Theodore of the prophecy ? " Paniotti moved his hands in a way that implied the question made no sense . " There are prophecies and there are prophecies , " he said . " There are prophecies about Theodore that even Wolde does not know . But I am a merchant , a man of numbers and measures . I deal in cold facts . The fact is that he is a great man , greater by far than anyone you have ever seen . If you meet him , search his face for the marks of that greatness . Treat him with respect and caution . Keep in mind that there are those of us who pray for him to recapture what he had . Remember that he is Ethiopian , not English , nor Arab or Turkish . Take care , liassarn , take care . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the campfires. 11assatn stood for another minute , listening to the singing and the night sounds , less certain than ever about what he was walkingp192toward , until a shuffling across the gravelly sand behind him sent him scurrying after Paniotti . Abd-ul-Kerim wept the next morning when Rassam and Blanc left him and Paniotti behind and started up toward Wochnee . Sheik Jumma of Metemma and most of his subjects waved good-by as the caravan lurched across the stream , and several of the local militia fired off independentsalutes . From the top of the first ridge Rassam turned in his saddle and looked back . The locals had dispersed . Abd-ul-Kerim and Paniotti stood alone now , their heads close together , talking earnestly . Rassam realized that , while Paniotti had made the Emperor Theodore into a nation , Abd-ul-Kerim had made him into a balloon on which to rise and float over all the world . Rassam hoped his young Arab friend would find what he sought in the service of the emperor . Just before they disappeared below the ridge , Abd-ul-Kerim put his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked back toward the encampment . After fifteen months of waiting in Massawa and three months travelingthrough the Sudan , the ascent into Ethiopia seemed to Rassam and Blanc like a journey into a magical kingdom . The path to Wochnee undulated through high , swaying grasses , scattered with thorn trees and baobabs . They encountered the first real cultivation they had seen in two years in Africa ; the villages seemed prosperous and comfortable . The peasants ' cafe-au-bit skin , hooked noses , and dark , wavy hair were like those of the Sudanese Arabs , but , as Paniotti had said , they were a totally different people . They wore the Ethiopian shama and white trousers . Even when they were working in the fields , the men kept their weapons  --  sword or spear , and small round shield  --  within easy reach . They walked with lighter steps and worked with more energy than the lowland peoples . A round , thatch-roofed church perched on nearly every hilltop , and companies of turbanned priests came out to watch the caravan go by . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , accounts of Ethiopian journeys , one by the Scot James Bruce , who had visited Ethiopia in the eighteenth century , and one by the Englishman Mansfield Parkyns , who had made his trip in the 184os . Rassam 's fever had prevented him from reading them before , so he read them now on camel-back . He looked up from his books whenever he came across something interesting and shouted it across to Blanc . The books painted an incredible picture : feasts of raw beef cut from the flanks of living cattle , wars and savagery , wild religious celebrations . Blanc listened politely , but he tended to notice other things . " It does n't seem to be particularly unhealthy , " he said . " There are some of the expected diseases of a primitive place , of course , but just from the way the natives walk , you can tell they 're healthier . ( ) f course ... hand me the Parkyns book , will you ? " He leaned out and took the book from Rassam , thumbed through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as the natives practice , are often highly advantageous ; and firing with a hot iron at their recommendation may also be adopted . For severe inflammation of the bowels , when you can not bear to be touched on the part , some boiling water poured on it will be a ready and effective blister  --  a wet rag being wrapped around in a ring to confine the water within the intended limits . ' " " Please , Dr. Blanc . " Rassam was n't actually turning pale , but he was squirming a little in his saddle . In all his life , Blanc had felt he was a misfit . He saw other people following their own individual pursuits , interests , loves and hates , but he 'd never found anything that could hold his attention for long . He had gone into medicine because it was the family profession , though he had never felt drawn to it . He had entered the army because it was the expected , usual pattern , but he had never felt at home there . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known , wandering alone for long hours in the wilderness , looked to by the others as the source of their health , besieged in villages along the way by people praying for medicines and salvation from the doctor whose fame had preceded his arrival , he felt strangely at home . His medicine took on a new meaning . He applied himself to studying native remedies : he did n't believe in most of them , but for the sake of scientific curiosity he interviewed Ethiopians and recorded their cures in a notebook . He had been forced to walk around barefoot for a few weeks now in order to save his remaining pair of shoes ; it felt perfectly natural . His white complexion had first turned red , then had peeled , and was now a freckled bronze . The food was coarse and the ground at night was hard , but there was never any real lack of anything . His mind and body toughened . He found himself enjoying the company of people in ways that were unfamiliar to him . There were n't any real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mesopotamian was n't nearly as far from being English as he had thought , nor a Greek , nor an Arab , nor even a filthy Bedouin camel driver . He was thriving , and he had never been happier . On the fourth day , the head priest of Wochnee met them at the outskirts of the village , the largest they 'd seen since Kassala . The emperorhad sent word , the priest told them in Amharic through Dahon , that they were to wait in Wochnee , and he would send a small number of ' people to escort them onward , as well as mules , since their camels were useless farther ahead where the terrain got difficult . They pitched their tents among the sycamore trees outside the village . During , the four days they waited , Bassani finished the Ethiopian travel books Kozika had given him , and also shot the elephant for which Blanc had been hoping for more than three months.  |p194It  was a tremendous bull with one tusk snapped off in a jagged mess of ivory splinters . Together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake . Rassam dearly wanted Blanc to have it , but the elephant ran in such a way that there was a dense grove of trees betweenitself and Blanc . Rassam , two hundred yards away from Blanc , fired a wild shot , caught it exactly in the heart , and sent it tumbling down to die . On the morning of the fourth day in Wochnee , the " few people " from the emperor arrived . Dahon saw the escort first and came running to the sycamore grove . " They 're here ! " he cried . " The emperor 's people are here ! " Blanc and Rassam came out of their tents and started toward the trail , but Dahon put himself in their way and said anxiously , " There is something you should know , masters . There are many of them . Very many . Horse and on foot . I did n't know there would be so many . I did n't know you were so important to the emperor . Forgive me . The horsemen will greet you by fakkering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frighten , not to harm , only to greet . Please , do n't be afraid . " Blanc sniffed and went on toward the trail . " Thank you , " said Rassam softly , though he did n't know what Dahon was trying to tell them . " It 's always nice to be prepared . " He had put aside his turban and robe here in Wochnee , and he was wearing his woolen traveling suit and solar helmet . It was still very hot in Wochnee , sweat was dripping down his face , and his feet were dirty-gray in their sandals . He missed the cool softness of his turban , and felt a little ridiculousin this costume without shoes . " Come , " he said to Dahon , " we 'll go and see them . " " There are very many , " repeated Dahon , tagging along at Rassam 's side . " Then the honor will be greater , " said Rassam . The three men positioned themselves where they could see the track coming over the next ridge . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , rumbling , murmuring , like a volcano about to burst , was audible . Rassam turned to Dahon to ask a question , but he saw Blanc standing firm and strong , and he was silent . Facing the unknown with courage , standing aloof from danger , was part of what made Blanc an Englishman . For the first time in several months , Rassam found himself worrying about what Blanc thought of him . He realized , too , that he was afraid of that approaching rumble . The first man appeared . He was riding a short , shaggy horse . He held a small round shield on his left arm , and a naked sword dangled from his right hand . His black hair was long and glistening . Another horseman appeared , and then another , until there were a dozen of them , riding slowly in a loose rank . " Not so many , " whispered Rassam.  |p195Another  dozen appeared . And then the men on foot began to come over the ridge . They were all dressed in the white costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spears over their shoulders . They did n't march in any particular order , but just seemed to follow the horsemen in a general way , overflowing on either side of the caravan track . There were mules among them , some carrying bundles of equipment , some unladen . There were more than a thousand marching men and a hundred mules . " If it is n't a royal welcome , Mr. Rassam , " laughed Blanc , and his laugh sounded perfectly genuine , " then it 's time to break out the last bottle of cognac and drink it quickly . Is n't it ? " Rassam , pale and shaking , did n't answer . " I do n't see any chains among them . Do you ? " Again , Rassam did n't answer . The horsemen began to gallop , their horses ' hooves tossing up brown grass and loose dirt as they raced down the long slope . All the swords were suddenly out , waving in the air . One man screamed , " Alalalalai ! " and the others joined in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dull thunder of the unshod hooves . Blanc felt Rassam starting to faint . " Stand firm , " he cried , and he held tight to Rassam 's arm and held him up . " Let us be a credit to our Queen . " Rassam tried to straighten up , but Blanc still had to support most of his weight . Rassam heard Blanc cry , " God save the Queen ! " The man might bend so far as to talk as an equal to Bedouins , but he never forgot for an instant who he was . The horsemen were fifty yards away now . Their swords were waving like blades of brown grass . Rassam could see the spit fly from the men 's screaming lips , the foam on the horses ' muzzles . The horses pounded toward them , to the point where they should stop , past the point of no return , so close now they had to trample the waiting men . And then they stopped short in a great confusion of hooves and steel and grass and sweat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen . The leader leaped from his saddle and landed two feet in front of them . He was short , powerfully built , and his face was a web of white saber scars . He salaamed briskly with the hilt of his sword and began to speak rapidly in Amharic . " Dahon , " ordered Blanc , and the servant was instantly at his elbow , translating : " This man is Magiga Dulou , very famous . This other man is Gabry . " He indicated a second man who had followed Magiga Dulou forward and was now standing beside him . " They are both generals of the emperor , and Gabry is one of the emperor 's Twelve Disciples . It is a great honor to be met by these men . " " Did Magiga ! Moil say that , or do you say it ? " asked Blanc . " It is what Magiga Dulou said , but it is very true . The Twelve are veryp196great men in this country , very holy and blessed by God . Magiga Dulou says he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you can make yourselves ready this afternoon , then he will be pleased to begin the trip to the emperor 's court . " Just beginning to breath properly again , Rassam asked , " How far are we from the emperor ? " " Twenty days . A very difficult journey . " The men on foot had caught up with the horsemen , and they surroundedRassam and Blanc and Dahon in a tight mass of pushing , talking , pulsing , breathing humanity . Blanc felt himself the core of a thing greater than himself , the focal point of great events that were about to happen . In all the months since he and Rassam had left Aden , this was the first time he had had any sense of the importance of this mission . He looked at Rassam , who had straightened up as if he too sensed their central position and found in it better medicine than Blanc could prescribe for him . What does this all mean to Rassam ? Blanc wondered . The caravan , minus the last Bedouin camelteers but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short stages , mostly because the escort spent so much time getting ready each morning . It turned out that Magiga Dulou spoke very adequate Arabic , but he was a man of no unnecessary words in any language . Rassam asked him why he had made them speak through Dahon on the first morning , and he replied truthfully , " To judge you and your people , as I was told to do . " He was the ideal image of the proud savage : honest , stoic , silent , self-contained , probably cruel and ruthless . Though he spoke only Amharic , Gabry was Magiga Dulou 's complete opposite . He kept Dahon with him all the time they were on the march , and through him he constantly jabbered away to Rassam and Blanc . All the Ethiopians but Magiga Dulou deferred to him as an important man , but it was soon clear to Rassam that he was totally lacking in common sense . Most of Gabry 's talk was about the emperor , his bravery , his wisdom , his generosity . Magiga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near him all the time he was talking to the foreigners , and snarled out a warning in Amharic whenever he thought Gabry was straying onto forbidden ground . In camp on the first night , Dahon disappeared after dinner and did n't reappear until after midnight . Waiting for Dahon to return , Rassam realized how little he knew this man who had been such a devoted servant . Rassam had been expecting Dahon to disappear this way . He wondered what messages from Paniotti he was giving to Magiga Dulou , what intimate information about Rassam and Blanc . Word of their coming preceded them , and in each village crowds of peasants and priests swarmed around Blanc shouting , " Medan He , abeit , medanite . " " Medicine , lord , medicine . " Blanc tried to help as many asp197he could , writing down descriptions of the various illnesses he found here , observing to Rassam again and again that the general level of health was improving as they gained altitude , but before too many days had passed he had to resume his old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up camp . Magiga Dulou instructed the soldiers to keep the peasants away from Blanc , and after that it was only the important men of each district who were allowed access to the doctor and his medicines . On the seventeenth day , they emerged through a high , narrow pass and saw the plateau below , stretching out to the horizon , dotted with freestanding ambas and round lakes , still rising gently toward the east but now , suddenly , a true tableland . In the center of it all lay Lake Tana . In the tone of a teacher explainingsomething to an ignorant student , Gabry pointed out the Ghish Abai , the swamp south of the lake from which the Little Abai River flowed in a dark ribbon into the lake , and the place several miles farther to the east where the Abai , or Blue Nile , flowed out of the lake in a broad band toward the southeast , cut into the plateau in a winding , widening gash , and began its great swing to the south and then to the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south bank of the lake between the two rivers ; and Theodore had expected to be encamped there by the time their party reached the plateau . Magiga Dulou sent messengers ahead that night , and throughout the next day messengers were constantly leaving for the emperor 's camp or returning from it . As the brief highland twilight descended , they pitched their tents on a hilltop overlooking a stream of clear , cold water . A dozen scrawny cattle were waiting for them by the stream . " A gift from the emperor to his welcome guests , " Gabry explained . The soldiersdid n't cut steaks from the flanks of the living cows , as Mansfield I'arkyns had reported they would , but they did butcher the cows and eat the flesh raw . Dahon roasted a huge portion , and the envoy and the doctor ate well , if a little queasily . On a hilltop in the distance , perhaps two miles away , they could just make out a large red pavilion surrounded by smaller white tents . As night came on , they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time it had grown dark a vast glow had spread over the surrounding landscape . " It will be tomorrow , " said Rassam . " At last , it will be tomorrow . " " I wonder what he 'll be like , " said Blanc . " We shall have to have our wits about us . " " Yes , " answered Rassam , " we shall . "  |p199Rassam  put on his blue " diplomatic suit , " Blanc his scarlet officer 's uniform . Rassam tugged on stockings and squeezed his feet into his shoes . When he stood , his feet spread out as if they were still in sandals , and they hurt until he mounted his horse and took his weight off them . Magiga Dulou and Gabry led the way , Dahon rode just behind Rassam and Blanc , and their escort , swollen during the night to a noisy mob of three thousand men , followed . As they forded the stream that ran at the foot of their hill , Gabry pointed out a black-and-white falcon that was perched high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , blinked , ruffled its shoulderfeathers , and was still . Magiga Dulou explained in Arabic , " It is the gaddy-gaddy , an importantomen for travelers . Watch him as we go by . If he flies away , he predicts ill for your journey . If he stays and watches , he predicts well . " Rassam was n't a superstitious man , but deep down , against his will , he needed the omen to be real , and he needed the falcon to stay . I , coking back , he saw the huge mass of men and mules and horses , jostling , shouting , spreading out to make elbowroom for themselves . They passed under and around the mimosa . Dust swirled high , water splashed , and the tree shook as a mule bumped against it . The falcon swayed on its slender branch . It lifted its wings , fluttered t hem for balance . Rassam raised his bridle hand toward the bird and whispered , " Stay . " The falcon lifted its wings again , but its talons clung light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dulou in Arabic , then leaned toward Gabry and said it again in Amharic . " I 'll choose to beliewv this omen , " said Blanc lightly.  |p200Gabry  opened a saddlebag and took out a thick falconer 's gauntlet and a lure . He wheeled his horse away from the column and up . At the top of the hill , he swung the lure and whistled quickly , three times , then three more . Stiff-winged , the falcon glided in over Rassam 's head , circledthe contour of the hill , came back into view as it rose up beyond it , towered high over Gabry , and stooped to the lure . Gabry tugged it in , and came riding down the hill with the hooded falcon on his gauntlet . He was grinning proudly . " That 's all it was ? " said Rassam , disappointed . " Just a trick ? " Magiga Dulou looked at him curiously , not understanding . " It was a favorable omen . The gaddy-gaddy stayed . " " It was n't a real omen , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Magiga Dulou . " See . " He reached out and stroked the bird on Gabry 's fist . " Gabry made it stay . " " The gaddy-gaddy is real . It stayed . The omen is good . " " An omen ca n't work if it 's planned ahead of time . It does n't work if you manipulate it and make it happen . " " That 's a curious thought , " said Magiga Dulou . " Is that the way with omens in your country ? " The column had stopped while Gabry rode to the top of the hill . The horses had milled around , and Rassam looked past Magiga Dulou into Blanc 's smiling face . His Arabic might not have been good enough yet for him to catch every word , but he was able to understand the gist . He was laughing softly , listening for Rassam 's reply . " Well , we do n't actually place much faith in omens in our country , " Rassam said . " But it is n't logical for a man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still predict the future . " " What is n't logical about it ? " asked Magiga Dulou . " I ca n't explain , " said Rassam , knowing he was defeated . " It just does n't seem logical to me . " " It seems perfectly logical to me , " said Magiga Dulou . Then , politely , " I ca n't explain , either . " They started again . The path they took kept to the low , marshy ground between the hills , even when it might have been faster to take a higher route . There were signs of abandoned campsites everywhere , but not a single tent or horse or human being . The reason for picking this way soon became clear . They could never see farther than the next hilltop , so they were becoming disoriented . Rassam was reminded of the short , deliberate wait they had had in the dim anteroom to the sheik 's kat room . They were being prepared for some sort of impressive display . Knowing what was being done to him did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tension rising . At last , Magiga Dulou turned from the valley bottom and led them up a broad , gentle ridge . As they Caine up to the sununit , Magiga I ) ulou slowed their pace to less than u walk . They moved forward two feet ,  |p201then  paused , then moved forward three , then paused . The silver-andcrimsonlion pennant appeared first , high up , fluttering all alone in the amazing blue of the highland sky . Then the red pavilion appeared . It was still half a mile away , but from here they could see that its diameter was at least fifty yards . The entire front was open . As they moved onto the crest of the ridge , the slope below the pavilioncame slowly into view . A patchwork quilt of carpets , as wide as the pavilion itself , led down to the base of the hill . The hill and the valley bottom between were covered with a solid mass of humanity . Ethiopian soldiers were everywhere but on the avenue of carpets ; not a single toe touched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through what must have been ten thousand mounted warriors to the base of the emperor 's hill , where a tent of yellow silk had been pitched . A silk Union Jack , with slightly off-color reds and blues , hung above the yellow tent . The sun had cleared the tops of the hills , and shone directly down into the valley . The body heat from thousands of men and horses , the stench of so many animals , was a solid mist surrounding Rassam and Blanc as they started through the alley . The warriors ' horses were adorned with richly decorated bridles , and many of the warriors held shields encased in solid silver . They wore their hair in long buttered braids , like Magiga Dulou , Gabry , and the rest of their escort . The butter had flowed in long streaks down their bodies . The ten thousand horsemen raised their spears and swords and flintlocks . They began to shout , " Alalalalai ! " and banged their weapons against their shields . High-pitched women 's voices began to warble somewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the narrower it seemed to be , the tighter the horsemen seemed to press in on him , the louder the noise became . His senses were having trouble finding any kind of anchor . He clung to his horse , letting it find its own way . The piercing yellow of the tent finally rose in front of them . In the wide empty space around it , Rassam felt less claustrophobic and got himself under better control . Magiga Dulou helped him down from his horse and led him into the pavilion . Someone let the tent flaps fall . The shouting outside ended in an instant , and silence echoed harshly through the valley . Rassam walked over beautiful Oriental rugs . The sun shining through the yellow silk imparted a yellow glow to every-t king . Three men were waiting inside the tent . One was a tall warrior , dressed more simply than any of the thousands of soldiers outside . Something about his bearing gave him an aura of power and grace , and made his simple clothes more impressive than the finest garments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Blanc . " I anm Mauro , the emperor 's chamberlain . I am of the Twelve . " Though they had to wait for 1 ) ahon 's translation to understand the words , it wasp202clear that this man had spent years training his voice to match his station . Rassam salaamed as deeply as Mamo , and found that his hands were shaking . " I am honored to meet another of the famous Twelve of the Emperor Theodore , " he said . " I am Mr. Hormuzd Rassam , Envoy of Her Majesty Queen Victoria , and this is Dr. Henry Blanc of the British army . " " By the power of God , I hope you are well , " said Mamo . " And you also , Dr. Blanc . " " Yes , I am well . " " Very . I hope you are well , also . " " I am , thanks be to God most high , " said Mamo through Dahon . " This is Samuel . " He indicated a spry , elderly Ethiopian who stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emperor . The emperor has made him your balderaba , your announcer and servant for the time you are in our country . " Dahon gasped with surprise before he translated , and when he had finished repeating Mamo 's words in Arabic , he said quickly , " You cannotknow what an honor this is . " " What is a balderaba ? " asked Rassam . " The balderaba is an Ethiopian custom , " said Dahon . " A host offers one of his own servants to an honored guest . The servant , the balderaba , becomes the man of the guest . He announces him on formal occasions , serves him all the time . For the emperor to give you Samuel as balderaba  --  it is too great an honor . I had no idea . Samuel has been the emperor 's personal , closest servant for ten years . " Rassam had always known that Dahon was more than the simple servant he seemed . It had been too easy for Abd-ul-Kerim to find an Amharic-speaking servant in Massawa . His talks with Paniotti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night had confirmed the suspicion . Still , Dahon had always been an excellent servant , perfectly loyal , and Rassam had overlooked his being a spy . Now , certainly , it was obvious by his tone of voice that he was to be trusted in this matter : Dahon was indeed surprised , and being given Samuel as balderaba was a tremendous honor . " I am overjoyed , " said Rassam . " I thank the emperor . " " And this is Wolde , " said Mamo . " The emperor 's personal priest . He also is of the Twelve . " This was said in a perfectly serious tone , without a hint of the absurdity of introducing Wolde to Rassam . Wolde stepped closer . " By the death of Christ , I am happy you have made your journey safely , " he said in Arabic . " Are you very well ? " " Very well , " said Rassam . " I am pleased to see you again . " " And I you . " " The emperor will see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First , he desires that you should eat and drink and rest . " ' l'hey sat in a circle on cushions on the floor , except for Samuel andp203Dahon , who crouched against the wall of the tent and whispered together . Other servants , on a signal from Mamo , brought flat loaves of coarse bread , dishes of a paste with pieces of beef mixed in it , and glasses of milky liquor . The paste was peppery to the taste of the Britishers , almost too spicy to eat , but the liquor , which Mamo explained was the famous tej , was faintly reminiscent of honey and very soothing . The conversation during the meal fell into a pattern that was quickly becoming familiar in Ethiopia . Mamo and Wolde requested the minutestdetails as to the well-being of Rassam and Blanc , and discussed Rassam 's fever at great length . Obviously , health was a matter of great concern to the Ethiopians , as well as being an innocuous topic of discussion . At last , the meal over , they were left alone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Samuel told them , " I am pleased to be balderaba to the envoys of the British Queen . We have been waiting for you for a very long time . By the Immaculate Conception , I will do whatever you ask , for I am now your servant . " " When will we see the emperor ? " asked Rassam . " Soon . Very soon . He only desires that you should be made comfortablebefore coming to see him . " Rassam was eager to ask Samuel about the captives , about Theodore 's disposition , about anything Samuel could tell them , but he knew he would n't believe answers from the emperor 's personal servant , and he was sure Samuel would instantly report everything he said to Theodore . " That will be all for now , " he said , though he did not know what tone of voice one used with one 's balderaba . Samuel nodded and started toward the tent flap , then turned and said over his shoulder , in slow , unsteady Arabic , " A balderaba in Ethiopia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's man ; now I am yours . I have no ties to him anymore . If you wish to know anything , I will tell you gladly . Such is my sacred duty . " Rassam only looked at him . Samuel seemed so sincere that Rassam wanted to trust him , but he could n't be sure . He was starting to feel dizzy . The yellow that permeated everything inside the tent was too strong ; the smell and sound from outside leaked through the silk walls , and the pressure of that slow ride through the alley of horsemen was still too recent . He did n't say anything. " 1 shall be near , " Samuel said . He slipped out and the tent flap fell behind him . Rassam lay on his back on the carpets and pulled a cushion under his head . Even through his eyelids he could see that intense yellow . He worked at regaining control of himself . Across from him Blanc leaned against cushions and watched him . Rassam 's anxiety was obvious . It was true that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Rassam did , Blanc thought , but even for a timid Haut this moment should n't hold such depths of terror . There must he more to it all in Rassam'sp204mind than was apparent on the surface  --  and if those hidden anxieties were ruling Rassam at the thought of approaching a heathen king , then what would happen to the mission , to Blanc , to the captive consul and missionaries , if Rassam were in command during a real emergency ? After a while , Rassam seemed to regain some control over himself . He sat up , neatened his collar , and smoothed down his hair . Just to fill the gap , Blanc started rambling . " Have you ever noticed how professional people try to make themselves more impressive than they really are by separating themselves from other people ? I do n't mean separating in a social sense , though they certainly do that , too . I mean in a physical sense . " A judge does n't enter a courtroom by the same door everyone else does . To get to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layers of people . They always have someone else to greet you . Often you have to talk to two or three people before you actually are admitted into the presence . " They may not know exactly what they are doing , but they have set up their physical surroundings in such a way that it removes them from their clients . That makes them seem more important , less human , when you finally do get through to them . " That 's what the emperor is doing here . The stage management of all this day is too perfect to be unintentional . Look at all the layers we 've come through : Waiting in Metemma . Waiting in Wochnee . Gabry and Magiga Dulou and their escort . Waiting that last night within sight of the red pavilion . The new escort this morning . Passing through all those ranks of men on horses . Meeting the next layer of the emperor 's ministers , Mamo , Wolde . Waiting here in this tent . " Layers . Many , many layers . There are sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get all the way through to him at all . He may be a savage and a heathen , but I have to hand it to him : he understands the theory of layers . He is an excellent stage manager . " " You may be right , " said Rassam . He still felt weak , though his strength was returning slowly . " Of course I 'm right , " said Blanc . " Now , I wonder when we 'll be admitted to the presence ? " The time of their audience was announced by a slowly swelling clamor from the hordes surrounding their tent . Samuel appeared and said , " Your escort is coming in state down the hill . Do you need anything to prepare yourselves ? Can I bring you anything ? " " We are perfectly ready , " said Rassam . " Have been for months , " Blanc muttered in English . Samuel threw open the flaps of the yellow tent , and on the crest of rippling cheers an escort of four  --  Magiga Dulou , Gabry , Wolde , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Blanc . The Britishoarsbrushed off their suits for the lust time and stepped into the brilliantp205sunshine . The men of their escort were mounted on flawless white horses . " A sign of highest honor , " Dahon whispered to Rassam , " to them and to you . " They had brought two more perfect horses with them . Rassam and Blanc stepped onto their low mounts . Dahon and Samuel got onto mules . The long wait in the hot sun had only intensified the excitement of the massed army that covered the valley and the hill . Their thousands of polished metal weapons were raised high above their heads , and the sun , now shining straight down , turned them into a million mirrored surfaces . When they reached the carpets , they dismounted and began to walk uphill . Here , finally , there was plenty of elbow room . Laid directly on the tall grass , the carpets sunk down under each step . The hill was steep and the surface of the carpets made the climb exhausting . " Just another layer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion 's courage up , " just another layer . " The top of the hill was perfectly flat , like a miniature amba . The scarlet pavilion had been pitched in its exact center . The Ethiopian escort stopped at the point where the slope leveled off . Rassam and Blanc waited with them . " It is part of the ritual of an audience with the emperor , " Samuel told Rassam . " To wait within his sight for his signal to approach . " " How long will we have to wait ? " asked Blanc , leaning toward Samuel . Blanc was afraid that Rassam would n't last if they had to stand here for long . " An hour , " said Samuel . " Maybe more , maybe less . The greater the honor of the guest , the shorter the wait . We can only wait and see . " He turned and looked back toward their yellow tent . " The gifts you brought for the emperor are being brought up , " he said . " It will be proper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A group of warriors were carrying the crates , still unopened , marked with penciled descriptions of the contents , up the hill . They were not nearly as efficient in their carrying as porters in Massawa would have been , Rassam noted , because they had to carry their shields and spears as well as the crates . It was inefficient , but that was the basic difference between there and here . There were no slaves in Ethiopia . Every man was a warrior . The men set the crates down behind Rassam and Blanc , then sat on them and waited . The pavilion , as they were now able to see more clearly , was a great square tent with a peaked roof , large enough for a hundred men to sit in comfort . A long awning extended toward them . Under the awning , room for twice as many . The interior of the pavilion was so dark that they could not see into it . A warrior was standing at the very edge of the open side , looking steadily into the pavilion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive a signal from inside . He turned and raised his hand . A band of soldiers just down the hill fired off a clean , resonating salute with their flintlocks , and every other musket in the valley cracked off a ragged shot . A cloud of brimstone engulfed the hill , and in an instant there was no sound at all except for the echo of the shots . Samuel took the lead across the carpets under the awning . Rassam and Blanc followed , and Dahon and the four Ethiopians came behind . They walked the length of the awning and then stopped before enteringthe pavilion itself . Within the shadowed interior , nine white-clothed men , each holding two double-barreled pistols , stood in a line against the far wall , fifty yards away . In the middle of their line the emperor sat on a low wooden platform . He wore a voluminous white robe , bordered with a wide scarlet band . The robe hung down around the platform , covered his hands , and extended up past his chin , so all they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his mouth and one bare foot that hung down from the platform . To one side of his platform , two silver kettledrums rested on the carpet . The warrior closest to him had a double-barreled pistol in one hand , and with the other held a parasol over the emperor 's head . Samuel indicated with a movement of his hand that the others should wait for him , and he swept forward and prostrated himself on the carpets , crawled the last ten feet , kissed the outstretched imperial toe , and then retreated back to Rassam and Blanc . He faced the emperor and made his announcement in a loud , formal tone across those fifty yards of carpet . He spoke for five minutes or more , but Dahon , clearly as awed as Rassam , did not dare to translate for his masters . After the announcement , the emperor leaned slightly to one side and , without looking in that direction , spoke in a low voice . The officer to that side came forward and whispered to Samuel , who in turn relayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Emperor Theodore wishes you welcome . He asks if you are well , and if you have had a difficult journey to come here . He wishes me to say also that he desires to honor you , in the manner of our country . If strict protocol were to be followed , it would be necessary for you to crawl to him and kiss his toe before you would be allowed to enter his presence . He does not wish to impose such a ritual on you , as he knows it runs contrary to your custom , so he will conduct the audience from this distance . " Rassam was nearly overwhelmed by the deliberate presentation . Just as Blanc had suggested , the emperor 's costume detached him from the realm of mankind , and the extra distance imposed between them by this relaying of the words was equally awe-inspiring . Rassam found himself thinking in contradictions . The vast army of warriors . The solid row of heavily armed , ruthless officers . The barbarism of the whole display . The Oriental splendor . The isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ audience , but a chance to look **32;8622;TOOLONG . Knowing what was being done to him , how the illusion was being created , did nothing to lessen the visual effect it produced . " We are well , " he said dryly . The little speech he had prepared months before and practiced a thousand times came out by itself . " The journey was long and difficult , but we have been sustained by the hope of meeting such a wise and famous Christian monarch as the Emperor Theodore of the Ethiopians . I bring a letter from Her Majesty Victoria , Queen of Great Britain and Ireland , to Your Majesty . " He handed the Queen 's letter to Samuel . The moment the precious document left his fingers , it seemed as if an electrical impulse was trying to draw it back into his hand , but Samuel had the letter and was translatingRassam 's words into Amharic for the officer . The officer listened carefully , then took the letter and the words to Theodore . The emperor indicated with a subtle nod of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drums . He spoke again to the officer , who spoke to Samuel , and Samuel told them , " The emperor asks you to be seated . It is a very great honor . " Servants brought wooden stools , and they sat on them where they had stood , still fifty yards from the emperor . The conversation went on for nearly an hour in the same tedious vein , the words passing from Theodoreto the officer to Samuel to Rassam , and then back through the same roundabout route . This process obviously strained out much of the meaning of what was being said , and it made any real conversation impossible  --  which was exactly what was intended . " I am very happy to see that my British friends have arrived safely , " said the emperor . " I have long anticipated the pleasure of seeing you . " " We have anticipated the chance to see Your Majesty . " Compliments and the usual questions about each other 's health becamethe topics of conversation , until Theodore abruptly changed directionand said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their-lames were John Bell and Walter Plowden . Were they known to you ? " Rassam answered , " Their names are known , but I did not know them personally . " " They were very good men . They helped me to build roads and bridges , and they told me they could make me a friend of the British Queen , who loves all Christians everywhere in the world . This made me very happy . But it was the will of God that they should be killed . " The Consul Cameron came to me later , and I was very pleased , for I thought he could make me a friend of the British Queen . But he het rayed me . Ile went clown to my enemies the Turks , and he did not deliver my letter to the Queen . This Consul Cameron is not my friend , he is my enemy . Now that you have come to be my friends , I hope you can make me a friend of your British Queen . " Long ago , Bassani had decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in regard to Cameron . " It was unfortunate that you came to doubt the friendship of the Queen , " said Rassam . " When you have read the letter I have brought , you will see that she is most eager to be your friend . " " I am eager to be her friend , also . " " I can assure Your Majesty that nothing is dearer to the hopes of our Queen than to be your friend . " " I hope all will be well between our countries again . " " I am sure it will . In hopes of showing my goodwill to you , and the goodwill of our Queen , I have taken the liberty of bringing a few small presents to you . " " Are these gifts from you , or are they from your Queen ? " asked Theodore . " I chose them at the instructions of my Queen . " The emperor nodded slightly . " Then I shall be pleased to accept them . " The warriors who had carried the crates up the hill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought each present in turn to him for his inspection , than laid them out in front of him . They made a quite impressive display . The emperor sent back formal thanks after each item , but the distance was so great and the process of translation destroyedso much meaning , that Rassam could n't tell whether the gifts had made any impression on Theodore at all . After more formal compliments and mutual assurances of goodwill , Theodore told them , " After your long journey , you are surely tired . You may go now , and I will speak to you tomorrow . " They remounted their horses , and their escort led them past the yellow tent and around the hill . " The emperor has selected another site for your tent , " Samuel explained . As they rode through the valleys , with Ethiopian soldiers running along beside them , scrambling up above them for a better look , Blanc pulled his horse close beside Rassam 's and said in English , " When the presents were opened , I thought his eyes would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I mean that he appeared to me the typical savage , " said Blanc . " Despite all the artificial display . If you understand about layers andlook at him objectively , he seemed just like a child at Christmas . " " From that distance you could see so much ? " asked Rassam . " Clearly . " " I thought he was most dignified . " " Dignified ? " asked Blanc . " Never . Just like a child . " Rassam wondered how he and Blanc could have such widely divergentviews of what they had seen . He was still feeling an intense emotionalresponse to the emperor 's manner , to the setting , to the religious aura around him . Blanc seemed to have seen exactly what he planned to see.  | " I think the idea of threatening him with British might is still the best , " said Blanc . " He should respond to that . " " I shall treat him like a sovereign , " said Rassam . Rassam awoke to an insistent hand on his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Master Rassam , Master Rassam . " Rassam only murmured . " The emperor is waiting for you . " Rassam opened his grainy eyes . It was still dark , but Samuel had brought into the tent a low-burning lamp that cast his face in weird , warm colors . " Come quickly . He waits . " " Now ? " " Yes , now . Dress quickly . " Dr. Blanc as well ? " " No , just Master Rassam . Come quickly . " Rassam rubbed cold water into his face , pulled on his diplomatic suit and his shoes , and followed Samuel into the black , dewy night . Rassam and Blanc had been given a huge white silk tent that was pitched on a hilltop facing the emperor 's compound  --  the red pavilion , it had turned out , was only a ceremonial tent and not really the emperor'sliving quarters . The emperor 's compound consisted of his own great sky-blue tent , and another twenty tents of various colors and sizes that housed close ministers and their concubines , offices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide surrounded the emperor 's tents , and a similar empty strip surrounded the tent of the Britishers and the smaller tent shared by Dahon and Samuel . A winding journey of several miles had led them from Theodore 's ceremonial pavilion to their own tent . It immediately became apparent that the soldiers who had greeted them had not constituted the whole army , but were merely a small honor guard . Thousands more flocked to watch them pass as they moved through the camp , and then the realization that this was not just an army , but a complete city , struck t hem . There were not only soldiers , but old people , women , and children . Thousands upon thousands of dark-skinned , naked children screamed and pushed for a look at the feringi . An escort of mounted warriors hovered close around Rassam and Blanc , but the children still swarmed underfoot like locusts and cut their progress to a crawl . In the evening , endless lines of women passed on their way to fetch water from the many streams that ran through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked women , wearing flowing robes of white muslin or Manchester calico . Their feet and hands were darkened with henna , and their eyes were rimmed with black antimony . Many had blue crosses tattooed on their foreheads and hare arms . Silver anklets jingled as they walked . As they looked up at the feringi on the hill , their glances were bold , curious , intelligent . ' They chanted atonally ,  |p210but  in time with some silent rhythm they all shared . Rassam found their voices strange , but appealing . It was not long before cooking odors began to fill the air , and late into the night music , shouts , and laughter floated across the hilltops . Rassam had the impression of watching a vast beehive full of lively , intelligent , happy people . How large the population might be , he could n't guess , and Samuel did n't know . Samuel told him that the whole camp would be making a " progress " the next day . Rassam thought that might give him a better opportunity to judge the size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their retinue . Samuel sent some of them to Rassam and Blanc with dishes full of the meat in the same spicy paste they had already tasted , and many other foods , along with alcoholicdrinks , sour milk , and woven jugs full of water . It was another great honor , Dahon explained , since this was food from the emperor 's own table . After dark , Samuel appeared , leading two mules that staggered beneathbulging saddlebags . " This is for you , " he panted . " A gift from the emperor . " They opened the saddlebags and found them full of Austrian Maria Theresa dollars , the minting of 1728 . " It is five thousand dollars , " said Samuel . " He says , too , that he will supply your servants with food and other necessities for as long as you are his guests . He suggests that you use some of this money to hire more servants and to buy beasts of burden , but he emphasizes that this is only a suggestion from one friend to another , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is agreeable to the Lord Iyesus . " " Agreeable to the Lord Jesus ? " " Jesus , Iyesus , the same . Those were his words . " Thinking that he might be able to draw Samuel out on the subject of Theodore , Rassam asked , " The emperor is a very religious man , is n't he ? " " Ho , very religious , " exclaimed Samuel . " A very great man of God . " " I 've heard he has a special relationship with God . " Samuel knew instantly what Rassam was trying to do . He drew himself up proudly and said , " Master Rassam , I beg to explain something to you . I have been assigned by the Emperor Theodore to be your balderaba . The traditions that are attached to the role of balderaba are very strict in Ethiopia . As your balderaba , my allegiance to the emperoris severed , and I have become your man . As if I were your vassal , I will give your orders a higher priority than those of the emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to report to the emperor or to anyone else the things I hear you say or see you do . Even after I have returned to the emperor 's service , it will be forever forbidden for me to speak a single word about you . You may have perfect faith that I will not spy on you , nor carry any tales.  | " But neither will I carry tales about the emperor , who has been my master for ten years , and who is the greatest man in our history since the days of Menelik , son of Solomon , son of David . Anything else you want to know , I will gladly tell you , but I will not speak to you of the emperor . Anything that he wants you to know about himself , he will tell you . " Samuel 's whole body was shaking with emotion . Rassam believed him . He salaamed as gracefully as he could to the old man and said , " I thank you for the explanation , Samuel . I am sorry I placed you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Samuel forgave the error immediately . He stayed with Rassam and Blanc through the evening , answering their questions about Ethiopia until they could n't think of anything more to ask . Samuel and Dahon had both been stunned by the amount of honor that the emperor had heaped upon the Britishers . Again and again during the night , they returned to that topic . As far as either of them could remember , no one had ever been greeted in a manner approachingthis . Samuel had slept with the other servants in the smaller tent , but long before dawn a messenger from the emperor awakened him , and now he led Rassam swiftly through the sleeping tent city . Sentries paced the dark aisles at wide intervals , but they recognized Samuel and the feringi and let them pass without a word . They went beyond the outer boundary of the tent city and the last loose line of sentries . They topped a shallow rise . Samuel stopped and pointed . A white-robed shape stood out against a black line of trees . Rassam walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knee-high grass . He made a great deal of noise as he approached , but the emperor did not move . Theodore was alone at the edge of a grove of trees . He wore ankle-length white trousers and a plain white shama . His arms were bare , thick and well-rounded , and he stood half a head taller than Rassam . His right foot was tucked against the inside of his left knee in the African herder 's stance , and he balanced easily on his left leg and on the shaft of a spear that he held in his hands . It was the exact position that Captain Speedy had drawn nearly two years before . Theodore was gazing out across a wide , downward-sloping vista toward the east . His face was obscured in darkness . He was a human this time , and not a semidivine bundle of clothes speaking words like an ancient oracle , but the mystery of the early-morning summons and the dark isolation of the place caught Rassam off guard again . Also , something about the emperor 's comfortable stance created an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of something else that Rassam could not name . Perhaps it was serenity , perhaps religious certainty . He did not have the look of a man who expected to die soon , as Paniotti had suggested . Hussain thought again of the Buddha . The emperor turned his head slowly , regally , like a lion . L le spoke flawless , Yemeni-accented Arabic . his voice was sonorous and power/ful . Theodore began without greeting Rassam , as if the ideas had too great a need to be spoken to waste time on preliminaries . Rassam , standing half a dozen paces from him , was in his spell instantly . " I have read the Queen 's letter , " he said . " It is a good letter . I think she wants to be my friend . Also , I like the presents that she has sent by you . The Queen has asked that I release my prisoners . She is subtle and does not call them prisoners , ' but we are men of honesty and can speak truthfully . Consul Cameron and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me is over , and so I have already sent an escort to bring them to you . " " I thank Your Majesty , " said Rassam . All he could think about was that everything he had aimed at for so long had just been granted . He could leave with the captives . The emperor turned to gaze down the slope toward the east . He was silent for a moment . Then he said , " I asked you to meet me here for an important reason . You are a man of some intellect , or so I have been told . I wish to tell you certain things that I have told no man for many years . They are things that I can not tell my own advisors , not even Magiga Dulou or Wolde , for they would not understand . Do you know why I met you yesterday in such state , with armies , wrapped in an imperial robe , unable to talk directly to you , unable to have you come near me ? " " It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is , but I find it  --  have always found it  --  repugnant . I met you that way because my people expected it . I am their emperor , their leader , the focus of their world . I carry the weight of them on my shoulders . So , I carry on charades for them . But I can not speak before them , for they would not understand . Mr. Rassam , what do you think is the enemy of Ethiopia ? " " I 've heard you consider the Turks your enemy , though  --  " " Not the Turks , though my people will tell you that . No , it is a fact of history that we are invulnerable to them here in our mountains , just as they are safe from us . But my people need the Turks to be their enemy , so I play that charade , too . No , the Turks are not the enemy . The enemy is ignorance . The soil is rich here . There is plenty of rain . There are forests full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make good leather . There are thousands of men who can read and write . But despite all this there is no prosperity . And the reason is ignorance . " The cities and roads were built three hundred years ago by the Portuguese . They have n't been repaired since . There are no industries . We could irrigate to open up huge areas of new farmland , but we do n't know how . Our educated men could learn these things and teach the rest of us , but they spend their whole lives poring over the holy books and writing useless poetry . " The greatest problem of all , the greatest sign of our ignorance , isp213war . The peasants are afraid to grow more than they can eat , because the armies will come and take it . " The true enemy of Ethiopia is ignorance . There is no light in our country . " He lapsed into another long silence . Rassam considered what the emperor was saying . There was nothing of the mystic here , nor of the madman . Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned about the futureof his nation . The time that passed in silence was made comfortable somehow by the emperor 's serenity . Theodore finally broke the spell . " Plowden and Bell came at a time when I was ready for them . It was remarkable that these men came from so far away , and yet devoted themselves so completely to our country . There are those who will say they were only interested in their own gain , that they were mercenaries , but that is only slander . They never wanted anything but to help me bring Ethiopiainto the light . " They brought new ideas that I , in my ignorance , would never have had . We worked together . We had a dream of an Ethiopia that might exist someday : roads , cities , bridges , industries , teachers , schools , trade with other countries , peace . We built a few roads . We set men to work improving the cities . Plowden worked to establish friendship between your Queen and me . But things went slowly , because Ethiopia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mine for a few years as it had been no man 's for centuries . There was peace . They helped me make changes in the laws , too . I ended the slave trade . I sent out my own officers to govern the provinces . I encouraged caravans and pilgrims to other nations . We were happy in those times , though we were displeased that my people did not seem to understand what we were doing . " But then God turned against me . My wife , Tawavitch , died . Bell and Plowden were killed . Rebellions began to rise up against me in all parts of the country . I felt alone . I often drank liquor until I lost control of myself . I know people still remember those days , and they tell stories about what an evil man I was . Well , I will tell you , my friend , that I did many evil things during those times . But those times were past before Cameron came to me . " When he came , I hoped he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a man of words and nothing else . They say I put him in prison because he did not deliver my letter to the Queen , and because he visited the Turks . That is what I told my people , that is what they believe . But those were n't the true reasons . I knew he had sent my letter . I knew he was not betraying me with the Turks . Tell me , do you believe in prophecy ? " liassam gulped at the sudden question . " Yes , " he said , though he didnot " I tell you , then , that God promised me long ago that a man would come from far away , and he would bring light to my country . This man , I knew , was neither Bell nor Plowden , since they did not match the signs that had been foretold . But still I thought that with their help I could bring the light to my country , and so we worked for Ethiopia until God turned against me and killed them . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to bring light to Ethiopia without waiting for the prophecy of the Lord to come to pass ? " " Not if your intentions were good . " " It was a sin of pride , a sin of lack of faith . I should have waited calmly , prepared the way . I should have had the faith to wait . When Cameron came , I hoped for a few vain days that he might be the promised one , the Light Bringer , but he was not . For a few days , I actually doubted that God had ever spoken to me . I thought I had invented the propheciesin my own mind . But then I realized , in a revelation , that Cameron had been given to me not to be the Light Bringer , but to bring that one to me . I knew it was true . I was being given another chance . I prepared myself to accept and welcome the Light Bringer when he came . God had told me long ago , through an ancient monk , the signs for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each morning , and I told Him over and over again that I would not impede the promised one , that I would accept him and fulfill my fate . Do you find all this hard to believe ? " " God works in mysterious ways , " mumbled Rassam , somewhat unoriginally . This new direction in the emperor 's monologue had confusedhim , upset his opinions . " When Cameron made me angry , I realized that I must use him to bring the Light Bringer to me . I put Cameron in prison , but I treated him well . I allowed his messengers to travel freely through my domain . I knew your government would send someone else to try and release him . They sent you . I waited for long months , waiting for the signs that would tell me you are the Light Bringer . One of the signs appeared while you were in Massawa . Another appeared when you were in Wochnee . I now await the others . " Rassam suddenly realized what Theodore was saying . " Me ? You think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already seen two of these signs . I await the others in order to be sure . " " What kinds of signs ? " " I had waited for the signs to appear for nearly two years after you arrived in Massawa , and none had appeared . I tired of waiting and sent for you to come to me , and immediately one of the signs was revealed to me . The Light Bringer is to set people free from bondage . In Massawayou rose up boldly and crushed the slave trade . " Elephants will fall before the Light Bringer . In Wochnee you shot an elephant , and he surely fell before you.  | " The other signs , the ones I am awaiting , I can not tell you . I watch for them . " Rassam felt all the easy gains slipping away , felt himself being swallowedup by an impossible situation . " What can I do ? " " It is not for you to do anything , until the time of the Light Bringer . It is only for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thinking . " How could I bring light to Ethiopia ? I know no industries , no crafts , nothing about farming or building . I can not do anything . " " You are a great man in your country , " said Theodore . " Perhaps it is through your great influence that you will bring the light . As you said , God works in mysterious ways . A great man like you could cause artisansto come . There are many things you could do . " Rassam felt the urge to shout , I am not a great man . I am the least significant of men . But he could not . He bowed his head in silence . Theodore was also silent . The first ray of the sun appeared through a cleft between two distant mountains . Theodore looked straight into its light , and Rassam studied his profile . His face was that of a man born to lead men , who would have risen to leadership wherever he was born , no matter how high or low , no matter how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the face of a man who knew , and through this knowing , whether it was true or not , could become a Christ or Mohammedor Buddha , a great thinker or a martyr . " Our people worshiped the sun at one time , " whispered Theodore . " They thought the sun was a god . They worshiped the moon and the stars , too . In the Bible you can read how Joseph had a dream in which stars , representing his brothers , made obeisance to him . Solomon had a dream of suns . And I , the Emperor Theodore who was a boy named Kasa , I saw a vision of suns and stars . My vision foretold the futurefor me just as surely as the dreams of Joseph and Solomon foretoldtheir futures . What the dream prophesies for me , that I must do ... " Cameron and the others are of no use to me now , so I give them to you and your Queen . I release them , and you are free to do what you will with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Queen . I ask that you arrange for an embassy to travel with safe conduct to England . And I ask that you , Mr. Rassam , will be my friend . " Theodore held out his arms , and Rassam fell into his embrace . " I have waited long to see you , " said Theodore . " I 've waited long , too , " said Rassam , though he did n't know whether Theodore was referring to him as Rassam or as the Light Bringer . " You may go now , " said Theodore . " We will progress this morning , and for the next several clays . We travel often , for no one area could feed so many people for long , but on this progress we shall pass near lake Tana . You will he carried iii boats across the lake , and in Korata snu will await Cameron and the others .. "  |p216Rassam  bowed formally to the emperor , and he made his way back through the grass to where Samuel was waiting for him . The meeting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a heady mixture of solid pragmatism and religious zeal , practical one moment and mystical the next , so simple and yet so complex , so strong and yet so fragile . Signs . Theodore was watching for signs : when he spoke about them , it was hard to disbelieve . Rassam 's impressions were confusing , but one thing was clear to him : odd as it might seem , he liked the emperor . Standing on his left foot , leaning his weight against the shaft of his spear , Theodore remained alone after Rassam left him . The rising sun gentled the plateau to life . Tiny birds darted through the trees and the grass and challenged each other in shrill voices . Gazelles grazed close enough for him to see their lustrous eyes , and then spotted him and trotted away with fluid steps . Ants marched across the imperial foot , and a fly lit on the imperial eyelid . The gorge of the Big Abai , the Blue Nile , ran across his field of vision to the east , and Lake Tana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but distinct cloud patterns , ruddy in the early morning light , pinpointed their locations . The question of signs filled his mind . Identifying the Light Bringer was to be the critical act of his life . For this identification , there were not the usual one or two signs . There were five . The first sign , as Theodore had explained , was that the Light Bringer would set people free from bondage . The second sign was that elephants would fall down before the Light Bringer . These two signs had already been fulfilled . Though it was not one of the foretold signs , Theodore had added his own to the list . It was appropriate that the Light Bringer should come to him accompanied by thousands of men , to represent the myriad stars . Since it was his own sign , Theodore did not feel he had seriously violated it by providing those thousands himself . There remained three more signs to be fulfilled . The Light Bringer would accept Theodore 's help through a difficult place . The Light Bringer would usurp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bringer would blame Theodore for what Theodore had done , and even when Theodore humbled himself publicly and begged forgiveness , the Light Bringer would never forgive him . Theodore felt as if he were nearing a destination toward which he had been traveling for many years . The Light Bringer was in Ethiopia . Three signs remained . The illumination would begin , and Theodore would be dead . It would be a glorious death , certainly , there to the south , atop that flat-topped mountain , in the great fortress that hisp217long-dead feringi had built for him , exploding into flame , preserved forever in the memory of his people , but death in all its terrifying majesty nonetheless . A nerve deep inside his cheek twitched , but , as always , his surface remained as still as a monument . All this for Rassam ? That timid man , the Light Bringer ? To die to make room for Rassam ?  |p219Samuel  had hired four Ethiopian boys as servants , and had purchased three pack mules . By the time Samuel and Rassam returned to their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being expertly folded , tied , and fastened to the mules . It was obvious from the way the boys sang , laughed , and ran back and forth through the campsite that they were brand-new employees , eager to please . Blanc sat in the middle of it all , barefoot , bareheaded , dressed once again in his worn travelingsuit , sipping a cup of something hot . Is that coffee ? " asked Rassam . Its rich aroma dominated all the other pungent morning smells . The Arabic word for coffee is identical to the Amharic . Two of the boys heard him and raced to bring him a cup . Grounds were floating in it , and it was so thick it would almost have made a meal in itself . " Why so early ? " groaned Blanc . " In the middle of the night the tent started coming down around my head . Right around my head . Samuel orders , ' the boys said . They 'd obviously learned the words by rote , do n't speak another word of Arabic . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up from checking the knots on one of the mules , and called out , " It is essential to start early . You will see why when the progress has begun . " Ile walked back and forth like an elderly weasel , urging the boys to work faster , tightening ropes and redoing saddles , always trying to speed things up . I le motioned Blanc off the trunk on which he had been sitting , then waved them both away . They walked out of the camp and watched from downhill . " Where were you so early ? " asked Blanc ' . " The emperor wanted to see me . " Somehow , Bassam did n't want top220tell Blanc any more than that . He knew he could never explain the things the emperor had said in such a way that Blanc would n't laugh at them . " And ? " " The captives . They 've been set free . We made a good impression , I suppose . " " Set free ? Marvelous . " " Yes , " said Rassam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Consul Cameron . " Samuel waved at them from the top of the hill and called , " We are ready to begin , masters . Come . " " Anything more ? " asked Blanc , as they started up the hill toward Samuel . " No , it was a short audience . " " When can we start for home ? " " A few days . " " Marvelous , " repeated Blanc , but Rassam only nodded and said softly , " Marvelous . " They adjusted their clothing and settled their solar helmets on their heads , took their walking sticks and parasols firmly in hand , and mounted their horses . Halfway to the outskirts of the camp they discovered the reasons for Samuel 's urgency . There were dozens more people and animals on the trail ahead of them , and more were filtering in from every side . Before they had gone another hundred yards , the jam-up locked them into place . Circumventing the trail was out of the question ; there was nothing to do but wait . The sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Blanc and Rassam choked on it . The noise was overwhelming . By noon they had barely reached the outskirts of the camp . Herds of cattle and sheep that had been grazing outside the camp joined the progress , adding their stink and noise and dust . " I tried to get us moving early , " said Samuel with a toothy , unconcernedgrin , " but our boys were n't quick enough . Perhaps tomorrow we can get away before the rest of the emperor 's people . It is not so dusty in front . " They had been standing in the same place for more than an hour when a small group of horsemen came prancing down the sheer slope toward them , the ponies struggling hard to maintain their footing , the soldiers perfectly confident and relaxed in the lurching saddles . Magiga Dulou was in the lead . " I have been searching for you , " he shouted to Rassam . " The emperor wishes you to be escorted to the front of the progress , out of this confusion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his horsemen began to shove the people and animals ahead of them oil the trail . People went down into the mud and came up cursing and shaking their fists . Rassam started to protest , but Blanc shouted , " Oh , jolly good , won/derful fellows ! " and jammed his heels into his horse to get it jogging down the cleared trail . Samuel seized the halter of one of the pack mules and followed Blanc . The servants rushed into line , and Rassam 's horse followed by itself . Magiga Dulou 's pace was slower than that he would have taken on a normal journey , but they worked their way steadily through the hordes and into the countryside . The road turned into a gently undulatingdownward slope where they had somewhat more elbowroom , and they began to pick up speed . At the bottom of the slope the progress was pressed up against a narrow but swiftly moving white-water stream . Most of the people were pushing their way toward the wide ford , and so the ground before it was crowded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoved into the deep water , where their animalsfoundered . The onlookers stopped to laugh and applaud , further adding to the confusion . Magiga Dulou and his men struggled through to the ford , and Rassam and Blanc and their people followed , inside a protective wedge of warriors . They lurched across the stream and broke into a canter away from the direct line of travel beyond . Several thousand people had already got past the ford , but here at least they were able to spread out over the wide meadows and proceed at a comfortable pace . After an hour or so , however , the progress came up against another obstruction . The entire horde had stopped , and the jostling crowd was constantly growing . Magiga Dulou stood up in his saddle and looked ahead , then sent stream , wider acid slower than the first , flowed through the bottom of a shallow ravine . . A crescent-shaped line of foot soldiers were holding people back from the stream , but they parted long enough to let Rassam 's party into the wide arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terraces had been cut down to the ford , and on the far hank a company of soldiers was working with shovels and spades to construct another series of terraces from the ford out of the ravine . A tall , well-muscled man , naked to the waist , shovel in hand , was directing t hems with shouts and gestures , digging and sweating along with them . Rassam stared at the man , thought he might recognize him , but the sun was shining too brightly for him to see clearly . He swung his pink parasol out and snapped it open , then angled it over his head so it blocked the sun 's rays . Yes , the sweating man directing the workers was the emperor . ' Theodore saw Rassam and his party , smiled in recognition , and began to wave them across the stream  --  but his hand froze in midair . The smile vanished , turned to anger , then slid into amazement . Itassanc shrugged his shoulders . wondering what was wrong , and at that instant Samuel was at his sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he whispered harshly . It was a definite order , no tone Rassam would expect from a servant . Rassam hesitated , and Samuel repeated , more urgently , " Put it down at once . " Rassam collapsed the parasol and tucked it back under his arm . " What is the matter ? " " The parasol , " said Samuel , " it is one of the emperor 's insignia . " His voice was filled with dread . " No one but he may use the parasol . It is like wearing a crown in the presence of a king . " " My God , " muttered Rassam . " Thank you , Samuel . Please do me the favor of going to him at once and telling him I did n't know , that I apologize . " " At once , " said Samuel . He flew down the terraces to the ford and started across . Halfway across the stream he bowed down so low that his face touched the water , and he kept it there , almost submerged , until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belly he writhed like a salamander up the terrace to Theodore . He reached the emperor and kissed the mud on Theodore 's foot . Without looking down at his old servant , Theodore snapped his fingers and said a single word . Samuel leaped upright and bowed , then talked for a long time . Too great a distance separated Rassam and Theodore for the envoy to be able to see the emperor 's eyes , but from the angle of his unmoving face Rassam knew the emperor was staring hard at him . He wilted under the pressure of that gaze . The emperor 's lips finally moved . Samuel spun around and came running back down the terraces and through the stream . " The emperor says he understands your intention was not to insult him , " Samuel said . " He forgives . " Samuel leaned panting against Rassam 's saddle . " He asks you to join him . Both of you . " Rassam kicked his horse a few steps nearer to the first terrace . The mud was wet and deep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come across . Rassam let out a sharp breath , pointed his horse 's muzzle at the stream below , and gave it a vicious kick in the ribs . It took half a step , then locked its knees . Rassam kicked again . It whinnied , braced itself , and would not move . Theodore called out , and Samuel shouted and slapped the horse . It jumped forward , then found itself too close to the edge to stop . Its hooves sank into the mud , and it jerked and slipped down the terraces to the stream . Rassam almost lost his seat , but then they were safe on the gravelly bank of the stream . The horse stopped . Rassam looked up . The soldiers had halted their work and were watching the crazy feringi 's first encounter with the independence of an Ethiopian horse . Alone among them , Theodore was not laughing . He was waiting patiently now , watching ; Rassam closely , with a look of knowing what was about to happen . Rassam prodded the horse into the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Surprisingly , he made it easily to the other side , but the horse refused to start up the terraces , no matter how Rassam urged , begged , or kicked . Finally , disgusted , Rassam swung down and started up on foot . His leather boot soles slipped in the mud . One boot stuck , and he fell to his knees . The soldiers again began to erupt into laughter , but Theodore silencedthem with one angry gesture . Rassam got up and tried again . He slipped and fell . One of the soldiers started down toward him to help , but Theodore shouted frantically and waved him back , and then he himself clambered down the terraces to Rassam . " Be of good cheer , " he said , extending his hand . " Do not be afraid . " " I thank you , " said Rassam , " but Your Majesty does me too much honor by helping me . " " Have I a choice ? " asked the emperor as they reached the top together . Rassam knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head wearily . " In some things , none of us have choices , " he said . " I do n't understand . " " Signs , " said Theodore . " We can not escape them , much as we would like . " " What about signs ? " " Two more have I seen . You usurped my rights in my presence . I helped you through a difficult place . One sign remains . " " One ? " breathed Rassam . One more . The confusion rose like a hollow hall in his chest . One more sign , and then ? Blanc got across the stream , and his horse lurched easily up the terraces . Blanc dismounted and tipped his hat to the emperor . " Your Majesty. , , The emperor seemed momentarily shocked by the casual salute , then burst out with a laugh . He salaamed to Blanc . " Beastly hot , " remarked Blanc . " Beastly hot ? " asked the emperor . " Hot like the beasts ? " Blanc had translated " beastly " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rassam explained the misunderstanding . I understand , " said Theodore . " And yes , I must agree that it is indeed beastly hot , by the power of God . " Rassam 's party found a shady spot under a huge baobab tree , and Irmil there they watched the warriors digging their terraces . Theodore led by example with his shovel . Ile dug like a man possessed , as if trying to lose himself in physical labor , and his followers picked up their rhvthnr from him . They began a fast , impelling chant . Occasionally , ( luring a lull irr the chant . Theodore stood up from the rnrid , wiped his brow , and looked at Ilassan- . But he did not seem top224actually see Rassam the man , perhaps seeing instead Rassam the idea , Rassam the long-awaited . Something in his look said that all doubts in the world had been removed , that a supposed future was now a certainty . Rassam felt that he was out of his territory , wandering lost and at the mercy of unknown forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazy movement far in the distance told him that more people were still joining the crowd around the ford . Clouds of dust were rising beyond the farthest limits of sight . How many people were there ? At last the terraces were done , and Theodore waved the nearest ranks down to the stream , across , and back up to the level ground . They went slowly , with many slips and false starts and balks by the animals , but they finally got there . Theodore was on the terraces to help them , crying out encouragement , carrying small children in his arms , offering a firm hand to an old woman , slapping the rump of a reluctant mule . When it was clear that the terraces would do their job , Theodore and his personal escort threw their shamas about their shoulders , mounted their horses , and started toward the front of the column , which was already winding into the next series of hills . Theodore waved Rassam and Blanc up to join him . They traveled together for the two hours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man Rassam had seen at the pavilion or outside the camp at dawn or in the mud of the terraces . Rassam wondered which was the real Theodore . There was neither formality nor moroseness nor religious fervor about him . He spoke cheerfully on a wide range of topics . He amazed Rassam both by his curiosity and by his understanding of the world beyond Ethiopia . Though his sources of information were scanty , he knew a little about all the main events in world affairs . He asked dozens of questions during those two hours , and Rassam , far removed from newspapers , was only able to answer a few of them : Was the American war over ? Why had they fought ? Had England taken sides ? Why had the English fought the Ashantis ? Would the Egyptian Viceroy fight the Turkish Sultan ? Would Garibaldi try to seize Rome by force ? At the top of a very high ridge Rassam turned in his saddle and looked back at the masses of people who had crossed the stream and the thousands who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incredible numbers , but Rassam did his best to visually break down his field of vision into squares , to judge the number of people in each square , and to arrive at a total figure . He decided at last that he could see one hundred and fifty thousand people . Clouds of dust were still rising in the distance . " Have you ever counted your people ? " he asked Theodore . It was the prophet Theodore who answered : " ' There is a Biblical injunction against numbering of the people . Do you not recall howp225David ordered his captain Joab to number the people , and how the Lord was angry and brought pestilence to the land ? " Rassam swiveled around and looked again at the progress of the emperor 's encampment . Since he had turned away , even more must have appeared over the most distant visible ridge . One hundred fifty t liousand people . One in five a fighting man , in this warlike land wherevery able-bodied man was a warrior . That comes to an army of thirty t Thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even armed with spears an army of thirty thousand men . . . And Theodore must be able to call on thousands more from the rest of the nation . " How are so many fed ? " asked Rassam . A shadow crossed the emperor 's smiling face . Rassam realized he should have known better than to ask such a question . " As the emperor , " said Theodore , " I receive tribute and taxes from all my vassals . It is a vast amount of food , material , and gold . I receive tribute that my army , which is necessary to the peace of the nation , should eat . " Rassam recalled how Paniotti had explained to him that Theodore was the first Ethiopian leader to pay his soldiers , and so to stop them from pillaging the land ; how Theodore was able to pay his soldiers because he collected fair tax from each of his provinces . The rebellions in the border provinces must have reduced the amount of tax money that was coming in . Theodore 's answer might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be true now . Rassam wondered how he managed to continue paying and feeding his hungry , nonproducing army and their families . A partial answer came at sunset . Rassam 's party had pitched their tents on a gentle rise near the hill chosen for the emperor 's compound . Though some of them were still ten miles away , all the emperor 's horde stopped where they were the moment the emperor 's banner first flutteredover his tent . Samuel explained that the emperor would remain where he was for a day or two , until everyone had caught up , and then l u would make another stage . Thousands of tents of all sizes and colors went up all over the countrysideto the limits of sight , and certainly far beyond that . Then , as campfires began to send up wraiths of thin smoke , wraiths that soon twined into a single , vast cloud , hundreds of men headed out from the route of travel into the nearest fields . Something had disturbed Rassam ahxnit the countryside , and now he realized  --  such an obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were no local people anywhere , only the people of the emperor 's horde . The emperor 's followers now stripped the deserted fields of their raps , looted the villages along the way , and brought back what would have been gathered in earlier , happier times through even-handed rihute collection , spread out ; cross all of Ethiopia and so made easy foriwne instead of devastating for a few.  |p226It  was the old way , the way armies had been supported throughout the centuries before Theodore  --  and now it was the way again . While Blanc commented in a low , secretive tone on the barbarity of it , Rassam could only wonder what pain this grim necessity must cause a monarch who gave every indication of loving his subjects . Rassam sat on the Lake Tana shore one evening and watched a band of warriors build the entire imperial navy . They cut down bulrushes , wove them into two thick mats that were six feet wide by twenty feet long , rolled the mats up and tied the ends  --  and two boats were lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were to wait for Consul Cameron , just after dawn the next morning . Rassam and Blanc , one in each boat , sat on bundles of bulrushes , rolled up their pants , and held on while their paddlers towed them into the lake . On the shore Samuel and Dahon waved good-by while the Ethiopian boys struck the camp . The servants were going to take the roundabout land route to Korata because , as Samuel explained , being brought across by boat was too great an honor . The paddlers , stark naked , knelt in the bow and stern . They propelled the boats by slapping the water with long sticks , sending great fountains over their passengers . The boats moved sluggishly through the water , and wallowed deeper as each hour passed . The paddlers were afraid to get very far from dry land , so they set a sinuous course through coves and around long peninsulas . The lake shore was a thick rain forest of acacias , banyons , lily pads , and baobabs . Wide streams oozed into the lake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were blue starlings , fish eagles , black-and-white kingfishers , and giant toucans . Pythons swam around the boats and draped overhead from branch to branch . It took twelve hours to skirt the lake to Korata , by which time one of the boats had three inches of freeboard left and the other was entirely submerged except for the stern and the tip of the bow . Korata appeared as a walled city low on the lakefront , glowing red in the sunset , studded with ostrich eggshell crosses . The shore was crowded with an unruly mob of priests , monks , and debteras , with iron crosses in their hands and turbans on their heads . They had come to meet the famous feringi , and they let out a cheer . Crosses waved in the air like weapons , and the holy men pushed down to the water and thrashed into it so eagerly that Rassam began to wonder whether this reception was friendly or not  --  but Samuel appeared like a black angel out of the crowd , shouted until he could be heard , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britishers out of the crowd and away from the city . The servants , Rassam learned as they walked to their tents , had taken seven hours to ride to Korata . They had set up camp , prepared dinner , and still had several hours left over to rest before Bassani and Blancp227arrived . But Samuel was quick to remind Rassam and Blanc of what an honor it was to have been brought across the lake by boat . Cameron was at least three weeks away , so Rassam and Blanc settled into their newest temporary home to wait . They rose early each morning and hunted until the heat drove them back to their tents . There were wooded regions nearby where they shot giant toucans and py-t bons and hippopotami . Deep in the foliage , masked by distracting branches , the toucan was a fairly challenging shot . Pythons and hippopotamiwere ridiculously easy . They shot the useless pythons out of some inborn hatred for serpents , and watched them uncoil slowly from the branches and quiver as they dangled down . Hippopotami wallowed just under the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always bring the giants thrashing to the top where a shot from Blanc 's large-bore elephant gun would send them bubbling , bleeding , back into the muddy depths . In the afternoons , Blanc pursued his study of Ethiopian diseases and cures . Rassam studied Amharic with a crippled old priest who spoke passable Arabic . Gifts for Rassam arrived daily from Theodore . The gifts were sometimesprecious , sometimes filled with honor : a brace of partridges shot by the emperor himself and brought at a dead run by a relay of horsemenwhile they were still fresh ; a pair of fine antique pistols ; a white robe with the Lion of Judah embroidered on it in gold thread . Accordingto Samuel , this robe was the highest honor a man could receive from the Ethiopian emperor . Rassam wrote back thanking Theodore for the gifts , complimenting and praising him , saying the bland nothings he thought the emperor would want to hear . There were isolated moments when Rassam felt himself distrusting the emperor 's promise , when he remembered the business of the signs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments were infrequent . He usually allowed himself to be lulled into what even he knew was a false sense of security . For the most part , he was more confident and cheerful than he had been at any time since he had read Disraeli 's speech in the London Times , five months before . The days were pleasant enough , and the nights were cold but bearablebeside a roaring fire on the beach or bundled up in a thick Smyrna rug in his tent . Time stood still for this long moment , trapped between all the events of the past and the uncertainty of the future . After a little more than three weeks , on March io , 1866 , the Magdala prisoners arrived in Korata . A Goan servant appeared in camp and asked in stumbling English for permission to approach , and while he was running back up the path Rassam and Blanc dressed carefully in their uniforms . Then they strode out to meet the consul . There were two Europeans in the midst of fifty Ethiopian warriors . All were riding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ritual of meeting fellow-Europeans in a savage land had a longp228and inflexible tradition behind it . As befitted his higher rank , Rassam slowed his steps and halted entirely , so it would be Cameron who came to him . A gust of wind caught a rag hanging from a pole held by one of the Europeans , and a handmade Union Jack fluttered out . Blanc called , " God save the Queen . " His voice was choked with emotion . The one who held the flag answered , " God save the Queen . " The Magdala party stopped twenty paces from Rassam and Blanc , and the older European , the one without the flag , dismounted and walked toward them . He wore a solar helmet and a faded blue suit with tails . His beard , which was very short and neatly trimmed , was a mousy brown , and so were his tiny eyes . His steps were short and deliberate , full of fatigue and hinting at poor health . He stopped two paces away , tapped his solar helmet , fiddled nervouslywith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rassam 's , then sneaked away . Cameron had come to them , and the ritual said he was supposed to introduce himself , but there was only a brittle silence , another cough , then more silence . At last , Rassam said , " Afternoon , sir . I am Envoy Rassam . This is Captain Blanc . " He put out his hand . Cameron 's rodent eyes took in the hand , then leaped away . He started to stick out his own hand , but it only got halfway to Rassam 's before a compulsion took control of it . His hand jumped up and pulled at his beard with the intensity of a frightened child stroking a blanket . " Mmmmmmm , Envoy Rassam , " he whispered . He worked the hand away from his beard , touched Rassam 's hand for one fleeting instant , and let his hand return to his beard . " Delighted . Mm , Captain Blanc . " He touched Blanc 's hand . " Good of you to come . " " Our pleasure , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the distance , he quizzically raised his eyebrows at Rassam . " Are you in good health ? " asked Rassam . " Not very , " said Cameron . He seemed suddenly able to make the mental leap from wherever his mind had been wandering to the hereand-now . " Come and meet our enthusiastic young patriot , Mr. Kerens . " Laurence Kerens was twenty-two years old , ruddy-faced , with the pale , downy mustache and goatee of an adolescent boy . He smiled eagerly at Rassam and Blanc , and could hardly limit himself to a brief , dignified handshake . " Very pleased to meet you at last , sirs , " he laughed . " Have you heard the news , gentlemen ? " asked Rassam . " Nothing , " said Cameron . " We shall all be going home soon . I have the emperor 's promise . " " A promise  --  " muttered Cameron , and his eyes drifted away . " So that 's the lake , " said Kerens . " I 've been in this country I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rather like an ocean , is n't it ?  |p229Has  it a tide ? " He looked along the shoreline to the tents . " This is a jolly place to stay . You can see forever , over the water . You 'd be surprised at how a man longs for room to let his eyes sprint ahead when he 's surrounded by high walls . Are there crocodiles in the lake ? " " A few , " answered Blanc , who had recognized a man of his own kind immediately . " There are more hippos . Pythons in the jungle , too . " " Have you a gun ? " " Several . Do you shoot ? " " Of course . Oh , what fun . " " Well , then , time is flitting by , " said Blanc . " There are still a few hours of daylight left . " " We can shoot now ? " " Come with me . If you will excuse us , gentlemen . " Kerens looked at Rassam . " Oh , I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just met . " " Not at all , " said Rassam . " The consul and I need to have a talk , in any case . " Kerens and Blanc dashed off to the tents to get Blanc 's guns . " Amazing , " said Rassam . " After all he 's been through , and he 's still more interested in shooting a hippo than in hearing what is going to happen to him . " " The resiliency of youth , " said Cameron , in a crisp voice that anannouncedhe was back to the real world again . " The whole thing has been an adventure to him . Never a thought about the danger . All he wants from the future is to be able to grow a decent beard . I was like that once . " " Would you care to bring your people down and have them start setting up your camp ? " asked Rassam . " Yes . Of course . " In addition to Kerens , Cameron had with him half a dozen servants . They began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of Cameron and Kerens  --  whether captive or free  --  was ' lot clear . All but ten of the Ethiopian warriors turned their horses back began the return trip to Magdala at once . The remaining ten pitched tents at a little distance from Cameron 's , and then proceeded to ignore the Europeans . Neither Rassam nor Cameron knew whether their orders were to protect the British , or to keep an eye on them . While the tents were going up , Rassam took Cameron for a walk along the shore . " I 've waited for you for a very long time , " said Cameron . " I expected you during the last dry season . " his tone was not accusatory , but Rassam felt a twinge of guilt . " Diplomatic protocol , " he murmured . " Never forgot about you . " " Naturally . It has been a very long time , though . " ' Has your imprisonment been miserable ? " " Hard enough . Not as had as it could have been , " said Cameron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prison . Other than that , not so bad . " He began to ramble along , one word tumbling quickly after the last without a pause to catch his breath , and Rassam could n't tell whether his mind was here on the shore , or wandering , or half here and half away . Cameron pulled continually at his beard with his right hand . " When I came to Ethiopia , the emperor was eager to establish relations with Great Britain . No , eager is too mild a word  --  he was fervid , frantic , as if establishing diplomatic relations was the only thing standingbetween him and death . I had but to make a suggestion , and he would leap at it . He had presents actually prepared and waiting to send with his embassy to England , as soon as the Queen 's letter arrived . " I tried to explain the situation to London , but the distance is so great , and there is such a gulf between the English and the Ethiopians , that I could n't make them understand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kassala , but those were my orders . What else could I do ? I clung to my faith that the Queen 's letter would turn his anger into joy . I was still sure the letter was coming , you see . It had to be coming . There was no reason on God 's earth for it not to come . " I assigned Mr. Kerens the task of waiting in Massawa for the packet , and when it arrived , he hurried up to Ethiopia with it , still unopened . If he had opened it , he might have saved himself a great deal of grief . There was no letter in the packet . I have no hesitation in blaming F.O. for all that has happened to us . " " Those are the reasons for your imprisonment ? " asked Rassam , remembering what Theodore had told him . " Those are the reasons , " answered Cameron . " I can not fault the emperor for his anger , nor for the treatment we 've received . The top of the amba Magdala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ethiopian invader . It would even give a modern army difficulty . It was built by Theodore 's pet Englishmen , Bell and Plowden . Within the stockade is a permanent community of several thousands , plus a large garrison of soldiers . The prison for Theodore 's political prisoners , three or four hundred in number , is in Magdala , too . It is to Theodore 's credit  --  many 's the time I 've heard it remarked  --  that those prisoners are still alive at all . They are mostly rebel leaders who were reconciled to Theodore two or three times before he finally imprisoned them . Any of the previous emperors would have put them to death when they were first captured . Their situation is not especially bad . Those who can afford the luxury have their wives and servants with them . They are somewhat crowded , but they lack for very little but freedom . " We lived in a separate compound in several huts . Our most painful day-to-day torture was our leg irons . " Cameron stopped walking long enough to lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his ankle . " You can not imagine the pain of this the first month . It bled constantly . I wrapped it with rags during the day to ease the chafing , but I had to unwrap it at night to let the circulation through . But it isp231vital to understand that chains are not considered a torture by the I. ; thiopians . They are only an expedient way of keeping a prisoner from ( . soaping . " I was beaten during the first week , but after that I was treated well . hanks to your Maria Theresa dollars , we never lacked anything . We grew our own vegetables . We had a flower garden full of songbirds , and our servants bought us meat , water , liquor , tobacco , whatever else we I ' ceded . " " It does n't sound as onerous as I had expected , " said Rassam . " It was , at the beginning , " said Cameron . " I think the emperor orderedit so , so I would write despairing letters to our people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wanted me to write those letters . Did you not wonder how I knew your name , the first time I wrote to you ? " " I did . " " He himself told me your name . It was his messenger who took the note to you . I could have written a graceful , long letter , full of truth , but my despair was great . Can you blame a man for wanting to be free ? and when my imprisonment had eased , I made up tortures to put in the letters . They served their purpose . They reached the London newspapers . What other forum did I have , when F.O. would n't listen ? " Rassam said , " I must say I admire you for holding by your honor when heodore asked you to sign the document promising that Great Britain would take no vengeance on Theodore if he let you go . Englishmen everywhere were inspired by your courage . " Cameron tugged viciously at his beard . " Mr. Rassam , I put myself and my good name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is easy to be honorable when you are healthy and strong and courageous . It is easy to refuse to sign documents that would embarrass your country when you can still st and on your own two feet without wincing from the pain of your ankle irons . It is easy then to stand tall and cry God save the Queen . ' I 'm not a coward , Mr. Rassam . I faced the Kaffirs . I was in the Natal War , the Crimea . I do n't have to prove myself to anyone . " His voice was barely audible . " Six months ago I sent a message to the emperor asking him whether he would release us if I were to sign the document . I begged him to let me sign it . I would have done anything to be out of that prison , to be on my way home . " Ile came to me himself , a ride of more than fifty miles through the roughest terrain in the world . He came to Magdala to see me , though he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the fortress and directly to our little compound , and he walked up to me mid fell down on the ground at my feet and begged me to forgive him . le could not release me , he said , and it cut him to the quick to keep nee a prisoner . Ile had nothing against me , he said , but he had no choice . He had a purpose , he said . These are his exact words : 1 have a purpose , . ' purpose that I can not tell you , but it is a purpose greater than eitherp232of us . And so , though it hurts me greatly , I can not let you go . ' I was stunned by his sincerity and his dignity , even as he lay at my feet and begged me to forgive him . " I forgave him , of course . He went away , and he left behind a broken man , an empty shell , a man without honor . " The only things I have left now are a desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will enjoy your company if you can still speak to me after everything I 've said , but I have absolutely no faith in your ability to free us . I will never leave this country , and Kerens will never leave , and you will never leave . " Great sobs began to bubble out of him . Rassam touched his shoulder , and Cameron threw himself into Rassam 's arms . Rassam embraced him lightly , distastefully . " No one could have done anything else , " he said , though he knew his tone was not comforting . " I understand . I understand . "  |p233The  emperor of the Ethiopians will beg the Light Bringer to forgive him , but the Light Bringer will refuse : by this sign the Light Bringer will be known . Significant occasions demand public validation . The red ceremonial pavilion had been set up on the wide summit of a long , gentle hill . The Open side of the pavilion faced northward , and from his low wooden throne at the back Theodore could see the entire hillside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green in the noontime sun . Carpets had been placed on the hillside from the pavilion to the lake at a width of nine carpets  --  the holy three times three . ' Theodore was wearing the voluminous formal garment that covered nearly all his body . The silver drums were at his right hand , and someOnewas holding the red parasol so close over his head that its forward binge prevented him from seeing any of the ceiling . His advisors and his servants were with him , but he had summoned none of his armies . The camp lay mostly behind the red pavilion , and there were no people visible in front of the pavilion except for Rassam and his party . Theodore could pick them out easily , though they were still down itar the water : Rassam , Blanc , Samuel , Dahon , the boys , Magiga Dulou uId the fifty-warrior escort , the mules already loaded for the trip to the Sudan . They came across Theodore 's line of vision from the east , movingslowly along the shore . Bassani , Blanc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and began to walk up the hill toward the pavilion . Two days before , Theodore had brought his vast tent city to the lake . From his hilltop compound he could see Korata across the water , tuning white in the daytime and glowing faintly at night , and hep234could see the camp of the Europeans as tiny drops of color on the bone-white beach or as fierce pinpricks of firelight in the dark . The next morning , he had sent a messenger around the lake to Rassam . " From the slave of God , His created being , " the letter read , " the son of David , the son of Solomon , the King of Kings , Theodore . " To my most beloved Rassam . I understand that your health has held well . I am thankful to God for this news . By the blessings of Iyesus , I am well also . " I have established my quarters at the shore of the lake near the Big Abai . Your tents are visible to me , and I saw your campfires last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . " I have fulfilled half my promise , with the arrival in your presence of Mr. Cameron and Mr. Kerens . " Now , I wish that all your belongings should be made ready to begin your journey to Khartoum . In the morning , Cameron and Kerens may begin their journey around the north end of the lake . I wish you to come around to say good-by to me , after which you may continue around the south end of the lake . You may rejoin your fellow countrymen at Wochnee . My people will accompany both your groups to guarantee your safety . " There was no apparent strength in Rassam 's stride as he led his two companions up the hill of carpets . Theodore already had word of Rassam 's parting from Cameron . One of the warriors in the Ethiopian camp near the European camp had watched through Theodore 's own German telescope , and then he had ridden fast to describe it to the emperor . Cameron had been crying , the man reported , and when it was time to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rassam had made a feeble effort to calm the consul , but the spy was sure he had been near tears himself . And it was for this Rassam , weak , uncertain , frightened in Theodore 's presence , concerned only about getting home , that Theodore was supposedto die at Magdala . It was almost a joke . Rassam could n't possibly be the one  --  and yet the signs were so clear ! It was inevitable now . Rassam would refuse to forgive , and there would be the solemn journey to Magdala , and then there would be the exploding sun . In the past months , Theodore had thought about all the things that were to be left undone , all the things that could have been accomplishedif there had only been time , if only the Light Bringer had not come and if only the country had not crumbled around Theodore 's head . So much had been within his grasp , and it had all fallen away . The momentum was with the rebels now , and the day of the I.ight Bringer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of God , who would rule for forty years , slid not exist . I le was now simply Kasa ,  |p235the  Light Bringer 's balderaba , John the Baptist to Rassam 's Christ . Theodore had felt his doom approaching . The terrible purpose had drawn near . Ile had suffered the pain of having lost his dreams , and the pain of awful fear . He was afraid of not having the courage to do what he had to do ; he was afraid of making a mistake and dying for no reason  --  indeed he was afraid of death itself . The advice of his council had been predictable . Gabry was loud in Iavor of torturing all the Europeans to death to show the British governsilentthat it could n't insult the Ethiopian ruler and his people . Magiga Deulou agreed . Wolde favored swallowing pride and sending them back o Massawa , then asking Rassam to send craftsmen and engineers and soldiers to help Theodore regain what he had lost . From a great distance , Paniotti supported Wolde 's point of view , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two opinions . Theodore had not commented on their advice . He had simply sent the letter which would bring Rassam to him and give Rassam the chance to refuse forgiveness . The long years of pain had so numbed Theodore , that he felt almost nothing as he watched Rassam walk up the hill , then stop at the proper distance and wait for the signal to approach . Immediately , Theodore waved his hand , and one of the servants signaled to Samuel . Obviously astonished at the immediate response , Samuel said , " Go ahead , Master Rassam. " liassam started toward the jet-black shade of the pavilion . As he walked under the shelter of the awning , he was able to make out the same line of dim , white-clothed figures he had seen at his first formal iclience with the emperor . All of the emperor that was visible was the Upper part of his head , his hands , and the one bare foot dangling below dice garment . Rassam halted at the entrance to the pavilion , but the emperor Iperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emperor 's balderaba , cried , " Rassam only to come forward . " Before he could take his first step , Rassam felt a hand on his elbow . From behind him Samuel 's voice came low and very urgent : " If you go into the presence , you must prostrate yourself and kiss the foot . " Blanc 's voice came fast , a single biting word : " Never . " Samuel 's voice whispered : " He must . " An envoy of the Queen kneels to no man . Ever . " .. He must . " " Never . Keel ) that in mind , Mr. Rassam . Keep that in mind . " Bassani shook off the hand and the voices , and stepped into the pavilion . The breeze lightly ruffled the fabric overhead . His footsteps were eerily silent . All eyes were on him . I le seemed to he moving unnaturally slowly , as if in a dream . That voluminously robed human I , nninated him completely . Ile started to wonder whether he wouldp236indeed prostrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling and his knees were shaking and his mind would n't quite focus on the question ; he saw the foot from a distance and could n't pull his attention away from it , and then without having realized that he was getting any closer he had reached the throne and the line of frowning warriors . Without making a decision , he sagged to his knees . The carpets absorbedthem soundlessly , and he rolled forward to rest half his weight on his hands . His eyes were riveted to the emperor 's bare foot , and his mind was a perfect blank except for the mental image of Blanc 's glare drilling a hole just under his solar helmet at the exact place where his spine connected to his skull . The bare foot disappeared into the folds of the garment , then winked out as the emperor flowed quickly off his low throne and leaped toward Rassam . Rassam 's body kept rolling forward , his elbows bending , his knees straightening , but just as his chest grazed the carpet he heard a sudden sharp sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imploring " No "  --  and felt the emperor 's strong hands on his shoulders pulling him back to his feet , and he knew the rifle shot had been the emperor 's desperate handclap . Back on his feet , the first thing Rassam saw was the warriors ' faces . Gabry 's was bending into fury . He was trying to lift his double-barreled pistol toward Rassam , but two other men were holding him back . Wolde was staring in disbelief at the emperor , and his jaw had dropped  --  for a fleeting instant , Rassam thought how it was the first time he 'd ever really seen a person 's jaw drop . The other faces were filled with rage , astonishment , worry , embarrassment . Theodore saw Rassam 's eyes flicker across the faces of his people , then turn to meet his own . For the first time in his life , he was glad of the awkward formal garment that hid his face . Even so , he was afraid Rassam would see from the attitude of his body , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was and how amazed at himself for the impulse to leave the throne and pull Rassam up . He threw all his effort into concealing his confusion , stepped slowly back until his calves touched the throne , and stood there forcing his hands to hang open and relaxed . He and Rassam stared at each other . Rassam had no idea what had just happened , and Theodore knew he would stand there without doing or saying anything until Theodore had given him a clue . Theodore lowered himself onto the throne in as dignified a manner as he could . " You are my friend , and you never have to prostrate yourself in my presence , " he whispered , struggling to keep his voice even . Rassam did n't move . There was a noise among the warriors , shallow breathing , a foot scraping across the carpet , a moist hand squeaking on a pistol butt , and there was a low , distinct curse from ( : abry . Theodore slashed his hand out viciously , and ( : ahry choked hack a second curse. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he was saying . " My friend John Bell once told me the Christians of England are not blessed with so many prophecies and visions as we Ethiopians are . At that time , I agreed with him that prophecies are a blessing . But now I think they are a curse . They haunt you every day of your life . They wo n't let you go for a single minute . They turn you into something less than a man . I hate the prophecies of my life , but I know they are true , and I have to follow them . " Rassam , I swear to you by everything holy that I 've never done anything without a good reason . I am not an evil man . I have never hurt anyone without a cause . I had a reason for imprisoning Cameron and Kerens . You must believe it hurt me to have to do it . I want you to forgive me for what I 've done to them . " There came that brittle sound from his warriors again , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was greater than he had imagined . Rassam started to raise his hand and step forward to comfort the emperor , but he caught himself in time . His words came out in a painful croak . " It is n't for me to forgive you , Your Majesty . I 'm not worthy to pass judgment on you . My opinion does n't matter . " " It matters , " said Theodore . " Forgive me . " Rassam shuffled his feet helplessly and did n't say anything . Theodore rose again . He felt numb , but he knew tears were gathering in his eyes . He started to take a step , could n't make his legs move . I le willed his body to throw itself onto the carpet at Rassam 's feet , but his body would n't cooperate . The men behind him did n't matter anymore , but his own pride was like a length of chain holding him back . Slowly , deliberately , he forced himself down to his knees . " For Christ 's sake , forgive me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once he threw himself onto his belly . Into the carpet he said , " Forgive Tire . " I le heard Rassam 's voice , fragile and quick , as if from a long distance . " Your Majesty , for everything , for anything , I forgive you . " Theodore lay face down for another unbelieving minute . Then he pushed himself up to his knees . Rassam had dropped down to his own knees , and they faced each other there . The tears welled out of Theodore'seyes . There were tear-streaks on Rassam 's cheeks , too , and Theodorerealized that this Mesopotamian was so utterly foreign to him that he could n't even guess why the man should cry . What had brought the tears to Rassam 's eyes was the sight of Theodorehumbled . Rassam did n't understand it all , but he was sure this hurnhling meant that another personal idol was about to let him down . Remembering Disraeli , he wept . Theodore could only think , over and over , Russo in is not the Light Bringer ! A weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized that he would have to repeat the whole agonizing process , watch for the signs in another man , once more approach his own death . Theodore stretched out his long arms and gathered Bassani intop238them . " You will forgive me ? " he asked , still not sure he 'd heard correctly . " I do , I do , Your Majesty , and I swear to you that I will do whatever I can to help you . If you write a letter to Queen Victoria , I will take it with me and personally see that it is acted upon . If you want engineers and workmen , I 'll see that they come to you . " Rassam seemed to be offering Theodore a way back to his path . For one short moment , Theodore dreamed he might be able to return to it , but in the next moment he knew he would not , and he knew what he must do . Rassam had not even had that moment of hope : even as he spoke , he had known how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away before the rains , " Theodore said , though both of them knew he was only saying that to fill in the terrible empty space before the inevitable happened . " But for a few more days , you will stay with me . " " I will , " said Rassam , and he felt the pit opening under his feet . Cameron and Kerens rejoined Rassam and Blanc at twilight of the next day . Blanc went halfway down the hill to greet them , but Rassam just sat in his camp chair and watched as Cameron led the weary procession up the hill to the British tents , dismounted , waved his hand to show the servants where to pitch his tent , and dropped without a word into a chair beside Rassam . He and Rassam did n't say anything or even look at each other . Cameron was already pulling at his beard and gazing northward across the lake . Silently , Dahon appeared with a pipe for Cameron and lit it with a glowing twig from the fire . Blanc and Kerens came up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 've been turned back , Mr. Rassam , " Blanc called ahead . Rassam had only told him the emperor 's version  --  that they would be sent down before the rains  --  and had n't told him the truth that both he and the emperor knew . Kerens and Blanc took chairs with the others , and Kerens accepted a glass of his favorite sherry from Dahon . " Show him the letter , " said Blanc , and Kerens handed a folded sheet of paper to Rassam . It had the single word Cameron in Arabic characters ; its red wax seal had been broken . Rassam unfolded it , turned so his body sheltered it from the wind and read aloud : " I have been angry with my friends and with those Englishmen who say , as it is reported to me , We depart for our country and are not yet reconciled with this emperor of the Ethiopians . ' Until I consult what I will do , therefore , I have given orders to my people to take hold of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to hurt you . I am sorry . Be of good cheer . " " Gibberish , " spat out Blanc . " Damned savage . Lunatic . " Ile looked for agreement to Kerens , but the young Irishman was just enjoying his sherry.  |p239Cameron  set a file of perfect smoke rings marching between Blanc and Kerens . " They 've excellent tobacco here in Ethiopia , " said Rassam , very softly . " Aye , more flavorsome than at home , " said Cameron , though his mind was obviously not on his words . Rassam remembered how Cameronhad boasted about the heroic things he had done as a young man , hut Rassam could n't picture him as anything but the broken shell of a man he was at this moment . Have you any idea what the emperor is planning ? " demanded Blanc . Rassam considered telling Blanc the entire truth , but instead he said , At the moment , he is under pressure . To let us go is to lose face with his own people . To keep us is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering what to do . " " Then it 's maybe back to Magdala , " laughed Kerens . His humor was genuine , completely out of harmony with everyone else . " I 'll be a hundred years old before I 'm ever back to Londonderry . " Cameron pulled his gaze in from the lake , glanced quickly at Kerens , .10 ( 1 said in a cruel tone that Kerens did n't seem to notice , " At least you should have your beard by then . " " I should , " said Kerens . " I say , are those the emperor 's tents ? " Withouta glance at Dahon , he held out his glass for the Goan to refill . A wide , gentle saddle connected their hill with the next . Beyond this next hill was the lake . The saddle was empty except for a few stray goats . The hilltop was covered with the emperor 's tents and people , and his lion banner flew above everything . Blanc turned to Cameron , saw the clear hopelessness , gave up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry much about being turned back , " he said . " Mr. Rassam has things well under control . " " I las he ? " asked Kerens . " Ile had an audience yesterday with the emperor and wrapped him around his little finger . It was a miracle of diplomacy . The emperor called Mr. Rassam into his presence . Samuel whispered that Mr. Rassam would have to prostrate himself and kiss the bloody emperor 's foot . I said no , no envoy of the British Queen could ever humble himself like t 1 1 ; lt . If you can imagine , that cheeky old African and I had an argument about it , right there under the emperor 's awning . But Mr. Rassam never had a second thought : he walked right up to the emperor , and threw himself onto his knees . " " Wrapped him around his little finger , you said ? " Bassani avoided Kerens 's eyes . " Right onto his knees , " Blanc went on . " I was humiliated . But the emperor leaped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and told hiln ill front of everyone that Mr Rassam should never have to humble himself before anyone . And then the emperor threw himself onto thep240ground , right on his belly , and begged Mr. Rassam to forgive him for everything he 's done to you and Captain Cameron . Mr. Rassam refused to forgive him , the emperor begged again , and Mr. Rassam finally relented and forgave him . Mr. Rassam knew what he was doing all along . He played the emperor like a lyre . " " Just excellent , Mr. Rassam , " said Kerens . " My congratulations , sir . " " The emperor may be considering what to do , but surely that 's only to save a little of his own face before he lets us go , " said Blanc . " Mr. Rassam can steer him in any direction he likes . " Blanc had been so secure in his own vision of what had happened that he had n't noticed Rassam had n't said a word about it . The constant praise had hurt Rassam as badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bluntly , " I hate to disappoint you , Henry , but you do n't understand . Theodore is considering what to do , but he does n't actually have any choice . He ca n't let us go . We 'll all be at Magdala , just as soon as he makes up his mind . And as a matter of fact I did honestly try to humble myself before him , but he would n't let me . " Rassam turned to Cameron . " We 've both tried to humble ourselves , " he said , " but he would n't accept either of us . Neither of us is the right man , and we 'll stay here until the right man comes . " Again to Blanc , " He was n't asking forgivenessfor past crimes and insults . He was asking forgiveness in advance for what he 's going to do . " " You 're saying we 'll be imprisoned ? " asked Blanc . Rassam nodded , and Cameron whispered , " You 're in prison already . " " Do something about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , " said Rassam . " You 've given up hope ? " " There is no hope . " " Use your diplomatic skills . Is n't that your job ? " Very slowly , very softly , Rassam said , " I could n't sway him . He has no choice . Besides , he terrifies me . " Kerens stifled a laugh . Blanc stood up and looked across at the emperor 's tents . His narrow back was to Rassam . " You 've let me down , " he said . " You 've betrayed me . To himself , so quietly that Blanc could n't hear , Rassam said , " I know the meaning of betrayal , too . " The emperor 's tent city remained in the same location along the southern shore of Lake Tana for the next two months . According to Samuel , this was almost unheard of : the tent city normally traveled every week , or every two weeks at the very longest . From the hilltop Rassam saw the emperor three or four times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an escort passed directly below the British hill . Rassam sat in his camp chair and watched him go by , only forty yards away , but the emperor did n't look up . ilassam received nop241messages or gifts , and Samuel seemed just as confused about what the emperor was doing as the rest of them . They had perfect freedom to walk or ride anywhere in the tent city , and Blanc and Kerens sometimes hunted several miles beyond the line of sentries , but they were so far inside Ethiopia and so recognizable that they might as well have been in chains . Rassam was almost alone during these two months . Blanc never said a word to him and would n't even sit near him . All his newfound vitality , humor , and strength had been erased by that one betrayal . Kerens did n't care very much about Rassam , but Blanc forced the young Irishmanto make a choice between Blanc and Rassam , and there was no question of whom it had to be . Rassam did n't count this as much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be his only good point : he was n't very bright , and he never had an opinion on anything . I'Iiere were even times when Rassam saw a fleeting look of irritation on Blanc 's face , and Rassam was sure it was becoming an effort for Blanc to put up with his insipid friend . Cameron had no complaint with Rassam , but he was in no condition to be company . He spent his days sitting in a chair staring at the lake . He ate very little , coughed up bloody phlegm into an old rag , and grunted when someone talked to him . He was a man utterly without hope , and Rassam did n't expect him to live much longer . The first driving torrent of the rainy season came in the middle of May , nearly a month early . Before this there had always remained the feeblest chance that they might be allowed to leave ; now the rains would seal off the country for the next six months , and there was no hope left . That first rain came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punched through the blue sky , the lake surface churned into white foam , and the first drops made hand-sized craters in the dust on their hilltop . The rain lasted throughout the morning . By noon , they were outside the tent in their usual seating arrangements , but now their hilltop was an island connected to the emperor 's by a narrow isthmus . By late afternoon , a man could wade from one hill to the next . There was some activity in the emperor 's compound . A group of the emperor'speople came onto the saddle just below the emperor 's cornpoundand spent half an hour setting up a peculiar lavender-colored tent , very small , open on the side facing the British camp , with carpets for a floor but without any carpets outside , and without an awning . The lion banner went up at one corner , and the emperor 's throne and signs of rule disappeared inside . " What is it ? " Rassam asked Samuel , who was squatting nearby and watching . " It is the emperors judgment tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is trying the caws of criminals . Today , he will try a group of whel chieftains from Tigr6 . As he ordered , the common warriors werep242disarmed and sent home , and the leaders have been brought to him for judgment . " " What will he do with them ? " " That is n't for an old man to say . That is up to His Majesty . But in the past he has scolded them fiercely . A scolding from the emperor is a fearsome thing . His voice in anger can curl a man 's hair , or loosen his bowels , or make his penis fall off . I 've never actually seen a man 's penis fall off , but I 've talked to others who have . And after he has scolded them , he makes them promise to be loyal to him , and he sets them free . If a man is brought to trial a second time , he will likely be set free again , and if he is brought to trial a third time , he will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy , is it not ? " " It is , " said Rassam . " Look , there are the prisoners . " Rassam followed Samuel 's pointing finger , and saw a troop of warriors on horseback come splashing up toward the saddle . In their midst walked six men , looking half naked without their weapons . Their braids had been loosened , and they dragged their ankle-chains through the wet grass . They reached the lavender tent , and all of them , prisoners and escort together , squatted on the ground . The prisoners did not seem particularly worried . Cameron was staring at the lake , but the other Britishers were all watching the rare activity . At the end of an hour , the Ethiopians at the lavender tent were growing visibly restless , but none of them had moved . At last men began to scurry among the emperor 's tents on the hilltop . Rassam recognized several of the emperor 's key people . Gabry came down to the lavender tent with a long brown whip coiled in one hand . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he was too far away for Rassam to hear any of it . He let the whip uncoil onto the ground . It was twelve feet long , as thick as a man 's wrist at one end , tapering to the width of a little finger and blossoming into a flower of loose thongs . Gabry lashed out with a subtle , effortless motion , and the whip ripped through the air and boomed as loud as gunfire . He cracked it five or six times , then coiled it up and squatted comfortably among the warriors . Before Rassam could ask , Samuel said , as if he were eager that Rassam should n't get the wrong impression , " It is a hippopotamus-hide whip , very dangerous . The tip can easily kill a man ; the rough edge can rip one 's flesh open . But it is only an ancient symbol of the emperor 's power of life and death . It is never used , at least not by this emperor . There is a proverb in Ethiopia . It is very ancient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever before . In Amharic it is , Negus kamotu baman yimmaggotu . In Arabic something close to , When the emperor dies , whom can one ask for justice ? " Wolde was on the hilltop near the emperor 's own tent . 1 It ' conferred seriously with a tall turbaned Ethiopian whom Ilassain had never no/tired before : " Engeddah , one of the Twelve , " Samuel answered , in reply to his question . Wolde went into the emperor 's tent , came out again to talk more with Engeddah , then re-entered the tent . People swirled around on the hilltop , and Rassam had the very distinct , definitelyuncomfortable feeling of a ritual gone wrong . It seemed as if an everyday routine , one that everyone knew by heart , had been suddenly complicated , and no one knew exactly how to deviate from the tradi-t ional way of doing things . Finally , Wolde and Theodore emerged into the fine gray daylight . Theodore towered two full heads above his little eunuch priest . He wore his usual white trousers and shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head mounted on a silver shaft with golden tassels at t lie head and at the butt . The emperor 's other hand lay heavily on Wolde 's shoulder . They walked toward the lavender tent . Engeddah started to walk with them , but Wolde , with an almost furtive gesture , waved him off . Engeddah and a small body of scribes and bodyguards followed them at a few paces ' distance . Theodore 's steps were leaden , and he swayed as he walked . Wolde struggled under the weight of his emperor . Samuel had watched them when they came out of the tent , but now his head was lowered and he was covering his eyes with one hand . It was Blanc who said in a loud voice to Kerens , " I believe he 's tipsy , " and then called in Arabic to Samuel , " Has His Majesty been drinking ? " Samuel looked up at Blanc and said weakly , " I 've been here . I have n't seen him . " Blanc sniffed and directed his attention back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " How long has he been this way ? " When Samuel lifted his head , Rassam saw tears streaking through the ( lusty creases of the old man 's cheeks . " I am humiliated , " Samuel said . " You should have known him when he was younger . He was a lion . " He lowered his head so Rassam could n't see the tears . " Wolde told me to tell you everything , in hopes you know more than we , but I was too shamed to speak . He has been drinking today since the rain began this morning . Wolde was with him . At the first drops , he stepped out of his tent and felt the drops on his palms and said , So , our fates are sealed . ' Wolde did n't understand what he meant . " The rain , " Rassam said . Rassam 's emotions had been stretched so t ightly for so long that the rain had n't meant anything to him . All he felt was pity for Theodore , nothing at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it impossible for him to let us go . Now , he is committed to keeping us here as prisoners . How has he been these last two ( months ? " Very had , " said Samuel . " Moody . Depressed . I he prays alone late into the night . I Iv has been drinking sometimes , once or twice a week . " Violence ? '  |p244A  long pause , and then a whisper : " You know about those horrors ? " " His Majesty told me himself . " " Master Rassam , he has n't hurt anyone yet . But Wolde is worried that he may . Anything might set him off  --  or nothing at all . " " I have n't got a solution , " said Rassam . " He 's a cornered man . I feel sorry for him . " " I , too , " said Samuel . " It is not an easy thing to be emperor . " Wolde and Theodore had reached the lavender tent . Theodore disappeared inside , and Wolde remained outside with everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent 's open side , away from Wolde . He snapped his hippopotamus-hide whip twice to get everyone 's attention , then shouted out a short speech . The British heard the whip clearly , but were too far away to catch Gabry 's words . It had begun to rain , and Dahon draped a blanket over Rassam 's shoulders . In answer to Gabry 's shout , one of the prisoners got to his feet and shuffled forward . He dropped to his hands and knees , crawled the last yards to the lavender tent , and then pushed himself up into a kneeling position facing it . The British were watching a pantomime . Rassam called for his telescope . The kneeling prisoner was listening to the emperor . Several times , apparently in answer to questions , he himself spoke . His head bobbed when he talked , but his hands stayed rigidly at his sides . Finally he simply knelt there on the wet ground with his head bowed and listened to the emperor . Through the telescope Rassam could easily detect the cringing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Gabry cracked his whip . Two of the emperor 's men helped the prisoner to a low boulder . He sat straddling the stone while the men chiseled at his ankle-chains . When they had fallen off the man rubbed his ankles gratefully and rejoined the others . His entire trial had lasted ten minutes . Gabry cracked the whip again and called for another prisoner . As far as Rassam could tell through his telescope , this man 's trial was identical to the first . So was the third . All ended with stone , hammer , and chisel . A hard rain from the lake was extending past the shoreline . It had drenched the fourth prisoner 's clothing , so that his black skin showed through the fabric . This man was different . He was hardly bigger than Wolde , but even with his ankle-chains on he had a way of swaggering as he walked . When he crawled forward on his hands and knees , it was n't a humbling action . He had n't learned from the example of the others . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a meeting between two excessively proud men . The man knelt at the proper place , but instead of listening with bowed head to the emperor , he began to talk . He gestured sharply with his hands , and once he even raised his palm as if he were ' ordering the emperor to be quiet and listen.  | " He 's trying to defend himself , " Samuel muttered . " The fool . " He turned his head toward Rassam . " There is no defense in a trial before the emperor , " he said . " There is only the submitting and the forgiveness . " And Samuel lowered his head and began to pray in a rapid , musical voice . " Go ahead , tell the bastard a thing or two , " It was Kerens 's voice , aimed at the prisoner . Blanc echoed him : " Tell the bastard . " From out of the emperor 's sight , Wolde clapped his hands to get the prisoner 's attention . The prisoner turned his head . Wolde waved his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head , looked back at Theodore , and kept on gesturing and talking . Gabry , at the other side of the lavender tent , was watching eagerly , like a cat eying a bird . His whip snaked back and forth a few inches above the ground . Suddenly , the prisoner put his palms on the ground and used them to push himself up to his feet . His ankle-chains tripped him . He went down in a heap , and rose halfway up again . Plunging out of the tent , Theodore was just a blur of white at the top edge of the telescope lens . The ceremonial spear was in both hands , like a medieval fighting staff . He smashed the silver spear shaft like a club into the prisoner 's back . The man skidded on his face through the slick grass . Wolde reached for the spear . Theodore slashed around at him without looking , and Wolde went down . Theodore took a step toward the prisoner , but Wolde scrambled after him and threw himself into Theodore'slegs from behind . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spear over his head and brought it down in a silent arc . It hit Wolde 's upper arm , just above the elbow . Wolde tried to crawl away . Theodore turned and found the prisoner , curled into a ball . Theodore shouted at Gabry , and the whip flashed out . The flower-tip touched the man 's shoulder blade , a delicate caress . It opened the man 's back deep into the muscles . The man leaped up . Gabry swung the whip again . The edge touched the man 's side between his ribs and his hip . It dug into the soft flesh like a rip-saw . Through the telescope Rassam saw the broad band of frayed , bloody cloth , as if the man had been cut in half . The man turned a full circle as he fell onto his knees , balanced there for five more seconds , then collapsed onto his face and lay still . Seen through the lens from such a distance , with the rain and the deepening twilight and the silence , it seemed just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolde in the telescope . The arm was hanging off at an unnatural angle , and the sleeve was already soaked through with a pink mixture of blood and rain . Engeddah sat helplessly beside him . Rassam pulled his eye away from the telescope . Samuel was lying face him on the ground . His arms were outstretched , and his hands werep246pulling up tufts of grass . Blanc , emotionless as ever , was on his feet , craning his neck as if that would help him see . Kerens was sitting in his camp chair , calmly sipping his sherry , ignoring the rainwater dripping off his solar helmet into his lap , shielding the sherry from the rain with his hand . Cameron had n't noticed that anything was happening . The prisoners and warriors were a roiling crowd of men . They had all surged to their feet at once , but some had slipped in the mud or tripped on their chains . Rassam saw Theodore running through the middle of the crowd , waving his ceremonial spear and shouting . Prisonersand warriors alike tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know exactly what to do . Theodore spun and shouted orders . He pointed at a man , one of the prisoners he had already pardoned . A warrior pushed the man 's chest , and the man , not struggling , only stunned , let himself float backward onto the ground . More warriors grasped one of his arms . A sword went up and came down . The warriors let go the arm , and the man waved a bloody stump . The warriors were experienced at their task . They went at it quickly : the other hand , a foot , the other . The mutilated man lay still . Rassam could see his ribs rising , falling , rising , breathing desperately . The other two prisoners whose chains had been removed tried to run . One was too deep inside the crowd , and a sword stroke chopped him down . The other made it into the open . He sprinted down the hill , high-stepping , his feet sending back sprays of water , with Theodore and two other warriors in pursuit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fell , then was up and running , but he had lost his lead . Theodore cocked his spear arm back , dug one foot into the ground , and let his momentum carry him through a high-armed javelin throw . Rassam followed the spear 's trajectory in his telescope . The point made contact with the man 's bottom rib , just beside the spine . Thrown down by the force of the blow , he pitched forward immediately , landing on the hillside . He glided over a steep drop and plunged out of sight . The three other ankle-chained prisoners waited passively among the warriors . They were thrown down and their hands and feet cut off . Theodore stood above the little drop in the hillside and looked down at the man he had killed . After a minute , he sank to his knees and raised his head to look out at the lake . His people watched but did not approach him , and he was still kneeling there alone when night fell . Inside Rassam 's tortured dream , drops of water splattered against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and danced around . He smelled rancid butter , and the sour reek of tej . Ile heard the muffled nonsense sounds , very close . The water drops kept splattering , but now they were cold ; they dripped down his chin to gather in a pool in the hollow of his neck . There was a light pressure on his chest , and water rushing in the far distance . It was not a dream . Ilep247lay in the darkness of the tent , gripping the edge of his Smyrna rug tight in his hands , feeling the pulse in his neck on both sides of the pool of water . He had no way of knowing how many minutes passed this way . At last , he pried two fingers loose from the rug and stretched them out to explore the darkness . Half an inch , and the nails encountereda solid object , cloth-covered , soaking wet , cold . An arm . The pressure on his chest , a hand . Ile put his hand up , found the shoulder , traced the bristly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly he was n't sure whether he actually made a sound , Rassam whispered , " Theodore . " The hand pressed harder on his chest , then pulled away entirely . Ilassam sat up in bed , reached out with his hands , and made contact with the man again . " Your Majesty , " he said . There was no response . Rassam slid past the man and fumbled around in the dark until he found a candle and a box of matches . The moisture on the ceiling and walls glittered in the candlelight . I lead bowed , Theodore was kneeling beside Rassam 's low arat . His braids had come loose in the rain and fell below his shoulders to the carpet . Rassam sat on the carpet and watched him . Finally , Theodore raised his head . His eyes were lifeless , his lips a straight line . " Someone is always watching me , " he said . " Always , always . " All the emotion had been drained from his voice . He spoke a few sentences in Amharic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " A favor . I need a favor . " 1 e paused , as if he were trying to recapture his train of thought , and Rassam said , " What favor ? " A brief light crossed Theodore 's face . " Wolde . My people ca n't do anything for him . They think he 'll die . " His voice trailed off into emptinessagain . Rassam asked , " Do you want Dr. Blanc to see him ? " Theodore nodded his head slowly . He might have said " Blanc , " but a gust of rain-filled wind gripped the tent at the same moment and muffled the sound . " I 'll go for him , " said Rassam . He dashed out of the tent . A quick , unexpected movement caught his eye immediately . He gasped and looked . Between Blanc 's tent and that of Kerens , four men were standing close together in the rain , staring at him . In the dim light , and as terrified as he was , Rassam could only see one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coiled in his hands . The rain had molded his white clothing to his body , and he appeared to be emaeiatecl . His face was a puzzle of grays and blacks , but there was no mistaking the hatred in it . The three men behind him were just shadows . They did n't move , and at last Hassan ' turned away and strode deliberately to ! italic 's tent . He had n't brought a candle , so he had to grope through the blacknessp248until he found Blanc 's arat . He shook Blanc gently . Blanc murmured , then leaned up on his elbow and asked , " Laurence ? " " No , it 's me , " said Rassam . Those were practically the first words he 'd spoken to Blanc in two months . Blanc did n't respond , so Rassam rushed on : " The emperor is in my tent . He says the Ethiopian doctors ca n't help Wolde . " " Murderer . " Blanc spat the word out . " The bloody savage . " " Not for Theodore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blanc was silent , but Rassam could feel cold anger flowing from him . " It 's vital , " said Rassam . He let himself beg . " Please , Henry . Please do it . " He nearly choked on the unfamiliar name . Using it was more humbling than anything he had done in Ethiopia . At last , in the haughtiest voice Rassam had ever heard , Blanc said , " For the priest , then , Mr. Rassam . But I 'll not have anything to do with the emperor . " " Theodore 's in my tent . Just dress and walk straight to his camp , and you wo n't see him at all . " Rassam backed out . He went to the servants ' tent and woke Dahon , who hurried out to accompany Blanc across the saddle . On the way back to his own tent , Rassam glanced again at the shelteredalcove between Blanc 's tent and Kerens ' . The men were still there , motionless , glaring . Rassam plunged through the flap into his tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The emperor was at the far end of the tent , almost outside the candle 's hard yellow light . He was lying on his side in a fetal position , exactly like the prisoner before Gabry had whipped him to death . His loose hair was a wide black halo around his head . Rassam laid a blanket over him . He did n't seem to notice , though his eyes were open . In the half minute that Rassam hovered over him , the eyes did n't blink . Rassam sat cross-legged on his arat and watched Theodore all through that long , rainy night . Theodore 's self-pity did n't diminish Rassam 's feeling of the emperor 's majesty . It was fitting , he thought , that a man so far above other men , so aloof and emotionless , should break down so much harder than a mortal man . Rassam himself knew no emotions that long night  --  no fear , no sympathy , not even the familiar sense of betrayal . After the first few minutes , he only knew boredom . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried softly . Once , in the middle of a crying spell , he raised his head and said , " I ca n't let you stay near me , Rassam . I 'm afraid I 'll hurt you . " Later , he said in a voice so smooth and rational that it chilled Rassam , " I used to hear I was called a madman for the things I did , but I never believed it before . Now , I think I really must be mad . But I still understandsome things clearly . I 've never meant harm to anyone . Whatever evil I do , I 've got no choice . There is always a purpose . I have to do it . I have to . " And then again , he said , " One clay I think you will see mep249dead , and while you stand over my corpse it may be that you will curse You may say , This was a wicked man who should n't be buried . Let his remains rot above the ground . ' But I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When morning had turned the yellow light into a soft blue , Theodore finally pulled himself up . He waddled on his knees to Rassam and wrapped his arms around him. lie whispered , " Do you understand me ? " Rassam answered , " Yes . " Theodore asked , " Do you forgive me ? " and Rassam said , " Yes . " Theodore said , " Do not be afraid . " He turned quickly and ducked through the tent flap . Rassam went outside , sat in his camp chair near the fire , and took a ip of coffee from Samuel . He watched Theodore climb the saddle , now unnaturally empty , and enter his own tent . Later in the morning , a dozen warriors appeared on the next hill h hind the British camp . Rassam had never seen any of them before . Hie leader dismounted , waded through the marshy low ground between the hills , and walked up the hill to Rassam . He salaamed gracefully , and spoke in an exaggeratedly respectful tone . " Excuse theibteerruption , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no choice but to bother you . I have orders from His Majesty to escort you to the amba Iagdala . How soon can you be ready to travel ? " " This afternoon , " said Rassam.  |p250I'almerston  's Whigs won the general election of 1865 , but " Old Pam " died late in the year . Lord Russell succeeded him as prime minister , but Ile lacked the spark to follow the great man . Gladstone , waiting pa-t iently in the Exchequer for his own chance to rule , could n't save him . The government fell over the Reform Bill , and in June of ' 66 , almost . it the same instant that Rassam was having the leg irons pounded tight around his ankles , the Whigs resigned . Queen Victoria asked the Earl of Derby and her beloved Disraeli to try to form a minority government . Derby became prime minister , Disraeli took the Exchequer , and I ) crby 's son , Lord Stanley , took over the Foreign Office . These Tories were the party of social reform , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of imperialism . Where the Whigs had been cautious about Ethiopia , Derby and Disraeli would have sent in an army at once , but even they had to admit this was n't the moment for a war . England was consumed by more urgent problems : riots over the Reform Bills , war between Prussia and Austria , financial crisis in the City , cattle plague in the English countryside . Tory control of English politics was tenuous ; the situation was perilous , and they had been out of power so long their courage was blunted . They sent two mild letters to Ethiopia through a certain Red Sea merchant , a Greek named Paniotti who had offered his broad commercial contacts to Colonel Merewether in Aden . There was no reply . At last , after fourteen months of delay , they had sharpened their courage and were ready to act.  |p252The  Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs to His Majesty Theodore , King of Ethiopia . Many months have now elapsed since the Queen , my Sovereign , on the 4th of October 1866 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by command of Her Majesty , on the 16th of April of this year , appealed to Your Majesty in order to obtain the release from the captivity in which they have for a long period been most unjustifiably held , of officers sent to your Court on public matters . But Your Majesty has disregarded these successive appeals , has made light of the remonstrances and representations of the Queen , and has rejected the friendly overtures which have so repeatedly been made to you by Her Majesty 's command . It is impossible for the Queen any longer to endure such conduct on the part of Your Majesty , and Her Majesty has , therefore , given orders that a military force should without delay enter your dominions and obtain from you by force a concession which you have hitherto withheld from friendly representations . For the result of this measure , whatever may be the consequences of it to your throne and to your country , Your Majesty can alone be held responsiblethroughout the civilised world ; and , although the Queen would fain hope that , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen to words of peace , and avert by full and immediate concession the attack which in a short pace of time will be directed against you , I am commanded by the Queen to warn Your Majesty that the course of action which I now make known to you is irrevocably determined on , and that the only means of preserving your country from war , and your own power from overthrow , will be found in the delivery to the commander of the British invading army of all European prisoners in your keeping ; and it is the earnest desire of the Queen that this last opportunity which Her Majesty offers to you may be taken advantage of by Your Majesty , and that peace may be so preserved between England and Ethiopia . Having thus fulfilled the command of my Sovereign , I bid Your Majesty heartily farewell . Your sincere friend , StanleyBy this time , the invasion belonged to Robert Napier . The elegant , elaborate plans over which he had labored were designed in such a way that no man without Napier 's engineering expertise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man would require a complete revision , which could take months . Nor had Napier neglected the politics of war . The Whigs had seemed firmly entrenched in power , but Napier , ever methodical , ever thorough , had not ignored Disraeli and his Tory compatriots . It had n't been hard to cultivate them , since their vulnerability was obvious . They were the party of imperialism , and though he was an apolitical man , he easily convinced them that he stood for everythingp253in which they believed . When an invasion was at last being decided on , curious assortment of politicians and civil servants and military men , Whigs and Tories and Radicals , were surprised to discover that they all favored him . On the same day that Stanley sent his ultimatum to Paniotti , he sent Napier orders to make final estimates and to begin preparing for war . To Napier , it was just a confirmation of something he had known for two years . European warfare was changing . The technology of war was growing vastly more sophisticated , while the administrative machinery needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom still refused to admit it , the most successful general was the one with the firmest grasp of logistics . Napier , the ideal military mind for his time , sat down at his desk and prepared the most deliberate war in history . Never had the military generated such extensive , elaborate paperwork . It dealt with the transcendent and the mundane , the macrocosm and the microcosm . As if invisible strands of steel-hard spiders ' web connectedthese great heaps of paper in Bombay to the real world , thousandsof men in all parts of the globe were set into frenzied activity . There were to be four thousand European and nine thousand Indian troops . Sir Robert chose most from his own Bombay regiments , but as a gesture of goodwill to the other Indian presidencies he included one brigade each from Calcutta and Karachi , two companies of Madras Sappers from Calicut , and a regiment from Vingorla . The Royal Navy was n't to be excluded , either . There was going to be a brigade of rockt'teersfrom the navy , and Captain Fellowes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . European officers and soldiers were considered too valuable to do anything but fight , so their servants had to be included , as well as muleteers and camel drivers , railroad gangs and laborers , Indians , Persians , Egyptians , and Chinese . The estimatesquickly rose to thirty-two thousand men and fifty-five thousand animals . To transport the army and its equipment , the British hired two hundredsailing vessels and seventy-five steamers from India and England and points between . Each officer was to have two servants , a khansamah to watch after him and a syce to watch after his horse . Each white soldier was issued seven pairs of socks , two pairs of boots , a solar helmet , a cholera belt , and a canteen . Each regiment of Sikhs was to have eight hundred pounds of borax and a similar amount of ghee to wash and dress their waist-length hair , this specified amounts of rum and opium . ' There were to be forty-four trained elephants to carry the heavy guns and to terrify the Ethiopians . ' They required two specially converted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed in compartments that had been reinforced with shingle and stone . During a cyclone inp254Calcutta harbor , they proved just how devastating a seasick elephant can be . Hiring commissions were dispatched to the Mediterranean and the Near East to arrange for mules and camels and men to handle them . Animals and men from as far away as Spain and Persia began to convergeon the Red Sea . The first reconnaissance by Merewether and Phayre had been in October , 1865 . They arrived on the western Red Sea coast again in October 1867 . Their original impressions were confirmed : barren , hot , unappealing , but plenty of potable water . They made a firm decision on Zula , a derelict village on the site of the ancient Greek settlement of Adulis , as their port . A contingent of Indian Sappers , plus several thousand Chinese coolies , had come with them . They off-loaded a few thousand tons of suppliesand equipment , and then set to work . Within three weeks , they had built a seven-hundred-yard-long pier to make a connection to deepdraftocean-going vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginnings of a railroad from the shore to the escarpment . In early November , three things happened in rapid succession . First , Africa fought back . Merewether and Phayre had n't been aware that October was the end of the highland rainy season . The wells that were so adequate in October dried up in November . The coast grew miserablyhot . Dust devils twirled through Zula . Great blankets of sand driven by gale force winds came down from the north . Second , the officers left . Merewether went up to Suru to begin distributingto the native chiefs a proclamation that stated the purpose of the invasion and promised not to interfere with peaceable Ethiopians . Phayre went up to scout the route . Every other officer who had enough rank to order someone else to cover for him invented an immediate task that demanded his presence in the cool , healthy , water-rich highlands . They migrated en masse , and eager , inexperienced young subalterns took over the army 's base camp . Third , the army began to pour into Zula . Ships off-loaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized their men and the listless laborers , then summed up the situation and started after Merewether and Phayre . Thousands of mules were set loose on the beach . The first muleteers in Zula had been recruited from the slums of Bombay and Calcutta , and most of them had never handled a mule before . The mules wandered around for a few days , and then they began to drop from thirst . A system had just been devised for feeding and watering them when fever struck . Mules and horses frothed at the mouth for an hour or two , then they fell , trembled , and died . There were no veterinarians ashore , and the Indians , pleading the laws of their religion , refused to help clear away the rotting carcasses . Their stink , combined with the stink from the undisciplined sanitary habits of the men , was awesome.  |p255One  night an unusually high tide washed up and damaged supplies on the beach . A subaltern ordered that the supplies be moved farther from the water , and then as a further precaution supervised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones on the shoreward side of the supplies . On the night his creation was finished , an unseasonable deluge flowed down the escarpment . The entire desert was covered with half an inch of water , reflecting the stars . The flood backed up three feet deep behind the dike that was supposed to prevent the flow of water from the opposite direction . Thousands more tons of supplies were ruined , along with the pride and hopes of one young subaltern , who , through the honor of British officers , remained forever anonymous , though never forgotten . Napier 's second-in-command , Major-General Sir Charles Staveley , reached Zula in early December . As his steamer chugged up to the pier , Staveley overheard the whispered remark of the French army observer , Captain d'Henrecourt , to the French naval observer , **26;8656;TOOLONG : " Encore la Crimee ! " Staveley said nothing . What faced him was definitely reminiscent of the Crimea , though it was different in its own , African way . There was a low , shimmering , bone-white shoreline , and , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier , and another half done . The Hadas River was merely a wide depression in the sand , without even a trickle of water . The troops were camped north of the river , their dusty tents set up at random and interspersed haphazardly with storage depots . South of the river the Chinese coolies had erected low bowerlike shelters , piled high with branches and blankets . For all its meanness , it had a more homelike permanence than the camp across the river . The first stage of the railroad led through the middle of their encampment . No work was going on , neither on the railroad or anywhere else in sight . During the following weeks , Staveley 's strong hand forced order from the chaos . The second pier , nine hundred yards long , was completed , and a third was started . Condensers were set up on the ends of the piers and connected through long pipes to holding tanks on the shore . They added one thousand tons of water per week to the ten thousand being brought by steamer from Aden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the ten miles of salt desert to the mountains . A telegraph line already ran from Suakin to Khartoum to Cairo , and from Cairo to England . Sappers tried to run a line from Zula to Suakin , but they had to give up when white ants ate the poles . The English and Indian tents were moved into straight rows , all facing the same direction . Sanitary regulations were announced and strictly enforced . The only place for bathing was off the piers at low tide , when the shallow water forced the ships to stand off in deeper water . At those dines , pink-skinned generals and colonels wallowed and splashed alongsideCockney artillerymen and Irish foot soldiers . Mules and horsesp256were fed and watered immediately upon reaching shore , and then packed and sent forward up to Suru . They struggled up the escarpment on their sea-weary legs , but at least they were spared the fever and the thirst , and most of them survived . Once things were under control in Zula , Staveley turned his attention to the approach to Ethiopia . Phayre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Suru was steep in places , but not too difficult . What Staveley found was one of the most treacherous trails he 'd ever seen , often less than ten feet wide , hemmed in by vertical cliffs . For a single man on a horse , if the man were willing to dismount and lead the horse through the hardest places , it was n't too difficult . But for an elephant , an artillery battery , a supply cart , or a file of a thousand men , it was impossible . With two months already invested in Zula , Staveley could not abandon it and search for another route : he ordered the Sappers into action . They began blasting paths through solid granite and leveling the steepest places with ramps of gravel and mud . By New Year 's Zula had taken on the appearance of an established army camp : boring , homelike , disciplined . Upon being pushed into motion , the ponderous , efficient British military machine could n't help but be what Napier expected . The machine was building up momentum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling . It was noon on the sixth of January , 1868 . The blazing sun set the entire salt desert shimmering . Great ranks of troops , blocked off into rectangles by the color of their tunics  --  scarlet , blue , green , black  --  and by their headgear  --  turbans , solar helmets , puggrees , waist-length black hair  --  stood and sweated on the beach . Cavalry maneuvered on the plain beyond the Zula camp . Pennants fluttered . Trumpets , bagpipes , and elephants blared . At a secret signal big guns fired a distant salute from the base of the Ethiopian escarpment . The commander-in-chief had arrived to take over personal control of his expedition . Rocketeer Arthur Pilbeam stood at close attention in the first rank of the naval rocket brigade aboard the steamer Octavia . Like his companionshe wore the sailor 's uniform that had been modified for those seamen who were going to march into Ethiopia , and across his shoulder he held a sun-hot metal rocket tube . He felt well-fed and rested after six weeks of special training in Aden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Fellowes was directly in front of Pilbeam , at a right angle to his rocketeers . Fellowes 's chin was tucked down so hard that it had disappeared into his chest , and his body was so perfectly straight and rigid that a strong gust would have toppled him like a tree . Pilbeam studied the African coast . Underneath all the display and pageantry , it was Africa and nothing else . Ile knew the continent well , from all the years he 'd skirted it , from Alexandria to Gibraltar , the Gold Coast to the Cape , Mombasa to Aden to Suez . But he 'd never pene/trated more than ten miles , and to him the interior was nothing but a mystery : he supposed it was all mountains , deserts , and jungles , all Boers and Berbers and Blacks . He 'd never been much interested . The only thing about the interior that was important to him was that the envoy was somewhere on the other side of the mountains . In the two years since Massawa , Pilbeam had carefully refined his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just outside his body , at rest like one of the rockets still in the tube he carried , but already connected by invisible wires through the air and past the horizonto its target . It hovered in silence , waiting for those wires to pull it skyward , waiting to fly , streaming sparks like a piece of metal dragged fast along a cobblestone street , waiting to explode over the envoy 's head . When the envoy had come aboard to take the Dalhousie 's marines ashore to free some slaves Pilbeam had been in the engine room shovelingcoal . The engine room was n't his usual assignment , but he had had to replace an injured sailor . It had been painful to be that close , and yet not to see the envoy . He had made Hoyt tell him every detail , over and over , until Hoyt refused to talk about it anymore . It seemed to be fate at work , then , when Captain Easterday announced the call for volunteers to learn to fire the new rockets , in order to join an overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised when he was selected to represent the Dalhousie : fate had willed it so . Hoyt tried to reason with his friend , but Pilbeam would not be moved . For the first time in two years , Pilbeam would n't even talk about the envoy . Hoyt watched sadly as his friend hoisted his sea bag onto his shoulder and clumped down the gangplank onto the Aden pier . Pilbeam stood at attention among the ninety-eight sailors who were to march to Ethiopia , and who were expected to terrify the natives with their rockets , bursting like exploding stars high up in the air . The other sailors were proud of their unusual weapons and their special training , their new uniforms , their role in this monumental event . They were even glad to be part of a band of ninety-eight faceless cogs in a machine . Pilbeam merely felt isolated from his companions , felt nothing in commonwith the thousands of uniformed figures waiting rank upon rank on the shore . He was only Pilbeam , a man alone , a man with anger in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the disembarking commander-in-chief . Sir Robert Napier , trailing a dozen aides-de-camp , walked to the ship 's rail . Ile had a distracted air about him , as if he were not quite sure where he was ; he dismissed Captain Fellowes , straining to he noticed , with a single glance . Standing a little apart from the other aides were two officers . Pilbeam had seen them often enough , in Aden and on the Oclat'ia . Captain Speedy , the general 's Amharic interpreter , was close to I'ilbeanm 's size :  |p258six  feet three , two hundred fifty pounds . He wore a bushy handlebar mustache sprinkled with gray , a scarlet tunic , shiny black riding boots , and a floppy white turban . His cavalry saber 's sheath was embossed in silver leaf , but the hilt was wrapped in dirty cord and stained reddishbrownaround the hand-guard , proof that it had felt its share of blood and bone . Major Briggs was only a couple of inches shorter than Speedy , but so slender that he looked like a young boy beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Dunn , and now imitated Speedy in nearly everything . He had let his pointy mustache go wild , he wore a muslin turban and a scarlet tunic , he walked with a roll to suggest that he was more comfortable on horseback than on foot . He wore a cavalry saber like Speedy 's , too , but there was something about it or about Briggs himself that made Pilbeam sure he had smeared dirt on the hilt to make it resemble his new master 's . Speedy and Briggs were the leaders of an elite troop of cavalry . They and their twenty men , all officers , had spent their time in Aden dashing across the countryside , waving their swords and shooting their pistols and ruining their fine Arabian stallions . On the ship they had paced the deck impatiently for three days and talked loudly about all the glory they would win in Africa . The trumpets and bagpipes on the shore were suddenly silent , though one stubborn elephant kept up its bellowing . A band on the pier struck up " Hail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present arms . Captain Fellowes , at the head of the gangplank , stabbed his hat brim with the slice of his salute , and froze into position . But Napier only leaned against the rail and stared toward the escarpment . The band reached the end of the piece . The aides-de-camp exchanged bewildered glances , but none of them did anything . The conductor looked around for a clue as to what to do , then waved his baton . The band launched into " Hail the Conquering Hero Comes " for a second time . Speedy elbowed his way through the aides to Napier and said , " Sir Robert , perhaps we should go ashore . " Napier started . " Ashore ? Ah , yes , we should go ashore , should n't we ? " " The army is waiting . " " Well , away then . " Sir Robert returned Captain . Fellowes 's salute and started down toward the stone pier . The naval brigade paused in Zula only long enough to regain its sea legs . After dinner , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ascent to Komayli , a trip of fourteen miles . Their equipmentand their rockets were making the journey on a mule train that was going to follow immediately after them , but nonetheless they were uncomfortable walking on dry land in heavy boots . The caravan track from Zula to the defile had become a smooth , clear road . A full t ropical moon , shining bright as a beacon , lit their path and glinted off thep259half-completed railroad that paralleled the road . They proceeded slowly in single file up toward Komayli . By the time first light began to tint the walls of the defile , all Pilbeam could recall of the night was that the trousers of the man in front of him were gray in the moonlight and black in the shadows , and that his tarred queue bounced on his backpack . The sun was well up before they reached Komayli , which turned out to be a cool , green bowl buried deep among pine-spotted cliffs . More miles of climbing loomed ahead before they could reach Suru , but they debouched willingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the surrounding hills , ran a few hundred yards through the bowl , and then disappeared back into the ground . There had been signs of the work of the Indian Sappers all the way up the defile , and they had been here , too . Very neat catch basins of stone and mortar formed watering pools for the animals , and there were separate fountains for the men . The sailors drank and filled their canteens , staked out a place of their own , and prepared a late breakfast . The bowl was a temporary home for hundreds of other men , both soldiers and civilians . An army on the march might have been commonplace to soldiers , but to the sailors it was something new and fascinating . While they ate , they stared at all the curious meld and unfamiliar uniforms . There were at least twenty different uniforms . The 33rd , the Wellington 's Own , was made up of seven hundred Irishmen in scarlet tunics and black trousers . The 4th King 's Own , four hundred fifty strong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were representatives of several native Indian regiments , their skin colors ranging from the rich bronze of the Sikhs to nearly jet black , their uniforms a mismatchedcombination of European and Indian : scarlet jackets , white loincloths , turbans of white or claret brown , forage caps wrapped in puggrees of green or blue . A contingent of the Sind Horse ignored the trail and went crashing through the trees at the edge of the bowl . Their horses were ugly , raw-boned creatures , and their uniforms were just as ungainly : long green frock coats , green trousers , red sashes around the waist , red turbans , black leather sabretaches clanking along beside their sabers . By the time they had eaten , the sleepy sailors were ready for their tents and bedrolls , but there was no sign of the mule train . Not particularlysurprised , since no sailor would ever depend on a mule , they lay in the soft grass under the trees . With their greatcoats for pillows , they fell asleep . The mule train still had not arrived at sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courier that it had been spotted milling around in confusion at the bottom of the defile six hours before . The sailors cooked another meal from the supplies in their packs , and then scattered in different directions to find entertainment . Most ofp260them ended up joining a group of English soldiers chasing baboons through the hills . Pilbeam wandered thoughtfully across the bowl to the source of a queer , reedy music , which had been playing all day , in and out of his dreams . It was coming from a crowd of Madras Sappers , Irishmen of the 33rd , and Punjab Pioneers . The musicians were a quartet of Punjabis . They were concentrating so hard on their music , almost as if it were a religious ritual that could not be stopped for fear of breaking a spell , that they seemed to be utterly unaware of the crowd that surrounded them . An Ethiopian minstrel , an ancient , frail man in the white garments of the highlanders , wandered by the group and climbed a few yards up the hill . He sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began chanting in an odd , singsong voice . Pilbeam and a few of the Irishmen walked up toward him to listen . His words were perfectlyunintelligible , of course , except that they were able to pick out references to " Theodore " and " Magdala . " " Your man-o there would be singing in our honor , I suppose , " said the Irishman next to Pilbeam . " In honor of the damned English army . " " D'ye suppose ? " asked Pilbeam . " I suppose , young fellow , for whatever it 's worth , " said the Irishman . He spoke with the singsong accent of County Cork . Young was yoong , fellow was one syllable : yoong flah . He was a small man of about forty-five , puffing on a curved-stemmed pipe . Shaving discipline had been relaxed in Zula , and all the European troops had sprouted beards . This Irishman 's was black , just past the stage of bristles . He had shaved his head , too , and his forehead and scalp were tanned and seamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " said Pilbeam . " Do you feel honored ? " The Irishman fiddled calmly with his pipe . " Do you ? " Pilbeam grunted . The song the Ethiopian was playing seemed to go on forever without a break . After a while , all the other Irishmen drifted away to a lowbranchedbaobab tree . The embers of their pipes glowed out of the darkness . Pilbeam 's Irishman found a cigarette in a pocket . Pilbeam nodded his thanks and leaned over to light it from the Irishman 's pipe . They smoked and listened to the song , which by now was ten minutes old . Hoofbeats clattered through the Komayli bowl . Captain Speedy trottedout of the twilight . Major Briggs and several more of their band of adventurers were close behind . They stopped within a few yards of Pilbeam , as if they were looking through the gathering night for their path . Briggs saw the sailor and t he Irish soldier , and demanded , " Where is the water for the horses ? We were promised water here . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Water and fodder are that way , " answered the Irishman in a controlled , neutral voice . " The Parsees are seeing to it . They 'll set you on the path to Suru . " Without a word , Briggs turned his horse , but Speedy caught Briggs 's bridle . To Pilbeam and the Irishman he said , " Do you gentlemen have any idea what you are listening to ? " He did n't wait for an answer , did n't care whether they had one . He continued to Briggs : " He is singing about the certain destruction of the British army against the walls of Magdala , and our defeat at the hands of the invincible Emperor Theodore . He 's singing the praises of the emperor 's Twelve Disciples , and he 's telling how they will mow our troops down like wheat . " He said a few quiet words in Amharic to the Ethiopian , who snatched up his guitar and ran into the hills on his spindly legs . The cavalrymen cantered away . " Feel the perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not a bit of it , " said Pilbeam , puffing comfortably at his cigarette . " A smoke and a soft bit of grass to lie down on and no bosun 's mate hanging over your shoulder make all the difference . I do n't give a damn . " " I hear you , " said the Irishman . " My name is Irion . Geoffrey Irion , f rom Bantry , Ireland . Long ago , from Bantry . " Pilbeam enveloped Irion 's small hand in his own enormous one and introduced himself : " Arthur Pilbeam , from Folkestone , England . Long ago from Folkestone , as you say . " Night was falling . The Punjabis had started their queer Indian music again , and a troop of the naval brigade had started to dance the hornpipeon the grass , struggling to adjust their steps to the music . " You do n't join your friends , " observed Irion . He was lying back , propped up on his elbows . " I 'm not much for dancing , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You tars are all volunteers for this expedition , are n't you ? " " Aye . " " Why did you volunteer ? " " ' I'he monsoon was ending when I volunteered , " said Pilbeam . " It 's awfully hot on an ironclad steamer in the Indian Ocean outside monsoon . It 's cool here . Green . I have n't often seen so many pines , nor so many people . What about you ? " " I ? I go where the regiment goes . One place is the same as another , provided there 's plenty of food . " Irion waggled his pipe at Pilbeam. " lint I 'm curious about you . You are n't a jolly jack-tar like the others . I'nu 're too thoughtful . You are n't the type to volunteer . " Pilbeam stabbed out the butt of his cigarette with a wetted fingertip and dropped it in his pocket . A little defensively , he said , " You 're Irish . " It was more a question than a statement . " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "
