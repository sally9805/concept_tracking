hree-hundred-thousand dol lars a week is given away on TV game shows . Three-hundred  --  thousand bucks ! . . . and you could have a chunk of it . Or could you ? Well , you might , but it wo n't be easy . To be a TV game-show con  --  testant takes the ego of Howard Cosell , the exuberance of Robin Williams , the exhibitionism of Dol  --  ly Parton , the competitiveness of Muhammad Ali and the stamina of Seattle Slew . " It takes a type , " says Mark Goodson , TV 's godfather of game shows . " We want hype ; and we want enthusiasm , personality and a little reasoning ability . And you ca n't fake it . It has to be there . " Mark Goodson should know . Along with partner Bill Todman , Goodson produces the most suc  --  cessful syndicated TV program of our time ? " Family Feud . " But then , Goodson-Todman Produc  --  tions has been devising game-show winners since 1950 , when " What 's My Line ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed in color : " I 've Got a Se  --  cret , " " To Tell the Truth , " " The Price Is Right , " " Match Game " and the new " Password Plus .

Actually , Midwesterners make great con  --  testants . Southerners , too . But Easterners get tougher , and New Englanders are very rough because they hold back . We want real peo  --  ple , ones that the audience wants to watch , ones with real emotion . " To get these " real people , " Good-son 's staff interviews 300 families every week for " Family Feud . " And only eight families out of those 300 are selected to be on the show . Only eight ! Not very good odds , but then , that 's the normal selection percentage for a show of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  still thinking about a bite of that $300,000 ?

Then come with me into the inner sanctum of game shows and see how it really is . You see , I know . I was a game-show contestant  --  twice . Outside , the sun burned through the yellow haze and onto Holly  --  wood 's metropolitan grill . Inside , the sign on the door said " Heater-Quigley Productions . " I took a deep breath and walked in . The fuzzy-haired secretary be  --  hind the desk said , " Hi . Here for ' High Rollers ' ? " I grinned inanely , and she passed me an application form and pulled out a Polaroid camera . " Smile and say ' greed , ' " she said . I put on my best homemade-jam face and the flash went off . " Take this test , " she said , pass  --  ing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamlet ? " and " What football team does Terry Bradshaw play for ? " ( Shakespeare and the Steelers , respectively . ) I must have passed , because she taped a three-by-five card with my name scrawled across the top to my chest and ushered me into a cramped production office . There Continued on following page were another 50 people crammed into the tiny room , each with three  --  by-five name tags , each clutching Polaroid photos . I sat down . " Goofy test , " a cute contestant in a black velvet pantsuit , whose name tag read , " Patti Bryant , " said . " My ex-husband and I had to answer the same dumb questions to get on the old ' Gambit ' show . " " This your second quiz show ? " I asked , interested . ' No , third . Well , actually , I de  --  cided not to go on one called ' Hot Seat . ' Could n't afford to burn up my eligibility on a poor-paying show . " " Eligibility ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Cute , " Patti said . " Well , you see , network rules state that a contestant can only be on one game show a year and a maximum of three in a lifetime . So if you 're good at it , you only want to go for the big cash shows . " " Such as ? " I asked . " This one , ' High Rollers , ' is great ! Some guy won a bundle of cash and prizes , including two new cars . " " Maybe he should start a car lot , " I replied . " Cute , " Patti said . " ' Course , ' Match Game ' is a great show  --  all cash . So is Card Sharks . ' ' $20,000 Pyramid ' is also fabulous , but it 's taped in New York . All the others are made here in Los Angeles . " " How much can a contestant win ? " " Tons nowadays . They used to stop you at $20,000 . But this show lets you stay on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars won $57,000 ! Some Air Force captain won more than $100,000 on ' Joker 's Wild . ' That was really crazy . " " How much did you win on ' Gambit ' ? " " We only won a measly $3,300 ; $1,500 was in cash . That was three years ago . We had to sell a $500 stove to my mother for $200 . You have to pay taxes on all the stuff. - I leaned over to Patti and whis  --  pered , " What do you think our chances are of getting on the show ? " Patti glanced around the room , " See that cute little old lady in the flower-print dress ? " " Yeah , what chances does she have ? " " She 's a shoo-in ? , been on other shows . . . writes X-rated movie re  --  views for a men 's magazine . " " You 're kidding . " " Uh uh . You got ta have a gim  --  mick . Me ?

" First question ... are there four , six or eight pockets on a regulation pool table ' ? " Continued on page 99 " Thank you . " Now it was my turn to be the co  --  quette . I asked , " For what ? " " For the peanuts , of course . " Then I laid a line on her that I had been practicing for weeks and said , " Oh , my God , I must have sent the elephant the chocolates .

I had wandered around in the March night air of Philadelphia with little more than an open sports jacket and my fantasies to keep me warm . I was now paying the price . It would still be okay if the story ended here . It does n't . About a week or so after being thanked for the valentine , I took a date to see a Tennessee Williams play , Sum  --  mer and Smoke , starring Candice Bergen . There she was up on the stage . The male lead turned to her and said , in a tone that I did n't care for  --  I do n't remember the exact words , but I remember the gist ? " I bet you do n't go out very much .

" Good , good . Now , is a bivalve a plumber 's tool or a shellfish ? " " Plumber , plumber , " I bubbled . The coordinator looked down her long nose and said , " Wrong . " Next : " Was it Prince Charming , Prince Phillip or Prince Rupert who lived happily ... " " Prince Charming , " Patti buzzed in . I could see the production coordi  --  nator taking notes , grading us for en  --  thusiasm and ability . Then we were dismissed with the old Hollywood ax  --  iom , " Do n't call us  --  we 'll call you. - Nobody laughed . I was called the next day . " Be here tomorrow at 1:20 p.m. ? sharp !

" I 've never forgotten where I come from , " she says . " I 'm tremendously blessed . If somebody had told me 15 years ago that someday I 'd be on na  --  tionwide television , I 'd say , ' You 're crazy . I do n't have any talent ! ' But the Bible says that little is much when God 's in it . If I were to sum my life up , I 'd say He 's taken the little bit I had and multiplied it . I 'm so grateful . Every time I get into a bathtub with hot water and bubbles I say , ' Thank you , Jesus ! ' - More criticism . Thanking Jesus for a warm bubble bath may not be some people 's idea of reverence , but Tammy preaches a practical salvation and chats with Jesus as if He were her best friend . Which He is , she claims . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Hey God , this is n't fair . It 's not right . This is too hard . What are we going to do about it ? You 've got to help me ' cause I ca n't take it . ' I talk to God like that . He 's a friend . Our other friends might not have time to chat with us , be with us when we need them . But He 's always there , He pulls us through every situation . I 've seen God deliver us . " Deliverance came most recently when the Federal Communi  --  cations Commission in  --  vestigated PTL after a Charlotte newspaper charged that the minis  --  try had misused view  --  ers ' contributions . A detailed study of church records , books , contracts and tapes , plus interviews with PTL personnel , uncov  --  ered no wrongdoing . Although apparently unfounded , the allega  --  tions stung the Bak  --  kers , brought them closer together and left them a little wiser and tougher for the experi  --  ence . " I 've grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all that PTL has been through , I 've gotten a bit more serious about life . " Still , she realizes the danger of building up resentment toward per  --  sons who challenge the ministry , and she guards against becoming too strong or too hard . " It 's important to remain tender . Resentment only hurts you . Women do n't stay pretty if they do n't stay soft . I say cry it out , but always stay tender . " Most of her current activities revolve around her family  --  she no longer ac  --  cepts solo commitments out of town  --  and all projects include Jim . The cou  --  ple discovered long ago that separate interests only drive a wedge in their relationship . " We used to be more alike than we are now , " she says almost wistfully . " Jim 's more laid-back and quiet than I am . Sometimes I wish he 'd talk more .. . sometimes I wish he were more nutty . But I guess if there were two nuts in the family , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like he is . He calms me and keeps me in perspective . We complement each other . " 14 TV Games continued from page 99 I had expected a producer out of pure Hollywood , someone in a leather lei  --  sure suit with the shirt open to the navel and gold necklaces . What I got was a friendly father image in a tweed sports jacket . " Be bubbly , " I had quickly been briefed by a production coordinator , so I bubbled and babbled semi-silly answers to the producer 's " tell-me-about-yourself " questions . He seemed happy with the answers . I got a call the next day . " Report to the studio Saturday at 1:00 p.m . Plan on staying until 10:00 p.m . We will tape six shows with a live audience . Bring three coat-and-tie changes in case you win and appear on more than one show . Oh  --  do n't forget to smile ! " Click ! I made it ! One of the chosen few ! Saturday , 2:00 p.m . Black electrical cables twisted across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air conditioner swirled through the immense studio where the show was being taped . I shivered and leaned against the make-up booth door . Then Betty White walked up and peeked at me with that aging elfin look of hers and perked , ' ' Hi ! Gee , I hate to bust in , but do you mind ? " I was blocking the door to the make-up booth . I grinned ridiculously and stumbled aside . " Contestant ? " Bet  --  ty asked , as she slipped inside the tiny , mirrored room and plopped into a high wooden chair . " Uh  --  yes , " I said , poking my head through the doorway . " ' High Rollers . ' " That seemed obvious . A big orange tag stuck to my suit lapel pro  --  claimed in block let  --  ters : " Cork Millner , High Rollers . " " I do guest spots for ' Match Game ' , " Betty said , as a make-up girl tied a pink plastic bib around the celebrity 's neck . " Really ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Okay , Cork , lots of luck . " " Thanks , I 'll need it , " I said ner  --  vously . Butterflies were holding a bac  --  chanalia in my stomach . Brett Sommers , the perennial " Match Game " celebrity , stepped into the make-up booth . She checked my name tag on the way by and said , " Hi , Cork . " Folks are friendly at game shows . Brett , her hair in a halo of pink curlers , no make-up and her shape draped inside a shabby purple terry-cloth robe , looked more like a Hol  --  lywood caricature of a Monday-morn  --  ing housewife than a guest celebrity . I hovered near enough to hear Brett brief Betty on all the one-word cutesy little cliches that are common to " Match Game " : " Tinkle , boobs and bottom . " Alex Trebek , the host of " High Rollers , " suddenly stopped by the make-up room . I shrank hack . ( Studio rule number one for contestants : " You will be disqualified if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ) 1 slipped into the make-up booth next door , feeling a lit  --  tle like a fugitive . A mute old man ( rule number two : " Do n't talk to the make  --  up man . " ) checked my orange tag , then applied a coat of pancake to my face . I looked at my flat reflection in the mir  --  ror and grinned back at myself . " Bub  --  ble , " I thought , " be bubbly . " Just then Patti poked her head in the doorway . " Hey , Cork ! You made it ! " " You , too ? " " Sure , me and that little old X-rated reviewer , " she laughed . " You have marvelous eyes . " " Gets me on game shows . " A production assistant grabbed us both and , along with 14 other exciting , vivacious , energetic , outgoing , " smiley " contestants , herded us into the studio sound stage . And there it was  --  the big dice table , the prize board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " God , what am I doing here ? " I said . " I 've always been afraid of getting up in front of groups . " " Yeah , just think , " Patti answered . " Now millions of people will be watch  --  ing you . " " Thanks a lot , " I said , as the but  --  terflies began to kick up their orgy . We each got to take a practice turn at playing the game without the lights or game-show host , then we were taken to an isolation room behind stage . It looked a lot like Grant 's Tomb . Each contestant was given a stack of forms to fill out and releases to sign . " I think I just donated my first-born female child to NBC , " Patti quipped . The producer showed up in a new Continued on page 120 TV Games continued from page 117 sports jacket for a pep talk . " Okay , let 's be loose , glib and smart . And smile  --  even if you lose . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , identify with . Let 's see a little en  --  thusiasm . I want you to get up and scream ! " Silence . All I wanted to do was re  --  member my name , get a few answers right for my own personal pride and say , " Look , Mom , I 'm on television . Tell all your friends . " We waited : game-show gladiators waiting to be led to the lions . Then it was time . We were taken into the studio past the howling audience and seated , as one by one we were called into the quiz-show arena . Our co-contestants slaughtered one another . The previous week 's champi  --  on was destroyed by a skinny , out-of  --  style , miniskirted schoolteacher who went on to humiliate the next two players . " A computer , " Patti said of the win  --  ning schoolteacher . " A sausage grinder , " Mrs. X-rated added . The schoolteacher won $11,000 be  --  fore succumbing to an amicable semi  --  professional quiz-show contestant ( he had won a new car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I was called . I went : a con  --  demned prisoner being taken to the gas chamber . I huddled just offstage with a lovely , tall model in a scarlet dress . She clipped a tiny mike to my coat and grabbed my sweaty palm . She looked at a card in her hand . " Cork Millner , freelance writer . .. right ? " " Successful freelance writer , " 1 bub  --  bled . From somewhere a voice intoned , " And our next contestant .. . " and the model was dragging me across the car  --  pet and into the lights . " This is a successful writer , " the model said , and I grinned wildly . And Alex Trebek , the game-show host , said , " Okay , Cork , tell us a little about yourself . " In a blue , foggy haze , words came out of my mouth , and then we were playing the game . Amazingly , I got the first answer correct , something about Lady Godiva . Then I missed one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game . My tiny , innocent-looking , col  --  lege-coed opponent , sensing the kill , pressed on harder . My smile became creased , the people around me a swirl. .. then the final question ... win or lose , on this one : " What was the detective Colombo 's first name ? " . . . what ? I never watched " Colombo " ! The coed buzzed in ... ( Does n't she ever study ? Stays up all night watching TV detective shows ! ) She answered  --  correctly ! The audience screamed . I was crushed . Then I heard the voice of Alex . " Sorry that you did n't win anything , but we have some nice con  --  solation prizes . " So say hello to your consolation prizes and feel like a piece of crud . It was over . Here I was , one out of a hun  --  dred selected for the program , and it was over . I lost . I had forgotten one thing  --  only one out of 200 win . But it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exciting and rewarding ; and friends still come up to me in the super  --  market and say , " Hey , I saw you on television . " And Patti ? She won a bundle  --  more than $28,000 in cash and prizes . We celebrated her victory afterward with a candlelit dinner . She paid the tab . Well , that 's it , friends . That 's what it 's like in the inner sanctum of game shows . Still want to get off the old sofa and compete for fantastic prizes and a fleeting glimpse of fame ? If you really want to go from an at-home spectator to an on-TV contes  --  tant , here are some suggestions on how you can beat the 100 to 1 odds , pass the tests and beat the producers ' inter  --  views . * Know how to play the game . I met one vivacious blond homecoming-queen type who had never taken time to watch the quiz show on television . She bombed out on the test games . That was that . She never had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ producer is looking for . He wants one of either two types : a bubbly , outgoing and positive " jumper , " who will bound up and down and bounce around in front of the cam  --  era , or the quiet , vulnerable type with whom the audience can empathize when she 's desperately trying to an  --  swer a question or guess the price of a refrigerator . * Be someone interesting . Let 's face it , a housewife with two kids should have something else going for her to get on . Now , if she 's eight months pregnant or has 12 children or , better yet , has just lost 150 pounds in the last six months or , even better , was the first woman to play pro football for the Los Angeles Rams , then she 's a producer 's dream . Can you win ? Sure . Remember , ei  --  ther you or the other person is going to win . If you pass the tests , that means the producer figures you can win . He wants a close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You have a 50-50 chance to beat the other contestant , and he is just as ner  --  vous and worried as you are . And if you get by him , you have another 50 percent chance of winning the big money . Everybody  --  audience , pro  --  ducer , director and announcer  --  wants you to win . Just remember , even though the se  --  lection process is rough , the producer wants you ! He is in a ratings war with other programs and quiz shows . He knows that the better , livelier , bubblier ( that word again ) , best-smiling con  --  testant keeps him in the money . That could be you ! Let 's see now , if my wife can get on " Match Game ' 80 , " I can try for " Hollywood Squares " in ' 81 , and of course , the kids will be old enough for " Family Feud " in ' 82 . Then . . .
