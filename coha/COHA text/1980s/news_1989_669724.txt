The strongest flavor in the White House plan lies in its emphasis on free-market flexibility in how the pollution cuts are achieved. // The President is proposing fairly aggressive goals for cleaning up the air - targets applauded by environmentalists - but introducing some novel means for reaching them that could cut the economic costs substantially. // The President ' s plan would cut sulfur-dioxide emissions in half by the year 2000 , bring most smog-choked cities into compliance with federal health standards by 1995 ( all but three by the year 2000 ) , and cut air-borne poisons by 75 to 90 percent. // // Dan Dudeck , an economist with the Environmental Defense Fund ( EDF ) , is ecstatic . ' ' This is a perfect example of environmental perestroika right here in the US , ' ' he says. // Broadly speaking , the atmosphere has changed surrounding the Clean Air Act . For eight years under President Reagan , the White House constantly battled to lighten the burden that environmental regulation put on industry . The Clean Air Act has been up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House were deadlocked over any action on smog , acid rain , and airborne toxic wastes. // Now , a Republican president has proposed a Clean Air Act pushing more stringent standards , in some cases , than a prominent plan sponsored by Democrats in Congress . The environment has become a much more competitive issue between the parties. // Frank Blake , who served as general counsel of the US Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) during the Reagan administration , sees two patterns in the Bush proposals : an environmental aggressiveness and a commitment to the marketplace. // The marketplace plays the strongest role , as has been expected , in the plan to deal with acid rain . The White House calls for coal-burning utility plants to reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions , the chief culprit in acid rain , by 10 million tons by the year 2000 . Utilities within a state or utility area , however , can trade pollution credits between them as long as the total emissions meet the standard. // This flexibility allows efficiency that Mr. Dudeck of EDF believes could cut the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs. // The cost is a major concern to industry . William Fay , director of a business alliance called the Clean Air Working Group , says that the current Clean Air Act costs US industry $35 billion a year . EPA Director William Reilly estimated this week that Bush ' s proposals , if they become law , would add $14 billion to $19 billion to that cost by the early years of the next century. // It will take at least a week for the program that Bush outlined Monday to be drafted into legislative language . The actual language will go much further in refining the character of the plan. // ' ' We haven ' t seen any of the fine print yet , ' ' says Sierra Club Washington representative Daniel Weiss . ' ' One thing we ' ve learned about the Clean Air Act - the details are everything. ' ' // Adds Mr. Fay , ' ' Little changes in words can mean literally hundreds of millions of dollars. ' ' // Once the language is drafted , the plan goes to Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - some more stringent , some less so. // The central battle over clean air is between the unalloyed good of having cleaner air and the economic cost of cleaning it up . Environmentalists point out that air pollution itself has costs . Many of them - such as gray skies - translate poorly into economic terms . But the American Lung Association has made a stab at putting the cost of hospitalization , crop damage , and lost productivity at $40 billion a year. // Rather than simply balancing environmental goals against economic goals , Bush took a different tack . The use of marketplace incentives in controlling pollution has been gaining acceptance now for several years . But Bush has given the notion a strong embrace . It allowed him , at least in a broad conceptual plan such as the one he introduced this week , to choose targets acceptable to environmentalists while giving business the flexibility to cut the cost. // ' ' It took a lot more creativity , ' ' Dudeck says , than just splitting the difference between warring interests. // That flexibility ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an official with Buckeye Power , an Ohio utility with coal-burning plants. // Yet people on all sides of the clean-air issue are uncomfortable with parts of this plan. // ' ' It ' s clear that President Bush shares our objectives , but his plan needs to be strengthened , ' ' Mr. Weiss says. // Weiss is wary of the use of market flexibility in cities with smog problems . The Bush plan will eventually require automakers to sell 1 million vehicles a year that run on methanol , a cleaner-burning fuel than gasoline . But if industries or local government can come up with a better way to cut smog - chiefly carbon dioxide - by the same amount , they can opt out of the mathanol requirement. // ' ' History has told us that the more flexibility you give industry , the less pollution control you get , ' ' Weiss says. // Industry , however , is not thrilled with the methanol requirement either . Mr. Fay of the Clean Air Working Group and the American Petroleum Institute immediately registered their dissatisfaction , preferring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis. // Mr. Blake suspects that few areas will opt out of the methanol requirement . The cheap and efficient ways to cut smog are already in place . Going after small businesses like dry cleaners , whose emissions also contribute to smog and now face minimal regulation , remains an alternative . But politically it would be very difficult. // ' ' I think it ' s unlikely that the states are going to find a better way ' ' than methanol , he says. // Fred Smith , president of the conservative Competitive Enterprise Insitute , is more scornful . The federal government has moved from requiring fuel-efficient cars that no one wants to buy , he says , to mandating a fuel that no one wants to use. // The White House envisions a scenario where a guaranteed market for methanol vehicles will ensure that service station networks develop to fuel them . It costs about the same to make a methanol-burning car as it does to make a gasoline-powered one . It costs about $300 more to make a car that can run on either. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although not to as stringent a model as California ' s. // For air toxins - thought to be hazardous to the health of people who live near chemical plants - the plan requires use of the best available technology for capturing those toxins , but does not establish targets for emissions or health risk - disappointing some environmentalists and generally pleasing the chemical industry. // //
