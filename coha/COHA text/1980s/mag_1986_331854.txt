The myths of the romanticized West die hard , a fact that was making a tough job even tougher last week for a 100-man posse in three states . The searchers were engaged in an all too familiar chore : hunting down Claude Dallas , 36 , a self-styled " mountain man " who cold-bloodedly killed two game wardens in January 1981 . After the slayings , Dallas eluded similar posses in the bleak , high desert country near the Oregon-Idaho-Nevada border for 16 months before he was wounded and caught in April 1982 . On Easter Sunday , Dallas cut his way through two fences at the Idaho State Correctional Institution near Boise and vanished once again in his former haunts . <P> Bloodhounds working from the scent of a baseball cap found near the prison traced Dallas as far as the Paradise Hill Bar near Winnemucca , Nev. , close to the mobile home where he had been captured four years ago . To some locals , Dallas embodied all the old gunslinger 's heroics . He had proved that he was a faster draw than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no business invading his mountain camp to find out whether he was poaching game , a God-given right in the wilderness . Never mind that Dallas had pumped shots into the heads of both victims as they lay wounded on the ground . He managed to persuade a jury that he was guilty only of manslaughter . <P> Sheriff Vaughn Killeen , leading the manhunt from a Boise command center , was unimpressed by Dallas ' folk-hero image , garnished by two books and likely to be embellished in a movie that had been planned before his escape . Scoffed the sheriff : " The only difference between Dallas and other escapees is that he rides a horse and the others drive a car . " <P> But at the Paradise Hill Bar , Bartender Larry Asey declared , " He 's got a damn lot of friends up here . " Some of those supporters apparently were calling the sheriff 's office with phony tips about seeing Dallas everywhere from Canada to Colorado . The calls fooled no one as the pursuers prepared for a long , dangerous hunt in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide and plenty of folks willing to harbor a fugitive , even if he is actually as mean and brutal as most of the Old West 's false heroes .
