The budget surgery would affect just about everybody <P> Even more impressive than the depth of Reagan 's proposed budget cuts is the breadth . The President is asking Congress to reduce future spending for no fewer than 83 programs that benefit workers , businessmen , farmers , students , artists , the elderly , the sick , the poor , passengers on airplanes , trains , subways , buses-just about everybody . He would lower federal support for museums , delay some space-exploration projects , reduce postal subsidies possibly enough to force cancellation of Saturday mail deliveries . He would give states and cities far more authority to decide how to use money sent from Washington for education and health purposes . Yacht owners would have to pay more to use waterways ; air travelers higher ticket prices to make up for reduced airport subsidies . Here is a sample of what the President proposes to cut , who will be affected and how : <P> College Student Loans . Aid to college students-notably the Guaranteed Student Loan Program-will be cut by $803 million next year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice that in the following year . The loans , subsidized at 9% , are now available regardless of need ; under Reagan 's plan , families must prove they genuinely need loans to meet college costs . In addition , interest payments may no longer be deferred . Funding for Pell grants , which are direct scholarships to needy students , will also be reduced.Says John Phillips , president of the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities : " The effect will be an overwhelming shift to cheaper , public-supported colleges . " State college administrators agree ; they fear that this influx will place a new strain on state and local taxpayers . In Reagan 's budget message , the Administration countered that benefits " have become excessive , " and " could be recklessly expanded over the next few years without reforms . " <P> Comprehensive Employment and Training Act . Reagan plans to abolish the act 's public service employment programs , which would cost more than $3.7 billion next year . They pay the salaries of 1,600 employees in city government and nonprofit agencies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,500 workers , while New York City will dismiss 11,500 . " Most of ours will end up going back on welfare , " complains Ronald Gault , New York 's employment commissioner . Yet of all Reagan 's budget cuts , the controversial CETA program may be among the least missed . Says Cleveland Mayor George Voinovich , whose city has 500 CETA workers : " CETA was supposed to help us train people to do jobs in the private sector . But for years jobs in the private sector have been shrinking . It would have been more helpful to have used that CETA money to modernize our older industries and create jobs . "
