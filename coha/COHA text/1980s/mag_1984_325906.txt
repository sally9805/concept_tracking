In conversations with TIME Correspondent Jack E. White aboard a chartered plane during a hectic week of electioneering , Jesse Jackson addressed some of the most pointed questions raised by his unorthodox campaign . His views : <P> On the sometimes sharp reaction to his candidacy . Whenever the prospect of change occurs , there is always the inflamed and exaggerated response by the keepers of the gate of the status quo . Many of them are still in shock at the success of this campaign . They know that the course of American politics is changing . They do n't know quite where we 'll go . So in their panic , they lash out and attack . Every time there is a breakthrough , the politics of paranoia takes over . <P> On the threat by Nation of Islam Leader Louis Farrakhan against Reporter Milton Coleman . I immediately recognized it as religious metaphor . But it was dangerous language because of the ability to misinterpret it . I think it was more out of naivet than meanness . <P> On Farrakhan 's contributions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping to resurrect many people who had politically died or dropped out . In New York , for example , a large segment of the black community had a philosophy against voting . When we marched in Harlem , there were huge numbers of people who had never voted before ; Farrakhan was a great factor in making that happen . <P> On his support among whites . You do n't get 13% of the vote in Connecticut , with a 6% black population , with just black votes . You do n't get 13% of the vote in Arizona , 3% black , with just black votes . This campaign has consistently attracted more nonblack votes than Hart has attracted nonwhite votes . <P> On his relationship with Jews . A lot of Jewish people relate to me on a cumulative score of our relationship across the years . There is still a substantial number of Jewish people who remember my standing with them in Skokie Illinois when the Nazis threatened to march . Some others remember that in the Middle East I called for a mutual-recognition policy . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But unless you can talk with the adversaries , you can not help the ally . <P> On being misunderstood by white listeners . The language of black culture grows out of our Christian faith . We gained strength from biblical heroes and heroines . . . People who do n't understand my language-I am speaking English-are culturally deprived . . . When I give the example of rocks lying around and ask people to pick up their slingshots and throw their rocks , I 'm not talking about hitting somebody . Blacks understand that I 'm telling them to register and vote . <P> On press coverage of his campaign . I think that my constituents see a rhythm of attacks and they reserve the right to their own opinion without being unduly influenced by the media 's opinion of a given situation . I think that many black people read the Washington Post and the National Leader and they believe the National Leader . They read TIME and Jet and they believe Jet . Blacks are developing more confidence in their own frames of reference .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
