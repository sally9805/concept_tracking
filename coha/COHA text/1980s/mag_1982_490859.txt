THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE received the following coin- munication about a peculiar weekend from a young woman in Manhattan : Saturday night , four friends came over for dinner . One of the friends and I go back at least fourteen years , to undergraduate days . He stood in the kitchen and talked to me while the others talked in the living room . He explained to me that there was no easy way to defrost my refrigerator . He told me that his wife had recently found out that she was pregnant , and he seemed a little dazed and very pleased . I sauteed snow peas and dumped shrimp into marinara sauce . He put more ice cubes in his drink . In the living room , two friends of mine who have recently returned from Africa told the story  --  which is apparently now funny to them but horrifies everyone who hears it  --  about the night a Blanding 's tree snake got into their but and they decided to sleep until morning : Why search for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The wife of my friend from college modestly answered a few questions about her recent art exhibition in SoHo . When we sat down to eat , everyone began telling jokes . I remembered one joke to tell , and was proud of myself . After dinner , we drank champagne and ate candy . When the candles had burned to stubs , my friends left . ( One umbrella and one gray hat remained . ) I did the dishes and turned on my answering machine , to hear two messages that were n't important and one message , from my friend Lynn , that was : If I had a sedative " or anything like that , " please bring it in the morning for Sam . Lynn and I were freeing Sam the dog from the kennel he 'd been left in when his owner moved to L.A. , and we were going to Kennedy to send Sam hack to his owner . I checked the bottle of pills I carry , and Found , among the allergy pills , sleeping pills , and a couple of white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three whole ones . Sunday morning , Lynn rang my doorbell at nine-forty-five , and , along with Sam , we drove downtown to pick up Marty , a friend of ours who was flying to L.A. ? possibly to he on the " Tonight Show . " It seems that if a dog accompanies a passenger the dog can fly much cheaper . It would have cost hundreds of dollars if the dog had had to be sent alone . We waited outside Marty 's apartment house . It gave us time to look at the Operator 's Manual : it was a new car , and Lynn was n't sure how to turn on the heater . After the heater was blaring , Marty came out of his building a couple of minutes late , opened the hatch , and put in his suitcases . ( Sam had started out in the hatch but had made it to the back seat by the time I was picked up , and was now nosing his way into the front seat . ) We greeted each other I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time that the dog looked rather baleful . I whispered reassurances . At Kennedy , Lynn waited while I got the dog out of the back seat ( large Labrador  --  not easy ) and Marty got his suitcases As he and I went through the automatic doors , which slid open as we approached , I noticed that the dog continued to look baleful but now also looked a little surprised . Many people inside . Marty already had his ticket , but what were we supposed to do to get a cage ? Marty went up to one of the American Airlines personnel , who told us to get in line . We did , wondering if we were in the right line . The dog sat when I suggested it . Line moved quickly . A nice ticket agent , who acted as though Sam were the millionth large black dog she had seen that morning , made arrangements for a cage . Marty said , " There is n't a movie , is there ? " " Of course there is , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then can I change to an aisle seat ? " " You certainly can , " she said While she pushed endless buttons on the computer . I reached in my purse , opened the bottle of pills , and tried something I 'd never tried on the three previous occasions on which Sam and I had met : I opened his mouth and pushed a pill down his throat . He swallowed and averted his eyes . I whispered reassurances . A large cage appeared . The top had to be attached to the bottom , and Marty climbed over the metal baggage platform to help the ticket agent . The assemblage took quite a while , because it was a very large cage . The ticket agent tried a couple of possibilities , then attached the front door . Marty went to get water in a plastic dish that fitted in the cage  --  none of us ever figured out where or how , but it did n't really matter , because Sam lapped up half of the water right away . I removed Sam 's leash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tag and papers . Marty looked a little haleful himself , trying to figure out the best pocket in which to put a long metal dog leash . I urged Sam into the cage . I pushed only the teeniest , tiniest bit , when he was three-quarters in and stopped . After he was in , he turned around and looked at me . I pushed down the metal bar . " See ? " I said . " Everything 's fine . You can even turn around . " The ticket agent interrupted what might have become a melodramatic scene . " You 're going to have to help me lift , " she said . We grabbed the cage and hoisted it onto the conveyor belt , and I was astonished at how fast it moved away from me . I ran after it , startling another ticket agent , who was n't used to people running behind her ; the cage was on a little crooked , and it seemed important that it be right in the center . I got it facing perfectly forward , stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ticket agent and Marty , and went out to the car . The flight was going to leave in half an hour . On the way back to the city , I read the Operator 's Manual and figured out how to make the windshield wipers stay on . We took a wrong turn and detoured through some dreary side streets before we got back on the right track . We parked the car , and I went into Lynn 's apartment to have breakfast fixed for me . Before she started fixing it , she called L.A. ( covering the mouthpiece to whisper that Sam 's FEBRUARY 15 , 1982 owner was terrified when he heard who was calling ) , confirmed what flight Sam was on , said Sam had done marvellously  --  had n't he ? ( " Yes , " I said loudly . ) " Eighty dollars , " she said . Then she said , " I know , but that 's probably a cage for poodles or something . " Then she said , " I knew this last night , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described again the friend who was accompanying the dog , I realized that she had been a little more nervous about the whole adventure than I 'd known : she seemed almost skeptical when she said that Marty had been wearing a shirt and  --  with increasing vagueness  --  an overcoat , and ... a scarf ( " Yes , " I said loudly . ) A couple of hours later , back in my apartment , I called another friend . She seemed distracted . Finally , she blurted out , " Do you know if my brother 's back in New York or still out of town ? " I did n't know . She did n't want to disturb him if he was still out of town , she said , but the cat had run away . I tried to make her feel better : Cats did that , did n't they ? The cat was fourteen , she said , and it never ran away . I suggested that she try his apartment to see if he was home yet . She said she would . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think it 's right to keep things like this from people , " she said . Pluto Show THE 1982 Greater New York Automobile Show was held at the Coliseum last week , and we stopped by one afternoon for a look . Here are some of the things we saw : A man with a watering can watering a carpet . A radiant-looking woman in a golden gown standing on a revolving platform . Two young children holding balloons made of blue-and-silver Mylar and shaped like fish . A robot about ten feet tall , with a brass head , silvery biceps , and blue forearms , and with a lighted instrument panel set into its torso . Visitors , by pushing a button , could cause the robot to move its arms back and forth , turn its head from side to side , and  --  by means of a voice from a speaker  --  answer questions listed on a sign in front of it . The questions included things like " DO YOU HAVE A FAVORITE FANTASY : " and " CAN YOU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BE AMAZED . " A booth featuring something called a Telorex " 5000 " Personality Computer . Behind a counter was a bank of electronic devices about nine feet wide and seven feet high with flashing red , green , and amber lights . After a person paid a dollar and signed his or her name on a small sheet of cellophane , an attendant inserted the cellophane in one of the electronic devices . The device then issued a sheet of yellow paper printed with messages like " Your personal magnetism attracts many people to you " and " You have a very intense nature so must often he careful to curb your feelings . " A gleaming black partition , about eight feet wide and ten feet high , printed with large white letters that read " QUANTUM QUANTUM QUANTUM QUANTUM QUANTUM . " Two robots in the back seat of a car that was standing on fake cobblestones on a low platform . A sign identified the robots as Robert and Mathilde .

A reprint of an article from Motor Trend that read " You got ta he a car lover to appreciate this .... The tires will pick up the backbone of an ant . " Lots of metallic paint . A schedule of events that read , in part , " 11:30 A.m. ? Hypnotist Robert Halpern will give a discussion and demonstration on ' How to Cope with City Traffic and Highway Hypnosis .

A sign that read " THIS TRANS AM WAS ORDERED AY BURT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with blue-and-red lettering , a black hose with a blue-and-silver nozzle , and black-and-white gauges . In front of the pump was a small white button on a low stand . Above and below the button were signs that read " PUSH . " We pushed the button , and a voice from a speaker said , " Hi ! Bet I know what you 're thinking ! " Rubber Rodeo RUBBER RODEO , a from Providence described as a punk Western hand , recently gave a private performance for record-company representatives at Sundown , a club on East Fifty-sixth Street . We arrived a bit early appropriately , just as the sun was setting behind a huge butte of cloud  --  and , inside , found the dub lively with preparations . Most of the action was on the stage , which , besides holding instruments and amplifiers , was decorated with big , brightly painted cardboard cutouts : a cowboy , a cactus with a vulture sitting on it , an ear of corn , a rattler and a lightly clad cowgirl talking on the telephone . Amid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual electronic thuds and warblings . Across the room , another intent group was stationed around a large pot of chili on a hot plate . We talked to Don Rose , a cheerful-looking curly-headed young man , who was to be the master of ceremonies that evening , and learned that the chili had been put together not under a big sky somewhere but in the kitchens of Gourmet . " I have friends who work at the magazine , " he told us . " I found a butcher down near Chinatown , bought twenty pounds of beef , and told my friends to make a good , subtle , slow-burning chili  --  the kind that does n't ring its alarms till it hits the back of your throat . It 's urban chili . " Mr. Rose , who lives in Salem , Massachusetts , and occasionally spells his name " Rote , " is the owner of Eat Records , an avant-garde label that had just finished recording Rubber Rodeo 's first album ; he hopes to sell the album to a major company . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , single-button tweed jacket , he looked more like Ned Nickerson , Nancy Drew 's boyfriend , than like Roy Rogers . When we asked him for insights into Rubber Rodeo , he waited to answer until he had handed us a promotional booklet and we had taken in the cover , which showed a mesa with a cowboy on horseback talking to a young man and woman sitting in a sleek convertible . " That 's it , " Mr. Rose said . " Home on the range with modern technology . The main thing to understand about Rubber Rodeo is that they are more than a group  --  they 're an exercise in commercial art . They all used to be students at the Rhode Island School of Design , and now they 're packaging and marketing a product that 's a calculated reflection of American pop culture . They 've taken the newest rock and roll and combined it with the elements of cowboy tradition reflected in the television and comic books of the fifties and sixties . Their roots are in Gene Autry and Devo . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of audience do they appeal to ? " we asked . " A smart audience , " said Mr. Rose . " The scene they come from in Providence is the same one that spawned the Talking Heads and , a little earlier , Martin Mull . Their act is based on very subtle satire , and understanding the reference points requires some sophistication . Luckily , you can dance to their music whether or not you get the jokes . Most of the hand members come from solid , meat-and-potatoes Midwestern families , and their parents do n't know what they 're doing . For example , the lead singer Bob Holmes and his brother Barclay , the percussionist , are sons of a justice of the Ohio Supreme Court . The men in the family have been judges all the way back to Oliver Wendell Holmes , so Bob and Barc 's father is genuinely puzzled when he sees his sons playing cowboys up on the stage . " When the show began , we found out that besides the Holmes brothers the members of Rubber Rodeo are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doug Allen ( bass guitar , string bass , vocals ) , Gary Leib ( synthesizers ) , and Mark Tomeo ( pedal steel guitar ) . The men wore black jackets and Western-style string how ties , and Miss Milliken wore a full-skirted rodeo dress with layers of stiffly starched petticoats , small white boots , and a platinum-blond , Dolly Parton-style wig . They started off by racing into the theme from " The Good , the Bad and the Ugly , " and then Bob Holmes greeted the audience , urging everyone to eat some chili , kick up some dust , and have a stinkin ' good time . " Hoo-oo ! " he yelled . " We 're going to play some music for you tonight ! " They played versions of " Wichita Lineman " and Dolly Par-ton 's " Jolene " and also some original songs , one of which is called " Slippin ' Away . " Their renditions of the country-and-Western numbers had eerie electronic flourishes that suggested whole fleets of UFOs in communication ; and their delivery  --  with the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  had a touch of New Wave nihilism that made their occasional whoops seem downright perverse . The audience clapped hard and shouted after each number . We saw no cowboy hats in this crowd , or flouncy skirts , or pointy amphetamine-colored boots  --  no evidence of Prairie Modern . The style was generally Manhattan Muddle , with a bit of Lazy Punk . While Rubber Rodeo was still playing , Don Rose came and sat beside us and whispered , " Spaghetti Western . That 's another great way to describe them . They 've been deeply influenced by Ennio Morricone , the guy who wrote the scores for all those cheesy Italian movies . They love being fakes . " After the performance , we talked to Bob Holmes , a tall young man , whom the promotional material describes as " a Cowboy Mick Jagger . " He has full lips , slicked-back hair , and a way of speaking for which the words " modest " and " engaging " seem to have been invented . He told us that Rubber Rodeo had been started just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West had begun long before that . " I grew up in an Ohio suburb that was pretty far from the range , " he said . " In fact , John Glenn was our next-door neighbor . But , like all American kids , I dreamed of cowboys , and I just never got away from it . I still have a huge collection of cowboy comics and cowboy toys . Those kitschy things keep dreams of the ' West alive in the space age , and that 's what we try to do in our music . We 're different from urban-cowboy musicians . What they do is really traditional countryand-Western music with a rock flavoring . Our music is very new-style rock with country-and-Western themes . We 're slightly satirical , but we do n't mean to make fun of countryand-Western music . We only play songs we love . The idea for the band came into being one day when I was listening to a Hank Williams album and I got that high , lonesome pang that hits you sometimes on the inside of your chest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and roll , and , though it seemed impossible , I tried to put the two forms together . " He paused , and leaned back on the heels of his boots . " Of course , Rubber Rodeo has other roots as well , " he said . " We all tried out different musical forms . My brother Barclay , who is a great musician , used to play with a French band called Boring Music . The rest of us performed with the Asphalt Cowboys and , before that , with Blind Gary and the Foggy Vision Boys . " In the Way WHILE we were sitting by the telephone one night last week , Janet called again . The last time , she had a broken toe . " I 'm calling from my bed , " she said this time . " Recovering from what could have been a broken spine . " We gasped . " I was on my way to a gourmet " Frankly , it 's no better or worse than any other form of government.1 ) shop on Eighty-eighth Street to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained . " It was snowing . At Eighty-seventh Street and Columbus , I slipped on the ice in the middle of the street and crashed onto my spine and the back of my head . I remember thinking , Either I 'm dead or my spine is broken  --  this is it . Then the light must have changed , because I noticed a whole bunch of cars coming at me , and I thought , No , this is it . A woman rushed out screaming ' Stop ! ' and a car . . " Janet paused . " The car did n't exactly stop , " she continued . " It went skidding around me at the last minute . At that point , I decided I was not dead  --  I was in agony . I kept saying , ' I think I 'm in the way . ' I was having trouble breathing , but I thought I should continue . A lot of anxious faces were peering at me through the snow saying , ' Are you all right ? ' I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , so I said , ' Yes , but call my brother , who is a doctor in White Plains . ' I started to cry , but I explained to them that I was only crying because I was scared stiff . All of a sudden , a young man asked me to move my feet , and lie grabbed my head and turned it slowly from left to right . He turned out to be a doctor . Someone had called an ambulance , but a cop said we should n't wait for the ambulance , because they always come too late . Just then , the ambulance showed up , and the cop climbed in with me and asked for my right age . In the emergency room at Roosevelt Hospital , six different doctors came to see me in the six hours I was there . They were all twenty-eight years old , they all had beautiful teeth , and they all asked , ' Did you lose consciousness ? ' In every compartment , there was somebody else who had slipped on the ice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keep your finger elevated . Put it on a pillow . ' I heard a woman 's voice in the hall crying 0y , oy , oy ! ' Please take care of that Jewish lady out there , ' I said to the doctor . He said she was Spanish . I said that if she was Spanish she would be saying ' Ay , ay , ay . Janet took a breath . " After the X-rays , they told me I could go home , " she said . " I explained that I was in complete agony , so they gave me a pill for pain , a shot for pain , a wheelchair , and a cane , and told me to call a friecid , because the volunteer who wheels you to the door had left . By the way , my broken toe is completely healed . "
