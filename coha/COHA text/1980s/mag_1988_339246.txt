Thomas Stearns Eliot was born in St. Louis on Sept. 26 , 1888 . He died in London on Jan. 4 , 1965 . These dates and places bracket a life but are swamped by its reverberations . For Eliot , in transit , not only wrote The Waste Land , the single most influential poem in English of the 20th century . He also produced a body of work  --  poetry , criticism , plays  --  that permanently rearranged the cultural landscapes of his native and adopted lands . <P> Exactly how he created himself and his era remains something of a mystery , the topic of continuing debate . And this discussion is about to intensify nearly everywhere , thanks to the occasion provided by Eliot 's centenary . For openers , a long awaited addition to the Eliot canon will be published next week on his 100th birthday : The Letters of T.S . Eliot , 1898-1922 ( Harcourt Brace Jovanovich ; 736 pages ; $29.95 ) , the first of four volumes of Eliot 's correspondence , edited by his second wife Valerie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new issues of Eliot 's writing . The British Council has mounted an exhibition illustrating Eliot 's life and work that will eventually travel to 70 countries . The U.S. observances will include a memorial lecture at the Library of Congress and a gathering of Eliot scholars + and critics at Washington University in St. Louis . There will even be a conference in Japan . <P> And then there is Cats , Andrew Lloyd Webber 's extravagant musical adaptation of Eliot 's book of light verse , Old Possum 's Book of Practical Cats ( 1939 ) . The smash show has been seen by some 25 million people in 15 countries and contributed more than $2 million in royalties to the Eliot estate . Purists shudder at such commercial success and its spin-offs . Says Critic Hugh Kenner : " Eliot wanted to connect with a popular audience , but Cats was n't what he had in mind . " <P> But Cats and the hoopla still surrounding Eliot attest to the poet 's surprising vitality . By many standards he should have been old news by now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when the fashionable tides were running against all three . As a shy , uncertain young man , he was torn between the dictates of his proper upbringing and the tug of his emotions . He looked inward and saw himself coming apart ; he looked outward and saw Western civilization dissolving into chaos . He tried to heal these rifts with words : " I have measured out my life with coffee spoons . . . April is the cruellest month . . . I will show you fear in a handful of dust . . . This is the way the world ends/ Not with a bang but a whimper . . . And let my cry come unto Thee . . . In my end is my beginning . " <P> His poems struck many readers as acts of mind reading . There was no need for them to memorize Eliot ; he had , it seemed , already memorized them . He became famous by age 35 without growing satisfied with his accomplishments or happy with himself . Words were not enough . Behind the lectures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stooped figure in the three- piece suits , issuing pronouncements  --  was concealed a soul in torment , trying to purge itself of sin and of the world that lavished so much praise on what he considered his unworthiness before God .
