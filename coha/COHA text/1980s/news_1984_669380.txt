A Scudder mutual fund ad shouts : ' ' New York income triple tax-free . ' ' And the Bevill , Bresler &; Schulman firm points out that an 11. 25 percent yield on a New York City bond bought by a N.Y.C.resident in the 50 percent tax bracket ' ' is like getting a 22. 50 percent yield from a taxable investment. ' ' // Daddy Warbucks would understand . The bond market has been been battered . Creditworthiness of muni bonds has been low since the Washington Public Power Supply System bond default last year . Thus the interest they pay is high . Ergo : Buy low , get high yield , decent safety , and tax protection. // But you don ' t have to be a titan like Warbucks to need to shelter the interest earnings you can enjoy today . Two-income families can easily fall into a high enough tax bracket to want a safe , tax-sheltered investment . As the ads suggest , if you ' re living in a city like New York , these investment devices can exempt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends you receive. // There are three ways you can go : // // * Buy a municipal bond. // // * Buy into a closed-end unit investment trust that is holding a packet of muni bonds. // // * Buy shares in a mutual fund that buys and sells muni bonds. // Municipal bonds themselves are fairly sound investments . But they are expensive , a bit inconvenient in that you are always clipping coupons , and not particularly liquid - which is bad if interest rates go higher and your investment starts dropping in price. // You can go one better with the unit investment trusts ( UITs ) , such as those advertised by Empire State . Robert Check , senior vice-president of the Advest brokerage , says UITs his company sells appeal to an older investor with $150 , 000 to $200 , 000 to invest - ' ' serious money ' ' that would otherwise go into bonds or certificates of deposit . The UIT buys the bonds for the investor , clips the coupons , and distributes or reinvests the dividend. // Mr. Check says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and socked with state and local taxes , would need an investment with a 25 percent interest rate to be the equivalent of a 10 percent triple tax-exempt UIT . A UIT ' s trustee fee is minuscule ( usually 0. 15 percent a year ) , since there is no portfolio management involved . But there ' s a hefty 4- to 5-percent sales charge , making a UIT better for a long-term investor than a short-term one. // An investor seeking greater liquidity , diversity , and professional portfolio management may want to look for a mutual fund that invests in municipal bonds . With one of these , your shares are immediately redeemable . If your municipal bond fund is in a fairly diverse mutual fund family , often you can switch your money from one fund to another as you desire . And in a down bond market , the portfolio manager can channel the money into cash , shed certain bonds , or do both. // Muni bond funds are relatively easy to afford , usually beginning with investments as small as $1 , 000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is with individual muni bonds and muni investment trusts , for unlike the latter two , muni bond fund prices are quoted in mutual fund tables of many newspapers. // The federal tax savings you can achieve depends on your bracket . If you have income of , say , $25 , 000 and you are filing your taxes singly , a 10 percent yield on a tax exempt muni bond fund would be equivalent to a taxable yield of 14 percent . With joint income of $70 , 000 , a 10 percent muni bond fund yield would amount to a 17. 24 percent taxable yield . If it is a no-load muni bond fund , you realize virtually all of that gain. // Remember that only municipal bonds issued by your own state are totally tax-free to you . Similarly , a UIT or muni-bond fund must be set up for your state if you want the maximum tax benefit ( assuming , of course , that that is even a consideration : Some states do not have income tax and many cities do not ) . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UITs and muni-bond funds work : A batch of AA bonds , say , can be held with higher-yielding BBBs ( many of which carry private insurance to comfort investors in these riskier vehicles ) . When the UIT or mutual fund pots are stirred , you end up with a higher interest rate than a high-quality bond would pay - but with almost as much safety , and greater liquidity. // One problem is that when the bond market dives as it has the past few months , prices of bonds in the UIT also fall . That flattens the yield and erodes your capital like ' ' Chinese water torture , ' ' one analyst says. // The same problem affects municipal bond mutual funds . But J. Michael Pokorny , vice-president and portfolio manager of the Philadelphia-based Delaware Management Company ' s Pennsylvania Fund , points out that when the bond market slumps , many municipalities stop issuing bonds . Some are legislatively barred from doing so at high interest rates . That decreases the supply of bonds . Yet demand for these bonds remains fairly steady from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices stable. // ' ' Our fund really does well in up and down markets , ' ' Mr. Pokorny says . ' ' There ' s always demand for Pennsylvania paper . ' ' In 10 years the fund has grown to $57 million . Its yield at this writing was 8. 72 percent. // There are about 30 muni-bond mutual funds especially tailored to different states , notes Reg Green of the Investment Company Institute ( ICI ) . Most are designed for residents of New York , California , Massachusetts , or Pennsylvania . Assets of these funds amount to $4 billion , a modest part of the total assets of $116 billion reported by ICI members in April . But they are a relatively recent development , Mr. Green points out , and have grown rapidly. // Such growth is evident in no-load bond funds introduced last July by the Boston-based Scudder Funds for New York and California residents . In less than a year , the California fund assets jumped to $40 million and the New York fund to $30 million. // Richard F. Seamans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funds was particularly timely : ' ' It ' s an area where professional management hasn ' t been offered before to ( municipal bond ) holders . ' ' He considers it the most rapidly growing area of mutual funds , attracting moderate to high tax-bracket investors , who can enjoy ' ' not only a tax-exempt return on dividend income but capital appreciation as well.
