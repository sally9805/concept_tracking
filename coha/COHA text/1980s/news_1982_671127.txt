Causing delight in the suburban communities but some anxiety within Hartford , several of the major insurance companies are running out of expansion room in their downtown office towers and are turning to the suburbs to house large parts of their growing operations. // " When the companies reach the point where they must add some more square footage , they reorganize their operations , " said Joseph C. Mike , the State Insurance Commissioner . " For the most part , companies are not abandoning their Hartford operations but are choosing to expand elsewhere. " // " I see nothing wrong with anyone expanding to the suburbs to set up satellite operations as long as they ' re not moving out , " said Thirman L. Milner , Hartford ' s Mayor . " I think the fear a lot of people have - largely unfounded , I think - is that home offices are leaving . I don ' t see that happening . " <> <> Burst of Construction // What is happening , however , is a burst of construction activity on behalf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hartford Insurance Group broke ground in Simsbury , 12 miles west of its Hartford headquarters , for one of the largest insurance projects in Connecticut - a $100 million office park that will eventually house 1 , 750 employees working in a data processing center and the company ' s life , health and annuity operations. // Earlier this month , the Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company broke ground for an $8 million office building in Enfield , north of Hartford , to house about 500 workers in its group life and health insurance operations. // The Travelers Insurance Companies , whose 34-story office tower has been a beacon over downtown Hartford for 63 years , plans to begin construction next spring in Wallingford on a $75 million office complex for 2 , 500 employees in its group-insurance department . The site is not far from Middletown , where a giant steel skeleton is rising for what will be a $90 million building for 5 , 000 employees of the Aetna Life and Casualty Company. // Aetna is Hartford ' s largest corporate employer , with 11 , 700 workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 employees at its home offices here. // The Covenant Life Insurance Company , relatively small by Hartford standards with 230 employees , is shopping for a site to move its offices from the city ' s Woodland Avenue to the suburbs by the end of 1984 . " Suburban sites cost less than going downtown , " explained S. Robert Fawber , senior vice president. // Recession or not , the insurance industry has continued to grow in recent years , filling up office space in Hartford almost as fast as the companies have added it. // The Hartford Insurance Group , for example , will complete an expansion of 200 , 000 square feet at its Hartford headquarters by the end of next year in addition to embarking on the huge new office park in Simsbury . " We ' ve added as much space as we can in Hartford , " said Pamela Small , a company spokesman. // In addition to its project in Middletown , Aetna Life and Casualty is converting a row of old factory buildings in Hartford into offices . It has also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under construction and is building a training center on what had been a company parking lot near its sprawling home offices on Farmington Avenue . Aetna , whose employees are now scattered among a dozen temporary locations in Hartford , estimates that its home office work force will increase by more than 7 , 000 , or 60 percent , by 1990. // Insurance executives have stressed repeatedly that their moves to the suburbs do not signal any lessening of their companies ' commitments to Hartford , but some neighborhood groups , concerned about high unemployment and the shortage of housing in Hartford ' s inner city , are not so sure . <> <> Group Seeks Job Commitment // Kevin Kelly , director of the Asylum Hill Organizing Project , a neighborhood group , said he was concerned that the suburban expansion of insurance companies with white-collar jobs would leave Hartford with a blue-collar and largely unemployable work force . The group is seeking commitments for 2 , 000 entry-level jobs and a $20 million mortgage pool from the largest insurance companies . " From my perspective they are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Kelly said of the insurance companies. // Insurance has been a mainstay of Hartford ' s economy since the early 1800 ' s when this city on the Connecticut River was a bustling seaport . The Yankee traders who dealt in rum , molasses and spices and the manufacturers of hardware , tools and firearms began to band together informally with the ship captains to share the risks of the voyages of the clipper ships against fire , pirates and storms. // According to corporate lore , the first accident insurance transaction took place here on March 24 , 1864 , when James G. Batterson , a Hartford businessman who was starting a company to be known as the Travelers , encountered James E. Bolter , a local banker , at the post office . <> <> First Policy Was Verbal // Mr. Bolter said he was going home to lunch and asked how much it would cost to insure him against an accident between the post office and Buckingham Street .

The banker handed over two pennies and made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still treasured as a souvenir , according to the Travelers. // These days the 14 largest insurance companies with headquarters in the Hartford area have combined assets of more than $53 billion . According to a recent survey by the Insurance Association of Connecticut , the insurance industry directly employs 44 , 500 in the state , mostly in the Hartford area . Counting independent agents and brokers plus others across the state who work indirectly for insurance companies , the industry provides jobs for 155 , 000 people , or 10 percent of Connecticut ' s work force. // Mr. Mike , the State Insurance Commissioner , noted that while some companies were expanding outside Hartford , the state ' s job base was being maintained . " We would be distressed if companies relocated outside Connecticut , " he said. //
