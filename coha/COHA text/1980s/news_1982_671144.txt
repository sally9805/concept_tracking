No longer need young Chinese wonder whether an alien beat is luring them , toes tapping and fingers snapping , down the ruinous road to bourgeois perdition. // A new lavender-colored booklet , entitled " How to Distinguish Decadent Songs , " explains the perils of " quivering rhythm , " unruly notes and the " unclear , loose , drunken pronunciation " peculiar to imported popular music. // The booklet ' s publication last June is another broadside in the propaganda war that the authorities are waging to keep young Chinese from succumbing to Western temptations . The prime targets are foreign publications , films and music denounced as " huangse , " which literally means " yellow " but is freely translated as decadent , pornographic or obscene. // // 24 , 000 Publications Seized // Last spring the Chinese Government formally banned videotapes , records and cassettes with " decadent and indecent content " and promised to evaluate the artistic merit of future imports . The New China News Agency reported that " some bad items have circulated in recent years , corrupting people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be labeled blue in the West . Early this year the police in Guangdong Province raided some makeshift theaters that peasants set up to show raunchy videotapes smuggled in from Hong Kong . Video recorders must now be registered with the provincial authorities . Customs officials in Shenzhen , the special economic zone bordering Hong Kong , have reported seizing 24 , 000 pornographic publications since January. // The rest of the contraband , extending to rock music , merely suggests there are things more fun to do than build Communism . Last summer Canton ' s residents had to dismantle their fishtail antennae , which brought in television shows from Hong Kong. // The fear of Western bourgeois contamination is so widespread that the authorities in Tibet held a conference last May to decide how to stop the circulation of " obscene " material and cleanse local minds of " spritual pollution . " The conference asked party members to set an example by turning in their own bootleg tapes and books . <> <> Classical Music Wins Approval // Chinese musical fare has improved since the Cultural Revolution , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Medical Teams in Tanzania " and " The Nightsoil Collectors Are Descending the Mountain . " Classical music is once again permitted. // But the lid has descended on other Western music , after a few heady years in which some bookstores were selling cassettes of songs from Hong Kong and Taiwan along with pirated American hits. // A recent visit to a bookstore on downtown Wangfujing Street turned up only " Puff the Magic Dragon " and " Que Sera , Sera " on a tape cassette of English lessons . There were also some Japanese kabuki records and two cassettes of Yugoslav folksongs. // Domestic music included several revolutionary operas like " The Red Detachment of Women , " by now on sale , and approved pop songs by Su @Xiaoming , a soprano with an artistic troupe of the Chinese Navy. // Some Chinese youths , the sort who wear bell-bottom jeans and sunglasses with the foreign label attached , affect a taste for Western rock music , but most young people find it discordant . They much prefer the softer sounds of John Denver , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also partial to " Red River Valley , " " Jingle Bells " and " Do-Re-Me , " from " The Sound of Music . " <> <> ' Studying Is More Important ' // Even this strikes some elders as decadent . A Peking student related that when his younger brother asked him to borrow some tapes of Peter , Paul and Mary from his classmates , their father objected , saying , " Be careful of all this love , love , love . Studying is more important. " // The authorities feel threatened more by the sentimental ballads that find their way in from Taiwan and Hong Kong . Taiwan ' s singing star , Teresa Teng , who is known here as Deng Lijun , is banned , though her saccharine love songs hardly seem subversive. // Last spring students at Qinghua University were ordered to turn in their foreign music cassettes , though a student said that not everyone complied . At another Peking institute students were asked to register the titles of their tapes and records. // The musical crackdown has extended to closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Peace Hotel in Shanghai . Last summer the police raided some private disco parties held by the children of Government officials . This month a Shanghai baker named Lin Youjie got 15 days in jail and had his tape recorder confiscated for charging the equivalent of 25 cents admission to illicit dances in his home . <> <> ' Social Problem of Some Concern ' // But a raid on a dance at a high school here recently drew a protest from China ' s youth newspaper . Two policemen closed down the party celebrating China ' s national holiday on Oct. 1 and hauled off the schoolteacher for letting boys and girls dance together . He was released after writing two self-criticisms. // The youth newspaper complained that the police should not have interfered because the dancing helped the mental health of the pupils , enriched their extracurricular life and promoted a sense of collectiveness. // The recent guide to decadent songs takes a sterner view of frivolity , asserting that " Hong Kong and Taiwan popular music has made festering inroads on the taste , perception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular. " // The booklet called this " a social problem of some concern . " Most Hong Kong and Taiwan songs are " low and dirty , " it said , and , moreover , " they don ' t express working-class sentiments . " Such love songs gave no clear indication of a person ' s status or thinking , it added. // " What they sing about is deformed love in a colonial or semicolonial society , " it said . <> <> Definitions of Western Music // The editors also supplied these definitions of Western musical perversion : // - Jazz is syncopated music that " forces people to accept what is unexpected , the abnormal beat . " And " dancing to this kind of music is like having nervous spasms . " Furthermore , " the rhythm of jazz is against the normal psychological needs of man. " // - Rock-and-roll of the 1950 ' s replaced jazz with " a frenzied beat , neighing-like singing and a simple melody . " Rock songs of the 1960 ' s have even more percussion and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What they pour out is a kind of passion for the bewildering , the vague , the numb and the impetuous. " // - Disco music has a minimal melody and lyrics and a " rapid beat like a war drum . " The guide explained that " disco dancing is rapid and continuous leaping and twisting . " And " the dancer can choose whatever steps he likes . " Actually , " it is a way for the dancer to do whatever will express his feverish mood . " <> The guide concluded that popular music has no artistic value to speak of . " The reason is because it meets the needs of people ' s negative spiritual life in capitalist society , " it said , adding , " It also meets the needs of capitalists who make money.
