There has to be a place in Pro football for Doug Flutie . If there is n't , then something is wrong with the sport . In the New England Patriots ' last five games , all of which he started , plus a sixth in which he relieved quarterback Tom Ramsey and led the team to victory , the Pats have gone 4-2 . Before Flutie took over , they were 1-3. // People keep mentioning that he 's only 5 ' 9 ? " . But let 's not forget that Flutie is the alltime collegiate total-yardage leader , winner of the Heisman Trophy and a fantastic-finish specialist . The word " intangibles " might have been invented for him . // I remember talking to an NFL scout in early 1985 , after Flutie 's senior season at Boston College . The memory of the last-second bomb to Gerald Phelan that beat Miami was still fresh . " Name a quarterback under six feet who ever won a championship , " the guy said . " Super Bowl or , before that , NFL or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy over 6 ' 3 " who ever won one , " I said . // Well , he could n't , although he would have one now  --  6 ' 4 " Doug Williams , MVP of the last Super Bowl . It 's a fact . Going back to the first T formation quarterback on a title team , Sid Luckman of the Chicago Bears in 1940 , until last season , champion signal callers fell between 6 ' and 6 ' 3 " . // But that does n't mean little guys ca n't play . Eddie Le-Baron , who was only 5 ' 7 " , was a highly productive quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys in the early ' 60s . At 5 ' 10 " , Frankie Albert of the San Francisco 49ers was one of the great stars of the old All-America Football Conference and then of the NFL . He was a super scrambler with a wonderful grasp of the game  --  a " magician " who made things happen . Such phrases have been applied to Flutie so frequently that he 's sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.K. , so he was n't really a T quarterback  --  he was more of a single wing tailback , a run-and-pass guy  --  but he stood 5 ' 7 " . All O'Brien did for the Philadelphia Eagles as a rookie in 1939 was to set NFL single-game and season passing records . Then after two years he quit football and joined the FBI . // The point is , these guys could play , and so can Flutie . His whole mentality is geared to figuring out ways to beat you . Here 's the mind of Doug Flutie at work : " I 've got a bunch of plays I 'd like to try someday , plays you 've never seen but which could work . " // Plays ? What plays ? // " O.K. , " he says . " There are two seconds left , and you 're down by a point or two and you 're near midfield , out of field goal range . You 've got time for one play . Ninety-nine times out of a hundred , you 'll see one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance of success . What I 'd do is throw to a receiver around the 25 or 30 , in the middle of the field , and then have him drop-kick a field goal on the run . It 's legal . You can drop-kick the ball at any time . " // Yeah , but who can do it these days ? // " I can , " says Flutie . " Rich Camarillo , who used to punt for us , and I used to practice them . He could drop-kick it 60 yards . Find a guy who can do it and put him in as a wide receiver . " // Do you wonder why the guy became a legend in the Boston area ? Two-handed push passes , lefty tosses , completions that materialized out of nowhere  --  the fans could n't get enough of him . And that 's part of the problem . The hard-eyed world of pro football does not take kindly to schoolboy legends . // After BC , he joined the USFL New Jersey Generals and , on owner Donald Trump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league folded , he joined the Bears for the ' 86 season . Jim McMahon was injured for much of the year , and Flutie got to start the last game of the regular season . He led Chicago over Dallas but was ineffective in a first-round playoff loss to the Washington Redskins . McMahon was n't kind . " America 's midget , " he called Flutie. // The Patriots got him in a trade last season as the strike was winding down . He started the final strike game , which some people have never let him forget . " If the strike had just started , I would never have crossed the line  --  never , " he says . " But everyone knew it was ending . A lot of guys had already crossed . The paycheck was n't the issue . It was a chance to get back into football . " // If Tony Eason 's arm had been right , Flutie might not have made the Patriots this year . Steve Grogan would have been the backup , and Flutie would have battled Ramsey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on injured reserve in the preseason , and Grogan , who had been hampered by a neck injury , was replaced by Ramsey in Game 5 , against the Indianapolis Colts . Flutie came in for an ineffective Ramsey early in the fourth quarter . He engineered two drives to pull out the win , completing four of four passes on the first and six of six on the second . He scored the game-winner on a 13-yard bootleg. // When the Patriots defeated the Bengals , mainly on the strength of a solid running game and six Cincinnati turnovers , the headline in the Boston Herald read FLUTIE FLAUNTS IT FOR PATS . YOU had to go down to paragraph 22 to find the only mention of Flutie . The story line in New England 's 30-7 upset of Chicago was Flutie 's revenge : He threw four TD passes against his old team . Almost lost was the fact that the Patriots ran 54 times for 185 yards  --  unheard-of statistics against the Bears ' defense . // " It 's hard for people to accept that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my best to help us win , " said Flutie after Sunday 's 21-10 victory over the Miami Dolphins , in which he converted seven of 14 passes for 74 yards while the ground game piled up 203 yards . " Even in college I did n't get carried away with all that stuff . We had great players on that team my senior year . Something like 10 guys I played with on offense wound up in the NFL. " // Over the past four games the Pats have had only two turnovers . In the six before that they had 23 . Rookie halfback John Stephens , of Northwestern State of Louisiana , has been superb . Flutie has been going along with the surge , occasionally embarrassed by the media attention he receives , never claiming to be anything but a guy trying to prove that he belongs with the big boys . // But somewhere down the stretch , when things are n't going right , it will be time for something special , and maybe the old Flutie devilment will reappear . So far he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
