Is somebody trying to steal secrets from Tony the Tiger ? Apparently so , according to officials at Kellogg headquarters in Battle Creek , Mich . Since 1907 , millions of people have toured the Kellogg plant where Special K , Rice Krispies , Frosted Flakes and other popular cereals are produced . Unfortunately , the company says , at least two recent visitors have actually been industrial spies sneaking a peek at the company 's technology . Last week , in a move to foil further plots , Kellogg announced that it will no longer conduct public tours inside the factory . <P> Kellogg says that it is spending $500 million to modernize its main plant and that the counterespionage strategy was necessary to guard its technological secrets . The retooling is part of an effort to develop cereals for new market niches . In the past three months , Kellogg has introduced two products to appeal to health-conscious adults : Just Right and Raisin Squares . <P> Kellogg 's move has caused consternation among members of the local Chamber of Commerce . City boosters say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose its snap , crackle and pop . They may be right . The town 's best remaining attractions are a bird sanctuary and the Battle Creek zoo .
