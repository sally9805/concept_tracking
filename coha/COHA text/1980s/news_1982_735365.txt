txt Diamonds are forever . They have forever been the symbol of betrothal and romance . Or at least they have been since 1939 . That 's when De Beers Consolidated Mines Ltd. , the South African cartel that controls diamond production and mining , and the American advertising firm N.W. Ayer transformed diamonds from gems with declining sales into a central , indeed essential , element of courtship . Through Hollywood films , gossip columns , high school lectures , planted articles and eventually up The Bookshelf " The Rise and Fall of Diamonds " By Edward Jay Epstein to $10 million a year in advertisements , De Beers ' sales of diamonds in the U.S. rose from $23 million in 1939 to $2.1 billion at the wholesale level in 1979 . A similar campaign changed the 1,500-year-old . Japanese tradition of courtship : In 1968 fewer than 5% of Japanese brides received diamonds . but by 1981 60% were so honored . This is but one facet of Edward Jay Epstein 's thoroughly engrossing book , " The Rise and Fall of Diamonds " ( Simon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Epstein , who has earlier debunked the myth of 28 Black Panthers supposedly knocked off by the police in 1968-69 , described the pre-Dallas whereabouts and doings of Lee Harvey Oswald and analyzed the slovenly habits of media news coverage , may yet turn investigative reporting into a respectable profession . Here he unveils the structure of the diamond business , and , as suggested by his subtitle . " The Shattering of a Brilliant Illusion , " he argues that the multi-billion-dollar diamond dynasty may soon come tumbling down . The diamond business has long been a cartel , scrupulously controlled since 1910 when the founding father of the De Beers/Anglo-American empire , Ernest Oppenheimer , uttered its cardinal principle : " The only way to increase the value of diamonds is to make them scarce , that is , toreduce production . " Mr. Oppenheimer even seems to have considered dumping tons of diamonds into the North Sea to keep them off the Depression-infected market . Mr. Oppenheimer first pushed to gain and retain control of all producing mines , and then moved forward into cutting , distribution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production sites after others found diamonds on them , entered into synthetic production after others found it feasible , and jumped into investment diamond selling after others showed its promise . Today Harry Oppenheimer  --  Ernest 's son ( who took over in 1957 ) ? controls a network of 300 interlocking corporations . The Oppenheimers habitually purchased land critical to a competitor , then sold the land for shares in the competing firm 's stock , which was swiftly used to take it over . Distribution was controlled by Monty Charles , doling out boxes of diamonds as feudal lords doled out Christmas gifts to their peasants . Each dealer has to take the entire box or none at all ; no price disputes . quality and quantity adjustments . resales or holding back sales information are allowed . Transgressors need not return , while cooperative dealers are blessed with higher quality and greater quantity of stones . These corporate power tactics have met , in Mr. Epstein 's account , with government acquiescence . The British Colonial Office legally or illegally helped De Beers at critical junctures . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Sierra Leone , the Central African Republic , Zaire and Botswana have cooperated closely with the South African firm , even though many have publ. - 'v sworn to boycott South Africa . Even the Kremlin bought the Oppenheimer argument that " a single channel is in the interest of all diamond producers whatever the political difference between them may be . " The Soviets sell De Beers their entire production of uncut diamonds . Mr. Epstein surmises that Moscow may even have pressui ed the Marxist government of Angol ? to keep its diamond mines undercontrol of the firm from its archenemy South Africa . The Soviets have also indirectly marketed their cut diamond supply , " Silver Bears . " through Israeli hands . Mr. Epstein shows how De Beers altered its advertising focus from big diamonds , when faced with a flood of smaller Russian stones in the ** The new emphasis was on a snake-like ring laden with miniature diamonds ; as Mr. Epstein puts it , American wishes were subtly changed to accommodate Soviet supplies to a South African business . Mr. Epstein doubts that scarcity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving . Recent Australian diamond finds have been staggering . with estimated yearly production reaching 50 million carats , equal to current annual production of all De Beers mines . This output will not be under De Beers ' control , and Zairian production may likewise slip away . De Beers has an inventory double that of a couple of years ago , while the public store of diamonds stands at a historic high . Moreover , demand may be busting just as supply is booming . People have bought diamonds for hard-nosed investment as well as starry-eyed romance : diamonds have been hyped as a woman 's best friend and a man 's best investment . Actually , Mr. Epstein shows that diamonds have been a poor investment for years ; a 1970 purchase of a diamond for 400 pounds sterling was sold for a piddling 167 pounds , inflation-adjusted , eight years afterward . According to Mr. Epstein , the benchmark price of a onecarat flawless diamond fell from $63,000 in March 1980 to $23,000 in September 1981 . Mr. Epstein concludes that " the diamond invention will disintegrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant in its way as the glittering , brittle , little stones it once made so valuable . " Little did the urbane Harry Oppenheimer realize during his candid , relaxed interview with Edward Epstein in 1978 just how devastating the result may prove . Mr. Adelman .
