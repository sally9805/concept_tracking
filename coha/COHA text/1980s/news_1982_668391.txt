The four candidates for governor of Massachusetts were interviewed byGlobe reporters last week . This is the second of six articles on that interview . There ' s little or no antibusiness sentiment among this year ' s crop of candidates for governor . The Republican , John W. Sears , says he believes in a " maximum warmth and hospitality to free exterprise . " And he sees " big unions " as being as dangerous to the public as " big business " can be . Democrat Michael S. Dukakis , who was criticized for over- regulating business during his term as governor , says times have changed . He now says there ' s too much regulation of business by state government . But the two long-shot candidates , Independent Francis P. Rich and Libertarian Rebecca Shipman , express even stronger probusiness beliefs . Rich , himself a businessman , says he finds government regulation of business " absolutely abhorrent . " Shipman ' s party believes in a significantly reduced role for government , and so too does its candidate . What she espouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic system . " The four candidates , in a joint interview last week with Globe reporters , discussed their views about business regulation and five other topics . Excerpts from the interview will be run by The Globe throughout this week . Dukakis , asked whether he would do things differently with respect to business , replied : " Obviously , I would do things today that I didn ' t do in 1974 . It ' s a different world . It ' s a world of Proposition 2 1/2 , Reaganomics , of eight years later . " He also said : " What I ' m saying is that it is the job of state government and I believe the job of national government to create a climate for growth and for jobs and sometimes that involves active support and public-private partnerships . " That support , he said , includes a plea by business for government regulation in one area - controlling skyrocketing health care costs . Sears , who has been actively courting the business community that backed Gov . Edward J. King before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions " and " big business " have the clout to " blow the little guy out of the water . " Government , he added , should step in when either of those two entities becomes " cold and careless . " Sears said he and Dukakis differ on their approach to government intervention in the economy . In his view , he said , state government should be used as a catalyst , but not as a " control . " Rich , in his remarks , said he recognized the need for government to regulate such things as utilities " for the common good . " But , he declared , " I want to deregulate as much as possible . I have had government up to my ears . . . " Government , according to Shipman , " should be used only to enforce fraudulent claims against business . I don ' t believe that you should have any a priori regulation of business . " During the interview , Dukakis listed what he said were his administration ' s contributions to the state economy while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took issue with him . Western Electric , said Rich , " moved to New Hampshire because Gov . Dukakis did not have a good business climate . " The company , Dukakis countered , is located in North Andover , Watertown and " in other places . " " No , it isn ' t , " snapped Rich . In fact , it is . John W. Connors , a Western Electric Co. spokesman , confirmed yesterday that his company has plants in North Andover , Watertown , Georgetown and Southborough . Did the company move any facilities to New Hampshire ? No , said Connors , although it opened a temporary facility in Salem , N.H. , during a rapid expansion in 1979 . But that was after Dukakis left office . And , said Connors , it had nothing to do with the state ' s business climate under Dukakis.4 CANDIDATES , 4 VIEWS : WHAT THEY HAD TO SAY Here is what the four candidates for governor had to say in a joint interview at The Globe on the subject of business climate and government regulation:Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government should adopt a laissez-faire approach to regulation of private business and economic activity in general ? In what specific areas do you believe state government must regulate and to what extent ? A. SHIPMAN . The answer to the first question is , yes , I believe that we need very little government control and I believe we need basically a laissez-faire , capitalist economic system . What areas should government regulate ? Very few areas , and I am calling for a significant ( tax* cut of $988 million , and a budget cut of $1.1 billion , in order to begin to institute a significant deregulation of business in Massachusetts . I think that government should be used only to enforce fraudulent claims against business . I don ' t believe that you should have any a priori regulation of business.A . SEARS . At the Harvard Law School , you are welcomed into the community of those wise restraints which make men free . I would say that the root of the answer to your question is a maximum warmth and hospitality to free enterprise , remembering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this over- politicized commonwealth , all too often have clout that is so large that you can blow the little guy out of the water . And that is the role of government . Government must come to the aid of the consumer when business becomes cold and careless , or when unions do . I have no problem seeing that those lines must be drawn.A . RICH . I find government regulation to be absolutely abhorrent to me . However , I recognize that we must have some regulation , such as utilities and those that are for the common good . But why anyone would want to regulate a hairdresser or a barber or anyone in that area , or any technical person , is completely beyond my comprehension . I want to deregulate as much as possible . I have had government up to my ears and as a businessman , I do not want it anymore.A . DUKAKIS . We ' ve had an example in Washington now for the past two years of an administration that thought that by getting out of the way and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I think we ' ve seen what Reaganomics has done to this country and done to this state . And if there is one thing that the next governor of this state has to do , it ' s to work with our congressional delegation and with like- minded governors and other people across this country to change those policies , which are destroying the economies of the older industrial states of this country , including this one . Now , so far as state government is concerned , I don ' t think there ' s an either- or answer here . We ought to get out of those things that we shouldn ' t be regulating , and there are some things we shouldn ' t regulate . On the other hand , I think it ' s interesting that the business community within the past year has taken a very strong leadership position in the effort to get the cost of health care under control . Why ? Because it ' s skyrocketing and because it ' s making the cost of doing business in this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and noncompetitive as the level of taxation or any other cost of doing business . And there I think the next governor , working with the business community and organized labor and the health community , is going to have to use the power of state government to get these costs under control before they bankrupt our businesses and bankrupt our state.A . SHIPMAN . Former governor Dukakis , I think that if you want to run against Reagan for the governor ' s race here , that that ' s perhaps a useful thing to do , but I think you should get your facts straight . When you characterize Reagan as someone who has sat in Washington and done nothing , you lose sight of the fact that he just brought us the biggest tax increase in the history of this nation . So that to characterize his policy as a probusiness policy is , I think , clearly inaccurate . I think that what we need to do is instead of big talk , have big cuts in the size of government so that the economy can once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live their lives as they choose.A . SEARS . Mike may have to worry about having brought us the biggest tax increase in the history of the state . Where I think we differ here is on an attitude towards encouraging things to happen . If you are as upset as I am , and I think Mike Dukakis is , about people out of work , the GM plant in Framingham , either you approach the solution by saying that you favor legislation requiring that domestic car manufacturers buy their parts here in this country , which is government working directly on the producer to solve the problem , or you work out some tax incentives and some temporary relief so that people will be encouraged to buy the products . And I am of the second sort , I think we should use government as a catalyst but not as a control.A . RICH . The comment here has to do really about jobs . I think we have to look jobs in the face . If we create a climate for business that is conducive to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in and they in turn will create jobs , and jobs are the name of the game for this commonwealth . Now it ' s only jobs in a free society , out in the private sector , that can be conducive to handling this whole business climate here . We have a real problem with regard to business and whether we ' re antibusiness or probusiness . And the antibusiness is out there right now , as the Wall Street Journal has said , because Michael Dukakis could possibly be the next governor.A . DUKAKIS . During my four years as governor , we added 246,000 people to the employment rolls of this state , primarily in the private sector . We didn ' t do it with nostrums about Herbert Hoover and the 19th century . We did it with the Copley Places , we did it with the revival of Lowell and we did it by creating something called the Massachusetts Industrial Finance Agency that has financed $1.5 billion worth of industrial expansion at no cost to the state treasury . And these are the building blocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate in this state in half in four years.A . RICH . Western Electric moved to New Hampshire because Gov . Dukakis did not have a good business climate . Excuse me.A . DUKAKIS . Western Electric is in North Andover . And in Watertown . And in other places.A . RICH . No , it isn ' t.Q . Governor , I think it ' s fair to say that a large segment of the business community does not believe that you did well by them in your four years in office . Are they simply wrong , or did you do some things in office that you would do differently now ? A. DUKAKIS . Obviously , I would do things today that I didn ' t do in 1974 . It ' s a different world . It ' s a world of Proposition 2 1/2 , of Reaganomics , of eight years later . The last Republican administration we had left this state with a $600 million deficit and an unemployment rate of over 11 percent , and I was the guy that had to inherit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different time , I hope , from what the next governor will have . I would do some things differently , I would do some things the same . What I ' m saying is that it is the job of state government , and I believe the job of the national government , to create a climate for growth and for jobs , and sometimes that involves active support and public-private partnerships . That ' s how we got Copley Place , the biggest development in the history of this city , and that ' s what produced the miracle of Lowell , which took a city with an unemployment rate of 15 or 16 percent and has made it one of the great urban success stories.A . SEARS . I think it ' s unfortunate to dwell too much on the national economy and not enough on what we can do with peaks and valleys . In fairness to all concerned , Gov . Sargent did not create , but rather a recession in ' 73- ' 74 created , a problem for Gov . Dukakis . The same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exacerbated some of the difficulties we were in then . I would hope that we would focus much more on what we can do locally .
