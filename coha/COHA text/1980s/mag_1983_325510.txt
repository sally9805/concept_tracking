Ros Montt discomfits guerrillas but postpones elections <P> Up to a point , the speech was the kind of bizarre and rambling homily that Guatemalans have come to expect from their born-again military President , Brigadier General Jos Efrain Ros Montt , 56 . As he has almost every Sunday evening since he assumed power in a March 1982 coup , the silver-mustached member of the California-based Christian Church of the Word last week appeared on Guatemalan television to deliver a sermon on patriotism , morality , local politics and the revelations of divine wisdom . He advised citizens against the use of drugs to combat high blood pressure because , he said , it led to impatience . That , in turn , could produce dictatorship , which , Rios Montt declared , " does not work . " <P> Then Ros Montt delivered a minor bombshell . Guatemala , he said , was " not prepared " for democratic elections that he had been vaguely promising for six months . More time was needed , he said , to restore the country 's voter rolls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rulers . Ros Montt also said that the country 's suspended political parties must be reformed , " to coincide with the equitable interests of a majority and with pressures of a minority . " Translation : Ros Montt does not intend to schedule elections until he has created a new party system that he is comfortable with . <P> The general 's remarks came as a surprise to a high-level Guatemalan delegation that was visiting the U.S. Jorge Serrano , president of Ros Montt 's advisory Council of State , had assured a U.S. audience that an election date would be announced no later than March 1984 and that voting would probably take place the following June . Ros Montt 's reversal was " incomprehensible , " said a member of the visiting delegation . " I do n't know what the President had in mind . " <P> The remark echoed the confusion of many Guatemalans . Since he took over-at God 's direction , as he put it-Ros Montt has made far-reaching changes in the brutal and corrupt government that he inherited from his predecessor , General Fernando @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue-and-white posters bearing a favorite Ros Montt slogan , I DO NOT ROB , I DO NOT LIE , I DO NOT ABUSE . Under the President 's moralizing eye , corruption has all but dried up . Government-sanctioned death squads that used to roam the streets of Guatemala City have almost disappeared . Most important , Ros Montt appears to have succeeded , at least temporarily , where the government of neighboring El Salvador has failed : in winning a war against a powerful Marxist insurgency involving an estimated 4,000 guerrillas and their supporters . <P> Only a year ago , the guerrillas controlled vast swatches of territory in at least seven of Guatemala 's 22 departments . Now the number of insurgents has substantially diminished and , says a Western military analyst , " the guerrillas are bleeding . Their cadres are scattered all over the place , and the rest are not willing to pay the price to confront the army . " Many of the guerrillas have fled to safety in southern Mexico .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
