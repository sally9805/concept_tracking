George Santayana , when he was a young philosopher , advanced the thesis that beauty is- but pleasure objectified . Beauty , in this view , exists only in the beholder , as gratification caused by the forms and colors of things . But by some trick of psychology , the beholder is incapable of believing that there is no more to beauty than that , and spontaneously projects the pleasure outward , onto the things that cause it , henceforward treating it as one of their resident features . It is an ingenious theory , with an irresistible tang of paradox which insures that it will be disputed in esthetics seminars forever , though its author abandoned it almost immediately . Paradox . or not , the forced conjunction of an inner state and an outer reality characterizes to perfection the heady atmosphere of Paris in the final decade of the nineteenth century , the Belle Epoque . Pleasure was palpable in the life of , the boulevards , and it remains palpable in the depictions of that life in the great graphic work of Henri de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art until January 26 . One can not enter the galleries that house the famous and familiar posters without feeling , almost as a physical presence , the dense effluvia of sensual pleasure they distill : champagne , absinthe and dubonnet , rice powder and patchouli , dancers in frilled drawers and black stockings executing the manic steps of the quadrille , sports and boulevardiers in frock coats and opera hats , white-aproned waiters rushing heavy trays of foie gras and oysters to debauchees , the abandoned cadences of drums and violins , tipsy girls and whirling couples of various sexes , racehorses and bareback riders  --  a brothel world of infinite ecstatic promise . The chemistry of Lautrec 's spicy imagery confirms the celebrated discovery of Marcel Proust that an entire reality stands latent in even a dish of tea , ready to be unfurled to consciousness and memory . The posters , his masterpieces , after all participated in the reality they also represent , which is perhaps why they bring , along with its arabesque forms and chromatic dissonances , the sounds and smells and even some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dance halls or theaters seems to cast pools of decadent luminescence on the antiseptic floors of the museum 's chill interior , a false but welcome warmth . This was , after all , advertising art , plastered against the walls of fin de siecle Paris , on its kiosks or behind the bars in its brasseries and caf  --  s , and was meant to arouse appetite and awaken desire . So even today , seeing the spectacular poster for the Moulin Rouge which brought Lautrec overnight celebrity in 1891 , we want to go there , to see with our own eyes La Goulue flashing her magnificent ' behind , while her perfect partner , physiologically improbable , claps an appreciative rhythm . Even the lettering is seductive : " Moulin Rouge " repeated three times in the upper left corner , like a drum beat , in red letters against the pale , intoxicating chartreuse tint of watered pastis . The name is repeated once more , lower down , this time describing a sweet curve , almost dancing with La Goulue , whose complicated white underwear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tinier letters , like , a naughty whisper , " Tous les soirs " points to the V between her sexy legs . In the farther distance are silhouetted patrons in night-life headgear  --  toppers and feathered hats  --  forming a circle which curves forward , to include us as part of its circumference . So we are , in a sense , half there already , inside and outside the picture at once . La Goulue dances her abandoned fling wherever the poster is shown . It obliterates , or at least makes ambiguous , the space between depicted viewers and real viewers . And the pleasure is made present in the art that objectifies it . The poster is inherently an evanescent form , not intended to outlast the event that occasions it  --  an exhibition , a performance , an appearance , a fete . It is perfectly emblematic that the painter of pleasure , itself inherently evanescent , should have chosen for his most characteristic statements surfaces as fleeting as the sensations they advertised . It must have been a marvelous thing to awake one morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montmartre or the rue de Clichy , fresh from the bill-sticker , urging you to hasten to the Moulin Rotige , forming an escort . It is with Lautrec as with those short-lived species that spawn prodigiously and survive by sheer force of numbers . If one is going to work in ephemera , lithography is the medium of choice , facilitating vast editions with minimal degeneration of impression , and insuring that some exemplars have a chance of making it to the shores of the future . Posters , but also theater programs , menus , announcements of art shows , leaflets with various functions , album covers , ' throwaway entities all , have somehow defied their natural condition of gay brevity to be preserved for connoisseurs of graphic art in its highest embodiment . The line between high and commercial art , between utilitarian and contemplative art , is boisterously erased in the radiance of Lautrec'sr achievement . It democratizes hedonism . There is an invitation which Lautrec designed for a famous party thrown in February 1895 by Alexandre Natanson , publisher of La revue blanche , summoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invitation is written in English ) of " American and other drinks " at " 8 h. 1/2 . " Lautrec was barman on that remembered evening , wearing the American flag for a waistcoat , and with his head shaved . According to the wonderful biography of the celebrated Misia Sert ( whom Lautrec loved to draw ) by Arthur Gold and Robert Fizdale , he " invented monstrous cocktails in layers of bright green , red , and yellow liquors . " They . extract this passage from a contemporary account : Lautrec 's imagination was inexhaustible . After a series of drinks which had to be swallowed in one gulp , there followed a gamut of pink cocktails , undreamt of concoctions which had to be sipped slowly through a straw . . . . He also compounded substantial cocktails of sardines in gin or port : he would set these aflame in a long silver dish , And before long they would be scorching the throats of the unwary . . . . There were also prairie oysters , their palatability unimproved by cayenne pepper . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests , all of them on the Natansons ' floor when the bar finally shut down . For me , this episode expresses his artistic personality totally : a witty concoctor , a demonic juxtapositioner . Gold and Fizdale speak of " the great colorist running amok at the bar . " He ran amok , in just that way , over the immense stones on which he drew his images . Bright green , yellow , red : these were the colors of his world , migrating from the bright bodices of the Moulin Rouge to the cocktail glass to the lithographic stones to the brilliant sheets which would be pasted all across the city the next morning . He is present , as such , in each of his works . Consider , once more , the Moulin Rouge poster , and our privileged view of La Goulue 's behind . The shown bottom is universally recognized as a gesture of mildly obscene defiance : I once read that the women of Lagos lifted their skirts and aimed their aggregated behinds at the governmental palace as an unmistakable gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt and placed her as he has in a spirit that must be seen as impudent and provocative , establishing an instant complicity between himself and us . The poster is a cocktail of sly signals , and ripples with suppressed laughter . The lettering , like regimented balloons , goes with the comic topknot on La Goulue 's head ; with the foolish polka dots like clumsy bubbles across her blouse ; and with the salient Adam 's ? apple of her dancing partner , Valentin Le Desosse ( " Valentin the Boneless " ) , a man so skinny as to verge on insubstantiality , allowing Lautrec to flatten him into a prancing shadow . In the Divan Japonais poster , he slices off the face and features of Yvette Guilbert , whose long gloves suffice to identify her , and puts us in the loge with Jane Avril , tapping her fan to the music . In the drawing Poor Streetwalker ! of 1893 , the client is reduced to a mere hand , leading the resigned woman , with her pathetic fur piece , out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hand is restored to its owner , but he loses his face and half his hat to the edge of the sheet . The cropped form , the poignant edge , the meaningful angle of vision , the improbable proportion , insinuate a language of commentary and observation between the image and us . To master the language is to learn what we are meant to feel and how we are meant to see the subject . He is manipulating it for himself and for us , and we are always conscious of him : he has made himself invisible to the subject in order to make the subject visible to us . This is particularly the case with his pictures of prostitutes . He is known to have lived for various periods in whorehouses , something I suppose easily arranged with the infinitely accommodating madams of those establishments , prepared to cater to stranger preferences on the part of their moneyed clientele . As a fellow tenant , he became at last so familiar to the women that they paid him as little attention as they would a maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to take for granted . Before Lautrec 's gaze they were , simply , themselves . He represents them in unguarded moments , when they are vulnerable and unbuttoned , bending awkwardly over a tub , or unfastening a cor-set , or vacantly combing their hair , or sleeping deeply with their undefended breasts exposed , or gazing into a mirror wondering hoW to restore enough of their looks to turn the next sou , or lying , exhausted and used , after having turned the last one . I love the painting , not shown here , of the salon on the rue des Moulins , where the women are chastely deployed on hassocks and ottomans in the garments of their trade , facing the implied entrance , awaiting custom . " They loll about on sofas like animals , " he once commented , but it was a kindly , affectionate remark , for he adored animals and adored drawing them , and the women have the inextinguishable and hopeful patience of dogs . In one of the prints a stately proprietress , wearing a look of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a young girl , clearly now the star of the establishment , who grins wickedly past her at the artist . In another print the same two women face one another across the length of the bed , like two stages of the same woman facing herself across the waste of years . It would have been simple for Lautrec , who had a caricaturist 's malice , to make the heavy woman look ridiculous or hateful . So we are aware of the restraint , and hence of his humanity and compassion . But sometimes he lets an expression stand , which-it would have been merciful to alter . In an 1891 painting on cardboard La Goulue is shown in the Moulin Rouge , supported on either side by a woman friend . Her bodice is disheveled , and she wears a look of dissolute stupidity . Her eyes are crossed , her mouth sour . She is perhaps too drunk to see the artist facing her . In showing us La Goulue with her defenses'down , he is not showing us a defenseless woman , as in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movingly tender . " Look at her ! " the artist seems to say . Lautrec is always pointing things out to us , for our amusement or edification . Lautrec constructed his compositions as he built his cocktails . He counted on different viscosities , in the latter case , to keep colors from bleeding into one another , and on some corresponding chemistry of optical display to allow the undiluted intensity of colored planes to work together . He functioned like a sort of prism , refracting pure hues out of the chromatic jumble that meets the eye . The oil sketch The Englishman at the Moulin Rouge , of 1892 , shows- the subject in full-dress regalia , his florid complexion set off by the poisonous green behind his head , his frock coat made up of blue-green strokes in the manner of late Impressionism , his red lower lip protruding- so aggressively that the red-haired cocotte seems to be recoiling from it . The entire atmosphere is of flickering lights , artificial and cruel , and of ' a certain boozy vagueness . In the lithograph of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study , there are more severe separations and reductions . The Englishman is now an undifferentiated plane of mauve , like a fragment of Tiffany glass . The wall of the dance hall has become a plane of chrome yellow , like another such fragment . The image has the bold reductiveness of stained glass ; and while there can be little doubt that the procedure echoes the separation of colors-required by lithography  --  one color per stone , more or less ? Lautrec may have taken a step , in treating the subject as so many planes of color , in the direction of what became Cubism . When Cezanne said , abruptly , in regard to the relative merits of Lautrec and Degas , " I prefer Lautrec , " it was because he saw in this artist an enterprise of formal analysis ' kindred to his own . Of all the modalities of pleasure objectified in this - exhibition , none is greater than the intense pleasure the artist took in his own extraordinary powers ? in the unparalleled gifts of ' reflex and grace his aristocratic forebears discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draftsmanly touch with a perhaps unique visual understanding . Lautrec knew how to show anything from any angle ; he had a gift for perspectival transposition analogous to a musician 's gift for transposing melodies from , , key to key . It is as though he could rotate ' scene in his mind 's eye until just the angle he required turned up  --  and then draw it from memory . After all , as ' he stood over a stone , the scene he meant to depict was far away or vanished . There is a famous set of drawings he did in 1899 , in a sanitarium , to demonstrate that he was in control of himself and compos mend 's : thirty scenes of circuses , with rearing horses and poised riders , animal tamers and acrobats , all made as an exercise in perfect visual recall . He simply knew how things had to look , from above or below , in order to be convincing , and though we too may have that competence , since we are visually convinced , no one else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is his signature . Beyond that there is the immediacy with which he swept an image onto the surface of the stone and , after having laid down his initial statement , found a way to fit the rest of the scene around it , cropping ruthlessly : condensing , severe- ly , augmenting in that manner ' the energies of the central figure . In one poster , the entertainer Caudieux fills a space too small for his flailing limbs , forcing all his energy back from the edges of the sheet . My favorite work is a poster of 1896 showing the troupe of Mlle. Eglantine : four dancing women in superb hats , five and a quarter purple legs sticking out of a cascading sweep of petticoats as urgent as the great Wave of Hokusai . Alongside Lautrec , every artist looks static . There is more energy in a square inch of his drawings than in any six square blocks in Soho . Of course he was tethered to an inadequate body : dwarfed , ailing , alcoholic , syphilitic , homely , drooling . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he met an early death . ' Anyone who feels that is the whole story is blind to the wit , the good nature , the motor ecstasy of the work . The world of the happy man and the world of the sad man are not alike , Wittgenstein remarked . This is the world of the happy man . The show - is pleasure , objectified. ?
