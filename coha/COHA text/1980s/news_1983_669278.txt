The beach is deserted , but the surf is alive with the colorful wet suits and sun-bleached fringes of 50 Edison High School students . They slice , with varying degrees of success , across the green faces of waves on bullet-shaped fiber-glass boards. // Playing tag with the foamy fingers of the breakers , they curl up , stretch out , or contort to any configuration that will scoot them on their surfboards just ahead , but not too far ahead , of the curl . Ultimately they are either delivered gently ashore or pounded straight to the bottom as their surfboards rocket high into the salt spray. // It ' s as vigorous a PE class as any student has , and it ' s as Californian as baseball and football are American. // ' ' This gives kids a reason to go to school . Nine years ago , we couldn ' t get them out of the water to come to school , ' ' so the surfing classes and a team were started , says Mr. Rothrock . He ' s a shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Scholastic Surfing Association which promotes student competition. // The NSSA is the latest evidence of the maturing of the sport so closely linked with images of youthful abandon . The association is part of a more sophisticated approach that has given surfing a more polished edge . Surfing is a big business - multimillion-dollar sales in equipment , fashion , magazines - and promoters are doing what they can to clean up its image . The surfers of the 1960s are the adults of today , who , never tiring of the sport , are lending legitimacy to surfing as well as a guiding hand in the business and public relations aspects of forging a new image. // The lure of the waves is not unfamiliar to Rothrock , a tanned remnant of the first American generation of ' 60s surfers . If the boards are shorter , the surfers younger , and the waves more crowded , the lure is still the same - the sun , the air , the freedom , and the thrill of merging with the power of a wave. // It is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1966 newspaper piece ' ' The Pumphouse Gang . ' ' His account of the free-spirited , though sometimes directionless , surfers and the satellite community orbiting around them sunk the Gidget and Beach Blanket Bingo image . And it is quintessentially Californian that high school teacher Rothrock would be holding classes , for academic credit , every day of the school year out here where surf meets sand. // Surfing and the mystique surrounding it endure as a subculture along the ribbon of California coastline , a subculture that draws people to it who may never have seen a beach , yet who adopt its wind-swept , laid-back style . It has evolved as a youth phenomenon , but now its first generation has matured , adopting adult concerns of legitimacy and earning a living . For some , surfing has been their bread and butter and they are treating it as a business - doing market surveys of the world ' s 4 million surfers ( more than a million are in southern California ) , selling $600 million worth of surfing equipment and fashions annually , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s going to be a dramatic change in the image of surfing , ' ' says Ian Cairns , an Australian former world champion who has pioneered surfing promotion in the United States . He runs the Association of Surfing Professionals , which has pumped enough money into world-class competition to earn last year ' s world champion $125 , 000 in prize and promotional money . He also runs the National Scholastic Surfing Association , which promotes amateur competition designed to keep enthusiastic young surfers in school. // Mr. Cairns notes that the traditional image of surfers has been that of ' ' dopers , dropouts , surf Nazis . ' ' In the early ' 60s surfers were on the experimental fringe of southern California life styles . With its popularity , surfing grew but was never quite a legitimate sport as , say , the school-sanctioned sports of football or baseball . Without that endorsement , anyone bent on surfing had to focus his attentions outside the scholastic structure , catching the waves when they were good , rather than when they fit around English or math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfers grew as its popularity did . Resources - ocean waves - were limited ; and in the squeeze , crowding caused outbreaks of territorial violence on the waves , a kind of free-fire zone where policing is almost impossible. // ' ' We saw the same image problems in Australia . . . it was never properly promoted . But a positive attitude brought a different media involvement and now surfing is accepted as kind of a career . . . surfers aren ' t considered outcasts , ' ' Cairns says . He concludes that ' ' what happened in Australia is going to happen here . We ' re trying to promote a clean-cut , good image. ' ' // Chuck Allen spends his mornings , before going to work as a vice-president of a savings-and-loan , just up the beach from Rothrock ' s class . Mr. Allen coaches Huntington Beach High School ' s surf team . At 46 , he says , his love of surfing is seasoned with the perspective of an adult that teens don ' t have when faced with leaving good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classroom . ' ' I talk to the kids and tell them to get an education and a good job and then they can ( afford to ) surf in a style they like. ' ' // Surfing coaches are using NSSA as a means for giving students the incentive to stay in school . The association has recruited enough top talent to make its amateur competitions some of the most respected in the world . The national team travels to compete in places like Bali , Australia , and Hawaii . But the teen-agers - mostly boys , but a growing contingent of girls - can not compete at any level of competition if they are not passing all their courses. // ' ' This helps present surfing to the adult community , ' ' explains Rothrock . ' ' The sport these kids love has had negative social connotations . Some kids used to have to sneak out of the house to do it . But it ' s a very postive athletic activity - like ballet ; it involves individual expression . ' ' The surfer ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Their environment is very fluid . They spend time looking at weather reports or satellite pictures , ' ' and because good surfing conditions don ' t respect school schedules , students find it tempting to skip class , he says . Organized competition provides the structure for a more stable approach to the sport. // Surfing industry sources , from promoters to magazine editors and teachers , point to the return of the old guard to surfing . While many never left the beach , college and career plans took others away from the sport . But now , success has brought some back . The most famous among them is Hobie Alter , whose design and marketing genius have made him a fortune off the surf . ( He created the Hobie Cat catamaran , for example. ) // ' ' More people at the executive level are coming out of the closet , ' ' says Ian Cairns , laughing . ' ' Previously it wouldn ' t have been too cachet ( for a middle-aged businessman ) to tell anyone he ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regularly surf notice older surfers are returning . Some speculate it is because success has given them the time to take off and surf when the waves are good or to travel to far-off places to find good surf . This , too , feeds a better image for the sport , says Cairns. // From the ' ' hang 10 ' ' days , when big 10-foot boards gave surfers enough weight at the rear of their boards to inch forward and hang 10 toes over the front , to today ' s shorter , speedier boards and the preference for top-of-the-wave stunts , the lure of the surf has consistently attracted new hordes of youth into the sport . This was happening even before the new stylized business approach brought about the package of public relations , magazines boasting some of the slickest design and most sophisticated photography in publishing , and all the peripheral equipment such as wet suits , surfboard leashes , stylish swimsuits and sportswear spinoffs of the surfing culture. // Once you ' ve been gripped by the excitement of surfing , surfers say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its image . As the Beach Boys sing it in their falsetto style , ' ' Catch a wave and you ' re sittin ' on top of the world. ' ' // Brian Clisby , a 17-year-old Edison High School student scheduled to surf in the NSSA national team competition in Japan and Bali this summer , has been surfing for four years . Face flushed from the salty ocean and wet suit heavy with water , the towhead looks perplexed , as if there should be no doubt , when asked what compels him to surf . ' ' Besides skiing , it ' s the funnest thing I do , ' ' he says. // Surfing ' s appeal is captured more from photographs taken right from the bottom of a wave than from onshore . Recognizing this , David Gilovich , editor of Surfing magazine and a surfer himself , has built the circulation of his magazine to 85 , 000 . Distributed in corners of the United States and the rest of the world that don ' t even have a coastline , the magazine captures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tube of a wave , or racing to beat the edge of the breaking wave , or riding perpendicular to the board as it hits the wave ' s crest. // ' ' Once you ' re a surfer , it ' s pretty much a life style . . . the ocean , the freedom of the beach , ' ' says Gilovich , who at 31 has surfed for nearly 20 years . ' ' It ' s really much more than a physical sport . Anyone can pick it up and if they give it time they ' re going to have that one moment , that greatest moment of their life and the reward is so great , ' ' that each wave holds new fascination for a potential thrill. // Another aspect of surfing ' s appeal , he continues , is the relatively low cost . ' ' There ' s no lift ticket or green fees , ' ' he points out . The average retail price on the 100 , 000 , 6-foot , 2-inch boards sold last year was $330 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doesn ' t even require a wet suit , Surfer market research shows. // Market research estimates show that California has 1. 3 million surfers , Gilovich says . But that number , he adds , puts a squeeze on the finite amount of wave resources those surfers have . And that has been the source of the sport ' s biggest problem here in southern California , where territoriality has caused fights between youths staking claim to certain surfing areas. // ' ' The best thing is to be able to ride a wave alone , ' ' Gilovich explains , but that isn ' t always easy to work out when 40 or 50 surfers are bobbing for hours just beyond the wave break , waiting to compete for that one swell promising a good ride . As surfers have grown accustomed to the situation , they have reluctantly hashed out an etiquette of the waves , and hostilities have been reduced , he says. // While the heaviest surfing turnout is on weekends , the best time , surfers agree , is in the early morning when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the waves and holding them up for a perceptible moment longer . The most avid surfers find that there are fewer people out at that time , especially midweek , to compete with for the waves. // The effects of this winter ' s stormy weather in California were not all bad . Surfers found much more challenging surf rolling in off the ocean during the past winter . And the belief within the surfing community is that with an expected trend of more stormy weather due here , there should be less crowding . As waves break more frequently , surfers will have more waves to ride. // //
