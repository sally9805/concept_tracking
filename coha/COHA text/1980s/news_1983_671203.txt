In baseball or any sport , most famous teams gradually separate , if not disintegrate . But the phrase has kept the Boys of Summer tied together. // They don ' t see one another that often . But they are always thought of as a group . Mention one and you mention the others . Baseball oldtimers talk about the 1927 Yankees as having had a similar group identity , but only a few are still alive. // Now those Boys of Summer have been spliced together for a charming and compelling two-hour television special produced and written by Marty Bell. // As they talk of their time , they are seen occasionally in old black-and-white film as they were then , but mostly as they are now . Pee Wee Reese inspecting bats in the Louisville Slugger factory . Duke Snider broadcasting a Montreal Expos game . Roy Campanella being lifted out of his wheelchair into the front seat of an automobile . Carl Furillo acknowledging he has leukemia . Carl Erskine swimming with his retarded son . Preacher Roe showing how he doctored his spitball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive . Clem Labine putting an arm around his son who lost a leg in Vietnam. // In the decade since Roger Kahn revisited the Boys of Summer for the book , Jackie Robinson has died . So has Gil Hodges , so has Billy Cox . Even so , Jackie Robinson remains the most dominating personality on the TV show , just as he was on the team . More than anyone else , Jackie Robinson gave those Dodgers their identity as the " Jackie Robinson Dodgers , " the first integrated major league baseball team . But in one of Roger Kahn ' s lines that is repeated on the show by the host , Sid Caesar , nobody went to Ebbets Field for sociology. // " I don ' t know what made it different , " Pee Wee Reese says on the show of having played in Brooklyn then , " but it was . " One element that made it different was the rivalry with the New York Giants , who later went to San Francisco for the 1958 season as passengers in Walter O ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same league in the same city a subway ride apart who played 22 games against each other every season . That ' s a rivalry. // " We hated the Giants , " recalls Carl Furillo , " we just hated the uniform . " After the 1956 season , the Dodgers dared to trade Jackie Robinson to the Giants for Dick Littlefield , a left-handed pitcher , and $30 , 000 , a fairly substantial sum then . But rather than report , Jackie Robinson retired from baseball ; the deal was canceled. // " Of all people , the Giants , " remembers Pee Wee Reese with a sneer . " I ' d have been disappointed if he ' d gone . Glad he didn ' t go. " // Another element that made it different was that , until 1955 , those Dodgers lost four World Series to another neighbor , the Yankees . " Billy Martin , now he was a mediocre hitter , " Carl Furillo says of the Yankee second baseman who batted . 500 with a record 12 hits in the 1953 World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediocre hitter . Yet when he played us in Ebbets Field , I think he hit two doubles or two triples into right-center field. " // In old film , Carl Furillo is seen fielding balls at Ebbets Field off the scoreboard and the angled right-field wall . " They used to give a suit to anybody who ' d hit that sign , " Pee Wee Reese says , referring to the Abe Stark clothing sign at the base of the scoreboard . " But Furillo played right in front of it . Nobody ever hit it. " // Some of the Boys chide Duke Snider , now a Hall of Famer , for not having been an even better player . " I once asked him , ' Why don ' t you charge those ground balls ? These guys don ' t even hesitate at second base , ' " Pee Wee Reese says . " He said , ' I was an infielder when I was younger and I hated those ground balls and I still hate ' em. ' " // " He could ' ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Clem ' s right , " Duke Snider says . Preacher Roe , now doing public relations for a West Plains , Mo. , bank after years of owning a food market there , stands in his backyard with a baseball as if he suddenly needed to throw his spitball for a strike. // " When you touch your hat , " he says , " that ' s when you could get it and put it on your hand. " // But like the book , much of the show is concerned with what makes the men , for better or for worse . Of Clem Labine ' s search for the love of his son . Jay Labine ' s resentment of living in his father ' s shadow as a youngster almost slashes the TV screen when he says , " I didn ' t pitch for the damn Dodgers , I ' m me . " As he talks about it , Clem Labine weeps. // Of Joe Black , married five times , being with his 12-year-old daughter as she practices long jumps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , " he says . " The next time they look they say , ' I didn ' t know you were 14 . ' " Of Carl Erskine , now the president of an Indiana bank , trying without success to teach his retarded son , Jimmy , to say , " No , thank you " to others instead of grunting . One day Jimmy did something that merited a spanking. // " I took him upstairs , " Carl Erskine says , " He looked at me . He said , ' No , thank you . ' " Of Roy Campanella , smiling in his wheelchair as he remembered the auto accident on a slippery street near his Glen Cove , L.I. , home that ended his Hall of Fame career before he could resume it in Los Angeles. // " I wanted to play in the Coliseum , " he says , referring to where the team played before Dodger Stadium was completed .
