People around Neunkirchen , the Saarland coal-mining town where Erich Honecker was born 75 years ago , remember him as a serious-minded boy who passed out political newspapers after school at age ten and shunned religion class as a matter of working-class principle . " He did n't play with us in recess or go swimming in the summer , " recalls Kurt Humbs , 76 , a classmate in nearby Wiebelskirchen , where Honecker grew up . " Sometimes , " he adds , " you had the impression you were looking into a mirror with no glass in it . " <P> Humbs and his neighbors will have another chance to look into the mirror next week . Fifty-two years after he left Neunkirchen , now part of West Germany , and twelve years after he became the bland but politically nimble leader of Communist East Germany , Honecker is scheduled to make a five-day visit to his homeland . His host will be West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl , and a lot more than nostalgia will be in the air . Postponed earlier as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the trip will mark the first time an East German party leader has set foot in West Germany , and only the second time since the two countries were created nearly 40 years ago that leaders of both have met face-to-face on German soil . <P> Honecker 's visit repays a trip made to East Germany by then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt in 1981 . The East German leader 's plans for a reciprocal visit fell victim to a freeze in superpower relations in 1984 , after West Germany had decided to deploy U.S. cruise and Pershing II missiles and the Soviets , in response , had walked out of arms negotiations in Geneva . Criticized in the Soviet press for planning to carry out his trip despite Bonn 's move , Honecker dutifully canceled at the last minute . His arrival in West Germany now is one more sign of how U.S.-Soviet relations have improved . <P> The trip also underscores the change in intra-German relations . For years the two states were bitter cold war enemies , unable to reach even a basic agreement recognizing each other 's de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ separated by an 863-mile border bristling with armed patrols and barbed wire , the two states have settled into a wary but increasingly pragmatic relationship , held together by more than 70 bilateral agreements governing everything from postal communications to electricity sharing . " German-German relations used to be much worse than East-West relations in general , " says Wolfgang Berner , deputy director of Cologne 's Federal Institute for East European and International Studies . " This has changed . " While no small part of that change is due to West German bridge building , Honecker has in recent years also grown more flexible .
