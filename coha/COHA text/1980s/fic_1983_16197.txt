I do n't know why , but I just could n't turn that key . 23 ANGLE While McPhearson watches with cool professional interest , Beringer betrays a certain uneasiness . &nbsp; PSYCHIATRIST ( V. O. ) Maybe this time you considered the moral consequences . &nbsp; JERRY ( V. O. ) Like I say , I just do n't know . Section Details 24 INT .

But , the man you saw was typical . &nbsp; CABOTYou say they all had good or even excellent service records ? &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERWe do n't just pull men out of the ranks . Every single one of those men has an excellent record . It 's an honor to be a Missile Commander .  --  14  --  &nbsp; CABOTWell then , the honor has damn little meaning . Eighteen percent of your men failed . . . or worse yet . . . refused to launch . Beringer nervously lights a cigar . &nbsp; WATSONThank God it was only a test . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERI 've ordered a complete review of screening procedures . We 've called in some top men from the Meninger Clinic and . . . &nbsp; CABOTFor Christ sake Jack , I ca n't tell the President we 're trying to solve a disaster in our national defense with a team of headshrinkers . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERWe have men who are not flawed and who will obey orders without hesitation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CABOTThere is no way to guarantee that the new men wo n't fail just like the other men did . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGER ( getting hot ) Are you saying that in the entire Air Force we do n't have men capable of a missile command ? &nbsp; CABOTI 'm not taking shots at the Air Force . The caliber of all men in uniform has seriously deteriorated over the last ten years . . . I know that and you know that . . . Now , how the shit do we solve this problem ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONWhy do n't we simply take the men out of the loop ?  --  15  --  &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERGet rid of the Missile Commanders ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONSure . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERWe ca n't take those men out of the capsules . . . They 're the final link in our fail-safe system . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONAnd the weakest link in our defense . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERWell , I 'm against altering our system in any way that reduces human control . . . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONWe 'll only reduce human error . You 'll still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; CABOT ( after a short beat ) Would the elimination of these men in any way reduce our effectiveness ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONI think eliminating these men would improve it . 25 INT .

It projects Soviet responses to our responses . . . our responses to their responses and so on . . . uh , it gets kind of confusing . &nbsp; WATSONHow do you tell who wins ? &nbsp; REINERUh , well , it counts the dead . . . estimates damage . Then , it looks for ways to improve our score in the next war . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONIt has already fought World War III , I do n't know how many times . Nobody in our military can match it for nuclear war experience .  --  17  --  &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERI 'd like to point out that this machine acts only as an advisor . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONWe all know the time imperative of nuclear war . If we detect the launch of a Soviet land based missile , it will impact in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-launched would be here in six . Only this machine could give us a planned response , complete with launch timings and target selections within seconds . Cabot turns to McPhearson , clearly sympathetic . &nbsp; CABOTAnd right now , this trillion dollar system is at the mercy of those men with the little brass keys . &nbsp; MCPHEARSON ( nods ) In a matter of weeks we could replace them with simple electronic relays . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERRelays are not trained officers , capable of making judgmental decisions . &nbsp; CABOTJack , we 're looking for a solution , it 's important that everyone 's views be heard on this . . . I 'll brief the President , and I think Dr. McPhearson should come back to Washington with us and elaborate on his suggestion . &nbsp; MCPHEARSON ( swelling ) Certainly . I 'd be happy to do that .  --  18  --  Beringer looks on with barely concealed annoyance . Watson approaches the machine . &nbsp; WATSONMay I touch it ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONCertainly . Cabot watches as Watson runs his hand over the gray surface of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick look with Pat . &nbsp; WATSONSo this is where Armageddon is played ?

BRIEFING ROOM A harried Paul Reiner stands in front of a blackboard talking to General Beringer , Cabot , and GEORGE WIGAN , a tall , patrician man in civilian clothes . &nbsp; CABOTYou 're telling me that anyone can just pick up the phone and penetrate your system ? &nbsp; REINER ( nervously ) No , sir , not as a rule . Apparently an installer from the phone company spliced a regular phone line from one of our data collection sites in Sunnyvale , California , onto one of our secure data lines here . Normally our system can only be accessed internally . &nbsp; CABOTHow could this happen ? &nbsp; REINER ( shrugs ) Let 's face it , we 're dealing with the phone company .  --  63  --  118 ANGLE McPhearson enters the back of the room . Reiner sees him with apparent relief . &nbsp; CABOTJohn , good to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . George came in with me from Washington . He 's with the Office of Special Investigations . McPhearson exchanges greetings with Wigan and nods to the General , who stares back and says nothing . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONSo , I understand we have some kind of high school prank on our hands . &nbsp; REINERI was just explaining how the kid got in through a remote node in Sunnyvale . &nbsp; WIGANHe claims he was looking for a toy company . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONNobody just dials his way into the war games subsystem . Even if he managed to get on line , there are five levels of passwords . . . &nbsp; REINERHe apparently got in through a back door using Falken 's personal password . Nobody knew it was still in there . General Beringer can barely hold his temper . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERHow could something like that be in there without you knowing about it ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONJack , out of ten thousand rounds of ammunition , one or more is going to be a dud . . . But , nobody knows where it is until you try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bits of information . ( MORE )  --  64  --  &nbsp; MCPHEARSON ( CONT 'D . ) We remove bugs when we find them . ( to Reiner ) Have we located the password ? &nbsp; REINERYes , the kid actually told us . . . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONAll right then . It should n't take more than a few hours to have it purged from the system and be back on line with full capacity . &nbsp; CABOTTaking out that password does n't solve the problem . Your system is vulnerable to seventeen year old boys with home computers . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONLet 's not forget , this intruder was discovered and caught within a matter of hours because of the security capabilities of that system . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERAnd how many times was he in there before you even noticed him ? How many others have been in there ? Can you tell me that ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONThere 's no reason to think there have been any penetrations other than this single episode . &nbsp; GENERAL BERINGERIn other words , you do n't know . There is an awkward silence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONBased on what ? &nbsp; WIGANThe Lightman boy fits the profile perfectly . He 's intelligent , but an underachiever . He seems alienated  --  65  --  from his parents . . . has few friends . . . a classic case for recruitment by the Soviets . &nbsp; CABOTI ca n't go to the President with raw conjecture . We 've got to find out exactly what the hell that kid was doing . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONI agree . I 'd like to speak with him . . . On my own . Cabot glances at McPhearson . &nbsp; CABOT ( a beat ) I think you should John , I think this whole unfortunate incident clearly falls into your area of responsibility . ( sits back in his chair ) What a lousy commentary on our country . George , have you gotten any insight as to why a bright boy like this could become so disillusioned that he 'd jeopardize the lives of millions ? &nbsp; WIGANThe little prick says he does this sort of thing for fun . pp. 22-43 &nbsp; pp. 66-85 119 INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enters . A burly Air Police Sergeant stands at the door . David looks haggard and scared as McPhearson faces him . His hands are cuffed . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONHello , David . I 'm John McPhearson . I run the computer facility here . David nods . &nbsp; MCPHEARSON ( to guard ) Can you get these cuffs off him ? . . . David , I called your parents . . . I told them you 're fine and that we  --  66  --  have n't filed any charges yet . . . But , I also told them that we will need a little time to sort this whole thing out . &nbsp; DAVIDHow much time ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONThat mainly depends on how well you cooperate . Why do n't we take a walk ? McPhearson notes a look of hesitation in David 's face . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONLook , I 'm not with the FBI or anything like that . . . I 'm like you , I 'm into computers . David nods and follows . 120 INT . NORAD CORRIDORS McPhearson leads David down a stairwell towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with Stephen Falken , did n't you ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONThat 's right . I started out as his assistant . Who told you that ? &nbsp; DAVIDI read an article you wrote with him on poker and nuclear war . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONHow did you happen to read that ? &nbsp; DAVIDI read everything I could about Falken when I was trying to find the password . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONI glanced over the arrest report . You have a pretty advanced system for a hobbyist.  --  67  --  &nbsp; DAVIDI 've been building it for a couple of years . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONWhere did you get the money ? &nbsp; DAVIDIt 's all used equipment . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONIt still costs money . Where did you get it ? &nbsp; DAVIDSome I saved from my allowance . Last summer I worked at Radio Shack . Oh , and I sold my coin collection . . . You know anything about coins ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONNo . McPhearson is silent as they walk . &nbsp; DAVID ( after a beat ) My terminal 's an old Altair . . . If I were a spy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up with a new Hewlitt-Packard ? CAMERA FAVORING McPhearson as he glances at David . He smiles , friendly . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONNot necessarily . They walk on . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONBeyond the issue of espionage , you have a device for cheating the phone company . Do n't you ? &nbsp; DAVIDI hardly ever use it . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONJust possessing it is a felony that could get you ten years in prison .  --  68  --  David does n't answer . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONI spotted it on the list of equipment . . . Fortunately , the FBI passed it over . . . McPhearson allows a few seconds of suspenseful silence . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONI do n't want to make things any worse for you David , so , for the moment , we 'll just let it be . &nbsp; DAVIDThanks .

McPhearson pauses at the SIOP machine . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONMeet your opponent . This machine runs the Falken game program . David runs his hand over the well-worn metal surface . &nbsp; DAVIDYou never throw anything away , do you ? &nbsp; MCPHEARSONFalken designed the programs for this machine . . . it still works beautifully . Of course , we 've since increased the memory and execution speed considerably . David glances at the machine . &nbsp; DAVIDHe must have been pretty amazing . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONStephen had the most powerful mind I 've ever encountered , but I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McPhearson faces David as he wanders around the machine . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONA sense of reality is important , David . David is silent , wondering what McPhearson is after . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONFor example , if I were you . I 'd be thinking very hard about how to get myself out of this mess . David stares back at McPhearson . Fear begins building in him .  --  70  --  &nbsp; DAVIDI 've told them everything I know . . . What else can I do ? McPhearson looks at him neither accepting nor rejecting . David 's statement . Then , he smiles , suddenly disarming . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONHungry ? . . . Let 's go to my office . We can order in something to eat . David nods . He walks uncomfortably beside McPhearson as they head for the door . 123 INT .

In the b.g. , a sea of monitors and the huge screens of computer-generated maps can be seen . As they walk along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the giant screens .

DEFCON 4 ? It represents our current alert status . . . our Defense Condition . It should read DEFCON 5 . . . That 's normal . But , we 're still on alert because you spoofed our system . If we had n't caught it in time . . . There 's a chance , admittedly remote . . . that we might have gone to DEFCON 1 , and that would mean a World War . David looks at him , genuinely impressed with the seriousness of his speech . &nbsp; MCPHEARSONNow , I can understand why you broke in the first time . You just wanted to play a game . &nbsp; DAVIDThat 's right . . . That 's what I 've been telling everyone .  --  71  --  &nbsp; MCPHEARSONBut , after the news broke and you realized how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; DAVIDI did n't do it again .
