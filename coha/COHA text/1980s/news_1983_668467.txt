A checkless society may be far in the future for the average consumer . But in the corporate world , some companies are preparing to go checkless in a few months . The move is significant because the new electronic corporate payments system eliminates float , the money a payor can use before a payment check clears . Although the corporate world has been delaying electronic payments for just that reason , recent developments have signaled that float is on its way out . Corporations are lurching ahead , preparing to give up checks , invoices and float for the increased efficiency the electronic system can offer . Corporate transactions account for only about 43 percent of total check volume . But because the dollar volume is significantly higher , a corporateshift to electronics will be a major boost toward a less- checked society . " If float is working for you , then you ' re reluctant to do it , " said Oren T. Pollock , assistant treasurer with Sears , Roebuck and Co. , one of the corporations participating in the new system . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ float , obviously it ' s dumb to continue with checks . " On June 1 , several major corporations and financial institutions will begin trading the billions of dollars that flow back and forth electronically through the nation ' s automated clearing system for the first time . So far Westinghouse Electric Corp. , Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. , Sears , Black &; Decker , International Telephone and Telegraph and one other corporation and the financial institutions they have chosen are participating in the pilot program developed by the National Automated Clearing House Association ( NACHA ) . Black &; Decker has chosen First National Bank of Maryland to process its payments . Chase Manhattan Bank , Mellon National Bank , Lincoln First Bank of Rochester and Chemical Bank are also among the banks participating in the system . Hoping to dig out from under the mountain of checks they must process , other banks are trying to sell the system to corporate customers . " It will be an evolutionary process , " said James Lordon , president of NACHA and senior vice president of Boston ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that within a year you ' ll see such a big success that there will be a tremendous impact on the volume of corporate checks . But within this decade , we will see electronics surpass check payment . " Bankers hoping to stay the growth in check volume predict there never will be a checkless society . Instead , as one banker said , " we ' ll see an evolution of a mix of paper and electronics . " The electronic payments system will automate and reduce to one step the trade payment process - from the mailing of checks and invoices , to the sorting and processing on the receiver ' s end , to the clearing of the checks . Using the new system , a payor can transfer thousands of pieces of information and many payments in one shot . For some corporations , the loss of float is the main point of discussion and stumbling block to joining the system . Although there is some debate as to how much money corporations stand to lose if float is eliminated , Westinghouse , for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will lose $2.5 million a year by scratching float off its books . To compensate for the loss , Westinghouse and other corporations in the program plan to renegotiate trade terms .
