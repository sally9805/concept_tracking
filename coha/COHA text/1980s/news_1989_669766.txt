Nick was our Christmas puppy , born on Halloween , bought in front of the toy store on Christmas Eve . He was a little furball , black as licorice , with sharp teeth , cuddling with his brothers and sisters in a basket under the soft snowfall . Who could resist ? His pedigree , said the man with the litter , was half Labrador , half golden retriever , but he soon outgrew both breeds . The Labrador retriever half was , evidently , Newfoundland retriever. // Nick had become a legendary uncle to our children . They ' ve seen his picture in his photo albums and loved hearing the stories of his antics . Every dog owner can tell the story of the Sunday roast left on the counter and ' ' removed ' ' by the dog . But once , we told the kids , Nick ate an entire chocolate cake left on the kitchen counter , the kind of cake one calls a gateau , a recipe from the New York Times named ' ' bete noir . ' ' Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just his kind of humor. // // He poached food from outside the family . The janitors at the school where I taught had their 10 a. m. doughnuts missing one day . I happened to see Nick skulking around their basement lounge licking his lips , sugar crullers on his breath , so I felt compelled to nip over to the bakery for replacements to bail him out. // Nick slept under our bed because he was afraid of thunder and lightning , we told Hilary , age 4 and cautious about dogs . He would climb into bed with us the next morning , dust bunnies clinging to his ' ' Newfie ' ' fur . ' ' Nick can get into my bed , ' ' Hilary said when we told her that Nick was coming to visit . Soon she was even conversant with all of our nicknames for Nick : Nicky , Nickle , Biggie , Boogins , The Biggest One , Gooster , Dufus. // Days before Nick arrived Hilary started counting the minutes and explaining to neighbors just who the big black dog was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ) , and how big he was ( ' He ' s big , but you don ' t have to be afraid of him because he ' s gentle , ' ' Hilary kept explaining , talking herself into composure ) , and explaining to us just how she would walk him , feed him , pat him , comb him , sleep with him. // When Nick finally walked into to the yard with Sue , Hilary scrambled right up to my top branches , her standard reaction to even the smallest dog standing on the sidewalk a block away . While she was clamped on to me , we watched Nick survey the backyard . Spencer , age six , immediately stalked him , rope in hand , eager to tour the park with ' ' his dog ' ' in tow. // Hilary jumped down to the ground rather soon when she saw Ariel , her one-year-old sister , careen over and say her word in the dog ' s face : ' ' Wow ! ' ' By evening Hilary was brushing Biggie and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hilary had her way , we would have seen poor Nick in the bathtub getting a shampoo and blow dry . Within three days she was walking him to the park on the leash bossing me out of the way - ' ' Dad , you ' re always crowding me . ' ' Nick knows the way no matter who is driving. // It took Nick little time to find an old football to fetch and maul , a favorite hall corner in which to nest , the special spot underneath the highchair where the scraps fall . He shows Ariel what fun it is to feed a doggie ; she understands the relationship and slips him the peas . He even follows her around with an eye on her milk bottle . She plies him with apple juice ; this is not his cup of tea // One evening during his visit neighborhood boys were exploding bottle rockets and Nick retreated beneath our bed for safety . Another night , during a particularly powerful thunderstorm , Nick sought us out for reassurance at 2 a. m . Spencer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booms , gathered around Nick on our bed and explained that ' ' it was all right , just thunder . ' ' What a scene : two parents , two kids , and the **32;50511;TOOLONG on the queen-size bed. // When we all pile into the minivan , Nick rides in the back with the flotilla of carseats . He herds the flocks of kids on the playground. // Nick was , for Spencer , a real animal for his lassos and rope traps ; a kind of older brother . For a while , I was to be relieved of having to put my wrists and ankles into slip knots and led around the yard or jailed . Nick also fetches better than I do. // Naturally his presence is poignant for Lesley and me . We hadn ' t seen Nick during the intervening years and , though we expected him not to remember us , it was still a bit odd to think he couldn ' t reminisce about his former days as our dog ! Nick was like a visitor from our marriage before children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intervening years : the move to a new job , our first house , a baby boy , a baby girl , the move to a larger house , a big yard ( ' ' maybe we ' ll have a dog again someday ' ' ) , and another baby girl . He is a time traveler from a galaxy that seems far , far away. // A few days before Nick was supposed to leave our house and return to Sue , I asked Hilary whether she was ready to own a dog . Had she liked having Nick around ? ' ' Let ' s get a dog . The day after tomorrow , ' ' we said . Then Sue called . She had been thinking about something . Would we consider taking Nick back ? She always thought of herself as a caretaker and it seemed to her quite natural to think of him returning to live with Spencer , Hilary , and Ariel. // We thought it over . It didn ' t take long to decide . We broached it with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Nickie stayed with us and became our dog ? ' ' No answer was required , really . With a very Dickensian twist , Nick is our once and future dog. // I drive the kids to school in the morning since they attend the school where I teach . Nick hates being left behind and some days when he trots out to the car with us we just pop him in the back and bring him along . He gets to run on the soccer field in the morning , gobble up crackers and milk at snack time , and play outfield for the stick-ball game at recess . Of course you have to have two balls handy when a compulsive retriever is playing outfield or there will be nothing to pitch. // Hilary proudly and authoritatively walks him to the door of her classroom . He doesn ' t cross the threshold lest Chocolate the guinea pig have a conniption . During his first week as a first grader Spencer wrote about Nick in his journal . The title , of course : ' ' My Dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my office , Nick ate my assistant ' s breakfast . I guess I ' ll bail him out again. // //
