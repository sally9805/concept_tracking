Standing in the on-deck circle , Darryl Strawberry looked at the man on the mound , Cincinnati righthander Mario Soto , and then started for the batter 's box . " I was a little excited , " Strawberry would say . And with reason . It was April 2 , a sunny Opening Day in Riverfront Stadium , the start of a new baseball season and the first at bat of the year for the Mets ' 22-year-old rightfielder . In fact , Strawberry had been waiting all winter for this moment , knowing that the Mets would be opening in Cincinnati and figuring that Soto , the star of the staff , would be the opposing pitcher . Now there was Soto , sure enough , with that hopping fastball and the nastiest change-up in the National League . Walking to the plate that day , Strawberry thought : This is it . This is the challenge all over again , me and Mario Soto. // Strawberry did n't particularly cherish the memory . The only other time he had faced Soto was in Shea Stadium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the Mets called him up from Tidewater . Soto fanned him three straight times , then popped him up , keeping him off-balance and tentative with an array of heat and changeups that bedazzled the young rookie and left him muttering to himself in the clubhouse . " I remember thinking after that game , ' Whew ! I never saw that kind of stuff in the minor leagues , ' " Strawberry recalls . // That performance , not incidentally , launched the rookie on an excruciating slump that lasted weeks and that found him , on June 5 , batting .161 . The Met front office wondered whether he should be dispatched back to the Class AAA Tides . Strawberry eventually got on track , of course , hitting .313  --  with 14 home runs and 34 RBIs  --  over the last 54 games of the season . Indeed , despite the depressing start , he ended up hitting .257 , with 26 dingers and 74 RBIs , and was voted the National League Rookie of the Year . // But that was then and this was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I can hit anybody . " Anybody in this case was Mario Soto. // On the first pitch Soto offered a changeup down and inside , and Strawberry swung mightily but missed . " I was too excited , " he says . So he stepped out of the box and told himself : Just relax . Be patient . Wait for your pitch . Soto 's second pitch was a carbon copy of the first , and Strawberry kept the bat on his shoulder . Ball . On the third pitch , he took Mario Soto downtown . // It was another change inside , only slightly higher , and Strawberry crushed it . Uncoiling his 6 ' 6 " , 195-pound body , his unusually quick hands whipping the 32-ounce bat into the pitch , he drove it in a long arc into the second deck in right-field , the ball caroming about the seats some 450 feet away . He felt a rush . " It felt good getting ahold of it , " Strawberry says . " As I rounded the bases , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bat for me . I had something to prove , and it tickled me. " // For Darryl Strawberry , acting out a seemingly fanciful script that was even better in reality , the 1984 baseball season had begun . By Sunday he had hit three home runs in nine games , helping the Mets to a division-leading 6-3 record , and was batting .294 , with three runs batted in . He has just turned 22 but already there are signs that he might fulfill the promise seen by Brooks Hurst , his baseball coach at Crenshaw High in Los Angeles . " You could be a black Ted Williams , " Hurst had told him . To which Straw replied , " Who 's Ted Williams ? " // " Ted Williams is an awful large order , " says former Met manager George Bamberger , " but if someone asked me , ' Who coming up will be another Ted Williams ? ' , well , I 'd have to say Darryl Strawberry . I 've compared ballplayers to other ballplayers but never to Ted Williams . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one of the greatest ever to play the game . " // " If he continues to try to improve and he takes the game seriously , both offensively and defensively and as a base runner , within three years Darryl Strawberry can probably be as valuable a ballplayer as anybody in the game , " says Chicago Cubs manager Jim Frey , who , as the Mets ' batting coach in ' 83 , was Strawberry 's guru . " The whole question is his continued motivation and ambition and willingness to work . " // " If we miss on this young man , we all better look for a career change , " says Frank Howard , Strawberry 's manager last year after Bamberger resigned on June 3 . " He can go as far in baseball as any man living . " // Strawberry sighs and rolls his eyes . He has heard it all  --  the Ted Williams talk and the sky's-the-limit stuff  --  and he wants it to go away . " I do n't believe that , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that crap . That 's what I call it : crap . I just want to be myself . I just want to be me . To have fun and play baseball . " // Strawberry has been playing ball since he was growing up in the parks and playgrounds of the black ghettos of south Los Angeles , the third of five kids raised in a three-bedroom stucco ranch by his mother , Ruby . Today she is an engagingly bright , charming and youthful woman of 43 , who works as a circuit designer for the phone company . The Strawberry children  --  Michael , 24 , Ronnie , 23 , Darryl , Regina , 21 , and Michelle , 19  --  never went hungry , but it was n't an easy childhood . Their father , Henry , a postal worker and frequenter of racetracks , moved out when Darryl was 13 . Ruby objected to his gambling their money away and finally filed for divorce . // " I could n't live like that , " she says . " We had the house to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything that goes along with it . He played the horses . He was n't responsible . " // " If you do n't take gambling , you do n't take me , " Henry says now . " It 's a part of my life .... I loved her , but she says that I did n't show it . I hated to leave . " // Darryl felt the split more deeply than the other four children , and today he still is angry at his father , though his mother says , " Be forgiving . " Darryl is trying . " I 'm getting better about it , " he says . " It 's kind of out of my mind now . It was very tough to handle , being young . " His father 's leaving home was , to be sure , the central trauma of his youth , and he 's still searching for a guiding male hand to lead him . That he has repeatedly found it , from Little League to high school to minor and major league ball , makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " // First there was John Moseley , a 66-year-old retired truck driver who 's an assistant baseball coach at Compton College and a neighbor of the Strawberrys . In his spare time Moseley gave baseball tips to Michael and Ronnie Strawberry . " When I talked to Mike and Ronnie , Darryl listened and absorbed , " Moseley says . " Darryl was never a guy to mess around with girls . Baseball is all Darryl talked about . He was a baseball fanatic . " // Moseley took the boys to the park every day , drilling them in fundamentals , and treating them as if they were his own kids . " He 'd hit a hundred fly balls a day to each of us , " says Ronnie . " Then we 'd sit at his house and talk about ball  --  ' Anybody can pull the ball , ' he 'd say . ' Can you go the other way with it ? Or up the middle ? '  --  and he 'd take us to the Jack-in-the-Box to eat . " And he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting in the streets . " Your hands are too important to be punching a guy around , " Moseley would tell them . " How you gon na play ball with a broken hand ? " // " Mister Moseley taught me everything I know about the game , " Strawberry says . " I heard it first from him . " // In sandlot ball Darryl was renowned for his towering home runs . " When my brother gets to high school , you 're going to see something , " Michael , already a star centerfielder , told Hurst . When Darryl finally got to Crenshaw , Hurst found he was a moody , troubled youth , still bitter about his father 's leaving home . " I think that had a lot to do with it , " Straw says . " We had to go through a lot of rough times . I carried a bad attitude around with me . I believed I did n't have to listen to anyone , did n't have to do anything . " // One day , coming in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then walked the rest . Hurst tapped the " C " on Darryl 's Crenshaw baseball cap and said , " You want to wear this C , you 've got to hustle . " Darryl turned to him and snapped , " Nobody touches me ! " Then he took off his uniform shirt , handed it to Hurst and quit the team . " I just ca n't play anymore , " he said . Strawberry later appealed to Hurst for reinstatement , but the coach refused to take him back , in the belief that this might straighten out his head . It did , at least for a time . " It was the best thing that happened to me , " Strawberry says . // In his junior and senior years , Darryl became the Straw that stirred Crenshaw 's drink , a selfless player on both the basketball and baseball teams , and what struck both Hurst and assistant basketball coach Joe Weakley were qualities that Moseley had seen years before : an inordinate sense of pride  --  a real distaste for losing  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He hated to look bad ; he hated to lose , " says Hurst . // Playing rightfield and pitching occasionally , Strawberry hit .400 his senior year , with five home runs and 18 RBIs ; he was the high school sensation of the country . He had it all : power , speed and an arm to boot . In June 1980 the Mets made him the No. 1 choice in the free-agent draft . Brother Michael joined the Dodgers ' farm system that same year , but by now it was Darryl , heading for Kings-port , Tenn. , in the Rookie League , who was the Strawberry picked to make it . // " That little town of Kingsport had a press conference , " says Chuck Hiller , the team 's manager at the time . " I never saw that in the Rookie League before . I just broke him in slow , a big old gangly guy , like he is now . " And more lonesome than he thought it possible to be . Ruby had woven a tight family ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " We 're just like brothers and sisters " ) and it was the first time Darryl was away from home . He called every day , collect , his voice mournful and subdued . " He was so pitiful , " Ruby says . " He was just lost . I 'd get the phone bill and almost faint . I told him , ' The money you got is going to be gone if you keep calling . ' " // Strawberry had arrived in Kingsport about a month late , after successfully holding out for a signing bonus of $200,000 , and what Hiller recalls most vividly is Darryl hovering outside his office door , standing there before and after games , wanting to talk about anything . " Well , come on in , " Hiller would say . The whole season was painful . " It was very lonely , " Strawberry says . " Gee , they were very kind people , but I did n't think I 'd ever get out of there . " When he finally did , hitting .268 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were murmurings among Met officials that perhaps they had made a mistake in drafting him . // So , too , in 1981 , when he went to Lynchburg , Va . and again struggled during the first part of the season . But then he got himself together and wound up hitting 13 homers and knocking in 78 runs . " His work habits on the field were n't real good the first third of the season , " says his Lynchburg manager , Gene Dusan . " Then he started pushing himself and concentrating . " At one point , Strawberry thought of checking out and going home . " I was confused , " he said . // " There was a lot of pressure on him , and he did n't know how to handle it , " says catcher Lloyd McClendon , his roommate and confidant in Lynchburg for a spell . " He went into a shell and tried to deal with his problems on his own . He was troubled . There were times when he talked about going home . I told him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . ' He was young , he did n't have good work habits . In this game , it 's easy to stay in bed all day , especially on the road . What Darryl did n't understand is that you have to get your body regulated . You 've got to get up early , walk around and do things  --  go to the mall , take in a movie . It 's very easy to lie around and grab a bite and go play . But you 're not getting yourself ready either physically or mentally to play the game . " // Whatever it was that hounded him in Kingsport and Lynchburg and raised doubts about his future in the game , vanished in 1982 . Playing for the Jackson ( Miss . ) Mets , he tore up the Texas League , hitting 34 home runs with 97 RBIs and becoming the league 's Most Valuable Player . " In Jackson , he just put it all together , " says Dusan , his manager there , too . There were days Strawberry astonished his coaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball that cost a run , he came to the plate with two men on to a standing chorus of hoots and jeers . " With one swing of the bat , he silenced that crowd like I 'd never heard a crowd silenced in my life , " says Bobby Valentine , Jackson 's first-base coach at the time . " The ball went so high and so far , I was in awe . " // Strawberry went to spring training with the Mets in 1983 and played extremely well  --  but the team cautiously decided to send him back to Tidewater . However , when the parent club floundered , he was called up with predictable hype and hoopla . It 's no wonder , then , that Soto fanned him three times , that he froze and grew tentative at the plate , and that the savior of the franchise collapsed so totally into that slump that he seemed about to disappear altogether . // " It was the most difficult time of my life , " Strawberry says . " I was nervous , scared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those big parks in front of all those people . And you hear your name announced . It kind of gives you the jitters . That 's what it did to me , especially when I tried to pressure myself to do well , to try to hit home runs , to show people what I could do . I got off wrong , thinking that way . I was n't staying within myself . I was overswinging , uppercutting , giving the pitchers too much credit . I came in cold , trying to save the ball club . I was trying to do things I could n't do . I had to find myself again , to really believe in what I could do at this level of ball . " // In the midst of these agonies , during a three-day road trip to Montreal in mid-June , Howard and Frey decided to bench Strawberry in hopes of getting him to relax and regroove . And also to make him work harder . " They felt I was n't putting out enough , and they were right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I was n't aware of it . It was n't attitude . I was struggling , confused . I was thinking of so many things : girl friend , family , being in the big leagues , going from city to city , new pitchers . I was suddenly in the majors with all these guys I 'd been watching for years . Wow ! I did n't know where I fit in . It hit me all at one time . " // Strawberry had always had pillars to lean on  --  Moseley when he was a young boy , Dusan when he was a young man  --  and he suddenly had another in Frey . Says Strawberry , " I did n't know which way to turn , who to turn to , and Frey steps in like a father and says , ' I 'm going to help you , but you got to help yourself , too . ' I 'm still green , but then I was really green . Frey 's a great guy . He really helped me. " // The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and afternoons before games . They sometimes spent 40 minutes before a game just walking together . Some passages from the gospel according to Frey : // " A lot of good things are going to happen over the next 15 years if you put in the work .... Study pitchers and get a feel for what each one is trying to do . Baseball can be so much fun if you think of playing in the majors as a gift . Fans and writers are dying to appreciate you and respect you if you just give them a chance .... Work on your defense .... A big salary is a player 's reward for what he has already done . Most of the players you hold in awe are n't the players they once were .... Think , ' I 'm the best player on the field tonight , ' and you will be . Lock that in your head and nobody can take it away . " // Only once during that first week did Strawberry fail to show up early . Frey upbraided him : " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going to call you and I 'm not going to beg you to do what you should be doing . " // Over the next 10 weeks , Strawberry never again missed a session with Frey , and gradually he came out of the slump . He grew more aggressive at the plate , and he shed his reluctance to hit balls to the opposite field . " I started turning things around , " he says , " and all of a sudden I was back to myself . " // Strawberry began 1984 , his first full year in the big leagues , after an outstanding spring training in which he worked to level off his stroke , cut down on strikeouts  --  he fanned 128 times in 420 at bats last season  --  and hit to the opposite field . With Frey gone , Strawberry 's guru now is the well-traveled Bill Robinson , the new Met batting coach , who preaches from his own text : " The money lies in the RBIs . You do n't have to hit a home run to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle . Wait longer on the pitch . If a man can drive a ball to the opposite field like you can , does n't it behoove you to use two-thirds of the field instead of just one-third ? " // During the winter in L.A. , Strawberry practiced batting in a park near his mother 's home , where he was living . He 's not a partygoer or a carouser . " I wanted to stay close to the family , " he says . " I wanted to share my moments with them . " He broke up with his fianc ? e , USC basketball star Paula McGee , last fall , but this winter he found another in Lisa Andrews , a former model who is now a loan coordinator in a Pasadena bank . They plan to marry in January . // " I 'm going to take care of my whole family , " Strawberry says . " I 'm battling for all of them . " Except for Henry Strawberry , of course , who has remarried and deeply feels the estrangement from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his success , " he says . " Sometimes I feel down about it , but what can I do ? As long as he 's happy , I 'm happy . " // At the moment , Straw is . He took some mild heat for statements he made this spring that he planned to take over as team leader , but he does n't care . The Mets have needed a leader for years . " Leadership is going to be another challenge to me , " he says . " I 'm tired of getting ripped about how terrible the ball club is . How can this club get out of the cellar if it does n't have any leadership ? " // The question answers itself . For Strawberry , leadership began the only way it can begin , on the third pitch of the new season , when he took Mario Soto downtown .
