Music lovers tend to take their taste in the classics for granted . But it is worthwhile to have the mind invigorated by listening to old works in a fresh way . Some recent releases that issue a challenge : <P> MENDELSSOHN : Five Symphonies ; Three Overtures . Claudio Abbado conducting the London Symphony Orchestra ( Deutsche Grammophon ; 4 LPs or CDs ) . Imagine the history of 19th century music if Felix Mendelssohn had been the great romantic icon instead of Beethoven . In place of egocentric storms there would be grace and lucidity ; instead of anguish there would be serenity and inner peace . The masterpieces produced by such disparate composers as Brahms , Wagner and Mahler % under Beethoven 's spell are justly prized , of course , but the romantics could have used a little less irascibility and more agreeability . <P> This is not to say that Mendelssohn 's music is merely happy talk . One of the greatest prodigies in musical history , young Felix wrote 13 symphonies for string orchestra before the age of 15 and produced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quicksilver Overture to A Midsummer Night 's Dream , the most successful purely instrumental interpretation of Shakespeare ever written . Yet Mendelssohn had the emotional range to evoke the craggy , forbidding atmosphere of the Hebrides in his " Fingal 's Cave " Overture , summon up the combative spirit of the Scottish highlands in his Third Symphony and capture the religious fervor of Lutheranism in the " Reformation " Symphony . His was a winning , unaffected , protean talent that , like Mozart 's or Schubert 's , was snuffed out too early by his death at age 38 . <P> Abbado and the London Symphony more than do justice to this underrated composer ( Mendelssohn 's reputation has still to recover fully from the damage the Nazis did to it ) , offering crisp , incisive performances . The " Italian " Symphony explodes in a burst of melody , its irresistible opening theme a shout of joy , its finale a whirling saltarello . But Abbado is just as persuasive in the Symphony No. 2 , a religious choral work subtitled Hymn of Praise . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its emotional antithesis : calm where Beethoven is uneasy , confident where Beethoven is questioning , sacred where Beethoven is secular . Mendelssohn 's is the other face of romanticism , and this set argues his case eloquently . <P> LISZT : Sonata in B Minor ; Two Legends ; The Blessing of God in Solitude . Francois-Rene Duchable , piano ( Erato ; LP or CD ) . Franz Liszt , the archetypal piano virtuoso , wrote only one sonata for his instrument , but what a sonata it is ! Bril liant , bombastic , tender , devilishly diffi cult , structurally innovative , the nearly half-hour work is the summa of romantic piano technique , and every modern pianist must test his mettle with it to claim Liszt 's mantle . Most opt for a straightforward , flashy approach , hoping to conquer the piece by sheer dexterity . Duchable , a young Frenchman with an especially rich tone , adopts a more reflective attitude , which gives the sonata dramatic coherence . He treats the work as a full-scale tone poem rather than a prolonged etude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come , he suggests , so why rush them ? The shorter pieces get similarly thoughtful , impressive readings .
