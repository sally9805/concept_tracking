THE SHINING Directed by Stanley Kubrick Screenplay by Stanley Kubrick and Diane Johnson <P> If one is determined to find a super natural explanation for the strange goings-on in the old , grand , snowbound hotel in the Rockies , it is just barely possible to do so . But Stanley Kubrick really does not care . His adaptation of The Shining , Stephen King 's pulpy haunted-house novel , keeps forcing reasonable - or non-occult - interpretations on the behavior , variously bonkers and bloody , that his camera records with its customary elegance . Whether his stylistic mastery and rigorous intelligence will carry this film to commercial success with the bedrock audience for horror - a young crowd that likes its metaphysics murky and its menaces crude - is problematical . But it is impossible not to admire Kubrick for flouting conventional expectations of his horror film just as he did those of the sci-fi tale in 2001 . <P> The situation is classic . Reasons for juxtaposing the ordinary with the ominous must be found . A scheme for keeping the two sequestered until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The everyday element is represented by the Torrance family . Dad ( Jack Nicholson ) is a writer who claims that he is looking for a quiet place to work ; Mom ( Shelley Duvall ) has no apparent interests other than her family 's welfare . Their son ( Danny Lloyd ) has an angelic face and a sweet spirit . The dreadful is ostensibly represented by the hotel they are hired to watch over when it is closed for the winter . Its vastness is emphasized by its emptiness . It does not so much shelter the family group as threaten to swallow them up , especially after snow cuts them off from the world . The place has the requisite haunted history . Years ago , another caretaker murdered his wife and daughters and then killed himself there . <P> From the start Kubrick hints at reversals to come . There is something false in Nicholson 's bonhomie as he applies for the job . Shortly thereafter a history of drifting and alcoholism is casually alluded to . This man may not be the usual horror-story victim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if he might not turn out to be the source of the story 's evil instead of its plaything . Then , too , his son 's gifts for precognition and telepathy , also quickly established , do not seem to be evidence of demonic possession of the sort that The Exorcist and The Omen have conditioned audiences to expect from pretty children who act strangely . <P> Rather , one comes to realize that these are defense mechanisms developed by a mind desperately reaching for weapons against the father 's erratic behavior . <P> Once the Torrances are settled in , Kubrick refuses to characterize the hotel as a conventionally haunted house . Its corridors are brightly lit , nothing goes bump in the night . Even the strange visions , when they begin to appear , are not necessarily to be seen as spooky apparitions , but as the hallucinations of a mind - Nicholson 's - allowing itself to be drawn toward the violent conclusion the child has foreseen .                  @ @ @
