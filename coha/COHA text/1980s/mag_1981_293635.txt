TRUE CONFESSIONS Directed by Ulu Grosbard Screenplay by Joan Didion and John Gregory Dunne <P> A grand novel , was John Gregory Dunne 's True Confessions . Taking as his real-life hook the grisly ( and unsolved ) Black Dahlia murder case , in which a young woman of no particular virtue was found here and there in a vacant Los Angeles lot in 1947 , Dunne created characters who jumped , kicked and back-stabbed off the page . The Spellacy brothers-Detective Tom and Monsignor Des-played each other like a couple of harps and took down half the town 's power elite when they played each other wrong . Dunne 's was a misanthropic story that moved with reckless energy . <P> So why does the movie version , with Robert Duvall as Tom and Robert De Niro as Des , proceed at the sluggish pace of a Sodality novena ? Perhaps because Dunne 's collaborator on the screenplay was his wife , the Empress of Angst , Novelist Joan Didion . Onscreen , characters who should percolate with rage simply simmer . Two exciting , dangerous actors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pacing and waiting ; De Niro 's big scene has him hanging up his vestments . <P> As a pair of crafty old hierarchs , Cyril Cusack and Burgess Meredith seem to be having some informed fun , but most of the characters disappear from memory as soon as they leave the screen . It 's a shame : <P> this could have been a bitterly raucous movie , if only the artists involved had n't confused seriousness with solemnity . For their penance , they should see any Bunuel movie ten times . - By Richard Corliss
