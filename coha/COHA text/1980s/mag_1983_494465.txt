By EVERY ordinary measure of political performance , Walter Mondale has trounced John Glenn in the 1983 phase of the 1984 Democratic Presidential campaign . As of September 30 , Mondale had raised $6.1 million to Glenn 's 54.1 million , and by the end of the year Mondale will have raised more than $9 million to Glenn 's 56 million or $7 million . Glenn surged close to Mondale in most public opinion polls in May and June , but by November Mondale was comfortably out front again ? by 21 points in the Harris poll , 28 points in The Washington Post-ABC poll , 19 points in the Gal ? lup poll , and even 13 points in the Penn-Schoen poll , regarded by Glenn campaign officials as the most reliable of the lot . As The New York Times report ? ed on November 28 , Mon-dale had 175 campaign workers at work in twenty-one states ; Glenn had 122 paid organizers in fifteen states . No one has kept ac ? curate count of major en ? dorsements by political fig ? ures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ahead among mayors , members of Congress , governors , party professionals and interest groups , topped off by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. and the National Education Association . The foremost arena of public competition in 1983 was state party straw polls , and here , too , Mondale bested Glenn consistently . In most places , Glenn finished behind both Mondale and Senator Alan Cranston of California . The crucial question , of course , is whether 1983 results mean much for 1984 . Clearly they do not mean every ? thing , as history shows . The landscape is so littered with the names of front-runners who failed and longshots who triumphed ? Rockefeller and Goldwater in 1963 , Muskie and McGovern in 1971 , Jackson ( or Bayh or Udall ) and Jimmy Carter in 1975 , Edward Kennedy and Carter in 1979 ? that betting on the conventional wisdom of anymoment seems a recipe for disaster . It is remotely possible that Cranston , Gary Hart , or Ernest Hollings could rush to the fore , Carter-style . But in most polls only Jesse Jackson has even broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inating system is specifically stacked to prevent surprises . For once , conventional wisdom seems correct . This is a two-man race and Mondale is ahead . The Glenn campaign certainly does not think that Mon dale 's lead is insurmount ? able . In fact , some of Glenn 's strategists sound as if they had planned a Dallas Cowboys-style fourth-quarter come-from ? behind strategy all along . " 1983 was the exhibition season , " said manager Bill White . " 1984 is the real season . " White is right but only partially . Mondale 's 1983 victories did n't win him any delegates but they will pay dividends in 1984 . The amount of money the can didates raise in 1983 in contributions of under $250 determines how much matching money they will get from the fed eral government in Janu ary 1984 . Mondale manag ers figure that their 1983 lead of $3 million may swell to as much as 56 million just as the time arrives to buy advertis ing and pay workers for the twenty-seven-state blitz of caucuses and primaries that commences in Iowa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegates to the Democratic convention by the end of March . Both cam paigns acknowledge they will not have money to run all out everywhere , but a money advantage will enable Mon dale to run harder in more places . His managers say their 1983 fundraising also has enabled them to assemble a big ger list of small contributors who can be solicited again for matchable money as the campaign proceeds . On December 10 alone , the Mondale campaign hopes to at tract seventy thousand people to seven thousand house parties across the country and raise $750,000 , all of it feder ? ally matchable . To be sure , endorsements are n't what they used to be , but they are n't insignificant either , as Mondale is likely to show on January 18 , when the House Democratic cau ? cus selects its 164 delegates to the national convention in the first real test of strength for 1984 . Both Glenn and Mondale have put top talent to work on the contest ? Glenn 's headed by his principal managers , Washington lobbyists Robert Keefe and Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma ; and Mondale 's by his former Vice Presidential chief of staff , Richard Moe , and Representatives Gillis Long of Louisiana , Tom Downey of New York , Les AuCoin of Oregon , and Marty Russo of Illinois . Mondale seems certain to win a majority of the House delegates , possibly by as much as a two-to ? one margin . Similarly the endorsement of Mondale by the Cook County Democratic organization in Illinois ? a conserva ? tive group that might have been wooed successfully by Glenn ? will help in the March 20 primary , where dele ? gates ' names are on the ballot , and help attract voters to the Presidential candidate . Endorsements from black leaders ? including Coretta Scott King and Mayors Cole ? man Young of Detroit and Tom Bradley of Los Angeles ? will help limit the damage caused by Jesse Jackson in the South . And the A.F , L.-C.1.0. and N.E.A. endorsements will mean up to $20 million worth of workers , transporta ? tion , publicity , and voter-turnout activities for Mondale . IT 'S TRUE that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they had two useful functions for Mondale besides their immediate publicity value and the longer-term sense of momentum they created . First , they were encouraged by Mondale 's managers as a means of " na ? tionalizing " the campaign and preventing Gary Hart and Alan Cranston from spending all their time and energy in Iowa and New Hampshire and staging a surprise victory . Second , when Mondale unexpectedly lost to Cranston in the Wisconsin straw poll on June 10 , his managers decided to go all-out to win the Maine poll on October 1 , and used it as an opportunity to train several dozen young organiz ? ers who are now staffing Mondale campaign offices all over the country . Mondale won the Maine poll with 51 percent to Cranston 's 29 percent ( Glenn , who declined to compete , got 6 percent ) , but almost as importantly , he got his staff prepared for 1984 campaigns in caucus states , where essentially the same skills are required as in a straw poll . Only 5 percent or so of a state 's Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caucus state , as op ? posed to 40 percent in a primary election , so the advantage goes to the campaign with the greater organizational depth ? precinct coverage , the ability to contact and iden ? tify supporters , and to turn them out on caucus night . The organizational advantage is diminished in a primary , where television plays a bigger role . Even Glenn 's top aides admit that Mondale has an edge in the caucus states , including Iowa . What has n't been recognized is that in the early weeks of the campaign caucus states ( among them Maine , Oklahoma , Washington , Mississippi , South Caro ? lina , Michigan , and Kentucky ) outnumber primaries two ? to-one , and give Mondale another advantage . All of this , as one Glenn campaign chief acknowledged , " did not come about by accident . " If ever a Presidential campaign was carefully planned in advance , it is the Mon-dale effort of 1984 . In fact , Mondale first sat down with his top Vice Presidential advisers , Moe , Jim Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1980 election to begin preparing for 1984 . By the time Ronald Reagan was inaugurated , Mondale had a law firm to hang his hat in , a string of visiting professorships to keep up a Minnesota connection with , a political action committee formed , and an early schedule assembled . Johnson , at age 36 , a veteran of four previous Presidential campaigns and Mondale 's traveling companion during the Vice Presidency , was put in charge of Presidential planning . Johnson , a tall , quiet , methodical man with a clean desk and a phenomenal memory , put together Mondale 's first comprehensive 1984 strategy document in February of 1981 . Glenn 's chief campaign aide , Bill White , an Ohioan who had no previous national political experience , did not draft a full-blown strategy memo until November 1982 . Part of Mondale 's 1982 strategy against Glenn , accord ? ing to Johnson , was to accelerate the campaign . " We want ? ed to do everything possible to generate interest in the 1984 race and put requirements on people to be acting fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn into the political frame . We felt if he was sitting out above it all , he was an unknown quantity . So we put pressure on him to politicize , to start making his decisions , choosing his staff , forming a PAC , announce his candidacy . There must have been five hundred stories written saying that ' Glenn 's behind the curve . ' " The 1982 strategy also called for Mon-dale to keep maximum pressure on President Reagan , to use Reagan policies to unify Democrats , to " focus on the future , " and to develop position papers that would force other candidates to react to the Mondale agenda . GLENN 'S PEOPLE announce almost proudly that whereas Mondale had a campaign structure that was " fourteen stories tall " by mid-1982 , " we had done nothing " until August , when Glenn approved plans for a Presidential advisory committee . White 's strategy memo of November 24 , 1982 , " has basically guided the campaign from that moment to this , " its author said . Though it did not contemplate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more potent contender than Gary Hart . " In terms of general themes and messages , there have n't been any major deviations , " White said . " In 1983 , Mondale did what he had to do and we did what we had to do . " White grants that Mondale 's successes are more appar ? ent now than Glenn 's . " Mondale and Glenn are looking at the same voters , the same base of support , " he said , " but they are going after it in different ways . Mondale is going after leadership in hopes that leadership can get him the voters . Glenn is appealing to the membership and if he gets it , leadership will come around and not stand in his way . We are after the unorganized constituencies . Mon-dale is after the organized ones . " According to White , " We are trying to pace our expendi ? tures . We are not organizing for effect . It does n't take fourteen months to organize Iowa . You get more bang for the buck when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why we did n't compete in the straw polls . We are doing exactly what we wanted to do all along . " Frankly , that sounds a lot more like putting a pleasant face on grim reality than smart planning . In fact , Glenn did compete in early straw polls and even sought and scored a victory in New Jersey where Mondale was not present . Glenn never rejected endorsements from unions or teacher groups in his Ohio campaigns , and made some effort to challenge Mondale this year , arguing that he was more electable than Mondale against Reagan . Organizationally , Glenn started late , but he did hire Joe Grandmaison , a skilled field operative , to set up offices in the states . But after a series of inspections of the organization this fall , including one by a Detroit manage ? ment consultant , Jeff Hochman , Grandmaison was re ? placed by Robert Keefe , one of whose jobs will be to bring more political heavyweights into the campaign . Keefe has begun by assigning Jerry Vento , who helped organize Iowa for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boston political consultant Paul Shone to run New Hampshire . /ACCORDING TO Mondale 's campaign chief , Jim John son , Glenn has operated backward . " Early on , when he needed a Bob Keefe to win over political regulars , they had Joe Grandmaison , the detail man , in charge . Now , just when they need somebody who knows how to run a phone bank and get volunteers to hand out ten thousand leaflets , they have Keefe . " Johnson thinks that substan ? tively , too , Glenn is doing things backward . " Had there been a conservative candidacy in 1983 , I believe there are an awful lot of places in both the South and the North where important people might have been with Glenn , but they were nowhere ideologically , emphasizing elect-ability , and we went out and got the Cook County organi ? zation , Bert Lance in Georgia , and other moderate-to ? conservative Democrats . Now we are going into the cau ? cuses , which are primarily populated by activists and lib ? erals , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the right . " The latest strategy of the Glenn campaign seems to be " attack Mondale , " but the Glenn organization calls it " dif ? ferentiation " ? an effort to identify Glenn in people 's minds by showing how he is different from Mondale . Despite a generally favorably aura about Glenn , his poll ? ster William Hamilton has found that voters lack a clear idea of what Glenn stands for . At the same time , Demo ? cratic voters tend to be less liberal on issues than Mondale has been , especially during his days as a Senator . So the Glenn strategy has been to paint Mondale as the servant of special interests , as someone who supported one set of policies as Vice President and another set as a candidate , as an opponent of adequate defense spending , and as a big spender on behalf of government programs . Mondale has been hitting back in ways designed to magnify the ideological difference between the candidates , accusing Glenn of writing " blank checks " to the Pentagon and advocating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both campaigns accuse the other of failing to enunciate a galvanizing message to the electorate , and here both sides are exactly right . Both Glenn and Mondale are try ? ing to make " the future " somehow the main theme of the campaign , but neither of them has been able so far to get past spending money ? or not spending money ? as a way of bringing the future to pass . Neither has articu ? lated anything like a foreign policy that will inspire allies and daunt adversaries ; Mondale 's foreign policy seems more uncertain than flexible , and Glenn 's more brittle than firm . THERE REMAINS a theoretical possibility that Glenn could break through this miasma and electrify the electorate , making it suddenly clear why he is more capable of leading the nation than Mondale is . There is also a possibility that the current Glenn message and strategy are working , but that observers like me are too caught up in conventional wisdom to see it . That said , however , what appears to be shaping up is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa poll in October showed Mondale ahead by 46 to 27 and a private poll for Alan Cranston shows Mondale leading 45 to 26 . Glenn 's chances in Iowa depend upon his expanding the electorate from the usual 100,000 caucus participants to 150,000 or 170,000 , but this requires a galvanizing media message plus organization , and Mondale will have his own media plus an organization that has been mobilized in all the state 's 3,000 precincts for months . The race is a good deal closer in New Hampshire , where one candi ? date or another is likely to slip into first place with 20-odd percent of the vote . Glenn 's people concede that their man has to win someplace on March 13 , presumably in Georgia , Alabama , and/or Florida , though Gallup and the Atlanta-based Darden poll show Mondale now ahead even in much of the South . Gallup also has Mondale leading in Illinois , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , Michigan , Texas and California , though Glenn aides com ? plain that the samples were too small , the results were unreliable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not counted . Still , if the seeds of a Glenn victory are germinating , some sign of it ought to be evident . At the moment , none is . Magic reversals are certainly possible in politics , but fundamentals ? money , organization , planning , experi ? ence , and support ? usually carry the day . Mondale won the 1983 campaign on fundamentals , and he 's far ahead for 1984.
