When Donald J. Collins bought the small saltbox on the edge of Lake Chauncy , the real estate agent assured the St. Louis businessman he had selected a secluded setting " where nothing ever changes . " What she did not know then , and townspeople are only learning now , is that her buyer has plans for the 1400 acres of state land on the opposite shore that could bring about the largest single change in the Worcester County town ' s 263-year history . Collins , a former vice president of the Anheuser-Busch brewing company , has won Gov . Edward J. King ' s enthusiastic support for the development of an amusement park on the scale of Disneyland on the site of Westborough State Hospital and the former Lyman School for Boys . The $300 million-$500 million project , to be completed over a 10- year period while the hospital is phased out , would also involve construction of 2.5 million square feet of office space , a 600-room hotel and conference center and an 18-hole golf course on what is now mostly open fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiating with the state for eight months on the details , " says Collins , who formed MEG Enterprises of St. Louis last year to independently explore development prospects here after the beer manufacturer abandoned plans to propose a Busch Gardens amusement park for the state property . Financial backing has not been secured ; architectural and engineeringplans are incomplete ; contact with town officals has been negligible and with townspeople nonexistent , but Collins is " encouraged " and townspeople , whether cynical or supportive , are certain the project is a fait accompli . What the town wants to know , and the developer says it may have to wait months to hear , is whether Routes 9 and 495 will be altered to handle the onslaught of tourists , how the park will cope with water , sewerage and public safety needs and what the town will have to say about the park and the commercial growth it is expected to spawn . Rep. John R. Driscoll , who represents the area , is aware of the questions but excited about the project , after just one meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good a presentation as I ' ve ever seen . He seems to have everything together . He supervised Busch Gardens operations in ( Tampa* Florida and ( Williamsburg* Virgina so he ' s been there ; he knows what he ' s doing . " There are those , like some who don ' t like signs posted on trees , who think it is a terrible idea to do anything with all that grass and trees . They won ' t like this but they wouldn ' t like anything . " In the doorways and the shops around the South street rotary , it is the developer ' s air of confidence that residents cite with enthusiasm or derision when they talk about the park that would attract an estimated 40,000 tourists per day and 10,000 new jobs to their town of 13,610 . " I think if every person in town voted against it , the state would do it anyway , " says Paul Fallon , one of a half dozen men sharing conversation in the cramped back room of Lowe ' s Variety Store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are made . Fallon , co-owner of a local lumberyard , has no argument with any plan that will place state property on the town ' s tax rolls but he suspects " we aren ' t going to be able to stand in its way even if we were crazy enough to want to . " Find the people with reservations about it and you ' ll find the people who moved out here from Boston or Framingham looking for a quiet rural town , " says Fallon , who was born here . " Well , those people were kidding themselves . We are the crossroads of Massachusetts with ( Routes* 90 , 495 and 9 coming together here . Westborough was destined for bigger things . If not this , something else . Let them keep moving . Why should the people who live here suffer so they can look at trees ? " One doesn ' t have to look far for those " newcomers " whose efforts to organize opposition to the proposed development have been hampered by the dearth of information about the project . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for three of the 13 years she has lived in town , says : " Busch Gardens is a place I might visit once in my life . I don ' t want to live there . " When my husband was in graduate school , we had an opportunity to live in Buffalo , off Niagara Falls boulevard . It was like tinsel alley leading to the tourist attraction . I don ' t want to see that here . " Barbara Goff , a 12-year resident who counts herself among those attracted here by the charm of small-town New England , describes the proposed park as " mind-boggling to say the least . The way we know Westborough as a town will be gone forever . " Many of us are concerned that so much of the planning has been going on behind the scenes . I think the town should start demanding some answers . " Selectman Alan F. Dodd , a local attorney , says town officials have been asking a lot of questions and getting few answers since last fall when rumors of the proposed development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been officially advised about it , " Dodd notes . " There was some initial contact with a few officials but nothing has been filed with the town yet , which is more than a little surprising . Until they tie up the financing , they tell us , they aren ' t showing us anything . " We probably wouldn ' t have known about this at all if it weren ' t for rumors and supposition . I don ' t understand all this secrecy , to be perfectly honest with you . " The questions townspeople are posing concern the anticipated strain on traffic , the water supply and sewer service , fire safety and plans to control spinoff growth . " They are all legitimate questions , " Collins acknowledges , " and we do plan to answer them . But until we have everything in place we don ' t feel in a position to make a formal presentation . We want to be sure we have all the answers . " To deal with the traffic problem , Collins has hired the Boston engineering firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the state Department of Public Works , to draft plans for the expansion of Route 9 from four to six lanes in the four-mile stretch leading to the site and the addition of an interchange off Route 495 . Both changes had been proposed previously by a coalition of high technology industries which have located in the area in the last few years . " We are hoping our project will just push those plans along , " Collins says . What reservations exist about the physical impact of the project are intensified by its perceived threat to home rule . " I feel kind of sad because we have no choice . It will happen and we will have had no part in the decision , " says Meninger , reflecting the fatalism of many of her neighbors who have seen the state and federal government overrule local decisions before . Variety store owner James Lowe , who says the park " would put us on the map , " contends , " If you had local control , nothing would ever go in there . You could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the protection of a town by-law that would require the developer to secure a zoning change before any construction could beginsuspect the state could circumvent that ordinance if it was determined to see the project implemented . That suspicion is deepened by the fact that Gov . King last March filed legislation that included the provision that " no local or municipal regulation or restriction shall affect or restrict the disposition of surplus land . . . " The measure died in the House Ways and Means Committee " but there is some concern that he might try to bypass home rule with a bill like that again this year , " says Dodd . David L. Flynn of the Executive Office of Administration and Finance , designated by King last month to keep abreast of the project ' s progress , says there are no plans to reintroduce that measure . " You can ' t ride rough-shod over a town on something like this , " he says . " I think the town is concerned because this started in the governor ' s office and these things usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor ' s attention . " The man who got the governor ' s attention for Collins was John Ryan , president of the Boston real estate firm of Ryan , Elliott , &; Co . Inc. , who three years ago helped Anheuser Busch locate the site . " The governor was disappointed when Anheuser pulled out . But he is excited again because this means jobs for Massachusetts , " Ryan says . Before construction can begin , state agencies now housed in the Lyman School must be relocated ; the Legislature must declare the entire 1400 acres surplus property , authorize independent appraisals and approve the sale ; and , finally , a special town meeting must approve the zoning change . " If we can get the zoning change and the title transferred this year , we ' ll be on schedule , " Collins says .
