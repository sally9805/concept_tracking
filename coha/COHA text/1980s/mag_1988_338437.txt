When journalism 's brightest luminaries gathered at a black-tie dinner last month to celebrate the 75th anniversary of Columbia University 's Graduate School of Journalism , there was one conspicuous absence : the school 's dean . The university had been unable to fill that prominent post ever since former Newsweek Editor in Chief Osborn Elliott resigned two years ago . Last week Columbia President Michael Sovern finally announced a successor : Joan Konner , 57 , a veteran television-documentary producer and a Columbia trustee since 1978 . " She 's been a very serious possibility from the beginning , " said Sovern . " We did n't want anyone to think that we 'd gone soft and were just taking the easy way out .

As many as three candidates were reportedly offered the job but declined after taking stock of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ) , a deteriorating physical plant and a fractious faculty have led many educators to conclude that Columbia , the most prestigious journalism school in the country , is resting on its laurels . " It needs a shot in the arm right now , " says Professor Karen Rothmyer . <P> Konner , the first woman to hold the job , seems well prepared for what she calls the " challenge of helping journalism define itself . " A 1961 graduate of the school , she boasts an impressive set of journalistic credentials , including more than 20 years as a documentary producer for NBC News and public television , where she has had a long partnership with Bill Moyers . " She 's a solid , substantive journalist with lots of integrity , " says Professor Kenneth Goldstein . Equally important , Konner is said to be a good administrator who knows how to raise money . From her spot on the university board , she was acutely aware of what she calls the school 's " noble search to find the Holy Grail . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either they gave up or they found it .
