That ' s what they ' re doing to the docks and the ships . The burly longshoremen with shirts painted over hard muscles are all but gone . Their days of swinging heavy hooks into burlap bags and carrying the load down bouncing gangplanks are almost over. // And the cornucopias of break-bulk ships are disappearing , too . These ships , with their small cranes lifting pallets and nets heavily loaded with a wide variety of cargo , from fruit to tires , from paper to engines , are also harder to find in US ports today. // In place of romance , the people who build the ships and the equipment to load and unload them have brought forth computer-controlled gantry cranes , ro/ro ( roll on , rol off ) vessels , and even a " moustrap. " // After centuries of using basically the same technology to handle oceangoing cargo  --  with vessels just becoming larger and faster  --  ship and port technology has almost completely changed in less than 25 years . In the last year or so , new ships and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution in cargo handling even further. // One word best sums up the need for new port technology : money . Perhaps more than mot other businessmen , ship operators have pinned down the costs of their vessels and crew . Not counting the volatile price of fuel to run the behemoths , it costs about $14 , 000 a day to operate a typical container ship carrying some 1 , 400 twenty-foot-equivalent , containers , known as TEUs , says Dr. Ernst G. Frankel , professor to ocean systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. // For these ships , DR . Frankel says , time spent in the docks loading or unloading , or  --  even worse  --  waiting in the harbor for a berth , is time better spent at sea . The less time a ship spends in port , the more trips it can make in a year and the more money it can earn . Thus port operators who can offer the fastest " turnaround time " do a better job of attracting ships. // To shorten this time and get ships in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced in recent years . One of these comes from Matson Navigation Systems , San Francisco . The key to the system is nicknamed the " mousetrap , " as in " to build a better mousetrap . " It is a compact container conveyor that stands by the ship as it is unloaded by the shipside crane . Normally , when the crane removes a container it is placed on a truck chassis or railroad flatcar , then moved to a stacking area. // With the Matson system , the container is placed on the conveyor , or " mousetrap " where it is picked up by a yard gantry that looks sort of like a giant coffee table on wheels . The gantry lifts the container from the mousetrap and slides it to a stack , or onto a truck or train. // Besides speeding up the loading and unloading process , the mousetrap eliminates the straddle carriers that traditionally moved containers around ports . These carriers , which cost over $300 , 000 each , are costly to maintain , needing some $80 , 000 worth of upkeep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Says Matson spokesman Charles E. Regal , only two container facilities are being equipped with the mousetrap . The company is spending some $28 million to install the system at its own Los Angeles facility , scheduled to be ready this fall . A smaller version opened last year in the Port of Richmond , Calif. , in San Francisco Bay. // The equipment at both of these facilities , and at a growing number of ports today , is computer-controlled . The clipboard is being replaced by a computer terminal that can identify all the containers in a port , tell what they contain , where they ' re from , and where they ' re going . The computer quicklytells a port manager the exact order for loading the containers on the ship. // While new ways to unload ships are being introduced , new ships are coming along as well . One of the more dramatic comes from Barber Blue Sea and is known immodestly  --  but accurately  --  as the Supercarrier. // Barber Blue Sea , A consortium of Norwegian , British , and Swedish firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers with the ability to handle any type of cargo in all port situations. " // There are six of the $33 million vessels that can carry up to 1 , 80 containers , or 2. 2 million cubic feet of uncontainerized cargo . While the containers can be loaded by conventional dockside cranes , the ship ' s most distinghishing feature is a 40-feet-wide stern ramp that sticks straight up from the after port of the vessel when it is at sea . When it is unfolded , it can reach 163 feet from the ship so cargo can be driven aboard. // With the two-lane ramp , the ship can perform like a ro/ro vessel , loading everything from compact cars , heavy earth movers , buses , pleasure boats , and anything else that can be put on wheels or a trailer . The only requirement for the port is that the water be deep enough for the ship . Absolutely no developed port facilities are necessary , says Ole Hafsten , a Barber Blue Sea vice-president and general manager of the company ' s North American operations. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what many see as a trend toward increasing containerization . But he maintains : " We see that there will always be a need for ocean transportation of cargo that can not be put into containers. " // He said his group ' s ships also meet a need for ever-larger vessels capable of carrying huge loads . These ships , he says , could well become " mother ships , " which call at only one port in a geographic area  --  the North Atlantic ports on the East Coast , for instance  --  and are " fed " by smaller boats and barges coming from the other ports in the area. // " The economies of scale would seem to call for this course , " he commented. // In the future , says Professor Frankel of MIT , port operators will be looking closely at ways to handle the same  --  or a growing  --  amount of cargo in far less space . This will be especially necessary in places where containerization is growing rapidly despite a shortage of land to store the boxes. // one such place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports , Dr. Frankel says , is Hong Kong . There , containers are stored 10-high in parallel racks , each container in its own pigeonhole . A similar system is under construction in Barcelona , Spain. // Dr. Frankel says future port development may be installations . Prefabricated ports can be built in a shipyard and floated to the site , then sunk on a prepared bottom . There are none of these yet in the United States , he notes , but they are used in Saudi Arabia , Indonesia , and Venezuela. // //
