A bold way to beat the heat <P> Rising out of a field on the campus of Princeton University is an eerie-looking Dacron-covered dome that suggests a wayward spaceship . Inside is something that looks either like a miniature Matterhorn or perhaps a giant Sno-Cone wrapped in plastic . In fact , the mound is the tip of an iceberg . Beneath it , nestled into a 10-ft. - deep hole in the ground , is a thick heap of slowly melting ice . To its creator , Theodore Taylor , a nuclear physicist turned alternative-energy researcher , the pile of ice is proof that there are better and cheaper ways than air conditioning to cool people off on a hot day . <P> Taylor calls his invention an ice pond , and the way it works is astonishingly simple . Basically , the pond is nothing more than a 60-ft. - wide plastic-lined hole in the ground filled with ice . To make the ice , Taylor last winter used a snowmaking machine similar to those found at ski resorts . Instead of making actual snow , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substance that was roughly the consistency of wet sherbet , which was squirted into the hole . The water part of the slush drained to the bottom , leaving ice granules above . A system of pipes and pumps drew off the ice water from the bottom of the pond , and it was recirculated by other pipes and pumps back to the snowmaker . The water was then sprayed out onto the pile all over again , as slush , adding still more ice granules to the growing mound . After several weeks , a compact mound of ice about 30 ft. thick had been formed . <P> As summer has progressed , the mound of ice has begun to melt slowly , sending ice water trickling down through the granules to the bottom of the pond . <P> The collector pipes are now gathering the ice water and pumping it to a nearby building , where it is being circulated through cooling vents in the rooms . <P> By the end of the summer , most of the ice in the pond will have melted , but the temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at little more than 32 F , or that of true ice water . Meanwhile , the building is staying at a comfortable 70 F. Of course , the ice ponds could only be used for buildings with a large amount of empty land near by . It would take about 100 tons of ice , or enough to fill a 20-sq. - ft. hole 10 ft. deep , to cool the average American home from spring to autumn . <P> Though Taylor 's test pond has not yet completed its first full summer of operation , Prudential Insurance is already planning its own ice pond , to cool a building now being built by the firm on land adjoining the Princeton campus . Engineers estimate that the company will save as much as $10,000 to $15,000 in annual electrical costs by using ice-pond cooling instead of standard air conditioning . <P> Engineering extravaganzas are nothing new to Taylor . As a nuclear scientist at Los Alamos , N. Mex. , in the 1950s , he designed the largest fission bomb that had ever been exploded . In the 1960s he worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborted fission-powered spaceship that was supposed to explore the solar system . For now , Taylor is happy with his melting ice mound . Says he : " Standing on that pile of ice is pure adventure . We are developing the first renewable-energy cooling system that is competitive with electrical air conditioning . "
