de-fect : Warmed up out of cold storage . From Latin defectus , past participle of deficere , to leave or desert . The Polish diplomats , fishermen and the woman cellist who have fled to the West since the imposition of martial law are only the latest in a long series of Cold War defectors . There have been so many over the past quarter-century - East Germanfamilies in a balloon and Russian ballet dancers on tour , Czech tennis stars with ease and Lithuanian seamen with difficulty - that it comes as somewhat of a surprise to discover that " defect , " as a political ( but not particularly complimentary ) usage , was ruled obsolete by the Oxford English Dictionary barely a half-century ago . The Oxford dictionarians found " defect " to be in use from the mid- 16th century into the 1800s , usually in a perjorative turn-traitor sense , with their final citation - " The native troops and gunners defected . . . " - coming from a report on the Sepoy Rebellion which convulsed India in 1857-58 . This political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usage meaning fault or imperfection remained current ( especially for consumers ) . Without explanation , the political usage was revived in the OED ' s 1972 Supplement , with a flight of citations from mid-50s press reports on Cold War defections . The celebrated defections from those years were mainly of the West-to-East variety , which may explain why the old word with its strong connotations of fault/imperfection ( apparently acceptable when the talk is of " native gunners " ) was revived , almost euphemistically , rather than a more positive word coined . A typical usage comes in Chris Scott ' s thriller " To Catch a Spy , " based on the Burgess-Maclean-Philby defections . On the television , there had been " mug shots of Guy Burgess looking like a blotchier version of Dylan Thomas , and Maclean looking like Sir Donald Diplomat ; then the polite , embarrassed remarks of a Foreign Office spokesman - well , yes , you could say they were traitors , through the term defectors ' was preferable . " A thoughtful account of an East-West defection , Whittaker Chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chambers uses " deserter " rather than " defector " to describe himself and other underground agents who came over to the West during the 1930s and 40s , and suggests the negative connotation of " defector " in the sense of doing the wrong thing - or at least not the smart thing . " I wanted my wife to realize one long-term penalty . . . of the step I was taking , " Chambers wrote . " I said : You know , we are leaving the winning world for the losing world , ' I meant that , in the revolutionary conflict of the 20th century , I knowingly chose the side of probable defeat . " Although the Polish diplomat may be welcomed at the White House - and the ballet dancers and tennis players become rich and famous beyond their dreams - the word we welcome them with ( " Poland ' s envoy to US defects " was the Globe headline ) either reflects unconscious disapproval or , more likely , is a negative word caught in the process of acquiring a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
