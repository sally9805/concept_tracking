Farmers are not the only ones praying for rain . The drought has also meant big trouble for Chubb , the 16th largest U.S. property and casualty insurer ( assets : $9.2 billion ) . Reason : the Warren , N.J. , company inadvertently plunged too deep into the rain-insurance business . Chubb 's policies , designed to reimburse farmers for crop damage due to low rainfall , sold faster than roadside lemonade in ten Midwestern and Southern states last June , before the full impact of the drought was apparent . By the June 15 application deadline , Chubb 's independent managing agent , Good Weather International of Jericho , N.Y. , had received more than 8,700 applications for $350 million in coverage . &; That was nearly 70 times the amount of rain insurance Chubb sold last year . Stunned by the size of its potential liabilities , Chubb in July placed a $40 million limit on Good Weather 's sales , refused to issue 6,200 policies , and offered to refund twice the amount of the premium checks , or about $20 million . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last week to consolidate their lawsuits into one national class action against Chubb . In most states , insurance laws dictate that coverage can not be canceled once the initial premium is paid . Among Chubb 's defenses : it did not realize that Good Weather agents had oversold the policies , mostly within two days of the deadline , without permission . But the plaintiffs counter that Chubb , which specializes in up-scale homeowners ' and commercial insurance , has been in the business for more than a century and should know how to monitor demand . Insurance authorities in at least five states are considering whether to seek revocation of Chubb 's licenses to write insurance in their states . <P> Even so , many farmers would rather not have to hold Chubb to its word . Says Iowa Plaintiff Lewis Schoening , 52 , who farms 1,200 acres and expects to lose two-thirds of his corn crop and almost half his soybeans if the dry weather continues : " I 'd sure rather have the rain than the insurance .
