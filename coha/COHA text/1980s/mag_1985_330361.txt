It was just eleven years ago that Mikhail Baryshnikov slipped away from a touring troupe of Soviet dancers in Canada for a new life in the West . He was instantly acclaimed as a once-in-a-lifetime performer of genius . Who could miss his radiant classicism , his ardent romantic style , his deportment as a diffident young god ? Never presenting himself on- or off-stage as " a star , " he had a solitary air that his huge blue eyes only underscored . In fact he was starting out with only schoolboy French , no English , no clear idea of where to settle or which dance company to join . <P> Today his style is still pure , and his commitment to ballet as strong . But his life has fleshed out . For one thing , he has embraced America with gusto . Now he runs his own company , American Ballet Theater . He speaks bravura English , full of vivid slang and the silly puns that Russians seem to love . " Let 's see , how American am I ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fan or a Forty-Niner , and I do n't like Coca-Cola or pink shirts . But I love television , fast cars and corn . That 's pretty American . " <P> Baryshnikov left the cosseted life at Leningrad 's Kirov Ballet , where artistic challenges were rare and cultural politics strangulating . " I did n't have the patience , and I 'm not smart enough , " he says . " I love that country and those people , but I am an individualist , and there it is a crime . " <P> If freedom means choice , then Baryshnikov reveled in it , pursuing myriad options . He has worked with a dozen or so choreographers . With Twyla Tharp 's brilliant Push Comes to Shove ( 1976 ) , his flair for comedy burst out . In 1977 he became a Hollywood star , playing a famous dancer in The Turning Point . ( Another film , White Nights , will be released at Christmas . ) The lorn Petrouchka began to seem like a Slavic Jimmy Cagney . <P> Home turned out to be New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick , efficient intelligence . " It 's mesmerizing to be here , " he says . " The speed , every day 's information , even the anger of the place . " When he became artistic director at A.B.T. nearly five years ago , he dove into a Sargasso Sea of arts administration and emergency fund raising . He has survived and has strengthened the troupe . " It 's been tough but worth it , " he says . " I 've seen all the existing companies , including the Russian ones , and I am very proud . " <P> At 37 , he appears to be relaxing his pace a bit . Says a friend who has known him since 1975 : " This is one immigrant who took immigration very seriously . " He has applied for American citizenship and has no thoughts of returning to the Soviet Union . " I have an American child , " he says , speaking of Shura , 4 , his daughter with Actress Jessica Lange . " It still amazes me that she talks without a Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
