Atheist 's son finds God <P> Madalyn Murray O'Hair became the nation 's best-known atheist in 1963 when , partly as a result of her suit , the U.S. Supreme Court forbade mandatory prayers in public schools . A fellow plaintiff in protesting Bible reading and/or recitation of the Lord 's Prayer in Baltimore schools was her teen-age son William J. Murray III . He went on to become a publisher , but later joined his mother in Austin , Texas . In 1975 he reorganized the headquarters of her American Atheists and revived its monthly magazine . In 1977 he broke with his mother and tried to start a rival atheist organization . <P> In a letter in the Austin American-Statesman , William , 33 , now says he believes in God and is apologizing to the nation for helping build up his mother 's " personal empire , " and for his adolescent efforts against school prayer . William has not joined any particular denomination , but he feels that " the best way to survive on this planet is through faith in a higher power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to their beliefs , " but " faith is a strong binding force that can help any individual . " <P> Madalyn O'Hair refuses to discuss William 's apostasy directly . She issued a joint statement , however , with her other son Jon , and William 's 14-year-old daughter Robin , who lives with her .

" Puzzled , William responds that there is no money in it for him .
