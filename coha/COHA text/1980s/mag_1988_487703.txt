to teach . It was his perpetual discomfiture rather than Oswald 's simmering anguish that came to be the focus of the evening , and this gave the play a flavor more of Shaw than of Ibsen , but it was engrossing for all that . Fionnula Flanagan , a Los Angeles-based actress who has specialized in bringing Joyce to the stage , was Mrs. Alving , on whose shoulders falls the task of delivering Ibsen 's most potentially portentous lines , including , several times , the title , delivered sotto voce to underline significant moments of action . She did it as naturally as saying hello . The one thing she could n't do was to get Raphael Sbarge to emote , and so her scenes with her son were like watching a tennis pro play against a concrete wall . The play is worth seeing , even so , for the sheer mechanical perfection of Ibsen 's script , in which there is not one word that does not advance the plot , nor any stretch of exposition that is not , also , tingling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck to have remained innocent of what the story is about , I urge you to see the play with a maiden imagination . Finally , two offerings by the Pearl Theatre , on West Twenty-Second Street . After seeing the first of them , a zestful rendering of She Stoops to Conquer , and perusing its list of past and future productions , I thought that I had come upon the beau ideal of Off-Off-Broadway repertory companies . In a long , narrow shopfront space , with only some seventy-two seats , the Pearl staged Goldsmith 's amiable comedy ( perhaps the least offensive masterpiece in all world drama ) with more finesse and theatrical intelligence than is to be found in all three concurrent productions at the Public Theatre . ( Which , besides Corrolanus , is home to Richard Foreman 's What Did He See ? and an innocuous waxwork of a comedy from 1942 , Cafe Crown , concerning either of which the less said the better . ) The entire , largish cast entered into the festive spirit of Goldsmith 's play as though they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unlike the performance of Farquhar that is the focus of Thomas Kenneally 's recent novel The Playmaker . In describing how the first group of convicts transported to Australia stage The Recruiting Officer , Kenneally has shown what is timeless and most to be treasured in the ephemeral counterworlds of the stage . One lesson easily drawn from his pages , or from such a production as the Pearl 's She Stoops to Conquer , is that good theater is a function not of stars or budgets but of good wnting , high spints and capable acting . Joanne Camp and James Nugent in the leading roles were more than capable , but they must share applause with Bonnie Horan , Patrick Tull , Robin Leslie Brown and Tim O'Hare . When so many actors need be praised , necessarily the director , Bob Verini , must be honored , particularly as this production appears to have been his first undertaking on such a scale . ( Watchers of the TV program Jeopardy may already be acquainted with Verini : He was last year 's grand prize winner . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl 's next production , Racine 's Berenice , did not at all measure up to its Goldsmith . In extenuation of the failure it must be said that almost any English-language production of Racine is liable to come a cropper for lack of actable translations . But even allowing for the sea change between languages , French classicism requires an acting style within the range of few English-speaking actors . The trick is to embody ( and give voice to ) a kind of animated Platonic figure , to become the embodiment of a Raphael painting , with extravagant gestures but noble withal . If the principals entrusted with the roles ( including Joanne Camp , who handled Goldsmith 's demands effortlessly ) were not equal to such , they can be blamed only for reaching beyond everyone 's grasp . Almost no one ? including Glenda Jackson ? brings off Racine in English . SUrely the Pearl will have more success with the final three plays of its ambitious season : The Philanderer by Shaw , Ibsen 's Hedda Gabler and ( let it be so ) All 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
