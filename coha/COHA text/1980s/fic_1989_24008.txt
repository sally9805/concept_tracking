STORY AMERICANA By Mona Simpson N1 father used to say , by way of consolation for my beautiful tenyear-old sister 's B+ s , " Do n't worry . You know what happened to the very smartest , straight-A students I knew in high school ? They ended up college professors . Teachers . And you know how much they make ? " During that time , my sister was practicing to be a majorette and I remember her stem , perfect leg sticking straight up , wrapped in a saddle shoe . My father grabbed that blunted foot . The leg trembled in its point , a baton tilted in her mouth . I was under the mahogany table , my glasses sliding down over my nose , doing math . I knew I was very advanced for my age . My father noticed me then , my scribbling silenced by the spectacle of a somersault . " Like your brother here who 's practicing to be Einstein and already ruined his eyes .

One year , the man in the electronics store had me almost convinced of a new kind of television from Japan  --  more lines per inch , which makes the picture better . I believed his point , I saw the resolution on the display screen , my credit card was already in his machine when I decided no , I could n't do it . It did n't matter which was better .

My wife and I also sent them on two cruises before they died . One to the Caribbean and one to Alaska . Now I 'm glad we did that . 1 have often thought of the waste practiced in my family . It seems almost everything we did , all the things we worked at  --  my parents and sister were by no means lazy but seem to me in retrospect almost eerily diligent  --  did n't count . My sister 's all-state blue ribbon for back-twirl double-baton toss , my mother 's county-fair prizes for relish six years running , my dad 's fox-trot , famous two counties wide , and his heroism when he got the Felchner girl up out of the well  --  What did they do for us ?

For five and a half years 1 wanted nothing more than to be beautiful over that felt , to shoot clean good shots , and to beat anybody I ever found . Before that I had been years in my room studying magic . I 'd given performances , first at my sister 's sweet-sixteen party then at my parents ' canasta games and anniversaries . At twelve , so many people hired me for their kids ' birthdays , I had to have my own calendar . I passed out cards : CHARLIE WALTERS , AMERICAN ILLUSIONIST , 244 MAPLE STREET , BETWEEN CHESTNUT AND DEWITT , FLINT , KANSAS . RECEIVING PHONE CALLS BETWEEN 7:30 AND 9 . Six o'clock was supper and my father did n't allow calls during dinner . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto pool . Magic was all tricks and not true  --  sleight of hand , deception . People willingly gave you their belief , like a coin on an open palm . Pool was something else . The magic hid in skill . Perfect stroke . When you pocketed a beauty , it really was a beauty . I do n't know . Now they do n't seem so different . I meandered on , a regular guy , until one night a girl in a long Indian-print skirt and about a hundred tiny braids came into Rudy 's Color Bar putting up posters for Anything Goes . She sat at one of the square formica tables and ordered coffee . She made Rudy go back and get her milk for her coffee instead of cream . You can imagine how he liked that . Then she settled with a tight mouth and watched me ace Buddy-Buddy . She probably thought I was just some mess-around kid , but she stared . Have you ever sung ? " was the first thing she said to me . I was already racking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buddy-Buddy , who was chalking his cue for a replay . I took my cue apart and set it in its case . " I 'm not the church-choir type , " I said . Even though I was . Sunday nights , my mother sat at the piano and she and my dad sang sheet music , and until fourth grade ray sister and I both stood in choir . 1 walked out with the braid girl . She turned out to be my high school 's new drama teacher . Who saw something in me . Who acted hard on me . Who got me going on college and a faraway place and a scholarship . She had to teach me , one by one , from the beginning , which things would matter and which ones would n't . It turned out nothing I 'd been doing would . So I changed . Fast . As friends and family watched , I became a worrier , something I 'd never been . And a studier . And a loner . What they did n't know is i 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret for somebody else . ( That first night , she 'd asked , " Can a seventeenyear-old keep a secret ? " It had seemed like a trick question . " No , " I said warily . " I mean , why should a seventeen-year-old have to keep a secret ? " I still could n't believe she was twenty-six . She looked about nineteen to me . ) She sent away for catalogues and together , lying on our bellies , we turned the pages and looked at the color pictures . Harvard , Princeton , Yale . Stanford , which they called The Farm . She had n't been able to go to a place like that because she 'd worked all through high school and her grades were n't good enough . But she would go with me . If got in . She taught me how to make love , but she was a virgin too and love was new as our first snow and as astonishing . But after , I 'd still have to stumble in and find my parents mid-canasta with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yea-high , as Hank Dweeble reminded me with a hand to my knee every time I saw him . The ceilings felt low . The kitchen 's blackand-white linoleum like a checkerboard of planned moves , only to get out . The cherry-log tortes my mother had baked for their refreshment waited on the pantry counter . My parents ' names were George and Martha . Years later , it was a big deal in our family when they dropped Washington and Lincoln for Presidents ' Day . My parents wrote letters to the Gazette . They noticed when I did n't go to the prom . There was a girl named Sally from the year before who clutched her books in front of her tighter and stared down at them whenever I walked near . Word was she had n't got a date . I think her mother finally called my mother to find out what was the matter , if I was just late in the asking or if there was real cause for worry . My mother knocked on my door that night , a light knock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please come in . Of course , what am I going to say to my mom . " Charlie , " she said , " I 'm worried about you . " Then she did something I 'll never forget . She reached out a white hand to touch my forehead the way you would if you were taking someone 's temperature , and she must have seen something funny on my face because she got scared . She waited a moment , mid-air , then gained composure and completed the gesture , touching me . But I think in that moment of stall she recognized I was a man and became shy with me . That night I crawled out my second-story window and down the back porch . 1 ran , hands in my jacket pockets , over the plowed frozen fields to my lover 's apartment . Jody lived in an at-tic with its own separate stairs . She 'd painted it all white and she had a fire-place and a stereo . That night she was listening to Mozart , with candles burning . I found her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She slept on a screened-in porch and it was cold but we could see the moon . I tensed in her arms and we talked about the prom . I told her I wanted to take Sally and was surprised she minded . She sucked her lip . I did n't understand . " Trust me on this one . " I tapped her nose . She was a typical twenty-six-yearold girl , worried about marriage , biting her nails . She worried too much . Sometimes she thought her nails were why she was n't married . The great thing about her was she could tell me all this . I was seventeen . I did n't count . By the end , we decided I would go to my prom but that we would have our own special night the night after , a Sunday . She would make Chinese food from a new book she 'd ordered , approximating with vegetables from around here , and we 'd listen to a whole Dvoiik symphony broadcast from Chicago . This made Sally 's life . After 1 asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She turned into a different presence in the hallway . And I was beginning to notice that , young and silly as she was , and undeserving , Sally really had a beautiful face . The night of the prom she held no grudges . She did n't humble after I 'd ignored her all that year . She watched her own leg hop competently in a dance , lifting her skirt like a pro and wearing only studied expressions . We had a great time dancing . She was four inches taller than me and a wonderful dancer , getting warm and full-checked and sweaty like a boy , before retiring outside to the deck . We stayed on the dance floor , or near it , until the end , after the couples who were really couples left for the woods or for grandfather 's cabins fifty miles away or for sailboats on the lake or , for the very daring , hotel rooms on Route 9 or , at worst , for cars . Jody and I had made love the first time in a car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's . Her car was a Volkswagen , which she 'd slipcovered inside with tartan flannel . We were both small . The backseat had an almost oval window . I remember that window , the exact curve of its corners and the patch of stars . Somebody else asked Sally for one last dance and she accepted the challenge with vigor , skidding up to me in a step at the end , holding her skirts again . She had pretty ankles and she knew it . I did n't know what to say as we left . I took her coat off the standing rack  --  there were only two others left  --  and set it on her shoulders . I opened her car door . " Would you like to go anywhere ? " I asked . " Like where ? " " I do n't know . I thought maybe you were hungry . " She snorted . Girls like that could never say anything bad to you , they just breathed it . " No place is gon na be open , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby 's dead , it could n't get air when you stifled it . " " Yeah , you 're right , " I said . " Probably no place is. " 1 took her home . When I parked in front of her house , all dark , I could make out the familiar arch shaped hay window . I paused a second before jumping out and getting her door . " Are you having an affair with Miss Gregory ? " Sally McCulsky had probably never said anything that direct in her life . And though I 'd promised on everything I loved I 'd never tell anyone and I 'd meant to keep that promise , I told Sally , because she asked . " Yeah . But it 's not what you think . " And the way she nodded , with expected bitterness , I believed she would never tell anybody either . I walked her to the door . She opened it  --  it was unlocked  --  and slipped in without saying another word . That was all many years ago . With Tulsa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Flint , works at the pizza joint , and owns a Harley-Davidson . He never married anybody else . That motorcycle is like a book he 's writing all his life , you know , he 's always buying parts for it and fixing it . He came to Barbie 's wedding late and with a huge gauzed hand  --  he 'd cracked up his bike the night before . I did n't have a date for the wedding either  --  Jody would n't come and I did n't ask anybody else . That night I stood in front of Barbie 's empty closet . She left three letterman jackets behind . When she broke the engagement to Buddy-Buddy , Hank Dweeble had said , " Barbie , I 'm a lawyer and I see divorces all day long coming in and out of my office . Let me give you some advice . Marry a John or a Joe or a Dave . I 've never divorced a Joe . It 's these Harolds and Jessies and Jasons who walk . " Barbie married a Dave . She has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fur collar walked into my car . I felt myself frowning and loosening my tie . I have small hands , dumb hands , and if I do n't catch them before it 's too late , they flutter . My feet tap , I doodle and fidget . I turned out to be a short man , not terribly thin . The woman advancing down the train 's aisle seemed unusual be-cause , unlike the beautiful women I 'd met in my life , she was small , shorter than I am . She seemed almost a miniature . I 'd always considered beautiful women tall and inaccessible . Once in a while you spotted one in academics , lurking in Romance languages . Never in mathematics . The fur lady collapsed into the seat facing me . She was a woman all right , not a girl . I remembered a time in my life when I saw women from a certain angle , a view into a room with the door open only a wedge . Women were strange and tall then , moving liquidly in slips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closets . They left a scent and a rustle as they got ready , lifting bracelets off of mirrored dressers , pulling silk stockings up to their garters . They were perpetually in a state of getting ready . They wore furs and lipstick , their hair nests of wonder and complication . At that time , before fancy shampoos could be bought from every supermarket and second bathrooms became common in houses , women 's long hair had a smell . It was gamey and strong , deep like a fine pelt . They dressed in layers involving secrets and machinery , girdles and the satin froth of lace on slips and bras . My mother was like that , her arm carried the scent of baked apples , her fur cuff brushing my cheek in the snow . When I was a boy , watching my mother , 1 wondered if I would ever grow up to marry such a woman . decided I would have to become very tall . But I had n't . And 1 had n't married such a woman . I looked at this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She probably thought I was laughing at her . I was actually thinking something I 'd thought a lot of times before ; of the wasted prettiness of my sister and Sally and so many girls I knew in Kansas : It opened , it served locally , it was married , swollen to pregnancy , and soon ended  --  in short haircuts , perms , coarser skin , and a life of nervous makeup and hurrying to Sunday morning church on time . What would have happened if one of them had come here ? Anything could have happened . They could have become movie stars or models or at least mar-ried millionaires or been career girls , smoking and running news sections at glossy magazines . I left before they grew up . And where I went , college , I grew and the girls grew too but they were still  --  girls . I married one , at the university chapel . I married Miss Gregory . We did it when I was twenty-one and she twenty-nine . We wanted to be in the same decade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard I 'd fallen for a Vietnamese cellist , but there was no getting away . The thought of Jody alone , sad for me , especially the way she looked after a had haircut in a certain pair of sunglasses , I was overwhelmed with such pity I married her . She had long hair , curly from braids , clothes obvious and functional as my own . She stood two and a half inches shorter than me and she kept beautiful posture . She wore navy blue knee socks under her jeans . I know my wife 's clothes intimately . I 've done both our laundry for years now . In fact , she 's apt to wear my underwear and socks . ( All those years while I studied , we were able to live a certain kind of life . We rented apartments with fireplaces and Jody painted them white and bought rush mats . We owned a stereo and good recordings and had a nice dinner every night , at a table , with cloth napkins . She learned how to make pasta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow-drying a Peking duck in our New Haven basement . ) Jody feels in her element here at Princeton . She 's gone back to school now herself , getting a Ph.D . I 've never seen her so happy since the very beginning when she was planning all this education for me . It turns out , all along , it was n't some secret knowledge she 'd had . She 'd wanted all this for herself , it was a wish and she 'd made it up as well as she could while we were going along . " You 're married " was the first thing the fur woman on the train said to me . She tapped her own wedding finger , where there was no ring . Her hands were less done up than the rest of her . Her nails looked short and her fingers kind of blunt . My wife has beautiful hands . " Yes , unfortunately , I am . " Her head shifted , alert to what , though ? My Kansas accent ? Irony ? My voice fell low with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to propose ? " She smiled largely now . I knew how to work women like this . I had a few in my classes every year . Her lipstick was pink , and with her mouth open , I saw gums . " Not to you . You 're already married . " She sighed , and with that moved her whole body in the seat . She pulled her knees up to her chest . She was wearing some sort of pants that fit very closely . I could see everything , as my mother would have said , that there was to see . " One part I do n't like about being a woman is not getting to propose . Maybe I will anyway . Maybe propose to my husband . " " And not to me ? l proposed to several women , not only my wife . Tell me your name and I 'll consider it . " " Martha . " Her name was Martha . My mother 's name was Martha . That fact struck me like something physical in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry ? " " Your name . " " Oh , Charlie Walters . " I stretched out my arm over the aisle between us , but just then the train lurched . " Mr. Walters . Does your wife know about these proposals ? " " No . I mean , she knows about the one to her . " I proposed to the cellist in Boston . It was kind of a joke , I mean it was hardly serious . But it is true that no one ever knew . " Oh . " Her eyebrows changed . I imagined I saw wariness . " How many times ? " " But we 've only just met , Miss what-is-it ? " She did n't answer me , she turned away , faced the window . I thought of my parents ' souffl ? story that my sister and I had heard all our childhood . He 'd taken her to some restaurant and the cook had baked a ring in the souffl ? . That 's what this woman wanted to hear . " Only once before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've been married eleven years . I 'm an old married person . " " You do n't look old enough to be married eleven years . " " Good . I 'm not . " I do n't have illusions about being handsome , but I want to look young . This Martha asked me questions about my wife . She probably wanted to get married herself . You could tell . " Do you rub her head and give her advice ? " she asked . " Mmhmm . I feel like a psychia-trist . " She nodded happily , as if that was what she 'd wanted to hear . " So that 's why you want to get married . The head rubs . " She shrugged . " What else ? " She asked me what I did . , , Dor " For a living , I meant . " I told her I was a college professor . I stuttered over that quickly . She seemed like the kind of woman who 'd share my father 's views . She probably looked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . I told her that I was on leave for the year at the Institute for Advanced Studies . Einstein had been there . She probably did n't know that but just my knowing it made me feel better . " What do you do there ? " " Oh , nothing . I try to do nothing at all . " She persisted , though . She seemed so sincere . I was n't used to that . It seemed a trait peculiar to the young . She did n't seem to get irony . But no , it was n't that . She was quick . I could see that in her face . She just did n't like it . She seemed to brush my jokes away , the way my mother collected crumbs from the table in her other palm . In Kansas , a hundred years away by talk that way . For my part , I learned some pretty disturbing things . She was a model , age twenty-six , not cover girl or runway . " Too short , " she said levelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Jersey where she modeled for a swimsuit mail-order catalogue . She told me the money was good . Then , when 1 thought she 'd said what she was going to say , she blurted out , " I was having an affair with the owner . He was supporting me . But now that 's over , and this is my last season . I need the money to go back to school . " " College ! " I asked , I hope delicately . In my life , I do n't really meet anyone who does n't expect a fine education . This Martha-on-the-train was obviously bright , but then she was a model . I did n't want to insult her . I wanted to ask other things too . wanted to know how old the man was , how many there had been . It was like you 'd expect from how she looked . My wife would have smirked . " I went to three years of Bible college . And quit that a long time ago . I want to start over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll go next fall . " A student , my most interesting two years back , had posed for Playboy her freshman summer . They did a fall issue on Ivy League coeds . Vanessa was her name . Martha turned her head to the window so her profile was set against the old green velvet of the seat . From the front she looked cute , even all-American , with the childish sprinkle of freckles across her nose . But from the side there was classic beauty , with its hint of cruelty . Her lips pressed out , full and creased , her cheekbones struck high and harsh . We hushed because the train was clattering into Pennyslvania Station . Going up to New York always lifted and then stalled my breath , some at the top of my lungs . I was supposed to deliver the first in a series of lectures at the Public Library . She was going home , I guessed . She put her feet up on my seat . Her ankles , encased in patterned black stockings , were small but well shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has always existed , shoes my mother had worn , that young girls now apparently bought , shoes my wife would never own . My wife had squarish suede sandals imported from Germany , known for their comfort . She would never wear fur . It looked old-fashioned and glamorous to me . My sister had subscribed to the Barbie Doll Monthly when she was a child , and under the canopy of her bed we read about people having their portraits painted and men lifting dotted fur stoles off women 's shoulders . My fingers flickered near the outer bone of Martha 's ankle . I understood that if I took my hand away the touch would seem accidental , unfelt by me , caused by the rocking and slight lurch of the train , But I left my hand there on her ankle , looking around the train . as if bored . I ever so slightly moved my fingertips on her heel . Wow . eird greenish lights came on when the train stopped in the tunnel and there was noise over a loudspeaker and all kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal rack , and she just sat there a moment , doing nothing . Then she yawned and smiled up at me . Her chin was pointy and narrow . Was her physiognomy what made her smile give such an impression of wisdom ? She was a woman in whom even laughter held a trace of faint sadness . My briefcase , a gift from my mother-in-law , knocked against my thigh as we walked . " Are you going home ? " You had to almost shout in those tunnels . " No. l wish . Going out . " I followed her to a turnstile that led to the subway . " Where are you from ? " Her face turned uncertain . " Like originally , 1 mean . " " Nebraska . " " Oh . " She smiled a good-bye . I wanted to do more , maybe ask for her phone number , but all I did was yell , " Hey ? " She turned . " You take that train a lot , the 3:50 ? " " Wednesdays , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last car , and she came on again at Metuchen . It was easy to talkbecause she knew so much about me . She seemed like an old friend . She put her feet up on my armrest . This time she was wearing what looked like really fashionable boots . Somewhere before Newark she unzipped them and took her legs out . " Mmmhmm , " she said . When I grew up in the Midwest , those pretty , energetic girls must have had all those sighs and relapses , but we could n't see them . They hid them from us . The one thing that might have let me love them . I attended every game my sister performed in , throwing the baton , her legs strict in short white boots . She was better than the other majorettes  --  her movements had more precision and angularity , her throws more abandon , more risk . That was the thing about our family : I grew up thinking my mom was better than other mothers , my dad taller and more good than other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salina and Hectorsville . Jody Gregory had to teach me that whole other scales existed on which our virtues would n't show . My sister practiced in our small front yard every morning before breakfast . I woke up to the streak of white appearing in my second-story window and the clop of her catch again , metal on the grayed cotton glove . l 'd go downstairs , she 'd be nimbly walking to the front porch . bending over to bring in the paper and the cold , beaded bottles of milk and cream . It was seven o'clock . My mother , in an apron , would be lifting muffins out of the oven . You never saw them weak . " Tired ? " " Yeah , but I should n't be , " Martha said . " 1 sleep too much . " Under the boots , Martha had on tight black slacks with stirrups and , inside those , knitted cream-colored socks . She seemed as neat and pretty underneath as what showed . I imagined that as she undressed there would be no disappointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no scars , no signs of age , decay , of messiness ...

" I like your boots , " I said.cember , she sat next to me , not across , and we rode from Elizabeth to Manhattan in the dark , her facing the window , me behind rubbing her shoulders and her neck , her forehead , her arms and hands , her lower back . We stopped talking . It seemed all right . I mean , I knew it was n't great but even when I 'd been twenty-one in a brown suit at the ecumenical center altar with strangers for witnesses taking my vows , I knew I 'd have to make it up sometime , being young . And this was another one from the Midwest , the way I might have been if I had n't met Jody . It was still innocent .

" It does n't matter , " I said . he next Wednesday she pressed on lipstick while the train moved evenly toward Manhattan . She slid forward on the tattered seat , so her back arched , giving her tiny rump a childlike pertness . She took a round mirror from her bag , holding it in one hand in front of her . The other hand carefully outlined her lips with a pencil . Telephone poles and green-gray trees turned like spokes outside , and I watched them and her . She held the little makeup bag tightly between her knees . I saw inside the open zipper : the solid-colored round jars and gold tops looked like billiard balls and the coins and cards and scarves inside my magic prop bag . Smokestacks appeared and clouds etched the air with the permanence of cold . We were crossing industrial New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to imagine life inside .

I would walk to the library , she would go I did n't know where . I wanted to touch her , lay a hand on her shoulder . I 'd touched her for weeks now , a light curl down her spine with the back of my fingers would be okay . But I did n't , not because I worried about permission , but because she was concentrating . She painted on lipstick with a brush . This was her work . There was an intentness to her , a diligence I recognized that equaled my own . I 'd been this way with pool and magic too . More than in my wife 's dissertation , her pleasure in the every-otherFriday discussion group , I believed in Martha 's will . She was stubborn , with a tough resolve to make something of herself . My wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make something of me . I decided I 'd buy a Vogue for next Wednesday , and we 'd sit on the train and turn the pages slowly and Martha would teach me things . I even wanted to learn about the chemical bases of makeup , all of it , and when she told me details , I remembered the names with no effort . All the glass skyscrapers suspended by threads and wishes , calculation , all the honors in the world , nights of cocktail parties , toasts in foreign cities , arms reaching out to find my hand , dinners with older , accomplished men who knew my name . None of that mattered next to this  --  her effort and her little pride , her will and that the world not disappoint it . Jody had once asked me if I 'd give my life for her and I 'd said I would .

" She was glad to tell me . " Cornstarch , " she said . " It holds everything and mattes it a little so it does n't shine . See . " I would have given anything then to watch her at home before her own mirror , rising on the balls of her feet , stepping back , licking her finger and wiping the comer of her eye  --  just like that , frankly , with confidence . You fall in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed with absorption . Jody stared at me that first night shooting pool . I imagined Martha 's face bare , a way I 'd never seen it : young and freckled , smooth and moving as a body . She would wear her hair tied up and set about her work matterof-facrly , as if she were mopping the floor , doing it very well . Then she began to show me a new way to make up her eyes . I thought of Jody . I should take notes and learn so I could show Jody how . I was really married . It went deep . That was a dumb thought though because Jody hated makeup . She would say something insulting . She talked about makeup and high heels in the same breath as foot binding . She felt an aversion to anything fancy , artificial , made-up . Her taste favored the natural . She always looked great in Levis . I had a vision of her hair swaying down her back , her hard heels hitting the floor as she walked away . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife 's certainty . She would never dance . She would n't even dance with me at weddings . Martha saw my mouth turn . " You think I 'm a silly woman . And I 'm not smart like you are . I 'm not . " I looked out to the window . Darkness had settled in the spaces around the factories which now- gleamed white and liquid as the Taj Mahal . The noise of the train came back at me . I watched it happen a minute before I moved , her eyes filling with unstable water . It always ended in this . Every time I seemed to blunder into some small , dumb way to hurt her . " Do n't . " I dabbed my cuff at the corner of her eye . I did n't want her to ruin the makeup , undo all she 'd just worked so hard on . " Look . " I unzipped her makeup bag . It was full of red and blue and yellow pots with gold and silver lids . I took the longest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a baton . She rallied , sniffling . I palmed a glitter pencil , gold for the eves , and picked it out of my briefcase . That worked . She was laughing , but then she said , " Ouch . Ow . " I could n't tell for a minute that she was n't still laughing . " I bit the inside of my mouth , it 's bleeding . " " Oh Martha . " Jody went to see her mother in loud buzz blared out from the door lock . She opened the door , standing in athletic clothes , an Ace bandage on her knee . She bent over double , a hand on her lower back . " I just got in from running , If you came ten minutes earlier you would have missed me . " " Would that have been better ? " " No . " But she was n't sure . " It 's strange to see you here . " I walked to the windows . She lived on the thirteenth floor . The windows gave a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the room , greedy , noticing everything . Plaster-work moldings on the ceiling , white paint with flecks of color in it , like mica , brown wicker chairs , a cup of coffee on the floor . I wanted to memorize every detail , they all seemed just right , not only for Martha , but for me . Even the striped shirt hung on the kitchen doorknob seemed to be what my taste had been waiting all my life to find , a way I 'd been meant to live , nothing too fancy or too plain . " Great apartment , " I said . " When I moved in , my friend Tina and I , we scrubbed for two days . It was filthy . 1 like to walk barefoot , and when I moved in the soles of our feet got black . " It seemed to be one of those moments in life when I could do something . Dry afternoon light slanted in through the windows , air and time seemed to slow and fall in a straight line . it reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That kind of ease and quiet . I moved to her , put my hands on her shoulders and kissed her . She skidded away . It was so fast . When I opened my eyes she was four feet away . " I 'm not going to do this . You 're a married man and I 'm not going to have an affair with you . You ca n't just come here and ? " " I did n't mean " She banged a kettle on the stove . Then she was pouring coffee straight into a filter over the cups . I sat at her little table , it wobbled , my hands chastened and folded on the top . " You have to understand about me . I live according to certain rules . " She slammed down my coffee . " I 'm a reli gious person , " she said with a kind of twitch , as if she knew I would n't understand but said it anyway . And I did n't . " I remember you told me you went to Bible college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents or something . And you left . " She shook her head , a piece of hair loosened from the plain rubberband and fell over her cheek . " No . You have it all wrong . That 's not why 1 left . I left because people around me were n't living religious lives . A lot of my classmates were kids of gospel preachers and TV preachers and they were just there to get into the business . They cared more about politics than about God . They were doing drugs , living completely corrupt lives . " The way she said drugs . I did n't know what she would have made of me , at her age . " It was all about connections , I do n't know , it was worse than modeling . But I did n't lose my faith . And I happen to believe in marriage . " Her cheekbones , as her mouth stilled , acquired an aspect of permanence , as if her face with this harsh gaze , its helping of sadness , in this small kitchen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years , forever . " I know . Me too . " " For me , there 's something sacred . " She held her coffee with two hands and blew on the surface . L he stood in front of me before the bathroom mirror . It was like being in one of those small booths , having your picture taken . She grabbed a comb and raked it through my hair , changing the part . She picked up a gold bottle from the ledge of her sink , sprayed out something like shaving cream in her palm , and worked it through my hair so peaks stood up . " Mousse , " she explained . Martha went into her bedroom and left me alone to contemplate " mousse . " I did look really different . I 'd seen men on TV , on the street , even walking the halls of the institute with their hair sticking up like this . Did they all use mousse ? Come to think of it , this was probably the fash-ion now . It had to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . That was an arena I 'd given up long ago . It was n't Jody who 'd stopped me . It was me . My laziness . Math . But perhaps I could have joined the circus after all . I could have gotten the tattoo I 'd thought about and gone on the pool circuit . I 'd thought about an overturned magician 's hat . She came back then , holding two garments on hangers . She tapped them against her lap . " What do you think ? " They were a man 's white shirt and a gray sweater . " For me ? " She took me to the Saigon Restaurant . Sitting across a table , I finally said , " May I ask whose clothes I 'm wearing ? An old boyfriend 's ? " I kept thinking of the guy who owned the swimsuit factory . " My father 's , " she said . " I wear the shirt . The sweater ... the sweater I just have . " She had told me the unkind ways people had treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I now doing just that same thing ? Yeah . When she 'd found her apartment , the woman had not wanted to rent to a model . But Martha touched my wrist and I forgot the slight shame . Martha asked the waitress to bring her own favorite dishes , except without meat or chicken . And the waitress did us well . Everything tasted unrecognizable and delicious . Martha asked me to pass her things and felt no shyness eating a lot . As we talked , her hands worked the table , lifting bowls from under my sleeve , moving glasses to avert my elbows , cutting me a piece of her fish and putting it on my plate . She took bites from my chopsticks . " Look , " she said , and her mouth flickered . She touched her own neck and then pointed her glance at the waitress . I noticed : odd bruises on the waitress 's neck . When she came back , I saw more , inside her elbow , the top of one arm . " You think ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . That 's not from falling . Careful . Do n't stare . " The waitress appeared again with our bill . As we walked hack , Martha told me she 'd once had a shiner , from her boyfriend the swimsuit-factoryartha showed me the paper she was writing . " You 're a professor , " she said . She had a small , neat desk , painted white over layers of chips and scratches , with a pretty manual typewriter she said she 'd bought in New Orleans . She was writing her admissions essay for N YU . She wrote about tending an inner life while being a model in New York City . I had n't worked on a typewriter , much less a manual , for years now , but in an hour , I found myself limber . I rolled up the sleeves of her father 's shirt . We stayed up until two , writing a paragraph , reading it aloud , adding , retyping , finding transitions , discarding a word , changing an image . Finally , we both thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd get in . That 's for sure . She gave me her bed . She took sheets and blankets to the living-room couch for herself . She undressed in the dark . I could half see her slipping on a large T-shirt , the thin gold chain around her neck caught on the collar . Her bed was a futon , straw-smelling , on the floor . I felt oddly safe in it . The apartment seemed smaller in the dark . I heard her mumbling and wondered if she was already talking in her sleep . " What are you doing ? " I put my palm flat on the wood floor beside the futon and it oriented me . It was cold and I knew I could sleep . Finally she answered , but it was a strange voice . " Did you have a good time tonight ? " " Martha , I had a wonderful time tonight . " " Then why do n't you thank God for it . " My head sunk back on the pillow . The cool deep craving for sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from across the room . She was kneeling . Her T-shirt was white , and her hair fell in a loose braid between her shoulders , veering to the left . " How do you pray ? " " I just try . " " Every night ? " " Other times , too . When I work . stand by her . The blankets and sheet were kicked back , one knee bent up to touch an elbow , she was an awkward sleeper . The pendant of her chain was in her mouth . She was wearing underwear , plain underwear , elasticized at the hip , the kind Jody wore and I 'd washed , with my own , every week in the laundry . While she was kneeling before , I felt I could have toppled her . I could imagine lying over her back and both of us breathing together . She mumbled something now in her sleep . " Say my name , " I thought I heard her say . The thought of her lying on her stomach on dark fur flirted through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard , pushed Out like a frog 's . Her crotch tilted and I would enter her suddenly . She 'd arch up , I 'd hold her belly with one hand from behind . I 'd try to turn her around , but she would n't face me . Her body moved faster and faster , bucking away . Then , it turned bad . I could n't stop it . She was still underneath with her back to me , her face into the cushions of the sofa , and I felt her sobbing . Flair covered her face . I reached to hook some behind her ear and look at her . I was not surprised that she would cry , but her sobs seemed desolate , profound . Her back and shoulders convulsed and it went on longer than it seemed it should have . Her sobs seemed voices from a ventriloquist , far away , abstract , unanswerable . I looked down at her , sleeping purely , her face bunched . I returned were climbing bare , dirty stairs , we passed doors covered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us each seemed to be missing something  --  one had no socks , another no hair . " A welfare hotel . " The Princess Kelly seemed stripped . Ceilings still held the height of a former life , Up three flights , Martha opened a door and we were in a room full of toys . Kids played at low tables and in a sandbox right there , Martha waved to people and led me to a tiny plastic chair . She installed me and gave me puzzles to work out with the kids at my table . She went to serve other kids their breakfast . I 'm not particularly good with kids . I want to be . But I 'm a little afraid of them . I 'm never sure what to say . These kids crowded around , because I was new I guess , pressing close so I smelled crumbs on their breath . They looked at me as if I was supposed to do something . " I 'm Charlie . What 're your names ! " There was a boy named Mohammed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dior . I put the puzzles before us on the table and thank goodness they began to play by themselves . Between us we got one done , a puzzle of the United States , missing Indiana . I palmed Nebraska , planted it behind Mohammed 's ear . Next came Kansas for Tiffany 's sock . She was two octaves of giggle . I was beginning to feel better . I looked over at Martha . As she picked up a child and set him down in the indoor sandbox , I noticed a chip of lipstick on one of her front teeth . Then , I remembered a gesture of my parents . My father putting a finger to his mouth and moving his lips in a certain way meant my mother had lipstick on her teeth . She would immediately extract a tissue from her purse or he would hand over his hankie and she would repair the damage . She would look up to him in a question and he would nod , yes , got it , and smile . Sometimes it would go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd work more , look up . " There ? " At worst , he 'd come to her with his hankie , wipe it off himself , show it to her , finishing with a kiss . I saw this maybe a hundred times during childhood . It was as regular as many homely things that come to me , now , years after my parents are dead and in the ground . Their absence seems almost an abstraction . But that movement of my father 's lips , circled with vertical lines , told something different than my mother 's firm shake of a pan over the stove , say , something more , that had nothing to do with me . They were truly in love , aside from Barbara and me , in a way I 'd never been with any of those pretty , cheerful girls I 'd danced with and later petted in the cow pastures and ditches , in a timbre I 'd never had with Jody either , a good , decent , intelligent woman all the same . But my parents shared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky . I smiled to myself in a slight cruelty to Jody ; their marriage may have been as unequal as she 'd decided it was , but they were happy . Not everything they did and tried for was so beside the point . Their canasta and golf and my father 's dog imitations and his fox-trots , ray mother 's butter-filled cakes and prize relish . All the proof was in that one gesture . It told of their lives in bed , a handing back and forth , fluency . Jody and I talked about equality , we gossiped about the disrespect other men we knew showed their wives . I 'd done dishes , done laundry , in fact , picked up after Jody as long as I 'd known her . I did a lot in our marriage . And yet , none of those things had anything to do with real equality . They were arrangements . I felt Martha and I could be partners in the world , that she was the closest person to me . Love now seemed a form of sympathy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my cuff , wet it with saliva , and said , " Comeer . Open your mouth a second . " Martha told me the city paid $1,800 a month for families to live in rooms without bathrooms in the Princess Kelly . That was more than double what she paid for her apartment on the thirteenth floor . We shook our heads , bewildered that no one had yet succeeded in changing the Byzantine laws . Why could n't this money build decent houses for these families , houses with window boxes , cheerful stairways ! ed up the front steps , the briefcase still banging , opened the door shouting , " I 'm ho-ome . " But no one was there . Jody must have been in the basement office in McCosh , at the word processor . Or in the library or having a fervent talk over coffee with another older graduate student . I should be pleased with her excitement . She deserved it . The house was dim and still , the furniture upholstered and round , matched in shades of brown . I collapsed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dine out now and she enjoys the meals , eating every piece on her plate slowly , but we spent little during our early married life . She managed the money and scraped up enough for a down payment on this house . Jody is a very good-looking woman . But it seems she decided long ago that certain things would n't last and that those things did n't matter very much . And in a way she 's right . On clear cold early Saturday mornings I wake up here , and whether or not she could dance or would dance with me the night before , a satin gown and gloves , eye makeup , pool , magic , or even singing along to pop songs  --  none of those seem to count . Those mornings we clean the house together , then drive out to the country to a farm market , come home and make French toast out of fresh bread and new eggs . But I am a waster . Too many colorful , ephemeral things take my attention . I shot pool here the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

I could kind of fathom my father 's steps and my father 's gait and my father 's deepening frown . The goofiness went out of him when you talked morality . He would n't have known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line . I thought of him one time , standing at the foot of the stairs . " I 'm as loyal as a dog , " he said . His eyes cast over to our beagle , who was asleep , paws in front of him , under the dining-room table . " Eighteen years and I still shine my shoes for your mother . For a date with her . " He stopped just then when my mother stepped to the top of the banister , tall in heels , her neck and clavicle exposed , ears shiny with gold . He tossed use the car keys . He did n't care anymore . They were getting picked up by the Dweebles . He whistled whee-whew and watched her as she stepped down , saying , " Oh , George . " He was dead and in the ground . The wind blew branches and leaves , ticking , over their graves . I ran to Jody 's little study , off our kitchen . She had a word processor set up there , our first one , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were lined up on a shelf , labeled . In an open box , she had beige stationery with her name and our address , not printed but raised up on the paper . I ran my fingers over it . She had two pens in pen holders mounted on either side of a clock and a brown paisley blotter paper she 'd bought in a gift store . In a silver frame was a faded poster of Flint Central 's Anything Goes . I 'd seen Jody slip into shyness and awe on these campuses the way Flint and magic and pool had sunk to nothing in her first white-walled apartment , ringing with music . Probably everybody is like that . Anyone can look less somewhere else . And Jody was like Martha too . She 'd come here , east , with me . She wanted things . Idid n't know if I 'd see Martha there . When I looked up at her , it was like a rush of wings . It took time for me to slow enough to see her . Martha stuck out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ? " They were a strange tone , opaque , yet vaguely shimmery , smooth , reminiscent of actresses ' legs in old blackand-white movies . " They 're two . They 're just regular Hanes sheer , but two pair , one over the other . " She grinned . She still loved revealing her discoveries . " Ouch , " she said as the train lurched . She told me she 'd bitten the place she bit the week before , just when it was healing . " It 's bleeding . 1 have n't eaten meat for six years , but blood always tastes good to me . " The cut made Martha 's cheeks uneven , the left one swelling , and her shoot was on Saturday morning . I poked around the inside of her mouth with my finger and she nodded when I touched the place . I took out a hankie , dabbed until it came clean . I showed her the spot . Then I closed her mouth with my hand . She touched the ring on my finger . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . A lot of good we 've done . " Just then the bird began to flap and sing . The woman in the seat across from us must have taken the cover off the cage . And the bird  --  it was a parrot , yellow and jungle green with a red back  --  sang a wild half-shriek . " Ouch . It started again . Bleeding . " I looked in her bag for ... something . I had n't helped . Maybe something of hers would . I took out each item , laying each on the old velvet seat . There were small red-orange pots of cream , blue and green pencils , a dollar , pink and magenta lipsticks in gold cases , purple scallop-shaped compacts , a knotted rosary , a silver contraption for curling eyelashes , a gold can of mousse , and , at the bottom , one big yellow box of Argo cornstarch . The woman on the box was the same she 'd been all our childhood : an Indian squaw with hair parted down the middle , blush engraved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feather . Her long gown opened to show her body ; a full curved perfect ear of corn . " Martha ? You would have been my wife , " 1 said . She nodded . I held her chin with a cupped hand , impersonal and firm . Fora moment , I thought of the people around us ; how we must look . I smiled to myself . It would be impossible ever to explain . But her chin wavered in my palm , it was hurting . I dabbed a little cornstarch onto my fingertip to press on the cut . She opened her mouth , I looked inside , there was a round dark spot of blood on her tooth and everything narrowed to just that . ?
