The Mosaic set , almost by definition , captures many of shades of jazz . High seriousness is represented . Humor is all over it - there is a semi-scatological parody of Noel Coward ' s " Private Lives , " renamed " Private Jives , " by the saxophonist Bud Freeman . There are tracks that sum up jazz ' s day-drawing-to-a-close sense of melancholy . There are tracks that swing first , think later - party jazz . Made by both black and white musicians , the music , sophisticated or rambunctious , romantic or hardened , represents many of jazz ' s different meanings and uses . It shows how jazz , at least during the period the records were made , from 1938 to 1943 , was one of the few artistic idioms in American culture in which people of all races and classes were welcome to try making a living. // Though the music on Commodore is often brilliant , the label is important for more than just its music . For one , Commodore , started in 1938 by Milt Gabler , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz label . Mr. Gabler , in the late 20 ' s , slowly transformed a family radio store on 42d Street into a record store and a hangout for students , jazz musicians and reporters and editors from the nearby offices of Time magazine . Mr. Gabler made a point of stocking as many records as he could , encouraging the idea of collecting . By the mid-30 ' s he had hit upon an idea that would have profound ramifications and would allow a project like the present compilation to exist : He reissued some sides by the Wolverines from 1924 . It was the beginning of the first systematic jazz reissue program. // Not only did Mr. Gabler start a special label for the reissues , United Hot Clubs of America , but he put , also for the first time , the personnel on the labels of the records . With these two moves , Mr. Gabler pulled jazz one step further away from its image of simple entertainment and helped it become music regarded for its musical and cultural value . Its practitioners were no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musicians possessing individual personalities . Mr. Gabler is a beneficiary of his own inventions : the Commodore material has been reissued all over the world , many times. // Like any summation of a label , the Commodore set reflects the taste and talents of its owner . Mr. Gabler was one of the record industry ' s great producers and artist-and-repertoire men - his career extended well into the rock-and-roll era - and the uniform power of the music in the set underscores the importance of a producer . Mr. Gabler , who is now mostly retired from the record business , inevitably got the best out of his musicians - except for Dave Tough , the great drummer , who was so drunk during one session that he only finished two takes , which are included in the volume . Another time , he sent his drums , but didn ' t show up himself . Otherwise , Mr. Gabler ' s ability to make perfect sessions is astounding : in these 345 tracks , a good half of which are alternate takes , there ' s hardly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked to re-create the sound of the loose , roughhouse jam sessions he heard in clubs - included in the set is the experimental " A Good Man Is Hard to Find , " date by Eddie Condon that re-created a jam session on two 12-inch records , for a total of 17 volatile minutes of music . There are very few arranged sessions here ; most are loose , leaning heavily on improvisation . He picked the musicians , relying on the white Chicagoans - Bud Freeman , Pee Wee Russell , Condon - for many of his dates , as well as the greatest saxophonists of the time : Lester Young ( but on clarinet , another of Mr. Gabler ' s ideas ) , Coleman Hawkins , Chu Berry , Benny Carter . Mr. Gabler picked 80 percent of the material that was played. // Commodore records are also exceptionally well-recorded : Mr. Gabler would work on the sound of the records himself , not leaving the placement of microphones to the recording engineer . And importantly , he wasn ' t scared of taking chances commercially : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were commercial flops when first released , is a tribute to his fearlessness. // The best sessions in the set are legendary . Lester Young ' s Kansas City Six session produced some of the best improvising in American music . Chu Berry ' s 1938 session , featuring the trumpeter Roy Eldridge , includes the proto-bop pianist Clyde Hart , and it had romantically interpreted tunes such as " Stardust " and " Body and Soul " that opened the way for the swaggering and lush interpretation of ballads ; a later date includes the lovely " Gee Baby Ain ' t I Good to You , " sung by Oran " Hot Lips " Page. // Coleman Hawkins ' s Chocolate Dandies session , from 1940 , with Roy Eldridge and Benny Carter , is loaded with masterpieces , and it includes an uncharacteristic six takes of " Smack , " which show how the tune evolved to one perfect take . ( Most Commodore sessions only have one or two alternates . ) Billie Holiday ' s " Strange Fruit , " an intense meditation on lynching , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her first session for Commodore. // But the most exciting thing about the set is its resuscitation of a series of undeservedly forgotten musicians - the pianists Joe Bushkin , Joe Sullivan and the exceptional Jess Stacy put in wonderful time here - and it brings back into circulation odd little snippets of music and rare jazz masterpieces that add detail to jazz ' s mosaic . A Jess Stacy duet with Bud Freeman sparkles ; fans of the great eccentric clarinetist Pee Wee Russell will have a total of 85 titles to wallow in , including Russell ' s Three Deuces session , featuring Zutty Singleton on drums and Joe Sullivan on piano. // One of many special sessions is the 1939 solo date by Willie " The Lion " Smith , the great New York pianist . By 1939 , Smith ' s playing was hardly innovative , and again Mr. Gabler ' s imagination and skill in the studio pay off : not only are these 14 solos some of the best music Smith recorded , but they ' re gorgeous , a complicated amalgamation of stride piano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , all imbued with a graceful , easy swing . Though they must have sounded archaic when they were released , today they sound utterly fresh and timeless . His own compositions - " Morning Air , " " Echoes of Spring " - are full of jewel-like melodies and double-time spurts , all delicate but played with an unwavering , persistent rhythm . The session is unlike anything else on the label , which makes it fit right in. //
