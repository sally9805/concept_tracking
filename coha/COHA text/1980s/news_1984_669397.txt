He is resting from his labors , sprawled out on a couch in his trailer dressing room . Hanks is the star of a spy spoof being shot in Washington , a movie tentatively titled ' ' The Man With One Red Shoe. ' ' // Hanks is also the ingenuous-looking young man with curly brown hair who fell sweetly and obsessively in love with a mermaid in the Walt Disney hit ' ' Splash . ' ' Comedy is his forte , as he proved in ' ' Splash ' ' and in his other hit , the R-rated ' ' Bachelor Party . ' ' Hanks believes there ' s always a need for comedy , even when people are worried about nuclear winter or war in Central America : // ' ' All through history this has been the case , from the Greeks on . . . sooner or later everybody wants that sort of relief . It ' s like sleep . You can ' t live without it . Certainly during the depression that was the case , ' ' he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedies ' ' from that era. // Hanks may be a shooting star , one of the hottest young actors in America today , but the subject bores him . Fame ? He doesn ' t want to talk about it except to say ' ' Yes , the calendar pages flew by and bang , here I am . It all happened that fast . ' ' Right after his big ' ' Splash ' ' Hanks was tapped for the starring role of the bridegroom in the raunchy sex comedy ' ' Bachelor Party . ' ' He shrugs off the role , saying , ' ' It was an opportunity to be an iconoclast down the line , ' ' and he says he chose it because the film was so different from ' ' Splash. ' ' // Variety in his roles is what interests him now , says Hanks , who chose this spy caper for another reason that ' s important to him as an actor : fun . ' ' As far as the making of these things is concerned , there ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no fun . I have a tendency to play quite a bit , I want to have a good time . And I think that ( fun ) bleeds through on the screen in really good comedies . I can ' t believe Cary Grant didn ' t have a great time doing some of his movies , or James Stewart , and I ' m sure the Marx Brothers did a lot of laughing. ' ' // Well , perhaps not every moment on the set is rollicking fun . Hanks had spent part of one torridly steamy afternoon in Georgetown , where many scenes were filmed , opening the front door of a red brick house and wheeling a bicycle down the steps for endless takes . And bumping the bicycle over quaint cobblestoned streets in hot pursuit of a car which had kidnapped the heroine ( Lori Singer ) . But on the day of this interview , in addition to pumping up that bicycle tire , he got ready for a scene with Dabney Coleman , Jim Belushi , Edward Hermann , and Lori Singer . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour agency decked out in red , white and blue decor as patriotic looking as campaign bunting . The tour office is a CIA cover , with spys camouflaged as office personnel and tourists . In this scene dastardly Dabney Coleman as the head spook is breathing menace all over Tom Hanks , who is pursuing gorgeous blond spy Lori Singer. // Hanks is dressed in the sweats he was wearing in his trailer : a royal blue sweat shirt with the words Chair 1 printed on white on the back , a pair of grungy blue sweat pants , once-white running shoes , and a red baseball cap with a treble clef emblazoned on it . It ' s exactly what a concert violinist belonging to a symphony baseball team would wear . The character he plays , Richard Drew , is a young violinist , a former child prodigy mistaken for a spy . It is a switch from the role Pierre Richard made famous in the French souffle of a comedy ' ' The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe , ' ' which inspired this new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drai , is currently mining the gold of successful French films like that one and another Yves Robert film on which he has based the current Gene Wilder comedy ' ' The Woman in Red . ' ' Drai , wearing red and white high-top sneakers , faded blue jeans , and a white shirt , stands on the sidelines while the scene is rehearsed . Hanks is right in the middle of beguiling the blond spy into talking with him when director Stan ( Mr. Mom ) Dragoti decides to close the set and shoos everyone out. // During our interview , Hanks talked a bit about the violinist he plays . The character , Hanks says solemnly , ' ' has tunnel vision . Unless he is focused on this one thing , music , he has the attention span of a lower life form . ' ' Hanks says the violinist goes through life listening only to the music in his head and oblivious to the havoc that erupts around him as a massive spy operation pursues him . Does Hanks play the violin ? ' ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grin . After one and a half months of lessons with a violinist from Twentieth Century Fox ' s music department , Hanks says he can play a section of Rimsky-Korsakov ' s ' ' Scheherezade , ' ' ' ' Love Me Tender , ' ' and the theme from ' ' Father Knows Best. ' ' // With or without pizzicato , the role of a concert violinist is a change of pace for the young actor who broke into show biz in a TV sitcom , ' ' Bosom Buddies , ' ' and first surfaced as a star in ' ' Splash . ' ' In ' ' Splash ' ' Hanks brought an endearing zaniness to the role of the smitten lover who didn ' t care whether his girl had gills or not . ' ' The guy was a potato , he was a lox , ' ' sighs Hanks , ' ' and that ' s what I was trying to portray , a swept-away character . If he hadn ' t met this girl , he would have ended up in 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who doesn ' t even come alive for the baseball season . ' ' As he talks , Hanks snaps the blue sweatbands on his wrists like slingshots. // It was Hanks who pointed out to producer Victor Drai that since he was neither tall nor blond the original film title , ' ' The Tall Blond Man With One Black Shoe , ' ' wouldn ' t work . ' ' The Man With One Black Shoe ' ' sounded flat , so when a member of the crew suggested ' ' one red shoe ' ' for color that became the working title. // Hanks is wearing scruffy brown and tan saddle shoes a few days later when the gang of 100 or so involved in the film arrives on location in Georgetown at Blues Alley , a jazz nightclub . Blues Alley has been temporarily converted to a laundry with a ' ' Linens of the Week ' ' sign posted overhead in front of its laundry truck ; a Landmark Tours car carrying a kidnapped Lori Singer has just collided with the truck , spewing a rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to getting just the right take of Tom Hanks running up to the Landmark car , snatching Lori Singer to safety , and running off with her . When everything including the movie crane is in place , an assistant director yells ' ' Quiet please ! Roll tape ! Action ! ' ' and a few more seconds of the movie are shot . The next day it ' s back to Los Angeles where the rest of the film will be shot and intercut with footage like Hanks ' s bike ride down the Lincoln Monument steps. // For Tom Hanks , making movies is one long Landmark tour . He was raised by his divorced father in Oakland , Calif. , had his first role in a school production of Tennessee Williams ' s ' ' The Night of the Iguana , ' ' then ricocheted off to college . He wanted to study stage carpentry but ended up in front of the lights , acting for three seasons in the Great Lakes Shakespeare Festival in Cleveland , then went on to New York for what he remembers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the movie ' ' Mazes and Monsters . ' ' ABC spotted him in that and flew him to L.A. to test for ' ' Bosom Buddies , ' ' which landed him fame and a two-year contract . Hanks is reluctant for reasons of privacy to talk about his producer wife and their two young children , but he ' ll tell you about shooting a TV sitcom : // It was fun , he admits , but ' ' after a while it just beats you to a pulp , the physicality of it . ' ' He prefers movies like this one or his next , ' ' The Volunteers , ' ' a film about the Peace Corps in 1962 to be shot near Vera Cruz in Mexico . ' ' When you make a movie , you get to go somewhere - Vera Cruz , Washington , Toronto , Europe , LAX ( Los Angeles Airport ) . I ' ve been all over making movies . When you do TV , you get to go to Studio 25 at Paramount , ' ' says Hanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes. // //
