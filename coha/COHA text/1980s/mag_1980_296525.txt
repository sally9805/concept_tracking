Jesse Owens : 1913-1980 <P> He was a superlative athlete , but that was almost incidental to the role he came to play in history . He happened to be black , and his timing was perfect . Thus James Cleveland ( " Jesse " ) Owens became forever a symbol of the triumph of the individual over man 's more malevolent impulses . At the 1936 Olympics in Berlin , which Adolf Hitler hoped would be a showcase of Aryan supremacy , Owens won four gold medals in track and field events , a feat not equaled since . The sight of the graceful American 's soaring victory in the long jump and his Olympic-record wins in the 100-and 200-meter dashes and 400-meter relay put the lie to der Fhrer 's simplistic myths about race . <P> With international conflict clouding the Games once again , Owens ' feat takes on a special resonance . In 1936 many voices called for a boycott of the Berlin Olympics to protest the policies of the host nation , as President Carter has done in the case of the 1980 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own belief that the Olympics should not be suborned by politics , it was , of course , played as a political triumph by the foes of Nazism . Almost forgotten is the fact that two Jewish sprinters who had qualified for the U.S. 400-meter relay team were not allowed to compete . And as Owens later noted , " When I came back to my native country , I could n't ride in the front of the bus . I had to go in the back door . I could n't live where I wanted . Now what 's the difference ? " <P> On the field , the difference was his skill . At a meet a year before the Games , while a student at Ohio State , he broke three world marks and tied another in just 45 minutes of competition . His times in the 100- and 200-meter dashes in Berlin still would have won Olympic medals as late as 1964 . <P> The son of an Alabama tenant farmer , Owens was a schoolboy track star in Cleveland . He worked his way through Ohio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic triumphs pursued a variety of jobs : disc jockey , bandleader , salesman . A forceful speaker , he eventually prospered as a lecturer and headed his own Phoenix public relations firm . Until he entered the hospital in December , stricken by the lung cancer that killed him last week at the age of 66 , he was , appropriately , serving as the State Department 's " Ambassador to Sports .
