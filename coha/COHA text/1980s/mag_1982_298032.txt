GREGORY 'S GIRL Directed and Written by Bill Forsyth <P> He is all haircut , tangled legs and misinformation . Most of his energy is devoted to coping with his own sudden , if spindly , growth . But there is some left over for trying to puzzle out the world 's mysteries in general , the odd otherness of the opposite sex in particular . He does not smoke pot , play bad music too loudly , or greatly imperil his own or anybody else 's virginity . In short , Gregory ( Gordon John Sinclair ) is what one used to think of as a typical teen-age boy back in the days when adolescence was a goofy phase that adults could afford to indulge instead of a time bomb that needs to be defused . Gregory 's Girl seems to exist in some Brigadoon of the mind , where psychologists and sociologists are unnecessary and probably unheard of . Indeed , the setting is a far-off corner of Scotland , in a government-sponsored " new town , " which supports a livelier life in its interstices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the appeal of Gregory 's Girl than wistfulness for the kind of adolescence no one seems to enjoy any more . Writer-Director Bill Forsyth , working inexpensively on his native heath , is not one to confront life headlong and headon . He is a jogger not a sprinter , a man content to chug amiably along observing the world through a series of sidelong glances instead of driving single-mindedly toward a narrow goal . <P> Take the relationship the title seems to promise ; it never becomes a relationship at all . Gregory starts mooning after Dorothy ( Dee Hepburn ) when she beats him out of his position on the boys ' soccer team at school . A liberated lady , she throws him into total confusion by accepting his first offer of a date , then does him the favor of standing him up . Three of her pals take him over , passing him along from one to the next over the course of an evening . He ends up on a hillside with Susan ( Clare Grogan ) , who likes him best and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is just the right speed for him . It is an opinion he comes to agree with gratefully . <P> Ensuring that his hero gets squared off and paired up is not the only thing on Forsyth 's mind . He has a genial taste for mild eccentrics and sees to it that plenty of them wander in and out of Gregory 's life . There is a friend who is overstuffed with useless facts ( " Did you know when you sneeze it comes out of your nose at 160 miles per hour ? " he inquires of a girl he 's trying to impress ) , a headmaster who encourages a student 's underground traffic in exotic pastry because he has an unmanageable sweet tooth , a ten-year-old sister , precociously wise in the ways of the world , who gives Gregory such good advice as he gets on how to conduct his life . There is even a penguin - or rather , some one dressed up in a penguin suit - who in explicably wanders the school 's corridor , collecting misdirections on where he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still looking for his roost . <P> There are no big meanings here ; no big laughs , for that matter , either . Instead , there is a mild , but admirably stubborn singularity . Gregory 's Girl does not offer anything as thick as slice life , just slivers of it , cut thin as smoked Scotch salmon . And tasting just as sweet . - By Richard Schickel
