 | It starts with a slap on the bottom in the delivery room and , except for the occasional stuffy nose , continues almost unnoticed until we die . Breathing out and breathing in may be second nature to most of us ? but not for the more than 10 million Americans who suffer from asthma . For them , inhaling and exhaling normally is a recurring struggle , often magnified by anxiety and dependence on a battery of medications . A new , comprehensive survey released last week by Research &; Forecasts , Inc. , a public-opinion consulting firm , chronicles how asthmatics and their caregivers are dealing with the debilitating illness . Among the most important findings : doctors are seeing a dramatic increase in asthma patients ? and many parents report that the disease can have a devastating emotional impact on afflicted children . Asthma is a respiratory disease that can severely inhibit the ability to breathe . In those afflicted , the bronchi ? the tubes that carry air into and out of the lungs ? seem to be hyperreactive to any of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold weather , infections , pollen , animal dander , house dust , cigarette smoke , cleaning products and emotional stress . During an attack , the bronchial tissue swells and constricts , and mucus accumulates , impairing the passage of air . Patients often feel tightness in the chest and begin wheezing . If the constriction is severe , they may experience the frightening sensation of being about to suffocate . The American Asthma Report , the largest of its kind , surveyed 500 adult asthmatics , 250 parents of asthmatic children , 100 school nurses , 109 pediatricians and 204 other physicians , including allergists and lung specialists . While the research , gathered through telephone interviews , is not scientific , " it does put a face on the problem , " says Frank Walton , president of Research &; Forecasts . Almost half the doctors said they see more asthma patients in their practice today than they did five or 10 years ago ; of the pediatricians , 27 percent reported seeing more than 10 children with asthma each week . The reason most frequently cited by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution , which produces a wide range of allergic and respiratory problems . Pollution was also blamed for the rise in asthma-related deaths , which grew 23 percent between 1980 and 1985 . Other explanations for the death toll included misdiagnosis and misuse of medications ? both too much and too little . About 7 percent of all American children have asthma ; it is most common among male , black and urban youngsters . According to the National Center for Health Statistics , asthma cases among children 6 to 11 years old increased 58 percent during the 1970s . More recently , among Americans under 18 suffering from chronic respiratory problems , the diagnosis of asthma increased from 33 percent in 1982 to 52 percent in 1987 . Kids , the new survey revealed , have a rougher time with the disease than adults . During 1988 almost half the children of the parents surveyed were taken to the emergency room with an asthma attack . Three quarters of the children missed school . By contrast , only 15 percent of the asthmatic adults visited hospital emergency rooms and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no question that children who suffer from asthma also suffer the psychological consequences of having a debilitating illness . However , researchers emphasize that asthma is not caused by emotional @#  | problems . " There is a great deal of folklore about asthma being psychological in origin , because the symptoms are so responsive to the patient 's emotional state , " says child psychologist Lee Salk . " It is definitely and clearly a physiological problem with many psychosocial implications . " According to The American Asthma Report , both asthmatic children and their parents have emotional concerns about the disease . Fortyone percent of the asthmatic children expressed fears and anxieties to their parents . Almost half the kids felt socially restricted , perceived themselves as " different " from other kids , felt more self-conscious and were embarrassed by having to take medication . Asthma often strikes at night , and the children who experienced nocturnal attacks were particularly likely to be adversely affected emotionally . Parents worry about how safe their children will be in school . " School means that you must trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Nancy Sander , whose 10-yearold daughter Brooke is severely asthmatic . In 1985 Sander founded Mothers of Asthmatics , Inc. , a support network that helps parents cope and encourages their children to enjoy active lives . Concerns about school are sometimes well founded ; 54 percent of the nurses surveyed said their schools did n't allow children to keep pocket-size inhalers handy but required them to park the devices in the nurses ' office . The reason : the schools feared that other children might try the inhalers and be harmed . Good sports : While only one in three adults surveyed said asthma cramped their style , 82 percent of the parents interviewed said the disease placed restrictions on some of their children 's activities , especially staying overnight at a friend 's house and playing sports . In the past asthmatics were often told not to exercise much , but most physicians now believe regular , moderate physical activity can actually help patients breathe easier . Indeed , a number of prominent athletes have triumphed despite chronic asthma , including Olympic champions Nancy Hogshead and Jackie Joyner-Kersee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American Asthma Report believe the lives of asthma sufferers are less restricted by their disease than they were 10 years ago . In the decade to come , with improved medications and public awareness , it seems likely that more and more asthmatics will achieve their personal best . @# NEWSWEEK : SEPTEMBER 4 , 1989 61
