Gambrel ' thinks it does , but all the patients I have on estrogen are also on progesterone because I would n't keep them on estrogen without it , and so I think it may be protective . " We asked Dr. Howard Fillit , a gerontologist at Rockefeller University , about Pat Saylor 's question as to whether testosterone would help her libido . " Well that 's a very interesting question . " he said . " A study in 1986 by Barbara Sherwin showed that testosterone does affect libido in women who have undergone a surgical menopause as Ms. Saylor has . And the interesting thing about it is that the brain cells , even in women , may respond to testosterone . There is data , even in the recent literature , by some very well-respected scientists in this field in exactly the kind of situation that this lady is in , which is the surgical menopause , showing that testosterone actually may be better than estrogen in increasing libido . Again , it 's a research question more than a clinical question . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be willing to give a menopausal woman testosterone , and I would recommend that she first get on adequate doses of estradiol by using the patch and then see how she feels . " He went on to explain that the Ogen that Mrs. Saylor takes is a natural estrogenic substance , but it 's not estradiol . " In postmenopausal women , " Dr. Fillit said , " they lose most of their estradiol , and the predominant form of estrogen becomes estrone sulfate , which is much less active as an estrogen compound and estrogenic hormone . And what she 's taking in the Ogen is estrone sulfate , so she 's not really taking estradiol at all , and she would need higher doses . So there 's good reason to think that if she did switch to the patch she would get relief , and in fact , she 's quite right in saying that there 's no reason why she should n't be able to find relief . Probably the reason why she ca n't is because of the nature of the medication she 's taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I would definitely recommend her to switch over to the patch for relief , and I think she 's quite right . " Many other women have written letters that show they are confused about estrogen . Typical is this onefrom Gisela Whited : Dear Dr. SerVaas : I am 50 years old , had a hysterectomy with removal of ovaries about five years ago due to a large fibroid tumor ( benign ) . Right after surgery I received Premarin estrogen and felt quite well while being on it . After one year I stopped using it because I was afraid of breast cancer . As your article points out , maybe I reacted too prematurely . Well , anyway , I did not feel well during the I 1/2 years that I was off the Premarin . My bones felt as if they had weights on them and I had trouble with my joints , so I went on the Premarin again for a limited time because I worry about breast cancer . So , now I am without any estrogen therapy , and I do not feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason I am worried about breast cancer is that I have had a couple of cysts in my breasts . Biopsy and removal of the cysts showed they were benign . My question to you is : would the skin patch be alright for me , even though I have the tendency to develop cysts ? I understand that the reasoning now is that just because a woman develops cysts does not necessarily mean that she is more prone to breast cancer , is n't that right ? Those cysts would not be estrogen sensitive ( responsive ) the way some breast cancers are , would they ? .. Gratefully , Gisela Whited Jan. /Feb.117 Because the answers to Ms. Whited 's questions are quite complex , we 're forwarding her letter to Dr. Nachtigall for reply . In reviewing Dr. Nachtigall 's new book . Estrogen : The Facts Can Change Your Life , I found an excellent excerpt entitled , " Do You Need a Gynecologist ? " : " Every woman , especially after 40 , should have a complete pelvic examination at least once a year and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hormone replacement . Many generalists and internists consider the female reproductive system part of their bailiwick and routinely do all their own pelvic exams . If they run into a question or a problem they ca n't handle , they will ( or should ) send you to a gynecologist who is a specialist in the female reproductive processes . " This is perfectly legitimate , to my mind , though I believe that specialists are always best when anything out of the ordinary is taking place in your body . A gynecologist sees many more cases of vaginal infections , delivers more babies , has dealt with more women at menopause , is more knowledgeable about estrogen replacement therapy , and is more likely to have kept up with the most recent developments in the field than an internist . " In most cases , it would be ideal for you to have a general doctor and a gynecologist . You should see the internist or family doctor once a year for a complete checkup and the specialist at least once a year for a pelvic examination , whether or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not forget the reproductive endocrinologists , like myself , who specialize in women 's glands and the hormones they secrete . The endocrinologist has always trained first as an internist or gynecologist before going on to this more sophisticated field .

If you are having great difficulties , if there are questions about whether or not you should have hormone therapy , if there are doubts about how the thercontinued on page 100 WHY DID MY SISTER GET LUNG CANCER ? p rimary cancer in the lungs of nonsmokers is extremely rare . For this reason , we were shocked and incredulous when my sister , Dorothy , was given the diagnosis of bronchogenic adenocarcinoma . She had never smoked in her life , she had never lived with smokers , she had never even been exposed to smokers . Having lived in rural Iowa on a farm near a small town , she had never been exposed to any known pollutant . After the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we began making inquiries about possible causes of lung cancer in nonsmokers . Of the 160,000 deaths from lung cancer each year , most are caused by smoking , either by the victim himself or by those around him . The affliction is rarely found in people who have had no association with tobacco . We began searching for the possible cause of my sister 's lung cancer . She had the upper left lobe of her lung removed . If we could just find what caused the cancer to develop there , perhaps we could prevent a recurrence in her remaining lobes . If Dorothy has been doing something or breathing something that caused the lung cancer to develop , we would certainly want to find out what it is . The Centers for Disease Control tells us that at present radon is the largest single cause of lung cancer in nonsmokers . The CDC has been frequently quoted as saying that this naturally occurring radioactive gas may be responsible for 5,000 to 20,000 lung-cancer deaths per year in the United States . I believe these figures , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also smoked . Radon trapped in cigarettes has long been a concern . It is known that smoking and radon exposure is worse than additive  --  it compounds the harm . Radon rises from the ground in varying amounts in most parts of the country . It is harmless outdoors , but when it accumulates in high concentrations inside a house , exposure to it over long periods may be lethal . Dorothy 's family hung a charcoal-bag radon detector in her basement for three days , and the radon level tested at 8.3 picocuries per liter , more than twice the level the Environmental Protection Agency has set as the action level  --  at 4.0 picocuries per liter or greater , the EPA recommends that steps be taken to reduce the amount of radon gas entering the home . Further testing will be necessary to determine the extent of the problem in Dorothy 's home , but in the meantime , her family is investigating ways of lowering the radon level . Radon usually enters from the soil , so basements and crawl spaces exposed to open earth usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside a house draws gas out of the soil ; it seeps in through cracks and openings and is pulled up into the higher parts of the home . Several features of Dorothy 's basement make it susceptible to radon problems : cracks in the concrete slab , hollow-block walls , a sump pump , and a wood-burning stove . The cracks in the floor can be sealed with silicone caulking , as can the joints between the floor and walls and open- Prostate Manograms on the MaleMobile After attending a seminar about transrectal ultrasound for early prostate cancer detection , I took my husband to Methodist Hospital in Indianapolis , where the equipment , newly approved by the FDA , was being demonstrated after the seminar . We were thankful that no nodules could be found in his prostate . My husband joins me in urging all male readers over 40 to have an exam soon , if they have not already done so . Wives : You can help save your husbands ' lives by making sure they have a prostate check . If your local hospital does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostate , ask your doctor to help you make some inquiries next time you go on vacation to an area that might  --  we believe it 's important to find a hospital that does this exam . One of the most exciting aspects of this equipment is that it makes a videotape of the prostate exam . This permanent record can then be mailed to experts at major research centers if the local radiologist has any doubts about a possible need for a biopsy . This exam is certainly not a replacement for the traditional digital rectal exam that is done by feeling for nodules in the prostate gland , much as a breast examiner searches for lumps . With a gloved finger , a physician can pick up small , palpable cancers because many of them are near the periphery of the gland and just outside the wall of the rectum . But ultrasound equipment has the potential of picking up very small cancers before they can be felt  --  much as the mammogram does for the breast . There is no radiation involved , and my husband reported that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before the probe is inserted , it is covered with a rubber balloon filled with water . The nice thing about the newly approved General Electric bi-plane equipment is that the probe needs to be inserted only once . Previously , two probes were used : one for the transverse view and one for the longitudinal view . Early detection is vital to survival for men with prostate cancer , the second most common form of cancer found in males and the third largest killer . Yet the results of a SotEvePost cancer prevention survey revealed that 62 percent of the men responding who were over 50 had not had a rectal exam in the past year . Even worse , one out of three had never had a rectal exam . An Ohio study revealed that 90 percent of primary-care physicians stated they do prostate screening as part of an annual physical . Yet only 41 percent of those same doctors reported that they do prostate screening when the men seek attention for an unrelated , specific complaint .
