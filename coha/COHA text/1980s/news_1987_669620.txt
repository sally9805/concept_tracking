After years of allowing the pirating of American movies , books , and audio tapes , the ' ' four tigers ' ' of Asia - Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan , and Hong Kong - are yielding to pressure from the United States to honor and enforce American copyrights. // Japan , long a haven for pirates , conducted 33 raids of illicit businesses in the first six months of the year . And other Asian nations that still allow pirates to flourish are under increasing pressure to stop the practice . ( US warns South Korea about import barriers , Page 5. ) // // This shift could mean millions of dollars in extra sales of US goods to countries that are running large trade surpluses with the US . Already , American book publishers report that sales this year are up 400 percent in Taiwan and Singapore . Sales of legitimate videotapes now make up 60 percent of the Japanese market - a substantial improvement over past years . Illegal audio cassettes have been virtually cleared from the streets of Singapore , where three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total market. // This reversal is welcome news to the US business community , which has complained about pirating for years . ' ' We are getting encouraging news in response to the complaints of US business ' ' says Charles Valentine , a trade specialist with the accounting firm of Arthur Young. // It is also good news for the US government , which would like to see intellectual property protection added to the trade rules covered by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. // There have been some major advances in the copyright laws of Asian nations , agrees Clayton Yeutter , the US trade representative . But Mr. Yeutter adds , ' ' It ' s an open question on their effectiveness. ' ' // The changes are taking place even as Congress is tackling the issue in the trade bill . In a measure supported by both parties , Congress proposes to let industries such as film and computer-software producers file quick-action trade complaints . The reason : Films , records , and computer programs have a short shelf life .

The US International Trade Commission , an arm of the Commerce Department , is completing a survey of 426 companies to determine losses to US business. // It is likely the report will find that while losses are declining , trade abuses are continuing . For example , US publishers charge that book pirates in South Korea used forthcoming changes in Korea ' s laws as a marketing tool . ' ' They told buyers to purchase illegal books before the textbooks went up in price or were not available , ' ' reports Carol Risher , director of copyright and new technology at the Association of American Publishers. // The publishers say they believe the pirates unloaded half of the 2 million books pirated annually , costing US companies $15 million to $20 million .

Other Asian countries have picked up the illegal trade when their neighbors have stopped. // Piracy in South Korea has been endemic . Mr. Valentine of Arthur Young recalls that during a visit to Seoul he saw merchants who would sew ' ' any designer label you wanted ' ' into clothing or footwear . Fashion-conscious shoppers could buy counterfeit Cartier luggage , Rolex watches , and Pierre Cardin suits. // Still other Asian countries have picked up the illegal trade when their neighbors have stopped . ' ' Cleaning up Singapore has led to problems in Indonesia , ' ' complains Jason Berman , executive director of the Recording Industry Association. // The International Federation of Phonogram and Videogram Producers in London estimates 80 percent of the cassettes bought in Thailand in 1986 were pirated , up from 55 percent in ' 84 . The organization estimates piracy represents nearly the entire market in Indonesia and 87 percent of the Malaysian business. // The pirates go to extremes to protect their turf .

' ' There is a heavy level of serious criminal involvement , ' ' says Molly Kellogg , antipiracy director at Warner Bros. // The pirates not only sell in the local markets but export movies as well . The usual route is through the Middle East and to Europe . ' ' We ' ve had recent US releases end up in Ireland with Chinese subtitles , ' ' Ms. Kellogg says . As for audio tapes , Mr. Berman says his office frequently finds pirated tapes at US flea markets. // Filched movies - usually action films - often are of low quality , since they are sometimes shot right off the screen . But the pirates are sophisticated marketeers , often reshooting films once they can get a better copy . ' ' I think they ' ve taken marketing courses at UCLA , ' ' Kellogg complains. // In Taiwan , piracy has also become more sophisticated . The Taiwanese have set up about 1 , 000 ' ' public performance centers ' ' in the past eight months . The Taiwanese owners say they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals can invite their friends in to watch movies . But money changes hands , and the shops include viewing booths that can seat up to a dozen people at a time . Recently , industry executives say , a 120-seat viewing center opened , showing pirated videotapes of first-run movies on a 200-inch video projection screen . ' ' It ' s eroding the traditional cinema , ' ' complains William Nix , vice-president of antipiracy at the Motion Picture Association , ' ' and we are very much up in arms over that. ' ' // To try to counter the pirates , the association has begun an antipiracy foundation that will include local lawyers , investigators with police backgrounds , and local distributors . They will work with the Taiwanese government to make sure the local laws are enforced. // Despite these problems , US businessmen are pleased to see some progress , especially in enforcement .
