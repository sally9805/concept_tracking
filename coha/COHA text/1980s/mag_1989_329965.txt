About 300 million Indians went to the polls last week , but they were not cheering for Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi the way they did when he ran in 1984 , two months after the assassination of his mother Indira . Surveys showed that the five-party National Front coalition , led by the mild , bespectacled V.P. Singh , stood a good chance of beating Gandhi 's Congress ( I ) Party . Since independence , Congress has been defeated only once . <P> Charges of corruption have been the opposition 's strongest electoral weapon , particularly allegations that officials in Gandhi 's government accepted some $50 million in kickbacks from the Swedish arms manufacturer AB Bofors . But Gandhi has also been derided for indecisive leadership , remoteness , inept campaign slogans , rising prices and , especially in rural areas , failing to deliver a better life . Yet Congress has scored points by painting the opposition coalition as inherently unstable . <P> Despite the deployment of more than 1.2 million police and paramilitary troops , almost 100 people were killed last week in election-related violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gandhi 's own constituency , as Congress used its great wealth , muscle and control over patronage to boost its chances of winning .
