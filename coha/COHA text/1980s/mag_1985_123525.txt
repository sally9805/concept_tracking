As its name indicates , Death Valley is not a congenial place . In the summer , temperatures frequently exceed 110 in the shade ; ground temperatures of 190 are not uncommon . // In July 1966 , Frenchman Jean-Pierre Marquant became the first person to complete a crossing of Death Valley on foot . Marquant 's 102-mile trek was actually a circular route that included part of the valley floor and the Panamint Mountains to the west . By the end of his nine-day ordeal , Marquant was semidelirious. // Two years later , Australian long-distance runner Bill Emmerton became the first person to run the length of Death Valley , completing a 134-mile course in just over three days . Exhibiting a bit more sense than Marquant , Emmerton chose the relatively " cool " month of April for his feat . Still , his trip was not easy ; near the end , he had to cut the front out of one shoe to allow the blood to flow freely from his torn and blistered foot . Convinced his first jaunt had n't been tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , extending his distance to 211 miles . // Given the course 's obvious drawbacks , it 's surprising that in 1970 , barely two years after Emmerton 's second run , someone came up with the idea of a competitive race across Death Valley . On the other hand , given the event 's initiator , maybe it 's not so surprising . Ken Crutchlow , 41 , is a British adventurer whose feats have included a hitchhiking race around the world ( during which he stowed away first-class on the German liner Bremen from New York to London ) , a bicycle marathon from Los Angeles to Mexico City , and a bicycle relay race in which he and a partner beat a freighter traveling from San Francisco to Ketchikan , Alaska . // Crutchlow was hanging out one day with John Fairfax , a fellow Englishman who in 1969 had become the first person to row across the Atlantic alone . " During the course of the trip , " says Crutchlow , " John had killed a shark using only a knife , and after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Yea , though I walk through the valley of death , I will fear no evil , for I am the biggest s.o.b . in the valley . ' Well , one time I said , ' What 's the point of walking through Death Valley ? You might as well run . ' And he said , ' I 'd like to see you run across Death Valley . ' So I said , ' No problem . I bet you a pint of beer I can do it . ' At the time I did n't even know where Death Valley was . " // Fairfax was willing to bet a beer but was not interested in running in the race himself , so Crutchlow set about finding someone else to compete against . He headed for San Francisco , where he issued an open challenge through the Bay Area newspapers . Enter Bruce Maxwell , a former University of Wisconsin varsity tennis player , whose distance-running career consisted of completing the 1969 Boston Marathon to collect on a $5 bet . // Maxwell took up the gage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a race across Death Valley . Says Maxwell , 37 , " In retrospect , it was complete idiocy . We were trying to make the race tough without having any idea of what the conditions were like . " // The first , and most important , rule to Crutchlow and Maxwell was that the race be held in August  --  the hottest month  --  and that all running be done between 6 a.m. and 8 p.m.  --  the hottest hours . Explains Crutchlow , " You want the satisfaction of being able to say that you crossed the hottest place on earth , and you do n't want someone to be able to diminish your achievement by saying , ' Oh , yeah , but you ran it at night . ' " ( Marquant and Emmerton had done most of their running during the evening hours. ) // The other rules were : // The runners would stop at 8 p.m. and camp for the night . // None of the vehicles connected with the runners or their support crews could have air conditioning . // The runners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times  --  no shortcutting across the desert . // The course would be the one Bill Emmerton followed on his first run : beginning in Shoshone , southeast of the valley , proceeding north on Highway 127 for 1.6 miles , west on Highway 178 over 3,315-foot Salsberry Pass and down into Death Valley , north to Badwater and Furnace Creek and up 3,000 feet to Scotty 's Castle  --  134 miles in all . // Maxwell 's training consisted of running five miles a day around Oakland 's Lake Merritt , playing handball and doing push-ups and sit-ups in a sauna . " A few days before the race , I went to L.A. to try to get used to the heat a little more , " he says , " but I had no idea what I 'd gotten into . I began to get an inkling when one of my support crew wondered if he could take his dog along with us . I called the park rangers in Death Valley , who said , ' Do not bring the dog  --  the dog will be dead within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspect it was n't going to be like running around Lake Merritt. " // Crutchlow was sponsored by Clarks , the British shoe company whose " desert boots " he would be wearing for part of the run ; Maxwell was backed by Levi Strauss . The publicity departments of the two companies went to work , and the Bay Area media jumped on the story . The ensuing publicity alarmed the rangers who keep an eye on the 2,981 square miles of Death Valley National Monument , part of the federal park system . Citing a law that forbids sporting events in national parks and monuments , the rangers put a damper on the event . // Finally , a compromise was negotiated : The runners would start their race 48 hours apart , thereby reducing the media crunch . A coin flip determined that Crutchlow would go first , and on Aug. 4 he set out from Shoshone . Ever the dapper Englishman , he began the race , as he does virtually all his athletic endeavors , in a natty pin-striped suit and bowler , and with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the media , Crutchlow changed into running clothes . // " It was a tremendous advantage to go second , " says Maxwell . " Part of the agreement was that we were n't supposed to know where the other one was  --  none of my people could go ahead , and none of them did . But the rangers were going back and forth , and I ended up hearing where Crutchlow was . " One thing Maxwell heard was that the Englishman had missed the turnoff to Salsberry Pass and lost three hours backtracking. // Buoyed by this news , Maxwell started out much too fast . " I virtually sprinted the first 14 miles , and heading up to the top of Salsberry Pass I was so sick to my stomach , I was hoping a rattlesnake would bite me so I could quit gracefully  --  and I had n't even dropped into Death Valley yet ! " Maxwell forced himself to go on , adopting a strategy whereby his support vehicle would go ahead half a mile and stop , giving him the security of knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( He estimates that he drank between four and five gallons a day. ) // Crutchlow , meanwhile , was experiencing similar difficulties . " The obvious thought that always comes to mind is , ' Why am I doing this ? ' I 've asked myself that question many times under many circumstances and , frankly , I 've never really found a satisfactory answer . But you have to convince yourself that no matter what , you 'll never quit . If you quit once , you 'll likely do it again . It 's just a question of mind over matter . As long as you 're putting one foot in front of the other , you 're making progress . " // When Maxwell reached Badwater at midafternoon of the second day , the soles of his running shoes had melted . Winds of 30 to 40 miles per hour had singed his skin , and he passed out . At the same time , one of the two men in his support crew became violently ill and had to be evacuated to a refrigerated room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Although nearly four hours of running time remained , it appeared that the American was through for the day . As he lay on the ground , a car drove up . " Now , you have to understand that nobody drives through Death Valley in the summer , " Maxwell says . " And out of nowhere , here is a German guy who is looking for Las Vegas ! And it just so happens that he 's a masseur ! Well , he worked on my legs for about an hour . Then he drove away  --  disappeared . Except for the rangers , he was the only other person we saw the whole time . Anyway , after the massage , I was ready to go again . " // By the next night , Maxwell had the race well in hand . " It was obvious by then that I was going to win . Crutchlow had finished , and he drove back that night and found our camp . And we both knew that if I finished , I 'd win . " // Maxwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hours faster than Crutchlow . " I had no sense of joy about winning , " says Maxwell . " Mostly I felt relief and a tremendous respect for Crutchlow. " // After the race , the two men went their separate ways , but in 1976 , upon returning to the Bay Area , Maxwell discovered that Crutchlow had been on the radio , asking for a rematch . Naturally , Maxwell agreed . // In the intervening time , each man had had his share of adventures , including another Death Valley escapade . In 1973 Crutchlow and a partner became the first to run , relay style , the 144 miles from the lowest point in the Western Hemisphere ( 282 feet below sea level , near Death Valley 's Badwater ) to the highest in the 48 contiguous states ( the 14,495-foot summit of California 's Mount Whitney ) . In 74 Maxwell and a partner completed the same run . // In ' 76 Maxwell was a tennis pro , a ski bum and also a serious runner ; Crutchlow was president of a marketing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vegas to sponsor the Death Valley rematch . // " As part of the publicity buildup for the second race , " says Maxwell , " they sent us to a physical fitness institute in L.A. , where we were thoroughly tested and examined by doctors . They concluded that I would win since I was in better shape . " // Maxwell 's chief concern was for his legs . During a seven-month period in 1975 , he had broken his left ankle and right leg in separate skiing accidents and rebroken the ankle playing football . After going stir-crazy in a cast following the first break , he refused to let the second and third fractures be set in casts . This race , he reasoned , would be a good test of his theories of self-healing. // This time the adversaries were allowed to race head-to-head through Death Valley ; otherwise , the rules were the same . On Aug. 23 , 1976 they set out , accompanied by a host of TV cameras . Maxwell opened up a small lead , which at first did n't concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman realized he had made a serious tactical error . " I do n't believe in making excuses , " he says now , " nor would I offer this as one . I give it to Bruce  --  he beat me fair and square . I think one of my big mistakes was following the advice of a friend , who is a very good competitive runner , to eat a lot of fruit , particularly bananas . I remembered that one of the problems I 'd had in Death Valley previously was that I did n't have any appetite . But he told me to eat enormous amounts of bloody bananas , and that was no good at all . They made me feel very heavy . My plan had been to run for 55 minutes and break for five , but I was always stopping early , with the idea of catching up later . Those five minutes kept dragging into 10 , and that 's where Bruce got away from me. " // As Maxwell steadily increased the distance between himself and Crutchlow , he found himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe he was holding back , waiting for me to burn out . " Putting those doubts out of his mind , Maxwell never looked back , and he continued to stretch his lead throughout the day . // At 3:30 Crutchlow became ill and vomited . By 4:30 he was finished for the day . Maxwell kept forcing his pace , and by 8 p.m. he had done 55 miles and held a commanding 17-mile lead . // The next morning , Crutchlow had recovered , but Maxwell maintained his edge . By the time he reached Furnace Creek , however , his right leg was badly swollen and discolored below the knee . He decided to sit down and rest for an hour . When he got up to continue , his right leg would n't bend , and he could n't walk , much less run . So he hobbled , stiff-legged , for the last 54 miles on a leg that , it turned out , had suffered a stress fracture just below the knee . // Maxwell faced his final crisis the next morning when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his blistered and bloody feet into his size 9 shoes . Fortunately , the size 12 shoes of one of his support crew were just large enough , and Maxwell finished the race in them . // By the time he staggered under the archway of Scotty 's Castle , Maxwell had lost 18 pounds . At 37 hours , 57 minutes , he had also trimmed more than 13 hours off his previous time . // For a second time , Crutchlow finished six hours later . Aside from the numerous painful blisters , he experienced another problem with his feet . " Somehow I lost some toenails . I do n't know why . Maybe it was the bloody bananas . " // Well , now , some people never do learn , and nine years later Crutchlow is making noises about a third race . " Lately I 've been thinking about challenging Maxwell to run Death Valley again , " he says . " The s.o.b . beat me twice , and I 'd really like another chance at him . I 'm going to keep at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maxwell was informed of Crutchlow 's recent remarks , he was incredulous : " He said that ? You know , I would n't have thought I 'd race him again , but after hearing that , I just might have to . There 's no way Crutchlow could beat me. " // Stay tuned .
