A Defense Department spokesman said a pool of 15 journalists , none of them from daily newspapers , had flown from Bridgetown , Barbados , to Grenada in a military C-130 transport plane . The spokesman said that beginning Friday , there were plans for twice-daily flights of reporters to Grenada ferrying 20 to 25 reporters at a time . The pool reporters will then share their information with other reporters. // All the reporters will have to return to Barbados on the same day , the spokesman said . The journalists ' return was reportedly delayed today because heavy military air traffic had priority . The return to Barbados is necessary , the spokesman said , because there is no way to file reports from Grenada . <> <> Reporters Taken to Carrier // Four American journalists who arrived in Grenada Tuesday on a chartered fishing boat with two foreign reporters were taken from the island Wednesday to the helicopter carrier Guam . Today , the four were flown to Barbados . The whereabouts of the foreign reporters were not known . Anthony Marro , managing editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent , Morris Thompson , who told him that on Wednesday the four reporters , eager to leave Grenada in order to file stories , had accepted an offer to go to the Guam , from which they they thought they could send their dispatches. // When they arrived on the carrier , however , Mr. Marro said , the commanding officer told them he could not let them use the ship ' s communications eqiupment without approval from Washington . " In effect , they were held incommunicado . " Mr. Marro said. // The Administration ' s assertion that it had not allowed reporters to go to the island until military commanders had determined that it was safe for them was sharply criticized in both Congress and the press. // The American Society of Newspaper Editors said the restrictions on coverage imposed by the Reagan Administration " go beyond the normal limits of military censorship. " // <> <> ' Unprecedented and Intolerable ' // Jerry Freidheim , executive vice president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association , said the limitations were " unprecedented and intolerable " and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of secret wars hidden from the American people. " // A lengthy argument erupted on Capitol Hill between Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes , Democrat of Maryland , at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Senator Sarbanes asked Mr. Dam about reports that the Pentagon had " learned a lesson " from the British during the Falkland Islands war , when reporters ' dispatches were censored. // " I ' m not aware we ' re censoring the press , " Mr. Dam said . He said the press had been kept off the island because of " advice from the Joint Chiefs of Staff " that the security of reporters could not be guaranteed. // " Would you say that in a free society , free press coverage of a news event is an important matter ? " Senator Sarbanes asked // " Yes , " Mr. Dam replied // Senator Sarbanes said : " I think the treatment by the Administration of the free press raises very disturbing questions about our functioning as a free society . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping the press out. " // Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum , Republican of Kansas , said many reporters had worked " under far worse circumstances in Lebanon. " // After the hearing , Mr. Sarbanes said the Administration ' s " answers on their limitation of a free speech are completely inadequate. " // " If we continue to have Americans there , " he said , " we certainly could have the press there. " // The dispute over coverage spilled over to the White House . On Monday night , only hours before the invasion of Grenada , the chief White House spokesman , Larry Speakes , was asked by newsmen whether an attack there was imminent. // The spokesman ' s office , after consulting the National Security Council , replied that the suggestion was " preposterous . " Mr. Speakes said later that he had been misled and apologized . Today , he denied reports that he had threatened to resign , but had no comment when asked whether he had sent a memorandum to key Reagan White House aides saying that " the credibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who left Barbados for Grenada included representatives of the three main television networks - ABC , CBS and NBC - along with reporters for the three major news agencies - United Press International , Reuters and The Associated Press . <> <> Newspapers Not Represented // There were protests at the absence of a pool reporter for news magazines and one for daily newspapers . A reporter for U.S. News and World Report was added to represent the news magazines , but no one was picked to represent daily newspapers . A liaison officer in Barbados , Maj. Don Black , said the list had been determined " with input from the embassy. " // A Defense Department spokesman in Washington confirmed that there were " no newspapers on today ' s run . " He said it could not be determined which newspaper would act as a pool reporter for the other newspapers but that newspapers should be represented Friday. // There are said to be at least 300 reporters in Barbados trying to cover the situation in Grenada. // The Reagan Administration ' s policy on coverage has caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Reagan Administration has produced a bureaucrat ' s dream , " said John Chancellor of NBC News . " Do anything , no one is watching. " // Walter Cronkite , the former CBS News anchorman , said in a radio interview that the Administratrion had seriously erred. // " This nation is founded on the belief that people have the right to know and that we participate in our Government ' s actions , " Mr. Cronkite said . " These are our marines , our Rangers down there . This is our foreign policy and we have a right to know precisely what is happening , and there can be no excuse in denying the people that right.
