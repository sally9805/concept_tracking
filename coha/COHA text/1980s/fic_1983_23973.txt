51 LEE A story by Jonathan Penner N A MAP , or better a globe , I could show you where I met her . We were the first night out on the Queen Elizabeth 2 , and they 'd said over the loudspeakers we were a hundred miles west of Ireland . I was n't thinking about girls , I 'm not the kind that does . This crossing I had a project  --  starting a sort of history , family history , a history of my family . I may be the last of us . So I went to the writing room , and they have this very thin airmail paper with Cunard on it and a profile of the ship , and I thought about my grandfather ? he came the same direction by sea . Broke : he touched his pockets proudly every time he told me that . I held a pen with both hands and remembered his fingers , fat like they 'd been blown up with water , touching and tapping his pockets . You know his name . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writing room I went to the Club Lido ? that 's the First Class nightclub , you sec it in the Cunard brochure  --  and they had a singer on , her big glossy photo on a tripod by the door , you know those pictures  --  all long dark hair and big dark eyes ? The Sensational Madeline Lee , it said underneath . Inside was Madeline . She sat on a high stool , legs crossed and one heel hooked over a rung , and a red curtain hanging in folds behind her and her piano player , and I 've seen many attractive singers , but this one was different , or something was . I knew in five seconds that something was different . She had a low voice for a woman , with a rawness in it . She never gestured , just moved her head from side to side , looking at everyone , and she did it all with her eyes and her voice . A girl that young Jonathan Penner teaches at the University of Arizona . His story collection , Private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be published in the fall of 1983 by the University of Pittsburgh Press , and slim . There was n't a sound in the room while she sang  --  you could just see the cigarette smoke curling up from the tables , and tiny suns reflecting off a percussion set  --  and under the floor you could feel the ship 's big screws vibrate through the water , spinning at the ends of their shafts . O FELL , what , in love with her that night ? I hardly believe that love exists at all , except in a few people  --  like genius . I 'm no genius  --  I admit that . I do n't know anyone who 's a genius , and I do n't think I know anyone who really loves anyone else . I 'll say this : I fell under her spell . My guess was she was lovers with her piano player , a really athletic-looking young guy  --  they were flashing each other smiles all evening . She was probably having a last drink with him in their cabin and getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I ever had one dream , not one small hope , I 'd get anywhere with her . I just felt like I 'd die if I did n't . And of course I knew I would n't die either  --  I 'd just end up a little different in some bad way . I lay awake , feeling the rolling of the ship , all night . At about four I got up and climbed to the boat deck , and stood looking down at the water boiling along , black with sometimes the white crest of a chesty wave . My father would have called her a burnmerkeh and never looked at her again  --  this was a man who lived only for business  --  and I said I 've never known a genius , but if anyone came close it was my father . He 'd have been amazed to see this happening to me . During the night I could feel the ship rolling much worse , and the next morning people were staggering . I took it slow  --  if I turned an ankle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankles are weak anyway , I ca n't dance and so forth . Breakfast did n't interest 52 me this morning . Aft , one deck is reserved for First Class , and 1 went there and lay in a deck chair . The way we were rolling I knew better than to try and read . I folded my hands on my stomach and shut my eyes and thought about that pretty young singer , and it hit me harder than ever . Everything that was good in my life seemed to turn to , I do n't know , just photos of things that were good  --  they were no use to me anymore . I lay there in the sun with my eyes closed , and maybe slept , until the deck steward came around , just like it states in the brochure , to ask if I wanted consomme . I shook my head without opening my eyes . So he asked the person in the next chair  --  I did n't even know there was anyone there . The voice that answered him , I recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said yes to the consomm ? , and I admit I let it get to me , how nice I could hear her being to the steward . A while longer and I opened my eyes and stretched . Madeline had her deck chair propped up , she was sipping consomme and reading a paperback . I could see the cover . One thing I could tell her was there were better books than that  --  I buy the Editors ' Choice , not the Best Sellers . " Excuse me , " I said . She turned her whole head , and I felt like her eyes would knock me over the side of the ship , she was so close and so pretty . And she had that power , like she was still on stage . " I did n't have any . Normally it 's too salty for me . How is it ? " " 1 know you , " she said . " You were at the show last night . You were the one at the table in front by yourself . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have my grandfather 's jaw and shoulders , and my mother 's eyes , and I learned from my father that you do n't dress cheap . " You were great , " I said . " Thank you , " she said , and smiled , and that was that no asking how did I like this number or how she actually had a cold -- -she was ready to drop it right there . " Are you on business or pleasure ? But no one takes the QE2 on business , do they . " " I 've been sight-seeing , " I explained . " France and mostly Switzerland . I got on at Cherbourg . " A woman likes it , my mother told me , if a man has money  --  it makes her feel protected . Madeline was nodding , as though she had n't been to those countries and thought I would n't like her if I knew . " Did you ski ? " She was trying to sound sophisticated but missing by a mile , and I knew I 'd remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ski , " I told her . " I have some kind of weakness in my ankles . Of all stupid places . " She did n't smile . Instead she looked concerned , so that I felt like leaning over and kissing her . " Ca n't you exercise them ? " " My orthopedist says no . " And now she did smile . " I never learned to ski either , " she said . " What do you do for a living ? " When the honest truth is you do n't do one useful thing in the world , you get very smooth at answering that question . " We 're in the fur business , " I said . Next she was going to ask me what I did in the fur business , and I 'd say I was in a supervisory capacity . But what she said was , " I 'm a child of the garment industry too . My father 's a tailor . " A child too  --  like we were the same generation . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached across to shake her hand , except she still had her paperback in one hand , closed around a finger that was keeping her place , and in the other hand her cup of consomme . I would have done it anyway , and made her put the book down , just to show I was comfortable with beauty  --  you want beauty , you should see what walks into our shop all day  --  but she had something else that paralyzed me . " Madeline Lee , " she said . " Look at that , we have the same initials . " And her face curled as though she 'd discovered we were old classmates , something intimate , something from the far past . " It 's my professional name . I 'm really Lefkowitz . " And she put down the book and reached across to shake my hand . Hers was small and strong and  --  I guess from the warm cup of soup  --  warm . Now , I 'd thought she might be Jewish . People named Levy always wonder about people named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotionally , had nothing to do with that . But if there could be anything that would tie me up tighter , that was it . My mother is still alive , not healthy but alive , and if I ever did get married I would rather for her sake , I mean my mother 's , that the girl was Jewish . " A pleasure , " I said . I held her hand a minute to show her the way I felt . That 's when I noticed the wedding ring on her other one . It did n't bother me one bit . I mean there were already so many other reasons why she 'd never want me , what did it matter ? I was actually glad , because it took the pressure off . But it also gave me one more thing to think about , even though I knew I was just lowering myself in deeper . " I sec you 're married , " I said , letting go of her hand . " Is your husband the piano player ? " She shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only likes men , in fact . " " Is your husband a singer also ? " " He 's a graduate student at Columbia . In American Studies . He 's doing his thesis on Bellow . Do you like Bellow ? " Now , I know Bellow . Not Bellow , I mean his literary works . They used to be New and Recommended , before Editors ' Choice even existed . But I knew better than to start in with Madeline . She 'd begin telling me about her husband 's thesis and I would n't understand it . " 1 have n't read enough of him , " I said . lend you , " she said . " I carry some with me . Not this . " She reached down and snapped a fingernail against her best seller , like she was getting rid of something disgusting . " My accompanist 's , " she said . " Schlock . " How insulting it was , in a way  --  hut she looked at me so full in the eyes , like she was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , if I 'd let her  --  that I just felt myself get weaker . I wo n't try to describe it , you 've either felt that way or you have n't , and if you have n't I pity you  --  I pity you either way . " What 's he like , " I said . " Your husband . " She stretched , pointing her toes . " We get along pretty well . Except we 're really poor . This is the first really good-paying job I 've had . " The ship was rolling more than ever , Madeline and I swaying so much that I was afraid it looked silly . " I 'd better go in , " she said . " I had to wear my second-best outfit last night because my first-best was ripped . I 've got to sew it up . " " Do n't they have someone who 'll do that for you ? " " I would n't trust them . My father 's a tailor , remember . I carry a sewing kit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted . I reached out an arm but she got her balance . " Martin , it was really nice talking to you . " From the heart , that seemed . " Will I see you at the show tonight ? " I said she would . Madeline smiled . Then , with tiny careful steps , she walked away . The rolling of the deck made her cross it in a zigzag , like a little boat herself , tacking against the wind . I T SEEMS it 's always this way  --  you do n't know what makes you feel the way you do . Most of that day , I lay on my bed and felt faint from the motion of the ship , and from not having had any breakfast or lunch . And that got confused with the way Madeline made me feel . I 'm not saying I suffered ? 1 think only a few people ever really suffer  --  but it was like nothing else that ever happened to me . Maybe its the age I 've reached , or somehow the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such , I do n't know , despair . My apartment , my car , my paintings , my friends , the restaurants where they know me , everything 1 own , everything I ever did  --  I imagined God or someone saying I could have Madeline if I gave up all the rest , and I grabbed her . Then I began thinking , lying there on my bed , about the steward who 'd brought the consomme , how nice she 'd been to him , and whether she 'd been just the same to us both . To me she 'd been really sweet , but that could have been just her nature . If the sun shines , that does n't mean it loves you , or if a bird sings  --  you get the way I was thinking . In late afternoon the rolling eased up , but I felt too impatient for dinner and just had a platter of sandwiches brought to my cabin . Then I spent a few dollars On the fruit machines in the casino , and drank some Glenfiddich at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madeline 's show I was pretty far gone  --  I was looking on the wrong deck for the Club Lido . When I finally found it , all the front tables were filled . I sat in back , next to a tray filled with little triangles of club sandwich stuck through with fancy toothpicks . They show those in the brochure , except in the brochure the tray is silver . I could see why her first-best dress was first-best . She 'd been pretty last night , but tonight she was gorgeous . I knew I 'd had too much to drink . But I could n't believe that was why every note she sang hit me like a harpoon , or why she looked so  --  I do n't know  --  magical , when she sang " Over the Rainbow " and the gels of the spotlight bled through all the colors , starting her in darkness and ending up in brilliant white . She saw me and smiled , and I waved . But when she took her first break and I wanted to buy her a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of weight , but I 'd never let myself get like this guy  --  got there first , and moved her and her piano player over to the bar . Maybe he was a real funny-man , but he had her in stitches , all through the set the next group was doing , so she half fell over , catching herself on his arm , and he put his other arm around her shoulders for a second . Her piano player was n't laughing , and I thought I saw him give me a look , kind of a well-what-do-you-expect look . She must have told him something about me , just the way she told me about him , and I thought that was lousy of her . Then , at the end of Madeline 's second set , she did something that I think I 'll think about every day for the rest of my life . " Now I 'd like to sing one of my very favorite tunes , " she said , and climbed down from her tall stool . " But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out over the crowd . " Anyone here named Marmaduke ? " Chuckles . " All right , I 'll take an Ebenezer . " " Me Charlie , " some drunk called . She laughed like it was a really clever joke . " How about Martin , " she called , not looking at me . " Any Martins ? " I was on my feet in a second and scrambling forward between the tables like some sort of ape , knocking against people , tilting their drinks  --  I do n't know , I did n't look back . All I saw was what was happening ahead of me . The fat bald guy was getting up from his front table , walking forward onto the hardwood . He reached her just ahead of me . " Martin Levy , " I practically shouted . He looked back over his shoulder . " Sorry , Martin . I 'm Martin Luther . " Everyone howled . They were on his side . But I looked past him at Madeline and I saw , I swear to God I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't planned this , she did n't want this to be happening to me . Any other time I would have just sat down , but now never . " Identification ! " I yelled , and whipped out my wallet . They all laughed while T hunted for my driver 's license , bul I finally found it and pressed it into Madeline 's hand . She read it out loud and clear . " Levy , Martin Isaac . " There were cheers . A few boos . The fat guy had out a credit card , and was holding it toward her , but half covered up . She tried to get it out of his hand , the whole meaty paw up to her face , while he hung on , grinning , and the crowd was yelling . Finally she got it loose . " Arthur Greenfield , " she called . There were boos , cheers , applause , whistles . " Siddown , Art , " someone yelled , and then two women he 'd been sitting with came and pulled him off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was looking disgusted , and I recognized the intro , but it was n't until she raised her arms to me and sang " I ... could ... have da-a-anced all night " that I understood what she was offering . And here I was with weak ankles . Like I told you , I do n't dance  --  it 's too risky for me . But I did . What else could I do , after what she 'd done , and if this did n't show she felt something , then what did ? I was careful , and she let me go after a few turns . Back in my chair , I crossed first one leg and then the other , feeling my ankles . My head was spinning as I watched her finish the song . Let 's not talk about love . But I 'll tell you this , and nothing that happened later will make me deny it  --  I felt joy . I did . Joy . And it was like when I yelled " Identification ! " a new life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went like magic . After she closed her last set I got her to the casino bar , and we talked there , and I held her hand , and it was all just as natural as it could be . She said how nervous she 'd been about the Martin thing and thanked me for demanding identification , she said what presence of mind I had . I remembered that the Captain 's cocktail party for First Class passengers was tomorrow and sug-Bested we go together  --  she said yes , let 's . It came out that my family was Samuel Levy Furs , Fifth Avenue . Madeline said she 'd been by and admired our pieces , and I said we did n't do endangered species , and she said she did n't have any furs at all , her husband would hit the roof if she even bought fox or rabbit at the Salvation Army , he was so left-wing , he thought it was a sign of God knows what , and I said , I do n't know what , maybe I just looked understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , and we had more to drink , and I told her about myself , how I 'd never been married and so forth . So the bar closed . So I walked her to the elevators . And I knew , if I ever knew anything in my life , that if I asked her to come to my cabin , she 'd come ? she wanted to come with me  --  I knew it , I could feel it . But my mouth was like it was sewed together . And the elevator arrived , and I punched my deck button , and , God help me , / could n't help looking at her , and then she had to tell me her deck , and it was a different deck , and that was that . 55 LAY in bed , and I was never sa furious at myself in my life . But only at first . Then I realized I 'd been pretty Lucky . Because it was true  --  she was nice to everyone , the consomme . steward and the fat bald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd become close at the bar , and that had been genuine , but I guessed she could have gotten that close with almost anyone . It was just the way she was . And if I slept with her , that would n't mean a thing to her  --  why should it , when any man on the ship would have done it ? But to me , the way I felt about her , it would have meant so much that just the thought of it frightened me  --  not making love itself , but what my feelings would be like afterward . I realized that it would be better just meeting her at the Captain 's cocktail party . I 'd keep coming to her shows . In Ncw York we could meet for dinner . Maybe she 'd accept a gift of furs  --  if her husband could n't see them I 'd keep them for her , she could wear them just when she was with me . I kept think-56 ing of her calling for Martins , and myself demanding " Identification ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . The next day it was past noon when I woke up , and my head was killing me . But that was n't all . I suspected it while I lay in bed another hour , trying to fall back asleep . And I found out for certain when I tried to get up for my Bufferin and mouthwash . My ankles were aching , both of them . It was n't so bad . I could n't even blame it definitely on the dancing  --  sometimes they just ache a little . 1 held it against Madeline anyway , my ankles and head both . I guessed she was feeling not so good herself , and maybe not so good about me , and now I was really grateful for whatever had kept us from making love . I doled off and on all afternoon , and by five o'clock felt mostly better . Then I spent too long in the bath and had to shave quickly . I combed my hair and patted on my cologne and got into my underwear . I flicked my shoes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was just seven on the dot when I tugged my bow tie straight and saw in the wall mirror that my fly was visible . The zipper was n't broken  --  the fabric was just pulled to the sides so you could see the gleam of the metal teeth . I pushed the button for the , stewardess , then the button for the steward -- all it would take was setting the hooks so the waist was right . Then I stood there minute after minute , getting panicky , because Madeline was waiting for me . So finally I thought of Madeline herself , Madeline and her sewing kit . I dialed her room but of course she was n't there , she 'd already be at the bar . So I dialed the bar  --  do n't ask me how I got the nerve . I asked for Miss Madeline Lee . I heard them calling her name . " Hello ? " " Madeline ? " " Martin ? " " Madeline , " I said , " I 've had an accident , can you come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can you do that for a minute ? And sew something for me ? " I got it out one word at a time , but I was sweating , and I knew , do n't ask me how , I knew already that she would n't . There was too much going on in the background , or it was the excitement in her voice . It was nothing against me . She just was n't going to come . " What is it , " she asked . ' Not your  --  not the seat of your ? " " No , nothing that funny . " " No , it 's not funny at all , " she said , and you could tell she was trying to keep her voice serious . She was trying to be nice about this . " Martin , I 'm with some people , and the party 's really begun-1 just saw the Captain , I think it was him  --  can you understand ? We 'll meet after my show  --  is that okay ? " " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " If you do n't ? " " No , I will , if you really , really , want me to . Only why do n't you just change ? " " Sure , " I said . " That 's what I 'll do . " " If you want me to come I will , only ? " I hung up and I was just boiling . I thought I 'd go and be very cold to her . But when I got my tux off and stood there looking at myself in my underwear  --  they have these huge mirrors , to make the cabin seem bigger  --  I knew I could n't go . I look my best in a tux . I could n't go out dressed wrong , not feeling the way I was . I 'd be the only guy there who was n't formal . Anyway , I had something else to do . I sat down , and it never felt so good to take the weight off my ankles . I had my family history to think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face if he could know what I was feeling , and my grandfather , smiling and tapping his pockets . I got out my pen , and some of that thin Cunard stationery , and began to write . So a minute later the phone rang . I did n't answer it . I 'm innocent , I admit it , I do n't know what the hell to do , maybe I 'm a failure  --  that 's all , no shame in that  --  but one thing I do know , I know when I 've blown it . I know when I 'm finished . I do n't chase what ca n't be mine  --  I 've always prided myself on that . And my being a failure  --  that 's not true either , exactly . I do n't think anyone in the world is really a failure . I 've got plenty going for me  --  I wo n't talk about material things , but I have some damn good friends . When we docked , one of them was there to meet me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's been months , but I 'm still thinking about Madeline . And I feel terrifically sorry for her , sorry for what she 'll learn about life  --  lots of things I never got the chance to tell her or warn her about . One thing especially , a type she needs to watch out for : people like her . I wish I could teach her that . Sometimes I stand in the front of our shop , where the mannequins look out at Fifth Avenue . I stand on a Persian carpet where we keep our display of pelts . People are always stopping , and someday I know I 'll see Madeline up against the glass . Then go out and warn her right there on the sidewalk : some people , they seem terrific , you think they really like you , and it turns out that 's only the way they are . It is n't you at all  --  it 's them , it 's all them , it 's always them , it 's only them . People like her , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll say , " do n't mean to be cruel ; they just do n't mean to be anything , " warn her , " any more than the Statue of Liberty is really glad to see you , " say , " or the doorman who takes your bags from the cab actually cares if you live or die . " ?
