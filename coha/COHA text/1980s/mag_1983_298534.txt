Goode wins in a primary with the help of white votes <P> For one of his final rallies in Philadelphia 's Democratic mayoral primary , Frank Rizzo ventured into a black neighborhood . Surrounded by bodyguards , the former mayor spoke bluntly . " You know , they 're saying I 'm going to get skunked in the black community . I do n't believe that . I want to win with everybody in this city helping me . " <P> " Boo , Rizzo ! " cried a woman in the crowd . " We do n't want you as mayor . " It was one of the few even slightly rude moments in a remarkably even-tempered , almost genteel campaign . It was also prophetic . Last week , in his quest to be Philadelphia 's first black mayor , W. Wilson Goode reaped 97% of the city 's black vote and took the primary by a margin of 7% . With a 65.6% turnout , the primary , like Chicago 's bitter mayoral bout last month , evidenced emerging black power at municipal polls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the lines were not as sharply drawn as in Chicago . While Harold Washington won just a fraction of the white vote , Goode netted an impressive 23% of it . If Goode , 44 , is elected in November , it would put blacks in charge of four of the nation 's six largest cities : Chicago , Los Angeles , Philadelphia and Detroit . But even cushioned by a 5-to-l Democratic superiority , Goode is no shoo-in . The G.O.P. is girding for a tough fight , hoping to take advantage of a fractured Democratic Party and regain city hall after 32 years out of power . " I 've spoken to some of these people , and there 's going to be a mass defection from the Democratic Party , " said longtime Political Observer Jordon Pitock . " You got ta be honest and say , ' Do you want a black city ? ' If there ever was a chance for the Republicans to win , this is it . " <P> Those chances rest with G.O.P. Primary Winner John Egan Jr. , 39 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidacy . A high school dropout , he made his way from messenger boy to chairman of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange , amassing a personal fortune . Goode strategists hope that Egan and the independent candidate , Thomas Leonard , a former city controller and Democrat , will split the vote of disaffected whites . Goode 's campaign will continue to avoid direct appeals to black pride and to highlight his impressive credentials . The son of a sharecropper , he holds a master 's degree in government administration from the University of Pennsylvania 's Wharton School . He served as state public utilities chairman and for the past three years held the visible position of managing director of the city under retiring Mayor William Green . He plans to present himself as a unifying force . Said Goode : " We 're not against anyone ; we 're for everyone who lives in the city . " <P> In defeat , as in his 14 years as Denver mayor , William McNichols Jr . was the consummate Irish pol . " What do you want me to do , faint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he puffed on his cigar . So " Mayor Bill , " 73 , bowed out after finishing a stinging third in a field of seven in last Tuesday 's election . Slogging through a freak spring blizzard , voters favored former State Legislator Federico Pefia and former District Attorney Dale Tooley , who will meet in a runoff on June 21.
