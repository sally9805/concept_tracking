Despite a ban , U.S. weapons are still flowing <P> From the outside , the brick-faced building looked like any other shop in prosperous , suburban Stamford , Conn . Above the broad plate-glass window , a large painted sign read simply PERSIAN RUGS . But inside there were no customers looking at the dusty piles of carpets . Instead , behind a curtain in the rear of the shop , telex machines , shortwave radios and computerized communications gear hummed continuously . Business was brisk , and it had nothing to do with rugs . The shop was a front for the illegal sale of U.S.-made weapons and aircraft parts to the government of Iran 's Ayatullah Ruhollah Khomeini . <P> The Stamford store was opened in 1980 by Balanian Hashemi , a wealthy Iranian businessman who had fled his country after the fall of the Shah . Although he had lost favor with the mullahs , Hashemi had no qualms about making money from their revolution . As thousands of Iranians gathered daily in the streets of Tehran to shout " Death to America ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. embassy , holding 52 Americans hostage for 444 days , Hashemi was selling U.S. arms to Iran . Ordered by the Iranian military to be more discreet , Hashemi closed the shop last year . He now directs his U.S. and international arms operations from London . <P> Hashemi is not alone in pursuing the illegal arms trade with Iran . TIME has learned that hundreds of millions of dollars ' worth of U.S.-made military equipment continues to flow to Iran each year , despite a State Department ban on all arms sales to that country . The suppliers include at least a score of American companies as well as international arms dealers operating in the U.S. In addition , large quantities of American arms sold legally to such allies as South Korea and Israel are being resold to Iran in clear violation of written agreements with the U.S. <P> American officials privately admit that the traffic in U.S. arms for Iran is out of control . Says a Customs agent responsible for halting illegal high-technology exports at Los Angeles International Airport : " There is a large and active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Iran . " A Pentagon intelligence agent in Washington notes that " whatever the dollar value , it is far more than any of us think . " <P> Customs officials say they are unable to stem the tide because they have neither the manpower nor the technology they need . They accuse the Commerce Department of often approving licenses for materials after Customs has seized them . All the agencies involved claim that the State Department lacks a clear policy . Says a senior Customs official : " As long as you can keep Defense , Commerce , Customs and the Office of Munitions Control separated , the Ayatullah 's purchasing agents have it made . " <P> The State Department seems to be unaware of the scope of the illicit deals . " We have heard these rumors of U.S.-supplied restricted military items getting to Iran for years , " says Barbara Schell , the desk officer responsible for Iran , " but there is no proof . " American diplomats insist that they do not secretly condone the shipment of arms to either of the belligerents in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
