Many residents figured that the fugitives , wanted for the July kidnaping of Kari Swenson , a member of the U.S. biathlon team , and for the murder of a man who helped rescue her , had fled the frigid region before the onset of winter . But not Sheriff Johnny France , who had attended the same high school as the elder Nichols . " I 'm a mountain man too , " he insisted . " It will take one to catch one . I 'll get them .

France promised the thinly dressed but well-armed fugitives " a warm bed and warm food and warm water , " then marched them into a clearing and radioed for help from a helicopter . " I had rehearsed this capture for a long time , " France said afterward . " I had dreamed of it , and everything I did was just as if I 'd been there before . "
