Kuwait convicts bombers <P> At the outset , the 21 men had japed and jested like a group of sophomores about to be reprimanded for a prank . But for some of them , the humor led straight to the gallows . The men were among the 25 terrorists accused of attempted murder and conspiracy against Kuwait after seven bombs rocked the oil-rich gulf state one morning last December , leaving 60 wounded and five dead . " Long live justice ! " cried one relieved young man among the spectators as Chief Judge Ghazi al Sammar declared five of the defendants not guilty . But in the course of his 15-minute verdict , Sammar dispensed sentences of from five to 15 years in prison to seven of the culprits and life imprisonment to seven others . Six defendants ( including three of the four still at large ) were found guilty of plotting murder and sentenced to death by hanging . <P> Five of the condemned men are Shi'ite Muslims who belong to Iraq 's underground and Iran-backed Al Dawa Party . Committed to toppling the regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to punish Kuwait , France and the U.S. for allegedly supporting Iraq in its 42-month war against Iran . Yet the attempt proved to be both ill-managed and ill-starred . Most of the blast from a car bomb outside the French embassy was absorbed by a thick brick wall . Another car bomb , meant to wreck a local petrochemical complex , exploded outside the compound . A truck that burst wildly through the gates of the U.S. embassy was piled high with 45 butane gas cylinders , but only ten of them exploded . Very little was left of Suicide Driver Raad Muftin Ajeel but a fragment of one of his fingers . That was enough for police to identify the terrorist and , apparently , to round up most of his accomplices . While handling the case with singular aplomb , the Kuwaitis also detained scores of suspected dissidents for questioning and deported hundreds of others . <P> But the tremors from the December bombings may not subside for a while . With as many as 30% of its 1.6 million people Shi'ites , Kuwait is highly vulnerable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East . " Now the whole question of Shi'ite Muslim vs . Sunni Muslim has been reopened in our society , " notes the publisher of an influential Kuwaiti newspaper . " If there is any destructive force within our country , it is the sectarian issue . " That the issue is incendiary was proved at the conclusion of the 45-day trial . The terrorists were whisked away in armed personnel carriers manned by soldiers with machine guns . Judge Sammar was driven home in an armor-plated Cadillac.
