The hour was late and the motel parking lot was a jumble of cars , but they were out there anyway , a group of time-worn black men whipping a baseball around with sweet abandon , razzing and wisecracking and carrying on like kids . It had always been like this : the joy of the game transcending rock-hard diamonds and fading light . <P> Four decades ago , they worked their magic in the Negro Baseball Leagues , playing their own game while white men ruled the sport . Tonight they were back together again in Ashland , Ky. ( pop . 29,000 ) , for the third annual reunion of the Negro Leagues . It was the first time that some of them had seen one another since the old days , and they had a lot of catching up to do . The splendid second baseman Piper Davis fired a ball across the lot , popping it in a mitt loud enough to wake the entire motel . Davis , who managed Willie Mays when he played for the Birmingham Black Barons , had turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boy , I still got it , " he said with a grin . Across the way a gnarled old man with a bat on his shoulder stooped over an imaginary home plate while a pitcher grooved a hardball precious inches away . Near by , Chet Brewer , 74 , pitching ace for the Kansas City Monarchs , was telling how Luis Tiant Sr. , who pitched for the Cuban Stars with the same herky-jerky motion that his son made famous in the majors , once got a third strike without throwing a pitch . Fooled by Tiant 's delivery , the batter took a mighty swing - only to discover that the crafty mounds-man had thrown to first base in a pick-off attempt . <P> <P> Black baseball had been around for years when the Negro Leagues were born in the early 1920s . Barnstorming the countryside in ramshackle buses , black teams played 60 or so league games each season , as well as 140 or more pickup affairs against any team , white or black , that promised to pay . They were second-class citizens with first-class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating on their buses when restaurants would n't seat them , playing two and even three games a day before driving all night to the next one . The end came shortly after Jackie Robinson ascended to the majors in 1947 . Other black stars soon followed , taking their fans with them , and by 1950 the leading Negro League clubs were but of business . <P> The idea for a reunion was born three years ago when the town of Greenup , Ky. , a few miles down the Ohio River , discovered that one of its native sons , Clinton Thomas , was known as " the Black Joe DiMaggio " when he played for the New York Black Yankees in the ' 30s . Greenup feted Thomas with an 80th birthday party and invited a group of old-timers from the black leagues . Twelve of them came , and before the party was over , they vowed to do it again the next year . With help from organizers in Ashland , the event doubled in size the second time around , and this year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 52 veterans turned up .
