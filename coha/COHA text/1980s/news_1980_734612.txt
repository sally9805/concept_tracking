txt Q  --  I am interested in finding out the shelf life of various spices and seasonings . A friend told me that spices carry bacteria and that refrigeration is the only way to slow contamination . I checked my spices for date codes . but could find no expiration date . Could you please check ? Tina Napolitano , Barrington A  --  The Food and Drug Administration 's Marie Ekvall replies : ' ' The practice of dating foods in a manner readily understandable by the consumer is called open dating . Many manufacturers open-date their products , although they are not required to do so . There is no law that requires expiration dates on spices . Many companies use code dating on /millets that have a long ' shelf life . ' The code gives the manufacturer and the store precise information about where and when the product was packaged , so if the product is recalled it can be quickly identified and withdrawn from the market .

I ) Bone friends were talking about mazes of tunnels under downtown Chicago . They apparently are uo longer in tine . I am curious . Bill.Wittert , South Lelia Avenue A  --  The tunnels , 40 feet below the surface , are in the area from Chicago Avenue to 16th Street and from Halsted Street to Wabash Avenue . Back in 1909 , the Chicago Tunnel Co. was a flourishing business ; it supplied buildings with coal for heating , and removed the ashes . The 6-foot-by-7-foot concrete tunnels contained 65 miles of tracks upon which ran 150 electric locomotives pulling 3,304 cars . ' The change from coal to oil heat , though , put the system out of business ; the company sealed all access doors in 1959 . During the 1950 Democratic National Convention here , former Cook County Sheriff Joseph Woods considered putting all rioters into the tunnels . Commonwealth Edison was given the green light by the city council in 1974 and used about two . miles of the tunnels for power distribution .
