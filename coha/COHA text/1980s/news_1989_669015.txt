It is assumed that the Knickerbockers of New York , after a leisurely weekend in the Midwest , will have grace enough to send a note of thanks to the Bulls of Chicago for allowing them to return to Madison Square Garden refreshed and ready to play some hard basketball in Game 5 of the current series , that being obviously the one they have been saving up all that energy for . No matter that the Knickerbockers now must win three games in a row to prevent being eliminated , not to mention halting a general uprising among their constituents , a lot already walking that fine edge between rage and assault . The Knickerbockers were clearly expected to have been pushing brooms across the Chicago Stadium floor by now , as they did in Philadelphia after sweeping the 76ers . The Bulls , however , have taught them that victories are overrated . What is important is the Knickerbockers have their health . In Game 4 Sunday , the Knickerbockers once again made Michael Jordan work his regal little ankles off while they , for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points and rebounds . The result was another win for the Bulls , this being the third of four and one short of enough . However , the Knicks did look more spry at the end , except for guard Gerald Wilkins , who was limping . " Are you sure he ' s hurt ? " asked Jordan , having picked up his suspicious instincts from the Knckerbockers ' little maze-runner of a coach , Rick Pitino . I am not in the advice-giving business . Well , yes I am in the advice-giving business , but I do not generally waste a perfectly good opinion on someone else ' s problem . But for Pitino , I will make an exception . After all , Pitino offers free advice himself to people he does not know , such as Sunday ' s suggestion to a couple of Chicago inquisitors that one ' s question was nonsense and that the other might like to visit Bellevue when in New York . I doubt that Pitino has any special animosity for strangers . Earlier in the series , he warned people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a notion that I am sure had occurred to none of them . In any case , to Pitino , I say , do not annoy Michael Jordan . Do not doubt Michael Jordan . Do not fuel Michael Jordan . The next time Jordan says he is hurt , offer him a choice of physicians . Send regrets . Do not scoff . " What does he know about my body ? " Jordan asked . " What does he know about me ? " For the record , this is what Pitino says he knows : " When you ask who is the best player in basketball , you have to say right now it is Michael Jordan . Not only is he great by himself , he makes everybody on the court better . " When he first came in the league , they said , Oh , he ' s just a scorer . ' Now you have to realize that Michael Jordan is the consummate team player and that he ' s great at all phases of the game . " Too late . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview , caught him at the time Jordan was treating his own strained groin , caught Pitino saying that Jordan wasn ' t really hurt . " It offended me , " Jordan said . The result , in numbers , was 42 minutes played-five more than any of the Knicks-47 points , 11 rebounds , 6 assists and a 13-point win . Pitino had questioned the comparative fitness of the two teams after Saturday ' s game . The Knicks , especially Patrick Ewing and Jackson , were rested on purpose as Pitino surrendered early . And what did all that energy-saving accomplish ? In the fourth quarter Sunday , a quarter that began with the Bulls up by only four points , Ewing and Jackson scored zero points . Jordan scored 18 . " Apparently , " conceded Pitino , " Michael Jordan is not wearing down in the least . " Pitino had screeched at an official during the game , " You call a little feather foul on Patrick ! Why don ' t you take Michael out of the game , too ? " I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t do it by themselves . A well-rested Ewing missed his last eight shots as well as two free throws and pulled down only eight rebounds in the entire game , three fewer than Jordan . A well-rested Jackson failed to score at all in the second half and assisted on only four baskets in the entire game . " We are in as much physical shape as they are , " Jordan said . I have to disagree . After the game , the Bulls looked exhausted . The Knickerbockers were still fresh enough to serve tea
