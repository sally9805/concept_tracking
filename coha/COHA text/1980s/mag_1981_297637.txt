Misdemeanor for a shooting <P> After listening to three weeks of sharply conflicting evidence , studying 28 separate instructions on the law from the judge , and going into seclusion to weigh six possible guilty verdicts , the jurors in a Fort Collins , Colo. , courthouse had every right to be confused . At issue were such wispy questions as whether Eugene Tafoya , 45 , a much decorated former Green Beret , was working for the CIA or , in effect , for Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi , when Tafoya knocked on the door of Libyan Student Faisal Zagallai , 36 , in Fort Collins on Oct. 14,1980 , and left the outspoken anti-Gaddafi dissident lying on the floor with two bullet wounds in his head . <P> The jury deliberated for three days before finally rendering a verdict that was almost as mystifying as the case itself . The jury found Tafoya guilty only of two misdemeanors : third-degree assault and conspiracy to commit this assault . Maximum sentence : 24 months and a $5,000 fine . <P> Had he been convicted of attempted murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would have faced up to 24 years in prison . <P> The jurors did not accept the prosecution 's claim that Tafoya had been hired by Edwin Wilson , a former CIA agent now working for Gaddafi in Tripoli , to kill Zagallai because the Colorado State student had criticized the Libyan dictator . Still , they did seem to conclude that some unknown other conspirators had sent Tafoya to rough the student up . The fact that Zagallai ended up blinded in one eye , rather than dead , apparently impressed the jurors that Tafoya had not been bent on murder . They were also told by the defense that Tafoya fired his gun only after a struggle during which Zagallai reached for a weapon of his own . <P> The evidence against Tafoya included a transcript of a telephone conversation in which he asked a Wilson associate whether he knew of " anyone who should quit breathing-permanently . " The prosecution contended that this was an offer by Tafoya to become a hired killer . <P> While Tafoya admitted working with Wilson in Libya , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which understandably wanted to know what was going on in Gaddafi 's inner circles . Tafoya 's lawyer added another layer of complexity by suggesting that Wilson , too , might have been working under " deep cover " in Libya for the CIA . Tafoya 's real mission in approaching Zagallai , the defense claimed , was to carry a message from the CIA asking the student to tone down his rhetoric on Middle East issues . But several jurors said after the verdict that they did not believe this story , either . <P> Apparently the jury did not find either side 's case convincing and compromised with a slap-on-the-wrist verdict .
