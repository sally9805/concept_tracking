For something like half a century , Britain ' s intellectual left defined its weeks more or less in this way : as the amount of time between issues of a magazine that surveyed its political and literary world in good , muscular English , confidently setting the agenda and opinions of a wide readership that came to congratulate itself on being so discerning and concerned. // The New Statesman did not print Orwell ' s dispatches from the Spanish Civil War because it felt that his anger over Stalinism tended to muddy an otherwise clear issue , but starting with George Bernard Shaw , an original shareholder , its list of contributors read like a literary who ' s who. // Then , having hit a peak circulation of 93 , 000 in 1965 , it went into steep decline . Its range and sense of audience narrowed as it dwelled predictably and repetitively on favorite issues of the Labor Party ' s " soft left , " from the future of feminism to the varieties of American " imperialism. " // Its influence probably declined faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 by the middle of this year . Yet suddenly , making what a determined new editor frankly describes as a last effort to stay alive , the New Statesman is getting noticed again . <> <> A Cheer From the Right // It got noticed first when it published an editorial politely but insistently questioning the intellectual basis of the Labor Party ' s promise to rid Britain of both British and American nuclear arms . The editorial - calling attention to widespread doubts within the Labor movement " over the wisdom of Britain throwing in its nuclear hand for no guaranteed gain " - evoked an answering editorial cheer from The Sunday Telegraph , whose support for the Conservative Party seldom wavers. // Then , in one of the periodic frenzies into which British officialdom is always ready to throw itself to repulse even the smallest breaches of its habitual secrecy , the New Statesman got noticed by the Foreign Office , which went to the lengths of getting a judicial injunction to keep it from printing a two-year-old diplomatic dispatch by a British ambassador to Saudi Arabia on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characterizations in the manner of a 19th-century colonial official , the ambassador had declared the Saudis to be " incompetent " in what he asserted to be the way other Arabs were - that is , " feckless , disorganized , unconscientious " - only more so. // The High Court agreed that relations with the Saudis could be damaged if the diplomat ' s slur achieved wide currency . And The Independent , a new national newspaper , published a cartoon in which a Conservative speaker , suggesting an appropriate Saudi punishment , puts a motion to a party meeting to " cut off the editor of the New Statesman ' s hand. " // At the New Statesman , John Lloyd , the new editor , needed both his hands to send his ninth issue of the magazine to the printers with a new cover on Northern Ireland after the injunction was handed down . He had erred tactically , he said ruefully in an interview afterward , by giving the former Ambassador , Sir James Craig , notice of his intention to print the document. // " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We should have just published. " // It was a minor battle , in which predictably he got no support from the rest of the British press ; in fact , The Daily Mail and The Daily Telegraph condemned him for giving unnecessary offense to a valuable trading partner . But it showed that things were happening at the New Statesman once again as Mr. Lloyd promised they would in a blunt inaugural editorial addressed to the magazine ' s " many exasperated readers and many more exasperated ex-readers . " <> <> Avoiding Easy Answers // " The incoherence which gripped the left from the latter half of the 1970 ' s could not but encompass its foremost journal , " he wrote , dissecting the causes of its decline . Pledging a new start , he promised " a revived journalism of the left " that would apply honest and tough-minded standards of reporting to " central issues , " avoiding easy answers. // Honest journalism , he acknowledged , was less common in the " committed " broadsheets of the left than the commercial press of Fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. Lloyd , a 40-year-old Scot who had become perhaps the most highly regarded reporter on The Financial Times as a result of his balanced and searching coverage of the yearlong coal miners strike that ended last year. // In fact , he had just been assigned to his newspaper ' s premier foreign post as Washington bureau chief when he seized the dubious opportunity to take over a magazine that was steadily losing money at a cut in pay on the order of $14 , 000 . Any good journalist , he said , could have done the Washington job . The task of saving the New Statesman was fundamentally more challenging. // " I wanted to be a party , I guess , to getting the left back on course , " he said . " I thought the Statesman could be a vehicle for exploring radical policies as well as for the standard radical task of exposing things and expressing outrage. " // The first issue took a fresh look at the so-called hard left inside and outside the Labor Party and at Tony Benn , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article about the centrist Social Democratic Party by a member of its national executive committee who wanted to sound off against its leader , David Owen . Implicitly , the new editor was showing that his definition of " the left " was very broad and that he was prepared to take all its tendencies seriously without being pious about any of them . <> <> In Support of Kinnock // " You talk to these people as a journalist but you ' re not them , " he said defining his stance . In recent years , he said , the magazine had been put out by people preoccupied with the internal debates of the Labor Party ' s left wing " without any sense that events should drive news rather than their own preoccupations. " // Mr. Lloyd ' s editorials have shown that he means to throw whatever weight he has behind Neil Kinnock , the Labor Party ' s leader . But , as the editorial questioning Mr. Kinnock ' s plans for nuclear disarmament showed , he does not mean to follow a party line. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " I ' m a doubtful multilateralist. " // The Labor Party ' s tacticians , believing the issue to be a probable votes loser , plan to say as little as possible about it from now to the general election expected next year . Mr. Lloyd , believing that none of Britain ' s parties has a coherent stance on nuclear weapons , promises to " open up the whole thing , asking fundamental questions. " // " You ask people the questions they may not wish to ask themselves , " he said . He had just finished his 10th straight 80-hour week with no days off , but he smiled happily and said , " It ' s a good time to be a journalist in Britain. " //
