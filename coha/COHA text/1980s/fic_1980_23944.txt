H a r p e r ' s SUNDAY UNDER PAR A short story by Walker Percy T HE FIRST SIGN that something had gone wrong manifested itself while he was playing golf . Or rather it was the first time he admitted to himself that something might be wrong . For some time he had been feeling depressed without knowing why . In fact , he did n't even realize he was depressed . Rather was it the world and life around him that seemed to grow more senseless and farcical with each passing day . Then two odd incidents occurred on the golf course . Once he fell down in a bunker . There was no discernible reason for his falling . One moment he was standing in the bunker with his sand-iron appraising the lie of his ball . The next he was lying flat on the ground . Lying there , cheek pressed against the earth , he noticed that things looked different from this unaccustomed position . A strange bird flew past . A cumulus cloud went towering thousands of feet into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second glance . But as he gazed at it from the bunker , it seemed to turn purple and gold at the bottom while the top went boiling up higher and higher like the cloud over Hiroshima . Another time , he sliced out-of-bounds , something he seldom did . As he searched for the ball deep in the woods , another odd thing happened to him . He heard something and the sound reminded him of an event that had happened a long time ago . It was the most important event in his life , yet he had managed until that moment to forget it . Shortly afterward , he became even more depressed . People seemed more farcical than ever . More than once he shook his bead and , smiling ironically , said to himself : this is not for me . Then it was that it occurred to him that he might shoot himself . Next , it was an idea that he entertained ironically . Finally , it was a course of action that he took seriously and decided to carry out . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . It astonished him that as farcical as most people 's lives were , they generally gave no sign of it . Why was it that it was he , not they , who had decided to shoot himself ? How did they manage to deceive themselves and even appear to live normally , work as usual , play golf , tell jokes , argue politics ? Was he crazy or was it rather the case that other people went to any length to disguise from themselves the fact that their lives were farcical ? He could n't decide . What is one to make of such a person ? To begin with : though it was probably the case that he was ill and that it was his illnessdepression  --  that made the world seem farcical , it is impossible to prove the case . On the one hand he was depressed . Walker Percy 's most recent novel is Lancelot . This story is excerpted from his novel The Second Corning , which Farrar , Straus &; Giroux will publish in June . On the other hand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is possible to make the case that , for some time now , life has seemed to become more senseless , even demented . with each passing year . True , most people he knew seemed reasonably sane and happy . They played golf , kept busy , drank , talked , laughed , went to church , appeared to enjoy themselves , and in general were both successful and generous . Their talk made a sort of sense . They cracked jokes . On the other hand , perhaps it is possible , especially in strange times such as these , for an entire people , or at least a majority , to deceive themselves into believing that things are going well when in fact they are not , when things are in fact farcical . Most Romans worked and played as usual while Rome fell about their ears . But surely it is fair to say that when a man becomes depressed , falls down in a sand trap , and decides to shoot himself , something has gone wrong with the man , not the world . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or who say they are not , who is to say that the depressed person is right and the ninety-nine wrong , that they are deceiving themselves ? Even if this were true , what good would it do to undeceive the ninety-nine who have diverted themselves with a busy round of work and play and so imagine themselves happy ? The argument is abstract and useless . On the other hand , it is an undeniable fact that more people than ever are depressed nowadays . At last count , the symptom of depression outnumbered all other symptoms put together . What if the proportion of undepressed to depressed people changes from ninety-nineto-one to fifty-fifty ? Perhaps the argument will become less abstract . A T ANY RATE and regardless of who was or was not demented , something odd did happen to him on the golf Coarse . It happened , in fact , on the day after he had received the local Rotary 's man-of-theyear award for service to the community . He and his partner , Dr. Vance Battle , were one down and two to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogleg with a good view of Sourwood Mountain , curving past a pond and a low ridge of red maples , which in the brilliant sunlight looked like a tongue of fire searing the cool green fairway . It was not a difficult hole . Par golf required only that you hit two fair woodsto clear the point of the ridge for an easy straightaway pitch to the green . His drive was well hit and went high in a strong following wind . It carried a good 300 yards . His partner gave him a wink . The other players looked at each other . Though the ridge and the pond lay between him and the green , he decided to go for the flag . The instant he hit the ball with a three-wood , he knew it was all right . It drew slightly , enough to give the distance and to grab and hold the sloping green . Without seeing the ball , he knew he had a putt for an eagle . His partner , Dr. Vance Battle , who sat in the cart on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was watching . Vance looked at the green , looked back at him , held his hands apart as if he were measuring a fish , cocked his head , winked again , and , though it could not be heard , gave a cluck : tchk . He looked down at the glossy brown club-head . We used to call this club a spoon , he thought , not a three-wood . What do you think ? he once asked an ancient black caddy at Sea Island . That 's a spoon shot , the caddy said with a certain emphasis and a rising cadence and handed him the club with the complex but clear sense of what a spoon could do . Now you choose a numbered club from the back of an electric cart . It was at that moment that he paused for several seconds , wood still held in both hands , fingers overlapped , and seemed to listen for something . He gazed up at the round one-eyed mountain , which seemed to gaze back with an ironical expression . Certain " quasi-sensory " symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . There was a slight , not unpleasant , twisting sensation in his head . A pied weed at the edge of the rough gave off a faint but acrid smell that rose in his nostrils . The bright October sunlight went as dark as an eclipse . The scene before his eyes seemed to change . It was not really a hallucination . he learned from another doctor , but an " association response " such as might be provoked by a lesion in the frontal lobe of the brain , the seat of memory . The doctors did not agree on the nature of his illness or even if he had an illness . Instead of the immaculate emerald fairway curving between the scarlet and gold hillsides of the Appalachians , he seemed to see something else . It was a scene from his youth , so insignificant a recollection that he had no reason to remember it then , let alone now , thirty years later . Yet he seemed to see every detail as clearly as if the scene lay before him . Again the explanation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and records every sensation , sight and sound and smell , it has ever received . If the neurons where such information is stored happen to be stimulated , jostled , pressed upon , any memory can be recaptured . Nothing is really forgotten . The smell of chalk dust on the first day of school , the feel of hot corduroy on your legs , the shape of the scab on the back of your hand , is still there if you have the means of getting at it . Instead of the brilliant autumn-postcard Carolina mountains , he seemed to see a weedy stretch of railroad right-of-way in a small Mississippi town . It was n't even part of the right-of-way but no more than a wedge-shaped salient of weeds angling off between the railroad tracks and the backyards of Negro cabins . It was shaped like a bent triangle , the bend formed by the curve of tracks . Perhaps it was owned by the railroad or perhaps by the utility company , because in one corner there was a small fenced and locked enclosure that contained an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the city , because at the end of this narrow vista of weeds rose the town water tower . Or perhaps it belonged to no one , not even the Negroes , a parcel of leftover land that the surveyors had not noticed on their maps . 0 NLY ONCE in his life had he ever set foot on this nondescript sector of earth . It was shortly after he had seen Ethel Rosenblum . As he took the shortcut home after school , walking the railroad tracks that ran behind the football field , he saw Ethel Rosenblum practicing her cheer-lea ding . She was in uniform , brief blue skirt flared to show gold panties . She was short , her hair was kinky , her face a hit pocked . But as if to make up for these defects , nature had endowed her with such beauty and grace of body , a dark satinity of skin , a sweet firm curve and compaction of limb as not easily to be believed . She was smart in algebra and history and English . They competed for four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could factor out equations after the whole class was stumped , stand at the blackboard , hip hiked out , one fist perched cheerleaderwise on her pelvis , the other small quick hand squinched on the chalk , and cancel out great a.2-b2 complexes zip zap slash , coming out at the end with a/a=1. 1-1 ! Unity ! No matter how ungainly the equation , ugly and unbalanced , clotted with complexes , radicals , fractions , zip zip under Ethel Rosenblum 's quick sure hand and they factored out and canceled and came down to unity , symmetry , beauty . Would not life itself prove so ? No , as it turned out . They knew each other , had sat in the same class for four years . Not twenty words had passed between them . Once in his life had he set foot on this unnamed unclaimed untenanted patch of weeds , and that was when he saw Ethel Rosenblum and wanted her so bad he fell down . So keen was his sorrow at not having his arms around her , his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself down in a litter of algebra books , ring-binders , Literature and Life , down into the Johnson grass and goldenrod , onto the earth smelling of creosote and rabbit tobacco . Ali , that was the smell of the pied weed on the golf course , the acrid smell of rabbit tobacco ! Ethel , why is the world so designed that our very smartness and closeness keep us apart ? is it an unspoken pact ? Is it an ac-39 cursed shyness ? Ethel , let 's me and you homestead this leftover land here and now , this non-place , this surveyor 's interstice . Here 's the place for us , the only place not Jew or Gentile , not black or white , not public or private . Later a doctor raised the possibility of a small hemorrhage or arterial spasm near the brain 's limbic system , seat of all desire , a location that would account for the sexual component of his disorder . " What sexual component ? " he asked . " Doc , that was Ethel Rosenblum and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her now . " Now in the middle of this pretty Carolina fairway in the sweet high mountain air , as the sky darkened and the acrid smell of rabbit tobacco rose in his nostrils , he fell down again , but only for an instant . Or perhaps he only stumbled , for the next thing he knew , the electric cart hummed up behind him and there was Vance . No , he did fall down , because he seemed to see and smell the multicolored granules of chemical fertilizer scattered in the bent Bermuda . I wonder , he said to himself nose down in the bent Bermuda , what would my life have been like if I had had four years of Ethel Rosenblum instead of four years of a dream of Ethel Rosenblum  --  and the twenty words between us : " How you doing , Ethel ? " " I 'm doing fine , Will . How are you ? " " Fine . Did you have a good summer ? " " Fine . I did n't do a thing . Well-1 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeah , I 'll see you , Will . " Ethel , give me your hand . I know a place . On the other hand , how could his life have turned out better if things had fallen out otherwise between him and Ethel Rosenblum , for had he not succeeded in his life in every way one can imagine ? The only sign of something wrong was that he was thinking about a girl ( and a place ) he had known in high school thirty years ago . What if he and Ethel had followed their inclinations , assuming she was of like mind ( and she might have been ! On commencement day after she had given her valedictory and he his salutatory , he had taken her small hand in his and told her goodbye . She had held his hand for a second and shaken her head and said in a fond sorrowful exasperation : " Oh , Will ? ! " ) , and fallen down together in the Johnson grass or wherever , whenever  --  what then ? Would he have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young people and not so young he saw in town who layabout at their ease , good-humored and content as cats but also somewhat slack-jawed and bemused , who looked as if they could be doing the same thing ten years from now and not discontent then either  --  would he have been better off ? Who knows ? A T LEAST be probably would not be falling down on golf courses and recalling odd bits and pieces of the past . Lately he remembered everything . His symptom , if it was a symptom , was the opposite of amnesia , a condition as far as 1 know unnamed by medical science . A whiff of rabbit tobacco in North Carolina reminded him of Ethel Rosenblum and a patch of weeds in Mississippi . An odd-shaped cloud in the blue Carolina sky reminded him of a missing tile in the Columbus Circle subway station that marked the spot where he stood every morning to catch the Eighth Avenue express to work . The tile had been broken out except for a strip at the top that left a grayish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fallen down in the fairway , for now Vance had him by the arm in some kind of expert doctor 's double-grip that holds you erect without seeming to . " That was quite a shot . " " Did you see the ball ? " " It 's a gim me . I been meaning to talk to you . " " Okay . Talk . " " Not here . Come see me at my office . " " Why ? " " I think something is wrong with you . " " Why ? " " People do n't fall down in the middle of the fairway . " " I was thinking of something . " " You thought of something and fell down . " " That 's right . " " You been acting a little off your feed . You worried about anything ? " " No . " " Did those sleeping pills I gave you help ? " " Yes . " No . I did n't take them . " You have n't been with us for some time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your friends . " " How 's that ? " " You do n't say anything . And what you say is strange . " " Such as ? " " You asked me if I remembered a movie actor named Ross Alexander . I said no . You let it go at that . Then you asked me if Groucho Marx was dead . Then you asked me if the tendency to suicide is inherited . Do you remember ? " " Yes . You did n't answer . " " I did n't know . Are you feeling depressed ? " " No . " " What were you thinking about a minute ago after you hit that three-wood ? " " I was thinking about a girl I once knew . " " Then I 'll stop worrying about you . " " Let 's putt out . " " " Okay . " No , wait . " And again he went into one of his spells , a " petty-mall trance , " his doctor friend called them . They were sitting in the cart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was long enough for the doctor to smile uneasily , then frown and lean over the seat to touch him . " What is it , Will ? " " I just realized a strange thing . " " What 's that ? " " There are no Jews up here . " " Jews ? " " I 've been living here for two years and have never seen a Jew . Arabs , but no Jews . When I used to come here in the summer years ago , there used to be Jews here . Is n't that strange ? " " I had n't thought about it . Hm . " Dr. Battle knitted his brow and pretended to think , but his eyes never left the other 's face . " Interesting ! Maybe they 've all gone to Washington , ha ha . " " Come to think of it , how many Jews are left in the state of North Carolina ? " " Left ? Have they been leaving ? I had n't noticed . Hm . " Again Dr. Battle frowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . Were n't there Jews here earlier ? You 're a native . " " Well , there was Dr. Weiss and Dutch Mandelbaum in high school who played tackle . " " They 're not here now ? " " No . " " You see . " " See what ? " " You know , my wife , who was very religious , believed that the Jews are a sign . " " A sign of what ? " " A sign of God 's plan working out . " " Is that so ? " Vance 's eye strayed to his wristwatch . He pretended to brush off a fly . " But what about the absence of Jews ? The departure of Jews ? " he asked , looking intently at the doctor until his eyes rose . " What is that a sign of ? " " I could n't say . " Vance looked thoughtful . " Hm . " It is not at all uncommon for persons suffering from certain psychoses and depressions of middle age to exhibit " ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irrational notions about Jews , Bildebergers , gypsies , outer space , UFOs , international conspiracies , and whatnot . Needless to say , the Jews were and are not leaving North Carolina . In fact , the Jewish community in that state , though small , is flourishing . There were , at the last census , some twenty-five synagogues and temples , 10,000 Jews with a median income of $21,000 per family . The foursome finished the round without further incident . He sank his putt , a ten-footer not a gim me , for an eagle three , won both the $50 Nassau and the press bet , some $200 in all , took much good-natured kidding from his friends while they drank and rolled poker dice in the locker-room bar , a cheerful place smelling of sweat , bourbon whiskey , and hemp carpeting , and dominated by a photomural of Jack Nicklaus blasting out of a sand trap . In all respects he seemed quite himself , though a bit absentminded , but smiling and nodding as usual  --  so normal indeed that his doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " After all , a golfer who cards a seventy-six ca n't be too sick . Surely , though , all is not well with a man who falls down in the fairway , who thinks the Jews have left North Carolina , who finds himself overtaken by unaccountable memories , memories of extraordinary power and poignancy . But memories of what ? Of the most insignificant events and places imaginable , of a patch of weeds in Mississippi , of a missing tile in a gloomy New York subway station , of a girl whom he had not thought of since leaving high school ! I T WAS A FINE Sunday morning . The foursome teed off early and finished before noon . He drove through town on Church Street . Churchgoers were emerging from the eleven o'clock service . As they stood blinking and smiling in the brilliant sunlight , they seemed without exception well-dressed and prosperous , healthy and happy . He passed the following churches , some on the left , some on the right : The Christian Church , Church of Christ , Church of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christ in God , Assembly of God , Bethel Baptist Church , Independent Presbyterian Church , United Methodist Church , and Immaculate Heart of Mary Catholic Church . Two signs pointing down into the hollow read : African Methodist Episcopal Church , 4 blocks ; Starlight Baptist Church , 8 blocks . One sign pointing up to a pine grove on the ridge read : St. John o ' the Woods Episcopal Church , 6 blocks . He lived in the most Christian nation in the world , the U.S.A. , in the most Christian part of that nation , the South , in the most Christian state in the South , North Carolina , in the most Christian town in North Carolina . Once again he found himself in the pretty reds and yellows of the countryside . As he drove along a gorge , he suffered another spell . Again the brilliant sunlight grew dim . Light seemed to rise from the gorge . He slowed , turned on the radio , and tried to tune in a nonreligious program . He could not find one . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods keeping pace with him . He knew what to do . Pulling off at an overlook , he took the Luger from the glove compartment of the Mercedes . As he stepped out , he caught sight of a shadowy stranger in the mirror fixed to the door . But he quickly saw that the stranger was himself . The reason the figure appeared strange was that it was reflected by two mirrors , one the rearview mirror . the other the dark window glass of the Mercedes door . He smiled . Yes , that was it . With two mirrors it is possible to see oneself briefly as a man among men rather than a self sucking everything into itself  --  just as you can see the back of your head in a clothier 's triple mirror . He gazed down at the wrist of the hand holding the Luger . Light and air poured onto the wrist . It was neither thick nor thin . Who can see his own wrist ? It was not a wrist but The Wrist , part of the hole into which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times into the gorge . The sound racketed quickly back and forth between vertical cliffs of rock . Firing the Luger , he discovered , helped knock him out of his " spells . " But it did not work as well as before . He shot again , holding the Luger closer and firing past his face . The sound was louder and flatter ; a wave of hot air slapped his cheek . The gun bucked , hurting his bent wrist . He held the muzzle against his temple . Yes , that is possible , he thought smiling , that is one way to cure the great suck of self , but then I would n't find out , would I ? Find out what ? Find out why things have come to such a pass and a man so sucked down into himself that it takes a gunshot to knock him out of the suck  --  or a glimpse in a double mirror . And I would n't find out about the Jews , why they came here in the first place and why they are leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RATE stands Will Barrett on the edge of a gorge in old Carolina , a talented agreeable wealthy man living in as pleasant an environ-ment as one can imagine and yet thinking of putting a bullet in his brain . Fifteen minutes later finds him sitting in his Mercedes in a five-car garage , sniffing the Luger and watching a cat lying in a swatch of sunlight under the rear bumper of his wife 's Rolls-Royce Silver Cloud three spaces away . During the six months after his wife 's death , the Silver Cloud had occupied its usual space on the clean concrete , tires inflated , not dripping a single drop of oil . Not once had he been able to bring himself to think what to do with it . Beyond the big Rolls , almost hidden , crouched his servant Yamaiuchi 's little yellow Datsun . Absently he held the barrel of the Luger to his nose , then to his temple , and turned his head to and fro against the cold metal of the gunsight . Is it too much to wonder what he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $35,000 car and sniffing cordite from a Luger ? How , one might well ask , could Will Barrett have come to such a pass ? Is it not a matter for astonishment that such a man , having succeeded in life and living in a lovely home with a lovely view , surrounded by good cheerful folk , family and friends , merry golfers , should now find himself on a beautiful Sunday morning sunk in fragrant German leather speculating about such things as the odd look of his wrist ( his wrist was perfectly normal ) , the return of North Carolina Jews to the Holy Land ( there was no such return , and looking for himself in mirrors like Count Dracula ? At any rate , within the space of the next three minutes there occurred two extraordinary events that , better than 10,000 words , will reveal both Barrett 's peculiar state of mind and the peculiar times we live in . First , as he sat in the Mercedes , Luger in hand , gazing at the cat nodding in the sunlight , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the breakthrough he had been waiting for , the sudden vivid inkling of what had gone wrong , not just with himself but , as he saw it , with the whole modern age . Then , as if this were not enough , there occurred two minutes later a wholly unexpected and shocking event that , however , far from jolting him out of his grandiose speculations about the " modern age , " only served to confirm them . In a word , no sooner had he opened the Mercedes door and stepped out than a rifle shot was fired from the dense pine forest nearby , ricocheting with a hideous screech from the concrete floor at his foot to a thunk in the brick of the inner wall . A vicious buzzing bee stung his calf . Later he remembered thinking even as he dove for cover : Was not the shot expected after all ? Is this not in fact the very nature of the times , a kind of penultimate quiet , a minatory ordinariness of midafternoon , a concealed dread and expectation that , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there all along ? Are we afraid quiet afternoons will be interrupted by gunfire ? Or do we hope they will ? Was there ever a truly uneventful time , years of long afternoons when nothing happened and people were glad of it ? But first his " revelation . " As he sat gazing at the cat , he saw all at once what had gone wrong , wrong with people , with him , not with the cat  --  saw it with the same smiling certitude with which Einstein is said to have hit on his famous theory in the act of hoarding a streetcar in Zurich . There was the cat . Sitting there in the sun with its needs satisfied , for whom one place was the same as any other place as long as it was sunny  --  no nonsense about old haunted patches of weeds in Mississippi or a brand new life in a brand new place in Carolina  --  the cat was exactly 100 percent cat , no more , no less . As for Will Barrett , as for people nowadays  --  they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uneasily and more or less successfully . More likely they were 47 percent themselves , or rarely , as in the case of Einstein on the streetcar. 300 percent . All too often these days they were 2 percent themselves , specters who hardly occupied a place at all . How can the great suck of self ever hope to be a fat cat dozing in the sun ? There was his diagnosis , then . A person nowadays is 2 percent himself . And to arrive at a diagnosis is already to have anticipated the cure : how to restore the 98 percent . P ERHAPS it is not necessary to say any more about Will Barrett 's peculiar revelation except to note that if it applied to anyone it applied to him and not to the good folk of Linwood , North Carolina , who , sitting on their sunny patios , did in fact seem happy as cats on this beautiful October Sunday . At any rate , as he absently climbed out of the Mercedes , Luger forgotten but still in hand , he was musing over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had no sooner reached the middle of the garage on his way to the interior door when whangEEEEE the concrete erupted , spat , stung his calf . There followed not in succession but all at once , it seemed , the sound of the shot , a sharp sting , and the solid thunk in the brick . Then  --  and now occurred the most remarkable part of this odd episode  --  in the next instant he was transformed . It was as if the sting in his calf had been the injection of a powerful drug . Quicker than any drug , in the instant , in fact , of hearing and recognizing the gunshot , he was , as he expressed it , miraculously restored to himself . The cat of course had jumped four feet straight up and fled in terror , as any sensible animal would , reduced instantly to zero percentile of its well-being . But Barrett ? The missing 98 percent is magically restored ! How ? By the rifle shot ! In the very same motion of lifting his stinging leg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a roll , shoulder tucked , Luger cradled in his stomach . He rolls over at least three times , enough rolls anyhow to carry him under the high-slung 1956 Silver Cloud and against the far wall , where now he is feeling himself to be himself for the first time in years , flanked as he is by two adjoining walls , the Rolls above him as good as a pillbox affording a slot-shaped view of the sunny woods . And without his taking thought about it , the Luger is now held in both hands stretched out in front of him as steady as if it were propped on a sandbag . Were terrorists after him ? A knee-capping ? Or just shooting up a rich man 's house and Rolls ? Or were they after his daughter Leslie upstairs ? None of the above , as it turned out . It is enough to report that in another minute he had caught sight of an oddly shaped peak of a red cap disappearing in the pines , not a deer-hunter 's cap but a Texaco or Conoco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he recognized the cap-wearer and knew who fired the shot and why . It was Ewell McBee , a covite from the valley below , once his wife 's family 's gardener , who poached deer on Barrett 's 10,000 acres of mountainside . No apocalyptic last-days irruption of terrorism , then , no more than the annual unpleasantness with McBee . No. maybe a bit more : was n't McBee saying , in fact , Maybe you 'd better let me poach so I wo n't make the mistake of shooting up your garage ? He sighed : he 'd rather an Italian terrorist than the complex negotiations with McBee ( pay him a call ? let him poach ? call the sheriff ? buy him a drink ? shoot him ? ) . At any rate , do n't tell Leslie . There he lay for some minutes , sighting down the Luger and speculating on the odd upsidedownness of the times , that on a beautiful Sunday in old Carolina , it takes a gunshot to restore a man to himself . What man ? How many men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many men would have felt better for being shot at on a peaceful Sunday ? Very few white folks and no niggers at all , as they say in old Carolina . Even Barrett wondered . Why is it that I know perfectly well that it was Ewell McBee , that it was an accident , and that I am disappointed ? How does it happen that this is what I do best and feel best doing , not hitting a three-wood on a green fairway but rolling away from gunfire and into a safe corner where I can look out without being seen and where I ca n't be enfiladed all with a secret cool-ness and even taking a satisfaction in it ? This is better than  --  than what ? Very well , here I am and here it is at last , let them come . What have 1 to do with this Luger ? I do n't know , something . Why do I feel myself most myself here and not hitting a three-wood for an eagle on the back nine ? What does my ease with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainty that everything is going to be settled in the end with a gun , with this gun . either with them or with me , but with this gun ? How could I know such a thing ? How do I know that somehow it is going to come down to this , should come down to this , down to me and a gun and an enemy , that otherwise this quiet Sunday makes no sense ? Ewell McBee , it would turn out , had not of course meant to harm him or his house . At least not consciously . He was in fact poaching , had been circling to get upwind from a deer , had lost his sense of direction and got off a shot that by the purest chance ( surely ) had gone ricocheting around the Barrett garage . Strange to say , that made matters worse , to have to listen to Ewell apologize for shooting up his house . If there is an enemy , it is better to know who he is . Ewell McBee , he reflected as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demented and farcical times we live in . Did the growing madness have something to do with the Jews pulling out ? Who said we could get along without the Jews ? Watch the Jews , their mysterious comings and goings and stayings ! The Jews are a sign ! When the Jews pull out , the Gentiles begin to act like the crazy Jutes and Celts and Angles and redneck Saxons they are . They go back to the woods . Here we are , retired from the cities and living deep in the southern forests and growing nuttier by the hour . The Jews are gone , the blacks are leaving , and where are we ? Deep in the woods , socking little balls around the mountains , rattling ice in Tanqueray , driving $35,000 German cars , watching Billy Graham and the Steelers and " M " A*S*H " on 45-inch Jap TV . So said Will Barrett . E WELL MCBEE was one of them , a new southerner and as nutty as a Jute . Ewell , who was exactly his own age , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother spent the summers in Linwood . Ewell caddied for his father . A country boy who lived in a cove of the valley below , hence a covite , he went barefoot and shirtless and wore soft bib-overalls smelling of Octagon soap . He was overgrown and strong and a bully . They used to neck-rassle , stand sweating and grunting , elbows crooked around necks until Ewell threw him down and sat on him for an hour , grinning and daring him to get up , thighs squeezing him , a heavy incubus smelling of sweet boiled cotton , Octagon soap , and thick white winter-white skin . From Ewell 's mother they got fresh eggs and country butter and from his father liquor , not white lightning but charcoal-cured light-amber corn whiskey . From Ewell he had first heard the word pecker and had seen an uncircumcised pecker that he took at first to be a peculiarity of country boys . To his even greater astonishment , Ewell showed him how to jerk off . A bully and a jerk-off Ewell was and remained . Then Ewell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town and became a businessman . As an ex-employee he figured he had a proprietary right to an occasional buck deer . So Ewell had changed and yet not changed . Now if he had a drink with Ewell in a bar booth , Ewell might make a show of not letting him out , actually stand in his way daring him to get past , half-joking , no , not even half-joking . " Boy , I want a piece of you . I could thow you down rat now . " " Well , I doubt if you could but right now let me out . " And Ewell would give way reluctantly , yielding to their middle-aged respectability and to Will Barrett 's great Peabody wealth . All that was left of the bullying was the poaching . " Hail fire , Will , I 'm doing you a favor . You got so goddamn many deer in there they 're chewing on the trees . Anyhow what you going to do about it ? " I 'm sitting astride your 10,000-acre mountain like I sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Ewell came up from the cove , he also came up in the world , operated a Texaco station , then owned a Conoco station , then five Exxon stations , then a movie theater . He shed bib-overalls for the Jaymar Sansabelt slacks and short-sleeved white shirt of small-town businessmen , joined the C of C , ate lunch with Rotary at the Holiday Inn . But Twin Cinema had gone bust and Exxon cut back on gas and so now Ewell needed money and had a new proposition . Ewell wanted him to put up some money for the home-entertainment videocassette business . He had a connection , a fellow in Miami who could supply him with any number of copies of any film at all , Jaws I and II , Godfather I and II , Airport of any year , you name it . More important , there was this whole new market for cassettes designed for motel and home bedroom viewing ; but best of all he knew a young lady , a real professional , a recognized moviemaker , who made such movies right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the college boys and girls who flock to resorts looking for summer jobs and are happy to work for minimum wage . As if it were n't demented enough to go to Rotary lunch every Tuesday where there might be a guest speaker on Encounter and Enrichment in Marriage and hear Ewell tell him solemnly about the value of erotic movies in couples therapy  --  redneck Ewell come up out of the cove and talking about couples therapy ! America is still on the move ! A poor boy can still come up in the world . The South is rising again ! As if this were n't enough , Ewell in the very act of making his pitch ? " your hundred thou will buy you forty-nine percent ; me and my potner , the little lady , got to keep fiftyone " ? Ewell could n't help coming at him again , shouldering him , hemming him up in a corner of the Holiday Inn Buccaneer Room ! He did n't want to let him out ! He wanted to neck-rassle ! Thow him down ! " You gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " She 'll fix you up with a little lady , her leading lady . We gon boogie at my villa tonight . " Lying under the Rolls , Luger still gripped in both hands , he gazed at an arc of sunlit pines . Was Ewell threatening him ? Did he shoot up the garage as a warning : " Either you back my cassette business or ? " ? No , it was too simple . That would mean having a simple enemy . The world is crazier than that . He smiled and nodded : I know why it is better to be shot at on a Sunday afternoon than not be shot at . Because it means maybe there is an enemy after all . If there is no enemy then I am either mad or living in a madhouse . Peace is only better than war if peace is not hell , too . War being hell makes sense . ?
