HOUSTON  --  A surge of summer travel boosted Continental Airlines ' passenger loads in June from the shaky level of May , but the company ' s performance lagged that of a year earlier . The company ' s report indicated that the Texas Air Corp. unit had stemmed at least temporarily an erosion of passenger confidence . Analysts have feared that Continental ' s faltering service , the result of its overnight consolidation with People Express Inc. , would scare away passengers in the revenue-rich summer season . June ' s load factor , or percentage of seats filled , totaled 64. 3% , ranking Continental near the bottom of major U.S. airlines . The figure rose significantly from May ' s low level of 60. 1% , but trailed the 65. 5% of a year earlier . For the month , Continental flew 3. 3 billion revenue passenger miles , a 95% increase from the 1. 7 billion miles a year earlier . A revenue passenger mile is one paying passenger flown one mile . The increase reflects the consolidation with People Express . Analysts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People Express and the prospects of a large-scale , low-cost carrier  --  have been scrutinizing Texas Air ' s load factors . Texas Air , the nation ' s largest airline-holding company , is flying with the heaviest debt load of any carrier  --  about $4. 5 billion . Its roughly $1. 5 billion in cash gives it ample breathing space , but it can ' t afford to lose market share and maintain its low fares . Continental ' s improved load factor was welcome news after months of disquieting developments . Texas Air ' s lead in revenue passenger miles over United Airlines has narrowed each month since People Express ' s operations were folded into Continental ' s , including a further slight decline last month . Continental ' s passenger loads fell in May to four percentage points below the industry average , despite low fares and ticket giveaways in its New York market . Analysts and travel agents attributed the decline to passenger reaction to canceled flights , lost bags and phone and computer foul-ups . " They were clearly losing market share , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a New York investment firm . But Mr. Neidl took heart from Continental ' s June traffic report . " It ' s a little too soon to say Continental is turning the corner , " he said , " but it looks like they are gaining some momentum . " In American Stock Exchange composite trading , Texas Air shares closed at $35. 75 , down 12. 5 cents . Although it isn ' t clear whether June ' s improvement heralded an upswing in passenger confidence , the traffic report did indicate that the airline market would sustain fare increases introduced in June . " That ' s good news for everyone , " said Mr. Neidl , because Continental ' s size and low-cost structure make it the industry fare-setter , and no one is anxious for Continental to fill seats with another round of fare-cutting . " When Continental does badly , " he said , " it ' s a loose cannon for the industry . " A Continental spokesman welcomed the traffic figures , noting that traffic has almost kept pace with its frantic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the markets it ' s in today are not markets it was in a year ago , " he said.  --  - Table Airline Load Factors for June ( in percent ) USAir 69. 3 American Airlines 69. 1 Pan Am 68. 8 United 67. 4 TWA 65. 6 Eastern 64. 6 Continental 64. 3 Piedmont 61. 6 Delta 59. 3 <> Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
