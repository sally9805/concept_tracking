 | Besides calcium , selenium and fiber , we also do n't get enough to smell these days . We have smothered the fragrant earth with concrete until our bodies are starved for a whiff of jasmine . That it should have taken medical science until now to recognize this lack is scandalous , but not surprising . Look at how long it took to invent the negative-ion generator . Actually , it is not entirely accurate to say that medical science has recognized the healing value of smells , a discipline known as aromatherapy . Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman-Marcus have gotten there first . Both sell a line of aromatherapy products marketed by Judith Jackson , a Connecticut masseuse , certified aromatherapist and author of a handbook called " Scentual Touch . " Her certification comes from the MIT of the field , the London salon of Micheline Arcier , long a discreetly fashionable place for European women to enjoy an invigorating massage with scented oils . Jackson 's products , meant to be rubbed on the body or splashed in the bath , contain essences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equally romantic ingredients , suspended in the prosaic medium of soybean oil . They are sold in homely brown bottles at $25 for four ounces , a price and a packaging that serves to set them apart from perfume . Perfume is outer-directed , designed to make the wearer smell like a courtesan . Aromatherapy oils are innerdirected and make a woman smell like a cough drop . Explains Jackson , sort of : " The fragrance affects your whole system through the psyche . " Aromatherapy has up till now mostly been in the hands of masseuses , and only a few of them , but that is changing . A Minneapolis firm , Aveda , began marketing aromatherapy products in 1978 and has doubled its business each year since 1980 to $16 million . Avon recently introduced Tranquil Moments , a bath soap intended to have a calming effect . Interior designer Jay Spectre is planning a line of room scents , to be placed in small electric braziers , including an aphrodisiac scent for the bedroom and a relaxer for the bath . Energy fields ' : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strides in research . Psychologists agree that smells can have powerful effects on people 's emotions , but the claims made for aromatherapy are generally untested and tend to rely more on examples drawn from the wisdom of the ancient Orient . The technique " addresses the nervous system and the energy fields of the body , " says Patt MacDonald , a Chicago practitioner . " It soothes the body , cleans the body , clears the body and tones the body . " The empirical question raised is how to distinguish those effects from that of an ordinary , nonaromatic massage . For devotees like Bonnie Reagan , 35 , a project manager for a Chicago software company , it is not a problem . Aromatherapy makes her feel " grounded and clear , " she explains . " The edges are off . " Is that clear ? If not , you will have to take the word of Horst Redelbacher , president of Aveda , who explains , sort of : " You really ca n't describe aromatherapy . You have to experience it . "  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
