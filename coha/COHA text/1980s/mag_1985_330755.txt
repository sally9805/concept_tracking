Dawn broke with clarity . Even the encircling , snow-topped Sierra Madre was etched sharply in the distance against an azure sky . This was unusual for Mexico City , which is normally shrouded in a brown smog generated by the exhausts of some 3 million cars . But in just four earthshaking minutes , starting at 7:18 a.m. last Thursday , the day 's auspicious beginning turned into a nightmarish disaster  --  and the bright skies only illuminated the extent of the tragedy . <P> " The noise was like thunder , " recalled Tito Garcia Mendez , 60 , who was riding the city 's sleek subway , one of the capital 's brightest successes . " All the lights went out . People began screaming . I felt dizzy . I thought it was because I was hungry . " Fernando Levaro , 21 , a medical student , was driving to an early class . " My car began swinging from one side of the road to the other . I could see lampposts and buildings swaying . People began to run , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible . " Arturo Cholula , 40 , was getting dressed for his day 's duty as a navy ensign . " I started to fall , and my closet came toward me . I felt like a drunk . " <P> A devastating earthquake had hit Mexico City . The quake 's force , measured at 7.8 on the Richter scale , was the world 's most severe since a tremor measuring 7.8 struck the coast of Chile last March . In four chaotic minutes , an estimated 250 buildings collapsed in downtown Mexico City ; 50 more were later judged dangerously close to falling , and the condition of 1,000 others was regarded as unsafe . <P> At week 's end at least 2,000 people were believed to have died , more than 5,000 were injured , and thousands were missing . As rescue workers , all too often digging into the rubble with hand tools , responded to faint cries for help and unearthed ever more bodies , the death toll rose hourly . U.S. Ambassador John Gavin , who flew over the devastation in a helicopter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would eventually be found dead or trapped in the ruins . Said he : " It looked as if a giant foot had stepped on the buildings . " <P> Even as the massive rescue effort was under way , the capital was struck another blow . Just 36 hours after the first temblor , a second quake , though not as powerful as the first , battered Mexico City . This tremor , lasting for at least a minute , toppled some already weakened buildings but caused few new injuries . Mainly , it made the rubble bounce and rekindled fear among the city 's residents , thousands of whom had spent the night in parks and other open spaces . President Miguel de la Madrid Hurtado took note of the " panic " provoked by the second shock , but assured Mexicans that " the damage was much less than the first . " Earlier , in appealing for calm , he had told his countrymen that " we are living through a great tragedy that affects all Mexicans. "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
