THE TALI ( OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment FMST come the stories datelined Enid , Oklahoma , and St Cloud , Minnesota , and Harrison , Wisconsin : stoic state troopers explain to TV reporters that " folks in these parts " are used to forty-four below ; all newspapers , as if by contractual obligation , run pictures of the good people of Minnesota wrapped in breath-frosted scarves . Given the general Eastern tilt of the nation , people in New York usually have some warning of approaching cold weather  --  a day or two to shiver in nervous sympathy as the meteorologists , their voices tight with the drama of it all , decipher those menacing arrows swooshing across their maps from the direction of Canada . Even so , no New Yorker is ever really prepared for the first cold snap of the winter , which this year arrived the week before Christmas .

The first morning of the very cold weather  --  it was seventeen degrees , which may not be Enid but is close enough  --  we caught the M train out to Brighton Beach , next to Coney Island , so that we could stand on the boardwalk , stare out over the waves , and challenge the cold , soak it in . Eventually , it drove us into Dunkin ' Donuts , but first , instead of chilling us to the bone , or sapping our strength , it made us feel clearheaded and full of vitality ; we felt as if the Atlantic were giving us a friendly Aqua Velva slap . And we were not alone . Strollers , mostly older people , wandered the boardwalk , and shoppers wheeled home their groceries under the Brighton Beach " L.

" I just put more coats on , " one man said . " It 's much better than in August  --  when it 's too hot , you ca n't take your skin off to cool down . " The joy that cold weather brings ( a joy much diminished by the end of February , when Old Man W. has overstayed his welcome ) comes from its transformation of the mundane into the adventurous . The first few frosty mornings are the best kind of challenge ; arriving at the office , we shuck off sweaters and begin to carp , with a trace of boasting , about how cold it is out there . The sort of adventures that please us are the ones we are sure of surviving , and without much travail , like those African safaris on which you never leave the Land-Rover , or those trips down the Colorado in unsinkable rubber rafts . They 're interesting , but they 're not too interesting . If there were a chance that our home would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , our landlord chose not to provide heat or we did n't have the funds to pay the fuel bill  --  the approach of winter would be as daunting as it was to the Pilgrims . When you have no hope of escaping the cold , it sometimes seems deadening , and sometimes it literally is . Just as an experiment , sit on a park bench for fifteen minutes the next time it turns bitter cold . First , the chill hunts down every exposed corner , and then it begins to work on your whole body until you 're shivering , and , finally , it just moves in and sets up housekeeping , so that soon you are as cold from the inside out as from the outside in . If you have a hope , but not a guarantee , of getting warm , the cold stops numbing you and begins instead to taunt and then chase you , until there is nothing else to think about .

Enjoying winter  --  calling the cold " bracing " and " refreshing " ? is the greatest of luxuries . ? ? The Young Lions BRIGHT and early on a luminous morning , we plunge into the Lincoln Tunnel on our way to the Meadowlands Arena to greet our longtime friend Gunther Gebel-Williams , animal-master extraordinary , golden-maned superstar of the Ring-ling Brothers and Barnum &; Bailey Circus . ( We usually catch up with him every second spring , when the Red Unit of the circus comes to Madison Square Garden , but last year we missed him . ) An eternal refrain of Gunther 's is " Something new ! Always something new ! " The something new this season is lions The unimaginable has happened : Gunther is training lions . When he was questioned about them in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think hard , and then say , " I do n't know . I guess lions are just not my style . " ( His style is smooth and easy . ) But wherever Gunther went a child would tug at its mother 's skirts , point , and shout , " Look ! The lion tamer ! " This was false on two counts : until now Gunther has never " done " lions ; and wild animals can be trained but never tamed . Clyde Beatty , who faced his lions with a pistol loaded with blanks in one hand and a Thonet chair in the other ( his style was definitely not smooth and easy ) , once said , " The only man I ever heard of who could tame a lion was Daniel . " Once , we heard Gunther say , jokingly , " I got to get me some lions , so when they call me lion tamer at least I look like lion tamer . " ' Then , all of a sudden , we heard that he actually had acquired six lion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zorro , Monarch , Solomon , Juliette , and Tam . Still in search of " something new , " Gunther also devised one of his more spectacular entrances into the arena : riding Roman Post astride two black Morgans on which rode two of the young ions . Here we are . It is nine-thirty . We know that Gunther has been up since eight with his " guys , " as he collectively calls the members of his vast menagerie ; that today he has two shows ( Fridays and Saturdays at Meadowlands he has three , the two days ' stint known as a " six-pack " ) ; that he wo n't have a moment 's rest until after the evening show , when he can put his guys to bed and make his way back to the circus train . The cage in center ring is up . ' The immense arena , which seats seventeen thousand people , is deserted except for a few roustabouts , a few of Gunther 's assistants , and Gunther , alone in the cage with a young lion . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ routine . A slight-of-build man , but so fit and strong as to make a mockery of an impending fiftieth birthday , Gunther is addressing the lion in his native German ( " Bleib bier ! Sitz bier ! Gut ! Gut ! " ) and , a second later , in adopted American ( " Good boy ! " ) . He wears jeans , a white Western shirt with the sleeves rolled up , his usual silver-buckled belt , and soft black shoes on thick soles . Low on his waist rests a second belt , with a pouch in which he keeps , just now , chunks of red meat  --  the positive reinforcement he uses in the training of felines . Through the bars of the cage , Werner Edling , a tall , thin , fair German who is sometimes mistaken for Gunther , hands him more meat . Gunther skewers a piece on the tip of a long black stick ; the young lion jumps and snaps it up . Gunther catches sight of us . " Eleven months on the road ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He directs the young lion to a pedestal . The lion jumps to it and sits . He tries to sit still , but wild animals , like small children , fidget incessantly . And roar and snarl besides . " No vacation in thirty-five years . Soon I 'll be an old man , " Gunther says , and he walks away in a broad takeoff of a doddering nonagenarian while the lion , sitting on his pedestal , slowly turns his head as his eyes follow his master . We attempt to greet Piccolo , who is standing nearby . Piccolo 's real name is Helmut Schlinker . He is Gunther 's age , has been one of his assistants for thirty-two years , and had a tender hand in raising Gunther 's son , Buffy . Piccolo is a partly bald dwarf who likes loud Floridian shirts and drinks Budweiser beer , preferably Light . He dismisses us curtly . " I do n't talk today , " he says . His face is an alarming shade of gray-brown , and he is smoking furiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concrete , orders his lion into an individual cage that adjoins the big one , and a roustabout immediately slams its sliding door shut . Only then can Gunther take time to greet us . He extends a hand through the bars of the big cage as if it were the most natural thing in the world to do , and clasps ours in a stevedore 's handshake , which he accompanies with a brilliant smile . He turns to Piccolo : " Who needs the smoke ? " And then back to us : " In thirty-two years , this little person has never been late . " A black Morgan is brought into the ring . Two roustabouts are trying to fit it with a caparison of heavy leather . They adjust the headpiece , but they have trouble with the cushion blanket . Gunther , watching them , explains , " You have to be careful , so the horse never gets hurt . " Suddenly , he flies out the door of the cage , lands under the belly of the horse , fastens a reluctant buckle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , good-naturedly , " I do all the work around here . " ( Actually , he has thirty-two people working under him . ) The caparisoned horse is led into the cage by a roustabout and followed by Edling . Piccolo hands Gunther a collar and leash through the bars . Juliette is brought in , and Gunther , on one knee , fastens the collar around her neck . Juliette cowers and snarls , but Gunther reassures her . Then , slowly , patiently , endlessly , Juliette , obeying commands , jumps onto the moving horse , rides on it for a moment , and jumps off . With infinite patience , Gunther repeats , over and over , " Easy . Get up . Good . Good . That 's the idea " ? until , unexpectedly , as Juliette is in midair , about to land on the horse 's hack , the Morgan rears violently , neighing . Juliette lands on the ground , where she crouches , stunned , stilled , frightened , and stumped . Gunther throws his arms up . " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse with Mousie  --  my poodle , Mousie  --  and the horse was afraid of Mous ; e . Bring on the little guy . " Juliette exits , and a tiger cub five or six months old enters the cage . His name is Bengal . His fur is silken , his stripes are bright , his paws are fat and round , and his bushy , stiff white whiskers tremble in the light . He rolls onto his back , shows a warm-looking furry white belly , and then sits up , looking at Gunther . " Schatz ! " Gunther exclaims fondly , and buries a hand in his fur . " Bring on the other guys , " he says , vigorously stroking Bengal 's head , so that the ears are pulled back , and Bengal 's expression , positively joyous to begin with , grows almost manic . Two older tigers , Natasha and King , rush in . They are ten months old . They fall on Bengal with growls of joy , and then the three of them take off . Now from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paws stamping on concrete ; a heavy , musky floating smell of jungle ; and an incessant , happy roar , Bengal , on his back , and in an access of tenderness , grabs Gunther by the right leg and starts chewing on the denim . This lasts until Gunther picks him up by the tail and deposits him between Natasha and King . The tigers play for close to ten minutes while Gunther monitors them with a smile and an occasional reprimand . Then he picks Bengal up by the scruff of the neck . Natasha and King , exhausted , roll onto their backs , " Enough ! " Gunther says . The practice session is over . Everyone has left . We are alone in the arena with Gunther , the two of us sitting side by side on a crate . ( Like his animals , he very rarely sits still . ) " It will he the same in Florida , " he says , " except that for one week I can come home at six in the evening , like a normal man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is winter quarters for the circus . Gunther owns a house there , and a gold Rolls-Royce , which the beauteous Sigrid , his wife , can be seen driving in the mornings . Sigrid has a Liberty-horse act . They will stay in Venice for three or four weeks ; then it 's back on the road and fifteen-hour days . " I swam only twice in our pool last year , " he says . " Too tired . Buffy is doing well in school . Very well . " Buffy is now thirteen and , as Mark Oliver Gebel , shares a billy-goat act with Michelle Antalek , whose parents have a chimpanzee act . " Tina is twenty-one . Would you believe it ? " Tina , Gunther 's lissome stepdaughter , has a Russian-wolfhound act . " I live for training , " Gunther says . " Animals go through stages , like kids . At first , the kid is not afraid of the water . He jumps into the pool . " Here Gunther jumps up and begins to mime . " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of the water . And the little guy : I start training when he 's about fifteen months ; he likes me . Then , one day , he thinks , Hey , maybe this guy tastes good ! " Gunther sits down . " Fifteen years here in America , can you believe it ? " He sits still for a second , his hands in his lap , palms up , and , inevitably , we catch sight of the crisscross , complicated grid of delicate , pallid scars on the inside of his forearms . " Sometimes it 's all for nothing . One of the black Morgans died . Last year , I had a tiger with asthma . It was terrible . Terrible ! " Here he jumps up and mimes the tiger wheezing his lungs out . " Something new ! Always something new ! Maybe we have a lion act in the ring in two years . " Herb Garden WHEN midtown Manhattan begins to feel like the access route for the entire population of the Middle Atlantic states , as it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year 's tumult threatens a winter-long implosion of the human spirit , there is a ninety-cent solution we heartily recommend : Take the A train up to Fort Tryon Park just after the morning rush hour , crunch along a delightfully depopulated path of fallen leaves that leads to the Cloisters , and drop anchor for a moment in the Bonnefont Cloister herb garden . This square plot of earth , tucked within a low-walled veranda on a perch several hundred feet above the Hudson River , offers a painterly perspective of the river , the condominium-free portion of the Jersey Palisades , and the George Washington Bridge , steely and clean in the distance . Surrounded by this view one bright and brisk morning , and pondering the variety of aromas that rise up from the hundreds of species of plants at our feet , we felt as though we had discovered the coordinates of a quieter civilization , which had somehow escaped the influence of the 100 Zip Code network . After a few minutes of peaceful soli-tude , we were joined in the garden by a young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outermost a rugby-style knit with an upturned col-lar , and was carrying a bucket of white and red roses in one hand and a watering can in the other . Her hands were reddened by the wet and the cold , and she had a dappled , pinkish com-plexion ; her hair , straight and fine and blond , was either windblown or tucked into her shirt collar ; she stood a bit flat-footed and workmanlike ; and she had blue eyes that spoke of a shy and deferential manner . We quickly learned that we were meeting Susan Leach , the horticulturist of all the Cloisters ' gardens and the person most directly responsible for the creation and maintenance of the herb garden . She told us that she had just finished decorating an indoor garden that had been re-created from late-medieval paintings on the theme of the Ma-donna in a rose arbor , and that it had not been an easy job . " Trying to interpret the art is very hard , because certain flowers and plants were depicted in medieval paintings solely for the sake of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance " ? she pointed to her buck-et of roses ? " are rep-resentative of the Vir-gin , but it 's doubtful whether they were origi-nally part of the actual gardens being painted , because you see com-binations of plants in the paintings that flow-er in different seasons . Though they have been rendered beautifully and truly , the scene is not naturalistic . That is why I like it here . " She " It 's Mr. Bochild , from upstairs , wanting to know when in blue blazes you 're going to go out and build your snowman. " was referring to the herb garden . " I like these growing plants set in a functional design with respect to who 's going to look best next to whom  --  without overburdening their simple nature . It 's because of their simple nature that plants normally found in the wild can be transplanted here . " We asked Susan Leach how she had gone about choosing the wide variety of plants in the herb garden . " Come with me , " she said , and we followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrance to the garden . " The objective was to re-create an authentic medieval herb garden , so we began with Charlemagne 's list , " she said . pulling out from her shelves a translation of " Capitulare de Villis vel Curtis Imperialibus " ( " Directives for the Administration of Imperial Courts or Estates " ) . " From this list , we got about a hundred of the plants . The rest were found in herbals pub lished either before or during the Middle Ages . " She showed us facsimiles of three such publications : " Tacuinum Sanitatis ; " a Greek herbal by Dioscorides ; and " Hortulus , " a translation by Raef Payne of a long poem written in the ninth century by the abbot of a Swiss monastery named Walahfrid the Squint-Eyed . " His is a very sensitive account of how to take care of a garden , " she said of the abbot 's poem . She showed us a passage that she said she found particularly inspiring . It read ; Then my small patch was warmed by winds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should not be washed away , we faced it with planks and raised it in oblong beds a little above the level ground .... Then come the showers of spring , from time to time watering OUT tiny crop , and in its turn the gentle moon caresses the delicate leaves . " The herb garden is simple , it 's delicate , it 's fragrant , and , beyond the aesthetics , there is history and lore at tached to each plant that can teach you a lot , " she said . " Many of these plants have multiple uses  --  medicinal , culinary , aromatic , and so on . " Susan Leach excused herself for a moment , and we wandered out to the garden again , paying closer attention this time to the plants , which were labelled with their Latin and common names . We recognized familiar names like lemon thyme and sweet basil , marjoram and caraway , and noted the names of herbs we had never heard of , such as midsummer men , live-forever , rocket , and Good-KingHenry . When Susan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a plant that had low , muted-green leaves and was growing a little taller and bushier than some of its neighbors . " That 's a wallflower , " she said , with a smile , " Wallflowers are beautiful in spring . "
