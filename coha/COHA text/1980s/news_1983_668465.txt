The Cook County Democratic Party organization , once omnipotent but now in considerable decline , seems to be prepared tomorrow to devote most of whatever clout it still has to the heretical goal of electing the first Republican mayor this city has had since William Hale ( Big Bill ) Thompson left office in 1931 . Chicago never has been faced with a clear-cut , two-party race between a white and a black before , and for most of the 50 Democratic ward committeemen , the choice has come down to which candidate they think will do them the least harm : the black Democrat , Harold Washington , who has already given them the back of his hand , or the white - though rival - Republican , Bernard Epton , who speaks not of abolishing patronage , only of curtailing its abuses . Many of the mostly white ward leaders have assumed contorted positions , in what Washington has referred to as the " double-edge " phenomonon , so as to balance their desire to remain Democrats in good standing with their obvious hope that Epton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Epton , and most , if not all , of the 16 black committeemen support Washington , the rest have adopted variations on both themes , including : Those who remain neutral and do nothing to stem the strong late surge for Epton in their white , ethnic neighborhoods ; those who nominally have endorsed Washington but are secretly working for Epton ; and those who are mounting lukewarm efforts to help Washington by asking some of their constituents to stay at home tomorrow rather than vote for Epton . The committemen ' s disarray reflects the bitterness , fear and racism that have permeated this mayoral campaign like no other in this city , which is 40 percent black . They acknowledge that race has become the overwhelming factor in the campaign and that neither candidate , ever aware of each other ' s base , has done much to dispel that . There is Epton , with his slogan to vote for him " before it ' s too late , " and Washington , with remarks like , " We have given the white candidates our votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . It ' s our turn . It ' s our turn . " Most of the committeemen who are supporting Epton take the position that they are powerless to do anything else , given the overwhelming support for the Republican in their white ethnic wards . " I had my precinct captains take a survey of the 32,000 voters in our ward a few weeks ago and a very large majority were for Epton , " said Edmund Kelly , the city park superintendent and 47th ward committeeman who was the first toannounce for Epton . " The message to me was , Please tell Ed not to tell us to vote for Harold Washington . ' " Washington has said that if he is elected he would move to end patronage . In part , the Washington campaign was born of a crusade to rid this city of a system that blacks say has rewarded them with crumbs in return for Democratic loyalty . Washington has made few overtures to the Democratic establishment for support - a snub not lost on committeemen like Kelly , who are wary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rivals . " He never called , never sent a note , " Kelly said yesterday of Washington . " You ' ve got to be stupid to take that stuff , not if you have any guts . " Alderman Edward Burke , the committeman for the 14th ward in Southwest Chicago , another white ethnic stronghold , is officially neutral but openly critical of Washington . " It ' s unfortunate that the Democratic nominee is a person of Harold ' s background , " Burke said , referring to Washington ' s failure to file federal income tax returns for four years , his suspension from practicing law for failing to serve clients and his failure to pay various small bills . Burke added that he thought several other prominent Chicago blacks would have been more " electable . " " It would be fair to say that there ' s nothing I could do to get Washington any votes , " Burke said . " You have to understand that people in my ward are about 94 percent white . Most of them have already moved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . They are homeowners who have all their equity tied up in their homes , and they have lost money when they had to move from their previous homes . . . They are now afraid of what a black mayor might mean to the city of Chicago - an end to the system as they know it . They have been comfortable in what could be called ethnic enclaves . " Burke , who predicted a 52-48 win for Epton tomorrow , said he sees this election as a one-time-only Republican aberration , and that virtually all those who vote for Epton will return to the Democratic fold in the future . " We ' re all for Epton , " one Northwest Side Democratic worker , whose committeeman is nominally for Washington , was quoted as saying yesterday . " This is more than an election . We ' re fighting for everything we have this time . " John Merlo , the 44th ward committeeman , one of several relatively liberal districts along Chicago ' s Lakefront which are expected to be pivotal , said he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state Legislature for 16 years , and because I ' m a Democrat . That ' s most important . " However , he said that if he presided over a ward like Kelly ' s or Burke ' s where the sentiment was overwhelmingly for Epton , he probably would endorse the Republican , too , while saying he intended personally to vote for Washington . " It depends on the geographical area you represent , " he said . Despite his efforts and those of his precinct captains , Merlo said he thinks Epton will carry the 44th ward by 3000 votes . Another Lakefront ward committeeman and Washington supporter , George Dunne , who is former chairman of the Cook County Democratic Party , predicted in a television interview yesterday that Epton would carry his ward as well . The current Cook County chairman , Edward Vrodolyak , publicly predicts a Washington victory but has been quoted as saying privately that he feels Epton will win the election by 30,000 votes . The degree of Vrodolyak ' s support for Washington has often been questioned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Notre Dame audience that life in Chicago is " going to be hell no matter who wins . This is a racial election . What makes this race different is race . " Meanwhile yesterday , Washington , speaking on the ABC television program " This Week with David Brinkley , " continued his criticism of the local Democratic establishment , saying it " feared I will bring sanity ( to the system and Mr. Kelly could no longer run his feudal barony . " And on the NBC television program " Meet the Press , " Washington accused the party leaders of " trying to destroy my campaign . " Epton withdrew from his scheduled appearance on " Meet the Press " because , a spokesman said , one of the panelists was a Washington supporter . Judy Knapton , Epton ' s press secretary , said the candidate objected to the presence of panelist Vernon Jarrett , a columnist for the Chicago Tribune , and asked that he be replaced . NBC declined . Epton , commenting on the Brinkley program about the racism that has affected the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum rap . We ' ve lived in peace and harmony for many years . . . The electronic media has taken a few isolated incidents and blown them all out of proportion . " Turning directly to the camera , Epton added , " You invented it . "
