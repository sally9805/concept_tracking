Call it the Great Impostor . Like rheumatoid arthritis , it painfully inflames knees and ankles . Sometimes it masquerades as heart disease , provoking arrhythmias so severe that a pacemaker may be required . It can strike the brain , inciting blinding headaches , memory lapses and even chronic depression . Muscular coordination can become so shaky that doctors suspect multiple sclerosis . Walt Dabney , 41 , of Herndon , Va. , suffered for more than two years with many of these symptoms and ran up $4,000 in medical bills before his problem was correctly diagnosed : he had Lyme disease , a bacterial infection spread by ticks . Says Dabney , chief ranger for the National Park Service : " I 'm convinced that a lot of people are being treated for arthritis when they 've been bitten by a tick . " <P> The difficulty of diagnosing the ailment was a prominent topic last week at the third international conference on Lyme disease , in New York City . A second worrisome theme : the prevalence of the infection , not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , but across the country and around the world . Researchers reported that the disease has now been found in at least 32 states and six continents , in part because doctors have become more adept at diagnosing it . Since 1980 there have been nearly 6,000 officially recorded cases in the U.S. , but experts say the actual number is far higher . " If it were n't for AIDS , " says Microbiologist Russell Johnson of the University of Minnesota , " it would be the No. 1 new disease facing us today . " <P> Symptoms of Lyme disease were described in Europe a century ago , but it was not until 1975 that Rheumatologist Allen Steere , then at Yale , made sense of the malady . Steere investigated a group of children , in and around Lyme , Conn. , who were suffering from a mysterious form of arthritis . He traced the outbreak to speck-size ticks of the genus Ixodes , carried mainly by mice and deer . In 1982 federal researchers isolated the culprit from the tick : a corkscrew-shaped bacterium , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> For about 70% of victims , the first sign is a rash that often looks like a bull's-eye  --  white in the center and red on the outside . It erupts up to a month after the tick bite , and is sometimes accompanied by fever , stiffness and extreme lethargy . At this stage , the infection is easily cured with common antibiotics , like tetracycline . Left untreated , however , more serious symptoms may develop as the spirochete makes its way into the brain ( 18% of cases ) , the joints ( 57% ) or the heart ( 10% ) . Correctly diagnosed , even these complications can usually be reversed with large doses of antibiotics . <P> Efforts to contain Lyme disease are under way . In an attempt to disrupt the tick 's life cycle , Harvard researchers have developed cardboard tubes containing insecticide-treated cotton that attract nesting mice and keep them bug-free . Meanwhile , work has begun on a vaccine and a urine test that may provide earlier diagnosis than the current blood test .
