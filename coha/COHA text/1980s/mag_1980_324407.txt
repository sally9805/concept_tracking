The campaign produces more invective than serious debate <P> It had been billed as Das Duell ( The Duel ) , and it was expected that the West German election campaign pitting Chancellor Helmut Schmidt against Conservative Challenger Franz Josef Strauss would be a stimulating confrontation of intellects and ideologies . Instead , halfway to the Oct. 5 election , it has been a disappointment , practically devoid of serious debate on the issues and degenerating easily into mudslinging and character assassination . The battle seems to be all over but the invective : Schmidt 's coalition of Social Democrats and Free Democrats is a heavy favorite to defeat the Christian Democrats and their sister party , Strauss 's Christian Social Union . <P> Last week , in one of the rare surprises of the campaign , the country 's Roman Catholic bishops got into the act with a hortatory pastoral letter intended to be read in their churches on Sunday . Without naming a candidate or party , the letter inveighed against the expanding role of the state , the burgeoning federal bureaucracy and the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bishops also criticized Schmidt 's government for making divorce and abortion too easy . While denying undue influence , the church , which is especially strong in Strauss 's native Bavaria , thus appeared to be intervening in an effort to shore up Strauss 's fortunes . Schmidt was predictably furious . Said he : " Politics from the pulpit is an abomination ! " <P> Otherwise , the campaign has turned almost entirely on the candidates ' personalities . Schmidt has capitalized on his basic popularity-60% of the electorate currently approve of his performance as Chancellor-and on his image as a nearly ideal embodiment of the leadership qualities West Germans seek : confidence , firmness and statesmanship-not to mention telegenic good looks . In campaign speeches to large , lustily cheering crowds , he proudly points to the country 's healthy economy , its fervent commitment to detente , and its enhanced international stature . Strauss , he warns , would " squander " these hard-won achievements . <P> By contrast , Strauss 's image is his biggest liability and provokes intense reactions . Beloved in Bavaria , the heartland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often detested nearly everywhere else . A highly intelligent man who was an exceedingly capable Defense and Finance Minister , he is nonetheless regarded as a hard-lining cold warrior . His bulldog appearance is caricatured almost daily . His rallies are beset by hecklers who hurl rotten eggs and tomatoes . Strauss 's efforts to improve his image have backfired , leaving an impression of uncertainty and artificiality rather than statesmanship.
