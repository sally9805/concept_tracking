Maybe loves merry-go-rounds is more accurate . And one in particular : old No. 33 , manufactured by the Philadelphia Toboggan Company in 1914 . With a generous 50-foot diameter , four rows of hand-carved , jumping horses ( 68 in all , with their original paint ) , and a fast , silky smooth ride , it ' s the stuff of a carousel-lover ' s dream. // That might help explain why for the last 10 months Mr. Boehm has virtually ignored his typesetting business and , together with his wife , devoted himself to saving No. 33 , known hereabouts as ' ' the state fair carousel. ' ' // // Nov. 11 , 1988 , was a pivotal day in Peter Boehm ' s life . That ' s when a local newspaper printed a story saying that 20 horses from the 74-year-old carousel would be auctioned off in New York the following month. // Mr. Boehm and his wife , Nancy Peterson , were appalled . Boehm had been taking his daughter , Abby , to the state fair for a dozen years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' I was just one of those people who came ( to the fair ) each year and rode it , ' ' he says. // Little by little , the couple ' s interest grew . Nancy latched onto a book about hand-carved carousels , titled ' ' Painted Ponies . ' ' On a family trip to Boston , they used a list in the book to visit six of the 10 operating carousels along the way . In a Hershey , Pa. , museum , they admired an exhibit of carousel horses. // Then came the news of their own hometown carousel ' s imminent demise . ' ' Nancy said , ' This is really terrible . Somebody ought to do something , ' ' ' recalls Boehm. // Before long , Peter and Nancy realized that the ' ' somebody ' ' would have to be they. // The first step was to form a nonprofit corporation , Our Fair Carousel , dedicated to preserving the merry-go-round and finding a permanent home where it could continue to operate . They drew up a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper columnist jumped on the bandwagon , and volunteers began to call , asking what they could do to help . Boehm contacted the carousel ' s owner . Yes , he would sell if Boehm could raise the money in time - a little over $1 million would do. // But where would the money come from , especially with only about four weeks left before the auction date ? // Then St. Paul city council member Tom Dimond stepped in . He sponsored a resolution in the council that , in essence , authorized city funds to guarantee a loan to Boehm ' s group . The due date : the end of 1989. // ' ' We got together , along with other groups , and put together a package which the city guaranteed , ' ' says Mr. Dimond . It ' s been a community effort in which many other individuals and businesses have played essential roles , too , he points out . ' ' Peter put together the fund-raising . He ' s worked very hard. ' ' // Armed with his new financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the entire carousel just before it was auctioned . Some in the local press cheered , but others questioned the city council ' s judgment . Could a merry-go-round possibly be worth $1 million ? Should a city in need of better streets and sewers and snow-plowing spend any money on a project like this ? // To Boehm , the answer is ' ' no . ' ' He wants private funds to pay 100 percent of the cost of saving the carousel . ' ' What the city ( loan ) gave us was time , ' ' he says . According to Boehm ' s latest reckoning , Our Fair Carousel has raised pledges to cover $900 , 000 of the $1. 3 million he needs to pay off the loan . ( Of the total , $600 , 000 is in the form of an as-yet-anonymous pledge . ) If he fails to raise the money , ownership reverts to the city council , which has declared its willingness to auction off the carousel. // During the recently concluded Minnesota State Fair , 107 , 000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , an increase of more than 20 , 000 over last year , says Boehm. // But the key to completing the fund-raising , he says , is an ' ' Adopt-A-Pony ' ' plan that allows sponsors , most likely corporations , to underwrite individual horses ( a plaque with the donor ' s name will be attached to each horse ) . The prices range from $5 , 000 for an inner-row horse to $25 , 000 for the outer ring . So far , 10 horses have been ' ' adopted , ' ' including a ' ' people ' s pony ' ' paid for by the many small donations that have come in. // Boehm wants to place the carousel in Town Square Park , a mall in downtown St. Paul . He reasons that it ' s climate-controlled ( that ' s why he ' s ruled out the fairgrounds , city parks , and the Como Zoo ) , has 24-hour security , and would mean the carousel could be operated year-round. // Why let kids with dirty shoes and sticky fingers ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual works of art ( see accompanying story ) ? // ' ' There ' s no point in saving a merry-go-round that doesn ' t work as a merry-go-round , ' ' he says firmly . Instead of dollar figures , he sees children of all ages enjoying the fantasy of a carousel ride. // ' ' Down here , we only have children ' s tickets , ' ' he said as the carousel whirled nearby at the recent state fair . Many of the riders were grownups ; some couples held hands as they rode . ' ' One 86-year-old woman got up and rode a horse , ' ' he said . ' ' She told me : ' My friends think I ' m crazy , but I ' ve never felt so alive. ' ' ' // ' ' Peter Boehm is one of the most shining examples of anyone I ' ve ever met ' ' who loves merry-go-rounds , says Arthur Curtze , the founder of Brass Ring Trust , a State College , Pa. , group dedicated to saving antique carousels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be done. ' ' // Mr. Curtze spent several days this summer in St. Paul preparing the carousel to kick up its heels in a final state fair fling . He rates it among ' ' the top 40 or 50 ' ' antique carousels in the country , he said in a telephone interview . And because it was used only a few days each year for the fair , it ' ' runs just like new . ' ' Not only is it safe , says Curtze , it ' s fast . Add to that the fact that every horse is a ' ' jumper ' ' ( moves up and down ) , and riding it is something special. // Meanwhile , Barbara Mintz , one of the owners of Guernsey ' s , the New York auction house that sold Boehm the carousel , says she ' d be ' ' thrilled ' ' to buy it back anytime . Customers are waiting in the wings , she says . ' ' The city council could definitely get its money back - and more ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Her auction house , which specializes in collectibles , plans to gavel off three other carousels on Dec. 18 - either together or as individual pieces. // Can Boehm raise the money in time ? ' ' I ' d say I have a 50-50 chance , ' ' he says . ' ' I think it ' s going to go down to the wire . ' ' But in December , he muses , at the last moment , maybe on nearly the last day , ' ' someone ' s going to get in the Christmas spirit ' ' and put him over the top. // Carousel expert Curtze seems more sanguine . ' ' I have no doubt he ' ll raise the money , ' ' he says . ' ' The ( carousels ) I worry about are . . . in cities where nobody cares. . . // ' ' Peter Boehm did his homework , ' ' says Curtze , who is quietly helping other groups around the country in the process of saving antique merry-go-rounds . Boehm may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curtze , but ' ' he ' s one of the best I ' ve ever seen . He always knows when to ask for help. // ' ' That ' s why he got a contribution from Brass Ring Trust .
