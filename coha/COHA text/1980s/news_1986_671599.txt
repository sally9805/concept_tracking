The sensational Rangers , who until just weeks ago had no grand immediate future , are the champions of the Patrick Division and will now be one of hockey ' s final four. // In a frenzied Madison Square Garden , in front of 17 , 367 overjoyed fans , the Rangers defeated the Washington Capitals , 2-1 , last night and won their second-round playoff series , four games to two. // This team , which barely made it into the postseason , suddenly discovered a whole new self come playoff time , one that caught the Capitals , the clear favorites , off guard . And last night they did it stylishly. // Pierre Larouche scored two of the prettiest goals of the season and John Vanbiesbrouck , the young goalie , again supplied the backbone. // It was a loud night at the Garden . The crowd came in screaming , and they were still going at it 15 minutes after the Rangers had left for their locker room , chanting " Let ' s Go Rangers " and still tossing confetti. // Vanbiesbrouck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene , thrust his stick up high to the crowd as he departed under the stands . He said later that it was a way of telling the fans that this phenomenon would not stop here. // On Thursday night , the Rangers will open the four-of-seven-game third-round series in Montreal or Hartford . The Whalers beat the Canadiens last night , 1-0 , forcing a seventh game in their series. // " It was the most emotional moment in the 22 years I ' ve been alive , " Vanbiesbrouck said of the Ranger victory . " It was bedlam. " // " For once , I don ' t feel that we don ' t belong , " said Mike Allison. // " No one thought we would do this , " said Don Maloney . " The press didn ' t . The fans didn ' t . We didn ' t . Now I guess we ' ve convinced ourselves. " // Larouche , with Mike Ridley assisting each time , scored in the first period and again in the second , and then endured with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5 minutes 38 seconds of the final period . But the Rangers held to their tight , conservative plan . The Capitals were left scurrying as the Rangers controlled the play to the last buzzer. // Thus , 22 days after the Rangers clinched fourth place and a position in the playoffs , another incredible achievement was theirs . They finished with the 14th-best record in the league , two games under . 500 with only 78 points . They eliminated the Flyers , the second-best team , who had 110 points , in five games , and then fell behind the Capitals , the third-best team with 107 points , by two games to one . What is more , the Rangers lost by whopping scores , 8-1 and 6-3. // But they won in overtime for the second time in the series on Wednesday night , and won , 4-2 , in Landover , Md. , last Friday night. // Their following , which has been waiting and pleading for a Stanley Cup for 46 years , grew larger and more feverish . The Rangers , for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . They lost that year to the Islanders in four straight . They last reached the finals in 1979 , when they lost to Montreal in five games. // Everybody , it seemed , wanted in on this one . Out on Seventh Avenue before the game , the scalpers were getting as much as $125 for red seats , the best in the house , normally priced at $28 . There were vendors selling balloons and pennants and cotton candy . It was a lovely spring night and the Rangers had taken over this town. // When the little door along the boards opened at center ice , indicating that the Rangers were about to appear , these fans went wild , setting a new record at the Garden for beginning the hysteria early . They kept it up of course through " The Star Spangled Banner " and through the opening minutes. // Again , as they had on Friday night , the fans taunted Pete Peeters , the Capitals ' goalie by mournfully chanting his name , " Pee-ters , Pee-ters . " And it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a 1-0 lead , with 7 minutes 24 seconds remaining in the first period , on a dazzling play. // Mike Ridley carried the puck to the Capitals ' blue line . He wiggled to his right . The defenseman Greg Smith moved that way . Ridley kept his stick in his left hand outstretched , and then he pulled out an old ice pond move , putting the puck through Smith ' s legs. // " It was more of a I-don ' t-want-to-get-hit move , " said Ridley. // Apparently , he had hastened his movements because he thought that the other defenseman back , Rod Langway , was going to make a run at him . Langway did , but Ridley breezed by him. // That left Ridley with the puck , Larouche to his left , and for the Capitals , Peeters in his crouch. // Ridley waited a few seconds before he passed and once Larouche got it , he hesitated some more , almost too long . He might be the one of the most gifted hockey players when it comes to deking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boundaries of his shooting touch when he moved past the right circle , and almost beyond the goal itself . It seemed that in the process he had lost his angle. // " I thought I went too far , " he said later. // It looked as if he were trying to prove that Pierre Larouche and only Pierre Larouche could make such a shot from such a difficult angle . Finally , he lifted the puck over Peeters ' s right shoulder Larouche had his seventh playoff goal , marking the sixth time in the playoff games that he had scored the first Ranger goal . That is why around the Ranger lockerroom he is now known as the fire starter. // That was the early highlight , and Vanbiesbrouck took over. // In chronological order : After 1 minute 47 seconds of the second period , Mike Gartner broke in . Vanbiesbrouck went down and managed to stop the shot with his right knee . Bobby Carpenter swept up the rebound . Vanbiesbrouck , who was still off-balanced , got his foot on the shot. // At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close-in shot by Carpenter with his right foot . Carpenter had a portion of the net open . His followup shot this time hit off the left post and skidded through the crease . Carpenter was still shaking his head about 30 seconds later , staring out in obvious disbelief. // At 5 : 57 , Vanbiesbrouck put out his left arm and stopped a shot from Gartner , who had broken in two-on-one with Carpenter. // With three minutes to go in the second period , he stopped Scott Stevens with his right foot . The frustrated Stevens brought his stick across the goalie ' s chest and sent him sprawling into the net . Stevens was called for crosschecking. // Then Larouche , with Ridley again , struck on the power play after 34 seconds of the third period . Wilf Paiment , to the extreme right of the goal , shot the puck toward Peeters . The puck kicked around and came to Ridley , stationed near the corner of the crease , to the right of Peeters . His pass across the crease nicked off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flagged it down with his right hand , put the puck on the ice and sent it through the wickets of Peeters. // " There is nothing wrong with what we did on the ice , " said the Capitals ' Langway . And then referring to the last few years in which the Capitals haven risen to prominence in the league , he said , " You don ' t build to a championship in four years. " // Incredibly , these Rangers may be showing that it is possible to do just that in a matter of weeks. //
