Terrorism in the Andes <P> The inhabitants of the rugged village of Santiago de Lucanamarca were preparing to celebrate Easter Sunday with music and drink . But all of a sudden about 30 masked men , brandishing axes and hatchets , swarmed into the dusty Andean settlement , setting fire to the municipal hall and pillaging local shops . As the terrified residents scrambled for cover , the intruders rounded up scores of villagers , including wizened old women and barefoot children , and proceeded to stone , hack and shoot many of them to death . After less than two hours , the attackers vanished back into the hills , leaving at least 66 corpses in their wake . <P> The massacre was a direct affront to the liberal government of Peru 's President , Fernando Belande Terry . Ever since Belande 's election in 1980 , the Sendero Luminoso ( Shining Path ) , a shadowy group of self-styled Maoist guerrillas , has tyrannized the area around the picturesque Andean town of Ayacucho , some 350 miles southeast of Lima . Under the pretext of defying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police stations and assassinated villagers suspected of informing against them . In January , Belande sent a 3,500-man task force to Ayacucho to deter the rebels . But the guerrillas continue to pick off their enemies . In he past three years 545 people have been killed in the fighting . <P> Why the most recent attack ? Probably because elders from Lucanamarca traveled 90 miles to Ayacucho last month to petition the government for police protection against the Senderistas . Nothing came of the appeal except savage retribution from the very men the villagers feared . Sums up Enrique Zileri Gibson , director of Lima 's leading newsmagazine , Caretas : " It is a strategy of terror designed to show the weakness of the army . " <P> Founded in the early 1970s , Sendero Luminoso claims as many as 1,000 members , most of them peasants and students from the mountains . Their eccentric ideology is mingled with a curious form of messianic tribalism . The Senderistas use Inca slingshots , for example , to fling dynamite sticks at targets . The guerrillas ' atavistic tactics have evoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists were killed near Ayacucho in January , a government commission concluded that villagers had perpetrated the crime using Senderista methods . The bodies of the newsmen were carefully stripped , washed and turned face down , while their clothes were burned , in accordance with the traditional rites of Andean exorcism . The investigating commission called attention to a fundamental difference between " a Western judicial system and another-archaic , traditional , hidden and sometimes in conflict with the other-which rules the lives and customs of the high Andes . " <P> Such hoary superstitions do not seem to interest Belande . The President wrote off the Easter massacre as " an insanity perpetrated by people who are psychologically unhinged . " Although he has deployed his troops , Belaunde will need a more detailed and determined policy if he is to save Andean villagers from their ruthless oppressors.
