By late Thursday , the main question seemed to be not the shape of such a plan , but the pace at which the talks ' Syrian stage managers would decide to unfurl it and the amount of rival rhetoric or histrionics they will tolerate. // But given the depth of substantive differences here , 11th-hour hitches could not be ruled out . Even the Syrians must realize that only the wildest optimist can assume that an accord on issues that have fueled nine years of civil war will stick. // Also , only the talks ' proud Swiss hosts would seriously contend - as a local newspaper did Thursday - that the ' ' tranquil charm ' ' of Lake Geneva explains the civil behavior of Lebanon ' s rivals toward each other . Kiss the hand you can not bite , goes a Lebanese political maxim . But in the past , the rivals have shown a grisly staying power , eventually biting hands once pragmatically kissed. // Still , the consensus among conference sources was that an accord on Lebanon ' s future was now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syria wants it and Syria can get it , ' ' said an aide to a Lebanese delegate , noting the ' ' crucial ' ' role of Syrian Vice-President Abdel Halim Khaddam , officially an ' ' observer ' ' here. // This was the general feeling here even after a brief walkout Thursday by former Lebanese President Sulei-man Franjieh on the issue of future ties with Israel. // And whatever the limitations of an eventual compromise , they need not minimize the Syrians ' accomplishments here - notably a cease-fire that , by Beirut standards , still holds . On Thursday , the delegates announced agreement to order the release of all those detained or kidnapped by the Lebanese militias in the civil strife. // A political accord would add cement to the cease-fire . It will at least be more ambitious and substantive than its precursors , addressing the root issue of the balance of power between Lebanon ' s long-dominant Maronite Christians and a long-seething Muslim majority . The main thrust of the emerging compromise is to trim Maronite power in favor of the Muslims , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maronite militia chiefs want to limit this process by creating a ' ' federation ' ' in Lebanon giving as much autonomy as possible to Christian areas . The main opposition warlords - the Shiite and Druze delegation chiefs - demand full secularization of a Lebanese political system that now allots specific positions on the basis of religion. // The effect would be a wholesale transfer of authority from the Maronites to the Muslims , beginning within six months , according to a joint Muslim-Druze position paper leaked to the press here. // Neither side will entirely get its way . ' ' Everyone knows , or at least assumes , Syria will impose a platform between the two extremes , ' ' said a Lebanese Muslim source , ' ' and that the Syrians already know almost exactly what shape the compromise will take. ' ' // Most sources seem to assume the result will be something like a proposal made last month by Lebanon ' s President , Amin Gemayel , a Maronite who has aligned himself with the Syrians as a ' ' co-mediator ' ' rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Sources near the President say that an accord will likely include : // // * Creation of a senate , expanding and diluting a current one-house chamber that is automatically dominated by the Maronites. // // * Limiting the powers of the president , who currently must be a Maronite , and expanding those of the Sunni Muslim premier . The premier , currently named by the president , would henceforth be chosen by the parliament . But most delegates believe the institution of the ' ' Maronite presidency ' ' will survive in some form. // // * Some move toward abolishing ' ' confessionalism ' ' - the practice of allocating political or civil-service posts on the basis of religion. // The sources said it was not clear how detailed an accord would be announced . They stressed that constitutionally , changes of the sort contemplated can be made formally only back in Beirut. // Also , the sources said some provision for political ' ' decentralization ' ' - while stopping short of Maronite demands - seemed likely . Among other moves said likely was to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s economic pie . Another probability : some collegial form of political direction for the armed forces to meet the opposition ' s objection to what they see as a transparently Maronite military. // But any accord could later face challenges by the Lebanese rivals , who are going along with Syria for reasons of vulnerability that may prove temporary . Other outsiders - Americans and Israelis - that previously balanced Syrian influence have curbed involvement. // Even if the Maronite-Muslim equation stays sorted out , there is much potential for trouble in rivalries within each religious group . On the Muslim side , at stake is the relative position of the Druzes , Sunnis , and Shiites - as well as the relative sway of moderates and Iranian-style militants among the Shiites . Among the Maronites , traditional dons like former President Camille Chamoun harbor enmity against the Phalangist forces of Pierre Gemayel , the President ' s father . At least as deep is the rift between Mr. Franjieh and the elder Gemayel , whom Franjieh holds responsible for a 1978 Phalangist attack that killed his son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could jockey for position by taking a more militant tack toward the Christians . The Christians could find two targets : Syria ' s 40 , 000 troops in Lebanon , or the Lebanese Muslims. // Yet the Syrians may be able to make an accord stick for some time - not , a Lebanese source says , ' ' by guaranteeing calm , but , literally , by imposing it. ' ' // This is doubtlessly in Syria ' s interest . Khaddam , sources say , has all but said so explicitly in closed sessions . Syria wants keenly to prove that where the Americans failed to achieve peace , Damascus can succeed. // //
