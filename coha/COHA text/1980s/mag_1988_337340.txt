The foreign invader wheeled into Brussels last week in a shiny black Mercedes and swept immediately into a jammed press conference . Wearing a gray pinstriped suit and smoking a thin cigar , Carlo De Benedetti , the Italian industrialist , began confidently . " Allow me to introduce myself , " he said . " I was born in Turin . I 'm 53 years old . I 'm not really sure where I live , but it 's somewhere between Turin , Milan and airplanes . " Then the high-flying entrepreneur proceeded to explain why he wanted to do what many proud Belgians viewed as the unthinkable , to gain control of Societe Generale de Belgique , their country 's largest and most pervasive company . His ambition : to assemble the first giant pan-European holding company that would prove big and diversified enough to compete head-on with American and Japanese rivals . <P> De Benedetti , who is chairman of Italy 's Olivetti and holds stakes in companies ranging from the Yves Saint Laurent fashion house to the Buitoni Perugina food giant , managed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Belgium Inc.  --  while no one was looking . His announcement last week that he had acquired an 18.6% share ( market value : more than $300 million ) largely through his Paris-based holding company , Cerus , prompted hurrahs in Italy 's financial community . " It was a brilliant operation , a theatrical coup , " said Fiat Chairman Giovanni Agnelli , and Italian newspapers bannered triumphant headlines like DE BENEDETTI , KING OF BELGIUM . But the cross-border bid stirred far noisier wails of protest across Belgium . " Financial piracy ! " declared La Generale 's chief , Rene Lamy . GENERALE UNDER THE ITALIAN BOOT , screamed a headline . <P> Perhaps too late , La Generale is putting up a defense . The company issued $1.5 billion in new stock , aiming to dilute the value of De Benedetti 's shares . A Brussels commercial court ruled the stock issue invalid , but the Belgian banking commission gave approval for the defense tactic , thus setting the stage for a legal and regulatory battle . Even Belgium 's Finance Minister , Mark Eyskens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reportedly said . " You can do it , but you ca n't do it sneakily , breaking in like a thief in the night . " In a hurriedly called meeting , Eyskens persuaded De Benedetti to limit his eventual share of La Generale to less than 25% , which will nonetheless give the Italian effective control over the company and with it a sizable chunk of the Belgian economy . <P> La Generale is part of Belgium 's bedrock . The company was founded by King William I of the Netherlands in 1822 , eight years before Belgium became an independent country . As the country 's first central bank , La Generale printed its own paper currency until 1850 . By the early 1900s , it was financing copper mining in the Belgian Congo ( now Zaire ) and the building of China 's Peking- Hankow railway . With its headquarters in a stately turn-of-the-century building situated between the royal palace and the Belgian Parliament , La Generale today employs nearly 100,000 workers and holds interests in 1,261 firms , including the country 's biggest banking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company has grown unfocused and stagnant , depressing its profits and market value .
