to consider yet another word that has been " Orwellianized " ? trivialized and generalized until it has come to mean almost the opposite of what it once meant . This is the word " utopian . " We tend to think of it as signifying an ideal that is commendable if not entirely realistic , a goal to aspire to , a vision of excellence that leads us , if not to the best , then at least to the better . It is a benign nominally for financial reasons ; but presumably he was upset both because the Board had passed a gay rights bill and because an antigay statewide proposition had been defeated . The day after he resigned , White changed his mind and asked to be reappointed . Milk opposed the request , and Mayor Moscone agreed . That day White committed the killings . The story is puzzling . It 's easy to understand how White crawled through an open window to avoid the metal detector at the City Hall front door , which would have caught his pistol and his extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office and fired several shots , he took time to reload his pistol , then walked down a long hall to Milk 's office . Did n't anyone hear those first shots ? Were there no assistants or secretaries outside the mayor 's private office ? How could there have been no interference in the time it took to reload and walk down the hall ? If there is evidence on these points , the film does n't include it . Nor does the film include much on White 's trial itself , in which he pleaded guilty by reason of diminished mental capacity , before and during the shootings , partly because of eating too much junk food . For the two killings , White was then sentenced to seven and a half years for involuntary manslaughter ( and was released after five years ) . One interviewee in the film says that if White had killed only Mayor Moscone , he would have been given a life term . This is not provable . Neither is it disprovable. and innocent image the word conjures up and a totally false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utopian impulse , the yearning for perfection that makes reality seem irredeemably flawed . In the face of so large a discrepancy between the ideal and the real , nothing less will suffice than a total transformation of reality ? of society , the polity , the economy , above all , of human nature . There are utopians and utopians , to be sure . The word " utopia " was first coined by Thomas More , who was perhaps the least utopian of them all . The title of his book , Utopia , gave notice that he was describing " no place , " that his visionary society was just that , an imaginary construct meant to dramatize ideas , not a blueprint for an ideal and potentially real society . And the other conspicuously Greek neologisms in this Latin book also testified to its fancifulness : the river Andryus meaning " hot water , " the philosopher Hythlodaeus , " dispenser of nonsense , " the magistrate Ademus , " not people . " Later utopians , products of the Enlightenment , were less modest than More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were confident that everything rational was realizable ; all that was needed was to conceive the good and will it into existence , or await its realization in the course of the necessary progress of history . Their utopias , so far from being located in a never-never world , were designed for a real place ( as in the communities of Fourier and Owen ) , a real time ( as in the historical schemes of Condorcet , Saint-Simon , and Comte ) , and real people ( as in Godwin 's species of totally rational human beings ) . W ILLIAM Godwin was perhaps the most ambitious utopian of all ? so ambitious that he would have spurned the label . He did not compose a prospectus for a new society nor an outline of the stages of history . Instead he presented his ideas in the form of a science of politics , from which he deduced principles which were absolutely valid and universally applicable , and which irrefutably demonstrated " the one best mode of social existence " for all of mankind . Published in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title , An Enquiry Concerning Political Justice , and its Influence on General Virtue and Happiness . Its basic premise was the perfectibility of mankind , the development of human beings who were , potentially , perfectly rational and moral and , therefore , perfectly free and equal . If perfectibility had so far eluded mankind , Godwin argued , it was only because of the corrupting and coercive effect of government . While monarchy was the worst form of government , it was not this or that form of government that was evil ; it was government as such . Even the most democratic government was unjust because its characteristic and commonly admired features ? the separation and balance of powers , representation , elections , voting , the ballot ? violated either reason or liberty or both . For the same reasons all the institutions created and sanctioned by government were unjust : constitutions , laws , courts , contracts , juries , punishments , prisons , private property , marriage , the family , religion , schools . And so , too , all collective or cooperative enterprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that required some form of organization , social clubs , musical concerts , theatrical performances . L BERATED from these oppressive and corrupting institutions , mankind would be rational and virtuous , free and equal . There would be no passion or prejudice to inhibit the intellect , no error or falsehood to stand in the way of truth , no self-love or self-interest to interfere with benevolence , no acquisitiveness or competitiveness to undermine equality , no coercion or cooperation to restrict individuality . Without marriage or any other contracts or promises to bind them to a future course of action ( " to disarm my future wisdom by my past folly " ) , individuals would be free and rational at every moment of their lives . And without families to divert them from their higher obligations , they would be free to devote themselves to humanity at large . Toward the end of the book , contemplating the inventions that would enable one man to do alone what now required the cooperative effort of many , thus doing away with the evil of " common labour " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since half an hour a day would suffice to provide all of a person 's needs ) , Godwin cited the " conjecture " of Benjamin Franklin that " mind would one day become omnipotent over matter . " That conjecture suggested to Godwin the bolder one that mind would become omnipotent over bodily matter as well . " If volition can now do something , why should it not go on to do still more and more ? " If it could cure all our social ills , why not our physical and mental ills ? And why should it not , finally , result in the " total extirpation of the infirmities of our nature " ? disease , sleep , languor , anguish , melancholy , resentment ? There was still another infirmity that would be extirpated once the omnipotence of mind established itself , andthat was sexuality . In the opening paragraph of the book , Godwin had asserted , as a self-evident principle , " that the happiness of the human species is the most desirable object for human science to promote ; and that intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those which are precarious and transitory . " By the end of the book it appeared that among the most precarious and transitory , and hence least desirable , pleasures were those of sex . " The tendency of a cultivated and virtuous mind is to render us indifferent to the gratification of sense , " and especially to sensory gratification of a " mere animal function . " Thus an enlightened mankind could look forward to the diminution and eventual elimination of sexuality . Lest this happy state of affairs result , as it inevitably would , in the depopulation of the earth , Godwin introduced an even bolder suggestion : that men might become immortal . He did not commit himself to immortality as a certainty , only as a real possibility ; what was certain was the infinite prolongation of life . It was this combination of celibacy and immortality , or near-immortality , that inspired the most memorable passage in the book , the image of a world in a permanent condition of perfection because it was in a permanent state of maturity . The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more extended population , will cease to propagate , for they will no longer have any motive , either of error or duty , to induce them . in addition to this they will perhaps be immortal . The whole will be a people of men , and not of children . Generation will not succeed generation , nor truth have in a certain degree to recommence her career at the end of every thirty years . After this Edenic vision of mankind purged of all the imperfections of human nature , to say nothing of all political and social evils , it was anticlimactic to be told that these were matters of " probable conjecture " which did not affect the truth of the " grand argument " of the rest of the book . This disclaimer , coming in the final sentence of the chapter , was too belated and too feeble to diminish the effect of the dramatic image of mankind in a perfect state of reason and virtue . Any resemblance between this Godwin and that presented in the biography by Peter H. Marshall is purely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quotations , are the same , but the totality is quite different . Marshall 's Godwin is no utopian but a philosopher and humanist on a par with " Hobbes , Locke , Rousseau and Mill . " And Political Justice , so far from being the work of an " idle visionary , " offers nothing more visionary than the idea that everyone is capable of improvement and that " education and enlightenment could bring about a better order of things on earth . " rr HE admiring biographer is not troubled by difficulties and inconsistencies that might occur to the ordinary reader of Godwin : the individual so solicitous of his own freedom that he can not commit himself to another in marriage , who is prepared to submerge his own self for the " love of my species " ; or a utilitarianism that deplores self-interest while placing the highest value on altruism ; or an altruism so suspicious of anything short of disinterested , universal benevolence that it would abolish the family itself ; or a hedonism that condemns sensuality and sexuality ; or a mechanistic philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to absolute truth at the expense of humaneness or even self-preservation ( a dying woman should be told the news of her husband 's death , and the " whitest " of lies is unjustified even to save one 's life ) ; or the renunciation of all forms of punishment on the grounds that there is no free will , hence no personal responsibility , hence no crime or guilt ( " the assassin can not help the murder he commits any more than the dagger " ) ; or a communism that eschews all forms of voluntary cooperation and all institutional mechanisms to ensure the equal distribution of property ; or a libertarianism that makes each individual the " ingenuous censor " of his neighbor by means of a moral suasion " not less irresistible than whips and chains " ; or a concept of " political justice " that does away with a need for any kind of polity or any administration of justice ; or a humanism that would like to " extirpate " much of human nature as we know it , including sex , emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect society it may not be known who the father of a child is , but such knowledge will he of " no importance . " ) To Marshall none of this is a serious problem , certainly not serious enough to detract from the claim that Godwin was a metaphysician , a psychologist , a political theorist , and a moral philosopher of the first order . Godwin 's vision of a " free and equal society , " we are told , derived from the " Greek notion of individual self-fulfillment " ? and was presumably superior to the Greek notion because it did not require anything as oppressive as the polis . He was said to have been a better utilitarian than Bentham ( because he had a more subtle idea of pleasure ) , and a better liberal than Mill ( because he carried liberalism to the point of anarchism ) . Like Rousseau , he was a humanist who wanted to produce " the whole person who would make the ideal society " ? a whole person unencumbered by sex or " personal affections , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , or families , indeed a society that was nothing more , Godwin said , than an " aggregation of individuals . " It is this Godwin who is recommended to us as peculiarly relevant today . " Above all , he speaks directly to the new radicalism which had emerged in the last decade which seeks a libertarian way between the bureaucratic centralism of Communist states and the organized lovelessness of the capitalist world . " One of the difficulties in this glowing account is the fact that in some measure it would seem to be belied by Godwin himself , who felt it necessary to make numerous changes in his work in later editions . These changes , he insisted , did not alter the basic thesis , but only clarified and improved it . Yet they inevitably call attention to some of the more dubious aspects of that thesis . Thus in the revised edition of 1796 , he reaffirmed the principle of perfectibility while stopping short of predicting , as part of that movement toward perfection , the elimination of sleep , disease , and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1798 even more than in the second ) his earlier condemnation of feelings , private affections , and sensual pleasures , and even conceded that marriage , while still the " worst " ( no longer the " most odious " ) of all monopolies , could be a " salutatory and respectable institution " on condition that it allowed for liberty and " repentance " ( presumably divorce ) . If these changes make the work seem less extreme , they also weaken , and at points even contradict , the original thesis . They also make it more difficult to praise the first edition so fulsomely while approving of all the later emendations . Godwin was 37 when Political Justice was first published-37 , as we now say , going on 17 . However wary one may be of the kind of reductivism that accounts for ideas in terms of personal experiences , one can hardly avoid noting that it was a celibate who wrote so contemptuously of sex ; a loner and drifter who had so little respect for social affections and associations ; a man with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family ; a former member of a sect that made reason the source of religious salvation who later made reason the primary qualification for human and social redemption . HE religious passion in atheism , 1 the messianic zeal in radicalism , are familiar enough , but rarely are they so demonstrable as in the case of Godwin . Godwin himself later explained the depredation of feeling in Political Justice as the lingering effect of " Sandemanianism , " a form of Calvinism that located salvation neither in good works nor in faith but rather in a rational understanding of divine truth . It was this rationalistic doctrine , hostile to emotion and affection and with a strong egalitarian bias , that dominated much of God-win 's early life and persisted even after he , at the age of 17 , entered a liberal Dissenting academy to prepare for the ministry . Within a year after leaving the academy , Godwin rapidly moved from Sandemanianism to deism , and from Toryism to republicanism . Yet for five years he tried to establish himself as a minister , going from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , Finally , in 1783 , at the age of 27 , he settled in London to make a career as a writer . By 1791 he had been sufficiently productive to receive an advance of one thousand guineas for a book on " Political Principles . " Two years later the two volumes of Political Justice appeared , and Godwin suddenly found himself famous . It is impossible to think of Political Justice , certainly it is impossible to account for its success , apart from the French Enlightenment and the French Revolution . One winces now at those all too familiar lines from Wordsworth 's Prelude : " Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive , /But to be young was very Heaven ! " But they do express the powerful attraction of the French Revolution ? " the attraction of a country in romance ! " ? and of a philosophy like Godwin 's eminently attuned to that Revolution , a philosophy in romance . The prospect of being liberated from " the meager , stale , forbidding ways/Of custom , law , and statute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " prime enchantress , " was especially appealing to the young . Of the poets who were enraptured by Political Justice when it first appeared , Wordsworth was 23 , Southey 19 , and Coleridge 21 . ( William Hazlitt , who retained his enthusiasm for the book long after the others , was all of 15 at the time . ) What is remarkable is not that God-win 's " Fantasy of Reason " ( the title of another recent biography of him ) appealed to those for whom the French Revolution gave promise of a new heavenly city on earth , but that it did so at a time when the Revolution itself was beginning to lose its appeal . By February 1793 , when Political Justice was published , the Revolution was becoming an embarrassment even for some of its more ardent English defenders . The execution of the King in January and the declaration of war against England had put English Jacobins in a difficult position ; and they became harder pressed in the following months with the extension of the war , the creation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ execution of the Queen and the Girondins . But the romance of revolution , of social rejuvenation , dies hard ; and the romance of reason , of a " human nature seeming born again " ( Wordsworth once more ) , dies harder still . S O IT was that Godwin 's book was at first hailed as a masterpiece . Three thousand copies of the two volumes were sold at the considerable price of three guineas . The price may have saved it from being proscribed ; Pitt is reputed to have said that it could do no harm to those " who had not three shillings to spare . " Although it did reach some of the poor in cheaper pirated editions and in extracts in collections of radical writings , it had its greatest success among intellectuals . By 1796 , however , when the second edition was published , and still more by the time of the third edition in 1798 , the shift in the climate of opinion caught up with Godwin , and some of his most ardent admirers became his most bitter critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Godwin . When he fell in love with Mary Wollstonecraft in1796 , he was 40 and she 37 . He was unattractive , ungainly , socially ill at ease , and sexually inexperienced ( this was his first affair and possibly his first sexual experience ) . She was handsome , buxom , gregarious , and , by reputation , promiscuous . She was also as celebrated a writer as he was ; her Vindication of the Rights of Men , a reply to Burke 's Reflections on the French Revolution , established her credentials as a radical , and her Vindications of the Rights of Women made her the first serious feminist . Her most recent affair had left her with an illegitimate child , and it was after she was abandoned by her lover and had tried ( for the second time ) to commit suicide that she became involved with Godwin . Godwin himself , having just published the second edition of his book deploring the irrationality of emotions , the immorality of private affections , and the puerility of sex , took to writing love letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carefully recorded the consummation of his love in his diary : " Chez moi , tonte . " Since both of them had made such a large point of condemning marriage , that " most odious of all monopolies , " they carried on their affair openly while maintaining separate lodgings . The scandal was not their liaison but their marriage the following year , decided upon after she became pregnant and apparently upon her urging . In spite of occasional complaints on her part that he was lacking in affection , the marriage was apparently happy for both of them . And there is no question but that he was genuinely desolate when she died soon after giving birth to their daughter Mary . Their celebrated relationship ( which feminists today regard as his principal claim to fame ) had lasted all of one year . A FEW YEARS AFTER Wollstonecraft 's death , having discovered the pleasures of sex and of the private affections ? and having revised Political Justice accordingly ? Godwin entered into another marriage with another Mary . This was far less happy and much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he acquired two new stepchildren ( also , apparently , illegitimate ) , a son , William , and financial obligations which he found difficult to meet . His greatest satisfaction came from his strikingly pretty and precocious daughter Mary . But she was also the cause of his greatest distress . She was 16 when Shelley ? then 22 , married and a father , and already cutting a romantic figure as a poet , novelist , atheist , and radical ? moved into the Godwin household to escape his debtors and promptly fell in love with her , as she did with him . When Godwin was told of this , his outrage at this " licentious love " was compounded by the fear that people might accuse him of having sold his daughter to Shelley . ( Although Shelley was in debt at the time , he was heir to a substantial fortune and had given Godwin large sums of money . ) Shelley promised at first to give up Mary , then reneged and proposed a menage el trois ( his wife was about to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandishing a pistol and a bottle of laudanum and threatening to commit suicide together with Mary . A few days later Shelley and Mary eloped ? accompanied by Jane ( Mary 's stepsister and Mrs. Godwin 's daughter ) . rr HIS was the beginning of a bizarre saga in which money figured almost as prominently as sex . While Godwin refused to see either his daughter or Shelley and resolutely ignored the births of their children , he continued to demand more money from Shelley , who , at first obligingly and then grudgingly , gave it to him . In the meantime Shelley , Mary , and Jane traveled and lived together . It is not clear whether Shelley was also having an affair with lane ( who , to complicate matters , decided to change her name to Claire ) , when she became involved with Byron and bore his child . About the same time Fanny ( Wollstonecraft 's first daughter ) committed suicide , apparently because of her unrequited love for Shelley . A month later Harriet , Shelley 's wife , also committed suicide in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lover . A month after that Shelley and Mary were married and Godwin was finally reconciled to them . It was a good match , he informed his brother , not that he himself cared about money or title ( he carefully identified Shelley as " the eldest son of Sir Timothy Shelley , of Field Place , in the county of Sussex , Baronet " ) , but only because he wanted his daughter to be " respectable , virtuous , and contented . " He was also pleased to attend the christening in church of his grandchildren . That was not , however , the end of the tale . Two years after the marriage , Claire gave birth to Shelley 's child ( who was registered as Marv 's ) . The following year Mary wrote a short novel about incest ( with obvious autobiographical intimations ) which she sent to Godwin for his opinion . He told her that he thought parts of it were well done but found the subject so " disgusting and detestable " that he refused to return the manuscript in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published posthumously . ) After Shelley 's death in 1822 , Mary continued to write novels and became increasingly conservative as she grew older . When a friend advised her to send her only surviving son to a school where they would teach him to think for himself , she replied , " For heaven 's sake , let him learn to think like everyone elsel " Thus the son of Shelley and the grandson of Godwin ( his last descendant ) went to Harrow and Trinity College , became a lawyer , a Member of Parliament , and a respectable patron of letters ? achieving the respectability Godwin had wanted for his own daughter . LL OF this would make for a dramat- ic enough story even if the protagonists were not who they were . But it is all the more dramatic with this cast of characters , and all the more in conjunction with Godwin 's ideas . For his life ? first his marriage with Wollstonecraft , then his second unhappy marriage , then the Shelley saga ? was a cruel commentary on his theories . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the teachings of Godwin , that libertinism was the consequence of libertarianism , and promiscuity of free love . Shelley , no doubt , would have carried on as he did without the inspiration of Political Justice , but he did profess , publicly as well as privately , the greatest admiration for that book , which was why he so generously subsidized its author . What makes the situation even more ironic is the fact that Godwin himself , long before Shelley entered his life , had begun to modify or discard one after another of his original doctrines ( without , to be sure , repudiating Political Justice itself ) . By the time they met , in 1812 , he had gone so far as to criticize a pamphlet in which Shelley , echoing Political Justice ? " when all men are good and wise , government will of itself decay " ? called upon the Irish to repeal the Union with England and to form political associations preparatory to their emancipation from government it-self . Reminding Shelley that he was against all associations , including radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . Every institution and form ot society is good in its place and the period ot time to which it belongs . How many beautiful and admirable effects grew out of Popery and the monastic institutions in the period when they were in their genuine health and vigour . To them we owe almost all our logic and literature . What excellent effects do we reap , even at this day , from the feudal system and from chivalry ! In this point of view nothing perhaps can be more worthy of our applause than the English Constitution . In his last major work , History of the Commonwealth , he came close to refuting perfectibility itself . It was easy , he said , for " the philosopher in his closet to invent imaginary schemes of policy , and to show how mankind , if they were without passions and without prejudices , might best he united in the form Much of the effect of literary art depends on a kind of inside knowledge , on the reverberations of personal association .

" The Miller 's Tale , " unexpurgated because it was a classic , was a rare , juicy morsel for readers starving on a diet of novels in which , if a newlywed Stakhanovite wanted to indicate to her husband that he had brought her into an interesting condition , she had to lead him under a blossoming cherry tree , point out a of a political community " ; unfortunately men are always " creatures of passions , " defying the " dictates of sobriety and speculation .
