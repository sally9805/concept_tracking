OTTAWA  --  A decades-old dispute over the use of the French language in Canada has been revived , splitting the ruling Conservative Party as Prime Minister Brian Mulroney starts to prepare for the next general election . The issue was resurrected last week , when the province of Saskatchewan introduced a bill detailing the language rights of its small French-speaking community . The legislation was termed too generous by some western Canadian members of Mr. Mulroney ' s party and too restrictive by some of his Quebec supporters . Protecting minority language rights is a major goal of Mr. Mulroney ' s government . His party ' s re-election in a vote expected to be called later this year depends on support from his home province of Quebec , the only province with a French-speaking majority , where language issues are extremely sensitive . While his right-wing western Canadian supporters had urged him to stay out of the dispute , Mr. Mulroney intervened Friday on behalf of the French-speaking minority in Saskatchewan . In a letter to provincial Premier Grant Devine , the prime minister said the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of existing rights . " The bill would allow some French to be used in the courts and the provincial legislature . But it exempts Saskatchewan from having to translate all its laws into French because of the cost . Mr. Mulroney offered federal assistance to help the province meet translation and interpretation costs . However much Mr. Mulroney intervenes in the issue , the language strains are expected to persist . Alberta , which is home to twice as many French-speaking Canadians as Saskatchewan ' s 25 , 000 , may also introduce a bill . With Alberta ' s Conservative government , such a move would help keep the controversy alive . The opposition Liberal Party has called the affair a " language crisis " and called for a special debate today in Parliament . Jack Scowen , a Conservative member of parliament from northern Saskatchewan , said that " unless somebody wants to stir up a bunch of garbage , " the language issue should be " left to die . " The issue of language has been one of the most troublesome in recent Canadian history . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadians of being overbearing in trying to achieve his goal of a bilingual Canada . But he was also viewed as the only leader who could fight the Quebec separatist movement , which sometimes won him ample parliamentary majorities . Mr. Mulroney , in a possible election year , wants to avoid a deepening rift in his party . In his caucus , he has had to accommodate a nationalist element from Quebec , including some former separatists , and right-wing members from the West , who don ' t view language rights as a priority . " There ' s so little contact between the two wings of the Tory party , " said Daniel Latouche , a political scientist at McGill University , " that they don ' t even know when they ' re insulting each other . " Quebec recently added to the dispute by irritating many Canadians when it censured Canada ' s Official Languages Commissioner for saying that Quebec ' s English-speaking minority often felt " humiliated " by the province .
