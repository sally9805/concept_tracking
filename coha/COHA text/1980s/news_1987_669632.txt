But the battle over war toys is far from won , say organizers and researchers who are in the thick of this controversy. // They point to the volume of toys that play on themes of conflict and the firmly welded connection between many of these toys and children ' s television programming . Hasbro , for instance , the largest toy producer in the United States , devotes nearly half of its 1987 catalog ( the boy ' s half , of course ) to such combative favorites as Battle Beasts , Air Raiders , and Transformers , as well as G.I. Joe. // // Behind the array of war-related toys in stores this holiday season - from plastic guns to ' ' action figures ' ' - lies the difficult question of their effect on children and society . On one side are those who feel war play teaches insensitivity to others and instills militaristic attitudes . On the other are people who say such play is natural and nothing to worry about. // Action figures like G.I. Joe and He-Man are essentially ' ' updated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Toy Manufacturers of America . He sees the popularity of these items tied to patriotism and the enduring attraction of battle play for kids . He also views public concern over war toys as largely the work of ' ' a vocal minority ' ' and the news media . ' ' I don ' t believe they ' ve gotten the attention of middle America , ' ' says Mr. Thompson. // Nancy Carlsson-Paige , an associate professor of education at Lesley College in Cambridge , Mass. , disagrees. // ' ' I ' ve talked to parents from many different social and educational backgrounds , and with differing political beliefs , and they all say the same thing , ' ' she says . ' ' Parents know that something is wrong . They know their kids are obsessed with TV-based war toys , that they ' re asking for them all the time . And they ' re trapped . Their children are begging for these things and they equate them with love. ' ' // Parental concern may be reflected in the vigor of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since early fall , the league has sold 2 , 000 antiwar toy organizers ' packets to people from all corners of the US , according to Joanne Sheehan , a coordinator for the campaign . That ' s a substantial increase over last year ' s orders . Typically , local activists distribute leaflets to shoppers and organize ' ' alternative toy fairs ' ' to highlight manufacturers that don ' t produce war-related items. // Educational efforts are having some impact , says Stevanne Auerback , a child psychologist and head of the San Francisco International Toy Museum . ' ' But this is just the beginning of it . We have a long way to go before there ' s going to be a change , as long as there are parents out there buying the toys. ' ' // Contrary to Thompson of the Toy Manufacturers Association , Dr. Carlsson-Paige draws a sharp distinction between current war toys and the cowboys , Indians , and soldiers of the past . She and co-author Diane Levin , an education professor at Wheelock College in Boston , recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Play Dilemma ' ' ( Teachers College Press ) . // They concede the argument that war play has been around for millennia and can help meet children ' s needs to feel powerful and in control of something - a position taken by many child-development experts. // But toy lines like G.I. Joe and He Man don ' t give kids much of an opportunity to create their own play and exercise control , says Carlsson-Paige . ' ' These toys kind of teach you what to do , with all the accouterments , the scenario laid out on the box , and the whole thing replicated from TV , ' ' she says. // ' ' Play is a very deep process , where a child has control of everything going on and invents the play scenes . . . . Issues get worked out in the play process , things like being separated from home or feeling small , ' ' Carlsson-Paige continues . Some current toys , with scripts supplied by toy companies and TV , ' ' interfere with the process of play as we know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the combination of violence-oriented toys and play scenarios developed by adults in toy firms and film studios , instead of by children themselves , leads to ever more violent play . They say that the preschool and elementary-level teachers they ' ve interviewed confirm this. // Bev Bos , who runs the Roseville Cooperative Preschool in Roseville , Calif. , agrees that today ' s war toys present a ' ' huge problem ' ' to teachers and parents . Her school , like many , bans guns and other war toys . ' ' We ' ve got to give power to kids in other ways , ' ' she says , explaining that she provides so many ' ' positive outlets ' ' for children at the school - from art projects to tree climbing to playing in mud - that the war play issue rarely has an opportunity to surface. // But ' ' when a kid uses his finger for a gun , there ' s not much you can do about it , ' ' she admits. // War play often surfaces no matter how hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bettelheim , a pioneer in the child-development field , writes in his latest book , ' ' A Good Enough Parent ' ' ( Knopf , $18. 95 ) : ' ' Often a child ' s desire to play with toy guns is mainly motivated by his wanting to be able to protect himself symbolically . If his parents prevent him from doing so , he feels deprived of a chance to protect himself by those who ought to be his natural protectors. ' ' // Mr. Bettelheim also recommends , however , that parents take advantage of such play to point out the consequences of shooting and killing in terms a child can grasp . If the target is a parent , for example , he suggests asking the child who ' s going to pour their milk or serve their ice cream if mom or dad were shot. // That ' s related to a main point in the book by Carlsson-Paige and Levin : that the best approach by a concerned parent or teacher might be thoughtful intervention in war play , rather than its outright ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stance. // They suggest , for instance , that in the midst of a youthful G.I. Joe battle , a adult could ask whether Cobra ( the arch bad guy ) has a home , or whether he ' s hurt and needs attention. // Anything , they say , to insert a bit of humanity and help children expand their play beyond repetitive , stylized violence. // And is there any relation between a child ' s love of war play and what he becomes later in life ? // When children ' ' wish to engage in such play we should accept it as such : play that is important to them and that foretells nothing about their future lives , ' ' Bettelheim counsels in his book. // Carlsson-Paige concurs in principle , noting that she was herself an avid fan of cap guns as a child . But she is concerned about the politically tinged packaging blurbs and cartoon plots that envelop some of the action figure toy lines. // The message , she says , is that the world is a dangerous place and you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to think seriously about the culture we ' re conveying to children , ' ' she warns. // //
