" It looks like we baited the hook a little too well , " said Edmonton defenseman Lee Fogolin . " What we have now is a 600-pound marlin swimming away with our line . " The Black Hawks are the marlin , and for Tuesday ' s Chapter 5 in this tale of the young men and the sea of emotion the teams returned to Edmonton ' s Northlands Coliseum . Wayne Gretzky ' s two goals put the Oilers ahead 6-4 late in the second period . Emotion on the part of the Hawks and their fanatic followers perhaps was the primary component in the Hawks ' Chicago Stadium victories in Games 3 and 4 of the Stanley Cup semifinal series . " After the first two games at home , it seemed that everybody had written off the Hawks , " said Oiler defenseman Kevin Lowe . " Everybody that is , except the people who really counted  --  the members of our team , the Black Hawks and the Chicago fans . " Although at times they appear to have little knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can prove beneficial to their team . It does help . In fact , a lot . " It ' s now down to the nitty-gritty . A best-of-three series with home-ice to our advantage . " Game 6 will be played Thursday night in Chicago Stadium . If a seventh game is needed , it will be played on Edmonton ice . Comparing fans in the Stadium with those in the Northlands Coliseum is like comparing lions with lambs , and the Oilers were publicly imploring their supporters to shed their sheep ' s clothing . In the column he is writing for the Edmonton Sun , Lowe asked for " help from the stands . " A story atop page 1 of the Edmonton Journal was headlined in screaming red type : " Okay , let ' s HEAR it ! now " . In the story , Wayne Gretzky , the Oilers ' captain and the most dominant individual player in hockey history , said : " I think the Hawks ' fans were a factor in their winning . It ' s the loudest I ' ve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made The Great Gretzky forget that noise is heard and not seen or he really does have qualities that are alien to the rest of the human race . " They give their team such an emotional boost , " Gretzky went on . " I couldn ' t hear the organ player . The fans yelling is annoying , but it ' s what makes the Stadium such a zoo . Their fans really get them motivated . I ' m sure our fans will be louder and noisier than they ' ve ever been . " Meanwhile , another Oiler superstar , defenseman Paul Coffey , has called for a different approach to the Hawks on the ice . " There are key players we ' ve got to get to , " said Coffey , who is skating wounded with an injured right foot , back spasms and a right forearm that was banged up by Jack O ' Callahan ' s stick in Game 4 . " We ' ve got to do to them what they ' ve been doing to our key guys . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been getting constantly whacked . Wayne Gretzky has been hounded and close-checked . " What are we doing going after a guy like Behn Wilson ? We should go after Denis Savard . Look at Steve Larmer  --  he ' s a sleeper you don ' t notice until the puck is in the net . If Chicago wants to play dirty , why don ' t we go after ( goalie ) Murray Bannerman ? " Hawk general manager and coach Bob Pulford takes exception to the charge that his Hawks are playing dirty . He blames Edmonton for initiating the nasty body talk in Game 4 that produced three fights , a lot of other malicious mischief and 18 penalties for the Oilers and 17 for the Hawks . " We can play it whichever way they want to , " said Pulford . " If they want to start something the way they did , we ' re not going to back down . But if they want to just play hockey that ' s what we ' ll do . " We ' d be crazy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be careful and not take bad penalties . You can be five goals down just as easy as not . " Pulford and assistant coach Roger Neilson believe there ' s a difference between playing physically and playing dirty . " The key is to always make contact with their defense , " said Neilson . " Everytime Coffey or Lowe has the puck , bump them . Let them know they ' re going to get hit . Make them tired . " The Hawks ' interpreted the Oilers ' willingness to get overly physical in Game 4 as a good omen . " They came out and tried to run us , " said Ed Olzyk . " That isn ' t their game . We had them talking on the ice , not only to us but to themselves . " The Oilers gained a 5-4 lead halfway through the game on Wayne Gretzky ' s goal at 8 : 15 of the second period . All of the Hawk goals came on power plays . Troy Murray , Darryl Sutter and Steve Larmer put the puck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the bull ' s-eye in the second . Edmonton ' s Mike Krushelnyski opened the scoring with the game 71 seconds old and Jari Kurri , who assisted on that goal , got two goals of his own in the first period . In the second period Mark Messier scored the goal that tied the score 4-4 . Defensemen Doug Wilson and Keith Brown returned to the Chicago lineup after missing three games apiece because of injuries . Wilson assisted on two of the goals in the first 30 minutes of action .
