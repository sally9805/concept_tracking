The authorization would include $70 million in military and $30 million in nonlethal aid to the guerrillas , known as contras . Congress cut off covert military aid to the rebels in 1984 and approved $27 million in the current fiscal year for food , medical supplies and other nonlethal support. // Under close questioning by dubious senators , Mr. Shultz conceded that only $18 million of that had been spent so far , mainly because of resistance by Honduras to its territory being used as a conduit for supplies. // He also painted a vivid picture of the Government in Managua subverting neighboring Latin American countries with extensive Soviet and Cuban support. // Presenting a map of the region , he asserted that arms from Nicaragua had been discovered in the hands of insurgents and terrorists in Guatemala , El Salvador , Honduras , Costa Rica and Colombia . Nicaragua had provided military training to guerrillas operating in Venezuela , Brazil , Ecuador , Uruguay and Chile , he said , and safe haven to radicals from Bolivia and Argentina . <> <> ' On the Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a fundamentally evil way , " Mr. Shultz said of the Nicarguan Government . " There is incontrovertible proof that the Nicaraguan Government is involved in drug trafficking , " he added , but did not provide the evidence. // " We ' re for the good guys , " the Secretary asserted . " We ' re on the right side in this issue . I know who the good guys and the bad guys are. " // At the White House , President Reagan. who was applauded today by a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders for his handling of the Philippines crisis , told the group that the successful transition to democracy in this instance reinforced the need for Congress to approve increased aid for the Nicaraguan rebels. // According to Larry Speakes , the White House spokesman , Mr. Reagan told the legislators that " several parallels " existed between the Philippines and Nicaragua. // " We can ignore the fraudulent elections Ortega had , " Mr. Speakes quoted Mr. Reagan as having said in reference to President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , terrorism and drug trafficking . But if we ignore it in Nicaragua and don ' t deal with it now , when will we deal with it ? " // The spokesman said that Mr. Reagan had added that the most important parallel between the two cases was that " we stood for democracy in the Philippines ; we have to stand for democracy in Nicaragua and throughout Central America and in our own hemisphere. " // Mr. Shultz ' s appearance came as a Nicaraguan official told reporters in Managua that the aid request was a " slap in the face " to Latin America that could force Nicaragua to seek more military aid from abroad. // " Reagan persists stubbornly in his war policy , aimed at increasing tension in Central America and inflaming an already serious crisis , " United Press International quoted Acting Foreign Minister Victor Hugo Tinoco as having said. // The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee , Senator Richard G. Lugar , Republican of Indiana , endorsed the Administration ' s basic objectives without committing himself on the specific aid request. // Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard questions . They asked whether the effort would really work , whether it had the realistic potential of either overthrowing the Sandinistas or pressing them into negotiations . <> <> ' Simplistic ' Views Criticized // The neat juxtaposition between good and evil was challenged by Senator Christopher J. Dodd , Democrat of Connecticut. // " We ' ve had the President and others calling the contras Jeffersonian democrats , and we ' ve had others referring to the Sandinistas as some new order of Franciscan monks , " he said . " Frankly , both observations are terribly simplistic , and I think it makes it more difficult to really trying to come up with intelligent solutions to this problem. " // Mr. Dodd recalled President Reagan ' s saying in 1984 that if former President Ferdinand E. Marcos were not supported in the Philippines , the alternative would be Communism . " I ' d hate to think we ' ve reached a conclusion in Central America that the only choice here is between the contras and the Sandinistas , and that we have abandoned our creativity. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad guys " was an oversimplification . But he asserted passionately that support for the resistance had grown as the Sandinistas had eliminated individual liberties inside Nicaragua . <> <> ' It ' s Not a Flip Subject ' // He reacted sharply when Senator Daniel J. Evans , Republican of Washington , made fun of a chart , presented by State Department aides , showing the armed resistance growing , even in the two years after a cutoff of United States military aid . " I calculate that after about three more years of no aid , the armed resistance will be considerably larger than the Nicaraguan military. " // " Are you serious about that ? " asked Mr. Shultz . " No , " Senator Evans replied . " Or is that a flip comment ? It ' s not a flip subject , " Mr. Shultz declared . " It ' s a very serious subject . And the point is , there would be more people on this chart if we gave them some support , if they had some shoes to wear and some uniforms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pounding the table , nearly shouting. // " These are people who are trying to attain freedom and independence in their country ! And we have to consider whether or not we ' re going to step in behind them and help them . That ' s what this is about . Right here on our doorstep !
