Howard Stern is an equal-opportunity offender . With his raucous gibes and racy double entendres , he galls black and white , Jew and Gentile , man and woman . You name them , Howard Stern has insulted them . Stern 's radio talk show , broadcast in New York City and Philadelphia weekdays from 6 a.m. to 10 a.m. , is perhaps the most scabrous of a genre that has come to be known as raunch radio . The brash , shaggy-haired Stern maintains that he could not care less whom he offends , but last week he offended the one group that could turn off his microphone : the Federal Communications Commission . <P> In an action that considerably broadens its definition of indecency on the airwaves , the FCC issued warnings to three radio licensees , among them WYSP- FM , the Philadelphia station that airs Stern 's show , for broadcasting material that contained sexually explicit language . One of those stations , cited for broadcasting excerpts from a play describing homosexual practices , was referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal prosecution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and restrict  --  the sexual content of what broadcasters say , the FCC suggested it will henceforth take enforcement action against shows it deems to be " indecent . " <P> Until now , the regulatory agency has acted only against violations of its so-called seven-dirty-words policy , a standard first enunciated in 1976 in response to the broadcast of a monologue by Comedian George Carlin titled Filthy Words , in which he mocked the banning of certain sexually explicit terms . In its ruling that year against New York City station WBAI-FM , the FCC defined indecency as anything " patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards , " but the commission elected to move against only those stations that permitted one of the proscribed words to be uttered on the air at a time of day when children might be listening . Last week , however , the commission announced it will now use the wider definition . Said FCC General Counsel Diane Killory : " The interpretation has been too narrow . We will apply the generic definition and not limit it arbitrarily to seven specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramp the style of broadcasters as well as the range of subjects they are willing to discuss . Barry Lynn , an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer in Washington , D.C. , noted that Stern 's monologues may be rude , but they are not lewd and are " well within the bounds of protected bad taste " as guaranteed by the First Amendment . David Salniker , executive director of the Pacifica Foundation , which operates one of the stations reprimanded by the FCC , argued that the agency is far too vague about where it is drawing the line . " Does this mean that Alice Walker ca n't read from The Color Purple anymore , as she has on our station , because the book deals with incest ? " he asked . <P> Lawyer Steven Lerman , who represents WYSP , put it most succinctly : " What was protected speech yesterday is not protected speech today . " Yesterday 's innuendo , he suggests , is today 's indecency .
