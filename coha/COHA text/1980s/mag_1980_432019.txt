 | Hemmed in by trouble from all sides , the royal family that rules this desert kingdom is closing ranks in a concerted effort to cope with zealots at home and an oil-hungry world outside . Even with its vital oil reserves ? the richest on earth ? Saudi Arabia has little to cheer about . King Khalid , 66 , suffers from a serious heart ailment , and his days on the throne could be numbered . Moslem radicals and even some young military men are questioning royal rule . Turmoil in Iran , the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and a strong Russian presence in the neighboring Marxist nation of South Yemen raise serious questions about the country 's security . On one side , the United States pressures the House of Saud to keep oil output high and prices low . On the other , radical Arab states want Riyadh to use its oil weapon against Washington in order to destroy U.S.-sponsored peace negotiations between Egypt and Israel . Mainly because of health problems , King Khalid has long given up his attempts to govern Saudi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 59-year-old Crown Prince Fand , who has been chosen as Khalid 's successor . With the King the symbol of the Saud dynasty , the royal family 's rule over Saudi Arabia is near absolute and until recently was troubled only by the maneuvering for power of rival princes . Royal complacency was shattered last November , however , when a force of Moslem zealots seized the Great Mosque in Mecca , the holiest shrine in this puritanically religious Islamic country . The takeover , discovery of caches of illegal weapons in desert villages and realization that there is budding political opposition in this country jolted the Saudi princes and drew them together in a joint determination to set the situation right . In the aftermath of the Mecca battle , rival princes firmed up the line of succession to the throne , and Fand tried to quiet unrest by promising the country its first constitution . If he follows through , it will be a radical shift for Saudi Arabia , described by a Western diplomat as " the only family-owned enterprise recognized at the U.N . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7.8 million people . One of every 2,000 Saudis is a fullfledged prince . An elite of 150 senior princes dominates every level of commerce , government and the military . Founder of the dynasty was a Bedouin warrior named Abdel Aziz , better known internationally as Ibn Saud , who set out on horseback in 1902 with 40 companions and a dream of conquering a country half the size of the U.S. east of the Mississippi . It took him 30 years to subdue the scattered Arabian tribes and to mold a nation . To insure the loyalty of his enemies , Ibn Saud took wives from each conquered tribe . Before he died in 1953 , he had fathered at least 40 sons , including Khalid and Fand . Ibn Saud was succeeded by King Saud , who was forced to abdicate in 1964 in favor of Faisal , who in turn was assassinated by a deranged nephew in 1975 . Then Khalid took over . In all , there are more than 4,000 Saudi princes and almost as many princesses . Loosening grip ? Recent years have brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grip . An infusion of oil wealth ? 90 billion dollars a year ? not only poses a danger to traditional Islamic values embraced by most Saudis , but it has spawned an educated , well-to-do middle class that seeks a larger role in government . In theory , the King owns everything in his realm . He consults no parliament of outsiders . Decisions are made by a royal council where family factions push and shove to get their way . Private though it is , the council lately has begun to feel pressure from nonroyal sources , including religious leaders and a sizable technocracy that has grown up with the oil industry . Western experts believe that Fand may be the most capable and experienced of all the princes . He has been the actual Saudi leader for years , in part because of political savvy and partly because of Khalid 's retiring na- ture . A compromise choice for the job to begin with , Khalid is uninterested in routine affairs of state and is happier visiting tribal chieftains and hunting . Fand is a more controversial figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land still are offended by the playboy reputation he earned while traveling in Europe and America in younger days . Once known as a drinker who gambled away a fortune , Fand now frowns on high life . He recently complained about Saudis who " shower dancers and singers with banknotes in European nightclubs . " Western diplomats are pleased by the prospect of Fand as King . They believe he will be an active , strong monarch with pro-Western views on oil , defense and other matters . They are convinced that by force of personality , Fand will be able to subdue anti-West elements within the royal circle . " Jimmy Carter should be happy that Fand is next in line , " says one . diplomat . " Of all senior princes , he 's the most zealous about keeping Saudi Arabia 's oil production at 9.5 million barrels a day . Fand believes that the stability of the West is in Saudi Arabia 's best interests . " Need for accord . Still , no Saudi King is all powerful . Fand will be subject to second-guessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They are consulted on oil production and other basic policies , and no King is comfortable if he acts without their agreement . The most powerful faction within the royal family is the Sudayri Seven ? sons of Ibn Saud by his favorite wife . Among them are Fand ; the Defense Minister , Prince Sultan , and the heads of other key Saudi ministries . As King , Fand would answer to these and other princes , most notably Prince Abdallah , now No. 3 man in the hierarchy and commander of the National Guard . The family accord worked out after the Mecca attack would make him Crown Prince once Fand becomes King . Unlike Fand , Abdallah is a blunt , oldfashioned Bedouin , unconcerned by diplomatic niceties . He is far closer to other Arab states than Fand and would like Saudi Arabia to improve ties with Iraq and other radical Arab neighbors . This holds seeds for future friction . In a legacy of history , religious leaders also have an impact on royal decisions . An alliance between an ancestral Saudi and a fundamentalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , the Wahhabi Moslem sect has enormous influence throughout the kingdom . Nothing becomes law until the religious council makes certain it conforms with the Koran , Islam 's holy book . Conservative Moslem influence is on the rise , and sharia , the behavior code based on the Koran , is being more strictly enforced in Saudi Arabia . At the same time , a sophisticated group of technocrats , many educated in the West , is trying to nudge decision making in a more liberal direction . Although commoners , these experts are moving rapidly into positions of influence in the government . Some , like Petroleum Minister Ahmed Zaki Yamani , run important Saudi ministries , alongside royal princes . Lesser-known figures like Planning Minister Hisham Nazer have gained power through their control of billions of dollars in government programs . Equally important as a liberalizing element is a new class of wealthy merchant families created by the oil boom . Some are richer than the King . With so many parties bending the ear of the royal family , dealings with the Saudi government can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action complain about red tape and long delays . But nothing will change soon . One prince calls the slow pace " our security blanket . It means we do n't make rash decisions . " Nevertheless , the monarchy is aware of its problems . Family members are concerned that a split among the leading princes could undermine a fragile power coalition , Not long ago , for instance , the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency passed word of a serious rift between Abdallah and Prince Sultan . The traumatic events of the Mecca takeover have overcome ? at least temporarily ? any animosity between the two , and Abdallah is firmly ensconced in the role of Crown Prince-designate . But no one here believes that rivalry between Abdallah and Sultan , a notch below him in seniority , has been erased . Nor is there any guarantee that , without formal hereditary guidelines , future successions to the throne will come-off as smoothly as in the past , with no power struggles . Willing to wait ? Family members insist it will be the same after Khalid . But an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be unwilling to wait its turn . Of hundreds of Ibn Saud 's grandsons , King Faisal 's sons command the most respect here . Prince Saud , 39 , the Foreign Minister , is being prominently mentioned as a possible successor to the throne , as is his younger brother Turki , head of Saudi intelligence . Despite official assurances that all is going well , foreign analysts believe that the royal family lately has come upon hard times that may not soon go away . Some even predict that in the not-too-distant future , the monarchy could be toppled by a popular revolt or by a military coup ? the same fate met by other Mideast rulers in recent years , Yet the House of Saud impresses even skeptics with its staying power . Says a senior diplomat in Riyadh : " They have an amazing sense of survival . If I had to bet , I 'd say the royal family still will be here years from now . They 'll find a way to stay on top .
