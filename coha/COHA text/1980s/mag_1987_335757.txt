Washington 's No. 1 foregone conclusion these days is that when U.S. Appeals Court Judge Robert Bork 's nomination to the Supreme Court reaches the Senate Judiciary Committee , a battle royal will begin . Still , there is no sign anybody is postponing squabbling until the confirmation hearings . Even the question of when the hearings should start has raised a ruckus . Sept. 15 , committee Democrats decided last week . Horrors , said the White House , eager to have Bork seated before the next court term in October . Implored White House Spokesman Marlin Fitzwater : " We would sure like to start the new term with a full court . " <P> The White House was also miffed by word that Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware , the Judiciary Committee chairman and Democratic presidential hopeful , intends to lead the fight against the conservative Bork  --  exploiting a chance to win favor among liberal groups in a well-publicized setting . Biden , grumbled Fitzwater , has chosen to " politicize the hearings . " Shocking .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
