this portion of New York appears to man ) , persons the most delectable . It has a kind of established repose which is not of frequent occurrence in other quarters of the long , shrill city ; it has a riper , richer , more honorable look than any of the upper ramifications of the great longitudinal thoroughfare ? the look of having had something of a social history . ? Henry James , Washington Square I first came down to Washington Square on a colorless February morning in 1946 . I was seventeen and a half years old and was carrying my lunch in a brown paper bag , just as I had carried it to high school only a month before , It was ? I thought it was ? the opening day of spring term at Washington Square College , my initiation into my freshman year at New York University . All I knew of NM then was that my science-minded brother had gone there ; he had written from the Army that I ought to go there too . With master-of-ceremonies zest he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Main Building as a paradisal chamber whose bookish loungers leafed languidly through magazines and exchanged high-principled witticisms between classes . It had the sound of a carpeted Olympian club in Oliver Wendell Holmes 's Boston , Hub of the Universe , strewn with leather chairs and delectable old copies of The Yellow Book . On that day 1 had never heard of Oliver Wendell Holmes or The Yellow Book , and . Cynthia Ozick is the author of The Pagan Rabbi and Other Stories , Levitation : Five Fictions , and The Cannibal Galaxy . She is at wink on a new navel . Washington Square was a far-away bower where wounded birds fell out of trees . My brother had once brought home from Washington Square Park a baby sparrow with a broken leg , to he nurtured back to flight . It died instead , emitting in its last hours melancholy faint cheeps , and leaving behind a dense recognition of the minute explicitness of mortality . All the same , in the February grayness Washington Square had the allure of the celestial unknown . A sparrow might die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt my youth like a nimbus . Which dissolves into the dun gauze of a low and sullen city sky . And here I am flying out of the Lexington Avenue subway at Astor Place , just a few yards from Wanamaker 's , here 1 am turning a corner past a secondhand bookstore and a union hall ; already late , I begin walking Very fast toward the park . The air is smoky with New York winter grit , and on clogged Broadway a mob of trucks shifts squawking gears . But there , just ahead , crisscrossed by paths under high branches , is Washington Square ; and on a single sidewalk , three clear omens ? or call them riddles , intricate and redolent . These I will disclose in a moment , but before that you must push open the heavy brass-and-glass doors of the Main Building and come with me , at a hard and panting pace , into the lobby of Washington Square College on the earliest morning of my freshman year . On the left , a bank of elevators . Straight ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunnel . And empty , all empty . I can hear my solitary footsteps reverberate , as in a radio mystery drama : they lead me up a short staircase into a big dark ghost-town cafeteria . My brother 's letter , along with his account of the physics and chemistry laboratories ( I will never see Across the street from the Main Building , the three omens . First , a pretzel man with a cart . He 's wearing a sweater , a cap that keeps him faceless ? he 's nothing but the shadows of his creases ? and wool gloves with the fingertips cut off . He never moves ; he might as well be made of papier-mache , set up and left out in the open since spring . There are now almost no pretzels for sale , and this gives me a chance to inspect the construction of his bare pretzel-poles . The pretzels are hooked over a column of gray cardboard cylinders , themselves looped around a stick , the way horseshoes drop around a post . The cardboard cylinders are the insides of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Chock Full 0 ' Nuts ( that 's the second omen ) and a newsstand ( that 's the third ) . The Chock Full : the doors are like fans , whirling remnants of conversation . She will marry him . She will not marry him . Fragrance of coffee and hot chocolate . We can prove that the senses are partial and unreliable vehicles of information , but who is to say that reason is not equally a product of human Limitation ? Powdered doughnut sugar on their lips . Attached to a candy store , the newsstand . Copies of Partisan Review : the table of the gods . Jean Stafford , Mary McCarthy , Elizabeth Hardwick , Irving Howe , Delmore Schwartz , Alfred Kazin , Clement Greenberg , Stephen Spender , William Phillips , John Berryman , Saul Bellow , Philip Rahv , Richard Chase , Randall Jarrell , Simone de Beauvoir , Karl Shapiro , George Orwell : I do n't know a single one of these names , but I feel their small conflagration flaming in the gray street : the succulent hotness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofthem . Since all the money I have is my subway fare ? a nickel ? I do n't buy a copy ( the price of Partisan in 1946 is fifty cents ) ; I pass on . I pass on to the row of houses on the north side of the square . Henry James was born in one of these , but I do n't know that either . Still , they are plainly old , though no longer aristocratic : haughty last-century shabbies with shut eyelids , built of rosy-ripe respectable brick , down on their luck . Across the park bulks Judson Church , with its squat squarish hell tower ; by the end of the week I will he languishing at the margins of a basketball game in its basement , forlorn in my blue **25;3968;TOOLONG gym suit and mooning over Emily Dickinson : There 's a certain Slant of light , 1X/ncer A fternuonsThat oppresses , like the Heft Of Cathedral Tunes Begin with the benches in the park . Here , side by side with students and their looseleafs , lean or lie the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubles : all those pitiables , half-women and half-men , neither awake nor asleep ; the discountable , the repudiated , the unseen . No more notice is taken of any of them than of a scudding fragment of newspaper in the path . Even then , even so lung ago , the benches of Washington Square are pimpled with this hell-tossed crew , these Mad Margarets and Cokey Joes , these volcanic coughers , shakers , groaners , tremblers , droolers , blasphemers , these public urinators with vomitous breath and rusted teeth stumps , dead-eyed and self-abandoned , dragging their makeshift junkyard shoes , their buttonless layers of raggedy ratfur . The pretzel man with his toilet paper rolls conjures and spews them all ? he is a loftier brother to these citizens of the lower pox , he is guardian of the garden of the jettisoned . They rattle along all the seams of Washington Square . They are the pickled city , the true and universal City-below-Cities , the wolfish vinegar-Babylon that dogs the spittled skirts of bohemia . The toilet paper rolls are the temple columns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Chock Full 0 ' Nuts . Here is the marketplace of Washington Square , its bazaar , its roiling gossip-parlor , its matchmaker 's office . and arena ? the outermost wing , so to speak , evolved from the Commons . On a day like today , when the Commons is closed , the Chock Full is thronged with extra power , a cello making up for a missing viola . Until now , the fire of my vitals has been for the imperious tragedians of the Aeneid ; I have lived in the narrow throat of poetry . Another year or so of this oblivion , until at last I am hammer-struck with the shock of Europe 's skull , the bled planet of death camp and war . Eleanor Roosevelt has not yet written her famous column announcing the discovery of Anne Frank 's diary . The term " cold war ' is new . The Commons , like the college itself , is overcrowded , veteransin their pragmatic thirties mingling with the reluctant dreamy young . And the Commons is convulsed with politics : a march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom , to protest the arrival of Walter Gieseking , the German musician who flourished among Nazis . The Communists ? two or three readily recognizable cantankerous zealots ? stomp through with their daily leaflets and sneers . There is even a Monarchist , a small poker-faced rectangle of a man with secretive tireless eves who , when approached for his views , always demands , in perfect Bronx tones , the restoration of his king . The engaged girls ? how many of them there seem to he ! ? dash their rings and tangle their ankles in their long New Look skirts . There is no feminism and no feminists : I am , I think , the only one . The Commons is a tide : it washes up the cold war , it washes up the engaged girls ' rings , it washes up the several philosophers and the numerous poets . The philosophers are all existentialists ; the poets are all influenced by The Waste Land . When the Commons overflows , the engaged girls cross the street to show not change ; it keeps on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Life magazine ? the wildest Picasso I can find : a face that is also a belly . Mt . George E. Mutch , a lyrical young English teacher still in his twenties , writes on the blackboard : " When lilacs last in the dooryard bloom ' 13 , " and " Bare , ruined choirs , where late the sweet birds sang , " and " A green thought in a green shade " ; he tells us to burn , like Pater , with a hard , gemlike flame . Another English teacher ? older and crustier ? compares Walt Whitman to a plumber ; the next year he is rumored to have shot himself in a wood . The initial letters of Washington Square College are a device to recall three of the seven deadly sins : Wantonness , Sloth , Covetousness . In the Commons they argue the efficacy of the organ box . Eda Lou Walton , sprightly as a bird , knows all the Village bards , and is a Village bard herself Sidney Hook is an intellectual rumble in the logical middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the very soul who , in a far-off time of bewitchment , hired Thomas Wolfe . And so , in February 1946 , I make my first purchase of a " real " book ? which is to say , not for the classroom . It is displayed in the window of the secondhand bookstore between the Astor Place subway station and the union hall , and for weeks I have been coveting it : Of Time and the River . I am transfigured ; I am pierced through with rapture ; skipping gym , I sit among morning mists on a windy bench a foot from the stench of Mad Margaret , sinking into that cascading syrup : " Man 's youth is a wonderful thing : It is so full of anguish and of magic and he never comes to know it as it is , until it is gone from him forever .... And what is the essence of that strange and bitter miracle of life which we feel so poignantly , so unutterably , with such a bitter pain and joy , when we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind grieved , ghost , come back again ! In Washington Square I am appareled in the " numb exultant secreciesof fog , fog-numb air filled with solemn joy of nameless and impending prophecy , an ancient yellow light , the old . smoke-ochre of the morning ... The smoke-ochre of the morning . Ah , you who have flung Thomas Wolfe , along with your strange and magical youth , onto the ash-heap of juvenilia and excess , myself among you , is n't this a lovely phrase still ? It rises out of the old pavements of Washington Square as delicately-colored as an eggshell . The veterans in their pragmatic thirties are nailed to Need ; they have families and futures to attend to . When Mr. George E. Mutch exhorts them to burn with a hard , gemlike flame , and writes across the blackboard the line that reveals his own name , The world is too much with us , late and soon , Getting and spending , we lay waste our powers , one of the veterans heckles , " What about getting a Buick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at sixteen , is a whole year younger than I ; he has transparent eyes and a rosebud mouth , and is in love with a poet named Diana . He has already found his way to the Village bars , and keeps in his wallet Truman Capote 's secret telephone number . We tie our scarves tight against the cold and walk up and down Fourth Avenue , winding in and out of the rows of secondhand bookshops crammed one against the other . The proprietors sit reading their wares and never look up . The books in all their thousands smell sleepily of cellar . Our envy of them is speckled with longing ; our longing is sick with envy . We are the sorrowful literary young . Every day , month after month , I hang around the newsstand near the candy store , drilling through the enigmatic pages of Partisan Review . I still have n't bought a copy ; I still ca n't understand a word . I do n't know what cold war means . Who is Trotsky ? I have n't read Ulysses ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pies Aeneas . I 'm in my mind 's cradle , veiled by the exultant secrecies of fog . Washington Square will wake me . In a lecture room in the Main Building , Dylan Thomas will cry his web:work syllables . Afterward he 'll warm himself at the White Horse Tavern . Across the corridor I will see Sidney Hook plain . I will read the Bhagavad-Giza and Catullus and Lessing , and , in Hebrew , a novel eerily called Whither ? It will be years and years before I am smart enough , worldly enough , to read Alfred Kazin and Mary McCarthy . In the spring , all of worldly Washington Square will wake up to the luster of little green leaves .
