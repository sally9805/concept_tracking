NEW YORK  --  Bond prices surged early yesterday but later fell , winding up slightly higher than Monday . Prices of some U.S. government bonds rose by nearly one-half point , or almost $5 for each $1 , 000 face amount , in the morning . By the close , however , the gains were pared to only about 1/8 of a point , or around $1. 25 for each $1 , 000 of bonds . Nonetheless , many traders and investment managers still expect slightly lower interest rates over the next few months . " The market has a bullish tone , " largely reflecting widespread expectations of a continued slowdown in the pace of the U.S. economic expansion , said Samuel Kahan , a vice president of Heinold Commodities Inc. in Chicago . But Mr. Kahan contended that such hopes aren ' t justified . " Increases in employment and personal income will continue to fuel consumer spending , " he predicted . The economy is going to continue to expand at least at a moderate clip and possibly at a " robust " pace , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates to remain at current levels or rise . Many other analysts disagree . John D. Paulus , chief economist of Morgan Stanley &; Co. , predicts most interest rates , such as those on Treasury bills and bonds , will decline by about one-half percentage point in the current quarter . But he also expects rates to bounce back again to current levels by midyear and to continue rising in the second half . The bond market was helped yesterday by a decline in the closely watched interest rate on federal funds , which are reserves that banks lend each other overnight . The funds rate hovered between about 9 5/16% and 9 7/16% , down from Monday ' s average of 9. 55% . The funds rate strongly influences other interest rates , including those that dealers pay to finance their securities holdings . Several bond traders said they expect little or no change in Federal Reserve System credit policy . The Fed appears to be reluctant to let interest rates drop significantly because such a decline might add too much stimulus to the economy and arouse renewed fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they expect the federal funds to remain in the 9 3/8%-to-9 1/2% range . The Federal Reserve ' s policy-making arm , the Federal Open Market Committee , is scheduled to hold its next regular meeting Jan. 30 and 31 . Dana Johnson , an economist at Continental Illinois National Bank &; Trust Co. of Chicago , predicts Fed officials at that meeting will conclude there isn ' t any reason to ease credit conditions . " The Fed will want to have some pretty definitive evidence that the economy has slowed significantly " before taking any credit-easing moves , Mr. Johnson said . " And there just won ' t be enough evidence of that by late January . " Still , Mr. Johnson expects lower interest rates in the second quarter , with the federal funds rate dropping to about 8 1/2% by midyear . Later in the year , though , the federal funds rate probably will bounce back to around its current level as the economic expansion " leads to a resurgence of private credit demands , " warns Mr. Johnson , director of capital markets research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury ' s 12% bonds due 2013 closed at a price of 101 20/32 , up from 101 1/2 Monday . That brought the yield down slightly to 11. 79% from 11. 81% . At one point early yesterday , the issue traded as high as 101 30/ 32 . The government ' s 11 3/4% notes due 1993 closed unchanged yesterday at 100 3/32 to yield 11. 73% . Some analysts said U.S. government bond prices were bolstered a bit by an unusual twist in the proposed purchase of Getty Oil Co. by Texaco Inc . The Sarah C. Getty trust is expected to receive $3. 98 billion from the sale . A highly restrictive provision in the original trust declaration , written in 1934 , appears to prevent the trustee from investing the proceeds from the sale of Getty Oil stock in anything but government securities of the U.S. , Canada , Britain , Sweden , Norway , Denmark and Switzerland . A maximum of 25% could be invested in securities of any one of the countries . In the short-term market yesterday , interest rates were little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 8. 92% bid , the same as the average rate set at auction Monday .
