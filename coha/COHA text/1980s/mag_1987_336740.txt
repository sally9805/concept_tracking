The stout pine coffin containing the body of Miguel Sotomayor Urbina was brought out of the family 's wooden shack and carried through the dusty streets of Managua 's Villa Cuba neighborhood . There was no honor guard and no red-and- black flag draped over the coffin , as there usually is for young conscripts killed in action against the U.S.-backed contras . And the cortege , passing beneath flowering cassia trees , headed not for the military cemetery but for an overgrown burial ground on the banks of a rubbish-strewn gully . " He had n't wanted to go , and dodged the draft for months before he was caught , " said Jose Manuel Alvares , a family friend . " This is the family 's way of protesting his call-up . " <P> As the coffin was lowered into the earth , the protest grew more voluble . " You sons of bitches are killing us like dogs ! " yelled a tearstained pallbearer , pointing his finger at an official of the local Sandinista defense committee . " Just leave us alone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , but it seemed a cry from the heart of a confused and unhappy country , where the promise of the revolution is depreciating as rapidly as Nicaragua 's plummeting currency . Whether the country has been let down by the revolution or , as some would argue , the revolution has been let down by the country , Nicaragua today seems to be a betrayal of all the earnest vows swapped in the sticky July heat of 1979 when Dictator Anastasio Somoza Debayle was finally toppled . <P> In a country where independent opinion polls have been banned since 1981 , any estimates of how many Nicaraguans still support the government are suspect . Yet there is growing evidence that the revolution is down to the hard core of its constituency and still losing friends . " The Sandinistas came to power with the support of 80% to 90% of the population , " says a Nicaraguan intellectual who was once a fervent believer . " Now they would have to scrape to come up with 40% . " The draft and 1500% inflation are eroding the bedrock of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken all our rights , even the right to toilet paper , " says a 20-year-old draft dodger , referring to frequent shortages of basic commodities . " People are tired of their empty slogans and want change . " <P> Those who still believe in the slogans see their faith tested daily . By every economic measure imaginable , the country has become considerably poorer since 1979 . The purchasing power of the average person with a job has declined to less than 20% of what it was in 1980 . Food and fuel are tightly rationed . A few weeks ago the gas allowance , obtained with coupons bearing a portrait of Che Guevara , was cut from 20 to 17 gal . a month . Earlier this year , the government-subsidized rice ration was reduced to 1 lb. a person a month , down from 5 lbs . three years ago . " A pound of rice might feed a small family for a day , " complains Jose Romero Arana at Managua 's sprawling outdoor Eastern Market . " What are we supposed to eat for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revolution 's early gains in health care are vanishing . " Medicine is supposed to be free , " says Maria Arriaga Castilla , nursing a baby in her arms near the town of Ocotal . " But you have to wait so long to see a doctor , and the right drugs are n't always to be found . "
