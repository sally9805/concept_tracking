This has minimized incidents of in-flight hijacking and sabotage , but it has not totally prevented them . And terrorists also have been able , since the late 1960 ' s , to carry out sporadic on-the-ground attacks on El Al passengers , crew members and aircraft that have caused considerable death , injury and destruction. // A close call came in August 1972 when an explosive device went off in the baggage hold of an El Al Boeing 707 that had taken off from Rome , bound for Tel Aviv with 140 passengers and eight crew members. // Officials of the airline said the plane ' s baggage hold had been reinforced with armor plating . This precaution apparently limited the damage to a six-inch-wide hole in the compartment and a small crack in the rear door . The plane returned safely to Rome. // El Al officials are extremely reluctant to go into detail about their much-admired security system . So it can only be assumed that some if not all other El Al planes have been similarly reinforced to limit the effects of cargo-hold explosions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have devices under their wings to protect against surface-to-air missiles by altering their flight through electronic or other means . So far as is known , no ther airline uses such devices . <> <> One Successful Hijacking // Evidently the only time an El Al plane has been successfully hijacked was in 1968 , when members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine commandeered a plane and directed the crew to land in Algeria . The incident ended without injury . Two years later , Israeli air marshals overpowered two Arabs , one a woman , who tried to take over a plane bound from Amsterdam to New York . The plane landed in London with the male hijacker dead from a bullet fired during the aerial gun battle. // The worst airport loss suffered by El Al took place in May 1972 . Twenty-six passengers were killed and 76 wounded in an attack by members of the Japanese Red Army organization at Ben-Gurion International Airport outside Tel Aviv. // At least seven other attacks on El Al personnel or property between 1968 and the double assault yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a hand grenade into an airline office in Athens in 1969 in which a boy was killed and 14 others wounded , and a 1976 attack on a plane preparing to take off from Istanbul in which 4 died and 21 were wounded . <> <> Risk Greater at Big Terminals // The consensus among security experts yesterday , after the airport attacks in Rome and Vienna , was that El Al , like any other airline , was especially vulnerable to attack where all the carriers have counter space in one sprawling building and local authorities must provide security for an area that may be filled with hundreds or even thousands of people. // " In Israel , they have total control over their airport , " said the former security chief of a major American carrier . " But outside Israel , they must defer to foreign governments. // " If someone wants to come into a terminal shooting , there ' s nothing an individual airline can do , " he said . " This is not true in Israel . But what can they do in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much as anyone. " // For travelers who have flown on El Al , memories of the trip usually include a baggage inspection and an interrogation that are remarkably thorough . <> <> Questions in ' Great Detail ' // Two young American women were not allowed aboard a New York-to-Tel Aviv flight early this month until the stepmother of one was called by an El Al security officer five minutes before takeoff time to verify the passengers ' account of their reasons for going to Israel. // Linda Stewart , whose stepdaughter Jennifer was one of the two bluejean-clad travelers ( the other was Katie Leachman ) , said yesterday : // " The man from security went into great detail . He wanted to know what university Jenny had gone to , the purpose of the trip , how long she had known Katie . He was very polite and ended up thanking me and adding that they were just checking . I didn ' t know whether to be reassured or scared out of my socks. " // Two other travelers who went to and from Tel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airport that lasted 45 minutes. // Among the questions frequently asked are : whether the passenger personally did the packing ; whether anyone else had access to the luggage ; whether it contained electronic devices and , if so , where they had been bought , and whether the passenger was carrying a package received from someone else . <> <> Baggage Depressurized // Security experts , declining to be quoted by name , said El Al took precautions that appear to go beyond those of many if not most other carriers . They said that such precautions were understandable because El Al represents a nation that is under constant siege from guerrillas , and emphasized that they were feasible because El Al operates only a fraction of the flights of the industry ' s giants. // El Al passengers are routinely told they must report to the airport at least two and a half hours before scheduled departures to allow time for security procedures. // Baggage destined for the cargo hold is generally given a thorough initial search . In addition , the bags and other cargo are placed inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to simulate the drop in atmospheric pressure as a plane gains altitude . The purpose is to double check that the bags do not contain an explosive rigged to go off when the pressure drops. // Use of magnetometers and X-ray machines to check for weapons on a passenger ' s body or in carry-on luggage is conducted with great care . And the magnetometer check often is supplemented by frisking . <> <> Separate Security at Kennedy // Seven years ago , at Kennedy International Airport , El Al began using a new check-in terminal of its own that is separated by walls from the check-in counters of other foreign carriers in the International Arrival Building . The El Al area is known to have special security features , but an official of the airline declined to discuss them except to say , " In effect we have our own security at Kennedy. " // The implication was that the Kennedy set-up was far preferable to that at other airports like Rome ' s , where the check-in counters are not isolated from those of other airlines and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terminal area. // The security situation for El Al differs from airport to airport , depending partly on the degree of special assistance the airline can obtain from local authorities . In Switzerland , for instance , passengers departing on El Al flights are processed and boarded at relatively isolated areas of the terminal. // One security expert suggested that authorities consider screening passengers , as well as companions seeing them off , at checkpoints set up at the entrance to a terminal. //
