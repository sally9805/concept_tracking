In 1986 , coming out on top was an experience not just for the Chicago Bears and the New York Mets but for another bunch of sometime underdogs : U.S. consumers . At long last , average Americans got measures of economic revenge for many of the indignities they had suffered in recent years at the hands of everyone from Arab oil sheiks to Wall Street 's predatory speculators . For consumers , who had already been savoring three years of economic recovery , 1986 was a time of pleasant surprises and unexpected bonuses . <P> Every season brought something to celebrate . A breathtaking slide in oil prices made gasoline cheaper than it had been since 1979 . Inflation fell so low that it actually ran backward for several months . Even the tax system , of all things , changed for the better when Congress delivered a historic reform law that will lower rates for most consumers and wipe out many of the loopholes long enjoyed by businesses and wealthier Americans . Meanwhile , Government investigators cracked down on Wall Street 's insider traders , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors . <P> But not everyone felt inclined to toast the year . Farmers and oil-industry workers suffered painful contractions in their industries . Thousands of employees in corporate America lost their jobs as big companies cut staff and dumped subsidiaries to limit their vulnerability to Wall Street 's rampaging takeover artists . For Big Business , the attacks by corporate raiders were compounded by withering charges that large corporations have become overgrown and afraid to take risks . <P> Yet when most Americans scanned the business headlines during 1986 , they generally found reasons to be pleased rather than dissatisfied . The best news for everyone was that the economic recovery persevered through 1986 , its fourth straight year , with no apparent signs of coming to a halt in 1987 . The economy began the year with a robust first-quarter growth of 3.8% . The stimulus came partly from a short but intense home-building boom that took off as mortgage rates declined to as low as 9.5% . Sales of new homes surged 24.7% in March , to an annual rate of 924,000 , the highest level on record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 's second quarter , when fears began to grow that the recovery might have run out of momentum . Growth virtually stagnated from April through June , expanding a measly .6% . A primary cause was trouble in America 's farm and oil-producing states , whose woes temporarily dragged down the whole U.S. economy . But the downturn jitters proved unwarranted ; the economy bounced back with a 2.8% expansion in the third quarter and was expected to perform at about that level during the October-December period and all of 1987.
