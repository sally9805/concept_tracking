The allegation against the prisoner , Chen Chi-li , the head of the United Bamboo gang , has been denied by the Taiwanese . It was contained in an affidavit filed by an F.B.I agent in the indictment of 10 Asians in New York on racketeering charges . According to the affidavit , Mr. Chen approved a deal to import 660 pounds of heroin , as well as an attempt to buy a casino in Las Vegas , and was to benefit from both the transactions. // The affidavit , which is said to be based on taped conversations between gang members and undercover officers , does not explain how Mr. Chen could have given permission from a jail cell in Taiwan . Taiwan is under martial law and prisoners are normally strictly guarded. // But Anne T. Vitale , the Assistant United States Attorney in Manhattan in charge of the case , said it was correct to conclude that the Federal Government believed the 41-year-old Mr. Chen had participated from jail. // If the charges are correct , they raise new questions about relations between the gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murder of the writer Henry Liu . Mr. Liu , who was shot to death in the garage of his home in California Oct. 15 , 1984 , had written a critical biography of Taiwan ' s President , Chiang Ching-kuo . <> <> U.S.-Taiwan Relations on Line // " If the affidavit is accurate , it is a deeply disturbing development that could have grave consequences for Taiwan-U . S. relations , " said Representative Stephen J. Solarz , a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs. // " It suggests the authorities on Taiwan have moved from complicity in efforts to intimidate and even kill an American to efforts to poison the American people with narcotics , " Mr. Solarz said . " The ordinary prisoner in Taiwan doesn ' t have access to a telephone . It is inconceivable that the authorities on Taiwan were not listening in to any conversation Chen had. " // An official of the Coordination Council for North American Affairs , Taiwan ' s unofficial mission in the United States , said in reply to questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operated by the Ministry of Justice in a suburb of Taipei . " It is highly impossible , " the official said , that Mr. Chen could be involved in a drug deal in New York. // Another Chinese knowledgeable about the Bamboo gang said he believed Mr. Chen had communicated with gang members in the United States through his wife , who has visited him in prison . The source asserted that many gang members , in a traditional Chinese way , still feel a strong sense of obligation to Mr. Chen as their leader . <> <> Asian-Americans Frightened // Mr. Liu ' s death frightened many Asian-Americans , who said it was a terrorist act by a foreign government on United States soil . At a memorial service in San Francisco on the recent first anniversary of the death , Representative Norman Y. Mineta , Democrat of California , charged that the Reagan Administration was reluctant to pursue the case , contrasting it with Washington ' s reaction to terrorism in the Middle East. // After Mr. Liu ' s death , Mr. Chen and another Bamboo gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentenced to life in prison for the murder . But Mr. Chen left a taped confession in California that accused the head of the Military Intelligence Agency in Taiwan ' s Defense Ministry , Adm . Weng Hsi-ling , of directing the murder. // After gang members in the United States turned the tape over to the F.B.I. , Taiwan arrested Admiral Weng , a former aide to the late Chiang Kai-shek , and then sentenced him to life in prison also. // But in the hurried trials , in which few witnesses were called and little evidence was introduced , it was not clear whether Admiral Weng had planned the murder himself or had been acting under orders from a more senior official . Taiwan has refused to extradite any of the men to the United States . <> <> Widow Sues for $250 Million // Earlier this month , Mr. Liu ' s widow , Helen Liu , filed a $250 million lawsuit against the Chinese Nationalist Government on Taiwan and the convicted men , charging them with murder , racketeering and deprivation of civil rights. // In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Liu contended that the killing was part of a " terrorist conspiracy " to intimidate critics of the Nationalists. // Drawing on Mr. Chen ' s taped confession and the scant evidence at the trials , the suit said President Chiang ' s brother , Gen. Chiang Wego , a senior Defense Ministry official , attended a meeting with Mr. Chen and Admiral Weng in July 1984 , three months before Mr. Liu was killed . At the meeting the men discussed " plans for representatives " of the Bamboo gang " to engage in illegal activities in the United States " on behalf of the Nationalist Government. // One of President Chiang ' s sons , Chiang Hsiao-wu , who is 40 years old , holds an important though not publicly acknowledged post in Taiwan ' s intelligence apparatus and was also a close friend of Mr. Chen , according to accounts in Chinese newspapers in the United States . The younger Mr. Chiang , however , has denied any connection with the murder. // Under Mr. Chen ' s leadership , the Bamboo gang grew rapidly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group to an international organization with 40 , 000 members in Taiwan , Hong Kong , the Philippines , Japan , Saudi Arabia and the United States , according to former members now living in the United States and the F.B.I. affidavit . Because many of its members were the sons of Nationalist officials who fled to Taiwan from the mainland in 1949 with Chiang Kai-shek , the gang operated with relative impunity , combining extortion , gambling and prostitution with some legitimate businesses such as a gossip magazine and a recording company , the former members report . A number of prominent movie actors and directors also joined the organization . <> <> U.S. Aide Speculates on Case // An American Government official familiar with the indictment of the 10 Bamboo gang members in New York said they were expected to contend that their plans to import heroin , cocaine and marijuana to New York and buy a casino in Las Vegas were at the behest of officials on Taiwan , as in the murder of Mr. Liu . The American official said the men might argue that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese Communists in the United States. // Mr. Chen was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the New York case. // A potential key witness to both the murder and the New York case , Tung Kuei-sen , was arrested last month in Brazil at the request of Washington after he was charged in the New York complaint . Mr. Tung , who the authorities in California say actually shot Mr. Liu , also returned to Taiwan last year after the murder but fled before he could be arrested and was rumored to be in the Philippines. // The State Department has begun the formal process of seeking his extradition . One of the many unresolved questions is why , if the F.B.I. knew he was in Brazil , did not the Federal Government press for his arrest on the murder charge sooner. // The F.B.I affidavit asserts that on Aug. 20 , a gang member in Houston , Chen Chih-yi , known as Yellow Bird , called Mr. Tung and directed him to arrange for the importing of 660 pounds of heroin from a gang contact in Thailand . On Sept. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ F.B.I. and New York City police undercover agents to discuss purchasing the heroin , the affidavit says. // The next day , according to the affidavit , Yellow Bird told the undercover agents " that Chen Chi-li had approved of the narcotics transaction and was to benefit from it.
