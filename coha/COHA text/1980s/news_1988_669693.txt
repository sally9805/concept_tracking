About all the victim feels is a momentary sting when the dart or pellet breaks the skin . He ' s unlikely to have built up natural immunity . And an antidote , while available , is fairly rare , and probably not at hand . Even if treatment is available , it ' s difficult to figure out just what insidious toxin is at work - perhaps until it ' s too late. // The substance is rattlesnake venom. // The problem is - or , rather , used to be - collecting it . ' ' Milking ' ' snakes was a time-consuming , unpredictable , and dangerous task. // // For years , the United States government kept only tiny amounts of venom stockpiled for research purposes and producing antidotes . It was also kept for ' ' special operations ' ' by intelligence agencies - in unadorned language , assassinations. // In the American intelligence community , it was commonly assumed that the Soviet Union did the same . Neither superpower , however , seriously considered rattlesnake venom as a weapon to be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it wouldn ' t be effective. // Tiny metal darts , called flechettes , coated with venom could turn a tiny nick of the skin into a painful and ultimately fatal injury , a US intelligence analyst explains . A bomb loaded with them would give new meaning to the term ' ' antipersonnel. ' ' // But , another US official explains , both superpowers calculated that it would be difficult to collect the poison for such a weapon , let alone hide the effort. // Sending out Red Army recruits to milk rattlesnakes in Central Asia ' ' would have a pretty obvious signature ( by satellite ) , ' ' the official says. // But now , both the US and the Soviet Union have the capability to produce nearly unlimited amounts of rattlesnake venom - without ever going near a snake . In fact , the feat has become old hat , a US intelligence analyst says , as technology has advanced at an even faster pace. // Cloning snake venom these days , he says , ' ' is nothing new. ' ' // Cloning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' gene splicing . ' ' A simple , harmless microbe - such as one that ' s common in the human intestine - can be altered so that as it reproduces itself , it also reproduces new genetic material that has been spliced into it. // Cloning is a biological breakthrough that was only dawning 16 years ago , when many of the world ' s nations banned biological warfare . It has opened up the possibility of a new generation of chemical and biological weapons. // It has also spawned a multimillion-dollar military competition , involving the deadliest microbes , viruses , and bacteria known to man . It ' s a race to identify - and protect against - exotic new toxins and biological warfare agents. // Simply put , as mankind ' s understanding of the foundations of material life has increased , so has the understanding of new ways to end it. // ' ' We ' re living through the time of a certain revolution in biotechnology in general , ' ' says Yevgeny Sverdlov , head of the Laboratory of Nucleic Acids Biotechnology at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' And any revolution has two sets of consequences , ' ' Professor Sverdlov says . ' ' One is usually used to raise up the welfare of the people . The other can be used for annihilation. ' ' // Jeremy Rifkin , president of Washington ' s Foundation on Economic Trends , puts it more graphically : ' ' Microbes are the foot soldiers of the 21st century . ' ' The foundation is concerned with the moral and ethical questions of biotechnology , and has filed a number of lawsuits to limit the Pentagon ' s chemical and biological defense research programs. // Most of those programs are conducted openly , but the Monitor has learned that the Pentagon also conducts classified research , the results of which are kept secret . The purpose : to ensure that US protective gear will stand up to new chemical and biological agents that might be concocted by some enemy. // US intelligence agencies claim that 10 countries , including the Soviet Union , are involved in prohibited biological weapons research . Pentagon sources , accordingly , say the US is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat posed by new weapons , and to defend against them. // But there are critics in both the East and West who say the research poses a dilemma : The more military strategists delve into this shadowy area of warfare , the more dangerous will be the knowledge they amass. // US biological research : from bust to boom // THE Reagan years have produced something of a boom for biological defense research in the US . The Pentagon ' s budget for the program rose from $15. 1 million in 1981 to some $90 million in 1986 , according to a study by the majority staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management . Spending has declined in the last two years , but is still about $70 million annually. // The US renounced offensive biological warfare in 1969 , convinced the weapons were unpredictable and inhumane . It converted the biological weapons facility at Fort Detrick , Md. , into a research center. // In 1972 , the US , Soviet Union , and other countries signed the Convention on the Prohibition of the Development , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The convention essentially outlawed biological warfare . It did not , however , prohibit defensive research . Both the US and Soviet Union have maintained extensive defense research programs all along. // Moreover , the convention did not include provisions to verify compliance . As a practical matter , therefore , it is unenforceable . The Pentagon acknowledges that it is creating some disease-causing substances using such techniques as recombinant DNA research . ( See diagram , Page B2 . ) Among them is anthrax , a classic biological warfare agent . It is being reproduced , Pentagon officials say , to aid in vaccine production. // Anthrax , although deadly , has been studied for decades ; much is known about how to combat and treat anthrax infection . ( See story , Page B10. ) // But that is not the case with many of the microbes now under study by the Defense Department . Some have no known antidotes . The possibility that they could be altered , even inadvertently , to make them even more deadly or harder to defend against , is troubling to the Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the possibility of powerful new genetic weapons that could rival nuclear weapons in the future , ' ' says Mr. Rifkin of the Foundation on Economic Trends. // ' ' People think AIDS ( acquired immune deficiency syndrome ) is dangerous ? ' ' he asks rhetorically . ' ' Imagine what could happen if military establishments set out to deliberately create a virus that has no cure. ' ' // ' Novel agents ' - a step beyond mother nature ? // FOR years , the dividing line between chemical and biological warfare was clear : Biological agents could reproduce themselves . Chemical agents could not . But scientists in both the US and the Soviet Union say the line is now blurred by advances in biotechnology . Things that can ' t reproduce themselves in nature can be reproduced in a laboratory . Consequently , a ' ' gray area ' ' is developing between classic chemical warfare agents , such as mustard gas and nerve agents and biological agents , such as anthrax. // Specialists have adopted an imprecise , catchall term for substances in this gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // Among them are : // *Well-known biological warfare agents , such as anthrax , produced by new methods , such as genetic engineering. // *Toxins , like spider venom , previously so difficult to collect that they were discounted as warfare agents. // *Unique mixtures of poisons , resulting in compounds that are potentially more lethal , virulent , or difficult to treat than the component parts. // *Substances that occur naturally in the human body , such as biological regulators and hormones , but that in abnormal amounts can have an unpredictable impact on human life. // * ' ' Low-molecular-weight agents ' ' - poisonous chemicals of such infinitesimally small proportions that they could , theoretically , slip through the activated charcoal filters of a gas mask or protective suit , as air molecules already do. // *Genetically altered micro-organisms that closely resemble known disease-causing agents , but have a critical change in protein structure that renders present-day vaccines obsolete. // Some experts say they worry that ' ' novel agents ' ' could unlock a Pandora ' s box of new problems for arms controllers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' the same old substances , ' ' says Nikita Smidovich , a diplomat in the Soviet Foreign Ministry ' s Department on Peaceful Use of Outer Space and Nuclear Energy . But , he warns , ' ' if we look into the future , there could be things that surpass the lethality of known agents. ' ' // ' ' If you take a toxin - and biotech makes it that much easier to make them - and then apply some biochemistry to it , you start to make something that doesn ' t appear in nature , ' ' says Graham Pearson , director of the British Chemical Defense Establishment at Porton Down , England . ' ' And you start to say to yourself , ' Now , he ( your adversary ) has the possibility of making them . . . too. ' ' // Ake Bovallius , director of the Swedish Defense Research Establishment ' s Department of Nuclear , Biological , and Chemical Defense , laments the ' ' mistrust between states. ' ' // ' ' It ' s a rather small step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . and equipment to produce a weapon , ' ' he says . ' ' In this business , it can move rather fast. ' ' // It is mistrust that has prompted the Pentagon to venture into the eerie world of tailor-made toxins and microbes. // The secret research behind the openness // THE US biological warfare defense program , when compared with the Soviet Union ' s , is a model of openness . Contracts are a matter of public record , and there is extensive documentation of the research in environmental-impact statements and other documents. // In addition , the Pentagon ' s main biological defense research facility , the US Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases ( USAMRIID ) at Fort Detrick , Md. , issues an annual report detailing the research it is supporting. // Still , government documents indicate that the Pentagon is also conducting secret research with both chemical and biological warfare agents . Pentagon sources acknowledge that tests are being conducted to determine if certain substances can penetrate the current generation of US gas masks and chemi // cal protective gear. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Space and Special Weapons Directorate , confirms that ' ' there is a program that ' s not part of the biological defense research program at Fort Detrick. ' ' // It involves testing with simulants ( microbes that mimic dangerous substances but are not themselves harmful ) and novel agents . The test results are not reported publicly . For that matter , General Eggleston says , they are not even reported to the National Institutes of Health , which theoretically oversees the Pentagon ' s biological research. // The reason , he says , is that such research , if publicly disclosed , could be used to target weaknesses in US military protective gear , and that would jeopardize American soldiers. // Dr. Thomas Welch , a chemical and biological warfare adviser to US Secretary of Defense Frank Carlucci , says only that the program is ' ' modest ' ' in scope and conducted safely. // Pentagon officials would provide no further details. // But interviews and examinations of government documents provide details about some of the poisons under the Pentagon ' s microscopes. // Of cobras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawsuit by the Foundation for Economic Trends , the Defense Department revealed that it is researching a veritable rogues ' gallery of bacteria , viruses , and toxins. // Says Rifkin , the foundation ' s president , ' ' They ' re working on every deadly pathogen known to man. ' ' // Among the substances are bacteria like Yersina pestis , the ' ' Black Death ' ' of the 14th century ( see map , Page B2 ) , and tularemia ( rabbit fever ) , which is known to cause blisters , high fevers , and in some cases , death. // Also on the list are virus diseases , including well-known ones like yellow fever and polio , and rare , exotic ones with names like Chikungunya and O ' Nyong Nyong. // The Pentagon also acknowledged in the legal proceeding that it is researching the military uses of toxins from cobras , Mojave rattlesnakes , scorpions , and shellfish. // These bacteria , viruses , and toxins are lethal enough in their own right . But Pentagon strategists say there is a possibility that novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lot - with nightmarish battlefield results. // Eggleston sketches out one possible scenario : // One day , Army medics confront an outbreak of disease that seems like a highly infectious fever . But once they begin treatment , the symptoms suddenly begin to resemble poisoning by snake venom. // Worse , Eggleston says , it is conceivable that the treatment administered for the first symptoms - the fever - could actually trigger the onset of the second - the snake bite poisoning . Treatment would then become a macabre guessing game . <> <> Computer concoctions // EGGLESTON says the Pentagon has even considered the possibility that computers , using artificial-intelligence techniques , could be used to concoct formulas for such deadly potions. // The Pentagon , he says , must try to anticipate such threats , and ensure that US soldiers are protected . Eggleston flatly dismisses the suggestion that there is anything objectionable about the secret research. // ' ' This is a good-news program , ' ' he stresses . ' ' What we ' re doing fully supports our high regard for human life. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dogged by controversy - a fact even its backers acknowledge , but blame on misperceptions. // ' ' When people think of a place like this , they ' re making something of an analogy to a bomb factory , ' ' says Lt. Col. David Huxsoll , commander of USAMRIID at Fort Detrick . ' ' But what we ' re doing here is making drugs and vaccines . ' ' Colonel Huxsoll says such research is , unfortunately , necessary in the modern world . When it comes to biological warfare , he warns , ' ' Right now , the only warning device we have is man. ' ' // Some experts , both in and out of government , are skeptical about the Pentagon ' s biological warfare defense program for an even more basic reason : They doubt that novel agents even exist. // One US intelligence analyst insists that every agent under study is ' ' either a chemical agent or a biological agent . ' ' Even genetic engineering doesn ' t produce unique agents , he argues , but only results in more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stuff is science fiction , ' ' Harvard biochemist Matthew Meselson says of novel agents . He is one of a handful of nongovernmental experts on chemical and biological warfare in the US. // ' ' It isn ' t out there . It ' s exaggerated , ' ' Professor Meselson says. // Moreover , he says , it would be a waste of time for any country to explore new lethal agents when there are already so many in existence. // ' ' Recombinant DNA ( research ) doesn ' t change anything , ' ' he continues . ' ' A cell is still a cell . It can be stopped ( by protective equipment ) . ' ' // That assertion , however , gets at one of the central paradoxes of biological defense research . Nobody can test protective gear without knowing a great deal about the kinds of agents that might be encountered in battle . And the more researchers learn about those agents , the more they know about how to produce them. // How to defend against the unknown ? // ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' offensive and defensive research , says Mr. Smidovich , the Soviet diplomat . But Huxsoll , commander of USAMRIID , contends that only in the case of ' ' very elementary studies , ' ' such as vaccine production , is the line between defense and offense difficult to recognize. // ' ' If you ' re talking about producing greater quantities , or making it more virulent , you ' re talking about a marked difference in effort , ' ' he says . Nonetheless , Huxsoll concedes , ' ' If one has as his agenda the building of a weapon , then let ' s not kid ourselves , it can be done. ' ' // Last year , a study group convened by the Army Science Board reported that it found ' ' no evidence of any R &; D projects . . . intended for offensive BW ( biological warfare ) . ' ' // Still , the thrust of the US biological defense research program troubles critics. // Not only might genetic engineering produce an agent that is ' ' harder to diagnose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosenberg , a researcher at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Rye , N.Y. It might also result in ' ' putting toxins into widely occurring bacteria that could , if they escaped , find all sorts of niches in the environment. ' ' // ' ' There could be an accident , ' ' she warns . ' ' It could get out , and you could have an uncontrollable epidemic. ' ' // Open-air testing // ' THE emphasis of the biological defense research program in the 1980s is provocative and destabilizing , ' ' charges Nachama Wilker , executive director of the Committee for Responsible Genetics , in Boston . To carry out this program , she says , the Pentagon needs the actual agents . And , she adds , it has no business creating those agents. // Such research , she argues , should be transferred to a civil- ian agency that is specifically prohibited from creating novel agents , testing them for the military , or conducting open-air tests with agents or simulants. // Rutgers University researcher Leonard Cole is particularly critical of the Pentagon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needlessly exposed civilian populations , without their knowledge , to actual bacteria that might prove harmful , particularly to physically sensitive individuals . Mr. Cole has documented hundreds of tests , some of them in cities like New York and San Francisco. // The Pentagon says it stopped conducting outdoor tests in populated areas in 1977 , but they are still routine at isolated military areas such as the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah . A Pentagon position paper says the testing ' ' requires the employment of biological simulants that are safe for the employees working with them , the environment , and the general public. ' ' // Private-sector research // PENTAGON-FUNDED biological and chemical defense research takes place not only at government installations in the US , but also at private companies and other institutions. // Contracts for defense research in the private sector involving the use of actual agents totaled about $68 million in fiscal year 1987 , according to a study by the congressional General Accounting Office. // Chemical defense research takes place at some 52 sites in the US , including a number of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 100 sites in 27 states and eight foreign countries. // The biological defense research sites include such prominent institutions as Harvard and Yale Universities , as well as the Universities of Alabama , California , Florida , Hawaii , Illinois , Iowa , Maryland , Minnesota , New York , Texas , Virginia , Wisconsin , and Wyoming . ( Those biological research facilities where the work involves ' ' high hazard ' ' organisms , genetically engineered microorganisms , and toxins are listed at right. ) // Colonel Huxsoll , of USAMRIID , is an enthusiastic backer of funding such research in the private sector . He says it gives the Pentagon access to some of America ' s foremost researchers and facilities. // Last July , however , more than 500 biomedical researchers signed a pledge ' ' not to engage knowingly in research and teaching that will further the development of chemical and biological warfare agents. ' ' // Jonathan King , a professor of molecular biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , was one of the prime supporters of the pledge campaign . He says it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development , growth , and handling of the very biological warfare agents ' ' that the Pentagon fears might be used against the US. // Sometimes , these agents are sent back and forth between research institutes and government facilities . Pentagon officials stress that the shipments are safe . But while chemical agents used for research are , in some cases , delivered in specially chartered aircraft or vehicles with police escorts , biological agents have been handled differently. // Until this year , most of the biological agents were shipped through the US Postal Service . The practice , revealed in a Pentagon document released publicly in July , was discontinued when a furor erupted. // The Pentagon , however , quietly shifted some of the shipments to private couriers , including Federal Express , according to an Army official. // There are , in fact , relatively few legal restrictions on how and where the Pentagon conducts chemical and biological research . There are , for example , no regulations prohibiting research in populated areas. // Safety concerns dog both bio and chemical research // ONE chemical defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is the laboratory of Geomet Technologies , Inc. , in Gaithersburg , Md . Under a Pentagon contract , Geomet conducts research with such substances as nerve agents and mustard gas. // The amounts are small ; Geomet is prohibited by law from keeping more than one liter ( 1. 06 liquid quarts ) of each dangerous substance on hand . They are stored in special high-security vaults when not in use. // Nevertheless , across a roadway from Geomet is the Washington Grove Elementary School . Pupils pass near the Geomet laboratory on their way to and from classes. // A Geomet official would not comment on the company ' s activities . In the past , however , the official has stressed that the lab does not pose a hazard. // The Pentagon does publish extensive safety guidelines for contractors that handle chemical warfare agents . Nevertheless , a report by the General Accounting Office this year found that the Defense Department had not ' ' systematically assessed ' ' the consequences of , say , a fire in a laboratory. // In testimony before a congressional subcommittee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaithersburg-Washington Grove Fire Department , revealed that firefighters had an unusual standing order in the event of a fire at Geomet. // They were , he said , not even to enter the building. // There is conflicting evidence on the overall safety of the Pentagon ' s own chemical and biological testing facilities. // The Monitor obtained copies of the Pentagon ' s ' ' chemical incident log ' ' for the past five years . They contain only six accounts of accidents ; most represented nothing more serious than minor blisters from contact with mustard gas. // But the Army inspector general earlier this year concluded that the Army ' s chemical warfare research program ' ' suffers from a lack of published policy guidance , inadequate staffing , no systematic program of oversight , and a less than clear statement of chemical safety responsibilities . ' ' Last year , an Army Board of Investigation found ' ' a significant number of problems in the environmental , safety , and occupational health arenas ' ' at Aberdeen Proving Ground , the nation ' s main chemical warfare research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among them a laboratory with a ' ' gaping hole in the ceiling , ' ' and emergency telephones that took several minutes to get a dial tone . It found that ' ' conditions . . . particularly in regard to personnel safety and hygiene , are deplorable. . . . ' ' // This year , the majority staff of the Senate Subcommittee on Oversight of Government Management ' ' uncovered serious deficiencies in ( the Defense Department ' s ) management of safety issues in the ( chemical and biological warfare ) research program , including inadequate regulations , lax safety enforcement , and documented safety lapses . ' ' The report concluded that ' ' Congress should not rest easy. . . . ' ' // Suspicion of Soviets // A MAJORITY of Congress has repeatedly been convinced , however , that chemical and biological defense research is necessary . One key reason : suspicion that the Soviet Union is secretly conducting research on offensive biological warfare and beefing up its formidable chemical warfare capability. // The specific evidence to back up these claims is classified . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and congressional sources - as well as a study of Defense Department documents - yield some insights into the US ' ' threat assessment. ' ' // US intelligence agencies say they have confirmed the existence of two facilities where the USSR is conducting biological warfare research : the Microbiology and Virology Institute in Sverdlovsk , and the Scientific Research Institute of Sanitation in Zagorsk . They have identified at least six other ' ' suspect ' ' sites , at Omutninsk , Aksu , Pokrov , Berdsk , Penza , and Kurgan , as well as a storage facility at the Soviet city of Malta . The Pentagon also says there is a biological warfare test facility on Vozrozhdeniya Island in the Aral Sea . ( See map , Page B5. ) // Intelligence analysts say there is , in all likelihood , biological warfare research taking place at other prestigious institutes in Moscow , Leningrad , and Novosibirsk . They admit , however , that at most of the facilities , other research in medicine , pharmaceuticals , and agriculture also takes place. // The Soviets themselves , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Defense conducts research with various biological warfare agents at laboratories in Sverdlovsk , Zagorsk , Leningrad , Kirov , and Aralsk . But the USSR maintains that all the facilities are involved in defensive research only , not offensive , and certainly not in weapons production. // An informed source says that the Soviet Union is conducting research on toxins , including poisons produced by blue-green algae . The US has also charged the Soviets with developing anthrax , rabbit fever , plague , and cholera as bacteriological warfare agents. // Suspicion about just what the Soviets are up to pervades the American intelligence community . Official Soviet secrecy only feeds speculation. // An odd building in Moscow // One facility that particularly intrigues US experts is the Shemyakin Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry , on the outskirts of Moscow . Some United States officials suggest that offensive biological warfare research is conducted there. // But so little is known about the institute that even the shape of the building is a matter of fascination to intelligence analysts . Some think it ' s merely a gigantic example of architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building , seen by satellite , resembles a huge DNA molecule . ( See drawing above. ) // In an interview at the facility , Professor Sverdlov , the head of the Institute ' s Laboratory of Nucleic Acids Biotechnology , says the suspicions about the facility are unfounded . ' ' In this institute , I want to stress , we don ' t work on biological weapons. ' ' // But can he affirm that such research isn ' t under way elsewhere in the USSR ? Here , his answer is curiously qualified : // ' ' In this place , the Academy of Sciences , I may state definitely that none of my colleagues are involved . And the Academy of Sciences is the place of work for the most distinguished scientists . So , I can say none of the really outstanding scientists of the Soviet Union are involved. ' ' // ' ' This is mere logic , ' ' Sverdlov says. // ' ' Without the involvement of leading scientists , it is impossible to develop this technology . So the next conclusion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work is under way in the Soviet Union. ' ' // Even more troubling was a 1987 statement by Valentin Falin , then head of the USSR ' s Novosti Press Agency . He was talking about Moscow ' s response to new , US space-based weapons systems. // ' ' We won ' t copy you anymore , making planes to catch up with your planes , missiles to catch up with your missiles , ' ' Mr. Falin said . ' ' We ' ll take asymmetrical means with new scientific principles available to us . Genetic engineering could be a hypothetical example . Things can be done for which neither side could find defenses or countermeasures , with very dangerous results . . . . These are not just words . I know what I ' m saying. ' ' // Falin later tried to clarify the statement . But Huxsoll , of the Army ' s Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases , had the words set in type ; he hands out copies to visitors to his office at Fort Detrick. // In the end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses is not only a question of prudence - but also a question of morality. // ' ' If we have any suspicion that these things are going to be used , then I don ' t have a moral problem with research to protect against these potential threats , ' ' he says . ' ' I think it would be immoral if we didn ' t protect against them .
