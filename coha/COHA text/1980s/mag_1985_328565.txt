When an oscillator aboard the $50 million NOAA-8 weather satellite turned balky last June , the craft began tumbling out of control in its polar orbit . Without power , its systems shut down . All seemed lost , but a determined band of controllers from NOAA ( National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ) , NASA and RCA refused to give up . Over the next ten months and on hundreds of occasions , they beamed radio signals at the errant craft , trying to revive it . <P> The odds they faced were formidable . The signals could reactivate the tumbling satellite only when its solar panels faced the sun , which provides the power need- ed to run the craft 's transmitter , and when the oscillator could be turned on long enough for it to stabilize . This un- likely confluence actually occurred in late April . After the controllers reprogrammed NOAA-8 's computer , they reoriented the satellite and restored its power . Last week the rescue team was testing the craft 's onboard systems in preparation for returning it to full service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply a matter of keeping at it . "
