$ We at TIME are usually credited with having invented group journalism , the application of many minds to one story . We 'll accept that credit , but we 're equally proud of another tradition : when an individual writer or correspondent has something special to impart , we make space on our pages for that writer 's words alone . This is true of weekly stories , and also of regular columns . Since 1973 Hugh Sidey has written a column for TIME on the presidency as seen from his own special perspective . For twelve years Tom Griffith has dispensed his seasoned views on the press in his Newswatch column . <P> This week another columnist of formidable stature debuts in the World section under the title America Abroad . The author is Washington bureau chief Strobe Talbott , who has unraveled the complexities of foreign policy in a wide variety of TIME stories since 1971 . Twice a month America Abroad will offer readers a regular opportunity to read one of Washington 's most perceptive observers of foreign affairs . Says World editor James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complicated issues in a manner that is lucid and provocative . " <P> Talbott plans to use the column as a vehicle for both reporting and taking his own stands . " While I think of myself as essentially a reporter , I have strong views on most matters too , " he says . Talbott 's choice of subject will often reflect his credentials as an expert in U.S.-Soviet affairs and as the author of three books chronicling the past twelve years of superpower arms- control diplomacy , but he plans to vary the scope of America Abroad . He will weigh in at times with topical examinations of news events , step back on other occasions to take a historical perspective and devote a column now and then to one compelling personality . <P> Hot off the presses : TIME 's second book , The Winning of the White House 1988 . Written by five TIME staffers who covered the campaign , edited by special projects editor Donald Morrison and introduced by historian Garry Wills , this concise inside story is the first book-length chronicle to reach the bookstores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Read it for the definitive account of how George Bush won .
