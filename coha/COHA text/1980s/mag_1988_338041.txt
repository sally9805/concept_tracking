For nearly two centuries , selective breeding has been used in an effort to produce Thoroughbred racehorses that are faster and have greater staying power than their forebears . At stake is not only the conformation and temperament of the horses but the many millions of dollars spent these days by owners and fans on the sport of racing . Yet according to a report in last week 's Nature , the British science journal , today 's Thoroughbred racehorses do not run much faster than their great-great-grandsires did . What is more , they probably never will . <P> The reasons , argue two Irish researchers at the Agricultural Institute and Trinity College in Dublin , stem more from basic physiological constraints on size and swiftness than on the failings of equine genetics . Says Barry Gaffney , a co-author of the report : " It 's quite possible from our data that horses may have reached the limits of their speed . " <P> All Thoroughbreds the world over are descended from three stallions imported to England from Arabia and North Africa around the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have mated only the best with the best , producing such proud champions as Eclipse , Man o ' War and Secretariat . For generations , only 6% of all male horses in Britain and the U.S. have been used for breeding . Still , racing times have not improved dramatically since 1910 . In the meantime , human Olympic runners have become at least 20% faster than their turn-of-the-century counterparts . Could it be that racehorses are overbred and that there is not enough variation in their gene pool to produce faster animals ? <P> Geneticist Gaffney and Colleague Patrick Cunningham set about trying to answer that question in 1985 . For 18 months , they pored over the handicap ratings for 31,263 British racehorses . After evaluating the performance of every three-year-old in Britain from 1966 to 1985 , they confirmed that the best horses were not getting any fleeter , but the pack was running faster . Their conclusion : though the gene pool was improving , the top horses had reached their physical limit . <P> Horsefeathers , say critics . Poultry and livestock bred under similarly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses are n't getting any faster , it makes one wonder what horse breeders have been up to , " comments William G. Hill , professor of animal genetics at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland . Thoroughbreds need new blood , he suggests , and breeders should consider mating them with other kinds of horses . <P> What seems logical to the scientific community , however , may be anathema to the racing world . Crossbreeds are automatically disqualified from the most prestigious competitions , such as Ascot and the Kentucky Derby . Dramatically different training does not seem to be the answer either . Although human runners have improved through intense physical training , " you ca n't explain to a horse why it should train harder , " says Brough Scott , a British horseman and author . An overtrained Thoroughbred simply goes sour . " Horses tend to be like a machine , " explains James Rooney , head of veterinary science at the University of Kentucky . " About 40 m.p.h. seems to be their top velocity . " All of which may make picking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
