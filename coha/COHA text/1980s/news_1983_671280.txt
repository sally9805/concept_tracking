Miss Barcelona is typical of hundreds of suburban career women who are changing the traditional patterns of volunteerism in their towns . A decade ago , when homemakers started pouring into the paid work force , it was feared that they would abandon service organizations and volunteerism . But instead , according to leaders of women ' s organizations , working women are changing the focus and structure of the service agencies to make them more relevant and accessible to their new lives. // <> <> A Wish to Remain Connected // Part of that desire to to do volunteer work , say the women , stems from a wish to remain connected to their communities , which is difficult for commuters . " It ' s an opportunity to keep in touch and put down roots , " said Janet Jones-Parker , an executive recruiter in Connecticut who recently agreed to serve as a board member of the Greenwich Y.W.C.A. as well as vice president of the Greenwich Advisory Council on Youth and Drugs. // Others , temporarily out of the work force , say volunteer groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to use in future careers . Mary Lou Petitt , housing director of the New Jersey League of Women Voters , says she would never have qualified for her new paid position as housing consultant to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs had it not been for her 10 years of volunteer service in the housing field with the league. // <> <> A Need for Nurturing // Interviews with dozens of professional women said volunteer service satisfied a need for nurturing they said they could not usually duplicate in the commercial world . " We ' ve even had some of our old members come back , " said Hope Diggs , president of the Women ' s Club of Ridgewood in New Jersey . It is now not unusual , she said , for a businesswoman to devote one or two lunch hours each week to the club ' s meals-on-wheels program . That kind of direct participation is particularly popular , organization leaders said. // National membership in the General Federation of Women ' s Clubs , a group that suffered volunteer losses in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is on the rise again . That group had dropped from a high of 650 , 000 members in 11 , 600 clubs in 1972 to fewer than 500 , 000 two years ago . During that time , about 600 clubs closed their doors. // <> <> Record Memberships // The Association of Junior Leagues posted record national membership last year with a total of 152 , 000 women , up from 107 , 000 in 1972 . Hadassah , long viewed as the quintessential service organization of the suburban Jewish homemaker , now has a record 370 , 000 members across the country , compared with 318 , 000 10 years ago . <> <> Neither Hadassah nor the Junior League suffered attrition because women were entering the work force . But the complexion of the groups has changed markedly in the last 15 years . The age of incoming members in the Junior League , for example , is now 31 , compared with 21 in 1972 . The reason , organization leaders say , is that so many younger women now devote all their energies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full time and going for my M.B.A. degree when I was in my 20 ' s , " said Patricia Matteson , director of marketing for Merrill Lynch Relocation Management in White Plains . " There was just no time left over for anything else . " It was not until she was in her late 30 ' s that Mrs. Matteson joined the Junior League in her hometown of Southport , Conn . She is typical of the new breed . Nationally , 36 percent of all league members now also hold paid jobs , compared with 14 percent in 1973 . And because they are joining later , the age limit for new members has been raised from 40 to 45. // <> <> More Elderly Women // Officials at Hadassah have found , however , that while the overall number of volunteers is encouraging they can not always attract the same type of women , " the kind who used to fill the top leadership positions , " said Roslyn K. Brecher , chairman of public relations for Hadassah . Those women " are the ones becoming the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Women Voters , which is still suffering from lower membership compared with a decade ago , now draws much of its strength from elderly , retired women. // " We ' re the ones who can afford the time , " said Helen Back , who in her 70 ' s has just completed two terms as president of the Southbury , Conn. , chapter . " And we are in much better health at a later age , " she said. // Similarly , the women serving in traditional volunteer positions in the schools are more likely to be grandmothers than mothers . " Older women now make up the bulk of our regulars , " said Elaine London , coordinator of volunteers for the White Plains public schools . " They ' ve taken up the slack. " // National figures on the number of elderly women volunteering in the schools and on the number of volunteers in general were not available . Officials of the United States Department of Education , the Administration on Aging , the American Association of Retired Persons and the Bureau of Labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vance Grant , head of the statistical information office at the Department of Education , said , " So many people volunteer on such an informal basis that we don ' t collect this sort of information. " // The Center for Women ' s Studies at Radcliffe College in Cambridge , Mass. , also said it did not have national statistics . The Washington office of the General Federation of Women ' s Clubs said it was beginning a major project to establish a clearinghouse for statistics and archives on women who are volunteers. // <> <> Groups Are Undergoing Change // Because the background , availability and age of the new female volunteers are different , the groups themselves are undergoing fundamental change . Ann B. Hoover , president of the Association of Junior Leagues , is now supporting three major changes in the organization : short-term instead of yearlong service assignments to accommodate the career woman who has seasonal pockets of time to give rather than regular hours each week ; greater flexibility of meeting times and shorter agendas that can fit into lunch breaks or evenings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do not require personal meetings. // The new volunteers ' experience is also expected to alter some portions of the mandatory training course . Many professional women entering the league , for example , find it unnecessary to attend a workshop on how to run a committee meeting. // The General Federation of Women ' s Clubs is using the political sophistication of many of its career women to mount more lobbying efforts on concerns such as environmental and child-development issues . The federation is also offering expanded programs in leadership and career planning . " This way we can be of service to our own members in need as well as the community , " said Juanita Bryant , international president of the group. // No longer satisfied simply to serve in support positions , women are also changing traditionally male-dominated volunteer positions . About 28 percent of the delegates to the 1984 General Conference of the Lawmaking Assembly of the United Methodist Church will be women , compared with 13 percent in 1972 . " Before it was mostly men on the board of directors of the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York City . " Now one third are women. " // //
