Chicago  --  For a prominent art museum in a major American city , in an era of flamboyant museum expansion , the Art Institute of Chicago has gone about its recent building program with considerable modesty and restraint . No international competition was held nor team of experts assembled to choose the architect for the museum ' s new 128 , 000-square-foot wing . Instead , the Art Institute ' s president , James Wood , and a group of its trustees privately interviewed several Chicago-based architects who know the city and the institution . They decided upon 46-year-old Thomas Beeby of the firm Hammond Beeby &; Babka . He had grown up in Chicago , established ( and still maintains ) a practice here and served as director of the architecture school at the University of Illinois in Chicago before becoming dean of the architecture school at Yale . Officially opened this month , Mr. Beeby ' s South Building is the Art Institute ' s largest single addition . It is said to have more gallery space in itself than the whole of either the Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minneapolis . In its temporary exhibition space , it is currently housing the immense Gauguin show organized by the Art Institute , the National Gallery in Washington and the Reunion des Musees Nationaux in Paris . And its three floors of galleries , the top two of which are organized around a central , daylit sculpture court , are providing previously cramped or neglected parts of the museum ' s collection with generous new accommodations . All of this is virtually unnoticeable from the street , tucked into the museum ' s surviving 19th-century building , which still serves as the primary entrance to the complex . Mr. Wood has described this building as almost " touching " in its innocence , its embodiment of Midwestern cultural aspirations and deference to Europe . It was designed by the venerable Boston firm of Shepley , Rutan &; Coolidge for the 1893 World ' s Columbian Exposition , with the understanding that afterward it would be used as a museum . It was one of the earliest of the palacelike Beaux Arts museum buildings that eventually dotted the country . And one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the bevy of plaster casts of European statuary sent over by the French government for the exposition . Mr. Beeby ' s solution for the 1988 building was to mix this history with invention . Respecting , and even reinforcing , what is best about the Shepley , Rutan building , he designed a logical , ceremonial structure that still conveys considerable warmth and has a human scale . And it is still very much a modern building . Inside , he used Indiana limestone for the piers and balustrades and Dolomites limestone for the floors of the sculpture court . By bringing in ample daylight from above , Mr. Beeby has created a pale , pristine , luminous central space ( although someone might want to rethink the fussy greenery that is sprouting from little planters at the lower level ) . And he has animated the space with fluted marblelike columns that look almost weathered and that have abstract capitals painted in circles of silver and gold . The connected 20th-century galleries that circle the court on the upper level are elegantly proportioned , also daylit from above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the walls , oak floors and subtly painted moldings . Full-height windows offer a dramatic view of the Chicago skyline as well as , in the foreground , the Illinois Central Railroad tracks that piquantly punctuate the hodgepodge of previous additions to the museum . ( The only rude note on this level is the shop that has been set up at the entrance to the temporary exhibition space , clearly meant to ambush visitors coming in and going out . ) By comparison , the lower gallery levels look like afterthoughts , repositories for art that isn ' t such good box office  --  American paintings , objects and furniture on the second floor , European Decorative Arts on the third . These nether spaces aren ' t underground but they seem to be , since they have no windows , no natural light in the galleries , and the sculpture court doesn ' t extend down to the scrunched-up third level , where it might have served as an orienting device . Also , because the stairways have been purposely suppressed rather than used as " events , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the third level seems a bit like creeping into the basement . All of this is wrapped , however , in a dignified and understated skin ; and , considering how much it houses , the building , somehow , looks small from the outside . Mr. Beeby obviously did not set out to astonish the world or to declare his own presence . Instead , he gave the South Building solid masonry walls of pale Indiana limestone that are unadorned except for the hint of pilasters and that have teak doors and window frames already in the process of bleaching out to match the color of the stone . The Art Institute ' s efforts to reorganize and reinstall its collection and to join old and new ( there has been , for example , a meticulous restoration of the Beaux Arts entrance hall by the Chicago architect John Vinci ) are continuing . There is still much to be done . But the institute ' s latest venture augurs well for the future.                @ @ @ @ @
