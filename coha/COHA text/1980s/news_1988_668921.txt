Ron Gerhardt says the upturn in the aluminum industry can be measured in the extra bales of beer and soda-pop containers coming through the doors of his Evansville recycling business . U.S. aluminum makers , buoyed by high prices and a worldwide shortage of products , have recovered mostly from the depths of a slump two years ago and are posting record profits . Tzschoppe Industries Recycling sends more than 10 , 000 pounds of aluminum a week to Aluminum Co. of America ' s nearby Warrick Operations , the largest aluminum smelter in the United States . " Recycling started kind of as an oddity , but now it ' s getting to be the normal thing to do , " said Gerhardt , company president . The aluminum turnaround is welcome news in the lower Ohio Valley , where aluminum producers , lured to the region by plentiful coal supplies and excellent river transportation , have put three smelters within a 40-mile radius . The plants represent about 16 percent of the country ' s aluminum smelting capacity . Pittsburgh-based Alcoa is completing a 4-year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar program is underway at the company ' s Alcoa , Tenn. , smelter just outside of Knoxville . Other nearby smelters include National-Southwire Aluminum in Hawesville , Ky. , and Alcan Aluminum in Sebree , Ky. , where $15. 5 million in plant improvements have begun . The company shut down four production lines in 1985-86 . " Aluminum was going down the same path as steel was in the 1980s , " said Mike Deshaies , Alcoa spokesman in Indiana . " So we started cutting back the high-cost , low-profit end of the business . " Alcoa , the nation ' s largest producer , announced a 25 percent reduction in smelting capacity three years ago . Other producers took similar steps and closed less-efficient plants and idled production lines . " The industry was trimming down to fighting weight , so to speak , " said Frank Rathbun , spokesman for the Aluminum Association in Washington . Foreign countries with large reserves of raw material or electric power , a major cost component of aluminum , could produce the metal more cheaply . But recovering aluminum prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago to around $1. 20 in late July , have generated record profits for some of the producers . Alcoa reported profits of $416. 3 million , or $4. 71 a share , in the first six months of this year , up from $200. 1 million , or $2. 25 a share , for all of 1987 . Sales in the first six months of this year were $4. 59 billion , compared with $7. 77 billion for all of 1987 . Reynolds , of Richmond , Va. , reported net earnings of $204. 9 million , or $3. 84 a share , in the first half of this year , almost as much as the $219. 5 million , or $4. 33 a share earned in all of 1987 . First-half revenue was $2. 65 billion , while sales for all of 1987 were $4. 32 billion . Labor unions that agreed to concessions during the slump also have noticed the boom times and will be looking to share in the profits when they negotiate their next contract . The current two-year pacts with the United Steelworkers of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowered benefits by 95 cents an hour for their members at Alcoa and Reynolds . Talks on a new contract are scheduled to begin Monday in Cincinnati . The old pacts expire May 31 , 1989 . " This is a very good time from the standpoint of bargaining , " said Larry E. Sigler , president of Local 104 , which represents workers at the plant near Evansville . While celebrating the boom , industry leaders are cautious about competition from steel producers and also warn that metal prices are cyclical . A weakening of the Western economies that use aluminum in housing , containers and construction could send prices tumbling again . No one knows how long the good times will last . " If you find 15 aluminum analysts in New York who want to talk to you about what ' s happening , you ' ll come up with 17 different explanations , " said Alcan spokesman Stan Lampe.
