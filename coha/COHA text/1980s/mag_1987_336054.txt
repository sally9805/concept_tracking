South Africa 's gold and coal mines are in the best of times harsh places where thousands of blacks live in crowded hostels far removed from their homes and families . The mines were closed to journalists last week as a long-threatened strike , the largest in South Africa 's history , began . But the walkout was scarcely three days old before stories of trouble started to spread . <P> At the Blinkpan colliery , police arrested five miners in connection with the strangulation of a black worker who defied the strike call . At the Harmony mine , owners fired 74 miners who were said to have damaged the underground telephone system and harassed other workers . At an Anglo-American Corp . plant east of Johannesburg , police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to evict 300 protesters . Later in the week , police fired birdshot at strikers at an Optimum coal mine , injuring at least 27 miners . <P> About half the nation 's 550,000 black mineworkers walked off their jobs , and at least a third of the mines were seriously affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Union of Mineworkers for an across-the-board 30% increase , compared with hikes of 15% to 23% granted by the Chamber of Mines , which represents the six largest employers . Until now , according to the union , the average black worker has made $170 a month , while employers claimed the figure was $274 . Both sides agreed that the average black miner earns only about one-fifth as much as the average white miner . <P> While the country fretted over the continuing strike , State President P.W . Botha announced that parliamentary elections scheduled for 1989 would be postponed until 1992 . The move was presumably aimed at giving Botha a chance to press ahead with what he regards as his reform program before having to face another challenge from far-right opponents . <P> At the same time , Botha unleashed a strong attack on the 61 white moderates who last month flew to Dakar , Senegal , for talks with leaders of the banned African National Congress . " Let Dakar be a lesson to all South Africans , " thundered Botha in Parliament . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , he warned , the government will maintain tighter control over the issuance and renewal of passports and will set up a commission to look into the activities and funding of organizations like the Institute for a Democratic Alternative for South Africa , the antiapartheid group that planned the trip to Dakar . <P> The government 's hostility to the 75-year-old A.N.C . stems in part from that organization 's attempts to undermine the apartheid system through a campaign of sporadic terrorism . Now there is increasing evidence that Pretoria is engaged in a campaign of retaliation against the A.N.C . ' s leadership . Last month Cassius Make , a member of the A.N.C . ' s national executive council who was visiting Swaziland , was gunned down by assassins . According to A.N.C . officials , Make was the eighth congress member or sympathizer to be killed in Swaziland this year ; an additional six have been abducted to South Africa . In the most bizarre incident of all , two Zimbabweans and two Britons recently arrested in London were alleged to be agents planning to kidnap A.N.C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packing crates .
