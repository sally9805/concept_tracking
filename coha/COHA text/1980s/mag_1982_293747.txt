Scratch a photojournalist and you will find a reporter who wields a camera instead of a typewriter . Eternity in a moment , information plus aesthetics . These are the obsessions , and in time of war , the obsessions are intensified . But suppose they gave a war and no photojournalists were invited ; a war in which the only war pictures may be some chance shots caught by amateurs ? <P> Such has been the Falklands situation , where the British and Argentine military authorities , not to mention the remote location of the islands , have made the job of the world 's photojournalists frustrating in the extreme . One of the few who have succeeded at all is Sygma Agency Photographer J.C . Criton . On assignment for TIME , Criton was able to get on and off the Falklands two weeks ago and send his pictures out of Argentina . His vivid photographs of Argentine troops and weapons on the Falklands were a highlight of last week 's TIME . They were the only recent color pictures from the occupied islands to reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this highly visual age . In response , the photo editor declares a kind of all-out war of his own . In New York , TIME Picture Editor Arnold Drapkin and Picture Researchers Peter Kellner and Robert Stevens assigned photographers to wherever they suspected a picture might conceivably develop . In England , Picture Researcher Brenda Draper posted photographers to the Prime Minister 's residence at 10 Downing Street , the Ministry of Defense , and places like the naval shipyards in Portsmouth and Plymouth . From Buenos Aires , Picture Researcher Nina Lindley positioned photographers in key locations throughout Argentina . <P> In this atmosphere , just about every photographer dreamed of executing a stealthy airborne pass over the Falklands . Last week another Sygma photographer and some television cameramen gave it a go by chartering a small private plane . The idea was daring , the result predictable : the plane was fired upon by the Argentines . A prudent and hasty retreat followed . As Master Photographer Alfred Eisenstaedt once said , " If you are a reporter , you can be 500 miles behind the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has proved to be quite a problem .
