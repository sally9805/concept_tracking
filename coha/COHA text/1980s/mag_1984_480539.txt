But since the United States obviously can not influence the status quo , why does n't it attempt to influence change . .. for a change ? EVOLUTIONS in Latin America pose challenges to American diplomatic imagination . Lessons from the past have not been learned . The problem for the future is how to achieve some balance between the nationalist fervor , the anti-American rhetoric , and the internal transformation , on the one hand , and , on the other , normal diplomatic relations , cool-headedness in dealing with provocation , and constant political action through the multilateral organizations , the major Latin American nations , Japan , and Western Europe . IN OCTOBER 11 , 1983 , guests at London 's distin-guished Grosvenor House who frequent the hotel be-cause it is one of the few remain-ing bastions of proper innkeeping were either behind bolted doors or at the front desk complaining about the howls that ricocheted through the pale green lobby . Pranksters had piled furniture into corners ; entire floors had become hospitality suites , wildernesses of fast-flowing bars populated by tuxedo-clad men down-ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in London , A. Craig Copetas is at work on a book about Marc Rich and the world of the commodities markets . and Grosvenor House was the site of the annual dinner of the London Metal Exchange , an influential commodities market . Until dawn 2,000 metal buyers and sellers from Boston to Beijing ? some of the industrial world 's wealthiest and most powerful men ? reveled like a convention of Moose Lodgers . The hotel staff , accustomed to the yearly dinner and all-night cocktail party , handled the behavior they had come to expect with true Tory breeding and dispatch . They calmly defused the South African gold trader who tried , unsuccessfully , to drive a truck into the lobby , and they tamed the roaming packs of communist-bloc executives who flashed fat rolls HARPER'S/JANUARY 1984 38 of dollars in front of any woman with the tenacity to remain in the open after midnight . " This is cirrhosis week , a very trying and difficult time for all of us , " chuckled the group 's chairman , Michael Brown , before going in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved with the London Metal Exchange . " The " barbarians " at the exchange 's blowout are part of a tightly knit tribe of capitalists who generate trillions of dollars by quietly controlling the buying and selling of the earth 's crust . The drama of their lives is centered on the cost and the availability of metals like copper , tin , and tantalum , strange-sounding lumps of earth called ferro-molybdenum , chambishi cobalt , and wolfram-trioxide ; their edge on life is a canny understanding of how to make hundreds of millions of dollars while paying a minimum amount of taxes . The men who traveled to this year 's conclave to toast their prodigious wealth , however , radiated the tawny hues of fear . Their craftiest colleague , Marc Rich , had been slapped with a fifty-one-count indictment by the U.S. government . He was accused of racketeering , mail and wire fraud , and violating a trade ban with Iran . One of the world 's greatest metal traders had been charged under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization ( Rico ) statutes , laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was now liable to pay the IRS a back tax bill of $90,433,574.39 . All in all , the air in Grosvenor House that October evening was reminiscent of a Chicago speakeasy , with patrons who would make excellent witnesses for the prosecution . It was not the staggering amount of money Rich owed in back taxes for a handful of deals conducted within the space of three years that concerned these dinner-jacketed gentlemen . Their fear arose from the fact that one of their own had somehow allowed the secret world of financial shadows to be breached , to be put on public display in the seedy confines of Manhattan courtroom number 128 . TOMACHS churned out of control from the moment Rich was subpoenaed last June , and traders must have been consuming a bottle of Maalox a day in August after the world press gleefully reported that customs agents at Kennedy Airport had stopped a plane meant to ferry two large steamer trunks chock-full of secret corporate documents from Rich 's New York office to the safety of Swiss vaults .

" Everyone in this business has dealt with Marc Rich , " said a metal broker who has executed millions of dollars ' worth of deals with him . " The last thing we want is the U.S. poring over records that might outline our activities . We do not want people to understand how we operate . " Ironically , Marc Rich was the most secretive of all the metal merchants . He kept a low public profile while personally orchestrating the hour-to-hour activities of a $10-billion-a-year corporate trading giant that dealt in metals , oil , weapons , sugar , and grain . He speculated on prices , juggled metals like casino chips , and gambled billions to seize control of large caches of strategic commodities essential for manufacturing goods as disparate as cereal and jet fighters . Marc Rich , say those who worked with him , wanted to be a cartel . Rich knew about the velocity of money , about keeping your money in a state of perpetual motion in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who know him joke that lists of the world 's richest men exclude him only because they have no formula with which to gauge his total worth . They also say that he is so self-confident that he was not in the least disturbed when in July he had to flee the United States to Switzerland in order to avoid indictments that could lead to a jail sentence of 325 years . People who have dined with him , his wife , and their three daughters at his Park Avenue apartment , which once belonged to Helena Rubinstein , say that he did not even blink over paying $4 million in government fines , at the rate of $50,000 a day , to prevent a federal court from gaining access to his sensitive corporate files . The government admits that it does n't know where all the assets of Marc Rich are buried , despite digging through 200,000 pages of subpoenaed documents .

ARC RICH 'S empire operates through an international hydra of traders , revolving Swiss bank accounts , and cleverly sculpted Panamanian corporations with nonsense names like Highams Consultants and Rescor Incorporated . In nine years he managed to nurture a global business colossus that may sell more oil than Kuwait , more copper than Chile , and enough aluminum to wrap the British Isles in foil . He owns 50 percent of 20th Century-Fox and controls GORCO , an oil refinery in Guam that sells jet fuel to the U.S. Air Force and petroleum products to the entire Seventh Fleet .

Over 8,000 companies have been lured to Zug by lucrative tax concessions and the promise that they could be considered Swiss firms if they simply screwed a brass nameplate into the wooden door of a local law office . But Rich came to Zug in force and took great pains to shape every nuance of his private financial nation . The canton 's chief public prosecutor , Dr. Rudolph Mosimann , served on the board of Marc Rich AG . The canton 's finance director , Georg Stucky , publicly proclaimed to the Swiss newspapers that Rich was being " blackmailed " by the United States . In Switzerland he was a local hero and became one of the country 's leading employers , while in the United States he was branded an international lout who had been paid millions by the Iranians during the months that Americans were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet deal : American citizen Marc Rich was headquartered in Switzerland , but conducted his business activities from a U.S. corporation nestled in the penthouse of Manhattan 's Pia-get building . The U.S. corporation Marc Rich International was in essence a subsidiary of Marc Rich &; Co . AG , the Swiss parent . Although Rich paid U.S. taxes on Marc Rich International , the structure of his corporate juggernaut allegedly allowed him to defer boxcar loads of American-made profits to Zug . So much money , in fact , that the Justice Department believes Rich could be assessed for over $200 million in back taxes if the Swiss would allow it to subpoena his overseas records . Rich 's 1,400 employees in forty offices in thirty countries are forbidden to mention his name in public ; all meetings with the press , social or otherwise , are forbidden . Even those who have left his company in the wake of the U.S. indictments gingerly refuse to give details of Rich 's activities for the record because , according to sources once close to the firm , its bonus scheme is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and former employees do n't want to be cut off for collaborating with government or journalistic probes . M ARC RICH 'S life is shrouded in secrecy , and the details of even his early years are hard to pin down . He is the only son of a man who is believed to have made burlap bags and dealt diamonds before he fled Antwerp for America to escape the Nazi persecution of the Jews . David Rich moved the family to Kansas City in 1944 and then to New York City in 1950 . He raised enough money to put his son through the private Rhodes School , from which , according to school records , Marc graduated in 1952 . Marc Rich then studied marketing at New York University for two years . Somewhere between his graduation from Rhodes and his dropping out of NYU he made the acquaintance of Steven Dale , a former British commando who was the tungsten expert at the multinational trading firm of Derby &; Co. , an enterprise managed by Philipp Brothers , the largest commodity outfit in the world . Dale soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If you want to become a trader , then learning the business from a tungsten expert is a great way to get started , " explained a leading London metal dealer . " The metal is so strategic that it 's used in every type of armament from a bullet to a tank , and it 's the only item openly brokered between China and Russia . The power , the politics , and the money of the trading world is all there in that little piece of rock . " It appears that Dale convinced Marc Rich to become a trader and later helped him get a junior position at Philipp Brothers . The bottom-line education and grooming of the man who would one day be the target of the largest tax evasion case in U.S. history was provided by a clannish group of mostly German-Jewish metal traders at Philipp Brothers . Now known as 40 Phibro-Salomon , the company remains the world 's largest and perhaps most influential commodities firm , trading everything from South African platinum to Dakota wheat . It 's the kind of company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " create a situation . " Phibro 's stockpiles of raw commodities are so vast that its dealers can create a worldwide shortage or glut of any particular commodity by simply transmitting a Telex to purchase or dispose of material . The company 's former chief executive , Ludwig Jesselson , treated Rich like a son . Under Jesselson 's tutorship Rich learned to tame the volatile world of tin prices , for instance , by going to Bolivia to deal with the military junta and coca-leafchewing peasants . Rich traveled the world for Jesselson , and made dozens of friends in the international industrial community . He would visit factories and drink with managers in an endless succession of hotel bars . He would never forget an anniversary or a birthday , and made sure that the Christmas envelopes were fat . Soon Jesselson placed Rich in charge of the firm 's Madrid office , a strategic location that allowed Rich to work his trading magic on Europe , Africa , and the Middle East . His personality , associates say , put Rich ahead of the hundreds of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in the way of nickel or what Poland 's future copper requirements would be . Rich learned how to get his hands on shiploads of Zambian cobalt , Moroccan copper , Russian chrome , and Yugoslav bismuth . He also learned about oil . In the late 1960s and early 1970s the OPEC nations began gobbling up oil fields from the big petroleum companies . Jesselson figured that his company , by virtue of its friendly and profitable associations with the OPEC cartel , could easily move in as a middleman between OPEC and the West . The move would bring Phibro into an area that had been almost exclusively controlled by the oil giants . It was high-risk , but the money that stood to be HARPER'S/JANUARY 1984 gained made it worth a roll of the dice . Jesselson contacted Rich in Madrid and the two men decided that Iran would be the first target in their oil gambit . Rich developed his contacts with Iranian chrome dealers into access to large tracts of Iranian crude . The payoff was swift . During the 1973 Arab oil embargo Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that propelled Phibro into the world 's largest spot oil trader . Rich 's work made him due for a bonus of over $1 million , the largest bonus in Phibro 's history , according to traders familiar with the company . Jesselson was outraged over the figure and implored Rich to forget about the bonus since he was heir apparent to Jesselson 's own job . But Rich , say those who know him , became livid . He flew to Switzerland , where Jesselson was on a skiing holiday , and demanded the bonus . Jesselson told Rich to go back to the office . " The story may be somewhat apocryphal as to exactly what Rich did next , " a London trader explained . " It 's generally believed that Rich went to a coin box in the Zurich airport , phoned Madrid , and closed an oil deal on his own that netted him $10 million . He then phoned Pinky Green another Phibro employee and told him to quit that afternoon because they had enough capital to start their own company . From that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had only one goal in mind : grind Phibro into oblivion at whatever cost . " R ICH 'S FORTUNES bloomed . He continued to travel the world , buying copper , lead , tin , zinc , oil , sugar , aluminum , and rice from producing nations and quickly selling them to consumers . His own network of traders were given huge incentive bonuses . They would purchase the titles to materials that had yet to enter the harbor . They sold metal to foundries and developed their own system to sell oil to refineries . Rich 's new outfit , Marc Rich &; Company , began guerrilla raids on Phibro . He hired away dozens of traders and their secretaries . His senior staff was instructed to do whatever necessary to pound a spike through Phibro . Marc Rich secretaries were dispatched to " date " Phibro traders ; industrial moles were recruited in Phibro offices . " Anything was possible if it screwed Phibro , " said a trader who had an opportunity to observe one raiding party . " Rich wanted to get his hands on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection . The trader was flown from Kingston to London , driven to his penthouse hotel suite in a Rolls , and arrived to find naked hookers prancing around the room . " Women , cocaine , cash ? it did n't matter as long as Phibro was put out of business . " By the mid-1970s Rich seemed to appear like a Saudi sheik wherever there was an oil deal to be made , often to the embarrassment of the American oil companies . Big Oil , which was used to purchasing crude directly from the producing countries , squirmed when dealing with Rich . He had become a prickly thorn it could not remove because of the nationalization of foreign wells . When Exxon wanted access to oil in Marxist-controlled Angola in the mid-1970s , executives set up a meeting with the country 's oil agents . Expecting to receive a politburo of Angolan officials , senior Exxon executives were stunned when the " communist " representative turned out to be Pinky Green . Rich 's deals did , however , sometimes spiral out of control . In 1979 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil deal in Ecuador . To ensure an edge on the competition he also began providing weapons to the Ecuadoran government , acting as an agent for a manufacturer . The man who brokered the deal was Edmund Mantell , the executive in charge of Rich 's Southeast Asian operation from offices in Bangkok . The situation became explosive for Rich because he was also purchasing oil from Peru , which at that time was involved in a border war with Ecuador . But Mantel ) , a German who sources assert also brokered arms for Rich throughout the Third World , managed to stabilize the sensitive situation through promises and payoffs . " It was just a little border skirmish that was easily contained , " a British oil broker explained . Mantell 's life , however , was more difficult to contain . He was found bludgeoned to death in a Monte Carlo alleyway last August . Police said he had been tortured . Mantell 's associates said that the murder was not random , and that it was probably linked to some deal in some forgotten war . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to surround himself with to maintain a grip on hundreds of different metal markets . He had proved his worth on more than one occasion . In 1981 he assisted Rich in pounding out an agreement to represent Malaysia 's state-controlled tin company , the Malaysian Mining Corporation . They sculpted a curious arrangement with the country 's prime minister to buy all of Malaysia 's tin , stockpile it in Singapore , and push up world prices . It sounded like a good deal , since tin prices had been evaporating and Malaysia was feeling the drought . The deal went down in June 1981 and prices skyrocketed from a low of $4.33 a pound to over $7 . But in less than a year prices dropped and Rich took a $60 million bath because he had neglected to sell . The Malaysians lost $150 million and ended up with somewhere in the neighborhood of 60,000 tons of unwanted tin . " Rich 's feeble attempt to corner the world tin market by trying to buy all of Malaysia was a dumb move but not a real disaster , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this business are stuck with tons of unwanted metal every day . Rich made a deal , like a lot of us do , that did n't work . What 's important is that he made a deal , and a rather large one . This business is about creating situations and that 's exactly what Rich knows how to do . If you think that the money is what 's important , you 're wrong . The deal is what 's really important . You can always find money . But you have nothing unless you have a deal to go along with it . " " It 's kind of sad that he got caught , " laughed a trader with a shrug of his shoulders . " Now you 're going to want to know how we all get away with it . " ARRETED away two flights above a greasy spoon on London 's Tudor Street is the consulate of the Republic of Panama .

" It is to this dilapidated room that they flock to be cured of the affliction known as taxation . Sitting behind an old wooden desk , underneath a tattered map of the Republic of Panama , is an attractive secretary with the ability to exorcise the demons of the IRS . The liturgy is simple : " May I please have information outlining the formation , operation , and taxation of corporations under the laws of the Republic of Panama ? " one asks . The secretary hands you a thirteen-page document and says : " You can choose your own name to be incorporated or I can provide you with a selection of titles already incorporated in Panama . When you make your decision please return with $1,650 . " " Will you take a check ? " " Cash only , " she says . The U.S. government believes that Marc Rich was a frequent visitor to numerous Panamanian consulates around the world , establishing dozens of " Sociedades AnOnimas " structured to prevent anyone from following the movement of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said a metal trader who funnels millions of dollars his U.S. company earns overseas into Swiss and Dutch banks through two So0 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? , , 42 ciedades AnOnimas and a similar corporate scheme offered by Liberia . " It 's just smart business practice to avoid paying money that the U.S. has no business asking for , " he said . If someone has a Panamanian corporation , he can conduct legal business transactions in any country , have a small percentage of his profits declared as taxable income ( to avoid government scrutiny ) , and pay the rest to the corporation , whose owners are considered sacredly secret under the laws of Panama . The corporate money can then be filtered into any number of foreign banks whose by-laws also ensure secrecy . Panamanian corporate law is particularly helpful to a businessman with deals in several different countries . Any Panamanian corporation that operates outside of Panama is not required to file financial reports or tax returns and may maintain its books in any manner it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a procedure generally known as laundering . For a billion-dollar metal dealer like Marc Rich , it 's quite the bargain at $1,650 plus a $50 annual franchise tax . Corporate frameworks similar to that of Panama are aggressively marketed to metal traders by the governments of Switzerland , Singapore , Uruguay , the Bahamas , and the Cayman Islands . " The trick to establishing a successful metal trading business that can operate worldwide is to ensure that a substantial amount of your capital is hidden , " advised a metal trader who was then being assisted in camouflaging potentially taxable income in Switzerland by Arthur Moussalli , the managing director of Geneva 's Business Advisory Service , which peddles Swiss secrecy laws to businesses . " Our deals involve so much money and so much speed that we could not afford to conduct a substantial portion of our business without having a perfectly legal foreign banking and corporate structure to cushion us from prohibitive tax rates , " he added . " Since many of the companies we do business with also have secret foreign accounts and corporations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be exchanged between two secret accounts to avoid taxation . Depending on the circumstances involved , another portion of that money can be exchanged on a different set of books established for purposes of American , British , or whatever country 's taxation . " MORE expensive and complex swizzle is to go out and buy a bank . A few days before this year 's LME dinner , at a time when every metal trader in the world was wandering around London figuring out ways to avoid being baked in the afterglow of Marc Rich , a large ad appeared on the business page of the International Herald Tribune . The ad had been placed by a man who said his name was Josephson . He offered a " Tax Haven Bank ... priced for quick sale at $60,000 . " Josephson , who claimed to be an American , held court in the bar of Knightsbridge 's Basil Street Hotel , a sleepy place usually reserved for wealthy tourists . But the characters who streamed into the lobby during metal week were not simply Americans in search of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of owning a bank , " Josephson hectored while nursing a tall scotch and water . " The U.S. does not afford privacy to its citizens . Whose damn business is it how much money Marc Rich had ? Whose damn business is it how much money anybody in any business has ? " Josephson had traveled to London to dispose of a bank void of any currency or ownership controls that he had established in the Cayman Islands . It was a bank like any other bank , with the ability to issue checks , letters of credit , or cash from a street-corner money machine . The Cayman Islands , he explained , would allow anyone to open a bank if he could produce initial deposits of 5250,000 . Once the structure was established , however , the owner could pull out his $250,000 and sell the bank to the highest bidder . And the bidders for Josephson 's bank were flocking to the Basil Street Hotel like cardinals to the Sistine Chapel to elect a new pope . " Even in international business it takes days to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitedly . " Nobody in the world can use that money while it is being cleared except the bank . With your own bank you can keep the money working for you and you alone .... You can create your own impenetrable world ! " ARC RICH spent his life brewing deals that percolated money throughout layers of secret accounts , private banks , and corporations protected by foreign governments . He owed no loyalty to any country . His world had become a prism ; he could refract and displace billions upon billions of dollars through dozens of countries and companies until they , like light , finally disappeared from view . After leaving Phibro in 1974 he rode the metal bandwagon , sidestepping the politics of nations by acting as a maverick middleman between producers and consumers . But the tightly spun global network he created with a phone call from the Ziirich airport could not prevent the oldest and most simplistic of all criminal investigation techniques from unraveling his labyrinthine corporate mysteries . Marc Rich , in the end , was caught because the government found a snitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself been indicted for shady business practices and who offered up information on Rich in return for reduced charges for himself . In 1980 and 1981 Rich and his partner Pinky Green allegedly created an oil racket that deposited over $71 million in Switzerland to avoid domestic taxes . The bamboozle , according to the U.S. government , consisted of two separate deals that provided a bonanza of profits for the two men . The first deal was amazingly simple . Rich purchased $200 million worth of oil from Iran with money he had in bank accounts in London , Paris , 43 and Zurich . The transactions took place at a time when American companies were forbidden to deal with Iran because of the hostage crisis . Rich operated out of New York , but the money flowed to Iran from Switzerland . London traders say that Rich would probably have gotten away with his alleged 6.2-million-barrel backdoor oil deal had it not been for a second blatantly illegal scheme . While he was dealing with Iran Rich also scooped up oil from old domestic wells , oil that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He then supplied the oil to West Texas Marketing of Abilene and Listo Petroleum of Houston . Both companies , the government contends , were in cahoots with Rich . West Texas Marketing and Listo Petroleum sent the S5-a-barrel oil on a daisy chain , a process that propelled the cheap oil through dozens of shady transactions that ended with the controlled oil selling at upward of $20 a barrel . The daisy chain was so complicated that it seemed unlikely that a government agency could trace the oil 's passage . When the price of the oil reached its ceiling , the Texans sold it back to Rich 's New York company . The New York company then middle-manned the $20-a-barrel daisy-chained oil to a host of domestic petroleum companies at the highest possible spot price . The agreement between Rich and the Texans , according to the government , required West Texas Marketing and Listo to return $70 million in pumped-up controlled-oil profits to Zug after taking a cut . The taxes on the profits were effectively evaded when the Texans transferred them to Rich 's Swiss parent company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rich 's double oil deal was one of many shuffles conducted by commodity traders every day of the year in every commodity imaginable . Traders explain that there exists a built-in risk factor whenever such deals are forged , inherent problems that the smart trader will finesse . So when the Justice Department concluded its eighteen-month investigation into the activities of Marc Rich International , Rich and his sidekick Pinky Green eluded the federal collar simply by buying two first-class tickets to Switzerland , leaving a zealous team of U.S. prosecutors to wrangle with the problems of extraterritoriality . " You Americans have a tendency to consider firms that are controlled by Americans but domiciled in foreign countries to be under U.S. jurisdiction , " explained Matthias Krafft , a Swiss official . " For us , Marc Rich is a Swiss entity under Swiss jurisdiction . We can not accept that an American authority has the right to compel a company located in Switzerland to provide information to the U.S. government . " The Swiss were further outraged by the Justice Department 's roughshod attempts to spirit Rich away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so bent on having Rich behind bars that it failed to invoke two treaties that would possibly have allowed prosecutors access to Rich and his documents . The failure of the Justice Department to put these treaties into action alarmed and offended the Swiss to such an extent that the Bern government said that release of the papers would now constitute " economic espionage " by the United States . ARC RICH , his friends and colleagues will tell you , was a good citizen . He paid taxes , just not enough of them . He was a true American . Money delighted his soul but pay-ing governments for his enjoyment made him angry . At times he may have outraged his colleagues , but he was a force to be admired and reckoned with because he built a company that delivered on time . And the metal men knew that Rich could create a situation . Rich 's ul-timate situation may well be the fact that he is now a Spanish cit-izen , ironically welcomed with open arms into a socialist country whose former dictatorial regime he helped support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to know , " said a trader in rhodium , " how he set that deal up . " Even in his own world Rich remains an enigmatic figure . Some people believe that he was driven by his hatred of Phibro , others that it was simply the power money buys that fueled him . But once the tales true and apocryphal are removed , the froth of indictments and accusations whisked away , you are left with a simple scrap merchant ? a rag and bone man , as the British call their junk dealers . It 's a profession born in the back streets of the Industrial Revolution , in the effluence of factories , where tired immigrants pulled junk-laden wooden carts with the hope of making a few cents selling discarded metal to a furnace in another town . Rich simply traded in the rickety wooden cart for a Telex machine . He mastered the rough-and-tumble realities of junkyard deals , heavy-mannered , bare-knuckled business techniques not offered in the Harvard Business School prospectus . Traders admired Rich because he was able to dismantle the sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nations and their corporations . Like the old junk dealers who left no garbage heap unturned in their search for discarded lead batteries , zinc cathodes , or copper pipes , Rich explored , and took advantage of , every opportunity that would add to his power , influence , and prosperity . " Only a scrap dealer would have the guts to take on the U.S. government over what is his and what is theirs , " a metal trader who comes from three generations of rag and bone men boasted . " If Rich ultimately wins he 's a hero . If he loses he 's a martyr . " " The man is still trading millions of dollars every day , " another trader said in amazement . " Can you comprehend that ? We 're all scared of maybe going down with him but we 're still trading with him . He has to trade . " In the metal world trading is a process no individual or government can contain with laws or prison cells . There will always be another deal , another situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
