I would like to remind employers who are looking for people to fill entry- level jobs ( ( ECONOMY &; BUSINESS , July 20 ) ) that there is a group out there with disabilities who are ready and willing to work . My son is 20 , mentally retarded and gainfully employed at McDonald 's in Bakersfield , Calif . His functioning level and self-esteem have shot sky-high , and his employer has a dependable , capable employee who is happy to be working at any wage . <P> Wilma Sweeney <P> Tehachapi , Calif.
