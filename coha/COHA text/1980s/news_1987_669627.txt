Cronkite had real staying power in the role of fantasy candidate for president . So did Iacocca . Brokaw ' s momentary occupancy of the slot earlier this month shows that network anchor is a good stepping stone to glory. // // Gorbachev is the latest - and best - of a line of communist-bloc leaders who , like Politburo member Frol Kozlov in the 1950s , were said to be capable of ' ' running General Motors ' ' had they been born in a different place . ( GM ' s board might like to grab Gorbachev and send Ross Perrot to run the Kremlin. ) // All of which is a circuitous way of announcing that this column is going to split in two this week and talk about both Bill Cosby ' s TV family sitcom and the next act in the very serious drama scripted by Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. // Let ' s throw journalistic orthodoxy to the wind and start with the next step in arms control , before turning to TV. // It ' s likely that the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so without tacking on major disabling reservations . That ' s a desirable end. // Ultra-conservative arguments that the treaty ought to be heavily amended make no sense. // The only result of such an amendment would be : ( 1 ) to convince Western European leaders and publics that Washington is terminally fickle and untrustworthy . ( First asking them to accept missiles , then asking to remove them , then fiddling with the removal . Such behavior could push many Europeans in the direction of neutralism , undermining the NATO alliance. ) ( 2 ) To give Moscow a reason to renounce the treaty , leaving both sides ' missiles in place. // There is , however , sense in the plea of the European and American right that no deep cuts in long-range strategic missiles take place without using that disarmament as leverage for fair reductions in conventional forces ( and safeguards on chemical weapons ) in Europe. // That position is , in fact , not monopolized by tacticians on the right side of the spectrum . It is advocated by centrists and some progressives as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Kissinger to Democratic chairman Les Aspin of the Senate Armed Services Committee. // There is a risk in tying deep cuts in long-range missiles to conventional force cuts . Such a link would substantially slow down another linkage - the US-Soviet ' ' grand compromise ' ' that Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Reagan hope will lower the risk of both accidental war and ' ' first strike ' ' vulnerability. // Both men , while still differing , pin their hopes for a major fourth summit in mid-1988 on arriving at such a Grand Compromise . ( A Grand Compromise would trade off balanced heavy cuts in various types of offensive long-range missiles in exchange for a slowdown in Reagan ' s timetable for testing and deploying of a defensive missile system. ) // Some conservative politicians in the West would like to see conventional arms bargaining tied to the Grand Compromise package to kill it by delay . Others are genuinely concerned that all kinds of first-strike capability , including tank warfare , be sharply reduced in an Even Grander Compromise between East and West. // Each course has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on conventional-force reductions . Waiting for an Even Grander Compromise risks delay that could see Mr. Gorbachev ' s momentum and maneuvering room undermined during a change of administrations in Washington. // On the whole , the risk of delay seems acceptable . Mr. Gorbachev ' s Politburo colleagues seem likely to continue giving him more latitude on foreign policy and arms bargaining than on domestic reform . He won ' t happily agree to a bigger package including conventional forces . But he won ' t give up dealing with the West either . Mr. Reagan ' s successor might lose the services of the redoubtable Paul Nitze as an arms savant . But the most likely candidates for next president would carry on the general course of bargaining set by Messrs . Reagan , Shultz , Nitze , Gorbachev , and Dobrynin. // Now for Bill Cosby. // Martha Bayles , a normally estimable reviewer in the Wall Street Journal sank her teeth this week into the Cosby TV show , and clones that comedically salute family life. // Her argument is a version of a familiar litany : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie plots . Usually this argument plays the other side of the street , saying that films saturated with mayhem and careening cars don ' t promote sadism and crazy driving in real life . In this case , Ms. Bayles urges that films picturing happy ( if occasionally perturbed ) family life neither ( 1 ) mirror nor ( 2 ) influence the widely deteriorated family life of 1980s America. // Ms. Bayles bemoans the cheery humor of the Cosby family in contrast to the gritty reality of divorce-prone , unwed-mother-troubled US. // It seems to me this line of argument misses the point . Any American with one eye open knows from news , documentaries , books , neighbors , and the Census Bureau that marital and family life are not what they should be for large numbers of citizens . The impact of the Cosby serial arises precisely because it shows a way out of such decline . Its unspoken theme : deterioration need not be pre-ordained and irrevocable , for black or white Americans. // In short , Cosby ' s Huxtable family is a role model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for straight families that often need more guidance in interpersonal relationships than is apparent to those outside the front door . That ' s the reason for its persistent No. 1 rating in the US , South Africa , and elsewhere. // What it says about children talking things out with parents and vice versa is transferrable to real life . It works . It works for intact families , for single-parent families , and for children commuting between divorced parents. // //
