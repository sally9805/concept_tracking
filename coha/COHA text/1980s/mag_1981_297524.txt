DEBTS OF HONOUR <P> by Michael Foot <P> Harper &; Row ; 240 pages ; $13.95 <P> It is as if Tip O'Neill had published a series of erudite feuilletons on such figures as Hawthorne , Henry Adams and William Randolph Hearst ; or Howard Baker had come out with a sheaf of witty commentaries on the likes of Whitman , Santayana and Bernard Baruch . Michael Foot is , after all , not a professional man of letters . He is a politician , the leader of Britain 's Labor Party , and , as such , his country 's shadow Prime Minister . <P> Such stateside equivalents are almost beyond imagination . On their feet , American politicians may have commanded a vigorous rodomantade , salted with the Bible and tall tales . But sitting down to write , few since the founding fathers have proved to be on more than speaking terms with the language ( a present-day exception : Daniel Patrick Moynihan ) . The British Parliament , on the other hand , has always been a veritable academy of accomplished scribblers , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston Churchill-and now Foot-attest . This may not necessarily make for better politics , but it is surely a comfort to the mother tongue . <P> The best of these biographical and literary essays flash with the fervor and assurance of a man nurtured on late Victorian intellectuality , steeped in 1930s radicalism and tempered by more than 30 years on Fleet Street . He makes no apology for his bookishness : " Men of power have no time to read ; yet the men who do not read are unfit for power . " He draws a charming portrait of his father , who passed on his bibliophilia , and a colorfully contradictory one of his father-figure , Lord Beaverbrook . Foot reminisces warmly about his exasperating fellow journalist Randolph Churchill , but repeats the remark that he " should not be allowed out in private . " He sketches a learned dissertation on the political significance of Disraeli 's novels and states the case for Hazlitt as England 's Shakespeare of prose . <P> Rather , he overstates the case , as he does most of the time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not resist eulogizing them any more than he can resist retroactively converting them , even the most unreconstructed Tories , to socialism . In the process , he unabashedly reveals himself as something that many a politician would not readily admit to being : human . - By Christopher Porterfield
