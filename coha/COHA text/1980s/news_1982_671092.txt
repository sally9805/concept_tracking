The induction ceremony at the annual formal dinner , which was held last week in a private dining suite of Windows on the World in the World Trade Center , is generally the highlight of the year for the organization , which they describe as the only women ' s gastronomic society in the United States . Incoming members receive silver bracelets , actually napkin rings , bearing the society ' s monogram , and become part of an elite group of women who write and teach about food and who cook professionally. // Les Dames , seven years old and with 98 members , has as its aim the furtherance of careers in gastronomy for women . It has established scholarships for women at the Culinary Institute of America , Cornell University and the City University of New York , and it is preparing to catalogue the vast and scattered culinary collection of the New York Public Library . Some members compare the group to the French organization of female chefs , Association des **26;58;TOOLONG , formed in 1976. // Chapters have been started in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of " creating viable organizations to further other women ' s careers , " according to Mary Lyons of Foods and Wines From France , who has been nominated to be the next president of Les Dames d ' Escoffier. // This year ' s setting could not have been more felicitous . The 45 members and their 50 dinner guests , most of them men , were cloistered in the Manhattan Prospect , a luxurious room overlooking the city from the 107th floor of the World Trade Center . Their dinner was a reconstruction of a feast as the legendary Auguste Escoffier might have done it , " given today ' s lighter sauces , " according to Alan Lewis , director of Windows on the World . He researched the meal , which was prepared by Henri Boubee , the head chef at Windows. // Those assembled had not yet been served la Selle d ' Agneau aux Cerises Flanquee de Sa Garniture , the " troisieme assiette , " though its accompaniment , a 1973 Cote Rotie from Domaine Gerin , had been poured when Miss Chalmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and president of the organization second , Miss Chalmers was wearing her red and black tartan scarf - a " Clan Chalmers , a sept of Clan Cameron , " she said later - looped over the bodice of her white gown . She called the meeting to order with a Robert Burns poem : <> Some hae meat , and canna eat , And some wad eat that want it ; But we hae meat , an ' we can eat , And sae the Lord be thankit. // Polite applause , as the saddle of lamb , marinated in red wine with carrots and juniper berries and served with a tart sauce that included freshly cooked cherries , was being served. // Then Miss Chalmers and the membership committee summoned the new members to a small platform beside the head table , to which they came singly to accept their bracelets . The ceremony was brief and simple . " Welcome to all of our new members , " Miss Chalmers said. // At a table somewhat apart Marilyn Hansen , food editor of Family Weekly , whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a guest that in the past each " dame , " as she was inducted , had received not only the bracelet but a Halston-designed napkin that is usually worn about the shoulders. // " What happened ? " Miss Hansen inquired . " Are we forgetting tradition ? Maybe we ' re doing things differently , but I do think there is a place in our organization for ceremony. " // Over plates of cheese and a Chateau de Malle 1975 , the discussion , subdued and hushed to be sure , went on , continuing through la Surprise de Ces Dames en Marmite Glacee with les Friandises de Soiree ( a nougatine casserole filled with mango sherbet , served with plums poached in Armagnac ) and Colombian coffee. // Helen Studley , co-owner of la Colombe d ' Or restaurant , recalled that when she became a member three years ago " there were ballerinas dancing around offering little packets of breads and petits fours , two pianists played Chopin waltzes - it was enchantment. " // Miss Chalmers explained that there were two factions , one favoring simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal dinner that has been the practice since the group ' s inception . She added that some members felt that ornate trappings surrounding induction should be done away with ; according to someone on the membership committee , the decision to have a simpler ceremony " simply evolved. " // Miss Lyons , recalling that the first investiture was at the French Embassy and that " there was reason initially to establish seriousness , " said that at inductions into other wine and food organizations " ceremony made them memorable . " She added that she favored formality at least once a year - what she called " continuing the trappings of good-humored seriousness. " // By the time the Armagnac appeared in balloon glasses , the discussion had subsided , at least for the evening , replaced by unanimous and good-natured appreciation of the efforts of Mr. Boubee and Mr. Lewis , who said he had learned his trade " under Escoffier ' s disciple , Louis Diat , at the old Ritz-Carlton here in New York. " // That , after all , was closer to the evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things be made simple , or at least simpler . His slogan was : " Faites simple. " //
