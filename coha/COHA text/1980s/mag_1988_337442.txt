What Liberia and Panama are to the oil tanker , Delaware is to the U.S. corporation : a friendly , light-taxing home port . Some 180,000 corporations are based there , at least on paper , including 45% of those listed on the New York Stock Exchange and 56% of the FORTUNE 500 . So when Governor Michael Castle signed new antitakeover legislation last week , the impact reached far beyond Delaware 's borders . Among its provisions , the law requires that takeover artists who buy between 15% and 85% of a Delaware-registered company wait three years before selling off assets or merging the target firm with another one . The effect will be to tie up raiders ' money and make financing tougher . Delaware felt compelled to adopt the legislation partly because 32 other states already offer similar protection . <P> Backers of the Delaware law , which passed with only one dissenting vote , say it will not prevent friendly mergers but will ward off hostile attacks whose only purpose is a quick profit . Raiders like T. Boone Pickens contend that the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , not all corporations are pleased : Black &; Decker and Canada 's Campeau Corp. , two companies currently making multibillion-dollar takeover offers , have already begun to challenge the Delaware law in court .
