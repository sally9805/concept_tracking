 | All Jeanie Joshua wants is to keep on living . For six years Jeanie has been dependent on a dialysis machine to purify her blood ? an indispensable process that her weakened kidneys are no longer capable of performing . Three days a week , she undergoes four hours of treatment that keep her tethered precariously to life . But Jeanie 's case is different from that of the other 90,000 Americans whose dialysis care is also a life-ordeath matter . For each treatment , this 39-year-old Ojai , Calif. , woman must travel 140 miles round-trip ? no doctor closer to her home will accept her as a patient . Americans have long embraced an affectionate image of doctors ? dependable , considerate , compassionate . And while most physicians do care about the people they treat , some nevertheless choose to decline to care for particular patients , often those they consider " difficult " ? overly demanding , hostile , hypochondriacal , lawsuit-prone , or afflicted with serious contagious diseases such as AIDS . Or doctors may be repulsed by patients they consider weak-willed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and alcoholics often fall into these categories . In most cases , doctors will make a " diplomatic " referral when they do n't want to work with a particular patient . Other times , however , they will bluntly dismiss a patient in a brief , unfriendly conversation or by letter . Do doctors have the right to refuse to care for some patients ? Most doctors believe so . The American Medical Association 's code of ethics firmly states that doctors can " choose whom to serve " as long as they do n't abandon the patient , leaving him or her without any care . The one exception : an emergency situation in which the patient needs immediate attention . Through Jeanie Joshua 's eyes , her situation could n't be much more of an emergency . In 1979 , Jeanie was diagnosed with lupus , a disease in which the immune system turns on the body 's own cells , sometimes impairing the internal organs . For the next few years she continued to lead an active life , but in 1983 her kidneys gave out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the supervision of Dr. Michael Fisher . But the machine 's purification system was not operating properly for some six months . As a result , her red blood cells were destroyed , she became extremely anemic , and she was forced to undergo frequent transfusions . Jeanie sued Dr. Fisher . Nonetheless , another area nephrologist , Dr. David W. Doner , Jr. , agreed to accept her as a patient . But her medical problems persisted , and last year she was hospitalized for five weeks with a fungal infection . Then , because another home dialysis machine malfunctioned , Jeanie missed a treatment ? and nearly died . Rushed to the closest hospital emergency room in her town  | she was in desperate need of dialysis . But Dr. Doner was out of town and , according to Jeanie , the nephrologist covering his cases delayed admitting her to a dialysis unit for nearly two hours . Jeanie is convinced she was denied care because of her legal action against Dr. Fisher . " My life was on the line , " she says , " and hesitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covering nephrologist announced he would no longer care for Jeanie , Dr. Doner decided she was more than he wanted to handle . Within weeks of the incident , he sent her a letter pointing out that no nephrologist in the area would back him up in his care for Jeanie , thus preventing him from ever going out of town . As a result , he wrote , he would no longer provide care for her as of November 4 , 1988 . And , in fact , no other nephrologist in the area would take her as a patient . Jeanie , who is now forced to commute three hours three times a week to a kidney dialysis center in the San Fernando Valley , has taken legal action to force the resumption of local treatment . " Medicare pays for kidney dialysis because of its very high cost , " says Jeanie . " These doctors are being paid by the government , and I think I have the right to be cared for within my geographical area . " There has been a volley of charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the physician has found other nephrologists to cover for every one of his kidney dialysis patients except Jeanie . And , he says , Dr. Doner found Jeanie " extremely difficult to deal with . " She refused recommended tests , he says , and she took an " illicit " medication she obtained in Mexico . Jeanie , in turn , argues that the drug in question was an antibacterial agent sold over-the-counter in Mexico that she took to battle her fungal infection . " Jeanie is a conscientious patient , " her husband , Sholom , stresses , and " she has never been reckless . " Have the doctors involved in Jeanie 's care acted unethically ? " If in fact there was a conspiracy among health professionals in the area not to care for her because of a prior malpractice suit , " says Dr. Kathleen A. Nolan , a medical ethicist at the Hastings Center in Briarcliff Manor , N.Y. , " or even because she was difficult to work with , that would be unethical . But a jury is going to have to decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient 's life is not in jeopardy , the ethical ground rules become more blurred . But to the patient who is  | turned away , the experience can be just as devastating . Jill Gendelman , a 38-year-old vocational counselor from Bethesda , Md. , was an active young woman who swam and danced regularly before injuring her back in a fall down a flight of stairs in 1975 . Then crushing pain became her constant companion , and for the next six years she searched futilely for a doctor who would take her complaints seriously . " Doctor after doctor ? orthopedic surgeons , neurosurgeons , neurologists ? threw up their hands and said , There 's nothing wrong with you , ' " recalls Jill . " They told me to go home . " Finally , however , Jill underwent an exhaustive battery of tests at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore , and doctors there determined that her physical complaints were both real and serious . " They stayed with the case long enough to find out what was going on , " says Jill . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? her pain eased at least enough for her to return to work . " These patients often are n't taken seriously , " points out Dr. Laura S. Hitchcock , a psychologist and president of the National Chronic Pain Outreach Association , " in part because of medicine 's limited knowledge about pain . " Of course , some patients are true hypochondriacs . They collect diseases , each more ominous than the previous one . A headache is a " sure sign " of a brain tumor . A twinge in the chest means a certain heart attack . Their lives are tormented by their imaginations . And listening to their Pandora 's box of problems , doctors often grow contemptuous , calling such patients " crocks , " " thick-file cases , " " turkeys , " or " GOMERS " ( " Get Out of My Emergency Room " ) . Some doctors ca n't rid themselves of such patients fast enough ? and in the process may also push out those with real problems . One young woman , whose physician was unable to find any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " see a psychiatrist . " Finally , another doctor uncovered a severe viral infection . When physicians refuse to treat particular patients , sometimes their insensitivity is particularly glaring . But in other cases , they have the interests of their patients at heart . Dr. John J. Cannell , who practiced family medicine in Beaver , a southern West Virginia town not far from much of the nation 's tobacco farming , decided not to accept new patients who smoked . And to make sure the townspeople knew he was serious , he ran an advertisement in the  | local newspaper proclaiming : " Prospective patients who smoke should look elsewhere for medical care . " " I just saw so much hypocrisy , " he says . " Nancy Reagan was saying , Say no to drugs , ' and at the same time , Ronald Reagan was signing a bill that subsidized the growing of tobacco . Tobacco kills more people in three days than cocaine kills in a year . " The death of a patient in her forties led Dr. Cristina Babiak of Venice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands out a brochure to patients that reads : " If you have not stopped smoking within three months of your first visit , you are encouraged to find another doctor who enjoys caring for dying people . " Other doctors have declined care for overweight patients . At age 21 , Nancy Summer consulted a doctor for sinus headaches . " He took one look at me , and said , You go home and lose weight , and when you do , come back , ' " she recalls . Even though all sorts of medical problems can be the result of obesity , does a physician have the right to refuse to treat a woman simply because she is overweight ? Doctors also often refuse to continue caring for patients when there is a strong disagreement over treatment . Sylvia Alton of Lake Zurich , Ill. , once described her pediatrician as " almost my best friend . " He had been caring for her six daughters since 1983 , but their relationship began to unravel in February 1988 after Sylvia 's eight-month-old daughter , Leea , received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours Leea was in an ambulance , on her way to a hospital emergency room , fighting for her life . She had trouble breathing and experienced a succession of grand mal seizures that continued for more than 11 hours . Leea still has seizures periodically and until she turned two in June 1989 , wore a protective helmet to guard against head injuries . Her pediatrician , doubtful that the seizures were caused by the DPT vaccine , recommended continuing with the series , but Sylvia refused . She also decided to take Leea to the Mayo Clinic for an evaluation , but when she asked her pediatrician for her daughter 's medical records , he reacted angrily , telling her to get out of his office and to look for a new doctor . " He assumed we were going to sue him , " recalls Sylvia . Sylvia has no plans to sue her former pediatrician . But unfortunately , the increasing incidence of medical malpractice suits has driven a wedge of suspicion between many doctors and patients . " It 's gotten to the point where in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " laments Dr. Daniel H. Johnson , Jr. , vice-speaker of the AMA 's House of Delegates . " Even so , the physician 's obligation is to deliver the best care possible ? without respect to professional liability . " Nevertheless , the Watson Clinic in Lakeland , Fla. , has a strict policy of refusing treatment to patients ( and their families ) who have filed malpractice suits against any of its 120 doctors . Since the late 1960s , when this policy was instituted , more than 20 families have been told to seek medical care elsewhere . Prominent malpractice attorneys like Miami lawyer J.B. Spence have become accustomed to having physicians ' doors slammed in their faces . His wife and daughter have been refused care by their gynecologist . And when his son was taken to an emergency room with a dislocated knee ( he had injured it in a football game ) , the orthopedist on duty would n't treat him once he was identified as Spence 's son . " But other than wounded feelings , we have n't suffered any harm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ga. , has had a more difficult time . All six **26;1165;TOOLONG in her city refuse to treat any lawyers , as well as their families and employees , who have sued OB/GYNs . And she had sued two of them for clients . In 1986 when Amanda was pregnant with her third child , she had to commute 75 miles to Savannah for prenatal care and to deliver her baby . While Amanda concedes that " any doctor who has a fear of treating me is not a doctor I want to see , " she was terribly upset when her law clerk , Sheryl Jolly , was also denied care in Brunswick . " My law clerk had no financial interest in my practice , " complains Amanda . Sheryl 's story is particularly striking . She went into premature labor during her sixth month , but when she rushed to a Brunswick hospital emergency room , she was referred instead to Savannah . She made the 75-mile trip by ambulance , but her premature baby died shortly after reaching the hospital . Although some doctors do decline to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients continue to work together , with one or the other covertly undermining their relationship . " The patient may continue to see the doctor , " says Dr. Mack Lipkin , Jr. , director of primary care at New York University Medical Center , " but not do what he or she recommends . Or the doctor may not return the patient 's phone calls or call back less quickly . " Both parties would be better off , he says , if they were honest about how they were getting along . If your own doctor 's approach to treatment does n't suit you , do n't be afraid to look for another physician , advises Dr. Lipkin . If he or she makes you feel angry or ashamed ? and you ca n't resolve this through discussion ? you might be better off with a new physician . In the same way , when a doctor finds a patient so trying treatment is being interfered with , it might be time for the relationship to end . As the AMA 's Dr. Johnson says , " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in your care ? for whatever reason . "
