In the future , however , Houston may have to share the title with Colorado Springs . This city of 350 , 000 at the base of Pikes Peak is emerging as the focal point of the US military ' s growing space effort. // Last September , President Reagan announced creation of the United States Space Command , and named this city as its headquarters . The command coordinates the space operations , such as satellite communications , weather forecasting , navigation , and attack warning , of all the military branches. // // The city was the logical site for the new unified command , since it already serves as home to the Air Force Space Command and the Consolidated Space Operations Center , or ' ' CSOC , ' ' a billion-dollar space communications center being built east of the city . In addition to uniting the military ' s satellite operations , CSOC will include a shuttle operations and planning complex. // The US Space Command is also charged with developing the military ' s consensus on the country ' s ballistic missile defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring additional billions in economic activity to Colorado Springs , as research intensifies on President Reagan ' s Strategic Defense Initiative ( SDI ) . // Some cities might have balked at such an infusion of military activity , especially when it is concentrated in an area as controversial as military space development . But Colorado Springs , which already depends directly or indirectly on the military for more than one-third of its jobs , and which is home to more than its share of retired military brass , appears to be embracing the new activity with enthusiasm. // ' ' SDI may be controversial , but it ' s not very controversial here in Colorado Springs , ' ' says James Tracey , dean of the College of Engineering and Applied Science at the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs . Adds Alfred Uhalt , manager of Rockwell International ' s office here , ' ' You don ' t hear much quarrel when they call Colorado Springs the military space capital of the world. ' ' // The city is in the running for the SDI national test facility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in space , and that will constitute the largest programming effort ever attempted . It would mean 1 , 500 to 2 , 000 jobs , estimates James Devine , the director of the city ' s economic development council. // Rockwell ' s office , a marketing operation for the company ' s space transportation systems division , opened here along with dozens of other defense contractors shortly after the Air Force Space Command was created in 1983 . Since then , and even as Colorado ' s high-tech industry on the whole has stagnated , the defense-related high-tech industries of Colorado Springs have boomed. // ' ' The Springs is the one bright spot in Colorado ' s economy right now , ' ' says Barry Poulson , chairman of the economics department at the University of Colorado at Boulder . ' ' That ' s pretty much the result of the military and space development. ' ' // Growth of the aerospace-related private sector should continue as the Space Command expands to fulfill its responsibilities. // ' ' About 38 percent of the command ' s operations will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Forster , Space Command director of public affairs . ' ' And given its missions , it will obviously be a heavy consumer of software and hardware. ' ' // This month Texas Instruments , which recently closed some of its consumer-products operations in Texas , announced plans for a 133-acre engineering complex to expand its military electronics operations here. // There is some concern that Colorado Springs could be setting itself up for future economic hardship by placing too many eggs in the military basket . But many people here voice a conviction that the military undoubtedly is in space to stay . They also observe that any decision to scuttle SDI will come only after substantial research investment. // Local observers have pinpointed a dearth of higher education opportunities and research facilities as one weakness that could curtail Colorado Springs ' s potential for space-related development . But according to educator Tracey , the city is beginning to meet that shortfall. // His school is located in a new building with ' ' absolutely state-of-the-art laboratories , ' ' he says . The school focuses on four specializations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space systems engineering. // ' ' Those are the areas we wanted to concentrate on , ' ' says Mr. Tracey , ' ' because those are the areas related to future development in Colorado Springs . ' ' Already offering master ' s level programs , the school now awaits the state higher education board ' s approval of doctoral programs . Tracey says he wants to foster the kind of public-private partnerships that gave high-tech development its start in Boston and California ' s Silicon Valley. // The city is also home to the US Space Foundation , formed in 1983 to encourage awareness of space opportunities and to involve the public and private sectors in a national dialogue on space. // Space-related public-private partnerships in Colorade Springs could receive a boost if High Frontier , a Washington-based organization promoting military and commercial applications of space , chooses the city as the site for its ' ' international space academy . ' ' Retired Army Gen. Daniel Graham , director of High Frontier and one of SDI ' s principal advocates , has proposed the academy as a graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roop Mohunlall , project director for the proposed academy , Colorado Springs is a ' ' high priority ' ' on the site selection list in part because of the space-related military operations and private companies already in place , but also because of the city ' s ' ' pro-growth , pro-military attitudes. ' ' // For all these developments , most observers here believe Houston has little to worry about . ' ' Space development isn ' t going to happen in just one place , ' ' Mr. Uhalt says , ' ' so you ' ll see a synergism where the two cities will help each other. ' ' // //
