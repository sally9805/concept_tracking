Forget the Official Secrets Act . All that the Brits are going to catch with that one is a few harmless former spies eking out their pensions with ripping yarns about the bad old days in MI5 . No , what they need over there is an Unofficial Secrets Act  --  something that will stop the English underclass from converting squalid youthful memories into rude , shrewd , occasionally lewd movies of the kind that have lately been jostling away at one another  --  and at our innocent colonial funny bones . As a group they form a kind of Disasterpiece Theater , more blithely brutal than typically British , and likely to prove ruinous to the national image , not to mention the tourist trade . <P> Even the most mild mannered of these new movies , Withnail and I , is a shock to our expectations . American literati are , after all , conditioned to share the Lake poets ' faith in the restorative powers of the pastoral : the thatch tight on the cottage roof , the peat glowing on the grate , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is especially poignant if you are as deeply down as was the " and I " of the title ( played by Paul McGann ) and as angrily out as his roommate Withnail ( Richard E. Grant ) when they were aspiring actors in London two decades ago . <P> They fear that creatures unknown to science are gestating in the sink of their slum flat . They know their agents can give them just as short shrift by long distance . Perhaps a country visit will rescue their faith in the universe 's orderliness . Well , they have reckoned without the rain , mud and chill . Or the bull in a neighbor 's field . Or the queenly ardor of Withnail 's Uncle Monty ( a sweetly mad Richard Griffiths ) , who turns up to pursue his hopeless passion for " and I. " Somehow , Wordsworth failed to mention these inconveniences . <P> Ambitious Withnail sees them as portents . If he can not realize the simple dream of a healthful week in the country , what chance does he have of becoming the next Olivier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get a job in provincial rep . Thus he begins that patient paddle up life 's stream , in the course of which he will come to accept this experience for what it was  --  a &; youthful funk , to be recouped through laughter , not a great existential turning to be brooded on . <P> Acceptance ! This is the preferred English path these days . What is missing in the new English sensibility , but not deeply missed , is a sentimentalized view of the misfortunate and the class animus that have energized English movies of the past 40 years . The new radicalism is psychological , not political , and it is often expressed as cheeky self-sufficiency . <P> No one expresses cheek more winsomely than the remarkable Emily Lloyd , 16 , who plays Lynda , the teenage heroine of Writer-Director David Leland 's Wish You Were Here ! In the course of writing the film Personal Services  --  a raffishly surreal account of Cynthia Payne 's career as a divinely unhypocritical London madam that illuminated American screens early this year  --  Leland learned enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a marvelously uncluttered tale it is.
