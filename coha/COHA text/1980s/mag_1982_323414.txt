HANKY PANKY <P> Directed by Sidney Poitier <P> Screenplay by Henry Rosenbaum and David Taylor <P> The police are after him , suspecting him of murder . Some renegade CIA agents are also in nasty pursuit , convinced he helped repossess some missile plans that they went to a lot of trouble to steal from the Government . No question about it , mild-mannered Architect Michael Jordan ( Gene Wilder ) has to run for cover . But when he packs his bag , he pauses to match up his socks and then roll them up into prim little balls , just the way his mother taught him . <P> It is a funny , human moment , and if Hanky Panky had 30 or 40 more of them it might have been a congenial little picture . It certainly would have been better if Gilda Radner had not decided that for her next impersonation she would do a romantic ingnue . She is , in lantern-jaw looks and brash spirit , unsuited to playing such a role straight and apparently unwilling to parody it . Wilder seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acting for both of them , with results that strain his normally funny interpretation of the coward who finds , if not grace , then shrewdness , under pressure . <P> In fairness to the performers , it must be said they get no help from writers who lost their sense of humor in their labyrinthine plot . The story is illogical and is without the kind of inventive startlements that make logic irrelevant to pleasure . Director Sidney Poitier is always cutting to some chase or other , all of which he handles with glum professionalism . But it is disheartening that a star team with the potential brilliance of Wilder and Radner had to take off on such an ungainly turkey . - R.S.
