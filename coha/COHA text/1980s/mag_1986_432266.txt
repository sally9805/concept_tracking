I will never forget that beautiful August afternoon seven years ago . I 'd spent the morning giving our apartment a thorough cleaning , and I had prepared the beef and vegetables for a stir-fried dinner . I felt satisfied with the day 's accomplishments and was now looking forward to relaxing with a good book and a tall glass of iced tea . In the next room , my four-week-old son Jason was sleeping soundly . Everything felt very peaceful . Suddenly I heard slow footsteps coming up the stairs to our second-floor apartment . Could that be my husband , Kevin ? I wondered . And if so , why was he coming home from work so early ? Kevin worked in a chemical plant and also attended college at night to complete his degree in chemistry . I heard a key turn in the lock ; then the door opened and Kevin staggered into the apartment and fell onto the sofa . " Kevin , what 's wrong ? " I cried in alarm . " I felt sick at work , so I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing his eyes . " Then , as I was driving home , I began having bad chest pains . " I stared at him in disbelief . Older people , people with heart trouble , had chest pains . This could n't be happening to my healthy 23-year-old husband . Kevin lay back on the sofa with his eyes closed , breathing heavily . He was deathly pale . Then I noticed a faint but unmistakable bluish cast beginning to spread over his face . I looked down at his hands . They were even bluer . " Kevin , you 're turning blue ! " I exclaimed . " Were you handling a chemical that could have made you sick ? " " I was working with parabromo aniline , " he answered . " A hose burst and some of it spilled on my arms . But I think I washed it all off . " Kevin 's words did n't reassure me : they terrified me . What kind of chemical was para-bromo aniline ? " I 'm calling the company , " I announced . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , no , do n't do that , " he protested weakly . " I 'll be all right . I just need to rest .... " I was n't even listening . Something was making Kevin sick , of that I was sure , and I had to try and find out what it was . So I picked up the telephone and dialed the number of the chemical company where Kevin worked . I 'm still not sure why I felt it was so important that I control my panic enough to make that phone call right away , but my decision to do so was crucial to my husband 's chance for surviving this ordeal . My voice shook as I told the receptionist that I thought Kevin had been poisoned by parabromo aniline . She asked me to hold on , and , after an eternity , Kevin 's supervisor came on the line . I explained to him that Kevin was very sick , and I thought we should go to the hospital right away . He put me on hold yet again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | the chemical company came on the line . " We 're trying to locate a company doctor we have on call , " he said in a voice that sounded as alarmed as I felt . " He 's a specialist in industrial medicine .... " The president 's voice trailed off ; then he announced the doctor had been found . He told me to take Kevin to the emergency room of a nearby hospital , where the company specialist would be waiting for us . I thought I 'd have to bully Kevin into going to the hospital , but by this time he was so ill he needed no convincing . He was still sitting on the sofa , struggling to tie his shoes . Then , before I could stop him , he stood up and staggered toward the stairs . This was the next obstacle ? the long . straight flight of stairs that led from our apartment to the outside door on the ground floor . How would I ever be able to get my 180-pound husband down those stairs and into the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Grasping his arm , I said , " Sit down on the top step . I 'm going to call an ambulance . " But Kevin did n't seem to hear me . He took a few slow steps forward , almost as if he were sleepwalking , then he staggered and began to fall backward . Quickly I caught him under the arms and lowered him to a sitting position on the top step . By now he was completely limp , so I " bumped " him down the stairs . step by step . By the time we reached the bottom of the stairs . Kevin was almost unconscious . I eased him to the floor and raced back upstairs to call an ambulance . I also phoned Kevin 's and my parents , but no one was home . I did reach my sister , Peggy , who said she 'd come right over . Then I looked down at my arms . Suppose the substance that had made Kevin sick had gotten on me ? I went into the bathroom and scrubbed my hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked in on Jason . He was still sleeping soundly , and tears came to my eyes as I thought of the possibility of his losing his father before he had even known him . I ran back down the stairs to check on Kevin . He had regained consciousness , but he looked terrible . He was sitting on the bottom step , trembling and twitching , and he had a silly smile on his face ? almost as if he were drunk . More frightened than ever , I stepped carefully around him and opened the front door so that the paramedics would be sure to see him the moment they arrived . Then I raced back upstairs to get Jason , grabbed the diaper bag and a few diapers , and hurried back down the stairs to wait for the ambulance .  | To my relief , the paramedics arrived right away . After I explained what had happened , they put Kevin on a stretcher and carried him out to the ambulance . Then they radioed the hospital where the company doctor was waiting , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connected him to a heart monitor . Peggy arrived just as the ambulance was about to leave and she took Jason in her car . I got into the ambulance and Peggy followed us to the hospital . The minute we arrived at the emergency room , a team of doctors and nurses rushed out to meet us . Kevin was still conscious as they wheeled him off to an examining room . Peggy sat with Jason in the waiting room as I tried once again , unsuccessfully , to call Kevin 's and my parents . The emergency room was a flurry of activity as doctors and nurses hurried through the halls with their arms full of medical textbooks . A nurse told me that they were searching for an antidote to para-bromo aniline . I could only pray that they would find one in time . While we were sitting in the waiting room , Jason began to cry . It had been a long time since his last feeding , and I was sure he was hungry . A thoughtful nurse let us go into an empty office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason kept my mind occupied as we waited for some word on Kevin 's condition . Though I tried to find out if the medical staff had located an antidote to para-bromo aniline , no one seemed to know anything . Peggy did her best to cheer me up , but I felt terribly helpless not knowing whether Kevin was going to live or die . After an hour 's agonizing wait , a nurse came out and told me I could see Kevin . I rushed across the hall to where he lay in the treatment room . Kevin 's eyes were half shut and he was very pale . Taking his hand , I whispered , " How do you feel ? " " Sick , " he answered weakly . But I 'm going to be okay . " I was so relieved to hear his voice that I burst into tears . It was then I was told of the drama that had taken place during the last hour . Kevin had lost consciousness in the treatment room , as the doctors and nurses had frantically searched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fortunately , they found one just in time ? a drug called methylene blue . When Kevin had responded to it , the entire staff broke into applause . The industrial specialist explained to me how Kevin had been accidentally poisoned . Para-bromo aniline , he told me , is a highly toxic substance used in the manufacture of solvents and dyes . Even though Kevin had immediately washed the chemical from his skin when the hose burst , he had n't realized that some had seeped into the rubber gloves he was wearing , where it pooled at his fingertips . The delicate skin under his fingernails had absorbed the liquid and the toxin entered his bloodstream . This made the blood 's hemoglobin unable to release oxygen to the tissues , resulting in cyanosis , which is the medical term for the blue appearance of Kevin 's skin . Fortunately , the antidote had been found just in time ? and administered before the toxin had caused brain damage , and , ultimately , death . Weak with relief , I tried once again to call Kevin 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach them , and I explained what had happened . They rushed right over to the hospital , but by this time Kevin was sleeping , so they took Jason and me home . Four days later Kevin came home from the hospital feeling almost like his old self . However , this was not quite the end of our ordeal . Because Kevin 's liver had been involved in removing the toxin from his body , he needed monthly blood tests for the next year to be sure his liver was functioning properly . And at the end of the year , he had to undergo a liver biopsy . Fortunately , the biopsy results were normal , and his doctors pronounced Kevin completely cured . This all happened seven years ago , and our lives have changed considerably since then . Jason is now a lively seven year old , and we have another son , Andrew , who is two . Kevin no longer works with chemicals ; shortly after the accident he found a new job and changed his course of study at school . He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must admit I 'm relieved he chose a new career . I learned an important lesson from our near-disaster. 1 now know that I can cope with an emergency ? and I keep the number for the paramedic unit posted near the telephone at all times . Although the fear I felt during that August afternoon has faded , the memories have not . But I 'm not bitter about what happened to Kevin just thankful that he 's strong and healthy once again .
