Du Pont Co. said its sprawling plant at La Porte , Texas , would begin producing methyl isocyanate , the chemical that killed more than 2 , 000 in a gas leak at Union Carbide Corp. ' s plant in Bhopal , India . Du Pont said it would use a new pesticide manufacturing process in making the chemical at La Porte , about 20 miles from downtown Houston . The plant is in a heavily congested area where many petrochemical facilities and refineries are located . Union Carbide , which was the sole U.S. manufacturer of methyl isocyanate , has suspended production of the chemical until it completes an investigation of the Bhopal tragedy . Du Pont was unable to continue making its highly profitable Lannate pesticide without methyl isocyanate , a main ingredient . The Wilmington , Del. - based company also has interests in plastics , fibers and energy . Instead of making methyl isocyanate at one location and shipping it to another for refining , Du Pont will produce methyl isocyanate at the La Porte plant in a " closed-loop " system that will use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pesticide , plant officials said . " There ' s no question that we definitely want to preserve the end product , " said R.D. Stewart , manager of the plant . Although Union Carbide eventually may resume supplying Du Pont with methyl isocyanate , " We just weren ' t sure how long that was going to take , " he said . Du Pont has studied making its own methyl isocyanate since as early as 1977 and even took steps to develop such a closed-loop system , Mr. Stewart said . But Lannate was profitable enough that Du Pont could afford to buy methyl isocyanate and have it shipped to La Porte by railroad tanker car from Union Carbide ' s plant in Institute , W.Va . , Mr. Stewart said . Union Carbide suspended production at the Institute plant after the gas leak in Bhopal . The Du Pont closed-loop installation will cost between $10 million and $11 million and is expected to be completed by June 1 . The project requires a permit from the Texas Air Control Board , but Mr. Stewart said he doesn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety significance of what we ' re trying to do , " Mr. Stewart said . " We would be very excited to approve a permit like this , " said Sam Crowther , chemicals section chief in the agency ' s permits division . Mr. Crowther is handling Du Pont ' s application for the closed-loop system . Instead of unloading tank cars and maintaining two huge , above-ground storage tanks of methyl isocyanate , Du Pont " will whip it through a pipe and consume it practically the instant it ' s made . At any one time , there will only be a few pounds ( of methyl isocyanate ) in the system , " Mr. Crowther said . Du Pont typically has maintained an inventory at La Porte of 30 , 000 gallons of methyl isocyanate , which was delivered monthly . Du Pont also makes a variety of other chemicals at the La Porte plant , which is along a ship channel . Separately , Nor-Am Chemical Co. , a unit of Schering AG of West Germany , said it suspended production of an insecticide because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Nor-Am vice president , said the Muskegon , Mich. - based company is continuing to make the other two chemical ingredients of the insecticide , the plant ' s only finished product . He said 10 of the plant ' s 50 employees were laid off Jan. 1 . He also said Nor-Am is considering making methyl isocyanate itself or trying substitute chemicals .
