Although drug smugglers quickly circumvented the Reagan Administration ' s first crackdown in southern Florida , the new chief of federalcriminal enforcement says federal drug agents will not be outflanked again . " It ' s a constant cat-and-mouse game , " said Stephen S. Trott , newly installed as the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department ' s criminal division . " I ' m absolutely convinced the crooks watch the enforcment efforts and try to figure out ways to get around us , " Trott said in an interview Friday . " They ' re a lot more sophisticated than people think so it ' s up to us to continually put up a front that says , No matter where you go , here we are . ' " The Reagan Administration took office facing a smuggling crisis that had left southern Florida awash in drugs , particularly cocaine and marijuana from Latin America , and illegal drug money . The drug gangs conducted wars with automatic weapons on Miami ' s streets . A federal task force centered in Miami and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigations , but the drug smugglers began diverting shipments to formerly untouched areas like rural Georgia and Tennessee . Federal officials quickly found that rural sheriffs were being offered more than than their annual salaries to look the other way as drug smuggling planes landed on isolated , makeshift airstrips . As a result , the Administration got approval from Congress to expand itsdrug task forces to cover the entire nation , and Bush was put in charge of a national narcotics border interdiction system , with increased aid from military radar planes . The first year ended with federal Drug Enforcement Administration figures showing the street prices of cocaine , marijuana and heroin dropping and the purity rising slightly , an indication that supplies were actually up slightly . The DEA head , Francis Mullen , acknowledged the first year was a draw . But now , Trott , whose first Reagan Administration job , from 1981 to last July , was as US attorney in Los Angeles , feels all the elements are in place to prevent another outflanking maneuver by the smugglers . " We ' re bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surround the country with them , " Trott said , noting that committees of federal , state and local law-enforcement officers in every region have made drug control their No. 1 priority . With Coast Guard cutters stationed in the major smuggling straits in the Caribbean and sophisticated military AWACS planes providing radar surveillance in the Gulf of Mexico , DEA intelligence officers think that the smugglers may try to shift their sea routes from Colombia , the final processing point for most cocaine and marijuana , to the Pacific and the US West Coast . If that happens , Trott , 43 , who spent 16 years in the Los Angeles district attorney ' s office before becoming a federal prosecutor , thinks the federal government is ready . He notes that a border interdiction office was set up in June in Long Beach , Calif. , with staff from all the affected federal agencies , the Los Angeles Police Department and local sheriffs . " They work with the Coast Guard and they have the military resources at their disposal . They ' re trying to deploy the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I think they ' re pretty well prepared for that type of assault up and down the West Coast . " Trott acknowledges that drug supplies are up , but attributes it to increased supplies , stemming in part of a decision by the drug rings to begin cultivating coca in Colombia in addition to the traditional growing areas in Bolivia and Peru . " The producers simply have been putting this stuff in place at a rate that is staggering , " Trott said in the interview . " But we ' re making tremendous inroads . " " I ' d be a lot happier if we saw less stuff out on the streets , " he said . " But I don ' t think the fact that in some areas we see more is any indication whatsoever that we ' re either on the wrong track or we haven ' t been producing . " " We ' re using new ways of getting at this . We ' re not just following the dope anymore , " Trott said . " Years back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' d miss the brains of the operations , the financiers , the kingpins , the people who don ' t get their hands dirty with dope . Now , we ' re following the money as well as the dope . "
