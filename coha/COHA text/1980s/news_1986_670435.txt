And it was almost like any other large international scientific congress , with lectures and workshops and participants chatting in corridors . The difference was that at the opening session of the Delta Society ' s meeting at the Boston Park Plaza Hotel , a wire fox terrier was in the front row . A Labrador retriever put his paws on the lobby reception counter and accepted his mistress ' s room key in his mouth . And people rushing down the hall to yet another workshop were often in wheelchairs , with a dog trotting briskly alongside. // The theme of the three-day conference , which ended today , was " Living Together : People , Animals and the Environment . " It drew participants from 18 countries - and dozens of dogs . The Delta Society , which has its offices in Renton , Wash. , was founded in 1976 as an international research resource and clearinghouse for information on the interaction of humans , animals and the environment - an interaction symbolized by the three sides of the triangle that forms the Greek letter delta. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting represented organizations that train assistance animals , as they are known. // Papers on the scientific and philosophical aspects of man ' s relationship to animals and nature ranged from " Christian Theology and Rights of Animals " to " Feline Aggression Against People . " Studies on how animals may affect cardiovascular function were reported on , a follow-up to the widely publicized findings released in 1980 that stroking an animal causes a lowering of blood pressure in some people . " It ' s gratifying that there are now five or six confirming studies , " said Dr. Aaron Katcher , an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of its Center for the Interaction of Animals and Society . " But my concern is that it should not be overextended as a generalization . It ' s not something one would use to cure hypertension , although it might be helpful in preventing somebody ' s blood pressure from going up . Stroking animals may also increase the secretion of endorphins in people . This is speculation . I hope we ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Endorphins are substances released in the brain that act as natural tranquilizers. // " But nurturing per se is physiologically as well as psychologically rewarding , " Dr. Katcher said , " and animals permit us to engage in nurturing over and above the opportunities offered by the availability of human children. " // As for the nurturing going on at the conference , it was sometimes difficult to judge who was doing it : the humans or the assistance dogs that were making it possible for many to participate. // Dogs wore backpacks that contained their owner ' s needs for the day , pulled wheelchairs , turned on light switches , pushed elevator buttons , picked up dropped items and dozed patiently while their owners made presentations . One had to be careful not to step on a paw in many a conference room aisle. // A new and growing dimension to the animal-human bond , the role pets can play in psychotherapy , was among the topics explored . Dr. Carol Antoinette Peacock , a psychotherapist at the Northeastern Family Institute in Danvers , Mass. , said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poppy , as a " partner and tool in a standard psychotherapeutic hour , " particularly with teen-agers. // Dr. Peacock showed a videotape of herself and Liz , a 14-year-old patient who had suffered from a developmental disorder since her older brother forced her to have intercourse at an early age . Dr. Peacock took Liz gently through the family history while the girl brushed the dog . As the subject of abuse was approached , Liz brushed more purposefully . " It started happening when I was 7 , " she said , and then stopped brushing and just stroked the dog. // " Poppy is a bridge , a conversational link , " Dr. Peacock said . " The dog doesn ' t promote healing but draws the adolescent into the human process of therapy with the possibility of human growth and change. " // The pervasive conference theme was how animals help the elderly and people with disabilities . The star was Abdul , a Laborador retriever who has spent nearly all of his 10 years with Kerrill Knaus , a 30-year-old quadriplegic who travels in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Independence of Santa Rosa , Calif. , at the conference. // Later Miss Knaus discussed how assistance dogs work with young children with severe disabilities . She told of Brice Pruyn , a 5-year-old boy , completely deaf from infancy , and explained how a dog can help such a child " see " sounds : " A plane passes over the house . The dog looks up , so the boy looks up and sees the plane. // He doesn ' t know what it is , so he signs to his mother , ' What is it ? ' and his mother signs back the word for plane. " // The role of a dog in helping a deaf master was further demonstrated by Ellen Terryberry of the Red Acre Farm Hearing Dog Center , with the cooperation of Rainbow , a 7-year-old papillon . When a smoke alarm went off , the dog dropped to the floor at Ms. Terryberry ' s feet , a predetermined signal. // Participants often alluded to the importance of training and screening both dog and owner . For work with autistic children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You pick a dog who is very stable and outgoing , " said Carolyn McCollam , a trainer who represented Handi-Dogs of West Virginia , which trains dogs for people with mental and emotional disabilities. // " The dog spends all the time with that kid and is persistent in soliciting the kid ' s attention . And finally the kid begins to notice the dog . To look at it. // And after a while to touch it . And sometimes within a few weeks to play with it , rolling on the floor and giggling. " // Although the only animals participating in the conference were dogs , the bonds that can develop between pet owners and fish , birds and cats were illustrated by a report on a program at the Lorton ( Va . ) Reformatory near Washington . According to Dr. Earl Strimpel , the veterinarian involved , taking responsibility for an animal improves the attitudes of longtime inmates . As an offshoot , three months ago the program began to train selected inmates for jobs as animal caretakers when they are released . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Strimpel said. // The ethical and moral questions raised by animal experimentation and factory farming were raised in various contexts , as was educating children about animals . In a session on " Animals and Children " Dr. Alan Bowd of Lakehead University in Ontario , said : " Humane education has taught children to be kind to individual animals . We should also be teaching children their responsibility to animals generally. " //
