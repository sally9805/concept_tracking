LOS ANGELES  --  Hilton Hotels Corp. , in a step to help ward off a possible takeover bid by Golden Nugget Inc. , raised its bank credit line to $600 million from $250 million . Separately , Hilton will ask shareholders to approve a number of anti-takeover provisions at its annual meeting May 6 . In proxy materials , Hilton made only brief mention of Golden Nugget ' s recent $72-a-share offer for the 24. 7% of the company ' s common stock outstanding owned by the Conrad N. Hilton estate . The company said the increased credit line was partly in response to the Golden Nugget offer , which could be a first step to buying Hilton , but the anti-takeover provisions weren ' t . The hotel and gambling concern also said its chairman and president , Barron Hilton , won tentative backing from the Internal Revenue Service for his claim to the 6. 8 million Hilton shares owned by the estate of his late father , who founded the company . Mr. Hilton , in a statement , said the IRS ruling " adds further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shares . Howard Friedman , an attorney representing the Conrad N. Hilton Foundation , which also has laid claim to the shares , said that should the IRS ultimately back Mr. Hilton , there are a " whole host of other issues " before the court that would have to be decided before Mr. Hilton could be awarded the shares . " Even if the IRS agrees with Mr. Hilton , our lawsuit would still be very much alive , " Mr. Friedman said . As previously reported , Golden Nugget last week offered to buy the Hilton estate shares at $72 each , or $488 million , and indicated it will consider making a similar offer to all Hilton shareholders . Barron Hilton , who exercised an option to purchase the shares at $24. 20 each shortly after his father ' s death in 1979 , has called the offer inadequate . James E. Bates , executor of the Hilton estate and a Hilton director , also termed the offer inadequate and said it is unclear whether he has the power to sell the stock . In composite trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed at $70. 50 , down 75 cents . Stephen A. Wynn , Golden Nugget chairman and president , labeled Mr. Hilton ' s statement and the company ' s decision to increase its credit lines " an attempt to scare me . But his statement didn ' t convince me of anything . " Mr. Wynn , who likes to boast that executives of his hotel and gambling concern are top-flight gamblers , acknowledged in an interview that his flamboyant style and public image cause some people to underestimate his business acumen . " Every day of my life isn ' t Saturday night , " he said . Mr. Wynn said he plans to push ahead with his offer and added that he and Mr. Bates have agreed to talk again today . Mr. Bates couldn ' t be reached for comment . Among the anti-takeover provisions in Hilton ' s proxy are : increasing the number of authorized common shares to 90 million from 60 million ; authorizing an issue of 10 million shares of preferred stock ; staggering the election of directors to require at least two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board ; outlawing certain holder actions without a shareholder meeting ; and requiring at least 75% shareholder approval rather than a simple majority for certain actions . The amendments also seek to guarantee shareholders uniform treatment in the event of a takeover . The company said it doesn ' t have any current plans to issue additional shares . It has 24. 7 million common shares outstanding . Hilton , which last month was denied a license to operate its Atlantic City hotel-casino , also is asking holders to approve a measure requiring holders who refuse to appear before gambling authorities or who are found not qualified to own stock by those authorities to sell their holdings . New Jersey gambling authorities have granted Hilton a rehearing on its application for a license . Hilton also reported that first-quarter earnings rose 22% to $23. 5 million , or 94 cents a share , from $19. 1 million , or 71 cents a share , a year earlier . Revenue rose to $168. 2 million from $164 million . Pre-tax profit from gambling operations rose 19% from a year earlier , Hilton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the company said . Per-share earnings for the first quarter were based on 24. 9 million shares , about two million fewer than a year ago because of stock repurchases in 1984 .
