THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment IT has been almost three and a half years now since the workers in the Lenin Shipyards in Gdansk , Po-land , launched their remarkable seventeen-day strike , during which a committee of suddenly transformed labor leaders forced an astonished government commission into face-to-face negotiations . These were broadcast live over the shipyards ' P.A. system , so that every striker could listen in , and a film crew from Warsaw captured each moment , so that within a few months every single Pole could relive the experience , over and over again , in daily screenings of the entire negotiations . There were several vivid moments : Lech Walesa challenging the embarrassed Deputy Prime Minister Mieczyslaw Jagielski on the question of the very existence of political prisoners , with the workers outside chanting their support of Walesa 's position and their derision of the government 's ; a shipyard nurse , Alina Pienkowska , meekly detailing the horrible working conditions in the yards ; the government negotiators trying to entice the workers ' presidium back to Warsaw for final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he was . But perhaps the most memorable moment  --  or , at any rate , the one that audiences at the documentary 's screenings throughout Poland during 1981 seemed to savor the most occurred when Andrzej Gwiazda , a craggy-faced man who was Lech Walesa 's deputy in the negotiations , stopped one of the last sessions cold with a sombre question . " We 're about to sign an agreement here with the government 's representatives , " he said bluntly to Jagielski , " but what guarantees do we have that in a year 's time the strikers and the members of this presidium wo n't be treated as common criminals ? " The audiences at the film 's screenings used to squirm in happy anticipation as the camera panned over to a flustered Jagielski . Many in the audience  --  veterans of countless earlier screenings would begin mouthing out the Deputy Prime Minister 's answer with him , miming his haughty , histrionic , righteously offended manner . ( At times like this , the movie hall could seem like a Polish version of a Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture Show . " ) " Mr. Gwiazda , " Jagielski said , blustering , " you have made an insinuation which  --  which , I must say , has disappointed me . What guarantee do we have that the strikers and the presidium wo n't be regarded as , as ... I do n't even want to repeat it . How could you say such a thing ? The word ' criminals " ? he seemed to hold the word itself out at arm 's length with disdain ? " that word offends me personally . After all , I 'm talking to the most upstanding of people . How could anybody ever treat the activists gathered here in such a manner ? " Well , of course , someone has  --  the very government that Jagielski was representing at the talks  --  and since December 13 , 1981 , Andrzej Gwiazda has been one of the thousands of " upstanding " Poles whom Warsaw 's martial-law regime has deemed fit to treat as criminals . Granted , the regime has been releasing several hundred of these prisoners in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bars , in often brutalizing conditions , and eleven of the union 's top leaders , including Gwiazda himself , are now entering their twenty-sixth month under investigative detention , awaiting trial on dubious charges of plotting the violent overthrow of the state . Gwiazda suffers from stomach ulcers and gallstones , and periodontitis as well  --  syndromes severely aggravated by the conditions of his imprisonment ; he has lost all his front teeth . He has nevertheless retained his resolute spirits and a bracing sense of humor about his predicament , as is evidenced in several letters to his family which recently found their way into an issue of the Uncensored Poland News Bulletin , a London-based , English-language biweekly newsletter . Last winter , he wrote from Warsaw 's Mokotow Prison , shortly after being transferred there from the Bialoleka internment center , " Here tea is the most sought-after and coveted item . When they searched my stuff from Bialoleka , I got the impression that a metal file or a rope ladder would have evoked less emotion among the guards than a tea bag . The walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tea . We had a kipisz  --  something like a search . When we returned from a walk , we found all our stuff turned over . The confiscation of my tobacco was a great loss . It had been made up from carefully collected dog-ends and was just halfway through the process of refinement with the help of syrup from strawberry jam and apple rinds . They said it had been thrown away because it had been ' mixed with tea . ' Do n't try to understand it  --  even I , after fourteen months of imprisonment , was struck dumb . " He also reported , " Both my mates are asleep ; they 've received permission from the doctor to remain in bed during the day . I 'm lucky myself in being relatively healthy and not needing to lie down , so I 'm not allowed to ! ... Send me some Pyralgin ( painkiller ) ; they 've only got antineuralgin here , which does n't help me at all and , further , strongly aggravates my stomach .... They X-rayed my gallstone ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't be able to see the photograph , of course , because it 's secret . The same as not knowing which medicines I 'm being given .... I am having trouble with the remaining teeth which are left me after a year of prison dental care . I am unable to eat food quickly enough in order to finish it before it gets completely cold . " In April , Gwiazda reported on brief walks he was being allowed once a day inside the prison yard  --  his only outdoor exercise . " There are snails in the walking place , " he wrote . " There used to be four , but now I 've seen only two , one of which did n't look too good . In January , I pushed a semi-rotten apple core toward them . They seemed to move in its direction , but you ca n't really tell much about a snail 's intentions  --  especially if it 's freezing cold  --  in only half an hour . " Mokotow was turning out to be " a real prison , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There is a bucket , and r , , I . 5- , ' . , I i7- ! ? ? . no toilet of any kind . Inside the cell there is a barred cage with another lock . I feel as though I were on an outing  --  fresh air , cold , few people , sleeping on a hard bed under a blanket with no sheets . The only things missing are beautiful scenery and , of course , the possibility of going on long walks . " In another letter , last March , Gwiazda recalled his days in the Army , back in the early fifties , during the Stalinist era : " The battery commander was constantly threatening me with arrest . While he was away , the noncommissioned officers took advantage of this and had me clapped inside . But when he returned the commander gave them a terrible telling off : ' Until now , Gwiazda was only afraid of being arrested , and now what have you done ? Shown him that it 's not so terrible after all . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation must exist throughout Poland now . All at once , for no reason whatever , several thousand people have passed through the mythical prison and stopped being afraid . " And , indeed , even though the re-gime of General Wojciech Jaruzelski has proved remarkably successful dur-ing the past two years in atomizing Polish socie-ty , gutting the country 's culture , and exhausting the workers ' resistance , still there are indica-tions that it is Poland 's leaders who have the most to fear . The work-ers may be exhausted , but the leaders are afraid . Nowhere is this anxiety more evident than in the regime 's of-ten bizarre handling of the case against the eleven imprisoned Soli-darity leaders . ( Actu-ally , seven of the defen-dants are former union officials , like Gwiazda , while the four others were active in KOR , the Workers Defense Com-mittee , which was a sup-port group of sym-pathetic intellectuals . ) The prosecution in this case has gathered thirty-five volumes of " evi-dence , " and hardly a month goes by when some government spokesman does n't predict the imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defendants rot in prison without a single charge being brought against them in court . One clue to the regime 's hesitancy can he found in the twelve-page Act of Indictment ( a sort of " Cliffs Notes " distillation of the thirty-five volumes ) , which as early as last fall was circulating among the defendants and their lawyers in Warsaw . In the words of one lawyer who saw it and was subsequently quoted in the Uncensored Poland N CW5 Bulletin , " it is n't clear whether the intention behind the indictment is to send these men to prison or to build a monument to them . " And Adam Michnik , one of the KOR defendants , commented in a secret interview somehow given in prison and then published in the underground journal Tygodnik Illemozvsze a few months ago , " We very much want this trial to go ahead . A trial can not compromise us , but it may compromise the regime . The documentation contained in the thirty-five volumes is a mine of information , not so much about KOR as about its present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have read here in the thirty-five volumes about ' the sad engine-drivers of the prison trains , ' as Czeslaw Milosz would have called them . Jaruzelski counts on the discipline of the judges who will be sentencing us . But he should not rely on the discipline of the accused . " Indeed , thus far not one of the eleven defendants has recanted in the slightest ; these are not the sort of subjects whom Soviet-bloc officials are accustomed to casting in their show trials . This may he one reason the leaders of the Warsaw regime have recently been offering the eleven defendants freedom in exchange for exile . But even here the defendants have proved maddeningly stubborn : not one of them has accepted the offer . " I am not interested in emigrating , " Michnik told his interviewer . " It would be more useful if they Jaruzelski and his colleagues left instead . " Last fall , Jacek Kuron , another of the KOR prisoners , developed a painful kidney condition and was rushed to , of all places , a hospital of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland . There doctors put him through numerous tests and discovered several new ailments , all of which , they told him , were extremely serious  --  so serious , in ? fact , that they could be treated only in the West . Furious at this ploy , Kuron demanded to be returned to his cell , and there he now , once again , waits . This past December , Michnik penned a scathing open letter , copies of which have just reached the West , to General Czeslaw Kiszczak , the Interior Minister . Noting that " you recently addressed a strange proposal to me : that either I spend this Christmas on the Cate d'Azur or be facing a trial and many years in prison , " Michnik wrote , " General , I well know why you need our departure from this country . So as to be able to defame us in your newspapers with redoubled ferocity as people who have finally shown their true colors , who were previously only fulfilling someone else 's orders and have now , blatantly , let themselves be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are generous liberals and we nonentities without character . To be able to tell the Poles , ' Look , even they gave ? up , even they lost their hope for a democratic and free Poland . ' For all these reasons , but most of all to improve your image ill your own eyes , so that you 'll be able to breathe a sigh of relief : ' There , they were n't any better than we are after all . ' For the very existence of people who associate Poland not with a ministry portfolio but with a prison cell , people who prefer Christmas in an investigation prison to a vacation on the Cate d'Azur , makes your lifea torment .... After all , none of you would hesitate if offered the choice . You are unable to think about us in a different way because , thinking differently , you would he forced to discover  --  if only for a moment  --  the truth about yourselves . " Michnik continued , " I can not know the future and do not know if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the lie , and of Solidarity over this present anti-worker dictatorship . But the thing is , General , that for me the value of our struggle lies not in the possibility of winning but , rather , in the value of the cause on behalf of which we launched this struggle in the first place . . .. For me , General , prison is not such a painful punishment . That December night , it was not I who got proscribed . It was freedom . And today it is not I who am imprisoned . It 's Poland . Punishment for me would be if , under your orders , I had to spy , to brandish the staff , to fire on workers , to interrogate prisoners and pronounce shameless conviction sentences . I 'm lucky that I happen to be on the right side : among the victims , and not among the victimizers . " The fact of the matter is that KOR and Solidarity were twin emanations of a remarkable nonviolent spirit , and any attempt to demonstrate the contrary will prove a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evoked in the last paragraphs of Michnik 's letter , when he made reference to the coming holiday : " This is the reason I do riot ask for anything . I want you to think for a moment , while you sit at your Christmas Eve table , that someday you will be called to account for breaking the law . Those whom you harmed and humiliated will send you the bill . It will be a very dark moment . Well , Christmas Eve is a time for toasts and wishes . My wish for you is that you will be able to keep your personal dignity at that moment . And your courage . Whatever happens , please do n't stammer , as your colleagues from former governments did , that you did n't know . Because such claims do n't arouse mercy , only contempt .. .. For myself , I wish that , just as I managed to be on the scene that afternoon in Otwock in May , 1981 when I helped save the lives of those men of yours who were surrounded by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the spot the next time , when you will be in danger , and that I 'll be able to help you , too . You see , I hope that I will always be able to be on the side of the victims , and not among the victimizers  --  even if you were to throw me right back into prison immediately afterward and still be amazed by my stupidity . " Coffey and Cahill D lANE ConrrY and Linda Cahill , a couple of modest , sensible , efficient powerhouses working for Mayor Koch whose official titles are respectively , the Mayor 's Chief of Staff and the Director of the Mayor 's Office of Special Projects and Events ( Mrs. Cahill is also one of the Mayor 's Special Assistants ) , swing into action the moment the Mayor tells them he is about to greet and/or entertain and/or feed Distinguished Guests . Barbara Margolis , whose title is Commissioner for Distinguished Guests , is , as the late Grover Whalen was , the official City Greeter . Mrs. Coffey and Mrs. Cahill do everything that must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greet , with or without the Mayor . The other weekend , when Distinguished Guest His Excellency Zhao Ziyang , Premier of the People 's Republic of China , blew into town for roughly forty-eight hours , he was greeted as he stepped off an Air Force Presidential jet at Kennedy Airport by Senator Alfonse D'Amato and Mayor Koch . ( Mrs. Margolis , as it happened , was busy elsewhere . ) Hundreds of logistical details from then on were masterminded by Mrs. Coffey and Mrs. Cahill . Mayor Koch , after shaking Premier Zhao 's hand , gave him the key to the city . Who gave Mayor Koch the key ? Mrs. Cahill . From her stockpile of keys to the city , which she keeps in a closet in her office at 52 Chambers Street , behind City Hall . ( The key , six inches long and inscribed with the seal of the city and the date of its founding , 1625 , and also with the name of Edward I. Koch , is made of lead and antimony and is supposed to be a facsimile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City Hall . Part of City Hall , including the door and , presumably , the key , burned up in a fire in 1858 . The keys handed out today are made by the L. G. Balfour Company , famous for its school rings , which makes the official ring of the National Basketball Association 's All Star Game and also the Most Valuable Player trophies for basketball and baseball . ) The key is usually given to heads of state and to certain mayors , FEBRUARY 6,1984 foreign and domestic . The Mayor decides who gets one . The above facts were provided to us by Mrs. Coffey and Mrs. Cahill , both of whom are slim , trim , and pleasantly tailored . Both live , with their husbands and children , not far from Gracie Mansion , where we met them and listened to a recap of the groundwork they laid for the Mayor 's luncheon for Premier Zhao . Plenty , we learned , went on before Mayor Koch was able to greet Premier Zhao again , in front of Gracie Mansion ; to take him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to line him up in a receiving line in the library to shake hands with seventy American guests for the luncheon ; to have Premier Zhao sit on a library sofa for a press-photographers ' - pool view of the Mayor and the Premier ; to take him through the kitchen to a basement conference room to pose for sixty representatives of the press and television and to go through the motions of exchanging gifts  --  a crystal sculpture made gratis by Tiffany and bearing the city seal , the date 1625 , and the name of Edward I. Koch , and a multicolored porcelain vase from Guangdong Province , where Premier Zhao was a Communist Party official  --  also for the benefit of the press and television ; to lead the Premier upstairs to the ballroom ; to explain to him , through an interpreter , that right after the Premier 's visit Gracie Mansion would undergo renovations , including breaking through a wall , so that one would be able to go directly from the foyer to the ballroom without having to go through the kitchen , that John Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that John Denver was one of the Mayor 's favorite singers , that John Denver was going to sing " Rocky Mountain High , " one of the Mayor 's favorite songs , and that the menu for the luncheon included marinated scallops , chicken breasts Florentine , lemon rice , gingered carrots , and apple tart , all made the way the Mayor understood that Premier Zhao liked his food , and no rare red meat , no heavy sauces , because the Mayor is particular about the food he eats , too ; to have the Premier sit down at one of the ten tables for ten , with John Denver on one side and the Mayor on the other , the others at that table being Mrs. John D. Rockefeller 3rd , David Margolis ( husband of Barbara ) , Chinese Ambassador Wenjin Zhang , Ford Foundation President Franklin Thomas , Selwa Roosevelt ( State DeTHE NEW YORKER. partment Protocol Chief ) , and two interpreters ; and , at a nearby lectern , to exchange the gifts of the crystal sculpture and the porcelain vase for real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good dishes , the hundred-piece set embossed with the city seal , had to be brought out . The chef had to be instructed that the Chinese do n't like carrots or other vegetables overcooked . John Denver had to be reached at his home in Aspen and invited to come to New York and to he prepared to sing an encore ? " Shanghai Breezes , " which he had written ( he eventually told the Premier at the table ) during his recent concert tour in China . Red flags  --  a big standing one and ten tiny ones for the luncheon tables  --  each with one big five-pointed yellow star and four little five-pointed yellow stars , had to be obtained . The city 's official brown leather guestbook had to be brought from City Hall to the Gracie Mansion library , where the Premier was asked to sign it . The 26th Army Band of New York had to be invited to come from Fort Hamilton to the mansion porch , where it was asked to play marches but no national anthems , because too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cocktail-music pianist , had to be brought from Queens to the living room to play unobtrusive show tunes on the Steinway baby grand and then to the ballroom to play more unobtrusive tunes on a smaller baby grand during lunch . Mrs. Rockefeller , Mr. Thomas , Mr. Margolis , Mrs. Roosevelt , and John Denver had to be told that the Premier and his entourage had come from a morning of sightseeing  --  the Chinese Garden and the galleries for Chinese paintings at the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the observation deck of the World Trade Center , and a Circle Line boat trip from Battery Park to the Statue of Liberty  --  so there would be ample material for small talk . It turned out that most of the small talk at the table was dominated by Mayor Koch , who was preoccupied with having learned that the Premier was coming down with a cold . Mayor Koch kept telling the Premier he must be sure to take the Mayor 's mother 's recipe for a cold : strong hot tea with honey in a glass it had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also turned out that the Premier had to leave the lunch before dessert , missing the apple tart arid the tea in a glass , which the Mayor had ordered up . " This one really worked out beautifully , " Mrs. Coffey told us . " The Mayor got a call around the first of December from C. A. Howlett , Special Assistant to President Reagan for Intergovernment Affairs , asking him to give the luncheon . The Mayor said of course . He just loves to entertain . He loves having people eat at Gracie Mansion . On Sunday afternoon , December 11th , we had our first big meeting , right here at the Mansion , with twenty members of the Chinese advance delegation , plus two people from the New York City Police Department , plus half a dozen from the White House , plus a few Secret Service men . We sat around the library over coffee , tea , and homemade coffee cake . Most of the Chinese were men , mostly wearing dark business suits . Not mandarin collars . Not Brooks Brothers or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new , either . We reviewed everything , including where the Premier would stand in the receiving line . We needed only three more meetings after that , one of them to study the floor plan of the mansion . " " This one was easy to choreograph , " Mrs. Cahill said . " All we did was the luncheon . The White House insisted on taking the sightseeing . And we had just had a kind of preview with Chen Xitong , the Mayor of Peking , and his seven-member Friendship Delegation . We had them for a whole week . And we did all of it . Not only a dinner . We had him planting a friendship city tree ' in Central Park , and visiting the City Council , Bellevue Hospital , the Bureau of Traffic Operations , the Chase Manhattan Bank , Chinatown , I.B.M. , Lincoln Center ( fourteen tickets to The Nutcracker ' ) , the Metropolitan Museum , the Manhattan Center of Science and Mathematics , the New York City Transit Authority , the Police Department , the Roosevelt Island Garbage Disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trade Center , and Radio City Music Hall . That was a tough one . " " Mayor Chen gave us the warmup , " Mrs. Coffey said . " Premier Zhao was like doing a TV special live . "
