Jerusalem is becoming a showcase of enlightened planning <P> Not all news from the Middle East is atrocious . Amid turmoil , inflation and internal dissension , unperturbed by recent terrorist bombings in West Jerusalem , some Israelis are persistent in building a truly modern city whose past is a living part of the present . <P> Officially divided in 1949 as a result of the Israeli-Jordanian armistice agreement , Jerusalem was reunited by the Israelis in the Six-Day War of 1967 . The city 's urban designers now see their task as the creation of a city so livable and so interwoven that no one will ever want or be able to divide it again . This is being accomplished cooperatively by Jews , Muslims and Christians , whose often volatile emotions are embedded in every stone . <P> " At first , in the euphoria of clearing minefields and barbed-wire fences , " says Jerusalem 's city engineer and chief planner , Amnon Niv , " we shared the conventional modern planning wisdom that progress comes rushing down on a network of superhighways and that affluence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Teddy Kollek , recalls that David Ben-Gurion , who had been Israel 's first Prime Minister , even talked of demolishing the Old City wall to make Jerusalem free and open . <P> But the Israeli planners soon turned to studying Jerusalem 's needs instead of international-style manifestoes to fashion their own city rather than another Brasilia . Heeding Historian Lewis Mumford 's advice , they looked not to Baron Haussmann , who in the mid-19th century modernized Paris by cutting boulevards through the city 's medieval fabric , but to Isaiah 65 : 19 , 21 : " And I will rejoice in Jerusalem and joy in my people . .. and they shall build houses , and inhabit them . " <P> <P> In the walled Old City , which rests like a crown above the new sectors , modern buildings mingle harmoniously with ancient shrines and even millenniums-old archaeological finds . Beyond the restored wall , a few bare and square high-rises and housing projects , built during the ' 60s , mar the serene drama of the biblical landscape with its cypresses , legendary hills and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows respect for history and nature as well as hope for human harmony . <P> The shift from an emphasis on technocratic grandiosity to humanistic sensitivity , an approach that other cities might heed , is largely due to the work of the Jerusalem Committee , initiated in 1968 by Mayor Kollek . The group is made up of some 100 architects , urbanists , historians and theologians from 25 countries ; its members include Mumford , Architect Philip Johnson , the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh of the University of Notre Dame , former CBS Chairman William S. Paley and German Educator Hellmut Becker . Asking the committee 's advice is Kollek 's way of saying that Jerusalem belongs not only to Jews but to world civilization . Said the mayor to the committee after the first meeting : " You are like parents trying to tell your children not to make the same mistakes you made . " <P>
