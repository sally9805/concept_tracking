The business of photographing in a war zone carries inevitable risks , and in Lebanon , just about the riskiest war zone in the world , no one takes unnecessary chances or travels any place where the risks ominously outweigh the opportunities . But says TIME Photographer Bill Pierce , " Some days you are wrong . One day last week we were wrong . " Pierce , Associated Press Photographer Bill Foley and their Lebanese driver had been headed to get pictures in the Bekaa Valley when Syrian soldiers at a checkpoint about 50 miles northeast of Beirut ordered them out of their car and threatened to kill them as spies . <P> One officer hit Pierce in the shoulder while a soldier pressed a Kalashnikov assault rifle into his back . Another officer struck Foley in the face several times and leveled a 9-mm pistol at his head . The soldiers severely beat the driver , who suffered a broken finger and thumb as well as multiple bruises . Pierce was bound with wire and taken to a Syrian military headquarters in Tripoli . <P> Says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before we reached Tripoli . But once there , we were unbound , served coffee and juice and interrogated almost conversationally . After a few phone calls to verify our credentials , we were released , with profuse apologies from the officer in charge . " Except for the driver 's wounds , the chief regret for Pierce , who won the 1982 Overseas Press Club award for photoreporting from abroad , and Foley , Pulitzer prizewinner for 1982 for his photos of the Beirut massacre ( one of which appeared on TIME 's Sept. 27 cover in most editions ) : no pictures that day . <P> <P> There are no Los Angeles natives , it is said , only immigrants . For the contributors to this week 's cover story , the clich was nearly true : Bureau Chief Benjamin Gate has been there only two years , while Correspondent Steven Holmes transferred from Chicago last year , Alessandra Stanley arrived six months before that , and Joseph Kane came five years ago . Picture Researcher Martha Haymaker has seniority with 15 years ' residence . But an exception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up statistics more current than the U.S. Census Bureau 's , is a lifelong Angeleno.
