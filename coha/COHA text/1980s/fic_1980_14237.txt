It is the evening hour and the play is ready to begin . The shadows are thick in the woods beyond the wide and empty stage now , and as the audience lights go down , the gloaming spreads up through the seating area and to the rain shelters and covered area at the rear . The announcing voice is heard in the sound track . VOICE Good evening , ladies and gentlemen , welcome to the " Louisiana Cavalier . " We are honored to have with us tonight  --  Here follows the introduction of any special guest or guests present . A spotlight picks them out . After the applause , the overture strikes up . As it plays , a greenish light fades in on the pine forest at the rear of the center stage , rising from the ground and illuminating the foliage in a mystic suffusion . NOTE : Here the director may decide to use the " ten flags over Louisiana " procession which we discussed . The overture lasts some two to three minutes . As it ends , the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in again.Our play opens in these Louisiana woods . It is an early spring day in the year seventeen hundred and thirteen  --  nearly three hundred years ago  --  and the spirit of the deer-hunting is abroad among the young Indian braves . The frolicsome deer likewise finds joy in the sunny happy weather . ( A sudden flurry of drumsticks sounds from an Indian drum offscene . It continues for a moment . The light comes in on the main stage at the center and rear . An Indian hunter bounds in from the right front , carrying his bow in his hand . Again a flurry of drumstrokes and a second hunter springs in from the left front . He also carries a bow . The two are naked save for their loincloths . The drum sets up a regular beat , and the two hunters in choreo graphed action pantomime the movements of hunters seeking their quarry . They move in dance here , there , and turn in wide searchings , looking off , listening . An antlered deer head pokes itself up from behind the drop-off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself farther , peers right and left , sees the hunters and drops out of sight . As the hunters stand still , the drum is silent . It sets up again , and the hunters in dance movement go away up the sidestage areas right and left into the woods . Now the sprinkly notes of an offscene Indian flute or recorder are heard , bubbling and floating above the rhythmic drumbeats . The antlered head appears again at the rear , watches , listens , seems satisfied and lifts itself higher , revealing the torso of the deer dancer . The drum and the flute continue encouragingly , and the figure clambers agilely up onto the stage at the rear . The dancer is a young man , dressed in a skintight , clay-colored long " union suit . " A stubby deer tail sprouts behind . The hunters are gone now , there is no danger here . A burst of dance movements , animal spirits now , the joy of being a young deer and alive in these woods  --  all in rhythm to the flute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there . He sees tufts of green grass , nibbles , tastes , savors happily . There the budding twigs of the cooperating trees are waiting . He lifts his mouth , reaches , again nibbles , enjoys . Forgetting all , he dances his zest for life , his gratitude to the father sun who sends his beams and blessings on all creatures , even on that terrible enemy  --  man . The flute and drum increase their encouragement , and he responds with more and more dance fervor . The hunters creep in from the right and left front , their bows drawn . No arrows are used , only pantomimed . The flute shrieks a warning but too late , and the drum also too late gives its frantic flurry of beatings . The deer lunges away but is headed off by the first hunter . Then back again he springs , only to be met by the second . Now occurs the hunter-deer dance sequence  --  the deer trying to escape and the hunters maneuvering to shoot him with their arrows . The deer flees in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hindering his escape  --  all in dance movement and theatrical terms . The hunters have pantomimed drawing arrows from their quivers and fitting them to their bowstrings . Now they let fly at the deer . The drumbeat emphasizes the thudding plop of the arrow as the deer is hit and the wailing flute expresses its pain . The deer is badly hurt , his actions slowed . But with a burst of new life he tries to flee . Again a discharge of the cruel arrows , and again he is hit  --  as the drum and flute testify . He staggers , twists this way and that , writhing toward the rear . The first hunter springs at him , pantomiming drawing his hunting knife the while . He seizes an antler , the second hunter rushes in to help . And now comes the deadly knife stroke at the helpless throat . The antlered head falls back , the body is seized with convulsions , and it rolls finally over the edge of the drop-off out of sight in death . The drum beats , the flute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secure their quarry . A moment passes . Two other Indians appear , lifting an actual deer 's body up onto the stage . They clamber up after it , bows looped over their shoulders . They bear the deer toward the right sidestage area . The light widens and we see St. Denis and his men entering at the right front . The roly-poly Doctor Jalot is in front . He is playing a marching melody on his flute . With St. Denis are a number of his men , strong , hardy fellows . One of them carries the French flag . They are all dressed in rough outdoor clothes and carry muskets , and some of them carry bedrolls strapped across their shoulders . Also with St. Denis and his men is a young Indian chief , Little Star . He is accompanied by a couple of his warriors . The three wear red headbands . The deer is laid at the feet of Little Star . He now presents it to St. Denis. ) p. 3 LITTLE STAR For my friend , Captain St. Denis , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teelo dee . Friends now and always . ST . DENIS Teelo dee ! Lee naso toom teh wayso . Our people will be happy , happy . LITTLE STAR We be happy . ( He and St. Denis shake hands Indian fashion and each places his hand on the forehead of the other , then touches his own breast , attesting his sincerity . Little Star 's men bring forward a basket of supplies and bundles . These also are presented to St. Denis . Jalot gives a skirl with his flute . ) ST . DENIS Cheers for Chief Little Star , our friend . VOICES Cheers ! Cheers ! ST . DENIS ( Loudly . ) Back to the colony , men ! VOICES Back to Natchitoches . OTHER VOICES To the colony ! ( St. Denis and Little Star lead the way now , side by side . They move up the berm at the center rear and the men , led by Jalot 's flute , break into song as they go . Little Star and his men grunt along as they can in their fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . DENIS AND MEN Oh , Louisiana is our home , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A land that 's fair and free  --  With hearts to win her we have come  --  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Across the raging sea . ( As they are about to disappear over the berm a loud halloo is heard at the far left of the audience . A spotlight picks out an Indian runner there . He is shouting as he comes. ) p. 4 INDIAN Ah-oom ! Ah-ooh ! Hey ! ( St. Denis and his men stop and look around . The Indian tears along the stage and up to St. Denis . He bows . ) Lay to sin ay ee ! I give you this . ( He hands St. Denis a little flat weather-stained packet . St. Denis looks at him , reaches out and touches his face in a friendly manner . ) ST . DENIS Yon num ti soha wosi neen mati . I receive it gladly and will take it to my governor . ( Jalot and two or three men crowd up . The Indian waves his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dashes back the way he came . ) JALOT What is it , Mon Cavalier ? ST . DENIS A letter . ( He lifts it against the light . ) It has been long on its journey  --  old and weather-worn . JALOT It looks like evil news . Let us open it , sir . ST . DENIS That 's for Governor Bienville to do . ( The flute and the singing , then the drum , begin again , and the little cortege with the supplies moves over the berm and out at the rear center . ) MEN Let not our hands grow weak , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; With one brave voice speak , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Then hail to Louisiana ! &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Louisiana hail ! ( The singing and flute and drum die out . The light dies , and after a moment we hear the loud sound of a bell coming from the left front stage area . The light comes up there. ) p. 5 p. 6 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene 2 The fort at Natchitoches . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as Fort St. Jean Baptiste . As the light comes up , Adam Bejous , an elderly watchman holding a pike in one hand , is clanging a large bell which hangs from a crosspiece at the left center . The French national flag flares out from a pole attached to one of the palisades . Julian Landrau , an armed soldier , is walking his post in front of the entrance to the fort . Bejous finishes his bell-ringing , turns and calls through the air in his great voice . BEJOUS Five o'clock by the glass and all is well  --  ( Moving up toward the rear )  --  all is well in Natchitoches ! God save His Majesty , Louis the Fourteenth , King of France and the Western lands ! All is well ! LANDRAU ( With a snort . ) Liar ! Crying out " All is well ! " BEJOUS Mark ye , Governor Bienville  --  ( And he gestures toward the fort at the left. )  --  he says to me , says he , " Adam Bejous , ever call out good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colony spirit . " LANDRAU There are no good tidings of late about this colony . We are perishing . BEJOUS If all complained like you , we would perish . p. 7 LANDRAU And members of the Council say the same . Mark ye , Councilman Francois Olivier  --  he says give over this sinking colony and return home to France . BEJOUS Olivier  --  a new man ! LANDRAU But solid . ( He taps his forehead . ) BEJOUS ( Strongly . ) The Governor and St. Denis wo n't let us perish . When the Cavalier returns from his exploring  --  LANDRAU Return  --  return . Weeks we 've waited for him . I doubt not he and his men lie scalped by the Indians in a gully somewhere in yonder darksome wilderness . ( He paces his post . In the background there are several colonists who show by their round-shouldered and halting walk they are weak and ill . ) BEJOUS ( With almost a shout . ) No , I tell you  --  no ! St. Denis ever makes friends with the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the Indians respect and fear . Our Governor knows so . BEJOUS St. Denis believes different  --  he does . ( He clatters the bell and turns toward the left , resuming his call . ) All is well ! The weather clear  --  the sunset fair  --  ( He stops suddenly and listens . Far off at the right the sound of Jalot 's gay flute is heard . Bejous rushes over to the right center and looks off . Landrau stops his pacing and looks off also . Bejous gives a loud cry . ) I see the flag ! ' T is St. Denis ! Hourra  --  hourra ! ( The sound of the flute and little drum comes nearer . Landrau draws himself up and walks his post in better military precision . Bejous rings the bell and runs off at the left calling to the people there as he goes . ) St. Denis is coming ! St. Denis ! Assemble ! Assemble ! ( He re-enters . A hubbub of voices begins off at the left center . The colonists come pushing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women . A medley of voices is raised. ) p. 8 VOICES The Holy Mother answered our prayers ! OTHER VOICES Blessed be God above ! STILL OTHERS The Governor ! Make way for His Excellency Governor Bienville ! ( Bienville enters from the left . He is in ordinary dress and wears a sword . His dark hat is small and has no plume . With him is Lieutenant Philippe Blondel , a young man of twenty-two or-three in uniform . Also Chief Blanc , head of the Natchitoches Indians , is with him , impressive and elderly . The colonists are not an imposing lot in their poor clothes and with their somewhat slothful movements  --  though for the moment they are energized more than usual . Among these we notice Bertha Guizot , a soft-featured , attractive woman of 35 or so . She hurries forward to greet the oncoming party . More colonists , including a few children , enter from the rear , some of them carry working tools  --  an axe , shovel , seythe , rake or hoe , as if just come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Governor Bienville , now crowd forward as St. Denis and his men enter . St. Denis and Little Star are in front . ) VOICES Vivat ! Vivat ! Louis Juchereau ! ST . DENIS Ah  --  mes enfants ! OTHER VOICES Vivat our Louisiana Cavalier ! STILL OTHERS Home  --  safe home ! At last ! At last ! p. 9 A VOICE We feared for you ! ANOTHER VOICE We prayed for you . Hail to the blessed Virgin ! ST . DENIS ( With a wide stretch of his long arms . ) Mes amis ! JALOT ( Loudly . ) And well ye all prayed  --  else the sucking quagmires would have swallowed us up . ( To Bertha , groaning . ) Oh , my thorn-ravaged legs. ! BERTHA I will tend you , my precious one . ( Some of the people laugh . Bertha looks about her . ) He is a hero  --  and why not soothe him after his great labors ! BIENVILLE ( Genially . ) True , Mademoiselle Guizot . We honor the doctor Medar Jalot . ( To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He moves over to St. Denis and salutes him with his sword . St. Denis answers back with his . ) We welcome you most warmly , sir . ST . DENIS ( Sheathing his sword . ) My respects , Your Excellency ! ( They embrace and the Governor kisses him on the cheeks . The people applaud . Bertha is seen at the front hugging Jalot tightly now . He wriggles a bit in her embrace . ) BIENVILLE And now after your long harsh journeyings , you brave men must crave to be with your loved ones ! ( The men drop their bags and add to the moment of reunion , reaching their hungry arms for their women folk . Ad lib greetings among the men and the waiting women , kisses and embracings . " I dreamed and dreamed , and now I hold my dream in my arms ! " " I 've been good , so good while you were gone ! " " One more kiss - yes , yes . " " It was cold , cold the nights  --  and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ah , mon amour . " A number of the lonesome men have watched the greetings enviously. ) p. 10 VOICES Food ! You have brought food ! ST . DENIS Your Excellency  --  people  --  ( announcingly. )  --  food from Chief Little Star ! ( Loudly . ) We have made a treaty of friendship with him and his father old Feathered Eagle . ( Applause , St. Denis leads Little Star to the Governor . ) Our Governor ! ( Bienville and Little Star greet each other in Indian fashion . ) BIENVILLE May we live in friendship  --  even as we live in peace with our friend Chief Blanc , ruler of the Natchitoches . ( He presents Chief Blanc . ) ST . DENIS And this message , your Excellency , brought to me by a runner from the west . ( He gives the packet to Bienville . The people show their curosity by pushing up . ) BIENVILLE This hour is rich with heaven 's favor . ( Loudly . ) The Colony Council will hear these important matters from our Cavalier . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Calling out a little brashly . ) And the news is good ! Tres Bon ! ( Applause . ) VOICES Bon ! OTHERS Food ! Food ! ( The men shoulder their babs again , and a number of people cluster around them , some touching the bags joyfully . ) ( Jalot with Bertha by his side strikes up the marching song with his flute and all move out , singing as they go ) p. 11 PEOPLE ( Led by St. Denis and Bienville . ) Let not our hands grow weak , &nbsp; With One brave voice speak. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Sing Hail to Louisiana , &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Blessed may she be ! ( They disappear at the left center . The singing carries on in the distance . The scene fades out . After a moment , the music dies . The darkness holds a little longer . Bienville 's voice is heard at the left sidestage area . The light comes up there. ) p. 12 Act 1 , Scene 3 Scene 3 An office room inside the fort  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A striking feature is a large bust of Louis XIV in the rear center of the room . A tall flag of France stands on either side of it . When the light comes up , Bienville is speaking . BIENVILLE Messieurs , our Cavalier St. Denis has brought back much good news . Not only has he signed a treaty with Little Star and his father , Feathered Eagle , but in his wide exploring he discovered a well-marked trail leading to the west to the Spanish country . This is full of possibilities for us . And still more , he brought a most important letter  --  addressed to the Governor of Louisiana  --  written some two years ago from a Spanish priest  --  ( He emphasizes the word " Spanish . " )  --  one Father Hidalgo . ( He holds up the letter , a wizened little packet . ) ST . DENIS The Indian runner had received it from another runner and he from still another , a Tejas Indian from the west . God has wondrously preserved it , eh , Dr. Jalot ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks upward and crosses himself . ) BIENVILLE ( Almost sternly . ) Messieurs , the question before this Council is. should we attempt trade with the Spanish to the west. as Captain St. Denis has long urged to save this colony ! ( Reaction to this , mostly unfavorable . ) Captain St. Denis . ( He hands St. Denis the open little packet and stands aside . St. Denis steps forward. ) p. 13 ST . DENIS The grandson of our own sovereign  --  ( He indicates the statue. )  --  now sits on the Spanish throne as Philip the Fifth . If ever an attempt at friendship between the two peoples in the new world is to be made , now is the time to make it . OLIVIER Two years ago the Governor sent some goods by ship to Vera Cruz and it was not allowed in the harbor . You were  --  we were lucky it was not sunk by the Spanish guns . ST . DENIS ( Glancing at him sharply . ) If we failed by sea , perhaps we can succeed by land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west have milk-cows and beef cattle , buffalo hides , oxen and horses with which our people could till their fields and raise crops and feed our children.Silver too they have from their mines . Our next ship will bring us goods in plenty from France 's labor overflow . The Spaniards are lacking these . ( Tapping the letter . ) We have proof of this  --  the Father 's pleading letter . They need what we have , and we need what they have . I have read that the Viceroy of Spanish Mexico is a humane man . RAMBIN No matter what we do , His Majesty is discouraged with us . New colonists do not come . OLIVIER Wives for the lonely men have long been promised . Where are they ? p. 14 VOICES True , true , Monsieur Olivier . BIENVILLE We expect them on the next ship  --  that is already due . OLIVIER ( Gesturing . ) Cavalier St. Denis must remember that trade is forbidden . The old Spanish ordinance says so . ST . DENIS But when the church itself urges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statute above service to God . The piteous words of Father Hidalgo are most moving . ( Reading from the letter . ) " Slowly and before my anguished eyes my mission is perishing . Now in pain of heart I turn to you , our brothers in Christ . You are French , we are Spanish . But , one immortal faith , one Mother Church binds us together in common humanity , as God 's children on earth . " ( He thumps the paper . ) BIENVILLE A piteous plea . ( Murmurs once more . ) ST . DENIS It is the Mother Church , calling to us , her sons . ( Reading . ) " Your supplies and goods would offer us hope . Mexico City can give none . It is too far away . We cry for your mercy and your help . Signed , Francisco Hidalgo . " ( He stands holding the letter in his hand , his voice strong . ) Supplies and goods the Father calls for  --  trade ! The Mission calls for trade , The Church calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that call . ( He looks from one member to the other. ) p. 15 BIENVILLE What is your pleasure , messieurs ? VOICES ( Led by St. Denis . ) I vote aye ! VOICES ( Led by Olivier . ) I vote nay ! BIENVILLE Your hands , s'il vous plait . The ayes ? ( St. Denis , Jalot , Largen and Blondel hold up hands . ) The nays ? ( Olivier , Rambin , Penicault and Derbanne hold up hands . ) Four in favor and four against . By your oath as Councilmen you will abide in good faith with the majority . VOICES ( Some slothfully . ) We will . BIENVILLE By virtue of my office I vote aye , making the majority . ( Reactions pro and con . ) When our goods arrive , we will attempt trade with the Spaniards  --  Captain St. Denis to head the venture . Meanwhile let us take all means to strengthen our settlement . BIENVILLE Bonne nuit , messieurs . ( He bows dismissingly to the members . ) MEMBERS Bonne nuit . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saluting the statue as they go . He turns to St. Denis . ) OLIVIER I am a new member of the council as the Governor may have told you . p. 16 ST . DENIS Oui , Monsieur Olivier . OLIVIER I arrived here during your absence on exploration . ST . DENIS I hear so . You were shipwrecked . OLIVIER And swam ashore . ( Crossing himself . ) A merciful God preserved me . Monsieur St. Denis  --  ( Bowing. )  --  Your Excellency  --  I repeat my discomfort at this decision to attempt trade with the Spanish . It can not succeed , and I would fear for your neck if you fell into Spanish hands . ST . DENIS I hope to preserve my neck , Monsieur Olivier . OLIVIER God be with you . ( He goes . St. Denis looks after him . ) ST . DENIS ( To Bienville . ) Do you trust this man ? BIENVILLE No one works harder in the Colony . ST . DENIS ( Almost abruptly . ) I would watch him . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may all the saints bless you . The Colony will live . BIENVILLE ( Soberly . ) It depends now , mon ami , mainly on you . If you fail  --  ( He shrugs . They embrace . Bienville turns , then lightly taps St. Denis on the shoulders . ) And when you 're in the Spanish country , take care , Louis , as to those Spanish senoritas with their dark eyes . p. 17 ST . DENIS You know I am a reformed man , Your Excellency ! ( Bienville chuckles as he goes out , giving a slight salute to the statue . St. Denis takes his folded map and plumed hat and turns away . In the distance the voice of Adam Bejous calls the hour ) BEJOUS ' VOICE Ten o'clock ! Ten o'clock and all is well ! ( The scene fades out . After a moment the light comes on in a spot at the front center and Jalot appears there . This time he is without his flute and medicine bag . He is the Narrator . ) JALOT So the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later with tools and factory supplies a-plenty. but without any women for wives . ( tramping . The light brightens on him once more . ) JALOT Across the land we moved , keeping a lookout for Father Hidalgo and his mission . And through trade and gifts , friendship was established with the various Indian tribes , and the Cavalier learned much of their languages . ( He gestures toward the rear of the center stage . The lights fade down on him . In the darkness a little Indian drum starts its regular tapping . An Indian woman 's voice begins crooning offscene and continuing above the drumbeat . The light comes up at the rear in an eyeblink scene , carved as it were , out of the surrounding darkness . The drum and solo voice serve as a sort of accompaniment to the scene , the pantomime of which is somewhat choreographed . NOTE : The director can develop the action here as is creatively most satisfactory . A happy chief is receiving a " hatchet " from St. Denis . He tries it out with choppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and arm in affectionate thanks . More " goods " are handed out from an invisible bin  --  a " hoe " which Largen shows the way of using . An Indian boy receives a " hunting knife " and proudly exhibits it to his mother who receives a " pot " or " bucket " and joyfully holds it up for others to see , giving a few jigging dance steps the while . A young maid receives a " hand mirror " and sees her face in it , gives giggles and a small whicker of delight , lets others gather close about her to see their own reflected faces . Then a few " bits of cloth " are given out , some " trinkets " and " baubles "  --  and so on , whatever will give the best effect in something less than two minutes time . A jubilant little scene . The Indians gather close about St. Denis and the chief in friendship . Fade out , the drum dies , and the light returns to Jalot as he continues . ) Our loyal Natchitoches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters were received from there now and then . All went well in friendship and trading with the native Indians till we neared the Rio Grande country . One night when we were resting by our campfire , a band of wandering Apaches , down from the western hills , raided our camp . We drove them off and rescued a prisoner . They left one of their number killed  --  a good specimen for my dissecting knife . ( The light fades as he walks into the darkness . After a moment it comes up on the right side-stage area. ) p. 18 p. 19 Act 1 , Scene 4 Scene 4 A campsite on the western plain , a small fire going somewhat in the background . A number of St. Denis ' men are making their bivouac . A French flag flies from a staff stuck in the ground . St. Denis is sitting by the fire studying his map . At the right is the recumbent figure of the " dead " Indian , a blanket over his head . Jalot enters and stands by him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saluting . ) We have tallied the new goods that have arrived , sir , all accounted for . PENICAULT The Apaches got nothing . ST . DENIS ( Returning the salute . ) Tres bon ! And we will need it all , I hope , for the Spaniards . ( Jubilantly . ) In two days or more , by my maps , we should reach a Coahuila settlement . ( To Largen . ) See that our Natchitoches Indian bearers are well cared for . PENICAULT They are well fed , sir , on buffalo meat out there . ( He gestures off . ) ( Jalot squats by the " dead " Indian . Largen calls out . ) LARGEN Dr. Jalot , you want us to bury that Indian or leave him for the vultures ? JALOT First I must give him some scientific consideration . ( He feels the naked abdomen and thighs of the Indian . ) Later I will open him with my knife and remove his liver . The spleen too I will remove and let loose the dark and angry humors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color and texture of the spleen . ( He pulls the blanket from around the Indian 's head and gazes at him . ) A fierce looking monsieur but now all serene in the humility of death . ( He grabs the Indian 's head , twists it fiercely to one side and with rough fingers , opens the sullen mouth . He leans over him to look down his throat , then jumps back and fans the air viciously with his hand . ) Sapristi ! He must be far gone with the rotted guts . ( He reaches for his bag . Talon kicks at the fire . The light brightens . Jalot begins whetting his knife on a little stone he carries , honing it to razor edge . ) Uhm  --  uhm  --  first to test his virilite masculinos  --  ahm  --  ahm  --  his lentille pendule . ( He reaches to tear away the Indian 's loincloth when the voice of Ponti is heard at the rear of the scene. ) p. 20 PONTI 'S VOICE Help here , doctor ! ( Ponti and Dupuy come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European clothes . Jalot rises to meet them . St. Denis , who has started to lie down , turns and comes over . ) PONTI The Apaches wounded him . ( St. Denis holds out his blanket to spread it down , but Jalot indicates the wounded man should kneel . He does so , and Jalot examines his bloody shoulder . ) JALOT ( Chortling . ) A beautiful wound  --  beautiful  --  and deep  --  ah ! ( He works on the shoulder . Bernardino makes no reaction . He is a middle-aged man and of stocky figure . ) BERNARDINO A spear stick in me  --  Apaches . ( Jalot cleans the wound , Penicault helping him with a cloth Jalot has taken from his bag . Some of the men have foregone their rest and come forward to watch . ) ST . DENIS You are not Apache . BERNARDINO I am Tejas chief . My name Bernardino  --  give me by Father Hidalgo . ST . DENIS ( Joyously . ) Father Hidalgo ! Then you know where we can find him . BERNARDINO ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father is gone . ( Pointing . ) Stones  --  walls  --  all down . Father to Mexico City for help . But no help . ( Shaking his head and wiping his eyes . ) But Father Hidalgo come no more . Me and my Angelina , we leave , come to the mission there  --  San Juan Bautista . Father Paul the priest there . I help him  --  help the Comandante in the presidio. p. 21 ST . DENIS San Juan Bautista  --  how far ? BERNARDINO One day  --  there ahead  --  uno dias . I come to visit my father 's grave . The Apaches take me , take my horse . JALOT ( Finishing with Bernardino . ) It is not a beautiful wound . He will be well in a few days . ( He takes his bag and squats down by the Apache again . ) But I still have my prize beauty here . In him there is no disappointment . ST . DENIS ( To Bernardino . ) I will return you to the Comandante safe and sound . BERNARDINO Mil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ palm . He feels along the Indian 's belly . ) JALOT Dead , quite dead . Hah , he wears a bloated woods tick in his navel for a good luck charm . I shall remove that organ first . ( He squeezes up a handful of flesh and makes a tentative touch . The recumbent Indian gives a great shriek and lunges upward in the air . At the same time he grabs up dirt and flings it blindingly into Jalot 's face . He tears out at the right , war-whooping as he goes , knocks Talon 's musket aside as he runs , and disappears into the darkness . Talon springs after him , firing his musket uselessly . Jalot sits on the ground sputtering and blubbering and working at his eyes . St. Denis hurries to him and helps him with his kerchief . ) Merci beaucoup . p. 22 ST . DENIS ( In good-natured mockery . ) " Dead , quite dead . " JALOT Bah ! ( Jalot puts his knife back into his bag . St. Denis turns to his rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray . ( At this moment a runner enters with a message which is given to St. Denis . ) St. Denis reads . ) ST . DENIS " Your presence has been discovered and as enemies to Spain you are forthwith ordered to leave this land or suffer . " JALOT O , lord-a-mercy ! How many miles back . My feet , my poor feet . Ha-ha-ha , those senoritas they talk about . ST . DENIS Tomorrow we move straight ahead to the presidio . ( To the men . ) To prayers , men . ( The men kneel , and some of them cross themselves . The scene fades out . For an instant there is silence . Then suddenly from the center stage gay Spanish music and laughter burst forth , and the light flares up there. ) p. 23 Act 1 , Scene 5 Scene 5 The patio and inner garden of the Comandante 's house at the Presidio del Norte , a few miles south of the Rio Grande River . The Spanish flag flies from its pole at the rear . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect is underway , some four or five couples , men and women  --  all to the gay offscene Spanish dance music . Several people are standing or sitting on the " verandah " enjoying the dance . Among these is Don Diego Ramon , the Comandante of the Presidio . Nearby is Father Paul , the priest , in his cassock . Of all the dancers the one that engages our interest most is Manuela Ramon , an attractive dark-haired young woman . She dances with fire and zest , her lips parted , her eyes half-closed as her body and the music call to each other and answer passionately . Her partner in the dance is Don Gaspardo Anya , the Governor of the Province of Coahuila . He is somewhat middle-aged , a bit inclined to stoutness but of imposing military appearance and of lively energy . The dance builds to a climax and ends . The people applaud . VOICES Manuela !
