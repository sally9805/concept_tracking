In a city that has served as many symbols - the paragon of industrial might and then the nadir of urban unrest and disintegration - focusing attention on such a half-empty building suggests the contradictions of Newark today. // Although something encouraging is definitely occurring - a healthy crop of office buildings is under way , and hundreds of town houses are being built in the devastated Central Ward - the outward form conceals a core still partly hollow. // What is happening in Newark illuminates what cities across the state and nation have been forced to confront . Having lost their manufacturing bases and , thus , their original reason for being , they struggle to do no less than recreate themselves. // " One of the great questions is whether the older cities like Newark can be recycled , " Samuel M. Ehrenhalt , regional commissioner of labor statistics for the Federal Department of Labor , said . " The 1980 ' s have only deepened the question. " // Long after the rest of New Jersey triumphantly emerged from a long economic recession , Newark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take part . Newark ' s part has been modest. // Unemployment has dropped , to 7. 9 percent , half the rate of a few years ago but twice the state average . Workers are rushing to put glass walls on a $62 million office building near Pennsylvania Station , and construction is to begin on two other towers in that area . But suburbs one-tenth the size of the city have boasted of similar projects. // Housing prices have risen 50 percent since 1980 . But they rose 300 percent in Jersey City and Hoboken . And although a large home builder has come in from the suburbs to build badly needed town houses in the Central Ward , the first 168 are selling for more than $90 , 000 , out of reach for many city residents. // Some analysts believe the good fortune of Newark has hinged on the suburban market ' s becoming so congested and expensive that the city , with its open land and low prices , began attracting attention . But the experts also worry that just as the city begins to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of flagging. // " The real danger for Newark , " an assistant director of the State Planning Office , Martin Bierbaum , said , " is that when you look at what has happened to the suburbs in New Jersey over the last 10 years , Newark has only gotten a little of the overspill. " // The new role that Mayor Sharpe James and his city of 315 , 000 mostly poor and mostly black and Puerto Rican residents appear to have claimed for themselves could hardly be a more dramatic change of identity. // For almost 200 years , Newark was a city of broad shoulders , tall factories and , downtown , powerful insurance and banking concerns . Under Mr. James ' s vision of the future , just the last facet will survive. // In place of laborers , Newark is trying to become a city of students , information handlers and service providers . <> <> Symbolism of Empty Lots // A quick drive through any part shows that the new Newark has not arrived , despite Mr. James ' s marketing campaign . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . In almost every part of the city , something is being built. // Mr. James and his predecessor , Kenneth A. Gibson , have been intent on rebuilding the city with the help of business . But longtime observers said Mr. James ' s enthusiasm and understanding of the power of symbols set him apart. // " Sharpe James will take the time and make the effort to clean up empty lots , because he understands how very important that can be to the psyche of the city , " said Richard Roper , head of the Program for New Jersey Affairs at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton. // But Mr. Roper , who for a time lived and worked in Newark , said that when a city had fallen as far as Newark had , even symbols as strong as the recent dynamiting of several failed high-rise housing projects were not enough. // For Newark , the road to rock bottom has been long and hard , starting as far back as the Depression , The city was increasingly burdened by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 10 miles to the east and the concentration of the poor and minority-group members in a city that itself was too poor to care for them . <> <> Advent of Open Vistas // By the summer of 1967 , when the Central Ward echoed with National Guard rifle shots and the crackle of burning streets , many people had already written off the city . Those with the biggest stake in its future , the residents , fled to the suburbs. // In 1930 , 442 , 000 people lived here . The population is now estimated at 315 , 196 and continues to shrink , though more slowly than before . So many people , businesses and institutions left that great sections of the core were emptied . Then a curious thing occurred . The few who remained saw all that land and began to spread out. // The big businesses downtown - the Prudential Insurance Company of America ; Public Service Electric and Gas , part of the Public Service Enterprise Group , and New Jersey Bell , part of Bell Atlantic - moved or expanded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so large they overlapped and formed what has become a critical mass of more than 30 , 000 people in six colleges and universities , the city library and the Newark Museum . For the future , the state has proposed a $200 million arts center . <> <> Success for Community Group // In the bad times , there were also loyal community groups that established programs using the millions in Federal funds that for a time poured in. // None was more successful than the New Community Corporation and its director , Msgr . William J. Linder . Generally regarded as one of the most productive community groups in the nation , New Community built and maintains 2 , 300 housing units in the Central and West Wards . In many years , its activity provided the only new housing in the city. // Monsignor Linder ' s latest project is a suburban-style shopping center on Bergen Street in the Central Ward that is to have the second supermarket in the city . He hopes the center will be used not only by residents , but also by people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street. // " The key to Newark is this , " Monsignor Linder said . " If we have all these new buildings in town , we ' ve got to somehow get some of the people who work in them to leave some money in Newark . " <> <> Busy During the Day // The downtown shopping area along Broad Street , with hardly an empty storefront , is filled with buses , boom boxes and bargain banners . It is not Madison Avenue , one real-estate specialist said , but it is at least busy during the day. // Most big department stores have closed . Although the grandest , Bamberger ' s , now Macy ' s , remains open , it is just a shadow of the elegant store it once was . Four of the eight main selling floors are open. // Some of those involved in the revitalization said they believed the city ' s attitude of " just ride out the rough times and it will get better " was finally starting to pay off. // " We ' re gambling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , director of commercial property development for Time Equities Inc. , a large Manhattan company that bought an office building designed by Cass Gilbert from Prudential for $11 million in late 1985 . Time Equities is about to begin a $30 million renovation and is said to be negotiating with the state to lease half the building . <> <> ' Crack in the Door ' // Though nervous about the future , Mr. Robbins said all Newark needed was for a major tenant from New York or one moving back from the suburbs to " open a crack in the door. " // But Newark knows its chances depend most of all on itself. // " The answers are not in Washington , not in Trenton , not in the White House , not in the State House , " Mr. James told a group of civic and business leaders recently . " They ' re in this room tonight. " // Perhaps more than any other community in New Jersey , the city has relied on a partnership of business and local government . The reason is simple . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from more than 40 percent of the municipal budget to not a penny. // To make up the gap , Newark has cut back , slimmed down and run itself more like a business . Its tax rate now stands at $14. 46 per $100 of assessed valuation , among the highest in the state and making the burden on homeowners double the state average . <> <> Schools on the Verge // Over the last two years , the city has increased its collections of unpaid taxes , parking fines and other fees , and it has reduced spending . But taxes increased this year anyway , because of the schools , officials said. // By most accounts , the 53 , 000-student school system is on the verge of collapse . The state is threatening to take over its operations . Mr. James said that in one high school , 25 boys graduated from a class of 125 boys. // There are other persistent threats to recovery . Crime remains high , the perception of crime even higher . More than a third of the residents are on some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and AIDS occur at alarming rates . More than 8 , 000 people are estimated to be homeless. // For many here , the new buildings downtown have made little difference in their lives . The production of housing , both private and publicly assisted through the state ' s Mount Laurel low-income initiatives , has quelled many fears about the downtown development ' s not benefiting the neighborhoods. // But there still is concern that many people have already been left out of Newark ' s future. // " The city ' s looking a lot better , " said Alma Hayes , a longtime resident who cleans downtown offices at night . " But it doesn ' t do much for the poor people . Not yet anyway. " //
