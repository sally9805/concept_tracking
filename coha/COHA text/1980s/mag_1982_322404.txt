" My wife is not going to be President " <P> The scene at Manila 's Malacaang Palace leaves little doubt that the two most powerful people in the Philippines are both named Marcos . While President Ferdinand Marcos receives a constant stream of visitors in his study , which is just off the main reception hall , First Lady Imelda Romualdez Marcos holds court next door in the music room . Last week , a few days before leaving on his trip to the U.S. , the President discussed at length his wife , human rights and other issues with TIME Hong Kong Bureau Chief Ross H. Munro and Manila Stringer Nelly Sindayen . Excerpts from the interview : <P> <P> Q. In your statements about the U.S. trip , you leave the impression that you consider yourself a good friend of the U.S. but one who has sometimes been badly treated . <P> A. That 's quite true . It 's time the two countries-the leadership of both countries-look at these matters with more maturity than has been demonstrated so far . <P> <P> Q. Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you and the Philippines were treated badly ? <P> A .. We go all the way back in history : Admiral George Dewey and his promises , the proclamation of independence . When the veterans had to send a mission to the U.S. to claim their rights after the second World War . The Bell Trade Act of 1946 was a symbol of one-sidedness : we were obligated to allow all American products to come into our country free . But eight principal Philippine products were given quotas by the U.S.* And the U.S. reserved the power to impose restrictions on any product imported from the Philippines that would compete with any American product . <P> <P> Q. What about during the Administration of Jimmy Carter , with its emphasis on human rights in foreign policy ? <P> A. It 's not a matter of foreign policy . I would presume it 's more a matter of implementation thereof . We have no quarrel with a policy that seeks to support human rights . In your financing institutions , the instructions under President Carter were either to vote against Philippine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had violated human rights . Many projects had to be delayed . Some of those projects approved only recently had been pending for ten or 15 years . <P> It 's a question of arriving at conclusions based on distorted media and embassy reports . We felt that the Philippines was entitled to more attention in the matter of really determining what was happening . These statements about torture , about alleged misuse of power and things like that insulted the Filipinos more than their leader because it was made to appear as if Filipinos would tolerate a leader who would torture his own people , who would utilize his executive prerogatives for abuses . <P> <P> Q. First Lady Imelda Marcos recently hinted that if the U.S. treats the Philippines shabbily , the Philippines could turn toward the Soviet Union and China . <P>
