&lt; When she looked out from the lectern at 15,000 supporters chanting " Cory ! Cory ! " in Legaspi , 215 miles southeast of Manila , President Corazon Aquino was clearly moved . " I know you still love me , " she said . Indeed they did . Swept into office eleven months ago on a tidal wave of popularity , the former housewife depended on that support to overcome a possible coup last November . But now she may be wondering just how that love will be expressed in the weeks ahead as she deals with a pair of pressing problems . <P> When Filipinos go to the polls on Feb. 2 to vote on a proposed new constitution , the ballot will in effect be a referendum on Aquino . She is putting her immense personal prestige on the line by canvassing the country on behalf of a document that has galvanized her opponents . Meanwhile , negotiations between the government and the National Democratic Front , the political arm of the Communist insurgency , are stalemated . <P> The current round of talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60- day truce that began Dec. 10 between army troops and Communist rebels brought the country 's first peaceful Christmas in 18 years . Since then , however , the sides have been unable to agree on an agenda . At a session last Tuesday , Manila officials offered to discuss " food , freedom , jobs and justice . " The Communists responded with a ten-point list that included penalties for the military 's human rights abuses . The session broke off in confusion , but negotiators agreed to reconvene this week . <P> After meeting with Communist leaders last weekend , Representative Stephen Solarz , a New York Democrat and chairman of a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee , told reporters that there was only a " very slim chance " for peace . Though Aquino maintains that she will use force only as a last resort , Communist Negotiator Antonio Zumel said the New People 's Army " shall remain ready to pull the trigger . " <P> Aquino may have more success with the constitution . The 118-page charter , written by an Aquino-appointed committee , calls for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a cutback in presidential powers and the establishment of a two-chamber congress . Aquino says the document is " worthy of the great collective act that made it possible : the rising of the Filipino people to vindicate their voice . " <P> The President 's opponents are using the ballot to muster support against the regime . Communists oppose the proposed constitution because it does not , they say , redress social injustices . Juan Ponce Enrile , who was fired as Defense Minister last November after allegedly orchestrating a coup attempt and is widely thought to want the presidency , opposes ratification because , he says , Aquino 's abolition of Marcos ' constitution undermined the legitimacy of her own rule . He calls Aquino the " new dictator . " <P> Despite Aquino 's continuing popularity , her staff is no longer predicting a landslide victory . Her press secretary , Teodoro Benigno , says a simple majority of 60% would be " comfortable . " The President is making time-honored political moves to help ensure victory . Last week she approved a sweeping program aimed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Critics are grossly mistaken if they think that Cory is politically naive , " says a top government official . " Enrile should know that by now . "
