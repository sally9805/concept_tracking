But after everybody agreed on that , the question was : Why ? <P> Hardly in terms of immediate results , since there were none . The battle cry of the march was " Now ! " Seas of placards demanded Negro equality-Now ! Speakers demanded action-Now ! Cried John Lewis , 25 , leader of the militant young Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee ( SNICK ) : " We want our freedom-and we want it NOW ! " <P> But Now ! remained a long way off .
