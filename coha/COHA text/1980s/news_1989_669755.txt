We had followed the coast all the way after Trondheim , and it was now our last chance to detour inland to ' ' see ' ' Lapland , that vast , borderless , mysterious territory across Norway , Sweden , Finland , and the Soviet Union , where roads often turn into thin dotted lines on maps and disappear along tracks of stream beds. // ' ' Are you up for it tonight ? ' ' I asked my friend , sitting in a restaurant by the sea in Alta , Norway , 300 miles north of the Arctic Circle. // The vitality of the costumed north bustled around us . In the smoky place in summer , wolf-ruffed parkas hung in the entryway and Lapps themselves walked about in sky-blue flannel with wildflower-embroidered backs . Outside , in the bay , people were unloading a cargo seaplane . Horses and wagons went by , to be passed by a Mercedes or an army vehicle . We were the only people , I was sure , to have reached the top of Norway on two precariously thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what Lapland looks like. ' ' // ' ' We won ' t have anything , if we don ' t have geography , ' ' I said , paraphrasing Hemingway on making a story. // We were looking at a map spread over our bread-sopped plates . From Alta , the northernmost point of land in Europe lay due north on the island of Mageroya. // How often in my daydreams bicycling at night had I seen us roaring up to the North Cape , then off the cliffs into the shining Polar Sea , two shadows of bicycles in the dusk , packs , panniers , flying - because we ' d been unable to stop pedaling . We ' d join a hundred million lemmings swimming out to an island where the great men of renown of Scandinavia still lived. // We ' d paddle , peddling like paddle boats into the sunset . The glory of our battle won would have been against sheer geography , spurred on by the light . The fact of the matter was , we couldn ' t stop . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // After supper we often broke a well-set camp and bicycled again half the night . The night sun was pink adrenalin to our lust for accomplishment to be the first to bike Oslo-Nordkapp . The pink spell was a hoary mist rising at 2 a. m. out of the banks of cold rivers , while everything else slept : The old farms and timbered churches that escaped the flame of German invasion , the birchwoods , dew-dripping berries , northern birds , all were still . The only other time I ' d seen the nocturnal secrets of the countryside revealed was in Vietnam by silver flares on parachutes that spelled out clearly the eerie lay of the land . The cold light worked on us with the craziness of lemmings. // ' ' What are we doing ? ' ' I ' d say to lemming Phil , my friend. // ' ' Can ' t stop to talk , ' ' he said , pushing his gear up another pass. // ' ' And when we get there ? ' ' I asked // ' ' We ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' // ' ' Let ' s do it next time on motorcycles , ' ' Phil said , at the table , as we plan the evening ' s detour south to look into Lapland. // I thought , no . Motorcycles would sink , fall on us in the water , no getting out to Valhalla . My exhaustion and the light had made me believe my daydream. // ' ' A Mercedes , ' ' I said. // He laughs . We ' ve been edged off the road and hit by gravel from racing tourists , on the main north-south route , sometimes single-laned with branches . Once we ' d been spattered with mud so badly we ' d stopped in the high lake country before the nights had completely slipped away. // The youth hostel lady had had mercy on us . After hosing our bikes down and collapsing 24 hours after hot showers , she had us to dinner in the private quarters of the house . She introduced us to her nieces , Synnove and Star. // They were dressed in Norwegian costume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . We rowed around a mountain lake , surrounded by fires along the shores . We were tired and pulled easy on the carved oars and laughed joyfully at the girl ' s mispronounced literary English. // ' ' He vas en eld mann , end vent many days vidout taking a fish . . . . ' ' We were playing famous first lines of books they had read in English . We walked them home through leafy silent woods to their summer hut . We talked about them often , on the road . Until the midnight sun became an afterburner for our fierce goal to get there. // ' ' Fourteen more days and it will be night again , ' ' Phil had been counting our days . He , too , had the embedded dazzle of no nights in his mind . Then , he had meant eight to the cape . Four down in the boat to Bergen . Two into the dark calming of night again in British waters. // ' ' You ' ll long for these lengthy days , at 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I reminded him. // We left our campsite bags in our room at Alta ( first room since Midsummer ' s ) and biked out of Alta and turned south . There we crossed railroad tracks , puzzled as to where they came from . Norway ' s railroad , which we had followed and waved to trains , ended 200 miles ago. // ' ' From Russia , ' ' said my friend , guessing. // ' ' Yup , ' ' I said , agreeing now with anything that coincides with my romantic vision of the trip. // Twenty miles down a road that looks like any other we ' ve been on , empty , winding through mountains , the shadows of eternal evening across it from sweet pines - why should it look different ? Because the road sign says ' ' Kautokeino , ' ' the center of the Lapp kingdom itself ? // Suddenly , I have an attack of homesickness. // Homesickness ? I feel like Huck Finn in his low times , when he ' s isolated on an island , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for dinner. // It must be my lightheadedness and tiredness . My imagination ' s been working overtime , without sleep , like a man in love . I am in love , I know it . I ' m in love with the muse of the Scandinavian peninsula , with its soft and watery valleys , its hard high rock , with its legends of field and brook. // I feel lonely . I am tired tonight of the long wooing of a country on thin rubber wheels . This muse is an exacting and beautiful princess . She demands rugged action ; but also poetic patience . We have not been patient . We ' ve been too eager to seek her , too fast . What to do ? It ' s too late to slow down. // At 25 miles south , we stop . It was the edge of forest before the greatest wild river valley I had ever seen . Lapland . Eighty or more miles in front of us were low mountains darkened momentarily by evening clouds and coming up from them is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meadows of lichen , rock , and wild grass. // I knew then why I felt homesick . Here , it seemed , was the beginning of everything . The top of the world . The valley in gold evening light was an indescribable home to my spirit . It was the homeland of an intelligent living nomadic people . I wanted to go with them . . . throw down my bicycle and walk into it . . . // Back at the restaurant and rooms , the desk lady had sorted through a bag of mail that had come with the seaplane we ' d seen in the harbor . There was a letter for us with Norwegian stamps . It was from the girls of the lake . Synnove , who was ' ' mine , ' ' with braids banded to soft brunette brushes , who had read ' ' The Old Man and the Sea , ' ' wrote in block runic-like letters : // WE SHALL COME ON THE SHIP TO HONINGSVAG TO GREET YOU ON YOUR SUCCESS TO NORDKAPP . WE SHALL BE THERE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three days away . We had coffee ; paid for our room . The lemmings were off. // On the way up that night , we met a boy from northern Sweden , with his sleeping bag , no fancy gears like ours , straight handlebars , on the lonely road north . He was merrily biking along at 3 a. m. // Where else could a fellow lemming be going at such a time of night ? He joined up with our pack. // Here now was proof that roads from here on led to that last cliff over the sea . I looked at him , tall , strong , a blond crew cut . I didn ' t need to wonder what he ' d done to deserve the sea-ride out to Valhalla . Would there be a girl waiting there for him too ? // //
