Falklands Battle <P> To the Editors : <P> Latin American leaders who are condemning the U.S. for its actions are missing the point June 7 . U.S. foreign policy is not anti-Argentina or anti-Latin America , but rather anti-aggression . If Britain had invaded Buenos Aires , our Government would have undoubtedly sided with Argentina . <P> Michael Gunin <P> Dallas <P> Secretary of State Haig should have gone immediately to the Organization of American States and pleaded that Argentina is wrong . Even if the members disagreed , they would have respected us for coming to them first . <P> Mike J. Mousseau <P> Plattsburgh , N. Y. <P> The U.S. should not forget that in an East-West conflict , its important allies will be the South Americans . The Europeans , with or without missiles , will probably last a few days , while North and South America will be the real fortress for the Western world . <P> Egon Strauss <P> Buenos Aires <P> The British government knows very well that we are its greatest ally . Nevertheless , they put us to the test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a backing that Britain almost certainly could have done without . Consequently , we ruined our delicate relationship with Latin America . In the struggle against Soviet expansionism , a strong U.S.-Latin American bond is as important to Great Britain as it is to us . <P> Anthony Schiano <P> Old Bridge , N.J. <P> Latin Americans were not stunned when Argentina refused to take part in the U.S. grain embargo against the U.S.S.R. , thereby leaving us holding the bag-alone . They have also not been upset when two of their countries threw in their lots with OPEC , which put the screws on us . <P> They are all smiles when they stand at our door with their hands out , only later to raise those hands , clutching American arms , against us . The whole world knows the sympathies expressed by Argentina during World War II . <P> A doublecross ? Turnabout is fair play . <P> John Turner <P> Chicago <P> The Argentine junta claims it is fighting colonialism . In this instance it is the Argentines who are the colonialists .

Whorton <P> New Llano , La . <P> Peripatetic Pope <P> As an Eastern Orthodox Christian , I believe that unity among Christians is impossible in the context of events as presented in " A Pope on British Soil " June 7 . Reunion can occur only when the Pope acknowledges he is equal to all of his brother bishops and can not act against their wishes . The Pope does not have the universal right to rule . Christ alone is the head of the church . The Orthodox Church will accept no other answer . <P> Daniel J. Gorham , Editor <P> Axios <P> Los Angeles <P> Why is it that discussions of Christian reunification are always considered from the perspective of bringing the stray denominations back into the fold of Roman Catholicism ? In the opinion of the world 's 133 million Eastern Orthodox , this is unrealistic . The Orthodox have strayed the least from the doctrine established by the disciples of Christ . <P> Paul M.
