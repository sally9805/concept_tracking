Dan Quisenberry , whose amusements are ordinarily more cerebral , was busily squirting champagne on his teammates last Saturday night in baseball 's time-honored , if idiotic , victory ritual , when suddenly he began shouting at the top of his lungs , " It 's not that easy , dammit ! It 's not that easy ! " Quisenberry might well have been referring to the difficulty he was having finding stationary targets for his bubbly salvos , or maybe he was complaining about recalcitrant corks . Who knows ? But what he really seemed to be doing , if inadvertently , was summing up his Kansas City Royals ' crazy , glorious week , a week that , for all of its successes , had n't been easy . // Quisenberry , the ace reliever who prefers saves to wins , had just won the game  --  5-4 over Oakland  --  that had given the Royals their second straight American League West championship , their sixth in the last 10 years . He had had to go three innings , eight through 10 , to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had n't been easy because K.C. had to come back from four runs behind , something it had n't been able to do all year . A Willie Wilson single up the middle off Oakland reliever Jay Howell 's frantically upraised glove had completed the comeback , scoring Pat Sheridan from third . And when Wilson realized his ricochet had made its way through the infield , he raised his arms high in weary triumph . // The Royals now would take their crack pitching staff and their siege gun , George Brett , to do battle with Toronto for the pennant , and Brett and the chuckers might turn out to be enough . They certainly were last week . // The Royals were one game back of California when the Angels came to Kansas City on Sept. 30 for a showdown four-game series . The Angels had either been in the lead or tied for it for 142 days , and they had marshaled their most effective starters  --  John Candelaria , Mike Witt , Ron Romanick and the lordly Don Sutton  --  for this final challenge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three lefthanders ( Charlie Leibrandt , Bud Black and Danny Jackson ) Royals manager Dick Howser would be starting . Mauch , hoping for his first trip to the World Series in 24 years of managing , ruefully confessed later that he had chuckled to himself at the thought of the lefties trying to get Brian Downing , Doug DeCinces and Bobby Grich out . " A man , " he said , " should know better than to chuckle to himself . " // But it was a righthander , Bret Saberhagen , who nailed the Angels in the series opener 3-1 , pitching a five-hitter and striking out 10 for his 20th win of the season . Saberhagen became the fifth-youngest pitcher , at 21 years , five months and 19 days , in major league history to win 20 games , passing Babe Ruth on the list . " Was Ruth really a better pitcher than a hitter at 21 ? " the new wunderkind asked incredulously . Saberhagen was accurately zipping a 93-mile-an-hour fastball on the corners of the plate all night . He walked only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ninth . That miscalculation brought to the plate Mr. October himself , Reggie Jackson . But it was two hours and 14 minutes before Oct. 1 , so Jackson whiffed on three pitches . // The series opener also gave the Angels the ominous feeling that Brett , who had hit only .210 for the first 28 days of September ( " the worst month of my career " ) , was back on his stick . Leading off the fourth , Brett hit a tremendous home run off the WDAF-TV sign under the waterfall in rightfield . Brett had taken early batting practice , and whatever had been missing from his swing miraculously returned . He was so encouraged that he was out early again the next day helping " coach " the K.C. pitchers , who were taking their first practice swings of the year in case they should get to the Series , which has no DH this year . " Top hand , Dan , top hand , " he bellowed at a quizzical Quisenberry. // But Brett had only one measly single that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , appeared to have been a mismatch . Witt had not gotten past the fourth inning in his previous two starts , while Leibrandt had been Pitcher of the Month for September  --  Mr. September ?  --  when he had won four games , with an 0.91 ERA . The Angels were back on top . // It was an apparent mismatch the other way round on Wednesday , when California 's Ron Romanick ( 14-8 ) faced Black , the mystery man of the Royals ' staff . Black had won 17 games in ' 84 , and he , not the beardless Saberhagen , was to have been the ace in ' 85 . He started well enough , 5-3 through May 26 , but then he lost seven in a row and 12 of 16 decisions . His ERA for his last five starts had been 6.58 . But Howser had stayed with him . " If you can handle it , I can , " he told the pitcher . Black handled the Angels with dispatch , shutting them out 4-0 and tying the two teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Three of the K.C. runs were scored on another Brett homer , this one about 200 feet shorter than the last . // In the first inning , with Lonnie Smith and Wilson on base , Brett hit a soft but sinking liner near the foul line in right . The Angels ' Juan Beniquez gave fervent chase , diving for the ball and missing it completely . On the Royals ' rubbery surface , one must pay for such misplaced aggressiveness . The ball bounced swiftly to the fence as Brett chased Smith and Wilson home , sliding under the relay throw . " I 've seen enough of those inside-the-park homers in Kansas City , " said Brett , " to know you 've got a chance when the ball gets by somebody . " // Mauch , who had been uncommonly cheerful the day before , was beginning to wonder by now if his hitters had any chance against these rejuvenated K.C. starters . " I know they 're good , " he said , shaking his head sadly , " but the celestial All-Stars could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luminaries as Christy Mathewson , Walter Johnson , Mordecai ( Three Finger ) Brown , Grover Cleveland Alexander and Cy Young . Instead , it was Danny Jackson who next faced the Angels , and he beat them 4-1 , with a little help from Quisenberry in the ninth and Wilson in the eighth . Wilson took a triple away from DeCinces with two runners on when he flagged down his long line drive on the warning track in deepest centerfield  --  his momentum after the catch carried him halfway up the wall . Sutton , in quest of his 296th career win , was the loser in his last start of the year . All the Royals ' runs were scored on homers  --  a two-run shot by White and solos by Steve Balboni and , of course , Brett . This was one of Brett 's more conventional blasts , a skyscraper that easily cleared the 410-foot centerfield fence . // The A 's came to town Friday , and Brett 's next homer stayed inside the fences as rookie leftfielder Jose Canseco pulled a Beniquez . Brett conceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspenseful , he personally prefers " the other kind . " Brett would finish his sensational week with nine hits in 20 at bats , five homers of all sorts and 11 RBIs . By winning Friday , the Royals clinched at least a tie for the division title , because Texas had beaten the Angels 6-0 . But there was no celebrating in the K.C. clubhouse yet . The Angels would meet the Rangers the next afternoon , while the A 's and the Royals waited until nightfall . " If the Angels lose , " quipped Saberhagen , " we come to the park drunk . " // But the Angels won , and now the Royals faced the sobering thought that if they did n't win at least one of their final two games , a one-game playoff with California might decide the championship . That prospect looked real enough when the A 's moved to a 4-0 lead by the sixth inning . But Brett  --  who else ?  --  hit a two-run homer in the sixth , and run-scoring singles by White and Balboni tied it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winner , his jubilant teammates clambered out of the dugout to engulf him . " We 're not a dominating team . " said Howser after this squeaker . " We do n't punish people . " They do n't do it the easy way , in other words . But they do get it done .
