But with the relative political influence of the states and more than $30 billion of Federal grants at issue , the maneuvering is well under way . More than 27 months before the actual tally begins , furious skirmishing has broken out over such things as whether official adjustments should be made to offset the inclusion of illegal aliens and the inevitable undercount of black and Hispanic residents. // A top Census Bureau statistician , Barbara A. Bailar , abruptly resigned this month amid speculation that she thought the Reagan Administration was politically motivated in a decision last fall not to adjust the 1990 census in such ways. // Moreover , the divisive decennial scrap over the number of representatives the various states send to Congress has prompted fresh debate about the stunningly complex methodology employed just to allocate seats in the House . <> <> New Estimates Awaited // " There ' s much more awareness of the impact of the census this time around , " said a Commerce Department spokesman , Maury Cagle , referring particularly to the proliferation of computer runs that seek to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the 1990 count . The Census Bureau is a part of the Commerce Department. // On Wednesday the Census Bureau will issue population estimates for the states as of mid-1987 , thereby touching off a new round of projections affecting seat-apportionment for the 1990 ' s . New York , as well as Massachusetts and Pennsylvania , are among the states closest to the cutting edge. // " There ' s no question , New York ' s going to lose seats , " observed TerriAnn Lowenthal , staff director of a House subcommittee on census and population . " The question is how many . " Projections suggest that New York will most likely lose three or four representatives , but it might hold the loss to two , especially if legislation favorable to the state is passed. // The bill , introduced in the Senate this month by Daniel Patrick Moynihan , Democrat of New York , would require the Government to make a statistical correction for what is said to be a historic undercount of minorities , the homeless and the rural poor .

Representative Barbara B. Kennelly , a Democrat , and other members of the state ' s delegation have offered a bill to exclude illegal aliens from the census count while including military personnel and their families stationed abroad. // " Counting illegal aliens favors the larger states , even though illegal aliens can not vote and are very difficult to count , " Mrs. Kennelly declared .

The most recent serious challenge was mounted by Indiana as it sought , unsuccessfully , in 1981 to prevent the loss of one of its 11 seats. // Under the Constitution , each state is entitled to at least one representative as well as two senators . The problem , rarely appreciated by nonprofessionals , is the mathematical and political difficulty of allocating the remaining 385 House seats. // In 1792 , under a plan named for Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , each state got one representative for every 33 , 000 people and the fractional populations left over were simply disregarded .

With more states joining the Union and the general population growing , it seemed the House membership would soon be unwieldy. // So in 1850 , the House size became relatively fixed , with the 51st and subsequent seats awarded by the highest fraction until a quota of 233 seats was filled . But this gave rise to a paradox noticed after the census of 1880 , in which a state would actually lose a seat if the size of the House were increased and the population of all states remained unchanged . <> <> Method of Equal Proportions // After more tinkering at the beginning of the 20th century - for example , total membership was fixed at 435 - Congress acted in 1941 to adopt the present system , known as the method of equal proportions .

Ericksen of Temple University , four political powerhouses - New York , Pennsylvania , Ohio and Michigan - will lose as many as 13 of their 96 seats in the forthcoming census. // As a small army of academic and special-interest analysts set to work crunching the updated population estimates to be released Wednesday , the many issues related to the 1990 census are likely to become increasingly visible , partly because of the simple fact of computer proliferation in the past decade. // " Practically anybody , " observed David C. Huckabee , an expert at the Congressional Research Service , " can do an apportionment now. " //
