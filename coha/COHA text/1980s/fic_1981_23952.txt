ORPHANS A story by Marilynne Robinson Our family was somewhat prominent in Fingerbone , because my grand father had died in a derailment , the spectacular slide of a train into the lake , which had been reported in newspapers as far east as St. Paul . And the family became , in a sense , more prominent still when my mother left my sister Lucille and me , with our clothes and a box of graham crackers , on the porch of our grandmother 's house , and sailed her borrowed Ford into the lake , for reasons that were never clear . But after our grandmother died , when our aunt Sylvie came to look after us , our family , or what remained of it , began to seem not so much prominent as conspicuous . When Sylvie had hardly been with us a month , there was already talk . And though it was true that Sylvie did not have the habit of housekeeping , or any gift for it , and that under her care we lived with little in the way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was when Lucille left us to live with another family in town . " Well , you and I will be better friends , " Sylvie said . She smiled . " 1 have something pretty to show you . A place I found . It 's really very pretty . There 's a little valley between two hills where someone built a house and planted an orchard and even started to dig a well . A long time ago . But the valley is very narrow , and it runs north and south , so it hardly gets any sun at all . The frost stays on the ground all day long , up until July . Some of the apple trees are alive , but they 're only as high as my shoulder . If we go there now it will be all covered with frost . The frost is so thick that the grass cracks when you step on it . " " Where is it ? " " North . I found a little boat . I do n't really think it belongs to anybody . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leak very much or anything like that . " " I 'd like to go . " " Tomorrow ? " " No . I have school tomorrow . " " I 'll write you an excuse . " YLVIE MADE up a lunch that night after supper and we set the alarm clock for five and went to sleep early , with our clothes on . Nevertheless , Sylvie had to tease me awake . She pinched my cheek and pulled my ear . Then she set my feet on the floor and pulled me up by the hands . I sat down on the bed again and fell over onto the pillow , and she laughed . " Get up ! " " In a minute . " " Now ! Breakfast is ready ! " I crouched on the covers , hoarding warmth and sleep , while they passed off me like a mist . " Wake up , wake up , wake up , " Sylvie said . She picked up my hand , patted it , toyed with my fingers . When I was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good girl , " Sylvie said . The room was dark . When Sylvie put the light on , it still seemed sullen and full of sleep . There were cries of birds , sharp and rudimentary , that stung like sparks or hail . And even in the house I could smell how raw the wind was . That sort of wind brought out a musk in the fir trees and spread the cold breath of the lake everywhere . There was nothing out there  --  no smell of wood smoke or oatmeal ? to hint at human comfort , and when I went outside I would be miserable . It was almost November and long before dawn , and I did not want to leave my bed . " Come , Ruthie , " Sylvie said , and pulled me by both hands toward the door . " Do we have to hurry ? " " Yes . Yes . We have to hurry . " She opened the trapdoor and went down the stairs ahead of me , still pulling me by one hand . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frying pan and set it on a piece of bread . " There 's your breakfast , " she said . " You can eat it while we walk . " " I have to tie my shoes , " I said to her back as she walked out to the porch . " Wait ! " but the screen door slammed behind her . I tied my shoes and found my coat and pulled it on , and ran out the door after her . The grass was blue with frost . The road was so cold it rang as I stepped on it , and the houses and trees and sky were one flat black . A bird sang with a sound like someone scraping a pot , and was silent . I had given up all sensation to the discomforts of cold and haste and hunger , and crouched far inside myself , still sleeping . Finally , Sylvie was in front of me , and I put my hands in my pockets , and tilted my head , and strode , as she did , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her only because she moved and not because I willed this pace , this pocketing of the hands , this tilt of the head . Following her required neither will nor effort . I did it in my sleep . I walked after Sylvie down the shore , all at peace , and at ease , and I thought , We are the same . She could as well be my mother . I crouched and slept in her very shape like an unborn child . " Wait here , " Sylvie said when we came to the shore . She walked down to a place where trees grew near the water . After a few minutes she came back . " The boat is not where I left it ! " she said . " Well , we 'll have to look for it . I 'll find it . Sometimes it takes a while , but I always find it . " She climbed up onto a rock that stood out from the hillside almost to the water , and looked up and down the shore . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rock and began walking south . " See those trees ? I found it once before , in a place just like that , all covered with branches . " " Someone was trying to hide it , " I suggested . " Can you imagine ? I always put it right back where I find it . I do n't care if someone else uses it . You know , so long as they do n't damage it . " W E WALKED down to where a stand of birch and aspen trees sheltered a little inlet . " This would be a perfect place for it , " Sylvie said , but it was not there . " Do n't be discouraged , " she said . " We 're so early . No one could have got to it first . Wait . " She walked up into the woods . Behind a fallen log , and behind a clump of fat , low-growing pines , was a heap of pine boughs with poplar branches and brown needles and leaves . Here and there an edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Sylvie said . " Someone went to a tot of trouble . " She kicked away the branches until on one side the tarpaulin and the shape of the rowboat were exposed . Then she lifted the side of the boat until it fell over upright on the heap of branches . She pulled at the tarpaulin that had been spread under the boat until she found the oars . She stuck them under the seat . The boat made a thick , warm sound as we pushed it through the pine needles . It scraped dully across some big rocks , then dragged through the sand . We pushed it into the water . " Get in , " Sylvie said . " Hurry . " I climbed in and sat down on a narrow . splintery plank , facing the shore . " There 's a man yelling at us , " I said . " Oh . I know ! " Sylvie pushed the boat out in two long strides , and then , with a hand on each gunwale , half leaped and half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I have to sit in that seat , " she said . She stood up and turned around and stooped to hold the gunwales , and I crawled under her body and out between her legs . A stone splashed the water inches from my face , and another rattled into the bottom of the boat . Sylvie swung an oar over my head , settled it into the lock , crouched , and pulled us strongly away from the shore . A stone flew past my arm . I looked back and saw a burly man in knee boots and black pants and a red plaid jacket . I could see that he was wearing one of those shapeless felt hats that fishermen there decorate with small gleams and plumes and violent hooks . His voice was full of rage . " Just ignore him , " 60 Sylvie said . She pulled again , and we were beyond reach . The man had followed us into the water until he was up to his boot tops in it . " Lady ! " he bawled . " Ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . If he thinks someone 's watching him , he just carries on more . " I turned around and watched Sylvie . Her handling of the boat was strong and easy . When we were about one hundred yards from the shore she turned the boat toward the north . The man , now back on the beach , was still yelling and dancing his wrath and pitching stones after us . " It 's pitiful , " Sylvie said . " He 's going to have a heart attack someday . " " It must be his boat , " I suggested . Sylvie shrugged . " Or he might just be some sort of lunatic , " she said . " I 'm certainly not going to go back and find out . " She was unperturbed by our bare escape and by her drenched loafers and the soggy skirts of her coat . I found myself wondering if this was why she came home with fish in her pockets . " Are n't you cold , Sylvie ? " " The sun 's coming up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floral yellow . A few spindled clouds smoldered and glowed a mostunfiery pink . And then the sun flung a long shaft over the mountain , and another , like a long-legged insect bracing itself out of its chrysalis , and then it showed above the black crest , bristly and red and improbable . In an hour it would be the ordinary sun , spreading modest and impersonal light on an ordinary world , and that thought relieved me . Sylvie continued to pull , strongly and slowly . " You would n't believe how many people live out here on the islands and up in the hills , " Sylvie said . " I bet there are a hundred . Or more . Sometimes you 'll see a little smoke in the woods . There might be a cabin there with ten children in it . " " They just hunt and fish ? " " Mostly . " " Have you ever seen any of them ? " " I think I have , " Sylvie said . " Sometimes if I think I see smoke I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure there are children around me . I can practically hear them . " " Oh . " " That 's one reason I keep crackers in my pockets . " " I see . " Sylvie rowed on through the gilded water , smiling to herself . " I 'll tell you something . You 'll probably think I 'm crazy . I tried to catch one once . " She laughed . " Not , you know , trap it , but lure it out with marshmallows so I could see it . What would I do with another child ? " " So you did see someone . " " I just stuck marshmallows on the twigs of one of the apple trees , almost every day for a cauple of weeks . Then I sat sort of out of sight there 's still a doorstep there with lilacs growing on both sides of it . The house itself fell into the cellar hole years ago , of course . I just sat there and waited , but it never came . I was a little bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might claw or bite . But I did want to look at it . " " This was at the place we 're going to now . " Sylvie smiled and nodded . " Now you 're in on my secret . Maybe you 'll have better luck . And at least we do n't have to hurry . It was so hard to get home in time for you and Lucille . " S YLVIE PULLED and then pulled , and we slid heavily through the slosh and jostle of the water . Sylvie looked at the sky and said no more . I peered over the side now and then , into the murky transparencies of the upper waters , which were clouded and crude as agate . I saw gulls ' feathers and the black shapes of fish . The fragmented image of jonquil sky spilled from top to top of the rounding waves as the shine spills on silk , and gulls sailed up into the very height of the sky , still stark white when they could just be seen . To the east the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balmy light . Dawn and its excesses always reminded me of heaven , a place where I have always known I would not be comfortable . They reminded me of my grandfather 's paintings , which I have always taken to be his vision of heaven . And it was he who brought us here , to this bitter , moon-pulled lake , trailing us after him unborn , like the cherubs he had painted on the dresser drawers , whose garments swam in some ethereal current , perhaps the rim of the vortex that would drag them down out of that enameled sky , stripped and screaming . Sylvie 's oars set off vortices . She swamped some leaves and spun a feather on its curl . The current that made us sidle a little toward the center of the lake was the draw of the river , and no vortex , though my grandfather 's last migration had settled him on the lake floor . It seemed that Sylvie 's boat slipped down the west side of every wave . We would make a circle , and never reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , and we would be drawn down into the darker world , where othersounds would pour into our ears until we seemed to find songs in them , and the sight of water would invade our eyes , and the taste of water would invade our bowels and unstring our bones , and we would know the seasons and customs of the place as if there were no others . Imagine my grandfather reclined how many years in his Pullman berth , regarding the morning through a small blue window . lie might see us and think he was dreaming again of flushed but weightless spirits in a painted sky , buoyant in an impalpable element . And when our shadow had passed he might see the daylit moon , a jawless , socketed shard , and take it for his image in the glass . Of course he was miles away , miles south , at the foot of the bridge . At last she pulled us toward a broad point that lay out into the lake . I could see that the mountain standing behind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken side . Stone showed pink as a scar on a dog 's ear . " You can see where it is from here , " Sylvie said . " They built right beside those cliffs . " She brought us up against the shore and we climbed out of the boat and dragged it up on the beach . I followed Sylvie inland along the side of the point . The mountains that walled the valley were too close , the one upon the other . The rampages of glaciers in their eons of slow violence had left the landscape in a great disorder . Out from the cleft or valley the mountains made spilled a lap of spongy earth , overgrown with brush . We walked up it along the deep , pebbly bed left by the run-off and the rain , and there we came upon the place Sylvie had told me about , stunted orchard and lilacs and stone doorstep and fallen house , all white with a brine of frost . Sylvie smiled at me . " Pretty , is n't it ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have wanted to live here . " " It 's really pretty in the sunlight . You 'll see in a little while . " " Well , let 's not wait here , though . It 's too cold . " Sylvie glanced at me , a little surprised . " But you 'll want to watch for the children . " " Yes . All right . " " Well , I think you better just stay in one place and be very quiet . " " Yes , but it 's too cold here . " Sylvie shrugged . " It 's still early . " We walked back down to the shore , and found some rocks against which we could sit , out of the wind , facing the sun . Sylvie crossed her ankles and folded her arms . She appeared to fall asleep . After a while I said , " Sylvie ? " She smiled . " Shhh. " 62 " Where 's our lunch ? " " Still in the boat . You 're probably right . It would be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag of marshmallows among the odds and ends that Sylvie had bundled into a checkered tablecloth and brought along for lunch  --  a black banana , a lump of salami with a knife through it , a single yellow chicken wing like an elegant , small gesture of defeat , the bottom fifth of a bag of potato chips . I ripped the cellophane and took out marshmallows to fill my pockets . Then I sat down by Sylvie and made a small fire of driftwood and skewered one through its soft belly with a stick and held it in the flame until it caught fire . 1 let it burn until it was as black as a lump of coal , then I pulled off the weightless husk with my fingers and ate it , and held the creamy part that still clung to the stick in the flame until it caught fire ; and so the morning passed . S YLVIE STOOD up and stretched , and nodded at the sun , which was a small , white , wintry sun and stood askant the zenith although it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . I followed her up into the valley again and found it much changed . It was as if the light had coaxed a flowering from the frost , which before seemed barren and parched as salt . The grass shone with petal colors , and water drops spilled from all the trees as innumerably as petals . " I told you it was nice , " Sylvie said . Imagine a Carthage sown with salt . and all the sowers gone , and the seeds lain however long in the earth , till there rose finally in vegetable profusion leaves and trees of rime and brine . What flowering would there be in such a garden ? Light would force each salt calyx to open in prisms , and to fruit heavily with bright globes of water  --  peaches and grapes are little more than that , and where the world was salt there would be greater need of slaking . For need can blossom into all the compensations it requires . To crave and to have are as like as a thing and its shadow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweetly as when one longs to taste it , and when is the taste refracted into so many hues and savors of ripeness and earth , and when do our senses know any thing so utterly as when we lack it ? And here again is a foreshadowing  --  the world will be made whole . For to wish for a hand on one 's hair is all but to feel it . So whatever we may lose , very craving gives it back to us again . Though we dream and hardly know it , longing , like an angel , fosters us , smooths our hair , and brings us wild huckleberries . Sylvie was gone . She had left without a word , or a sound . I thought she must be teasing , perhaps watching me from the woods . I pretended not to know I was alone . I could see why Sylvie thought children might come here . Any child who saw once how the gleaming water spilled to the tips of branches , and rounded and dropped and pocked the softening shadows of frost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see it again . If there had been snow 1 would have made a statue , a woman to stand along the path , among the trees . The children would have come close , to look at her . Lot 's wife was salt and barren , because she was full of loss and mourning , and looked back . But here rare flowers would gleam in her hair , and on her breast , and in her hands , and there would be children all around her , to love and marvel at her for her beauty , and to laugh at her extravagant adornments , as if they had set the flowers in her hair and thrown down all the flowers at her feet , and they would forgive her , eagerly and lavishly , for turning away , though she never asked to be forgiven . Though her hands were ice and did not touch them , she would be more than mother to them , she so calm , so still , and they such wild and orphan things . I WALKED OUT of the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The shore was empty and , after its manner , silent . Sylvie must be up at the point , I thought . I imagined her hiding the boat more securely . That would be a reasonable precaution for her to take . convinced as she was that these woods were peopled . 1 sat on a log and whistled and tossed stones at the toe of my shoe . I knew why Sylvie felt there were children in the woods . I felt so , too . though I did not think so . I sat on the log , pelting my shoe , because I knew that if I turned however quickly to look behind me the consciousness behind me would not still be there , and would only come closer when I turned away again . Even if it spoke just at my ear , as it seemed often at the point of doing , when I turned there would be nothing there . In that way it was persistent and teasing and ungentle , the way half-wild , lonely children are . This was something rny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been avoiding the shore all that fall , because when I was by myself and obviously lonely , too , the teasing would be much more difficult to disregard . Having a sister or a friend is like sitting at night in a lighted house . Those outside can watch you if they want , but you need not see them . You simply say , " Here and thoroughly used to the cold , and it was almost a joke to them to be cast out into the woods , even if their eyes were gone and their feet were broken . It is better to have nothing , for at last even our bones will fall . It is better to have nothing . I sat down on the grass , which was stiff with the cold , and I put my hands over my face , and 1 let my skin tighten , and let the chills run in ripples , like breezy water , between my shoulder blades and up my neck . I let the numbing grass touch my ankles . I thought , Sylvie is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , Let them come unhouse me of this flesh , and pry this house apart . It was no shelter now , it only kept me here alone , and I would rather be with them , if only to see them , even if they turned away from me . If I could see my mother , it would not have to be her eyes , her hair . I would not need to touch her sleeve . There was no more the stoop of her high shoulders . The lake had taken that , I knew . It was so very long since the dark had swum her hair , and there was nothing more to dream of , but often she almost slipped through any door I saw from the side of my eye , and it was she , and not changed , and not perished . She was a music I no longer heard , that rang in my mind , itself and nothing else , lost to all sense , but not perished , not perished . s YLVIE PUT HER hand on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I had not noticed . She looked into my face and said nothing at all . She opened her coat and closed it around me , bundling me awkwardly against her so that my cheekbone pillowed on her breastbone . She swayed us to some slow song she did not sing , and I stayed very still against her and hid the awkwardness and discomfort so that she would continue to hold me and sway . For some reason the inside of Sylvie 's coat smelled of camphor . The smell was pleasant enough , like cedar pitch or incense , curative and elegiac . Her dress was of a staunch , dry-textured cotton , and over it she wore an orlon sweater . The dress was surely brown or green , the sweater pink or yellow , but I could not see . I crouched low enough so that Sylvie 's coat prevented even the seep of light through my eyelids . I said , " I did n't see them . I could n't see them . " " I know , I know , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know . I know , I know . She crooned , " Another time , another time . " When we got up to leave , Sylvie slipped her coat off and put it on me . She buttoned it up , bottom to top , and pulled the wide man 's collar up around my ears , and then she put her arms around my shoulders and led me down to the shore with such solicitude , as if 1 were blind , as if I might fall . I could feel the pleasure she took in my dependency , and more than once she stooped to look into my face . Her expression was intent and absorbed . There was nothing of distance or civility in it . It was as if she were studying her own face in a mirror . I was angry that she had left me for so long , and that she did not ask pardon or explain , and that by abandoning me she had assumed the power to bestow such a richness of grace . For in fact I wore her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as heartening as mercy , and I would say nothing that might make her loosen her grasp or take one step away . The boat was already in the water , bobbing about at the end of a short rope that Sylvie had weighted down with a stone . She pulled it in and turned it so that I could step over the gunwale without getting my feet wet . It was evening . The sky glowed like a candled egg . The water was a translucent gray , and the waves were as high as they could be without breaking . I lay down on my side in the bottom of the boat , and rested my arms and my head on the splintery plank seat . Sylvie climbed in and settled herself with a foot on either side of me . She twisted around and pushed us off with an oar , and then she began to reach and pull , reach and pull , with a strength that seemed to have no effort in it . I lay like a seed in a husk . The immense water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our survival was owed to our slightness , that we danced through ruinous currents as dry leaves do , and were not capsized because the ruin we rode upon was meant for greater things . 1 toyed with the thought that we might capsize . It was the order of the world , after all , that water should pry through the seams of husks , which , pursed and tight as they might be , are only made for breaching . It was the order of the world that the shell should fall away and that I , the nub , the sleeping germ , should swell and expand . Say that water lapped over the gunwales , and I swelled and swelled until I burst Sylvie 's coat . Say that the water and I bore the rowboat down to the bottom , and I , miraculously , monstrously , drank water into all my pores until the last black cranny of my brain was a trickle , a spillet . And given that it is in the nature of water to fill and force to repletion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would hunch against the sky and my vastness would press my cheek hard and immovably against my knee . Then , presumably , would come parturition in some form , though my first birth had hardly deserved that name , and why should 1 hope for more from the second ? The only true birth would be a final one , which would free us from watery darkness and the thought of watery darkness , but could such a birth be imagined ? What is thought , after all , what is dreaming , but swim and flow , and the images they seem to animate ? The images are the worst of it . It would be terrible to stand outside in the dark and watch a woman in a lighted room studying her face in a window , and to throw a stone at her , shattering the glass , and then to watch the window knit itself up again and the bright bits of lip and throat and hair piece themselves seamlessly again into that unknown , indifferent woman . It would be terrible to see a shattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . And here we find our great affinity with water , for like reflections on water our thoughts will suffer no changing shock , no permanent displacement . They mock us with their seeming slightness . If they were more substantial  --  if they had weight and took up space  --  they would sink or be carried away in the general flux . But they persist , outside the brisk and ruinous energies of the world . I think it must have been my mother 's plan to rupture this bright surface , to sail beneath it into very blackness , but here she was , wherever my eyes fell , and behind my eyes , whole and in fragments , a thousand images of one gesture , never dispelled but rising always , inevitably , like a drowned woman . I slept between Sylvie 's feet , and under the reach of her arms , and sometimes one of us spoke , and sometimes one of us answered . There was a pool of water under the hollow of my side , and it was almost warm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heels . My neck was stiff and my arm and hand were asleep . There was a small , sparse scattering of lights on the shore , which was still at a considerable distance . Sylvie had brought us up to the side of the bridge and was working the oars to keep the current from carrying us under it . I knew the bridge well . It began above the shore , some thirty feet from the edge of the water . I knew the look of its rusted bolts and tarred pilings . The structure was crude , seen from close up , though from any distance its length and the vastness of the lake made it seem fragile and attenuated . Now , in the moonlight , it loomed above us and was very black , as black as charred wood . Of course , among all these pilings and girders the waves slipped and slapped and trickled , insistent , intimate , insinuating , proprietary as rodents in a dark house . Sylvie pulled us a few feet out from the bridge and then we rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvie ? " I asked . " Waiting for the train , " she said . If I had asked why we were waiting for the train she would have said , To see it . or she would have said , Why not , or , Since we are here anyway , we might as well watch it go by . Our little boat bobbed and wobbled , and I was appalled by the sheer liquidity of the water beneath us . If I stepped over the side , where would my foot rest ? Water is almost nothing , after all . It is conspicuously different from air only in its tendency to flood and founder and drown , and even that difference may be relative rather than absolute . S 1'LV1E PULLED the boat some distance from the bridge . ' ' It should n't be long now , " she said . The moon was bright , but it was behind her , so I could not see her face . There was so much moonlight that it dulled the stars , and there was a slick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could see . In the moonlight the boat was the color of driftwood , just as it was by day . The tarred bridge was blacker than it was by daylight , but only a little . The light made a sort of nimbus around Sylvie . I could see her hair , though not the color of her hair , and her shoulders , and the outline of her arms , and the oars , which continually troubled fragments of achromatic and imageless light . The lights of Fingerbone had begun to go out , but they had added nothing to the sum of light and could subtract nothing from it . " How much longer ? " I asked . Sylvie said , " Hmninim ? " " How much longer ? " Sylvie did not reply . So I sat very quietly , drawing her coat around myself . She began to hum " Irene , " so I began to hum it , too . Finally she said , " We 'll hear it before we see it . The bridge will tremble . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Irene . " Between darkness and water the wind was as sour as a coin , and I wished utterly to be elsewhere , and that and the moonlight made the world seem very broad . Sylvie had no awareness of time . For her . hours and minutes were the names of trains  --  we were waiting for the 9:52 . Sylvie seemed neither patient nor impatient , just as she seemed neither comfortable nor uncomfortable . She was merely quiet , unless she sang , and still , unless she pulled us outward from the bridge . I hated waiting . If I had one particular complaint , it was that my life seemed composed entirely of expectation . I expected ? an arrival , an explanation , an apology . There had never been one , a fact I could have accepted , were it not true that , just when I had got used to the limits and dimensions of one moment , I was expelled into the next and made to wonder again if any shapes hid in its shadows . That most moments were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that the next moment might he utterly different . And so the ordinary demand . ed unblinking attention . Any tedious hour might be the last of its kind . " Sylvie , " I said . She did not answer . And any present moment was only thinking , and thoughts bear the same relation , in mass and weight , to the darkness they rise from . as reflections do to the water they ride upon . and 0 in the same way they are arbitrary , or merely given . Anyone that leans to look into a pool is the woman in the pool , anyone who looks into our eyes is the image in our eyes , and 6 these things are true without argument , and so our thoughts reflect what passes before them . But there are difficulties . For one , the fall of my grandfather 's train into the lake is more vivid in my mind than it would have been if I had seen it ( for the mind 's eye is not utterly baffled by darkness ) , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well be my mother herself as Sylvie . I spoke to her by the name Sylvie . and she did not answer . Then how was one to know ? And if she were Helen in my sight , how could she not be Helen in fact ? " Sylvie ! " I said . She did not reply . We had ridden in against the bridge again , and were almost under it when the girders began to hum . She rested the flat of her hand against a piling . The sound grew louder and louder , and there was a trembling through the whole frame . The whole long bridge was as quick and tense as vertebrae , singing with one alarm , and I could not have known by the sound which direction the train would be coming from . She had rested the oars , and we bobbed farther and farther under the bridge . She folded her arms on her knees and buried her face , and she swayed and swayed and swayed , so that the boat tipped a little . " Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the bridge began to rumble and shake as if it would fall . Shock banged and pounded in every joint . I saw a light pass over my head like a meteor , and then I smelled hot , foul , black oil and heard the gnash of wheels along the rails . It was a very long train . She stood up . The boat wallowed and water spilled in over our feet . She turned to look behind her . I threw my arms around a piling to steady us . The last of the train passed over our heads and sped away . She combed her fingers through her hair and said something inaudible . " What did you say ? " I shouted . " Nothing . " She gestured at the bridge and the water with upturned hands . She stared out at the moonlit lake , smoothing back her hair , and nothing in her posture suggested that she remembered she was in a boat . If she had stepped over the side , and the skirt of her dress had billowed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid through the rifts of moonlight into the wintering lake , I would not have been surprised . " Sylvie , " I said . And she said , " I probably would n't have seen much anyway . They put the lights out so that people can sleep . I was just woolgathering , and all of a sudden it was right there on top of us . And was n't it loud , though . " " I wish you 'd sit down . " Sylvie sat down and took the oars and pulled us away from the bridge again . " The train must be just about under us here , " she said . She leaned over and peered into the water . " Lots of people came in from the hills . It was like the Fourth of July , except that the bunting was black . " Sylvie laughed . She shifted around and peered over the other side . T HE WIND was rising , and the boat sat rather heavily in the water , because we were over our shoes in water I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over the side . Sylvie shook her head . " There is nothing to be afraid of , " she said . " Nothing to be worried about . Nothing at all . " She dipped her hand into the lake and let the water fall from her fingers . " The lake must be full of people , " she said . " I 've heard stories all my life . " After a minute she laughed . " You can bet there were a lot of people on the train nobody knew about . " Her hand trifled with the water as if it were not cold . " I never thought of that as stealing , " she said thoughtfully . " You just find yourself an empty place , out of everyone 's way  --  no harm done . No one even knows you 're there . " She was quiet for a long time . " Everyone rode that train . It was almost new , you know . De luxe . There were chandeliers in the club car . Everyone said they had ridden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had , or their uncles had . It was famous . " She combed and sifted the water with her fingers . " So there must have been a lot of people in the freight cars . Who knows how many All of them sleeping . " She said , " You never know . " I noticed that my feet disappeared from the ankles into a sheet of moonlight . When Sylvie moved or gestured , the light was rumpled and shadows fell over it , but just then she was lying back against the prow , trailing her hand in the water . It occurred to me to wonder whether all this moonlight together , if it could be seen from the necessary altitude , would make an image of the moon , with shadows for the sockets and the mouth . " Are n't you cold , Sylvie ? " I asked . " Do you want to go home ? " " All right . " Sylvie took the oars and began to pull us toward Fingerbone . " I ca n't sleep on a train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do . " The wind was blowing out from the shore , and the current carried us always toward the bridge . She pulled and pulled but , for all I could see , we hardly moved . Fingerbone was extinguished and the bridge pilings were one like another , so I could not be sure . But watching Sylvie seemed very much like dreaming , because the motion was always the same , and was necessary , and arduous , and without issue , and repeated , not as one motion in a series , but as the same motion repeated because here was the mystery , if one could find it . We only seemed to be tethered to the old wreck on the lake floor . It was the wind that made us hover there . It was possible to pass out of the sight of my grandfather 's empty eye , though the effort was dreadful . Sylvie rested the oars and folded her arms , and we bobbed away from the shore again . " Let me try rowing , " I said . Sylvie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her legs . My left arm has always been stronger than my right . For every two strokes with the oars together I had to take a third with the right oar alone , until I abandoned the idea of staying beside the bridge . To follow the bridge was the quickest way home , or it would have been if any progress had been possible , but as it was I let the current carry us under the bridge and toward the south . The wind was steady and the shore was inaccessible . I rested the oars . Sylvie had folded her arms and laid her head on them . I could hear her humming . She said , " I wish 1 had some pancakes . " I said . ' I wish I had a hamburger . " " I wish I had some beef stew . " " I wish I had a piece of pie . " " I wish I had a mink coat . " " I wish I had an electric blanket . " " Do n't sleep , Ruthie . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L " " We 'll sing . " " All right . " " Let 's think of a song . " All right . " We were quiet , listening to the wind . " What a day , " Sylvie said . She laughed . " I used to know a woman who said that all the time . What a day , what a day . She made it sound so sad . " " Where is she now ? " " Who knows ? " Sylvie laughed . The moon was going into eclipse behind a mountain , and the night was turning black . Sylvie had begun to hum to herself a song I did not know , and every moment was like every other , except that sometimes we turned , and sometimes a wave slapped our side , " We could have tied the boat to the bridge , " Sylvie said . " Then we 'd have stayed close to town , and we would n't have gotten lost . " " Why did n't you do that ? " " It does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treetop ' ? " " I do n't feel like singing . " Sylvie patted my knee . " You go to sleep if you want to , " she said . " It wo n't make any difference . " A S IT HAPPENED , as the sun rose we were near the west shore of the lake , and still within sight of the bridge . Sylvie rowed us in , and we beached the boat and climbed up to the highway and walked to the railroad . I dozed on the rocks while Sylvie watched for an eastbound train . A freight came after a long time , and it slowed so cautiously for the bridge that we clambered into a boxcar without much difficulty . It was half full of wooden crates and smelled of oil and straw . There was an old Indian woman sitting in the corner with her knees drawn up and her arms between her knees . Her skin was very dark except for an albino patch on her forehead that gave her a tuft of colorless hair and one white brow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fringed like a piano scarf . She sucked on the fringe and watched us . Sylvie stood in the door , looking out over the lake . " It 's pretty today , " she said . Portly white clouds , bellied like cherubs , sailed across the sky , and the sky and the lake were an elegant azure . One can imagine that , at the apex of the Flood , when the globe was a ball of water , came the day of divine relenting , when Noah 's wife must have opened the shutters upon a morning designed to reflect an enormous good nature . We can imagine that the Deluge rippled and glistened , and that the clouds , under an altered dispensation , were 68 purely ornamental . True , the waters were full of people  --  we knew the story from our childhood . The lady at her window might have wished to be with the mothers and uncles , among the dance of bones , since this is hard . ly a human world , here in the fatuous light , admiring the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the Flood had never ended . If one is lost on the water , any hill is Ararat . And below is always the accumulated past , which vanishes but does not vanish , which perishes and remains . If we imagine that Noah 's wife , when she was old , found somewhere a remnant of the Deluge , she might have walked into it till her widow 's dress floated above her head and the water loosened her plaited hair . And she would have left it to her sons to tell the tedious tale of generations . She was a nameless woman , and so at home among all those who were never found and never missed , who were uncommemorated , whose deaths were not remarked , nor their begettings . The old woman in the corner looked at me sidelong , steadily . She stuck a long finger into her mouth to feel a tooth . Then she said , " She 's gettin ' growed . " Sylvie replied , " She 's a good girl . " " Like you always said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailed above the water rickety click into Fingerbone , and Sylvie and I climbed down in the freight yard . And then we walked home . Our dishevelment was considerable . But the ruin of my clothes was entirely concealed by Sylvie 's coat , which hung beyond my fingertips in the sleeves , and to within an inch of my ankles . Sylvie combed back her hair with her fingers , and then hugged her ribs and assumed an expression of injured dignity . " Do n't mind if they stare , " she said . We walked through town . Sylvie fixed her gaze six inches above eye level , but in fact no one stared , though many people glanced at us , and then glanced a second time . At the drugstore we passed Lucille and her friends , though Sylvie seemed not to notice . Lucille was dressed like all the others in a sweatshirt and sneakers and rolled-up jeans , and she looked after us , her hands stuck in her hip pockets . I thought I should not draw attention to myself , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I simply walked on , as if unaware that she saw me . It was a relief when we came to Sycamore Street , though the dogs all ran off the porches with their ears laid back and barked and nipped at us with a ferocity that I had never seen . " Ignore them , " Sylvie said . She picked up a stone . That seemed to excite them . Peopie came out on their porches and shouted " Here , Jeff , " and " Come on home , Brutus . " but the dogs seemed not to hear . Down the whole length of the street we were encircled by frenzied mongrels who made passes at our ankles . I modeled my indifference on Sylvie's. w HEN WE were at home finally , Sylvie made a fire and we sat by the stove . Sylvie found graham crackers and Cheerios , but we were too tired to eat , so she patted my head and went off to her room to lie down . I was almost asleep , or I was asleep , when Lucille came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did not say anything . She pulled up one foot to retie a sneaker and looked around the kitchen , and then she said , " I wish you 'd take off that coat . " " My clothes are wet . " " You should change your clothes . " I was too tired to move . She brought some wood from the porch and dropped it into the MONT . " It does n't matter , " Lucille said . " Where have you been ? " Now , I would have told Lucille , and I meant to tell her , as soon as I composed my thoughts . I began to say , To the lake , and To the bridge , but I felt warmly that Lucille deserved a better answer . I wished very much , in fact , to tell Lucille exactly where I had been . and it was precisely my sense of the importance of telling her this that put me to sleep . For I dreamed and dreamed that Sylvie and I were drifting in the dark , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew and would not tell me . I dreamed that the bridge was a chute into the lake and that , one after another , handsome trains slid into the water without even troubling the surface . I dreamed that the bridge was the frame of a charred house , and that Sylvie and I were looking for the children who lived there , and though we heard them we could never find them . I dreamed that Sylvie was teaching me to walk under water . To move so slowly needed patience and grace , but she pulled me after her in the slowest waltz , and our clothes flew like the robes of painted angels . It seemed Lucille was talking to me . I think she said that I need not stay with Sylvie . I believe she mentioned my comfort . She was pinching a crease into the loose denim at the knee of her jeans , and her brow was contracted and her eyes were calm , and I am sure that she spoke to me in all sober kindness , but I could not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
