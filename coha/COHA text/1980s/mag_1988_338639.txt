On a dusty stretch of track outside Colton , Calif. , a railroad bull confronted three rumpled men about to hop a stalled desert-bound freight . " Turn around , " ordered the policeman , resting one hand menacingy on his gun . Frisking the hoboes , the lawman squinted in disbelief : their driver 's licenses bore upscale California addresses in West Los Angeles , Marin County and Palm Springs . " Beverly Glen Boulevard ? " the policeman demanded of one robust tramp wearing suspenders and carrying a Swiss army knife . " What is this ? " <P> Welcome to the eccentric world of recreational hoboing . The tramp from Beverly Glen is Actor Bobb Hopkins , 39 , founder of the National Hobo Association . He drives a Mercedes and until recently lived near affluent Century City in Los Angeles . On the road he carries a secret credit card , which he used once to fly home for a role . Hopkins ' companions are a Palm Springs horse breeder and a journalist . Across America , weekend hoboes include a Connecticut schoolmarm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even a Denver shopping center developer who hops freights to find remote fishing spots . They are among some 500 weekend rail riders on Hopkins ' home computer and part of the 2,000-member association , which also publishes a newsletter . Not surprisingly , the railroads are appalled . In January the Association of American Railroads labeled the hobbyists part of a " dangerous trend . " They cite 1987 " trespassing " statistics that report 582 deaths and 673 serious injuries . <P> But for hobbyists , danger is part of the scenario . " You step back into Jack London 's time , " says Hopkins , who first hopped a freight during his student acting days to attend his grandfather 's 90th birthday . " Each trip has edginess , adventure and beauty . " Hopkins and his companions are headed for Yuma , Ariz. , a wintertime hobo haven along the Colorado River . Since the bull had promised 30 days in jail and a $2,000 fine if further annoyed , everyone hid , returning well after midnight to catch the train . They succeeded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sealed containerized loads . The riders settled for a chilly flatcar under a heaving truck , leaving Colton amid a terrifying anvil chorus of wheels , cars and couplings stressing and whining . But a neophyte 's raw nerves are soon lulled by the classic rhythms of clickety-clack , as he crawls into a warm sleeping bag to enjoy a moonlit panorama of passing desert and mountains unmarred by highway billboards . <P> Approaching Yuma at midmorning , the freight slows to a crawl to accommodate track workers laying ties . Fearful the workers will throw rocks , a constant terror , the riders hide and jump off in a remote rail yard . Campground " jungles " located in trackside patches of scrub and a riverside park for relaxing and washing clothes are nearby . A notable addition to the hobo community this weekend is Tudor Williams , 44 , former chef to Movie Director Steven Spielberg . A tramp 's poem recommends making mulligan stew by putting " Whatever you 've got/ In the pot/ Heat it ' til it 's hot/ Eat it . " Williams improves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fast- food stands and collects money from hoboes who have some to buy day-old meat and vegetables . His stew takes two hours , but a grateful hobo once told him , " I ai n't had such a meal since I was on my mother 's breast . "
