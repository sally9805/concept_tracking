Today , as director of Harvard University ' s Program on Nonviolent Sanctions , the soft-spoken scholar is considered one of the world ' s leading proponents of nonviolent struggle. // // And like Renaissance statesman Niccolo Machiavelli , Sharp is a pragmatist . Almost obsessively so. // He preaches the power of nonviolent force to the nation ' s ' ' princes ' ' - the military and political leaders who shape United States defense strategy . But he says his ' ' gospel ' ' has nothing to do with religion , morality , or social justice - and little to do with peace. // ' ' Peace ? No , we ' re not talking about peace , ' ' says Sharp with quiet intensity , leaning forward in his chair . ' ' We ' re talking about alternatives to violent struggle. ' ' // A deliberate man with ruddy cheeks and wavy brown hair , Sharp articulates these alternatives in a tiny office tucked away in a building that houses the Harvard School of Design. // When Harvard carved a niche for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was legitimized . He says he felt further vindicated in 1984 when a condensed version of his three-part opus , ' ' The Politics of Nonviolent Action , ' ' was translated into both Hebrew and Arabic and distributed at Jerusalem ' s Center for the Study of Nonviolence. // But with its financial struggles and fringe status at the university , the Harvard program has not yet reached its potential. // ' ' Nobody abandons violence if it is viewed as the most effective means of struggle , ' ' Sharp says . ' ' People will only accept nonviolent struggle if it is more effective than violence. ' ' // That ' s why , in his writings , he sidesteps issues of morality , religion , and pacifism . He prefers a vision of nonviolent action based on power , not peace . Indeed , the cornerstone of his work is the belief that political power depends on the people ' s support and/or submission . When citizens are thoroughly trained in ways to withdraw that support , he says , a ruler can not rule , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his points by referring to real-life examples of nonviolent resistance - from ancient Rome to modern Manila . In ' ' The Politics of Nonviolent Action ' ' Sharp traces the often-neglected history of nonviolent boycotts , strikes , symbolic protests , and organized disruption. // Unlike Mohandas Gandhi and Martin Luther King , both of whom sought spiritual reconciliation and education , Sharp ' s ' ' end product is success , ' ' says Michael Nagler , a professor at the University of California , Berkeley . ' ' . . . He invites people to use his techniques without making nonviolence a way of life. ' ' // Many observers applaud Sharp ' s pragmatism . ' ' He ' s taken the concept of nonviolent action off the pedestal , ' ' says Paul Wehr , chairman of the sociology department at the University of Colorado , Boulder . ' ' The peace movement has had too little concern for alternatives . But that ' s changing , because people like Sharp are doing so much research. ' ' // But others think Sharp ' s avoidance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleague criticized Sharp ' s admiring study of Gandhi ' s political wisdom in ' ' Gandhi as a Political Strategist ' ' ; he feels that Sharp failed Gandhi by failing to assess the crucial role of religion in Gandhi ' s political action. // And Dr. Nagler regrets that his colleague sacrifices the power of conviction in his pursuit of the power of numbers . ' ' Gene ' s so concerned not to appear flaky , ' ' he says . ' ' He ' s afraid the policy people - and it ' s the policy elite he ' s really aiming at - will reject what he has to say without even considering it. ' ' // Sharp defends his approach . ' ' I ' m insisting on protection rather than trying to change the world , ' ' he says , adding that if it is ever to succeed , nonviolent action must work for ' ' people who don ' t necessarily believe as you do. ' ' // In his most recent book , ' ' Making Europe Unconquerable , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nations should look into nonviolent defense alternatives . He argues that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) should be replaced by civilian-based defense ( not to be confused with civil defense , often identified with the preparation of bomb shelters ) . Such a defense strategy , he explains , would prepare populations in noncooperation and defense so they would be nettlesome and perhaps ' ' unconquerable ' ' by an invader such as the Soviet Union. // The concept has caught on in Scandinavia , where several countries have integrated some civilian-based training into their weapons-based defense strategies . In West Germany last month , a leader of the anti-NATO , anti-nuclear Greens party emerged from the party ' s four-day congress and called for a sweeping system of ' ' weaponless social defense. ' ' // But most political scientists - including Sharp himself - agree that the US will be one of the last countries to ' ' transarm ' ' - to begin the crossover from weapon-based defense to civilian-based defense . The psychological hurdles to its acceptance seem much higher here , says Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science at Yale University . He says the key question - and limitation - for such a defense strategy is , ' ' How much real social solidarity can be mustered in a society ? ' ' // That question needs more investigation , says Sharp . But he is set in his opinion on the current NATO policy of deterrence : ' ' The capacity to defend in order to deter has been replaced by the capacity to destroy without the ability to defend . We ' ve been misled . Our offensive fixation has distracted us from the vital task of defense . ' ' That same fixation , Sharp says , has warped our reaction to terrorism . He concedes that no one has thoroughly investigated the role of nonviolence in addressing terrorism . But ' ' the whole concept that you deal with it by dropping bombs and retaliating is a bit of nonsense , ' ' he told Ted Koppel on ABC ' s ' ' Nightline ' ' program after the US bombing of Libya in April . ' ' It distracts attention from their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonviolently - from both sides - Sharp contends . He suggests that part of the response has to include political sanctions , economic boycotts , and disruption of the offending government or group. // ' ' Negotiations are not an alternative to violence , ' ' Sharp says . ' ' The negotiation process is one of peeking under the table to see how big a club the other guy has . . . . The capacity for violence is still there . But you have to have some other form of struggle. ' ' // He says nonviolent resistance is the only practical alternative. // //
