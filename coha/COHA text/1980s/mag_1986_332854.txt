The dismal Washington summer din is mostly about Justice William Rehnquist 's old memos and about sanctions against South Africa . None of this even starts to be as important as the question of what we are going to do in space . ! <P> National security is no longer defined by nuclear warheads and aircraft carriers . The larger forces now shaping our globe are communications , the state of technology , economic vitality and the international respect all that creates . Weapons are secondary . <P> At the very heart of this concern lie our understanding of the heavens and our prowess in putting up satellites to probe and spy and report . Yet since the Challenger disaster , we have dithered like children . After six months of debate on the issue , a Cabinet council split evenly on the question of a new orbiter . Pentagon officials and others have taken to announcing their own proposals , including ideas like building unmanned rockets or having the military take over the shuttle program . <P> Ronald Reagan has sensed the larger picture , nagging his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week the White House plans to announce its scheme to get going again . <P> But one more space shuttle will not meet the challenge . For the moment , America has lost its nerve and its vision from the top down . What we do in space now is just as important as the Panama Canal , the atom bomb , the cure for polio , the trip to the moon . The most frightening deficit is in boldness . <P> Last February the Soviets put up a new space outpost called Mir ( Peace ) . In March they docked a crew on the station , then fired up a couple of supply payloads . Next the crew taxied out to Salyut 7 , another of their space redoubts . They returned to Mir and landed back on earth a few weeks ago . A maneuver like that by U.S. astronauts would have made even the Senate windbags look up . <P> The Soviets are 15 years ahead of us in manned space experience . They outspend us up there 4 to 1 . Why ? Because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Kennedy said a quarter of a century ago . <P> It is not a matter of cosmic toys for scientists . If we do n't keep pioneering out there , others will shove us aside  --  and anybody who cares to notice can already feel the elbows . <P> We do n't need one new shuttle . We need three or four . The nation 's sharpest aerospace analyst , First Boston 's Wolfgang Demisch , suggests that a single shuttle will build us right back into the mess we are trying to climb out of . A fleet of four shuttles ( three current , one new ) will have to work perfectly to meet our needs . " It 's like the Soviet economy , " says Demisch . " If everything works 100% , it is fine . It never does . When one part fails , the whole system fails . We need a realistic program . We are approaching a national emergency . We are re-creating our own crisis . " <P> Tom Paine , NASA 's boss when we landed on the moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim thoughts . NASA has tried to do too much with too little . Its $7.7 billion budget is not chicken feed . But it is not much ; after all , we are spending $25 billion for subsidies that are not solving the farm problem . A NASA budget of $10 billion or even $20 billion , taken from other places , is perfectly parsimonious considering the dividends .
