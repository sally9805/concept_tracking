Three of Author Walker Percy 's five previous novels bear titles with implications of apocalypse : The Last Gentleman , Love in the Ruins and The Second Coming . The other two , The Moviegoer and Lancelot , are exceptions in name only . For all of Percy 's fiction revolves around a central question : can humane , civilized life survive this murderous , mechanized century ? Details change from book to book , but a number of constants recur . The hero is typically a Southerner and a loner , a weirdo in the eyes of friends and relatives , whose despair at the decline of civilization has lured him into alcoholism , drug addiction or rampant crankiness . His struggle back toward health and sanity is usually undertaken with the help of a younger woman , who may be as wounded a victim of modern life as he . The saving grace is just that : a recognition that Christian , specifically Roman Catholic , teachings can still offer hope to lost souls . And the setting tends to be Louisiana , where Percy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> That , in essence , is the plot of The Thanatos Syndrome , but Percy has done more here than simply repeat himself . The theme may be familiar , but the variations decidedly are not . For one thing , this novel embodies Percy 's most detailed , explicit attack on contemporary materialism and science . For another , the philosophical warfare has been artfully disguised as a thriller . <P> The time is the mid-1990s , and Dr. Tom More has returned home to Feliciana parish , that swath of Louisiana land running " from the Mississippi to the Pearl , from the thirty-first parallel to the Crayola blue of Lake Pontchartrain . " More ( a prominent , visionary presence in Love in the Ruins ) has spent two years in a minimum-security federal prison in Alabama for peddling uppers and downers . " I needed the money , " he tells the two physician friends who have been charged with overseeing his probation . Now Tom , alcoholism temporarily in control , needs to resume his psychiatric practice . The trouble is , no one in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has to offer . <P> The former patients he manages to see behave strangely : " In each there has occurred a sloughing away of the old terrors , worries , rages , a shedding of guilt like last year 's snakeskin , and in its place is a mild fond vacancy , a species of unfocused animal good spirits . " Among the victims of this odd malady is Tom 's second wife Ellen , who in his enforced absence has become a star on the tournament bridge circuit . She has developed the ability to compute exactly the location of all cards in the hands of her partner and opponents . She speaks in two-word sentences and flaunts herself sexually like a pongid . The baffled shrink wonders , " In a word , what 's going on here ? "
