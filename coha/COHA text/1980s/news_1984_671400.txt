The biggest change is the racial composition of the student body. // Change in Racial Balance // The percentage of white students in the school system has dropped by more than half , while the percentage of black students has increased substantially . School officials say so many whites have abandoned the system that not enough are left to provide racial balance. // While the court could not formally involve itself in academic issues , the intervention had a wide effect because of the self-examination it forced upon a school system that had focused on maintaining the status quo . In addition to changing the system ' s racial balance , the desegregation order and the introspection it inspired have brought about a number of changes . These are some of them : // // - It provided an early showcase for the concept of magnet schools , allowing students to choose schools that offer programs in specialized areas such as the arts or sciences. // // - The order requiring school officials to match schools with corporations and universities became a harbinger of business and university collaboration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 percent from 9 percent among teachers and to 29 percent from 13 percent among administrators. // // - Standardized curriculums have been developed in which children in the same grade throughout the system now study the same subjects and are tested to evaluate progress on goals. // But there is disagreement among experts as to what these changes have really accomplished . " Boston is an example that the good old days weren ' t so good , " said Gregory R. Anrig , president of the Educational Testing Service , who is a former State Commissioner of Education in Massachusetts . " It was a poorly run school system for blacks and whites with overcrowded classes , small numbers of students going to college and a teaching force that was very provincial . Now , teachers and principals are more diverse and achievement levels have gone up , particularly in recent years. " // But William J. Leary , Superintendent of Schools in Broward County , Fla. , who headed the Boston schools from 1972 to 1975 , disagrees. // " The Boston schools are probably no better today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a long way to go , but it had some good comprehensive high schools and the partnerships with businesses and universities had begun before desegregation . The changes were germinating . " <> <> Scores Have Improved // Whether academic achievement has improved is difficult to determine because few comparative statistics are available . Scores have risen , however . Average scores on achievement tests in reading and mathematics increased throughout the system in every grade in 1984 over 1983 . In general , students in the lower grades scored above the national median , and those in higher grades scored below it. // Nonetheless , the average student at eight of Boston ' s 17 high schools still trails 70 percent of the students in the country in reading . Only three high schools have reading scores above the national median and only four have math scores above the median . And the entire school system produced just six semifinalists in last year ' s competition for National Merit Scholarships , the same number as in 1974. // End to Supervision Sought // Federal District Judge Arthur W. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking to end jurisdiction over the system , which has been unable to close a building or reassign a pupil without being accountable to the court . City and school officials say such supervision is no longer needed. // School officials submitted a plan Dec. 20 to Judge Garrity as a step toward a consent decree for continuing to operate the schools in keeping with the intent of the hundreds of court orders in the case . The judge has said he would like to end supervision by June. // An end to the court ' s active involvement would mark a turning point in what has been the North ' s most publicized desegregation case. // In the decade , the percentage of non- Hispanic white students in city schools has dropped to 26. 5 from 57. 2 , while the percentage of black students has increased to 48 percent from 34 percent . Ten years ago , the total enrollment of 93 , 647 included 53 , 593 whites , 31 , 963 blacks and 8 , 091 others . Today , there are 57 , 400 students , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 14 , 743 of other heritage. // The drop in white attendance is caused not only by whites ' abandoning the school system , but also by a lower birthrate and migration to the suburbs . Crucially , a majority of Boston ' s school-age white children , 19 , 637 of them , attend nonpublic schools . Enrollment in Boston ' s predominantly white parochial schools has declined , but the decline has been slower than that of the public schools since 1974. // There are so few white students that blacks have in some cases been bused to attend schools with other blacks. // " The racial balance plan is mathematically impossibile to carry out , " said John R. Coakley , who oversees pupil assignment from an office with huge maps pinned to walls and strewn across the floor . " We are rapidly reaching the point where white enrollment is so small that the arithmetic of the case is losing its sense . " <> <> Effect of Volunteer Plan // A volunteer busing program established in the 1960 ' s by private citizens also affects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 minority children to suburban schools . The children who volunteer to participate tend to be among the higher achievers in the Boston public system. // Under the court order , the school system was divided into eight districts . The schools in each district were assigned percentages by which their racial balance could vary from those of other schools . Even so , Mr. Coakley said , because of the shortage of whites , 44 of the city ' s 62 elementary schools are out of precise compliance. // The court requirement for pairing schools with universities and businesses has had a major effect . The Massachusetts Institute of Technology , for example , helped set up a magnet junior high school in East Boston for science and mathematics. // There is less violence in the schools than in the early years of desegregation , when $10 million had to be spent on police protection , but there is no way to compare how safe schools are now with the years before 1974 , when no security force existed and incidents were not recorded . <> <> Reports of Violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 101 officers and statistics are kept on incidents , which are becoming less frequent . Last year , there were 48 assaults with dangerous weapons , 57 attacks on staff members and 98 robberies in the 123 school buildings . In all of the categories , there was a decline from the previous year. // The rise in black teachers and administrators came about because of strict quotas set by Judge Garrity . They were enforced so strictly that when budget cuts in 1981 and 1982 caused dismissal of 1 , 000 tenured teachers , virtually all were white. // Daily attendance over the 10 years has risen from 82 percent to 86 percent , and the portion of graduates going on to further education has increased from 41 percent to 62 percent . But the annual dropout rate climbed to 14. 2 percent from 4. 4 percent. // " The desegregation order was a blessing to the school system , " said John O ' Bryant , who in 1977 became the first black elected to the Boston School Committee . " The school system was in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that the court order set up mechanisms whereby all schools were monitored , not just for integration but also for the level of the academic programs . " <> <> Much Turnover for 7 Years // Despite the court action , there seemed to be little academic progress until a Schools Superintendent arrived who remained long enough to take advantage of the climate for change . In the first seven years of desegregation there were six superintendents. // The Superintendent who stayed was Robert R. Spillane , who assumed the post in 1981 . Mr. Spillane , 50 years old , a former deputy education commissioner of New York State , has sought to increase confidence by raising standards. // " A school system can ' t be turned around in two or three years , " Mr. Spillane said . " We ' re still very much in a remedial mode in the high schools and it will take a lot of well-prepared youngsters coming up through the system before things are different. " // Under Mr. Spillane , a curriculum unchanged for 15 years has been revamped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beginning in 1986 , test scores will be a used as a basis for grade-to-grade promotion . <> <> Uniformity Was Lacking // Previously , there was no assurance that youngsters in the same grade in different schools studied the same material . Now , in social studies , for example , all sixth graders study the nations of the Eastern Hemisphere , all seventh graders study Canada and Latin America and all eighth graders study the United States. // The dwindling number of white students are spread among the public schools through an intricate plan that calls for racial balance to be re-established each year . It is complicated by the need to put some pupils in bilingual classes and by a program for handicapped students that enrolls 20 percent of all of Boston ' s students , twice as many as the national average. // The system now has 22 magnet schools , which are meant to promote desegregation without compulsory assignments . Madison Park High School , for instance , specializes in the performing arts and Copley Square High School focuses on international studies. // But the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not filled the racial requirements . So some students have been assigned to magnet schools for purposes of balance , and others have been denied admittance for the same reason. // In a nonmagnet school like Charlestown High , which ostensibly is fairly well balanced , immigrants from China make up 30 percent of the enrollment and many are in bilingual classes in which they seldom see a black student . In fact , the only way a Charlestown student can take physics or calculus , which are not part of the regular program , is to attend bilingual Chinese classes. // " There are not enough white kids to go around , " said Robert F. Murphy , the headmaster of Charlestown High . Ten years ago the school was 92 percent white ; today the figure is 17 percent , although the neighborhood around it remains a white enclave . <> <> Union Chief Unhappy // " A lot of people have been unnecessarily hurt , " said Edward J.

" // Students in Boston ' s middle schools are too young to recall the days before the yellow buses carried them away from their neighborhoods . One of them , 14-year-old Cerci Crawford , who attends William B. Rogers Middle School in Hyde Park , has a philosophical view. // " We all live in the same city and we should go to school together , " she said . " There ' s really no difference between white people and black people . White and black are just colors. " // //
