But the fact is we are rushing things a bit . There are still hot and sunny days ahead , and to find proof one has only to walk through the fairgrounds ' smell of trodden grass and earth to the exhibition hall where the vegetables are arranged among the prized ribbons . The award-winning tomatoes are handsomely green - the fair has come so soon that tomatoes have not had time to ripen in this northern horticultural zone . Bushels of other tomatoes , still clustered in gardens , will turn red before a frost stiffens their summer juices . In other parts of the garden , vegetables by the dozen are ripening impatiently. // Just as many cooks know that the secret of good corn is getting it picked and into the boiling pot with as little loss of time as possible , some are apt to be almost overwhelmed by the season ' s bounty and the urge to deal with all of it creatively . The abundance challenges the imagination , and the trick is to remember the ideas for new dishes you may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laden with possibility . As the time of fairs and festivals everywhere , it ' s the season of plenty . Snap beans , peas and garden lettuces are mostly gone from the farmers ' markets , but on town greens and roadsides the vegetable stands are heavy with red cabbages , or carrots , onions , leeks , peppers , broccoli and squash . There is an aura of good food after Labor Day in every part of the country. // In Maine , the dark green tops of potato vines start to turn brown and the small round potato bulbs form after the white and purple blossoms of summer fade . In Minnesota and Wisconsin northern roads are often jammed with cars that bring in pursuers of the wild rice harvest . In silky shallow water near towns with such names as Emily and Blackduck , a few Chippewas in canoes still paddle among the reedy plants , beating down the heads of the grain for delivery to the parching fires beside the lakes . In the flooded fields of Wisconsin and Massachusetts , the cranberry vines are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the streets of the market towns nearby , where visitors gather to feed on street food and to taste ( tentatively , perhaps ) the local cranberry wine. // As in every other season , the light keeps changing . Sometimes on late afternoons rainbow sun dogs parenthesize the sun . Cool nights follow warm , often breezy , days . There ' s a full moon this week and it ' s called the corn moon . It is a time when evening picnics seem even more tempting than the outdoor meals of midsummer . " September ' s sunshine . . . / The hovering dragonflies ' / Shimmering shadow , " Joseph Carroll wrote . Sunsets in September seem to indicate the kind of cookouts that draw us together around the campfire to eat still sputtering sausages , potatoes and ears of corn roasted in coals . The early evening light fades sooner as the Western sky fills with color , and appetites are sharper - honed by temperatures that stimulate. // This is orchard time and cider time . For generations in Maine the swing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astrachan apples , good for eating out of doors . Upcoming red Dutchesses make excellent apple sauce and pies . So do New Jersey ' s Thompson County Kings , for sale along the roads that follow the Hudson . ( Some cooks consider this Jersey fruit the finest choice for desserts and cooking . ) In Pennsylvania a favorite eating apple is Smokehouse , and in Indiana the variety called Winter Banana , a late ripener , is yellow with a blush of red and is chosen for its superb dessert quality. // When it comes to real country cider , the apple pedigrees are left behind . " You take apples that have been lying on the ground for a week , apples with blotches and cankers and damp spots , " Noel Perrin writes in a collection of essays on country life , " Second Person Rural , " " apples that would make a supermarket manager turn pale if you merely brought them in the store , and out of this unpromising material you produce not one but two delicious drinks . Sweet cider now . Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend ' s old Sears , Roebuck apple press , feeding fruit into the hopper and turning the cast-iron crank ; as the apples are pushed down you hear a squishy bubbling sound , and the juice begins to spill into the pressing tub . Sweet cider has been born , and it ' s the ancient cup-that-cheers devised to mark this lingering moment of transition. // There are other cheerful ways to toast this season within a season . It is the time when Americans make wine from apples , currants , elderberries , grapes , cherries and raspberries . Across the country , August ' s chokecherry wine will be ready to drink by the time the blackberry leaves turn wine-dark . In the meantime , the canning and preserving , just begun in thousands of rural kitchens , will result in jams , jellies , conserves , marmalades and fruit butters to add this harvest ' s flavor to the morning toast , or to be jarred and proudly labeled as gifts for Christmas . There are cooks on Martha ' s Vineyard and in the Hamptons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they produce for visitors from beach plums that cling to life along Atlantic shores. // Before the end of this week I expect a call from a neighbor not too far away to tell me that the butternuts I want are ready . We may make maple-butternut ice cream on a warm September day . In California , another cook may pick the same moment to turn out a mixture of finely grated local walnuts , grated apples and orange rind to fill a torte . In the 19th century , it was an annual event for gatherings of rustic Americans to take burlap bags to the woods at this time of the year to race the squirrels in harvesting the crops of nuts that enriched all kinds of end-of-summer cooking . Early in the same century , when September was often an election month , affluent Southerners , running for office , put on outdoor oyster roasts for constituents who competed at freeloading while platters of steaming bivalves were served up at long tables. // On Puget Sound ' s rugged shoreline , the year ' s first oysters nowadays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fire to the table . One rainy September day some years ago , my wife and I ate oysters on Fidalgo Island there as they were roasted , unwrapped , over coals , alongside a slab of freshly caught salmon , broiled on a plank . To celebrate this seasonal appearance another year , we grilled oysters over coals at a New York rooftop dinner party marking Labor Day . Al fresco eating in Manhattan has an almost unique quality after sizzling summer heat and humidity are no longer serious threats to prandial comfort . Leave the charcoal grill out of it - a sunny September morning warrants celebrating outdoors with breakfast or brunch of fried green tomatoes served with red flannel hash ( late-harvest beets in bunches in the market should catch your eye ) and hot freshly baked corn muffins studded with kernels. // At this time of the year , dinner on a terrace , or closer to the stars , can be something special as entertainment after dark .
