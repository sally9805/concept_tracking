New York has stood on the sidelines in a decade marked by the most sustained interest in improving education since the years after the launching of Sputnik in 1957 , according to educators and political leaders. // " You never run into anyone from the city at national meetings , " said Ernest L. Boyer , president of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching. // Stanley Litow , executive director of Interface , a citizens ' group , said , " There ' s a general feeling that things are so bad and the bureaucracy so entrenched that nothing can be done about New York City schools. " // Now , however , responding in part to pressure from the state , in part to a growing realization that the city ' s future depends on its public school system , New York is joining in. // The system , for example , has reduced the average size of first- and second-grade classes , begun to cut the high-school dropout rate and is opening career-oriented schools to a wider range of students. // Perhaps most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education and the central administration , which traditionally have battled over policy and day-to-day operations . In a joint statement last month , they called for a " fundamental change in perspective. " // " Our aim is to again make New York ' s schools a model for the nation , " the statement said. // " We were slower than other parts of the country to realize how absolutely critical schools are to our future , " said the recently appointed chairman of the Board of Education , Robert F. Wagner Jr . " This has changed . " The road to better schools in New York City , though , will differ substantially from that elsewhere , educators say . The size of the school system - with an enrollment of 936 , 000 , is larger than that of 40 states - and the grave social problems of the city - a third of its pupils come from families on welfare - force it to focus on issues that other districts take for granted. // " New York City is almost a world apart , " Mr. Boyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous instability . You have to address issues like nonattendance , dropouts , lack of home support and nutrition in the early years before you can even look at the basic instructional problems. " // At the same time , educators say , New York ' s need to focus on such essentials has made the city a leader on many issues that other districts are just beginning to confront. // " If you look at New York City schools in the last few months , they have attempted to be quite responsive to some major social problems - teen-age pregnancy , crack , AIDS and so forth , " said Edward J. Meade Jr. , the Ford Foundation ' s chief program officer for education . " Where that leaves substantive improvement of schooling is a good question. " // " New York City is the forerunner of trends you see nationwide , " Mr. Boyer said. // The national movement to improve public education has been inspired in part by a series of reports that have linked the quality of schools to the nation ' s future prosperity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , established new testing programs or set new standards for training and certifying teachers. // In New York State , for example , the Board of Regents has increased the number of mathematics and science courses that high-school students must take to gain a diploma and has required more attention to foreign languages in junior high school. // Until recently , however , there has been little concerted action in New York City. // " We don ' t have a reform agenda , " said Steven Redfield , who recently resigned as executive director of the United Parents Association , a coalition of parent associations throughout the city . " We have some high-visibility initiatives , but it would be hard to find a coherent program for reform. " // Several reasons are usually cited , including a lack of grass-roots support for public schools in the city and too little financial help from Albany , but always starting with the sheer size of the school system. // With its 936 , 000 students and more than 100 , 000 employees , New York City ' s public-school system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day the Board of Education helps transport more children than all the riders accommodated by Boston ' s entire public-transit system . It owns as many buildings as Howard Johnson and Ramada Inns together have in hotels and motels. // Thirty-two local school boards administer the elementary and junior high schools . If District 10 in the Riverdale section of the Bronx were an independent system , its 36 , 000 students would place it among the 100 largest in the country , just above Akron , Ohio. // " I was reading a story in the paper the other day about the Boston school system , which has 59 , 000 students , " the Schools Chancellor , Nathan Quinones , said recently . " We have that many kindergartners. " // The Board of Education , from its headquarters at 110 Livingston Street in downtown Brooklyn , administers 111 high schools. // Much of the time of senior administrators has been taken up by a recent controversy over whether to dispense contraceptives to high-school students. // City officials say that lingering effects of the city ' s fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improving classroom performance . And some argue that , at least until recently , education has not carried much of a payoff for politicians. // In contrast with suburban and rural areas , where schools routinely account for most public spending and where school taxes are often levied separately , the New York City Board of Education competes with many other priorities . Schools represent only 25 percent of the city ' s budget . Political Peculiarities Compound the Problems School advocates see political problems in the fact that minority-group members , whose children increasingly make up the school population , have tended to vote at lower rates than whites. // In addition the seven-member Board of Education is not elected , but appointed by the Mayor and the five Borough Presidents . And the problem of defining and organizing a constituency for public education and putting pressure on school leaders has been complicated for advocacy groups by decentralization and the system ' s 32 local boards. // " There don ' t seem to be very many political leaders there who want to run with the school improvement issue , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , David Berkholtz . The fund has helped establish private foundations to aid schools in 40 cities , but it has yet to find a business or citizens group to work with to establish a foundation in New York City. // School officials complain that the city is routinely short-changed by state-aid formulas. // " We educate 37 percent of the state ' s students , but we get only 32 percent of education funds , " said Mr. Quinones , who became Chancellor in 1984 after heading the high-school division for six years . " This is up from 31 percent a year ago , but we ' re still not getting what we need. " // School officials also point out that the city ' s students are more expensive to educate because a high percentage come from groups that require remedial or other special services . One-third are on public assistance , and 40 percent of the first graders come from homes where English is not spoken. // " The people in the city schools are radically different than they are in Syracuse or Lake Placid , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City , Irving S. Hamer. // Political leaders beyond the city , however , say New York has undermined its own cause by repeatedly using education funds to help balance the city budget. // " Koch ended this practice , but we still get a lot of questions in Albany about whether new money will really get to the schools , " Mr. Litow of Interface said . Changes Are Under Way Amid Pressure From State Despite these problems , observers say the stirrings of change are beginning to be felt - in part because of pressure from the state. // Under the Regents ' recently enacted Action Plan , the state ' s Department of Education released a report , based on test scores and dropout rates , that identified the 600 schools most in need of improvement . Of those , 417 , including 72 high schools , were in New York City . The city is now designing special programs to improve those schools. // The Legislature has also appropriated money for new programs to prevent dropouts and to develop bilingual , computer literacy and early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of need rather than enrollment , and New York City has received about two-thirds of the funds - double its share of general school aid. // School officials have announced new priorities of their own , including campaigns to prevent dropouts and to educate children about drug abuse , as well as a reorganization of the high schools that will open career-oriented programs to a broader range of students. // Perhaps the most aggressive effort has been to avoid the need for remedial education in higher grades by improving education in early childhood . The size of first- and second-grade classes has been reduced to 25 from 29 over the last two years , and kindergarten has been expanded from a half day to a full day. // Some observers find reason for optimism in Mayor Koch ' s appointment of Mr. Wagner , a former Deputy Mayor with high-level contacts in the business and political worlds , to run the school system. // One striking feature of the school-improvement movement across the country is the extent to which it has been directed by an alliance of corporate leaders and elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the quality of public education to remain economically competitive. // " The economic vitality issue is driving school reform , " said the president of Columbia University ' s Teachers College , Michael Timpane. // In New York City , where the business community has had little involvement in the public schools , there are now signs of change . In some cases wealthy people have pledged college scholarships to specific classes ; in others an entire school has been " adopted " by a corporation , as the American Can Company has done with Martin Luther King High School in Manhattan , providing financial aid to the school , as well as lecturers and special programs. // If business decides that it has a stake in good schools , Mr. Litow suggested , New York has a chance of rebuilding the constituency for public education that once existed. // " The people who move things along have to be convinced that the city can not survive if education does not improve , " he said . <> <> NEW YORK CITY ' S SCHOOL SYSTEM : <> PUTTING IT IN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an enrollment of 936 , 231 students .
