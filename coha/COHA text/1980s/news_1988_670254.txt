NEW YORK  --  Positive sentiment toward the dollar could be put to the test Friday with the release of U.S. trade data . Traders , however , say the dollar could hold up well even if the U.S. merchandise trade deficit is considerably wider than April ' s seasonally adjusted $9. 9 billion . Currency analysts generally look for an adjusted May figure between $10 billion and $12 billion . The April trade figures released June 14 contributed to an ensuing surge in the dollar that has yet to run out of steam despite an increase in overseas interest rates , foreign-exchange market intervention by a number of central banks and a recent period of consolidation . Expectations of a worsening of the trade gap are attributed partly to a rebound in imports , which slowed sharply in April and helped pare the trade deficit to its smallest level in more than three years . If the May trade gap is less than $10 billion , the dollar will likely jump toward 1. 88 marks and 136. 50 yen , says Jody Foulks , a foreign exchange adviser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1. 8415 marks and 133. 35 yen in late trading Friday , having climbed from 1. 7228 marks and 125. 08 yen on June 13 , the day before the April trade figures were released . The dollar stood at 1. 8415 marks and 133. 35 yen in late trading Friday , having climbed from 1. 7228 marks and 125. 08 yen on June 13 , the day before the April trade figures were released . In early trading in Tokyo Monday , the dollar was quoted at 133. 55 yen . The Federal Reserve , the Bundesbank and a number of other European central banks have reportedly been unloading dollars at various times during the recent surge , but the Bank of Japan has yet to take action . But some analysts say the Japanese central bank may increase its discount rate if the dollar gains significantly on the trade report and if June Japanese wholesale prices fuel inflationary worries . The Japanese report also is scheduled for release Friday . Though central bank intervention remains a significant concern of foreign-exchange market participants , it hasn ' t been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They ' re not really coming in with any type of strength " in their dollar sales , says Sandra Olazabal , a currency market analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities , referring to the central banks . But if the U.S. trade deficit is well above $12 billion , the dollar will test 1. 8 marks and 130 yen , says Harris Bank ' s Ms. Foulks . And Prudential-Bache ' s Ms. Olazabal warns that market sentiment isn ' t completely pro-dollar despite its recent runup . " I wouldn ' t say this is a complete turnaround of the dollar at this point , " she says . The dollar will probably ease in the days prior to the release of the trade figures , as market participants square positions ahead of the data , but its strength isn ' t generally expected to fade much , some analysts say . Even if the trade data disappoint dollar bulls , the U.S. currency probably would not surrender all of its recent gains , analysts say . A strong underpinning is seen from the surprisingly robust June U.S. employment numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate slipped to 5. 3% last month , the lowest level in 14 years , while nonfarm payrolls jumped 346 , 000 . The report suggests continued manufacturing gains , which bode well for further strong growth in the nation ' s exports , says Lars Pedersen , chief international economist for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . There was a 45 , 000 gain in manufacturing jobs in June . On the New York Commodity Exchange Friday , gold for current delivery settled unchanged at $439. 10 an ounce . Estimated volume was a moderate 2. 8 million ounces . In early trading in Hong Kong Monday , gold was quoted at $438. 90 an ounce.  --  - Table Late New York Trading Friday , July 8 , 1988 <> Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates .
