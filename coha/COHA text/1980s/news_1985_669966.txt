ATLANTA  --  Coca-Cola Co. , worn down by die-hard opposition from fans of old Coke , reversed itself and said it will sell old Coke alongside the reformulated version introduced in April . Old Coke will return in several weeks in some markets as " Coca-Cola classic , " the soft drink concern said . Meanwhile , the reformulated version , which reached nationwide distribution last month , will continue to be sold as the flagship brand Coke . Old Coke all but disappeared from store shelves last month . The move was lauded by industry observers as a fast response to market signals . But it represents a surprising turnaround for a company that prided itself as both a monitor and mirror of the American public . In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday , Coca-Cola closed at $72. 375 , up $2. 375 . " We beat Coca-Cola , " said Frank Olson of Old Coke Drinkers of America , a Seattle group that claims to have recruited 100 , 000 members in a drive to bring back old Coke . The group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest march in Dallas later this month and was organizing a boycott in Australia . Coca-Cola executives didn ' t return telephone calls to elaborate on the company statement . A company spokesman said Coca-Cola will release details of the Coke classic introduction today . Coca-Cola bottlers , who had grown increasingly nervous about the grass-roots opposition to the April switch , said they favored the return of old Coke . " The results were showing that new Coke was testing out stronger than expected . That was the topside , " said Crawford Johnson , a Birmingham , Ala . , Coca-Cola bottler . " But some consumers were mad . It was almost a pyschological thing . " Coca-Cola had released figures showing that new Coke syrup shipments to bottlers were up a strong 8% in May . But Coca-Cola also had disclosed that it was getting 1 , 500 calls a day to its consumer hotline , compared with 400 daily before the April switch . Coca-Cola mailed coupons for a free six-pack of new Coke to those who complained . Figures aren ' t available yet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring back old Coke and sell it alongside new Coke is a dramatic twist in the marketing strategy laid out by Roberto C. Goizueta , Coca-Cola chairman and chief executive officer . During the research on new Coke , Mr. Goizueta and Donald R. Keough , president and chief operating officer , mulled whether to introduce the new formula as a sister cola under the name " Coke 100 " in commemoration of the company ' s centennial . But Mr. Goizueta torpedoed the idea for fear of confusing consumers and cannibalizing the flagship cola . " It was obvious the best tasting cola should be Coke , " he explained in a May interview . Industry analysts said Coca-Cola was forced to bring back old Coke to staunch the migration of customers to other soft drinks . " The further South it went the more disappointing the results , " said Emanuel Goldman of Montgomery Securities . Coca-Cola conducted extensive marketing surveys to convince itself that new Coke would be accepted by old Coke drinkers and even steal Pepsi drinkers . More than 200 , 000 drinkers secretly tasted variations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coca-Cola ' s research apparently didn ' t detect that many consumers would react emotionally to the departure of old Coke . " The company didn ' t fathom the depth of the emotional commitment to Coke , " said Jesse Meyers , publisher of Beverage Digest , a trade newsletter . Coca-Cola introduced new Coke in hopes of blunting the popularity of PepsiCo Inc. ' s Pepsi-Cola with younger drinkers . Pepsi-Cola ' s sales volume grew 6. 8% last year . Brand Coke ' s sales haven ' t grown that fast annually for seven years . And Pepsi-Cola had passed Coke in the highly competitive grocery-store segment of the market . PepsiCo was exuberant about its rival ' s decision . " It shows what we ' ve felt all along , " said Roger Enrico , president and chief executive of Pepsi-Cola USA , a division . " Coke ' s got lemon on its hands and now they ' re trying to make lemonade out of it . " It doesn ' t worry us , " said Mr. Enrico of the Purchase , N.Y.-based company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we ' re not concerned about the second , which no one seems to like . " He said Pepsi won ' t change its " new generation " advertising theme but might modify its advertising slightly . When asked if sales picked up since the April introduction of new Coke , he said it was " really hard to determine . . . Our business is booming . I ' m not sure it had much effect one way or another in such a short time . " A PepsiCo spokeswoman said that its soft drinks were selling at " record levels " and that total sales in May were up 12% . In March , brand Coke held 18. 2% of the take-home segment of the soft-drink industry , compared with Pepsi-Cola ' s 19. 5% share , according to Mr. Meyers . However , all of Coca-Cola ' s soft-drink products , which include diet Coke and Tab , outstripped PepsiCo ' s corporate share . In March , Coca-Cola ' s soft drinks held 32. 5% of the take-home segment , while PepsiCo ' s products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Coca-Cola had brushed aside reports about disgruntled Coke drinkers . It claimed that only 1% of those who didn ' t like the reformulation were switching brands , and that most of the grousing was by older drinkers who aren ' t big sugar-cola drinkers anyway . But Coca-Cola admitted in its announcement yesterday that " thousands of dedicated Coca-Cola consumers have told us they still want the original taste as an option . " The company statement delicately said that " everybody wins " through the move . Some industry analysts had speculated for the past few weeks that Coca-Cola would bring back old Coke as a sister drink to new Coke . Mr. Goldman said the Coke classic move permits Coca-Cola to recapture the die-hard Coke drinkers it had lost through the April switch . Hugh S. Zurkuhlen of Salomon Brothers Inc. said the twin sugar-based , caffeine colas are likely to spur Coca-Cola ' s volume . " There is a fixed and significant market for old Coke , " he said .

However , Mr. Meyers of Beverage Digest said the combination of old and new Coke would " greatly increase " the Atlanta company ' s share of the sugar-cola segment . " It ' s a horse race out there , " Mr. Meyers said . The decision to bring back old Coke apparently gathered steam after a Monday meeting in Atlanta between 30 bottlers and Brian G. Dyson , president of Coca-Cola ' s domestic unit . At the Monday meeting , bottlers were asked to discuss hypothetically what to call old Coke if it were brought back . They scrapped suggestions to call old Coke " old " or " original . " But even with that clue , the bottlers were startled at how quickly Coca-Cola management moved . " I felt that if they were going to do it , it would have been a few more weeks , " a bottler said .
