txt REV . LEON SULLIVAN is considered one of America 's most successful black minister-leaders. lie has a great speaking voice . Ile 's 6 foot e , has a Philadelphia congregation of more than 5,000 , and is on the board of directors of General Motors Corp . The Rev. Mr. Sullivan is pastor of Philly 's Zion Baptist Church , which launched an economic self-help program nearly 10 years ago that captured the attention of the media and those in the corporate world who wanted to " help blacks who were attempting to help themselves . " He is one of the country 's strongest voices in support of capitalism , rugged individualism , and bootstrap economics . The Rev. Mr. Sullivan introduced an old-fashioned black self-help program to his congregation in the early 1960s , the ' kind of program that Booker T. Washington urged during the turn of the century . Zion church members were asked to contribute 010 per month for au months to an economic investment program . It was a great idea . In less than two years the investors had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Progress Plaza Shopping Center and then the Progress Iladdington Shopping Center , just last year . TIL  --  T 'S NOT ALL . Nearly 10 years ago Sullivan organized the Progress Aero Space Plant that manufactured some of the Instruments used in the Apollo space flights , Meanwhile , Sullivan founded the ( lp portunities Industrial Centers , Inc . ( OIC ) , which established job-training centers in several major cities . Most knowledgeable white industrial-lots and political leaders , and I would wager most blacks , consider the Rev. Mr. Sullivan to be a moderate voice on the subject of civil rights . However , his moderate image probably will be altered after his recent speech at the 72d Annual Convention of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) in Denver . The strapping , 50-year-old minister evoked a medley of " amens , " " right ens , " " preach it , brother , " and other exclamations when he took off on black participation in politics and the future of South Africa . SULLIVAN CALLED FOR a " black connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must cooperate in such a way that no political party in America has our vote in its pocket , " he declared . " We have been doublecrossed too many times , " he continued . ' ' No political party is really our friend . Political parties are Impersonal . They are pragmatic Instruments of self-interest and they will do no more for you than they have to do . " Trust no one , no one but yourselves . Not even white liberals . We need and we welcome their help , but we can not depend on them . we have learned that they also will do us M. They can help us but not lead us . " The Rev. Mr. Sullivan 's sped ' also exposed a growing sensitivity among black moderates about President Reagan 's budget cuts and his dalliance with South Africa . Sullivan addressed himself to the precarious South African situation four years ago when he introduced his moderate " Sullivan Platt " for American industries there . ? In essence , Ins plan called for American industries to take the lead in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged block Americans to place pressure on American investors in South Africa . " We must say to those American companies . that take advantage of black people through cheap labor , that you must either get your act straightened out . . . or we 're going to see to it that you ship . out . " The tnan known for the last 30 years as a moderate voice in the black community appeared enraged . " We must say to those banks ( who lend money to South African governmental agencies and businesses ) , if you continue , we will publish your names on the bulletin boards of our churches , run your names in our NAACP newsletter , " he declared to a stirred-up banquet audience . " We will take our deposits out of your banks and we will picket you if we have to , " he said . That 's what can happen to a moderate black leader when his advice goes unheeded by those who claim to respect ldm.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
