Christmas ' 82 : On Sale Now But customers are cautious as they play a waiting game with U.S. retailers <P> SALE . The word was everywhere last week in recession-weary , unemployment-plagued , pre-Christmas America . It stood alone or with exclamation marks in all its variations : reduced , discounted , cut , specially priced and slashed . <P> The word flanked department-and specialty-store aisles from Maine to California . It paraded through chic boutiques in Manhattan and Beverly Hills ' Rodeo Drive . It marched through newspaper advertising and charged into glossy supplements . On television , it assaulted millions of viewers . <P> It was on almost everything , from television sets to dinnerware to cameras and video games , Belgian waffle makers , foot massagers , pots , pans , cutlery and apparel of all kinds . So far at least , the drumfire of discounting is having the desired impact of making at least some stores busy . But much of what is happening so far this season is flash without great substance , chiefly because of the sales . Says Michael @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are buying more , but they 're spending less . " <P> Price cutting started earlier , has gone deeper and affected more items than in any Christmas shopping season in memory . Christmas sales began two to three weeks before they usually do , well before Thanksgiving . <P> By some accounts , the sales effectively began as far back as October , when shopkeepers were coming out of a depressing summer with overstocked shelves after 15 months of recession , rising unemployment and sick sales of everything from cars to refrigerators . Now retailers are hopeful that the price slashing will seduce shoppers , resulting in at least respectable overall sales for 1982 . Many shopkeepers count on Christmas for a third to a half of any year 's profits . <P> Many of them stand to be disappointed . In general , sales are better on both coasts then they are in the Midwestern middle , the " rust bowl , " hardest hit by joblessness and industrial anemia . Almost nowhere , though , are sales truly brisk . Unusually warm weather in the East , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in two ways . It has cut into sales of winter clothing . It also made Christmas seem not so near , reducing what Economist Alan Greenspan calls the " sense of urgency " needed to press people into stores . <P> Shoppers now coolly wait for prices to come down before buying . If they do not see what they want at the right price , they bide their time until prices drop . Says Ann Colwell , 28 , a Dallas publicist : " It 's a consumer-oriented Christmas , " as if somehow it rarely had been until this year . She is waiting for Evan-Picone suits at Sanger Harris to go on sale . When they do , she will buy . Said Martin Tolep , economist for F.W. Woolworth : " By waiting , they 're going to make some retailers frantic . "
