It derived from his being signed to a contract with the New York Giants in 1915 , when he was a 15-year-old student at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn , though he didn ' t get into a big-league game with the Giants until 1918 , and then for just one inning . The next year he was traded to the Boston Red Sox , and there his outstanding career took flight. // Though he pitched for seven clubs , his finest days were with the powerful Yankee teams from 1921 to 1930 . Two years ago he was in New York from Cincinnati to attend a Yankee Old- Timers ' Day , and the next week this reporter interviewed him for a television documentary. // " Years have flown , " he said , " years have flown . The other day , when they called our names at the Stadium , I went out and stood on the mound just to see how it felt , once more . Oh , Jesus , it made you - well , I got teary , just standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was a man of what might be average size today - 6 feet and 180 pounds - but fairly large for his day . He was an old man now , white hair combed neatly straight back , tie just right and sparkle in his eyes . They had obviously never lost the effervescence of his school days . That , and his large , strong hands , with which he punctuated , prodded and shaped his sentences , were memorable. // Hoyt ' s big-league playing days ended in 1938 , and four years later he became a radio announcer for the Cincinnati Reds games . His reputation as a raconteur grew . Fans looked forward to rain delays so they could listen to the stories he spun , the best of which were captured in a record album called " Waite Hoyt in the Rain. " // His favorites were about his teammate Babe Ruth . His tales of that grand American folk hero helped to illuminate not only Ruth but Waite Hoyt as well. // " The first time that I ever saw Babe Ruth was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I walked in to report to the Red Sox , and they took me around and introduced me to everybody on the team , and when they got to him - you know , he couldn ' t remember anybody ' s name , he ' d call you ' Happy Jack , ' ' Pete , ' ' Charlie , ' ' Stud , ' anything that came up in his mind - and he said , ' Hello , keed . ' And he ' s sitting there , and he didn ' t look like a monster or anything , but he had black curly hair that dripped down over his forehead like ink , like there was spilled ink on his forehead , and he was utterly unbelievable. // " There is nothing like Ruth ever existed in this game of baseball . I remember we were playing the White Sox in Boston in 1919 , and he hit a home run off Lefty Williams over the left-field fence in the ninth inning and won the game . It was majestic . It soared . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy hit a ball like that ? ' It was to the opposite field and off a left- handed pitcher , and it was an incredible feat . That was the dead-ball days , remember ; the ball normally didn ' t carry . We were playing a doubleheader , and that was the first game , and the White Sox did not go into the clubhouse between games . They stood out there and sat on our bench and talked about the magnificence of that home run . " Ruth was a man of prodigious appetites , including drink , though " he was not a drunk , " Hoyt emphasized . " And he liked the ladies , as who doesn ' t , but he liked them to an excess ; he was a champion in that sport , too . But he was popular with everybody , and everybody forgave him . In Chicago , we used to go to church with Ruth . I ' m Protestant , and he was Catholic , and the Protestants wanted to go with Ruth to watch him . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Babe would put a fifty-dollar bill in the plate , and the guy ' s eyes would pop open . The Babe was paying for his sins , and we always got a kick out of that. " // Another time in Chicago , an attractive " bon ton " woman was walking down the steps of the hotel where the Yankees were staying . Ruth and a group of teammates were about to take a taxi to the ball park. // " The girl said to Babe , ' You ' re Mr. Ruth , aren ' t you ? ' He said , ' Yeah , that ' s me . ' She said , ' Mr. Ruth , we ' re going to the ball park . Would you like to ride with us ? ' He said , ' Gee , swell . ' So he ' s waiting for the car , and finally two little old ladies join the girl and Ruth , and drive off . The car was one of those old electric things without a steering wheel ! It ' s going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat , and we pass him on Michigan Boulevard . We called out , ' Ho , Babe ! Hello , Babe ! ' Babe looked kind of ugly in that big moon face , and he had an expression that would have killed a mule. " // In 1948 , when Ruth was dying of cancer , Hoyt and his wife were moved by a visit to the old slugger in his Manhattan hotel . The visit , which Bob Creamer described in the book " Babe , " was short , because Ruth was tired and in great pain . But before the Hoyts left , Ruth stood up and went to the refrigerator . He took a small vase with an orchid in it and brought it back to the living room . " Here , " he said to Mrs. Hoyt , " I never gave you anything . " Shortly afterward , in August 1948 , // Hoyt was one of the honorary // pallbearers at Ruth ' s funeral. // " For some reason , " said Hoyt , " there was a reverence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a joke , everything that could possibly be incorporated in a man ' s character and disposition and personality . Joe Dugan , who was my roommate on the Yankees , was an honorary pallbearer , too . He was standing next to me as they were carrying the Babe down the steps of St. Pat ' s Cathedral here in New York . There must have been 5 , 000 people standing around on the sides of the street , and it was tremendous. // " It was a hot day , oh , a sinful day , about 98 degrees , and St. Pat ' s didn ' t have air-conditioning , and the sweat was running down our faces and dripping down our chins . And just as they were carrying the Babe down the steps of St. Pat ' s , Dugan , who used to talk out of the side of his mouth , whispered to me , ' Gee , I ' d like to have a beer . ' Just then the casket with the professional pallbearers went by . ' Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // //
