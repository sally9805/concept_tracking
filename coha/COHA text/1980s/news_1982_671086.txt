The big traders were the New England Patriots , who dealt Francis to the San Francisco 49ers and Fox to the San Diego Chargers , and the Los Angeles Rams , who got Jones from the Baltimore Colts and Barber from the Houston Oilers. // As expected , the first choice from the pool of college seniors was Kenneth Sims , the Texas defensive tackle , who was picked by the Patriots . Then the Colts brought about a coup . Within six minutes , they claimed not only Art Schlichter , the Ohio State quarterback whom they had been coveting , but also Johnnie Cooks of Mississippi State , regarded in many quarters as the top linebacker in the pool. // Baltimore selected Cooks with its own choice , the second in the draft , then announced the trading of Jones , their quarterback . The trade , in the works for weeks , was completed one hour before the draft . In return , Los Angeles sent Baltimore one selection on the first round and one on the second . <> <> Browns Choose Banks // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking third , had selected Chip Banks , a linebacker from Southern California . Then , using the first-round choice they had received from the Rams , the Colts selected Schlichter , who will apparently be Jones ' s successor. // Francis , the tight end who starred for six years at New England , then retired before last season , had a change of heart recently and let it be known that he wanted to play again . But he wanted to be on the West Coast , and asked the Patriots to trade him there. // In complying with his request , New England received from the 49ers , the Super Bowl champions , one selection on the first round and one on the fourth . With Sims already in the fold , the Patriots used their new first-round choice , the last selection in the round , to draft Lester Williams of the University of Miami . Williams was the second defensive lineman they had hoped to obtain and , like Sims , will play at end. // Fox , the Patriots ' strong safety , was traded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-round choice next year . The second-round choice had come to the Chargers from Green Bay as part payment for the wide receiver John Jefferson , who was traded last year . That selection , now in the possession of New England , proved to be Robert Weathers , a running back from Arizona State . <> <> A Complex Deal // Houston sent Barber , a tight end , to the Rams in a complex deal announced near the end of the first round . Barber and the Oilers ' choices in the third and eighth rounds went to Los Angeles in exchange for Lewis Gilbert , an obscure tight end , and two draft choices the Rams had acquired from other teams - Tampa Bay ' s second and Denver ' s third. // The four traded veterans had all asked to be moved , Jones because of his continual disagreements with the Baltimore owner , Robert Irsay ; Francis , who is from Hawaii , because of his wish to play for a West Coast team ; Barber so he could play as a regular again , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had grown disenchanted. // Jones is considered certain to be the Rams ' starting quarterback , ending the team disorder at that position . Barber , who had lost out to Dave Casper in Houston , will compete with Henry Childs to be the Rams ' starting tight end . Francis , a former Pro Bowl performer , is likely to displace Charle Young as the No. 1 tight end for San Francisco . And Fox will fill a desperate need in a San Diego defense that faltered badly last season . <> <> Parrish Dealt to Bills // All this movement was followed last night by another deal involving a well-known veteran . Lemar Parrish of the Washington Redskins , who had asked to be traded because of differences with Richie Petitbon , the defensive coordinator , was sent to the Buffalo Bills for a fifth-round draft choice . Parrish is an eight-time allpro at cornerback , but at age 34 may be nearing the end of his career . He is not considered likely to mount a serious threat for a starting position against Mario Clark or Charles Romes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been forecast as uneven - strong in candidates at running back but thin at most other positions . The first round ' s selections seemed to support that assessment. // Seven running backs were chosen in the opening round , beginning with Darrin Nelson of Stanford , selected seventh over all . He was picked by the Minnesota Vikings , and not with his approval. // Nelson , a small , darting speedster , was acquired because Minnesota will be playing on artificial turf in a new indoor stadium . But he had expressed a desire to remain on the West Coast . After having been chosen , he said that he had specifically written the Vikings asking that they not draft him. // The Giants , selecting 18th , were able to draft the running back they wanted , Butch Woolfolk of Michigan . The Jets , 23d , also captured the first-round player they had sought , Bob Crable , the Notre Dame linebacker . Crable was the fourth linebacker to be drafted , after Cooks , Banks and Jimmy Williams of Nebraska , who was chosen by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Browns got their second new linebacker , after last week ' s acquisition of Tom Cousineau from Buffalo for three draft choices next year , one on each of the first three rounds. // Yesterday ' s less-predictable selections were Mike Quick , a wide receiver from North Carolina State , and Ron Hallstrom , a 290-pound guard from Iowa . Quick went to the Philadelphia Eagles , Hallstrom to Green Bay. // As expected , only two quarterbacks were chosen on the opening round - Schlichter and Jim McMahon of Brigham Young . McMahon , rated higher than Schlichter by many , went to the Chicago Bears as the fifth player chosen , right after Schlichter. // Players from Eastern colleges were largely absent from the first round . Mike Munchak , the Penn State guard , was chosen eighth over all by Houston . His teammate Sean Farrell , another guard , was selected by Tampa Bay , which had the 17th choice. // Despite the paucity of Easterners in the early going , eight Penn State players had been chosen by the end of the first day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , also with eight players chosen , could boast as many. // The draft , the 47th in the league ' s history , ends today with the final six rounds. //
