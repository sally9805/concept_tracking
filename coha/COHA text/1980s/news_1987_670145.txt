WASHINGTON  --  The House easily approved a $1 trillion budget plan , but apparently has bought itself controversy with a surprise provision that would mandate the diversion of some imported oil into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . The Democratic-controlled House yesterday voted 230-192 to adopt a budget blueprint that would raise $18 billion in taxes and cut projected military and nonmilitary spending nearly $9 billion each in fiscal 1988 , which begins Oct. 1 . A showdown with President Reagan is expected over the plan ' s budget priorities . Behind the scenes , however , another battle was brewing within Congress itself . The budget resolution contains a line that is likely to create a furor in the oil industry and between lawmakers from different regions of the country . The budget blueprint calls for savings of $684 million in fiscal 1988 from the filling of the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve through a so-called acquisition program . In practical terms , the program , which originated in the House Energy and Commerce Committee , would require oil companies to set aside about 2% of the oil they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reserve . The effect of the program is similar to imposing a small tax on imported oil , which has long been a controversial idea . A senior White House official said the plan looked like a backdoor approach to an import tax , which the president opposes . The budget document isn ' t binding , and the " acquisition program " hasn ' t been approved by the House  --  only the amount has . But Energy Committee Chairman John Dingell ( D. , Mich. ) said in an interview that he and other high-ranking members of the House Democratic leadership back the program , and it ' s up to Mr. Dingell ' s committee to come up with a way to achieve the saving . He referred to it as a " modest little petroleum-acquisition program . " The budget item , of which even some members of the House Budget Committee were unaware , was the topic of heated discussions among Democratic floor leaders in the House yesterday morning . Several lawmakers from the Northeast took the floor during the budget debate to decry an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget document . One of the most concerned was Chairman Dan Rostenkowski ( D. , Ill. ) of the House Ways and Means Committee , which has jurisdiction over taxes . He called his panel members together for a special meeting on the issue of the oil program ; several expressed concern that the program was fashioned as a way to get around the Ways and Means panel by imposing an import fee in commodities rather than in dollars . After the meeting , Rep. Rostenkowski took the floor to say he would oppose any oil-import fee that came to the House floor without first being routed through his committee . Some lawmakers and aides saw the imported-oil controversy as a prelude to a major clash between two of the most powerful committee chairmen in the House , Reps . Dingell and Rostenkowski , who have a history of disagreeing over jurisdiction . Also , the issue brought to the fore the question of imposing a tax on imported oil , a notion that is popular with lawmakers from Southwestern oil-producing states but is opposed by Northeastern lawmakers , who fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate Budget Committee ' s budget plan doesn ' t include a similar acquisition program for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve . But yesterday , Chairman Bennett Johnston ( D. , La. ) of the Senate Energy Committee and Chairman Lloyd Bentsen ( D. , Texas ) of the Senate Finance Committee introduced a bill that would impose an oil-import fee . The House Energy Committee ' s proposal wouldn ' t involve a fee . It would require oil companies to place a percentage of their oil imports into storage , but would allow them to retain ownership of it . If oil supplies were cut off , the companies would be allowed to sell the oil . They could retain the profit from any difference between the price they paid for it and the price at which it was sold . The committee proposal would mandate that the reserve be filled at the rate of 100 , 000 barrels a day , compared with the 35 , 000-a-barrel rate proposed by the Reagan administration . Currently , the U.S. pays for the oil it puts in the reserve . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who passed their budget in the House without Republican votes , are heading toward a confrontation with President Reagan , who opposes so large a tax increase and so deep a cut in military spending . The president yesterday called the House budget resolution " business as usual " by the Democrats , with tax increases and cuts in defense . Rep. Rostenkowski yesterday praised Speaker James Wright ( D. , Texas ) for taking the lead in urging a tax increase to reduce the budget deficit . Previously , Rep. Rostenkowski had been hesitant about seeking a tax increase without the president ' s backing . " Revenues have to be a part of our deficit solution , " he said . The Senate Budget Committee ' s plan makes similar choices , but hasn ' t yet passed the Senate . The budget resolution , once it is reconciled between the two chambers , is supposed to serve as a guide for budget decisions throughout the year . The plan passed by the House would reduce the deficit next fiscal year by about $38 billion , including about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but fails by congressional estimates to meet the $108 billion deficit limit imposed by the Gramm-Rudman law . Earlier , the House voted overwhelmingly , 394-27 , to reject the president ' s own budget proposal . Also rejected were a liberal budget plan , which contained a large tax increase , and a conservative plan , which contained a smaller one .
