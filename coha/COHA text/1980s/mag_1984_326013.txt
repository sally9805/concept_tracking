Nuclear mystery near Japan <P> For days a Soviet Golf II-class submarine zigzagged erratically across the strategic Sea of Japan . Occasionally the vessel would dive , resurface and send off clouds of heavy smoke , while support ships waited near by . Finally an oceangoing Soviet tug took the obviously stricken sub in hand and began towing it at a snail 's pace in the general direction of Vladivostok , headquarters of the Soviet Pacific Fleet . As the Japanese press closely followed the drama , defense officials in Tokyo quietly pondered a couple of minor mysteries : What was the warship , of a type capable of launching nuclear-tipped ballistic missiles , doing only 56 miles off Japan 's westerly Oki Island ? And what had gone wrong ?

The presence of that formidable force has made the Sea of Japan a hub of subsurface activity and , not coincidentally , the scene of a growing number of underwater accidents . Last week 's incident took place not far from where the U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk collided with a Soviet nuclear-powered submarine in March .
