Start with the palm trees  --  the king palms , windmill palms and date palms by the hundreds that grace the sprawling 8,200-acre campus . Beneath their gently waving fronds lie beds of fragrant star jasmine and flowering ice plant . Then there are those strapping , clean-cut young men and women , tossing Frisbees in the perpetual sunshine , lounging on the grass in cutoffs and T shirts , cycling along special bike lanes on their way to buy frozen yogurts ( " fro-yo , " to locals ) or to play a few sets of tennis . Finally , there are the buildings , the picturesque , mission-style structures with their red tile roofs and colonnaded sandstone facades . Could anything that looks this much like a country club be a serious academic institution ? It could if its name is the Leland Stanford Junior University of Palo Alto , California . <P> Founded 103 years ago on the grounds of Railroad Magnate Leland Stanford 's trotting-horse farm , the university is in the midst of a five-year centennial celebration that marks its rise from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher education . The ascension of this brash Western upstart has come as both a shock and a challenge to such Ivy League powerhouses as 352-year-old Harvard and 242-year-old Princeton , where the notion of academic endeavor is firmly associated with rigorous winters and a stern Puritan work ethic . Reflecting the early contempt heaped on Palo Alto by the Eastern establishment , one 19th century editorialist wrote that " Stanford 's great wealth can only be used to erect an empty shell . " <P> Some shell . Today Stanford is home to 1,200 faculty members and 13,300 students . Its faculty and staff include nine Nobel laureates , eleven National Medal of Science recipients , eight MacArthur Foundation Fellows and six Pulitzer prizewinners . Stanford students have won 59 Rhodes Scholarships and 27 Marshall Scholarships . Among the university 's illustrious alumni are Supreme Court Justices William Rehnquist , Anthony Kennedy and Sandra Day O'Connor ; Football Stars Jim Plunkett and John Elway ; Astronaut Sally Ride ; TV Commentator Ted Koppel and  --  would you believe ?  --  Harvard President Derek Bok . <P> The university 's professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific and technological breakthroughs . Stanford developed the world 's first X-ray microscope . The Stanford Medical Center was the site of the nation 's first adult heart transplant . Stanford research produced the basic patent on gene splicing and scores of other inventions that will net the university some $6 million in royalties this year . <P> Add to all that a high-powered athletic department , top-flight business , law and education schools and a respectable , if not quite superlative , humanities program , and you get major headaches for recruiters at rival institutions . Moans a Yale University admissions officer : " Stanford 's got everything  --  great climate , great physical plant , terrific extracurriculars and , increasingly , world-class academics . " No less impressed , Cornell University President Frank Rhodes declares , " Stanford is not simply a great national institution , but one of the world 's great institutions . " That collegial admiration was reflected last October in a U.S. News &; World Report survey in which university presidents were asked to choose the nation 's best colleges .
