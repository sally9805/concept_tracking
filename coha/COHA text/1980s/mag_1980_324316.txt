The mystery of Alvin Lee King <P> To dramatize his sermon against Communism last year , Minister Jim Powell had several uniformed men rush into the First Baptist Church in Daingerfield , Texas , and fire blank cartridges . Thus most of the 350 worshipers in the church last week thought it was just another example of play-acting when Alvin Lee King III , 46 , burst in as the congregation was singing More About Jesus . King was wearing Army fatigues , a flak jacket and helmet , and carrying an arsenal : an AR-15 rifle with a bayonet , an M-1 rifle , a pearl-handled .22-cal. pistol and a .38-cal. pistol . Slung over his shoulder was a pack stuffed with 250 rounds of ammunition . <P> " This is war ! " he shouted as he opened fire with the AR-15 . He killed five people , including a seven-year-old girl , and wounded eleven before fleeing to a nearby fire station . There he critically wounded himself with a shot in the forehead from the .22-cal. pistol . When policemen went to his isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they discovered his wife Gretchen bound to a kitchen chair with rope and telephone cord . On a table was a note : " Jeremiah says the King is the King of Kings . " In the basement , the officers found a letter from the Soviet embassy in Washington informing King that he could not become a Soviet citizen , plus records of about $300 deposited this spring in a Swiss bank and passports for King and his wife . Said Deputy Sheriff Emit Kennedy : " He definitely had something planned . " <P> But what ? No one could say . And , even more puzzling to the people of the northeast Texas farm town was Alvin Lee King himself . Raised in Corpus Christi by parents who owned a liquor store , pawnshop and jukebox leasing company , King came to Daingerfield in 1966 with Wife Gretchen , Daughter Cynthia and Son Alvin Lee King IV to teach high school math . That same year , while King was visiting his parents in Corpus Christi , he was examining a 12-gauge shotgun when it somehow discharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accidental . <P> At Daingerfield High School , King was considered brilliant but an oddball . He refused to sign an oath , required of all local teachers , acknowledging God . His teaching methods were somewhat bizarre . For instance , he let students whose marks fell between Bs and Cs cut a deck of cards to determine their final grade . In 1972 he quit rather than teach retarded students , then became a truck driver . <P> Five years later , his house burned down under mysterious circumstances , and King moved his family to the 100-acre farm , where he raised peas and cucumbers , collected guns and practiced judo . As far as most people in Daingerfield were concerned , the Kings had dropped from sight until Cynthia , 21 , showed up at the police station last October and complained that for ten years her father had been forcing her to have sex with him . She told the officers that she had finally decided to file charges of incest against him at the urging of a friend , Stanley Sinclair , 20 , son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stabbed to death in Houston . King , who was scheduled to go on trial for incest last week , asked several townspeople who happened to be members of the First Baptist Church to testify as character witnesses ; all refused .
