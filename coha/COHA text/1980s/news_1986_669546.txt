British Telecom remained impervious to repeated complaints from the public about inefficiency and bad service . Now , changes on an unprecedented scale have swept through British Telecom , leaving the company with a different face - leaner , more efficient , and more profitable. // This dramatic upheaval is the direct result of events that began in 1981 . About the time British Telecom was helping to transmit pictures of the wedding of Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer around the world , Prime Minister Thatcher ' s conservative government initiated a sweeping liberalization of the country ' s telecommunications industry. // // The upshot was a licensing of another company , Mercury Communications , to provide a nationwide network in direct competition with British Telecom. // Cutting government ties // Three years later , as part of an ongoing policy , the government privatized British Telecom , selling off the company to private shareholders and adding to the pressures for change. // ' ' The introduction of competition , the liberalization of the industry , and privatization have galvanized Telecom to expand and offer new services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips &; Drew , a British brokerage. // The primary catalyst has been Mercury Communications . Only a tiny fraction of British Telecom ' s size - with a market capitalization for its parent company , Cable and Wireless PLC ( C &; W ) , of ( STR ) 3. 5 billion ( $5 billion ) , compared with ( STR ) 11 billion ( $16 billion for British Telecom - Mercury has nonetheless emerged as a significant threat to the giant utility ' s share of the market. // ' ' Any competitor is obviously a challenge , ' ' says John Tysoe , an analyst at Kleinwort Grieveson , a British brokerage ; ' ' Mercury is something more than that . Under the terms of its license , it can target the single most profitable area of British Telecom . It can target the City ( London ' s financial district ) . // ' ' It doesn ' t have to provide services to the Isle of Skye or the Outer Hebrides , ' ' he continues . ' ' It can just do cream skimming. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the introduction of newer , advanced technology . In a company that is not weighed down by top-heavy bureaucracy , that has meant the ability to charge lower prices and undercut British Telecom. // Telecom has been hit hardest in the highly profitable sector of long-distance and international phone calls made in the financial community . This is where Mercury is not only offering cheaper rates but , because of its new equipment , better service. // ' ' British Telecom is making a lot of progress towards modernization , ' ' says Mr. Tysoe . ' ' There is no doubt it has accelerated plans to reduce long-distance rates and spend nearly ( STR ) 2 billion to overhaul its service , offering some new services not widely available six years ago . These include message handling and telephone answering facilities , electronic mail , and video conferencing. ' ' // Embracing new technology // British Telecom is fighting back , and in doing so has come a long way toward shedding its image as an ossified , obsolete giant. // British Telecom has also established a cellular radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up private branch exchanges with more than 100 extensions . And it ' s replacing the old analog system with new integrated digital exchanges , which can transmit both data and voice and provide customers with a fast connection and clearer speech. // In addition , British Telecom is converting its long-distance trunk network from conventional cables to optical fibers . These will improve line quality and facilitate transmission of data. // British Telecom is also pushing aggressively to expand overseas . It is competing directly with C &; W , Mercury ' s parent , to build and operate telephone networks in developing countries , long the stronghold of C &; W. // Earlier this year , it acquired Mitel Corporation , a Canadian maker of communications equipment . This is British Telecom ' s first manufacturing operation and provides it with a toehold in the United States and Canadian telecommunications market. // For average consumers , this more aggressive management style has had mixed results . New residential customers no longer have to wait nine months to get a phone installed , as they did six years ago. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is likely to be similar to what happened in the US when American Telephone &; Telegraph was broken up in 1984 . As subsidies from long-distance calls are eliminated , the cost of local calls could rise , although any increase is limited by government regulations . Customers will begin to pay for services like directory inquiries that are now free. // For the first time phone bills will be itemized . For what it says are technological reasons , Telecom has never customers ' itemized bills but plans to do so in the next decade. // Problems lingering // Despite its attempts at modernization , British Telecom still has serious problems. // Although its top management is considered progressive , it is overmanned and faces a difficult task slimming its work force of 236 , 000 employees . And it also must change the attitude of many who see themselves more as civil servants than as workers in a commercial organization. // ' ' Cultural change and head-count reduction are two of the biggest problems , ' ' says Harold Rich , an analyst at Capel-Cure Myers , a brokerage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there wasn ' t any idea of profit at British Telecom , and it tended to be overmanned. ' ' // British Telecom ' s drive to expand and improve has had a dramatic effect on the telecommunications industry in Britain . It has both distressed a number of its established suppliers and forced them to be more competitive with foreign companies. // ' ' The liberalization of telecommunications sent shock waves through the industry , ' ' says David Gibbons , an analyst at James Capel &; Co. , another British brokerage . ' ' It meant British Telecom was no longer a monopoly and accelerated foreign competition. ' ' // Despite the sweeping changes , there is still concern here about how British Telecom would fare under a Labour government , and these fears have been reflected in its that if its party gets into power , it might repossess British Telecom without allowing shareholders any profit , or it might give shareholders some form of an income bond in exchange for sacrificing their voting rights. // Despite this proclaimed policy , most analysts regard it as somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shareholders could create a lot of potentially disgruntled voters. // ' ' British Telecom has over a million small British shareholders , and this will not enhance Labour getting back into power if they think they are being ripped off by the Labour Party , ' ' Gibbons notes. // In the face of these difficulties , Telecom ' s prospects are still good , but quality of management is crucial. // ' ' It has an excellent future , but it comes down to the management , ' ' says G. Alan Horne , managing director of Interconnect Communications Ltd. , an information technology consultancy . ' ' British Telecom needs strong management at all levels. ' ' // //
