Infidelity in the movies , in all contemporary fiction , is seen as a mostly middle-class affliction . The other ranks may be portrayed as beery bigots or cheery peddlers of homely wisdom , and they may be permitted any form of luxury that can be purchased on the installment plan . But the indulgences that are paid for in painful scenes and sleepless nights are usually denied the working class . <P> Twice in a Lifetime would deserve respectful attention if all it did were redress that imbalance . But the story of how the 30-year marriage of Steelworker Harry Mackenzie ( Hackman in another solid performance ) and his wife Kate ( Ellen Burstyn ) sunders has another dimension . Scenarist Welland ( who wrote Chariots of Fire with another kind of class consciousness ) and Director Yorkin ( who created All in the Family with Norman Lear ) want to use the Mackenzies ' disorder to explore sympathetically an entirely unfashionable layer of life . <P> To the filmmakers , the disintegration of a marriage is not at all an occasion for faultfinding or for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lifetime is decent . Harry only reluctantly concedes the validity of his need for emotional renewal , and he never entirely forgives himself the pain he causes . He is , in fact , as surprised as anyone when , while celebrating his 50th birthday with his fellow mill hands , he falls passionately in love with a barmaid ( Ann-Margret ) . Stunned , Kate is tempted toward but fights off a state of permanent victimization . Helping her to remobilize are a married daughter ( Amy Madigan ) , who ferociously expresses the anger her mother represses , and a younger sibling ( Ally Sheedy ) , whose wedding , in suddenly straitened circumstances , requires some ingenuity from all three women . <P> Family dramas are always an invitation to fine ensemble acting , and these players are up to it . Hackman brings life to realism as effectively as he brings realism to fantasy in Target . Burstyn clarifies her character without oversimplifying . She finds both repose and luminosity in Kate . Madigan is not afraid to let the audience dislike her abrasiveness , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ann-Margret is somewhat shortchanged by the script : her motives are never made fully clear . Sometimes , too , the movie feels overly tidy and pleased with its own humanism . But it unashamedly keeps scratching away at small behavioral truths , and draws some blood in the process .  --  R.S.
