 | A decade ago , the dilemmas of the single woman and the newly divorced were hardly acknowledged in the millions of greetings produced by Hallmark Cards . Today , the company 's cards bear such messages as , " I just wanted you to know that my marriage has ended , " or , as both unmarried women and the Marines sometimes lament , " Still looking for a few good men . " Joining Hallmark are a growing number of companies that are courting the 21 million Americans who live alone . Increasing three times as fast as other households , single-person households have changed everything from what appears in the frozen-food sections of grocery stores to how Detroit designs cars . The perspective of these households is often shared by an additional 58 million singles who are unmarried , separated , widowed or divorced , but who do not live by themselves . The biggest challenge to manufacturers and retailers interested in the live-alone market is its diversity . Despite perceptions that singles are young and carefree , the group includes aging babyboomers who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never married and widowed older people . Among baby-boomers between ages 25 and 29 , 39 percent of the men have delayed marriage , while 26 percent of the women are still single ? big increases since 1970 for both sexes . More than 60 percent of those living alone are female , and more than half of such women are widows . Single men usually are considerably younger . Households of single persons span a vast income range : About half of the live-alones are middle-income earners , but 44 percent earn under $10,000 . Even more important to marketers are the change in how singles view themselves and the growth in the ranks of those delaying marriage or not marrying at all . " Single people do n't necessarily expect it to be a temporary state , " says Judith Langer , a market researcher in New York . The small , but important , slice of single-person households that are making more than $35,000 has a big appetite for houses , cars , china , crystal , home-entertainment equipment and other luxury items . " They are willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Faith Popcorn , president of BrainReserve , marketing consultants . Advertising executive Janine Linden , for example , lives in a two-bedroom apartment in Manhattan . She spends her upper-income salary on travel , a fashion-conscious wardrobe and imported antiques . " Next to earning money , my second favorite thing is spending it , " says Linden , who is 39 and divorced . The frozen-food industry was among the first to sense that people who live alone demand quality and " want more than TV dinners and V-8 in 6-ounce cans , " says Tony Adams , marketingresearch director for Campbell Soup Company . At Campbell 's , singles under 40 and " senior singles " over 65 are important markets . The type Campbell 's is trying to reach would include a single like George Shackelford , 30 , assistant curator of European art at the Museum of Fine Arts , Houston . Shackelford occasionally goes on a frozen-food binge but says , " I would rather spend money to go out to eat , even if I have to eat by myself . " When shopping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen premium entrees , which have rung up $260 million annually in sales since 1983 , microwave breakfasts , countless varieties of soups , and refrigerated fruit and vegetable salads . The company noted the popularity of supermarket salad bars and figured a prepackaged offering " would be a hot button , especially with singles , " says Adams . Corning Glass Works also tracked the trend toward more eating alone ? even within families ? and introduced Little Dishes ? small bowls , pans and casseroles that can be popped into a microwave . The line is particularly popular among the elderly because many do not cook in great quantity . Even in the automobile and real-estate industries , where change comes more slowly , there is recognition that single people have different tastes and needs . Car companies are making a special effort with the female buyer , who accounts for 42 percent of all auto purchases and often is single . Auto makers are training dealer personnel in how to handle female buyers , changing the angle of gas pedals to accommodate high heels , and devoting more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cougar was popular with females , it developed an ad with a woman in track shoes and the line , " You 'll love the shape you 're in . " Change in the showroom has come less quickly . " It 's like stepping into the world of 1955 , " says auto consultant John Schnapp . He points out that young , well-educated , independent women bristle with resentment when dealer personnel patronize them . For home builders , singles have become a critical challenge , since a quarter of firsttime buyers and 54 percent of condominium purchasers are single . " If it 's a yuppie single , they want a place to entertain and not just a place to sleep , " advises real-estate consultant Sanford Goodkin . " A divorced single has a different sociology . " Some builders have approached the market by tackling a specific subsegment . At Crestwood Village , Inc. , in New Jersey , marketing director David Wolff says his firm specializes in housing for older people approaching or arriving at retirement . Company research shows  | women who live alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security , services and social opportunities . Younger singles living alone in New York turn to companies such as Bellmarc Realty , which concentrates on selling studio units to singles under 40 making less than $75,000 . " They want a real home , not merely a rental , " says Neil Binder , one of the firm 's principals . Nancy Bennett , a 35-year-old Chicago lawyer , is interested in real estate for its investment value . She now owns a onebedroom condominium near Wrigley Field but is shopping for a larger place that she can rent out for extra income . Some lenders , such as Citicorp Savings in Chicago , are adjusting to the new realities by dropping the word spinster from mortgage applications and substituting single person never married . Many singles spend heavily on travel , entertainment and fitness ? industries where the single person has always been an important customer . A study of the singles market by the ad agency Young &; Rubicam showed that entertaining , membership in a group such as a health club and traveling are all part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as American Leisure Corporation , which designs and manages health clubs , to locate facilities in residential buildings with high concentrations of singles . A one-bedroom unit in New York can cost $200,000 , with extra fees for facilities . Entrepreneurs such as Jeffrey Ullman specialize in the ultimate singles service ? matchmaking . Ullman , president of Great Expectations Creative Management in Los Angeles , charges about $1,000 a membership for his video dating service , which he has franchised nationally . New Yorker Michael Hess sets up trade shows especially for singles where businesses push their wares . Harder to reach are single people over 40 , many of whom have found themselves spouseless because of death or divorce . Melvin Rowland , 54 , whose wife died five years ago , says he feels forgotten . " The only thing they are marketing to individuals are diet , exercise and glamour products , " he complains . But that may change as America 's singles population becomes older and more female . Elderly women , whose numbers are expected to rise twice as fast as the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live 20 more years on average . Men age 65 in the year 2000 can expect to live 16 more years . Business is taking note . Some of the elderly will not have large disposable incomes , but many will be freed from mortgages and tuition bills and begin spending on themselves . " Marketers traditionally have perceived them as old and dotty , but that 's not the case at all , " says Jeffrey Prupis of market researchers Yankelovich , Skelly &; White . Singles ' ranks may thin if baby-boomers finally take the plunge into marriage and the divorce rate continues to ebb . But the number of those living alone still will grow to 27 million by 1995 , and many will continue spending freely on themselves . " Everyone , to an extent , expresses their lifestyle through purchases , " says James Merrill , assistant professor of marketing at Indiana University . " But for singles , those outwardappearing things let everyone know where they stand ? like a badge . " WHERE THE LIVE-ALONES SPEND ALL THAT MONEY Premium lines of frozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier , top-of-the-line home furnishings and fitness equipment account for a substantial chunk of the more than $213 billion that single-person households spend each year . According to a recent survey by the Bureau of Labor Statistics , the average annual expenditure for live-alone households amounts to at least $11,469 , with $3,827 , or one third of the budget , going to mortgage or rental payments and other household expenses ; $2,046 for transportation costs , and $1,767 for groceries or eating out . Insurance and pensions take fourth place . Clothes , entertainment and personal-care products follow . Older singles make expenditures on health-care another big-ticket item .
