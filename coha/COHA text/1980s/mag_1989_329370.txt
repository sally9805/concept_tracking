At first glance , the slim volume with the red cover that found its way into the mailboxes of a few foreigners in Beijing last week read like one of the impassioned tracts circulated by Chinese students during their protests last spring . On closer scrutiny , however , the language was far harsher than anything the students ever wrote . Deng Xiaoping , the booklet charged , " is only an opportunist " whose " erroneous leadership " has betrayed " genuine Marxism-Leninism . " Unlike the students , who castigated Deng for not carrying reforms far enough , the book accuses him of hurtling mindlessly down " the capitalist road . " The solution : " Overthrow that handful of ambitious climbers and conspirators in the central party committee headed by Deng . " <P> China 's authorities have been quick to brand as " counterrevolutionaries " students and workers who voiced far subtler sentiments , shipping them off to jail , or worse . What was so intriguing about this book , published last May , was that its author was the official Communist Youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that copies were circulating more than three months after the massacre in Tiananmen Square . Youth League officials in Beijing claimed not to know anything about the tract 's origins , but they said the case was " under investigation . " Said a Western diplomat : " The language is strongly reminiscent of the Cultural Revolution . " If the booklet is genuine , he added , " it tends to confirm the view that a lot of attacks that appear to be aimed at ( ( ousted Communist Party leader ) ) Zhao Ziyang are in fact directed against Deng himself . " <P> Deng 's failure to make an appearance during the recent visit by the leader of Burkina Faso to Beijing has fueled new rumors that the 85-year-old Chinese leader is seriously ill . In the vacuum created by such uncertainty , conservative hard-liners who had been sidelined during a decade of economic reforms continued to stage a comeback . Among the most notorious : Maoist ideologue He Jingzhi , 65 , who was named Minister of Culture last week in the first top-level Cabinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party began last June . As deputy head of party propaganda , He played a key role in a 1987 conference of hard-liners who attempted to thwart the efforts of incoming Party Secretary Zhao to speed the pace of reforms . As Culture Minister , He replaces Wang Meng , a liberal-minded author who has not been seen since June . <P> The next victim , according to the Hong Kong press , is likely to be Zhao 's political ally Liang Xiang , governor of Hainan , China 's newest and most autonomous province . Liang was summoned to Beijing in late July to appear before a panel investigating allegations of corruption on the huge island in the South China Sea . In the governor 's absence , Hainan is reportedly being run by a Russian-educated vice governor with close ties to Zhao 's conservative , Soviet-trained rival , Premier Li Peng . Meanwhile , the ambitious plans that Deng and Zhao envisioned for Hainan 's economic development are on hold .                  @ @ @
