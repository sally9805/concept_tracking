Andrew Young ; Representatives John Lewis , Bill Gray , and Mike Espy ; Birmingham Mayor Richard Arrington ; and Fulton County ( Georgia ) Commissioner Michael Lomax . " These people all have been elected , " says Nunn , with an implicit swipe at Jackson , who has never held public office . " They have won something , held office , appealed to voters across the spectrum . " They are all DLC members , too , although Gray , a founding co-chairman of the group , makes it clear he wants no part of any ideological war with Jackson . He holds with those who say that Dukakis ran a bad campaign ? especially in the black community ? and asks why , if Southern white DLC leaders thought the party was fatally flawed , they did n't say so last July , before Dukakis got nominated . Gray says that instead of fighting with Jackson , the DLC ought to be building a network of local and national elected officials and developing " a unified policy for the 1990s " that can " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " The party has to have a debate about what it stands for and not paper over its differences . I do n't think that Jesse Jackson has to leave , or submit , but the party has to be straight about the fact that he represents a minority view , and has to disavow his extreme views . The battle is the mainstream versus the extreme . " From , Nunn , and others contend that the party can come together around " core values " that are different from the Republicans ' ? economic growth and upward mobility , equal opportunity and social justice , a strong defense and " citizenship , " which involves obligations owed by Ameri ? cans to the country . Part of the DLC 's task is to develop a series of " defining ideas " that exemplify those values , then sell them as the basis of a renewed , centrist party . National service ? a revived GI Bill for volunteers who serve in the armed forces or civilian community-service projects ? is currently the DLC 's major ideas initiative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary ? land have promoted it , and several bills will be introduced in the new Congress to put it into action , at an eventual net cost of $5.8 billion if 800,000 volunteers join up . From contends that national service embodies the values of upward mobility , opportunity , and citizenship , as con ? trasted with what he says are the Republican values of self-centeredness , greed , and , at best , noblesse oblige . Un ? der the DLC 's proposal , federal aid for college students would be available only in return for national service . Those who sign up would receive subsistence pay , plus vouchers worth $12,000 per year of service ( for soldiers ) or $10,000 ( for civilians ) to be applied to college tuition , job training , or a home down payment . Eventually , its initia ? tors hope , national service would foster a Kennedyesque ethos , such that young Americans would consider serving a natural part of their growing up . DLC officials thought that national service was an idea that could give a spark to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done for the 1984 Mondale campaign ? and might help Dukakis fend off attacks on his patriotism . Dukakis actually had a speech scheduled endorsing the idea , but it fell through . When Bush cameup with a pale imitation , called YES to America ( Youth Engaged in Service to America ) , Dukakis aides tried to get From to get Nunn to denounce the idea as Johnny-come ? lately stuff , but From refused . Finally Dukakis did en ? dorse the DLC plan ? on November 9 , in a postelection press conference . Other major DLC themes include using tax incentives to democratize the American workplace , encouraging corpo ? rations to give their employees reasons to improve produc ? tivity , and increasing civilian R &D; investment to make the economy more competitive . Instead of relying on free mar ? ket mechanisms , as the Republicans do , the DLC believes in the power of a **27;3159;TOOLONG " part ? nership " to improve competitiveness in key industries . The DLC has yet to recommend a macroeconomic policy to the party , but Nunn has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible energy-tax increase with pro ? ceeds dedicated to deficit-reduction , and a small capital-gains tax break rewarding only longer-term investments . Nunn also favors pushing the Federal Reserve into lower ? ing interest rates . But will he run in 1992 ? " It 's not some ? thing I 've decided on , " he says . Well , as the Democratic Party 's foremost expert on de ? fense and the leader of the Southern white boys , he ought to . And so should Bradley , the party 's expert on interna ? tional finances and debt . And Gore , the expert on environ ? ment and arms control . And maybe Bentsen , the one hero of the 1988 defeat . They represent the values that made the Democrats the majority party . And one of them actually could win . A WEEK BEFORE Election Day , George Bush Jr . chat ? ted over lunch at a ritzy Washington club with two conservative leaders , Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation and Robert Walker , a vice president of Coors Brewery . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency . The younger Bush sought to be reassuring . " George Bush to the conservatives will be like Richard Nixon in China , " he said . " You 'll be astounded at how conservatively he will govern . " Like his mentor Ronald Reagan , Bush wants to hold the support of the conservative movement . Unlike Reagan , he wo n't find it easy . Keeping conservatives on his side was a snap for Ronald Reagan . He hypnotized them . Reagan could do almost anything ? tax increases , summits with Mikhail Gorbachev , arms shipments to Iran ? without jeopardizing his conservative base . But Reagan was a prod ? uct of the conservative movement . Bush is n't . If he strays from the line too often , conservatives will revolt . This would n't doom the Bush presidency , but it would hurt . The last thing Bush wants is to emulate Jimmy Carter , who was opposed both by the opposition party and by the ideological base of his own party , liberals . It 's hard to govern in that situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right goes on . A week after his victory over Michael Dukakis , Bush dispatched Doug Wead , his full-time envoy to right-wing groups , to the meeting in Atlanta of the Council for National Policy . The council is not well known . Its sessions are closed to the press and it seeks no publicity . But CNP is important as an umbrella organization , bringing together the entire conser ? vative movement , including the Christian Right . Among its leaders are Weyrich , Edwin Feulner of the Heritage Foundation , Jerry Falwell , Pat Robertson , Nelson Bunker Hunt , and dozens of conservative businessmen . CNP is not a hotbed of Bush enthusiasts . Most of its members backed someone else , notably Robertson or Jack Kemp , for the Republican nomination . Wead , who played the role of Robertson in practice debates with Bush during the primaries , came with the message that conservatives should n't expect the world from Bush . From time to time , conservatives " will feel some shame and be embarrassed " over Bush 's decisions . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bush coalition reaches beyond conservatives . Still , Bush is a conservative , Wead insisted . He calls himself one , after all . He backed Reagan 's veto of the Civil Rights Restoration Act , a litmus test for conservatives , when none of his advisers " wanted him to do it . " He picked Dan Quayle as his running mate . " Who else would you have wanted who 's stronger or better ? " His speech at the Republican convention " hit all the buzzwords . " Earlier this year , Wead added , some conservatives were saying it would be fine to lose the presidency in 1988 " so we can come back in 1992 with a real conservative . If we 're going to indulge in situa ? tional ethics , we 're no better than our opponents . " Thank God , he said , that conservatives " woke up and got behind George Bush . " SOME ARE N'T too sure about Bush , though . The con ? servative movement has converts and skeptics . Feulner and the Heritage Foundation are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fervently . He expects Bush and his aides to give Heritage 's manifesto on what 's to be done in the next four years , called " Mandate for Leadership III , " a respectful reading . In the first week of the transition , he met with both Bush and James Baker , newly appointed as secretary of state . The head of Heri ? tage 's Washington Executive Bank , Lou Cordia , is also strongly pro-Bush . " The first three appointments to the administration , from a conservative standpoint , are great , " he said . " Baker will be far better than Shultz . Chase Unter ? meyer is great for the transition and White House per ? sonnel job . And Boyden Gray is great as White House counsel . The Bush administration will be as comparably conservative as the Reagan administration . " If that 's true , then Heritage 's job placement program should fare well in the Bush administration . Cordia has singled out 2,000 senior jobs at the White House , at the deputy assistant secretary level and above in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies . " These are jobs for which we 've conducted job searches . " He plans to give the Bush transition three to five names for each slot . This is much bigger than Heritage 's operation in 1980 , when it concentrated on fewer than 300 jobs . " We had people for which we were finding jobs then , not jobs for which we are finding people . " Cordia , who left the Environmental Pro ? tection Agency in the 1982 scandal , has high hopes for the Bush era. tics. and Congressman Newt Gingrich are skeptics . Weyrich , never a Reagan enthusiast , initially fig ? ured Bush would bring in " country club liberal Republicans who could n't wait for the end of the Reagan administra ? tion . " Bush 's sharp attacks on Dukakis on right-wing issues disabused him of that . Gingrich was impressed , too . " Every indication I have is that he 's far better than anybody in the conservative movement thought , " said Gingrich . " Now we 'll see . " In the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are not Bush 's movement . " The proper approach to the new administration is " co ? operative independence , " according to Weyrich . " If we are ever seen by Bush as blacks are by the Democratic Party , trotted out every four years , then we will be singularly unsuccessful . We have to make them the Bush crowd wonder if we 're going to remain with them . A group that is in the pocket of a politician gets ignored . " Since most conservative leaders did n't back Bush for the GOP nomi ? nation , Bush owes them little now , said Gingrich . " We ca n't say with a straight face to this guy , ' We created you . We sustained you . ' " Instead , conservatives should appeal to Bush 's " needs " ? to be re-elected , to have nice things said about him , to show up for an appearance " without being picketed . " In other words , they should play hardball . The Bushies , says Weyrich , " must satisfy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hands . " These concerns are many and specific . With Weyrich as their catalyst , a dozen Christian Right leaders , including Falwell and the president of the Southern Baptist Conven ? tion , sent Bush a telegram on November 12 on appoint ? ments . They wanted Congresswoman Lynn Martin denied the job of secretary of health and human services because she 's pro-choice on abortion . For the same reason they op ? posed both Governor Jim Thompson of Illinois and William Ruckelshaus as attorney general . Keep Richard Thorn ? burgh , they said . This was surprising since Thornburgh is no conservative . But it turns out he 's adopted the conserva ? tive position on abortion and has asked the Supreme Court to overturn the Roe v. Wade decision . Their thinking is that a moderate will be more persuasive arguing that position than would a new Edwin Meese . They also have been assured that Thornburgh will put a conservative in the job at Justice that they really care about , assistant attorney general for le ? gal policy . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renege on his promise of " no new taxes , " the worrisome issues for conservatives are the contras and Star Wars . The contras are a holy cause to conser ? vatives . If Bush does n't seek to renew arms shipments , re ? criminations will begin on the right . Bush is wary , of course , because the public does n't support the contras . One of his campaign polls found the public opposed to aiding the contras by 77 percent to 19 percent . Small wonder that he scarcely mentioned them in the campaign . As president-elect , he said the contras would be a " top priority " and that he would " keep on . . . reiterating my support for the free ? dom fighters . " This is hot air . What Bush wo n't say is what conservatives want him to : I will fight for more military aid for the contras . On Star Wars , Bush is equally fuzzy . In his press confer ? ence in Florida on November 14 , Bush said he 's given the Soviets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ty on Star Wars . His support for Star Wars , Bush said , " is not changing , not changeable . " That 's not quite the point . The Star Wars program , cut back by Congress , may dwin ? dle into irrelevance without a major presidential effort to revive it . It needs a champion to replace the one figure in the Reagan administration who truly believed in the pro ? gram , Reagan . If that 's what Bush has in mind , he 's got a funny way of showing it . He mentioned Star Wars spar ? ingly during the campaign . Willie Horton got more attention . Bush 's rhetoric on the contras and Star Wars is similar to Reagan 's on abortion and other social issues . It 's classic lip service . Sure , Bush means what he says . He does support the contras . But will he expend political capital on behalf of the contras ? That 's doubtful . Conservatives are tired of emotional rhetoric but no real effort . They want less rheto ? ric , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they 'll make a stink . And even the converts to Bush may join in . Almost every daily business section market wrap-up in the country cited Bush 's reiteration of his " no new taxes " pledge as the cause for the punishing sell-off . He 'd said it day in and day out for months before the election , but Wall Street was shocked ? shocked ? to discover that heplanned to continue saying it after the election . Without new taxes the budget deficit would not go away and we 'd be back in the same old bearish fix , the papers agreed . " If this is the market 's reaction to a Bush win , how bad would it have been if Dukakis had won ? " a puzzled market analyst asked after the election . The answer is that after an initial sell-off , the market could well have ended up con ? siderably higher . Wall Street traditionally prefers Republi ? can presidents on the theory that they are more sympa ? thetic to business . A Bush administration would seemingly portend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reagan 's pro-business orientation . Dukakis , on the other hand , had a broader social agenda that did not in ? clude lower capital gains taxes and broader business benefits . BUT WHEN A government becomes as dependent as we are upon foreigners , particularly the Japanese , to pay our deficit bills , the equation changes . The day after Election Day , the foreigners learned two things : they would have to continue to foot the deficit bill , courtesy of the no new taxes pledge , and ? here 's the kicker ? they would have to accept a much lower rate of return on their investment than they received under the paltry Reagan era . Martin Feldstein , known overseas as Bush 's real eco ? nomic adviser , gave the foreigners the bad news the day after the election when he gave a speech saying that the dollar would have to drop to 100 yen ( from its current 123 yen ) in order to rectify the trade imbalance . Feldstein 's cruzadation of the dollar is what really caused the sell-off as foreigners sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now turn into reality . The Japanese are n't stupid . They recognize that if the dollar is set to lose 20 percent of its value , and that billions more in U.S. government paper would soon flood the mar ? kets to pay for the deficit , selling existing holdings now is the best way to cut losses . So even though a Bush victory may appear on the surface to help business , it was the catalyst for rising interest rates and falling stocks , as for ? eigners fled our markets . Having made no silly no-tax pledge , and being open to the possibility of meaningful defense cuts , Dukakis could have moved swiftly to reduce the federal deficit . Stocks might have tumbled short-term , as Dukakis is no friend of business . But the far larger and more significant bond market would soon have exploded upward as foreigners realized that someone , at last , meant business about curing the deficit . Stocks would have followed , as lower interest rates led to more business and merger activity . There is nothing unique or new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wall Street has been saying for years now , just as Dukakis said in the campaign , that our prosperity is based too much on borrowing and that the federal deficit is the greatest threat to that prosperity 's continuation . And yet the Street supported Bush . Why ? Well , as my worried analyst friend reminded me : " Do n't forget we get paid no matter which direction the market goes , so better to elect the guy who takes
