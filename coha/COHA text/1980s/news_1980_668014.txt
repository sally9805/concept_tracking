If the Jan. 15 birthday of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr . is going to be a national holiday , a much stronger effort will be needed by advocates this year to keep the issue alive in a still adverse social climate . Although it is a holiday in 14 states , including Massachusetts , the nation as a whole is not yet willing to give the late civil rights leader this deserved tribute . This was apparent several weeks ago when the US House of Representatives voted down a bill that would have made it a national holiday . Opponents of the bill argued that a holiday on King ' s birthday would shut down the productivity of this country for one day . They also argued that it would cost the federal government $212 million in time off and overtime , not to mention additional costs by state and local governments . These arguments , of course , are full of holes . The Congressional Black Caucus noted that Germany and Japan have more holidays than the United States , yet have higher rates of productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened arguments came , unwittingly , from President Carter when he announced that Dec. 24 will be a holiday for the nation ' s 2.1 million federal employees . The US Office of Budget and Management estimated that such a day off would cost the federal government $200 million . Moreover , incumbent Presidents in the last two decades have made Dec. 24 a holiday for federal employees at least seven times . So much for a King holiday being too costly . There was also an effort by some members of the House to prevent King ' s birthday from being a holiday by turning it into a mere commemorative day . A coalition of Republicans and Southerners in Congress attempted to do this by substituting the holiday bill for one which would have honored King on a Sunday rather than a weekday . Realizing the coalition might have the necessary votes , the black caucus pulled the bill . Despite the Caucus ' unsuccessful effort last month , there are signs of hope for eventual passage of the holiday legislation . The Senate Judiciary Committee earlier passed the bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full Senate . The bill also has the backing of key legislators , who , in the words of one representative , feel that King " served uniquely to raise the moral consciousness of this nation . " The moral arguments for a King holiday have stronger foundations than the opponents ' reasons for resistance . As the black caucus argued , a vote for the bill would let the nation and the world know that " our great heroes come from all groups in this nation . " It also said that it would elevate this nation by bestowing the greatest national honor on the leader of those who have been denied true equality . Some would argue that although King , a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , is a major figure in our nation ' s history , he did not have the political status of the two Presidents who were honored with holidays , George Washington and Abraham Lincoln . They further would argue that the late President John F. Kennedy may be deserving of such an honor . These views might have merit , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evils that King fought against - bigotry , racism and hatred - would have prevented him from being a President . As for the world itself , it can be said that there might not have been as great a moral leader since Gandhi . There are also pragmatic reasons why the bill still has a chance . For example , white congressmen are being elected form districts with a growing black constituency and , as a result , are becoming more responsive to blacks in these districts . And during the House debate on the bill , the black caucus said only two representatives spoke out angrily against the bill . So far , it has been 11 years since the movement for a King holiday began in earnest . But considering that it took Congress 10 years to establish a holiday for Christopher Columbus , that is not such a long time . Moreover , the bill has grown stronger over the years . Despite the apparent strength of the bill after the tough congressional fight , it is still vulnerable to anti-King elements in our society . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s social atmosphere more conducive tothe bill ' s health . Only then will the bill have a chance to become ripe for congressional approval .
