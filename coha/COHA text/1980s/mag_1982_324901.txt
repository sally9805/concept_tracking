Are private sector ethics failing the Reaganauts in office ? <P> <P> It was a fine week for scandal buffs . On Tuesday , Labor Secretary Raymond Donovan denounced his principal accuser in a bribery investigation as a " damnable and contemptible liar , " and insisted that a special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the matter further . Next day the Justice Department announced that it was obliging Donovan , as , in fact , it had planned to do even before he spoke out . Within hours , Attorney General William French Smith closed down a separate inquiry into the affairs of Richard Allen , the White House National Security Adviser , with no finding of wrongdoing . Nonetheless , Allen remained on " administrative leave " while White House staffers debated whether or not he should return to office . <P> <P> Bulletins of this kind have become disturbingly common in recent months , despite the Administration 's affection for law-and-order rhetoric . Ronald Reagan speaks from his Middle American viscera when he says that lawlessness demands a " spiritual solution " and that retribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some degree the Administration is displaying a double standard . Reagan 's stern preachments , it is now clear , are aimed at murderers , rapists and pornographers . For white-collar violations of the law , there is understanding and forgiveness ; for the suspicion of impropriety , there is sympathetic patience . <P> One prominent example of this generous and benign attitude is Maurice Stans , 73 , the chief money raiser for Richard Nixon 's 1972 re-election campaign . Stans had pleaded guilty to five misdemeanor counts during the post-Watergate investigations of political fund abuses . Since Reagan assumed office , Stans has been quietly lobbying among his friends on Capitol Hill and in the Administration for some kind of symbolic rehabilitation . It took months for Deputy Chief of Staff Michael Deaver to find an appropriately obscure post for Stans , but find one he eventually did . In early December Stans was named to the board of the Overseas Private Investment Corp. , which insures private U.S. investment abroad . Explained one of Reagan 's top advisers : " The President felt that here was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , a decent man who had suffered a lot . " <P> Reagan 's compassion is commendable in principle but leaves at least one large question unanswered . Did he really intend to put the presidential seal of approval on the dubious tactics that typified fund raising during the 1972 campaign ? <P> <P> Similar questions arise about the appointment of Armand Hammer , chairman of Occidental Petroleum , as head of the President 's Cancer Panel . In 1975 , Hammer pleaded guilty to three misdemeanor charges involving improper contributions to the campaign fund administered by Stans . It was hardly a major matter , and Hammer is an esteemed U.S. business leader . But if the President wanted a successful corporate executive to chair this panel , surely there was someone available who had not openly confessed to illegal political activities .
