A joint session of Congress is the most august forum available to a President . The setting alone  --  the entire Government of the United States solemnly assembled in one vast chamber  --  imparts a majesty and a grandeur to the occasion . The maiden address to Congress by a new President adds a further element of anticipation and drama . For George Bush , in particular , last Thursday 's performance was the long awaited moment of self-definition , the chance to put to rest forever the stale gibes about his difficulties with " the vision thing . " <P> Those certainly were the expectations . Bush and his advisers had portrayed the three pleasant but slightly enervating weeks since the Inauguration as merely the interlude before the drum rolls heralding the formal presentation of his legislative program . White House aides talked confidently of the President 's " action agenda . " Bush had been predicting publicly that Congress would not like his courageous proposals , even as he artfully wooed legislators to ensure a warm reception . By the time the new President made his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a joyful alum at a Yale reunion , the stage was set for the programmatic speech that would boldly launch the Bush Administration . <P> By those inflated standards , Bush fell far short  --  and for want of a coherent message , an important opportunity was lost . Unlike the Inaugural Address , the speech contained no inspirational phrases , no soaring metaphors , just commonplace sentiments about how " we must take a strong America and make it even better . " This failure of rhetoric can be excused , for as the President said , now " it 's time to govern . " But governance requires agonizing choices , and Bush , like his mentor Ronald Reagan , stoutly declined to confront them publicly . The President 's program , as he defined it , is all gain and no pain , with scant need to explain the inherent contradictions . <P> In sharp contrast to Reagan 's stiff-necked philosophic rigidity , Bush was eager to touch every point on the ideological spectrum . He honored , with lip service at least , most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to halt offshore drilling in California to advocacy of extended health care for pregnant women and children . Bush courted environmentalists ( by pledging an end to acid rain and toxic dumping ) and borrowed lines from Jesse Jackson ( " Keep hope alive " ) , while still echoing themes from the Reagan years ( " growth and opportunity " and " family and faith " ) and bowing at the shrine of a balanced-budget amendment . <P> But instead of clear priorities , the President offered a clutter of programs , almost all marginal adjustments in the status quo . By awkwardly trying to match the concerns of a liberal Democrat with the means of a parsimonious Republican , Bush ended up with an incoherent philosophy that might be dubbed Reaganomics with a human face .
