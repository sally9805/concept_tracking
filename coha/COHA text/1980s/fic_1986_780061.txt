 | behind the cluttered desk , but for once , he was not even trying to interrupt as Mather continued to instruct him . Vintar 's face was mottled with suppressed rage , his thin hands clenched rigidly at his sides , and Wallis had no doubt that a medscan would confirm an elevated blood pressure , too . " Mister Vintar , we 've been over this so many times , I should think that by now you 'd know it all by heart , " Mather Seton was saying in his low , quiet voice . " You ca n't still be questioning my authority . You verified it yourself before I had the Valkyrie diverted . Now , are you going to cooperate , or must I resort to more drastic measures that we both may regret later on ? " He did not look in her direction as she entered the room , but Wallis knew that he was aware of her presence as she slipped behind him to stand at his back . Outwardly , at least , Mather was as calm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval fatigues . The insignia of a fleet commodore glittered on his shoulders and open collar , the crescent and trident patch of personal service to the Imperial House showing red and gold above the cuff of his right sleeve . The image conveyed was one of quiet control and competence , of unmistakable authority  --  which was , in fact , almost unlimited . That Irvin Vintar had continued to resist that authority for two full days , hindering their mission , was an unnecessary distraction . Wallis could see Mather 's growing impatience in the slight taptapping of his right thumb against the desk top , even though he seemed to be at ease in his chair . " Well , Mister Vintar ? I 'm waiting for your answer . " Vintar swallowed , desperate eyes darting here and there , even at Wallis , searching anywhere for an escape . " I ca n't do it , Commodore , " he finally said . " It 's too dangerous . Bringing the shuttle ship as close to the terminal as you want it is  --  no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this facility in a maneuver that is beyond  | our capability .

" " Bret ? " Vintar opened and closed his mouth several times nm the full implications of Mather 's suggestion finally registered . " " That 's out of the question , " he whispered . " I cot r1 c 1 n't possibly ? " " Mister Vintar , I do n't think I 'm really interested unvnrore in what you can or can not do , " Mather intern rlrtcd impatiently . " But , you 're not qua  --  I mean ? " " Mister Vintar , are you saying that a fleet commodore in the Imperial Navy is not qualified to land a civilian shuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wallis noted , that he was officially retired Irccrrr that service , at least .

" Vintar swallowed again , his eyes flicking involunt a r i ly clown Mather 's ample frame to the commodore 's Mirccrrlcler boards , to the Imperial Staff emblem , then to the slight bulge of a needler beneath his fatigue jacket , 1111 ( 1 hack to his face . The man 's jaw tightened with the rli ( crt of biting back further argument , but it was fairly obvious that Irvin Vintar had reached the end of his rrsou rces . Wallis could almost feel the man 's loathing . " Very well , Commodore . " He made a stiff little bow that ill concealed his anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full liability for any injuries or damage  --  and I want that in writing . "  | " That was understood from the beginning . " As Vintar stalked out of the office , Mather heaved a heavy sigh , then glanced up and behind him at Wallis , giving her a grin of rare maliciousness  --  lost , fortunately , on the back of the retreating Vintar . " Well , the bureaucratic bear has been wrestled and apparently bested , at least for the present , " he said lightly , getting to his feet . " Now all we have to do is see whether I can deliver what I threatened . It 's been a while . Is our cargo ready to load ? " Wallis , standing more than a head shorter than her husband , looked up at him with a slow grin to match his own . " Well , my problems were only bear cubs compared to yours  --  nasty ones , I 'll concede  --  but , yes , I got 12 things straightened out  --  I think . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water that should have been made available gratis ? " " His Imperial Majesty will be suitably appalled , I 'm sure , " Mather said , " though I suppose it 's all reckoned as a part of the price of peace , in the end . " He glanced out the plasteel viewing port that overlooked the BGem spaceport . The chromcrete of the landing apron stretched on for heat-shimmered miles . " Well , Vintar said that the Valkyrie was due to make orbit about twenty minutes ago , so I suppose the shuttle ought to be here in another ten . Care to come and watch me bring her in ? " Wallis grimaced and shook her head . " No , I think I 'll watch it directly . If you should put that thing down on our cargo instead of on the pad , I think I 'd just as soon go up with the wreckage . " " Why , Doctor Hamilton , do you doubt my abilities ? " " Why , Commodore Seton , how could you even think such a thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded when Wallis returned . Starliners the size and reputation of Valkyrie rarely made unscheduled stops ,  | r ? pecially at planets as far removed from the normal hhipping lanes as Beta-Geminorum III , and the event had prompted a number of travelers to alter their plans and book immediate passage . The fax board at the fait r.cnce to the passenger lounge read : " The Gruening I.tnc are pleased to announce the stopover of their Nttv:r-class luxury liner Valkyrie ... , " and went on to detail pertinent factors of cost , availability of accomIn rc l r t ions , and further flight schedules . Wallis suppressed a chuckle as she worked her way ht c , r rgh the throng , wondering whether any of the two ito/rrt waiting passengers suspected just how " pleased " Ilac Gruening folk were , in fact . George Lutobo , the VValktirie 's captain , had not been pleased . The Valkyrie had been engaged in a precision sprint from Tejat to 13 Alrrc ! ra , attempting  --  and about to establish  --  a new record for passenger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mather Seton did have the force of the Inrlxrrial government behind him , Lutobo was not at all pleased at having to abort that record-breaking run at Id change course for Beta-Geminorum III . The inhabitants did not call it that , of course . They called it B-Gem , if they did not call it Pollox III ; and an earlier race , already dying out when the first Earther colonists arrived with disease organisms that finished Ihr job , had called the planet Il Nuadi  --  a name that recently had begun to come into vogue again . Following the deadly Cruaxi Sweep , which had decimated lit titian civilization throughout the known galaxy some three hundred years ago , B-Gem had been isolated for generations . The first recontact by an expedition of the Orion Cartel a quarter century ago had found a rich , verdant planet peopled by hardy folk of exceptional agricultural ability , well ready to resume a place in an In tr.rgalactic Empire . And because B-Gem had started out as a company planet this second time around , carefully managed to : mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future , it remained relatively unspoiled . A young planet , far less developed than the world that had spawned humankind , B-Gem quickly became a magnet to zoologists and botanists from all over the Empire : an untouched wilderness of flora and fauna never catalogued before . And because an alien civilization had overlapped briefly with the arrival of the first humans , it also afforded an unprecedented opportunity for anthropologists and archaeologists . But it was B-Gem 's wilderness that remained one of the single , most attractive features for laymen . Here were vast areas of uncharted wilderness , jungles , and wilding canyons where man had never been before . And animal life : so wild , so bounteous , that in some areas , hunting expeditions were still permitted under almost unregulated conditions . Here was the opportunity to bag the trophy of a lifetime . Interests of this sort had brought Mather Seton and Wallis Hamilton to B-Gem , though Mather 's intelligence background and Wallis 's medical training also qualified them for more esoteric pursuits than hunting exotic game . Except that they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specific hunting expedition , for game that must be brought back alive . Their quarry had been the fierce and elusive blue creatures called Lehr cats , of which hitherto only two had been in captivity , and those in the emperor 's own menagerie . Now four more of the creatures prowled the confines of separate plasteel cages in the cargo area adjoining passengers reception , their eerie cries setting chills on the hearts of those who heard them , whenever the connecting door opened between the two holding areas . Rather than mere zoological curiosities , these particular cats had become unwitting pawns in a game of intergalactic treaty talks : sweeteners for the proposal that an alien ambassador would take back to his planet-hungry masters . They had cost several lives already .  | " Doctor Hamilton ? " Wallis raised a hand in acknowledgment of the g Ranger lieutenant who called to her as she red the holding area . His dark green coverall was prc  --  c able , as usual , but his thin face mirrored the I$J tie and tension under which all of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks since coming to B-Gem . From Ihr ut her side of a glassite wall behind him , the four Lela cats glowered in their cages , their jaws parting prticul-cally in what would be ear-splitting screams 11111 ) 111 the insulation of the wall . " What is it , Wing ? " The young man glanced beyond her at the passenrM I r - the lounge outside , some of whom stared back Mr r lien sympathy with the demonstrators massed ' aide the spaceport gates , then beckoned her closer he hacked toward the door leading to the cats . Slight td wiry in the manner of his Asian forbears , still he ( I to look down at the diminutive Wallis . " ' I'l-r cats are getting awfully restless , Doctor . I still ( you ought to have a look . " Ile slapped the door activator , and the increased Wrirrrne of the cats ' screaming assailed them as soon as Ihr door began sliding back . As Wallis and Wing enWed , two Imperial Rangers snapped to attention , neediet carbines slung over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four more roamed among Ihr piles of equipment surrounding the cages . " You see what I mean ? " Wing had to raise his voice to be ! ward above the racket of the cats ' howling . " They Slur t c  --  c I - rp right after you left to find Commodore Setoll . " " I ir  --  - nin , maybe they missed me , " Wallis said with a Wry smile , as she unsnapped a medscan pickup from her belt and held it closer to the nearest cage . " No one olr-rr-gr has been in there , have they ? " " Are you kidding , Doctor ? " Our own people do n't even want to be in here , with that caterwauling going  | on . My head feels like it 's going to split right open . " She swung the medscan briefly in his direction , trying not to grin , then returned her attention to the cats . " Take a headache tablet , Lieutenant . " " Thank you , Doctor , for that helpful advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wallis had no doubt about that . The male they called Sebastian bristled and spat when she leaned too close , his enormous ruff rippling like an electric-blue dandelion around huge golden eyes . Slender whiskers jutted from his cheeks like sapphire soda straws , quivering each time he roared . Wallis jumped back in reflex as the smaller female in the next cage suddenly leaped against the plasteel mesh and tried to bat at her with a melonsized paw . " Hey , easy , Emmaline ! Have you forgotten Mama ? " She got only a snarl for an answer . Unfortunately , Wallis suspected she already knew what the problem was  --  and there was nothing she could do about it for now . Ordinarily , the four cages were interconnected , end-to-end , allowing the cats access to the full length of the combined run and to one another . But just an hour ago , because of the imminent arrival of the Valkyrie 's shuttle , Wallis had ordered the Rangers to break down the cage system into four separate compartments again , for ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one another , in their usual configuration , but double plasteel divider panels now locked each cat into a separate compartment . It was necessary , of course , but the cats could hardly be expected to understand why . " Maybe they just do n't like being separated , " Wing said , as Wallis consulted her scanner again . " Oh , that 's certainly a part of it , " she replied . " And the 're frightened . Of course , they 're a little hungry , too , but there is n't a lot we can do about that , either , until we 've moved them aboard the Valkyrie . They ought to  | ti iInr down , once they 're back together and fed . " " I tire hope you 're right , Doctor , " Wing murmured , Pinking a notation on a tally board . " It 's too bad we Carr t tranquilize them . " As one of the females shrieked again on an even higher frequency than before , Wallis could hardly disSarrr with Wing 's observation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were very sensitive to most medications . They had killed two with inadvertent pveuloses before discovering that the drug used in Standard needler charges was several times stronger , than it needed to be : Even using the low-dose needles fiat all of them now carried , they had almost lost ItIutccll ) h , the smaller of the two surviving males . And how the cats would react to unmedicated hy- 17 rapac  --  e jumps was anybody 's guess , though she and ' her made unmedicated jumps all the time without effect  --  or at least she did . The cats simply would yr to take their chances , for the standard jump Medication was particularly toxic to them . Not for the first time on this trip , however , Wallis almost wished she were a veterinarian rather than a physician . Not that anyone else from off-world knew mini ) more about Lehr cats than she did . Presumably , the Iolk of Il Nuadi knew , since they had been living wit i c the animals for several hundred years ; but such Sinologists as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the cats strictly alone , relegating them to a complicated legend-taboo-myth cycle t hat forbade any interference with the creatures . That was what had drawn the crowd camped outside the spaceport gates and had nearly provoked a global Incident when they brought the cats here after captitle . A deep rumble vibrated through the entire chamber , more felt than heard , followed by a jarring shake wnct t hen total silence . The cats were quiet for all of five Seconds before taking up their wailing with renewed  | vigor . " That has to be the shuttle ship , " Wing said , rushing toward a darkened viewport where another Ranger was already hitting the polarizing controls . " The pilot must have set it down right on the roof ! " The wall went slightly transparent  --  clear enough to see the sleek , streamlined bulk of the shuttle ship now resting hardly twenty meters beyond , elegant and stylish in the murrey and silver livery colors of the Gruening Line . " Well , well , Susmen Limited 's latest model , " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it ? " " Aye , she 's a beauty , " Wing agreed , after a low whistle between his teeth . " I did n't know Gruening had such hotshot pilots , either . " Wallis had to try very hard not to laugh at the younger man 's exuberance . He was the youngest of all their surviving Rangers  --  almost young enough to be her son  --  and still very green . " They do n't , " she said with a grin , " though I suspect Mather would be flattered at the compliment . He might just have landed it on the roof , too , if he 'd thought it would support the weight . That way , we would n't have to take the cats outside at all . " " Commodore Seton landed it ? " Wing gasped , though the older Ranger only nodded knowingly . " And he must have done it by remote , too , " Wing went on . " I 'd heard he was a crack pilot before they made him retire , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Academy . " " But you can believe some of them , " Wallis murmured , almost to herself , as she hid a smile behind her hand and watched the ground grew already undogging the hatches , preparing for passenger and cargo boarding . Aboard the Valkyrie an hour later , the return of the shuttle ship from planetside met with a variety of  | reactions , depending upon whether one was a passenger or a member of the crew . For the crew , it was hardly a matter for rejoicing , since the change in schedule had cost them the bonuses promised if the Valkyrie 's *peed sprint had been successful . Few passengers really minded , however , for the ui irxpected stop at B-Gem provided a welcome break in the monotony of long-distance space flight , even aboard a great luxury liner like the Valkyrie . Taking on new passengers and exotic cargoes was one of the highlights of any long trip , and an unscheduled stop at one of the Empire 's outer worlds was almost guaranteed to pique the interest of even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gruening Line blind to this fascination . Long in the business of catering to the wishes of a wealthy and sometimes eccentric clientele , Gruening had provided an observation deck , *hove the shuttle bays , where interested passengers could watch the docking operations from behind safety ports and not get in the way of the crew . Less active passengers could even observe from the privacy of their Cabins , via closed-circuit viewers . The ship 's recreation computer correlated fifteen video channels , several having to do with routine operation of the ship , plus a wealth of library functions designed to amuse and Inform . I fence , the observation deck had attracted more than a dozen passengers for the B-Gem rendezvous . More might have come , but the ship 's day had begun only an hour before , and many were still asleep in their berths . A handful of adults watched with casual intercat. a few exotically clad aliens among them , but it was the children who had turned out in full force  --  who always seemed to know when a docking would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide  - -  eyed , clung to the railings behind the observation ports this morning ; they obviously itched to go down  | on the loading docks for a closer look at the shuttle , the new passengers , and any interesting-looking cargo that might be coming aboard . The new passengers disembarked first , each individual or party being met by a steward who conducted them to the purser 's check-in , just inside the passenger reception lounge . The Valkyrie 's captain was also on hand to greet the passengers , though his motives were less of sociability than of vexed curiosity as he waited for the other passengers , one in particular , who had virtually commandeered his vessel . A man of impeccable abilities , and humors as dark as his handsome face , Captain George Lutobo was not likely to dismiss lightly the fact that he had been forced to mar the Gruening Line 's reputation for precision scheduling  --  his mood was becoming darker by the minute . When a break came in the line of passengers waiting to check in with the purser , Lutobo drifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to snap at a baggage handler bringing down expensive-looking luggage . " One break in the normal routine , and the whole operation falls apart , " he grumbled , pacing back toward the purser . " Mister Diaz , what is going on ? " The bleat of an all-clear signal in the adjoining bay drowned out his words , and Lutobo realized that the man could not have heard him . Diaz had piles of customs declarations , visas , passports , and other travel documents all over his desk , in an order that apparently made sense to him but probably not to anyone else . He was presently logging in a med chip for a family of three , asking the usual questions about any special requirements of diet or preferred environment . " Mister Diaz , " the captain repeated . Diaz glanced up , nodding slightly as he saw that it was the captain . " Good morning , Captain . How can I help you ? " The captain tried unsuccessfully to control a scowl . " This Commodore Seton  --  has he come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir . I think he and his people are still M-Illi their cargo . Someone brought their papers , lough . ? ? W i t h a grudging nod , the captain picked up the tit of passports and shuffled through them until he : Id what he was looking for : Seton , Mather V. ; Fleet mmodore , Imperial Navy ( Ret . ) ; Ph.D . linguistics , Ilrliu'logy ; clearance 1-A-1 . The passport itself bore a Codicil endorsed by Prince Cedric , the brother of the Sinprror , guaranteeing a credit line whose upper limit emu- not even specified , though Lutobo knew that the axle letter after it would return an astronomical figure If he ran a credit check . .1 i t obo harrumphed at that , glaring at the " retired " Dotal ion and glaring more at the 1-A-1 clearance , then topped the stack of passports back on the purser 's Mk and strode purposefully toward the shuttle ship Ie  --  I1 . As he reached the foot of the ramp , two Imperial tigers in dark green coveralls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guiding an anti-gray dolly clamped under a bilge 1'lasteel container . A vaguely Oriental-looking yne i t ge r Ranger with a tally board followed them , actr- , i ' I ' . ' i I i ed by a tiny , titian-haired woman who could 111ve been almost any age from twenty on up . Lutobo lacl gone partway up the ramp to meet them before he Made out what was inside the mesh-sided container Mal hastily backed down again . " Coming through , Captain , " one of the Rangers lied . The animal was curled into a tight , furry blue ball , at It still seemed to fill the cage . Lutobo guessed it InlglIt weigh close to two hundred pounds under standard gravity , but just now it was bobbing , nearly Weightless , from the anti-gray dolly supporting its 1ptwge ? . The cage lurched a little as its handlers tried to Note it carefully off the end of the ramp , and the change Of angle produced a cry  --  somewhere between a screech end the sound of metal being shredded  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bristling , spitting bundle of enormous blue cat . It was maned like an Earther lion around angry golden eyes , with pointy ears flattened to a skull suggesting extreme cunning . It lashed more than a meter of tufted tail hard enough against the side of the cage to make the cage and dolly rock , as it hooked razor-sharp claws into the floor mesh to catch its footing . The creature yowled again , blinking in the harsh light of the dock , and the sound sent a shiver up Lutobo 's spine . The light also glinted off wicked-looking fangs , just before the creature closed its mouth . The captain gulped , suddenly breathing hard , and backed off further as the cage passed , surreptitiously wiping clammy palms on the sides of his maroon uniform trousers  --  he had never liked cats of any sort ? then resumed his previous scowl as a large , heavyset man in gray fatigues came down the ramp and started to join the others . Fleet commodore 's insignia gleamed on his collar tabs , and the Imperial cipher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breast pocket identified him as the very man the captain had been looking for . " Commodore Seton , I believe ? " Mather turned to appraise the captain , a bland expression on his round , pleasant face . " Yes , I 'm Seton . You must be Captain Lutobo . I 'm sorry we had to commandeer your vessel , Captain , but as I explained , we 're acting under direct Imperial orders . " He stuck out his hand in the captain 's direction , but Lutobo pointedly ignored it . " You said that you were on urgent Imperial business , " Lutobo said in a cold voice . " You implied that it was a matter of the utmost urgency . You did not say that it was to transport specimens for the Emperor 's zoo ! I do n't know whether it 's occurred to you or not , Commodore , or whether you even care , but the Gruen- Mg Line has a reputation to maintain . It can not do that if officious Imperial procurers interrupt its schedtcics for frivolous purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outburst , and now he tucked his thumbs casually into the waistband of his trousers . Though the movement did not appear to be obviously calculated , it did draw the fabric of his jacket more closely against his side , outlining with frank clarity the butt of the needier he wore beneath his left arm . Beneath a shock of light brown hair trimmed slightly longer than military regulations prescribed , the hazel eyes were clear of any menace ; the voice was calm and carefully neutral , but the promise of cold power was there , nonetheless . " I hardly think that you 're in a position to judge 23 whether the emperor 's whims ' are frivolous , ' Captain , " Mat her said quietly . " And while less flexible men than myself might feel obliged to take offense at your implied insult , I 'm sure you reacted out of genuine concern for your own duties , just as I am trying to be faithful to mine . I assure you that my people and I will do everything within our power to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unscheduled stop . " I , utobo blinked , taken aback by Mather 's mild yet unmistakably firm reponse , and folded his hands behind his back , drawing himself up straighter . " I apologize if I spoke a little hastily , Commodore , " he conceded . " However , I 'm afraid there 's nothing you can do to make up for the delay . Aside from the fact t h a t we 've already lost our chance at the new speed record this time out and my crew will forfeit their t ) o e l e tses , I can not risk my passengers ' comfort by making extra jumps , or by making scheduled ones too close together . The Gruening Line 's reputation is built even more on passenger safety and comfort than it is on punctuality . My superiors would not support any act ion that endangered this reputation . " Mather spread his hands in a conciliatory gesture .  | " I understand perfectly , Captain . However , it may be that I can assist your navigation staff to fine-tune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you your record , but we might at least make up for some of the lost time that way . I  --  ah  --  have some acquaintance with the Margall-Seton drive . " " I appreciate the offer , Commodore , but  --  wait a minute ! You are n't that Seton , are you ? " Lutobo blurted . Mather grinned . " No , but my aunt was . Seriously , Captain , I 'd like to help , if you 'll let me . " " Well , maybe we could manage to ? " But before he could say just what they might be able to manage , he was interrupted by one of the purser 's yeomen , who came hurrying into his line of sight with a look of concern on her usually controlled face . " Captain , there 's been a disturbance up on the observation deck . " She glanced over her shoulder , with both men 's eyes automatically following the direction of her glance . " One of the passengers went into some kind of hysterical fit and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers upset in the process , and the deck officer had to close the observation level . " " What about the passenger ? " Lutobo asked . " Is he all right ? " " That I could n't tell you , sir . It was one of the Aludran pilgrims . You know how private they are . His mate apparently took him in charge and they went back to their cabin , but someone from Medical Section probably ought to check on him . One of the other passengers said the Aludran was screaming something about demons . " " Demons ? " Lutobo said . " He probably saw one of my cats , " Mather muttered under his breath . " As I recall , Aludran demons are green rather than blue , but other than that , they do look rather a lot like Lehr cats . "  | Lutobo sighed . " I could have gone all day without Bring that , Commodore . " " Sorry , Captain . " Li c t obo shook his head wearily and rubbed at the i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to continue our pt-vctsation at a later time , I suppose . Will you excuse ft ? .. " Of course , Captain . " As Mather turned to go back up the ramp , where -  --  tore Rangers were bringing along the next cage , Iitotxo followed the yeoman back to the purser 's desk . " Mister Diaz , how many Aludrans do we have ** , this trip ? " ' 1't-c purser pushed a last folder onto the pile he had urn building and shook his head . " Only five or six , sir . Id you want a list of names ? " ' t'ttc captain snorted softly under his breath , then hx , k his head as well . " Never mind . I 'll have Doctor u  --  - ion do it . I was going to stop by Medical Section nyw : -y . This whole morning has given me a splitting eattache . " " Sorry to hear that , sir . " The purser raised a hopeful yrbrow . " But if you 're going to Medical Section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Mtirttgers ? Doctor Shannon will want to get them tirgr:tted into the files as soon as possible . " WI t l- a shrug and a gesture of futility , Lutobo picked p t t-c stack of chip cards that were the medical re ) nIs and sighed , then began to make his way across tr shuttle bay toward the crew lift . Behind him , ( ut I irr Seton watched his Rangers float a third cat NKr down the ramp of the shuttle ship , its occupant rrsuning with a sound like ripping metal .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " You might , " Shannon said lightly , taking advantage of his weightless condition to propell him gently in the direction of the door , " but I 'm afraid it 's only a briefly useful talent . You 'll have new legs again before you know it . Seriously , though , if you exert yourself too much , your painkiller is n't going to last the full twelve hours , and you 'll be hurting until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , and try to stay reasonably quiet . " " Spoilsport ! " " Yes , I know . I 'm a cruel , heartless doctor , with absolutely no sympathy for a gallant war hero . Goodbye , Major . " " ' Bye , Doc . " Shannon was still smiling as the major floated off down the corridor , and the twinkle in her eyes softened even Lutobo 's dour expression as he approached from the other direction . " You 're awfully cheerful this morning , Doctor . " " Well , it helps the patients feel better , Captain . Ah , I see that Mister Diaz has conned you into bringing me the records on the new passengers , has n't he ? " Lutobo snorted good-naturedly as he handed them over . " Somehow , I always manage to forget that Diaz has as much blarney in his blood as you do  --  though you 'd never know it by the name . At least yours got Major Barding smiling this morning . " " Indeed , it did . He 's even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She dropped the handful of medical chips into a holding bin on the reception desk and started to ask why Lutobo was n't smiling , but decided to stick with the more neutral subject of Barding as the captain gestured toward her inner office with an expression that warned against further levity . " Actually , Barding 's doing pretty well  --  if he 'd just stop overdoing things , so his pain medication would last the full time . The poor man goes through hell the  | Writ hour or so . " " And I 'm going through my own hell right now , Doctor , " Lutobo muttered , following her into the office and closing the door . " What have you got for a good , poi icding headache ? " " Well , good ' and pounding ' are rather diametrically opposed when talking about a headache , " Shannon sold , sitting at her desk and opening a drawer . Controlling a smile , she added , " But then , I suppose that defends a lot on what caused it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it across to Lutobo , who gulped it gratefully before sitting down . " Do you want to tell me about it ? " she asked . Closing his eyes , Lutobo rubbed both hands hard 31 ross his face and sat back in the chair . " Do you know what the special ' cargo was , the ason we diverted to B-Gem ? " " I 'm sure I do n't , Captain . " " It was cats ! " Lutobo 's tone conveyed all the contempt of the avowed ailurophobe . " Four big , hairy blue is kw the emperor 's zoo . They scream like banshees. do n't know how Diaz and his people were managing to conduct business down there . Ugly-looking brutes ? *1w cats , that is . " As I , utobo looked up at her again , Shannon raised eyebrow . " Cats , eh ? " She started to chuckle but saw the riling gleam in Lutobo 's eyes in time and managed convert the chuckle to a cough . " Well , I  --  ah  --  can fleterstand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of time , have n't we ? In addition to the bonus pay . " " Yes . And then , to top it off , there was some kind of IMtllrbance on the observation deck . According to a oHnan , who got it from the purser , who got it from the ck officer , one of the Aludran passengers got hysteriCal , apparently over the sight of the cats being unloaded , and made enough of a scene that the deck had  | to be shut down . There was some talk of demons or some such nonsense . I 'd like you to check it out . " " The Aludran ? " Lutobo nodded . " Do you know which one ? " Shannon persisted . The captain shook his head . " Apparently his mate took him back to their cabin . But if we 're going to have aliens berserking aboard my ship , I want to know why . I 'd especially like to know what set him off . If it was the cats ... " Shannon sat forward in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find out , Captain . As I recall , there are only six Aludrans , and they all have adjoining quarters . Anything else ? " The captain rose as a low , deep-throated chime sounded throughout the ship , signaling its imminent departure from parking orbit . The previous lines of pain in his face were already easing from the drug . " Yes , you might check on those cats , when you finish with the Aludrans . Talk to this Commodore Seton , who brought the cats aboard . There 's also supposed to be a doctor in his party . Maybe you can learn something from him . And do n't let anyone distract you . Our first jump comes up in less than an hour . " Ten minutes later , Shannon was moving briskly down the corridor toward the Aludrans ' quarters , a medical kit slung on her shoulder and a wealth of new information in her mind about these particular Aludrans . She was already familiar with the racial type , of course . Fledgling physicians were required during their training to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to complete certain survey courses in alien psychology and culture . The latter training had been augmented in even greater detail when Shannon came to work for the Gruening Line , since a starliner 's medical officer might routinely ex- ? 1 to encounter a far larger variety of alien patients n most planetside doctors saw in a lifetime . In two N , Shannon certainly had seen her share . I.c 1 t obo 's remark about demons disturbed her , otigli , for she remembered that the Aludrans were a ry mystical people , possessed of an ancient and intrite myth system , and actually believed in supernatu1 beings . They were also slightly telepathic among *hrnrselves , though not with other races  --  which ru r r t that one terrified Aludran could infect all the hers . her quick review of their medical records conturd I that these particular Aludrans were religious gl t i ns bound for a retreat on Tel Taurig , which was have been the ship 's next destination before they rrtrcl to B-Gem . The leader , a lai  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several major universi1 u r t h on and off his home planet and carried the iit.ction of a respected and stable individual one could never be really certain when evaluatalirns by human standards . She remembered rt t m ig him briefly at the captain 's reception , their I night out , and being impressed . ticicraring her shoulders , Shannon paused in front Ilre ? lirst Aludran cabin and thumbed the call buzzer mil times . Neither that signal nor several more - clicc  --  ed any response . Nor did she have any better ck . i t t he second cabin . 1 It l t as she approached the third , which was aslied to Muon and his mate , she could hear sounds of wcment and an occasional sob or moan , even ( ) ugh the cabins were supposed to be relatively tintiproofed . Pushing the buzzer this time produced ddrn and complete silence but no acknowledgement nrr tice intercom . When no one responded after sev buzzes , she took out an override key and rte  --  d it in a slot beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A circuit relayed , the buzzer sounded again , and a  | green light came on in the buzzer button . " This is Doctor Shannon , the ship 's surgeon , " she said in a low voice , speaking into the grille below the buzzer . " I 've used a medical override because the captain asked me to be certain you were all right . I 'm sorry to disturb you , but I understand that one of your party had an unpleasant experience a little while ago . " There was a short silence and then the scurry of feet and the sigh of a breath being drawn near the intercom . " Please to go away , Doctor , " piped a thin , reedy voice , thickly accented . " You can nothing do . " Shannon peered at the grille and at the blank vid screen beside it , wishing her medical immunity permitted her to override visual as well as audio circuits . In an emergency , she could override the door itself , but she would have to justify her actions later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no evidence of any real emergency . " I do n't mean to contradict you , " she replied , " but if you wo n't tell me what 's wrong , how do I know that there 's nothing I can do ? I realize that you 're upset , but I have my orders . May I at least speak with Muon , your leader ? " " No ! " came the emphatic reply . " Lai Muon not wish speak to anyone . I speak for him . I am his laia . This not concern you , Doctor . " " As a physician , it always concerns me if one of my passengers is in distress , " Shannon said gently . " May I please come in , just for a moment ? I promise you , I 'll do nothing without your permission , and I 'll leave if you want me to , as soon as I 've been inside and confirmed that everyone is all right . " She heard a faint twittering in the background , quickly muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then : " You go away then ? " the voice asked plaintively . " After I 've been inside , of course I will . "  | She pulled out her override key as a faint click waled the door circuit being activated . A puff of hot , INt air stirred her dark hair as the door slid back , site felt her weight decrease slightly as she crossed t h reshold . The Aludran atmosphere was oxygen , t angy with some alien scent she could not idenbut she knew that nothing about the normal dran environment was harmful to humans . The rly-degree temperature differential had her sweatImmediately , though , and she hoped she would d no reason to stay in the Aludrans ' cabin overlong . " You come this way , Doctor , " said the Aludran who : acicnitted her . " Muon over here . " The cabin was dim , but not so dim that Shannon Id not see that the four other Aludrans were stand- 35 and kneeling around the chair of a distressedlug elder . Though Aludrans normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mage , this one looked almost monochromatic . Even scarlet and yellow feathers of his crest seemed elrcl against the grayish down that covered his neck lid 1 he backs of his hands , and the skin stretched over r planes of his sharp , angular face was ashen . His M were closed , his head leaning against the chair k , and the fur-lined robes he needed to wear outelr the warmth of his cabin had been thrown back to ral a simple garment of amber crysilk that flowed na a scarlet scholar 's collar and stole and partially rred his claw-toed feet . The female who had opened door , rose-gowned to match her plumage , moved sickly to his side and knelt beside him , her delicate tact resting anxiously on the elder 's , to face Shannon . " ' flats Lai Muon , Doctor . You see now , he unharmed *lid resting . You go now ? " Shannon , who had reviewed the basics of Aludran ( ) tccc  --  c , l when she scanned their medical records , gave rrlaal salute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elder , touching two fingers to her lips , to  | her breast , and then extending her open palm outward in the degree appropriate for near-equals . Several of the other Aludrans twittered among themselves in surprised approval at that , and the female kneeling beside Muon inclined her head cautiously in acknowledgement . " You know our ways . " " Some of them , " Shannon conceded . " Must I go immediately ? I am concerned that Lai Muon was distressed . " The female returned a curt nod , but it was not one of dismissal . " Please excuse , Doctor , but our people very frightened by what happen to Lai Muon , and most not speak 36 your language well . I speak for Muon . He rests now , as you see . " Shannon nodded , casually letting her left hand drift closer to the scanner controls on her medical kit . " Can you tell me what happened ? " she asked . " My captain was told that Muon said something about ? demons . " Unreadable emotion flickered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak , Muon himself opened sharp yellow eyes and shook his head slightly . " Co-mekatta , Ta'ai , " he chided the Aludran woman softly . " Doctor , I apologize if I have caused your captain alarm . Someone misheard me , I fear . Please , do not concern yourself . We can deal with what must be done . " Shannon looked him over carefully , her physician 's eye evaluating the alien even as she moved slightly closer to him . " Are you certain you 're all right , sir ? " " I am certain , Doctor . " " You wo n't mind if I scan you , then , to see for myself ? " " If you must . " She scanned him , but a quick glance at the status tallies confirmed that what Muon said was true , at  | in far as his physical health was concerned . With Igh . Shannon let the scanner back down on its Ir , glancing at the others in the room . " Well , sir , you do appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would tell me ? " ' Please , Doctor , " Muon whispered . " I know . I promised to leave , and I shall , " Shannon Irtt resignedly . " But if there should be any further - Irrrr , I hope that you 'll contact me . I want to help , if n " ' I hank you , Doctor , " Muon murmured in dismis " I should like to rest now , if you do not mind . " An you wish , sir . " h r. r r r i ion withdrew with a slight bow , reentering ( ' - tiler corridor with relief . She had not been aware 37 11 I n the cabin , but her uniform was stuck to her it , and perspiration crawled along her scalp and ( led across her upper lip . She resisted the urge to it over her shoulder as the cabin door slid shut h I r r t 1 her , and she concluded that whatever had riled Ali ic t raps was likely to remain a mystery for the tir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had time to ) I off and change to a fresh uniform before going low to look at these strange creatures that aprrrrtly had precipitated the aliens ' distress . At id in the cargo hold assigned to the creatures in ( Muoer  --  a square , high-ceilinged compartment peralrn twenty meters on a side  --  Mather 's Rangers had I , r , rt ly secured most of the equipment brought aboard fitnr the shuttle . What was not battened down along Ow perimeter or stowed in storage lockers had gone Into the small security room opening off the larger pres. where two of the men were splicing it into the ettIst ing security system  --  much to the mystification of Ilene men from ship 's security . Just in front of the IliIltt 's exit door , Mather and two more Rangers were $1 ' rrnhling something that looked very much like an  | airlock made of plasteel mesh . The other three , under Wallis 's supervision , worked at jockeying the four cages into position for reconnection , one of them hooking up the big scanners atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all to the raucous accompaniment of four disgruntled Lehr cats . Actually , Wallis decided as she circled the long line of cages and took random readings with her hand scanner , the cats had weathered their transfer from BGem reasonably well , displaying real hysteria only when the anti-gray lifters were first attached to their cages and they began to float . But terror had fast faded to apparent curiosity when weightlessness did not seem to harm . And when lessened weight did return once the cages were ensconced aboard the shuttle ship , Empire Standard gravity being lighter by a sixth than B-Gem Normal , the cats found themselves accordingly lighter , more agile , and almost a little intoxicated by the time docking was made with the Valkyrie . The only other anxious moment had come when the cats had been moved from the shuttle to the Valkyrie and vented their displeasure on the ears of everyone in the vicinity of the shuttle bay . Not that the big cats had really settled down yet . Nor would they , until the cages were reconnected and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason , one or another of them would let out a great roar ? much to the chagrin of the three ship 's security guards , who had even closed the door to the security office in an effort to shut out the noise . But at least there was none of that frenzied clashing against the wire mesh , which the big cats had sometimes tried on B-Gem to amuse themselves . The two males looked quite befuddled by it all , and the female called Emmaline had even settled down sufficiently to nap , her oval topaz eyes shuttered to mere slivers beneath twitching , tufted ears . The other female had  | iiys been the least amiable of the four , and contint to pace back and forth in her cage , growling and Wil c i c rg her tail against the mesh . She was also the one Who seemed to be making the most noise . " Well , old Matilda is certainly vocal enough , " Mather said I to Wallis as he came to look over her shoulder at het uiedscan readings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wallis grinned and glanced sidelong at him . " You haveir't been telling her , have you ? Some people do n't nerd lump medication to get them through , and most prop ) do n't react worse from the pills than they do thmr the jump . You 'd better hope our little pets take rr t heir ' mom ' rather than their dad ' . " " HI settle for them making it through alive , " Mather 39 Id . " Casey , are we nearly ready to activate that lock ? " A sandy-haired Ranger back at the entry portal gave thciinbs-up in response . " ' IWo minutes , Commodore . " " Good . Webb , how 're we coming on the reconnections ? I think that a lot of this caterwauling is going to S lop , once they 're back together again  --  I hope . " " Ready as soon as we 've jumped , sir . " " Excellent . " As Webb and another Ranger continued to tinker With the cages and Mather drifted over to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to scan the cats . She turned , though , at the hull ( ) t one of the Rangers by the door , as a dark-haired young woman in officer 's livery entered the hold and S topped inside the security lock , looking puzzled . Her Inyl ; nla and the medical scanner slung across her shoulder- identified her as one of the ship 's medical Mall . " Is there something we can do for you , Doctor ? " Mat her asked , signaling Casey to let her through . " Ali , you must be Commodore Seton , " Shannon maid . " Actually , I was looking for the doctor who 's supposed to 1w with your party . I 'm Shivaun Shannon ,  | ship 's surgeon . " " Ah , then , you 're looking for me , " Wallis replied , approaching the younger woman with a smile and an outstretched hand . " I 'm Doctor Wallis Hamilton . Mather and I are in charge of this operation . " Good manners prompted Shannon to shake hands with both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two of them , her eyes drawn irresistibly to the four caged cats . " So , that 's what 's been wreaking havoc on our passengers ' nerves and giving our captain headaches , " she murmured , awed , though she immediately recovered and gave them both a conspiratorial grin . " Both are very dangerous occupations aboard this ship , you know . " Wallis shrugged and returned the grin . " What can I say , Doctor , except that I 'm sorry . Who would have guessed you 'd have Aludrans on the observation deck this morning ? And as for the captain  --  well , unfortunately , I suppose our friends ' shrieking can give one a headache , if one is so inclined . " " Well , our captain is , and he certainly did have one , " Shannon replied . " It is n't really your fault . However , just so I can reassure him and anyone else who asks , I do n't suppose there 's any way they could get out ? " Mather raised an eyebrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely , Doctor . No , I 'm afraid the only danger from our furry friends is the possibility of jangled nerves  --  and even that should be minimal , once we get them settled down . " As if in support of the fact that they had not settled down yet , the smaller male let out an ear-piercing yowl that immediately was echoed in triplicate by his mate and the other pair . Shannon grimaced and covered her ears , then chuckled uneasily as the screams subsided . " Well , I 'll hope that 's soon . Our first phase jump is coming up shortly . I suppose the medication will calm them down a little  --  or can you sedate them ? "  | Wallis shook her head resignedly . " Afraid not , Doclot Unfortunately , they 're allergic to the standard Jump medication  --  deadly allergic , in fact . For that Matter , we have n't found much that they can tolerate . ' fir expedition before ours , which brought back the ptly other pair in captivity , lost five from bad drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost Iwo ourselves  --  even with the benefit of prior knowledge not to mention two Rangers and several local rlile ... " Are n't you taking a big risk , then ? " Shannon kr ( I. " And why bother , especially with the vast extime involved ? " Willis sighed . " I know it seems ridiculous . UnfortuIrly , the emperor 's pair has n't bred in captivity , and 41 needs these rather badly . I wish I could tell you why , 1 I ca n't . Actually , these are in far better shape than ( ci the others that have been captured alive . We they 'll be able to survive the jumps without too loch clanger  --  though it certainly is n't going to be ) fort able for them . " " ( ) r for us , " Mather murmured under his breath . Shannon studied the cats thoroughly for several ( erects , then turned back to the two scientists . " I take that you 'll be riding out the phase jump here , then , l h the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . She was interrupted by the discreet chiming of a use warning signal ; the lights dimmed and came it to fall . Shannon glanced at a red light that had tin flashing insistently above the door and conled a smile as she moved in that direction . " Well , that 's the five-minute warning . I was going to vile you to join me in Medical Section . We 're testing Irc r iew suspension units that seem to be even better n ( ! rugs for getting people through jumps without or However ? " Wallis echoed the resigned shrug of her fellow phy- sician . " Sorry . As much as we 'd like to take you up on it , I 'm afraid our friends may need us . Maybe Mather can try your new toy the next time , though . He hates jumping , and the standard medication makes him queasy . " " And jumping makes me queasy . " Mather sighed . " A fine fate for a former starship commander , is n't it , Doctor Shannon ? Neither the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The unfair part is that Wallis jumps clean and is n't affected at all . " " You mean you jump without medication ? " Shannon paused by the security lock . " I never heard of that . " " I had n't either , " Wallis said . " My mind just seems to click off during that instant of phase shift . I 've tried to teach Mather how to do it , but ? " She sighed and shrugged , giving Shannon an exaggerated expression of patient long-suffering , and Shannon shook her head in amused disbelief . " Well , it 's your headache . Incidentally , if Commodore Seton is still interested in food after an unmedicated jump , you 're both invited to dine at the captain 's table this evening . The purser asked me to tell you it will be formal . " If Mather had any misgivings about the probable condition of his stomach by dinnertime , his enthusiastic acceptance of the invitation did not show it . When Shannon had gone , Mather 's mood was almost jovial as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's security guards to their jump stations in the adjoining security room . Wallis glanced at him sidelong as she positioned an oxygenator beside the cat cages . " My , are n't we gallant today ? " she remarked with a sly grin . " She is pretty , Mather , and probably very bright . " Mather found a spot between two steel stanchions and braced himself as the one-minute warning vibrated through the nearly empty hold .  | is n't nice for a doctor to gloat over someone 's ire discomfort , " he said in a tone of mock-injury . " If fie so great , why do n't you find me a cure ? And , yes , r c11 ( I seem bright . " Wit 1 t a chuckle for an answer , Wallis flicked on the stir scanners above each cat cage and set them to ? ot c1 , steadying herself with only one hand against a ilk head as a pulse counted down the last ten seconds phase-shift . Mather braced himself more substanly , feet apart and hands wrapped hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its being r fault if he died . Then , for an endless instant , there was a total at ion of sound , light , warmth , gravity  --  and a ping vibration that centered at the base of Mather 's 43 till , only to explode agonizingly behind his eyes , as if t lie cells of his body suddenly had been swapped end r vial and jolted with a powerful electric charge . I le felt the familiar shudder of nausea and disorient iot t as weight and other sensations returned ; he Sliced at the pain in the back of his head as he opened in eves on the stabilizing light . Wallis , after a perfuncy glance to be sure that his reaction was no worse un usual , turned her attention to the cats , who were ppt.twlyd on the bottoms of their cages and beginning In mewl piteously . Mather , despite his own distress , Was only a step behind her ; it was he who began /lacing oxygen into the cage of the smaller male , who was having trouble breathing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few minutes , the animal 's breathing rased and he , too , began yowling with his fellows . Mittlter , with a sigh of relief , turned the oxygenator in Illy own direction and took several deep breaths . " Poor old Sebastian . You know , I would n't be sur1-t Iye  --  d if jumping is even nastier for these poor beasties Ilt , ut it is for me , " he said . " How are yours doing ? " Wallis glanced at the medical tallies above the cages  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | before leaving B-Gem . Fortunately , they adapted to the small animals that were brought in by the first colonists as well , so there 'll be no problem keeping them supplied . Still , I doubt I 'd put my hands in one 's cage to find out whether he liked human fare . " Across the table , a hitherto silent young woman in turquiose shivered as she poked at her food with a fork . " Well , I have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures , they certainly are frightening to look at . Are they as ferocious as lions ? I saw a lion once , " she added , almost as an afterthought . Captain Lutobo , increasingly aloof at the head of the table , made no comment , choosing instead to pretend great interest in the vegetable dish that the stewand had just presented for his inspection . An awkward silence settled over the table until Wallis turned to the other woman and smiled kindly . " Well , there is a superficial resemblance to Earther lions , of course . In fact , they were first classified as Felis leo caeruleus  --  blue lion cats . That was the doing of Doctor Samuel Lehr . He described them as great , golden-eyed felines with dense blue fur , neck ruffs on the males , and tufted ears and tails . They 're chiefly nocturnal , sometimes arboreal , definitely carnivorous  --  and they can be as vicious as a Furudite rockspitter when cornered . Lehr was never able to capture one alive . " " But was n't Lehr 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor ? " asked a lean , intense-looking older man who had missed being introduced by arriving late at table . " If I remember my history correctly , the first expedition found a sparse native population of humanoids who revered the cats as messengers of a moon goddess  --  the changeable eyes and such , you understand . Unfortunately , the native population vanished during the years of isolation after the Cruaxi Sweep . Diseases brought by Earthers , I believe . "  | Mather turned speculative hazel eyes on the man . ? Yoii seem to know a great deal about B-Gem 's history , MisIer ? " " It 's Doctor Torrell . " The man 's sneering arrogance  --  just in the way he picked up a glass and languidly twirled the stem between thumb and forefin ( are almost brought Mather out of his chair . " It 's I k u ? t o r Vander Torrell . And I prefer the older name for IlhV planet in question : Il Nuadi , the Light of the Shinbig Ones . It has a splendid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mather murmured , raising his own glass to drink , rather than letting himself get angry enough In show his contempt for the man . At last he had a face to connect to the name . Vander hu tell was one of the most professionally renowned 49 and personally disliked historian-archaeologists current ly working with alien cultures . The Imperial computers had recommended Torrell above almost all others when putting together the B-Gem expedition , and Wallis had sent several increasingly pleading spacegr.uns to secure his services . 1 Torrell had not been interested , even for the exorbitant fee offered by the Imperial government , and eventually had turned down an invitation , only just %hurt of a command , from Prince Cedric himself . " Ot her pressing obligations , " the final refusal had read . Other pressing obligations , indeed , Mather ihonght , as he let a steward refill his glass . Though he had no way to check just now , he had an overwhelming Nispicion that Torrell 's " pressing obligation " was nothbig more urgent than a desire to go on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one liked that sort of thing , Mather had to admit , and undoubtedly made the sweeter for Torrell by the statuesque blonde blowing kisses adoringly across the table at her benefactor  --  but there was such a thing as duty . Mather found himself taking perverse satisfaction in knowing that the Valkyrie would break no records this  | trip , thereby depriving Torrell of at least part of his pleasure . He felt his wife 's foot move slightly against his own even as he became aware of the almost empathic link they sometimes shared , and he sensed her concurrence in his opinion of the man . He was very tempted to follow through on the avenue that Torrell himself had opened and to expose the man for the hypocrite he really was , but before he or Wallis could act , Shannon put down her glass and leaned forward , handsome and animated in her stark dress whites . " I 've read several of your books , Doctor Torrell , " she said , deftly turning the conversation to his benefit . " I especially enjoyed your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning any additional research in that area ? " Torrell inclined his head in as gracious a manner as he was likely to manage , but it soon became obvious that he did not want to talk about Wezen I. " Thank you , Doctor Shannon , you 're very kind , but Il Nuadi holds my true interest at this time . If only I had known that the Valkyrie would stop there , I might have rearranged my schedule to manage another visit . " If you had come with us , Mather thought bitterly , you could be just concluding another visit  --  and with the thanks of the emperor , too . As it is , you probably cost us several lives . But he said : " Yes , I 've heard of your work with the lost race of Il Nuadi , Doctor Torrell . In fact , you 're probably the acknowledged authority in that field , are n't you ? " " In all modesty , I suspect that I am , Commodore , " Torrell replied smoothly . " Did you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your Lehr cats and the catlike creatures of at least three other vanished civilizations ? Except , of course , that the other cat-creatures were looked upon as ravening demons and soul-eaters , not lunar messengers . A curious dis- t i action , do n't you agree ? And I believe that the Aluc I rans , who are by no means extinct , also share that view . " The young woman who had spoken before gasped , tier reddened lips agape . " Demons ? " She glanced over I icr shoulder uneasily and shuddered . " You do n't think t 1 iat the Lehr cats might be ? " " Demons , too ? " Torrell smiled unctuously . " I very mulch doubt it , dear lady . On the other hand , Commodore Seton never did tell us what happened to Samuel Lehr . You do know , do n't you , Seton ? Or you , Doctor I l:c milton ? " Wallis suppressed a sigh , furious at the direction the conversation was taking and all but convinced that ' lrrell had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . She found herself disliking the man even more than she had before . And if he kept up this talk about demons and soul-eaters , he could start a wave of anxiety among the passengers . There was already too hatch talk about the cats . Of course Mather and I know , Doctor Torrell , " Wallis said . " But not everyone here at the table is a trained hrtrntist who can remain dispassionate through the most grisly tale . I simply did n't think it was something t hat the young lady would care to discuss over dinner . " " Why ? Because Lehr was eaten by one of his cats ? " Wallis lowered her eyes uneasily , acutely sensitive to Bic effect Torrell 's words were having on an increasing tic i tuber of those at table . Beside her , visible only from her unique vantage point , Mather had begun methodically crushing the napkin that lay otherwise unseen across his lap . " Oh , come now , Doctor , " Torrell continued . " Animals kill to survive . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sure that the good Doctor Lehr had taken his toll of the cats . What fate could have been more fitting ? " A wave of nervous comment rippled around the  | table much to the dismay of Wallis and Mather . But before they were forced to respond to this latest sortie , rescue of a sort came in the guise of a steward who bent to whisper briefly in Shannon 's ear . The younger physician listened intently for several seconds , conversation dying around her , then put aside her napkin and smiled reassuringly . " You must excuse me , ladies and gentlemen , but a doctor is always on call , I 'm afraid . Captain , I do n't think it 's anything serious , but I like to be sure . " " Of course , Doctor . I 'll stop in later for a report . " " Thank you , Captain . " As Shannon rose , she glanced at Wallis . " Doctor Hamilton , perhaps you 'd care to join me ? You might find our medical facility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new suspensor units when we 're finished , if you 'd like . " It must have been obvious to all that Shannon 's invitation went beyond mere professional courtesy , but even Torrell was not rude enough to point that out publicly . When Mather had added his own apologies to Wallis 's , the two of them followed Shannon out of the grand dining salon . Not until they had stepped aboard a staff lift and the doors had closed did Shannon look directly at them . " Thank you for playing along , " she said . " I hope you do n't feel that you 've been dragooned into anything , but Muon apparently is having another anxiety attack . He 's the Aludran who panicked when you brought your cats aboard this morning , " she added , at their looks of question . " I thought you might be able to help me reassure him that the cats are n't going to eat him  --  or whatever it is he 's afraid they 're going to do . You speak Aludran , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Among my other dubious talents , " Mather said with a nod . " I 'll be glad to help , if I can . " " Thank you . In any case , the steward said Muon  | was delirious , " Shannon went on . " He keeps ranting &Halt; devil cats and demons in the dark  --  exactly what 1 ' ' tu t ell was talking about over dinner . My assistant is wait him now , but he 's only a student intern . I do n't Iltlnk he 's experienced enough to handle something like this . " SIiannon fell silent as the lift came to a stop and the dew s opened . She cautioned curcumspection as she Mather and Wallis down a corridor , for other pasgers were about . The door to the main Aludran bits slid open almost before she could thumb the call Iton , however , the youngest of the four male Muutts admitting them with a bow . " Good you come , Doctor , " the alien said haltingly. on , he plenty bad . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air closed around the three of them r a moist hand as they crossed the threshold : it was daily oppressive to Mather and Shannon in their tt- ( ? ollared uniforms . Across the room , Deller and a ruled looking medical technician were gesticulating Itidy at a hysterically weeping female who Shannon ' ow i i zed as Ta'ai , Muon 's mate . Deller had a hypo in ) il ' hand and seemed to be trying to persuade Ta'ai to 1 herself be sedated , but the alien woman only nirc1 herself the more firmly between them and the rlhest berth . Someone  --  presumably Muon  --  was rushing frenetically in that berth , and the shadowed Ins of other Aludrans appeared to be having no luck -i I t i t to the occupant . Nor did Deller , the technician , anot her male Aludran seem to be having any luck in 1 1 I t t g through to the distraught Ta'ai . " I ) oc  --  tor Deller , why do n't you let me take over now ? " hannon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick , humid air with quiet authority , and the intern 's head whipped around In a glance of relief . " I ) octor Shannon , am I ever glad to see you ! " Leaving his reluctant patients , Deller crossed to  | meet Shannon and the others , his plain , serious face sheened with perspiration . " He 's having some kind of seizure , Shivaun . He was almost convulsing a little while ago , but she wo n't let me near him , and I did n't dare force the issue . Maybe you can reason with her . " " Laia Ta'ai , " Shannon said , brushing past Deller to confront the alien woman , " Doctor Deller was only trying to help . And pardon me for saying so , but you are not helping , so long as you continue to weep like a child and refuse to let us help Lai Muon . " " They will kill us ! They will eat us all ! " Ta'ai wept , shaking her head frantically . " Muon has seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Laia Ta'ai ? " Shannon asked , quietly reaching one hand behind her for the hypo that Deller had been trying to administer . " No one aboard this ship is going to eat you , I promose . You 're perfectly safe . " Despite Shannon 's caution , Ta'ai saw the hypo change hands and shook her head , backing away wideeyed . " No , I must not sleep ! He must not sleep ! The Screamers in the Night will ? " But before she could tell them what the Screamers in the Night would do , one of the other aliens came from behind and pinned Ta'ai 's arms to her sides , nodding for Shannon to move . Ta'ai screeched and hiccuped and tried to twist away , but not before Shannon pressed the hypo firmly to her throat , quickly confirming the setting before she triggered it . Even as the hiss of the hypospray died away , Ta'ai was slumping into her captor 's arms . The alien deposited her in an empty berth opposite Muon 's , then motioned Shannon closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother to Ta'ai , " he said haltingly as the med tech moved in to monitor Ta'ai 's condition . " You help Muon now ? " " I will , if you can tell me what 's wrong , " Shannon  | ** exchanging the hypo for a medscan pickup that Diller handed her and bending closer to run it along 11w length of Muon 's body . As Wallis and Mather edged a little closer , Bana swallowed visibly and bowed his head . " I think we all in very great danger , Doctor . Muon is seer . He has second sight . " He glanced up cautiously , as if expecting a rebuff , and added , " Is true . " " I do n't doubt it for a minute , " Mather murmured . " Please go on . " Bana glanced nervously at the gold bullion crowns on Mather 's shoulder boards and collar , then at Shannon . " Is  --  is all right to talk in front of crown man ? " he ventured . " Yes , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady is another doctor . Tell us , Bana . " " I  --  I tell . " Bana sighed . " Short while ago , Muon go Into  --  worship trance . I not know your word , but that Is close to idea . Muon fine at first . He one of best seers I know . But soon see devils in dark , with eyes like fire sparks  --  and fangs . And devils in dark named Death . Muon very afraid . " " What do the devils look like , Bana ? " Mather asked , afraid he already knew all too well . " You should know , Crown-man-Lai , " Bana returned . " You bring devils on board ship . Maybe you not know . But soon , too late for all of us . " " Why do n't you step over here and tell me what you mean by that ? " Mather said , taking the uneasy Bana firmly by the elbow and drawing him aside . " Muon will be fine with Doctor Shannon . " The other aliens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own language to cont t-iue questioning Bana , leaving Shannon and Wallis to examine the still delirious Muon in peace . The elder alien had stopped his violent thrashing and was now merely moaning and rolling his head from side to side ,  | eyes closed . " He 's going to burn himself out , if he keeps this up , " Shannon said , frowning as she clamped one hand to Muon 's thin wrist and carefully lifted an eyelid with the other . " Del , let 's give him three units of Suainol . Even for an Aludran , his heart rate and pressure are too high , and there 's something else going on that I do n't begin to understand . " " He still in worship trance , " Bana stated firmly , craning his neck to see what Shannon was doing before Mather recalled him to his questioning . As Deller passed another hypo to Shannon , Wallis 's hand shot out to close around her wrist . " Wait , " Wallis said . " I have an idea . Give him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him all of that , he 'll be out for a full sleep-cycle  --  maybe even longer . I 'd like to try to find out more about why he 's so frightened . " Shannon glanced pointedly at her hand , and Wallis slowly released it . Though Shannon withdrew the hypo casually , she made no move to change the setting . " I 'm responsible for this patient 's physical wellbeing , Doctor Hamilton . I 'm afraid that my responsibility has to come before your curiosity . " " It 's more than curiosity , " Wallis replied . " Look : Mather and I are somewhat familiar with this worship trance that Bana was talking about . I think we can use it to our advantage . There 's been an implication that our cats are responsible for Muon 's condition , and Muon himself has given a warning . I respect the Mudrans ' abilities far too much to discount that warning without further investigation . " " Are you saying that your cats are Devils in the Dark , Doctor ? " Shannon said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wallis shook her head . " Perhaps part of it is . But I think it 's worth a little investigation to find out what triggered this particular superstitious response in this particular Aludran . They do n't normally succumb to  | t-c , t tonal scenes , Shannon  --  especially a lai of Muon 's ItYalltwr . If you merely brush it off , you 'll be doing him slid us a great disadvantage . " Shannon sighed and glanced down at the still aping Muon , at her medical scanner , then relucntly slapped the hypo into Wallis 's open palm and stepped aside . You leave me little choice , do n't you , Doctor ? If I Were to refuse at this point , your husband probably Mrccilcl invoke the authority of the Imperial government isccl you 'd still have your way . " She folded her arms Mlhnedly as Wallis readjusted the instrument . " At st the half dose should bring his vital signs closer to rcc:cl , which is the critical factor right now . I guess it 1 ' 1 hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hissed against the inside of Muon 's thin IKl . " No , and it might help , " Wallis said . " Mather , I 'll cl you in just a minute . " Mather , who had continued to converse quietly th the other aliens while his wife and Shannon tied , came closer as Wallis took Shannon 's scanner , erked its readings , then administered a small addiital amount of medication . The other aliens crowded behind and around Mather as he pulled a chair er to Muon 's bedside and sat . " I le should be ready , " Wallis murmured . Mather nodded . " Okay , let 's give it a try . Lai Muon , name is Mather Seton . Bana said it would be all ht if I talked with you . Are you more comfortable Mt ion nodded slightly , his eyes peacefully closed , r hawklike features relaxed . Mather , with a quick lice at his wife , then at Shannon , let one hand lie hily across Muon 's wrist . With his other hand he haled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sini . Lai Muon , I am going to ask you a few questions . I wc i t yin u t O relax and listen to what I say . To make it  | easier for you , I will speak your language . Essa di ? " Again , the slight nod . " Farsh . Durada-dan i ? " " Muon Vai-di-Chorrol , Lai Murrata gogorros e-do . " " Farsh . Sura-kei ? " The dialogue went on for nearly a quarter hour , Mather speaking in a soothing monotone and Muon responding at first in monosyllables , then in more complicated patterns of which Wallis caught the general drift , even if Shannon did not . Finally , Mather sighed and raised his head , then stood and signed for Wallis to give the rest of Shannon 's previously prescribed medication . The other aliens gave him respectful nods as he glanced at them before turning back to Shannon . " You might ask Doctor Deller or one of your other people to stay with him through the night . He 's been through quite an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I pushed him pretty hard . " Shannon nodded . " I ca n't spare Deller for very long , but Jacy can stay , " she said , nodding to the med tech . " Did you find out anything useful , after all that ? " " We can talk about it on the way to the hold , " Mather said , making a slight bow to the Aludrans as he began moving toward the door . " I 'd like to check on the cats again , before turning in . " With a nod to her assistant , Shannon followed Mather and Wallis out into the corridor . The normal ship 's temperature was like the cold of deep space by comparison , and their fatigue came sinking down on them with the return of normal gravity . " Well ? " Shannon asked , as they headed again toward the crew lift . Mather managed a weary smile . " I 'm not sure how much of this is going to make sense to you , Doctor , but it explains a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallis . It fits in with what Torrell was saying at dinner , too , though I 'm not about to tell him that . Apparently the Aludrans  | have a mythic tradition  --  call it a racial memory , if you like in which large , catlike creatures figure as the local equivalent of devils . They 're actually more green Mtn blue , and they have tiny tentacles instead of n raper cat whiskers , but the similarity is close enough , wltett one is dealing with the subconscious . " " ' Then you think that this . . . racial memory was It IFj Bred when Muon saw the cats this morning , and 11-. tt 's what brought on the attack ? " Shannon asked . Mather nodded . " But that does n't explain tonight 's episode , at least not directly . Oh , seeing the cats earlier certainly did n't help , and it 's possible that this worship trot lee that Bana mentioned somehow allowed Muon to waking dream work of some kind  --  and in this case , I the terrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I ; ttt to let such superstition take control of him , " Shannon said thoughtfully . " Muon is an educated ntitn , Commodore . What does he think the cats are lug to do to him ? " " You said it yourself , Doctor , though I do n't think you t realized how true it was , " Wallis said . " He thinks they 're going to eat him . Ta'ai said it , too . So did Muon . I understood enough to catch that much . " " flut that 's ridiculous , " Shannon said flatly . " The i.e h r cats are n't demons . There 's no way they 're going to get loose and go on a rampage on this ship . " They stepped into the elevator , and Mather cocked Is head in Shannon 's direction as she pushed the u t t on for the cargo level . You know that , Doctor , and Wallis and I know that . 111 it we are n't necessarily talking about rational reMI H ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget that Muon is a seep among his own people . They believe he is , and we do n't dare discount that belief . As to how he thinks our cats are going to do it , I could n't even speculate , and I doubt if he could , either . "  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | medscan , " the man replied glumly . " They 're together , they 've got fresh food and water , the cages are clean . We 've about decided they just like to hear themselves scream . Peterson even tried singing to them . " Even Mather had to laugh at that , for Peterson 's voice was notably deficient in any quality that might soothe the savage beast . While Wallis ran repeated medscans on each cat , Mather reviewed the security tapes , looking for some anomaly that might account for the change in the cats ' behavior  --  such as some outside visitor who might have stirred them up . But after nearly half an hour , they were forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cats simply preferred screaming , just now . And whatever had 64 caused Muon 's most recent distress , the cats seemed to have had no part in it , at least directly . " Well , I 'm sure I have n't any idea what it all means , " Shannon said when it became apparent they were not going to find an easy answer . " Give me human patients , any day  --  speaking of which , I suppose I ought to get back and see whether any new crises have arisen in the last hour , before I turn in . I 'll also look in on Muon . Let me know if there 's anything I can do to help . " After a last inspection of the security arrangements in the hold , Mather and Wallis , too , returned to their cabin . Mather was almost fidgeting as he sat down in front of the library console and began tapping in a query , pausing only to open the stiff collar of his dress tunic . " Mather , we 've already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , coming to read over his shoulder as she began taking down her hair . " If it was n't in the Menkar Banks , I doubt we 're going to find it in a starliner 's library . " Mather only nodded and kept on typing . " Maybe not . But we have n't talked to this particular computer before . Maybe it will be able to suggest a new logic  | ttern for us . The whole thing might be so simple that ' re not seeing it .

Perplexed , Mather cleared the keyboard and glanced at Wallis , but she had stopped her hair brushing to focus elsewhere , apparently grappling with some nuance of possibility suggested by the reference . After a moment of contemplation , Mather hit the query button again and began tapping out another question . Reference , Lehr cats .

She had resumed brushing her hair , returned from wherever she had gone on her mind wandering . " Well , what do you think ? " he asked . " That the cats are screaming telepathically ? It is possible , I suppose . In fact , it would be a handy talent for a predator whose main source of food is other empathic animals . I 've never gotten any readings that would indicate telepathic sensitivity in the cats , but I was n't looking for it , either . There 's a lot we do n't understand about the mechanisms of psychic phenomena . " " That much is certain , " Mather agreed , thinking of his own off-again , on-again psychic abilities .

According to the serial number , he bought the bottle from ship 's stores only yesterday . If he drank it all last night , no wonder he thinks he 's been poisoned . " " Now , see here , young man !

" Abruptly the voice trailed off , followed by the unmistakable sound of a body slumping to the floor . " Orderly , " Deller called . Shaking her head slightly , Shannon leaned back far enough in her chair to peer into the next treatment room , where Deller and the steward were holding up an unconscious Jacob Carvan . A heavyset orderly was bringing in an antigravity floater from the outer corridor . " Everything all right , Doctor ?

" More like a conjecture , actually , " Wallis said , giving ' onion a folded piece of paper from her jumpsuit ? krt . " This is a list of equipment we 'd like to borrow , yot i ve got it .

" As her desk console shrilled an alert , a red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button in an automatic gesture , without looking up . " Shannon . " " Deck Three Security , Doctor . We have an emergency coming in for you : two passengers in shock or hysterics and a DB . " " A body ? " Shannon gasped as she looked up at the expression on the face of the security guard . Without taking her eyes from him , she slapped the signal button for Deller and the nursing staff to stand by for an emergency . " What happened ? " she demanded . " Who died ? " " A passenger  --  we think his name is Fabrial . And he did n't just die ; he was murdered . " " Murdered ? " " That 's right . The other two coming in found him . They 're too shaken up to give us a statement , so we 're going to let you handle that when you get them calmed down . We 'll send the body as soon as we 've finished the on-site investigation . " " You 're sure he 's dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's dead , all right . " A commotion in the outer office announced the arrival of the passengers in question , and Shannon dashed to assist . Mather and Wallis glanced at one another , at the face of the security officer just before he cut off , then moved into the doorway to watch and listen . Two stewards were bringing in a weeping woman of about thirty , Deller directing them into an adjoining treatment room and calling for a nurse . A dazed and shocky-looking middle-aged man had paused just inside the door to the outer office , a security officer supporting him under one elbow . There was a smear of drying blood on the back of the man 's hand  | ( 1 across the front of his expensive tunic and another rely visible on the guard 's maroon sleeve . " Lord Elderton and his wife , " Shannon murmured tiler- her breath . " Just what we needed . Del , that 's ly Elderton  --  I think her first name is Anne .

" All right , let 's get him inside , " Shannon said , leadg t here briskly through her office and into the adjoing treatment room , where Mather joined in helping ft their listless patient onto the padded table . When Ilk s pitched in , swinging standard diagnostic equiprot I n t o position from above , Shannon began loadg a hypospray . Elderton 's eyes continued to stare ankly . " I'lI take over from here , Matt , " Shannon said to the raid . She consulted the scanners while calibrating the hypo . " Thanks for bringing him in . Make sure someone not ilies me as soon as the body arrives . And if  | the captain has n't already been informed , make sure he is . " " Right , Doctor . " As soon as the man closed the door behind him , Mather and Wallis moved closer to the other side of the table to watch what Shannon was doing . Elderton had closed his eyes . " I think we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim 's blood , " Shannon said , gesturing at the smear on the tunic before injecting the man over the right jugular . " I 'll turn the lab loose on it after I 've stabilized him and gotten a statement . You realize , of course , that you should n't really be here for this . " Mather raised an eyebrow . " Would you rather we left ? " Shannon managed a strained smile . " I guess not . Frankly , I 'd be grateful for your assistance . Forensic medicine is not an area that 's stressed in the training one gets for starliner practice . I know the basics , of course , but  --  well , in your line of work , I 'm sure you 've witnessed this sort of thing many times .

" Can you hear me , Lord Elderton ? Just relax and let your medication take the edge off . I know you 've just been through a terrible experience , but you 're perfectly  | fr 11ow , and you 're going to be just fine . We do need a Irrnent from you , though .

Try to rememi Did he say anything else ? " No . He just  --  died  --  there , in my arms  --  and there us nothing I could do . And there was blood everyhere , and  --  please , no more ! I do n't want to remember iy more . No more , please ! " " All right . There 's no more . You 've done just fine . " it . hypo hissed as she triggered it against his neck ii n . " Go to sleep now . Relax and go to sleep . " Meticulously , then , and without turning off the ' order or looking at Wallis and Mather , who were changing puzzled glances , Shannon pulled another $nnt rcrment down to point at Elderton , focusing an aiming light squarely between his eyes . After adjusting ? tlnrer , she keyed the machine with her thumbprint . The light pulsed blue for several seconds , emitting a low pitched , throbbing hum , then cycled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she pushed thr instrument back into place and removed the cartridge from the recorder . " Go ahead and lecture me , Doctor Hamilton , " she said , laying the cartridge on a counter behind her and leaning against the edge to look at them at last . " You , at trust , must know what I just did . " Wallis nodded . " I have to say I 'm surprised , hower . I would n't have expected you to mind-wipe a Witness in a murder case . " " And totally without his consent  --  I know , " Shannon replied . " Still , it was necessary . Of course , mind- wipe is really a misnomer , as I 'm sure you know . When he wakes up in a few hours , secure in his berth , he 'll be able to remember , if he really tries . It will all seem like a dream , though , without the gory details and without the emotional involvement of the actual occurrence . The memory is n't really lost , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's submerged and veiled in less threatening symbolism . We 'll do the same for his wife . It 's company policy , not mine . " " Company policy , to tamper with a free citizen 's memory ? " Mather said in a low voice . Shannon sighed . " Commodore , the Gruening Line does n't like adverse publicity . Incidents such as this could be damaging to the company 's reputation . Now , I may not agree with company policy , but I work for Gruening , and I owe them for my professional training . That 's why I 'm here , after graduating at the head of my medical class , instead of serving a plushy residency on one of the major research satellites . Besides , the procedure is n't illegal . It 's often done if the attending physician feels that a traumatic memory might be damaging to the patient 's health . " " Or to the physician 's health , " Mather said . " Or to her job , " Shannon agreed . " That 's another reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Elderton 's statement , and it gets all of us off the hook , if the situation should be questioned later on . Without waiting for further comment , Shannon pushed a call button and then left as an orderly and a med tech entered with a floater . She took the record of Elderton 's statement with her . After the technician had taken several samples from the bloodstains on Elderton 's hand and clothing and a sample from Elderton himself , he and the orderly shifted the unconscious man onto the floater and took him out . Wallis and Mather followed in time to see Shannon coming out of Deller 's treatment room , now with two  | rt ridges in her hand , solemn and thoughtful as she utc  --  lied Deller guide another floater out to follow the . t , deeper into the back reaches of the medical facilty . Before they could decide whether to approach her alrl , however , the outer door to the reception area rrw aside to admit another floater  --  this one covrcl ? escorted by a tense-looking med @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word as Shannon directed the floater st her office and into one of the surgeries , she , rself , lowering it to the table  --  though the security an gave Mather and Wallis an odd look when they c ( lowed into the room and remained as Shannon witched on lights above the table . And as Shannon ? t+llrci back the covering from the body , both the techIrian and the security man watched Wallis and sit tier for their reaction . Wallis gasped . Mather stifled an oath . Shannon 's + ? c went white as her gaze swept the body . 13ut it was not the body itself , or even the victim 's tanner of dying , that had caused their varying reacIons . The apparent cause of death was massive lt+rc+rrna to the throat  --  the obvious source of the blood rrctclrning the entire front of the body , as Elderton had ru  --  ribed  --  but the wound was no worse than many at all three of them had seen before . It was the le t t in : s right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slashed and bloodied , several of the crr  --  at ions exposing tendon and bone .

" Even as he spoke , the speaker chimed and the Gruening logo dissolved to the gaunt face of a Ranger named Webb . " Webb here . " Drawing a deep breath , Mather glanced at Wallis , at Shannon and the body between them , at the med tech waiting uneasily behind them , and at the security guard , who looked as if he might just draw the needler on his hip . " Mister Webb , is everything all right there in the hold ? " " Well , sir , I was just about to call you . " Webb 's drawl sounded strained . " There are two men here from ship 's security , demanding to see the cats . They seem to think the critters got out and killed someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mather demanded . " And have you let them see the cats ? " " No to both questions , sir . I was n't about to let them in with weapons , and they would n't disarm before coming in . The cats are fine , though . They 're still making a lot of noise , of course , but  --  what 's going on , sir ? " " I 'll explain when I get there , " Mather replied , glancing at the others again . " In the meantime , I want you and Wing or somebody to go over the security tapes , working backward from right now . Look for anything , anything out of the ordinary . Have you got that ? " " Well , yes , sir , but  --  what about the security men ? " " They 'll just have to wait until I get there . I 'm on my way . " As he slapped off the intercom and headed for the door again , Shannon started after him . " But  --  wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't responsible ? That 's ridiculous . Any idiot ? " " Any idiot can jump to conclusions based on cir- tccrostantial evidence , Doctor , " Mather said , stopping hri with a glance . " Why do n't you get started on the autopsy , while I go and do what I do best ? Wallis , give her a hand . And you ? " He turned on the anxious Ow ( ' a ri ty guard with a finger pointed like a pistol . " If you hit end to come with me , do n't even think about pulling a weapon or trying to arrest me . I have the authority to place this ship under martial law , if I have to , and I 'll place you under arrest if you interfere . " " I le 'd do it , too , " Wallis told the man , who hesitated follow the retreating Mather . " But go ahead after $m. " she went on . " He knows you have a job to do . pit do n't try to keep him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire exchange , dislevied the med tech with a gesture and tried to collect 83 r wits . " What does he mean , circumstantial evidence ? " e blurted when the door had closed behind the ' lnician . " And who 's the idiot ? " She gestured anIly at the mutilated body . " Look at the man , Doctor ' Alton ! " Wallis let out a slow sigh . " I know . And I did . I admit at it looks fairly clear-cut . But you and I are scient Is . Let 's look at the facts . If the cats really are responHr . I want to know as much as you do . " " ' I'Iw facts speak for themselves , Doctor . " " lint , these are n't the only facts , " Wallis argued . ) ok , will you humor me for a few minutes ? Let 's Ink about this . " Wit h a look of extreme cynicism , Shannon set the ( Beal sensors to scanning for data and pulled a Irrluosahle lab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ putting hers on . " c ; c- ahead . I 'm listening . " " All right . Let 's suppose just suppose  --  that we 've tlrvrr ! card of Lehr cats . " " I wish I had n't , " Shannon muttered under her ht rat h as she pulled on surgical gloves .  | " I know . Just suppose . We 're provincial doctors . We 've never been off-planet , we 've never heard of Lehr cats , we 've never seen them  --  we have no idea that such creatures might exist . " " Oh , they exist , all right , " Shannon said , rolling a cart with surgical instruments closer . " Just ask Gustav Fabrial . " Wallis ignored the younger physician 's comment as she , too , gloved and resumed her inspection of the body . " Now , " she continued , " this man , this Fabrial , is brought in dead , and you , as chief medical officer , are asked to perform the autopsy and form a hypothesis as to cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Lehr cat . Fabrial could have been the victim of anyone or anything . " She gestured toward Shannon with a probe . " Now , who killed Fabrial ? " Shannon , cutting away the dead man 's jacket with a pair of surgical scissors , only shook her head . " This is pointless . " " No , do n't quit on me already . Who killed Fabrial ? What was the physical cause of death ? " Shannon gave a stubborn smile . " All right , just offhand , I 'd say he died of shock , contingent upon massive loss of blood induced by trauma .... " " Good . Go on . " " He has multiple lacerations of the chest and forearms " ? she looked shrewdly at Wallis ? " perhaps from claws ? " " We do n't know that yet . " " Very well , then , Doctor  --  not necessarily claws . then . Let 's say multiple parallel lacerations , approximately six to ten centimeters apart , in groups of four to five . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor ! From claws ! What else could make wounds like that ? " Wallis bowed her head and worried her lower lip briefly with her teeth .  | " All right , I 'll accept that for now , if you insist . Go And multiple throat lacerations , especially along r lateral aspects , " Shannon continued sourly . " From 11c . Doctor Hamilton ! Long teeth , sharp teeth ? rigs , if you will ! " Wallis leaned both hands against the edge of the Me and nodded slowly . " I know . And long blue hairs itched in his fist , presumably from the murderer . go . something with long blue hair , fangs , and claws 11rc1 Fabrial . And that something could only have rc a Lehr cat . I have to admit , it looks bad . " Shannon 's jaw dropped and she stared at her coigne dumbly for a few seconds . " You mean , " she rlly managed to reply , " you 're still not convinced ? st ill maintain that your cats did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want me to assert that I think the cats Ice through plasteel , a force lock , and the regular -r of the hold , evaded regular ship 's security on are decks , and then killed Fabrial and got back with1 anyone being the wiser ? " Wallis countered . " The screamers-in-the-night cart do thus , " said a filar voice . They turned to see Muon and Bana standing in the rrway , swathed in their fur-lined robes and shaking tth cold and dread . " I know that the demons were responsible , " Muon r - t I n tled , walking farther into the room and staring pi rssionlessly at the bloody body on the table . " Did I 1 tell you that the demons would devour us all ? And it has begun . " The cats were screaming even worse than the night lore when Mather reached Deck Six and headed ow. - rd their hold . Four confused ship 's security Kerc-rcls came to attention as he approached : two Mat her recognized from the night before , and two he Cl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going on ? " one of the familiar guards demanded as Mather pushed his way between them and thumbed the intercom button on the panel outside the door . " When Burton and Lewis , here , came and asked to see the cats a little while ago , your Rangers chucked us all out . Burton says someone was murdered by one of the cats . " " We do n't know that yet , " Mather said tersely , " and my men were just following their orders . " He glanced back at the door as the upper half transluced . Behind it , Perelli came to attention as he saw Mather . He had a heavy-duty stun carbine slung over his shoulder at the ready and was wearing a strange headset arrangement that completely covered his ears . " Ah , Commodore Seton , am I glad to see you . " Two more Rangers with headsets backed up the first as the outer door sphinctered open just far enough for Mather to duck into the security lock , but their stun carbines discouraged the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose darts could kill if too many struck a victim , a stun weapon would disable a living target with five to ten minutes of excruciating , paralyzing pain but leave no lasting effect or damage beyond sore muscles for a few days , making it an ideal defensive weapon for use aboard a spacecraft  --  and one with which the civilian-trained security guards had no desire to contend . " What 's happened , Perelli ? " Mather asked , as the Ranger took a fourth headset off a hook on the wall and handed it to him , and the other two took over at the door monitor . " Did ship 's security give you any trouble ? And what is this thing ? " " It helps filter out the cats ' screaming , sir , " Perelli replied . " Wing put the first one together last night , after you left , and engineering made up several more for us . They do n't help a lot , but they 're better than nothing . And you do n't really think those security guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he added with a  | t III . " They obviously do n't know what they 're talking c ) ( it , if they think the cats got past us . " " I hope not , " Mather murmured , glancing beyond rrrlli at the cat cages and their vocal occupants . here is Wing ? " " Reviewing the tapes , sir , just as you ordered . And 1 : rally advise using the headset , sir . " With a nod , Mather put the device over his ears and tf tied it on . He concluded , as he began moving closer t he cages , that any benefit to be derived from the lvlee was as much psychological as anything else . He Ipprd it off and let it hang loosely around his neck as continued around the cages , for he wanted no Iterference with natural perceptions . To all outward appearances , however , nothing had 87 hanged since the night before . The cages were still Ntied end to end , the four units forming a long , aMt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As Mather passed one end , the female they Illrc I Matilda stopped to glare at him ; she raised one NNet-sheathed forepaw as if to strike at him through r mesh , her tail lashing hard against the side of the Ige. 13ut he ignored her . I le was looking , first , for physical evidence : for WHid. for missing chunks of fur , for any sign of an Iletca t ion  --  but there was none . Visual inspection reled nothing at all untoward about the cats ' appearcr. 1 fowever , desultory readings with a pocket scan ! t ( lid seem to indicate some registration of pain . He Ipped on the big cage scanners and checked those , Kt . Now , that was unusual . Something was wrong . ranted , no one really knew very much about Lehr Itn. .  --  -d , Mather himself claimed no particular mediN expertise , but no seemingly healthy creature ought be radiating that kind of pain without some accomloving injury or illness . I It - t t here was more to the wrongness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he could see , but Mather was increasingly aware that something was not quite right about the area itself  --  the cages , or perhaps even the hold . Puzzled , he tried extending his senses slightly , to see whether he could detect anything psychically unusual . Something was out there to be read , but he could not seem to zero in on it . The sheer decibel level in the hold made it hard to concentrate . He slipped the headset back over his ears , but that only seemed to make matters worse , so far as his sketchily reliable psi abilities were concerned . Very well . He shut down mentally and sighed . He was simply going to have to do this the hard way . Casually he glanced over his shoulder at the Rangers . Perelli was busy logging something in his shift report , his two partners were watching the security guards still waiting outside , and the rest must be ensconced with Wing and Webb in the security room . He could see the dark green lump of someone lying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the room so they could sleep during off-duty hours without leaving the premises . If Mather was careful , he should have things over and done before anyone was the wiser . Slowly he made his way around the cages again , this time studying the room , rather than the cats , until he found a place he liked , where he could stand in the window of a stanchion without being closely observed , from either the door or the office . He pulled the headset around his neck again  --  he would simply have to put up with the auditory distraction until he could block it out  --  then leaned his shoulders and back against the bulkhead and let his head tip back , locking his knees to brace himself against the bulkhead . His hands fell loosely to his sides as he cleared his mind and took the three deep breaths that would  --  he hoped  --  trigger deep psi sensitivity . It would have been easier with the  | tight medication to ease the transition , but he had ( lone it cold before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 111 ( . best of circumstances . ) He never knew for certain whet her it would work , but this time it did . Slowly the sounds of the cats ' screaming , the tiny vibrations of the ship , and even the pressure and chill t-I the bulkhead at his back began to fade from awareness . He let his eyes drift shut as he turned all his attention inward . After several moments of mental gc'let ing , he gradually began to see though his mind 's eyes . I le did not like what he saw . He was aware of the is pacing in their cage , each of them radiating fear a i - ( 1 l he pain the scanners had detected earlier . In fact , he could distinguish among the cats in a way he had 89 never been able to do before  --  not that he had ever tried 14 ) read an animal 's mind . The level of pain varied from vat to cat , with the larger of the two females being most distressed by the sensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pa i c - around him . As Mather pushed his awareness fur t her to include other life forms in the hold , he was Warded to realize that the pain extended to himself alai the Rangers as well  --  though theirs was not nearly as intense as the cats ' and registered only as mild but fx rs is tent headaches . More than a little curious at that , and able to block his own pain now that he had become aware of it , M ; -t her broadened his sensitivity to read the inanimate Nt rcicture of the hold itself , sweeping his attention over 11w cages , the equipment , even the bulkheads , searching Mr something , anything out of the ordinary that might account for the pain he was reading from both lets and men . I le missed it the first time around . He almost missed it the second . But just before he was about to t- v a third sweep , he detected a blur of psychic noise to his right that grated like a fingernail on stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inspecting the suspect bulkhead and integrating optical input with psychic . Another stanchion rose directly across from him , similar to the one whose shadow camouflaged him . The psychic static he had finally brought into focus seemed to be coming from that direction . Still psychically open , Mather roused his body and forced it to move cautiously toward the place in question , bracing one hand against the bulkheads at his right , blocking the screams of the cats at his left , each careful step a conscious act . Bending to peer behind the bulk of the stanchion , he hesitated only briefly before extending his hand tentatively toward a flat , featureless gray box the size of his open palm ; it clung to the back of the metal support . Though he did not touch it , he knew instantly that somehow the box was the source of the pain he had been reading . With a blink , he was back in normal consciousness , the cats ' screams reverberating at his back . He took a deep breath as he straightened and glanced toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rangers were still engrossed in their own duties and probably had not even noticed his silence or his stealth , but Perelli was watching him curiously . " Perelli , would you come here , please ? " Perelli said something to the two Rangers at the door , then came on the run . Mather took out his pocket medscanner and made an adjustment as the man approached ; then he dropped down on his hunkers to point behind the stanchion with bland detachment . " Ever seen that before ? " Perelli looked , then gestured for one of the other Rangers by the door and shook his head as the other man came and gave a similarly negative response . " And you 're sure that no one has been around the cats ? " Mather insisted , running his scanner close above the box 's gray crackle finish and studying the readouts.  | " Only authorized personnel , sir , " Perelli replied , zzled . " Webb and Wing are still going over the tapes , t  --  you do n't think it 's a bomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor does it appear to be booby-trapped to event what I 'm about to do . " I le handed the scanner to Perelli , then touched the x gingerly with a fingertip before using both hands slide it sideways and pry loose the limpet seal holdg it in place . The device was featureless but for two Slightly sunken screw heads on the underside , both f t i r t ly glowing red . " Well , well , " Mather muttered to himself , reaching to an inner jacket pocket for a flat , narrow case as the o Rangers looked on with interest . Balancing the case on one knee , he extracted a 91 nder , nonmetallic probe , the blade of which he fitted Itcately to the right-hand screw and gave a minute u n to the left . The result was far more dramatic than he had xlirc  --  led . As the screw moved , the cats immediately Slopped screaming ; but the watching Rangers gasped nil clutched at their heads in pain so intense that they N-c r Ic 1 not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell his knees . criickly Mather turned the screw in the opposite rec  --  t ion , relieving the Rangers and momentarily enaging the cats again  --  and then , nothing . The screw lopped glowing , the cats stopped screaming , and the angers could finally blurt out a few dazed words of t rc i c r i ry as to what had happened . Igtwring their questions for just a moment longer , M athrr tightened down the other screw until it , too , thorned glowing  --  fortunately , without further ill effect On those around him . He did not bother to speculate as $i- wiry he had not been affected , but it was fortunate r had not  --  for , judging by the Rangers ' reactions , he doubted he could have functioned coherently enough 11- rrrntralize the device if he had been .  | Wing and a shaken-looking Webb came running from the adjoining security room . They were followed by the Rangers who had been sleeping and Perelli 's other partner from the door . Casey 's voice finally began to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! What did you do ? " " What 's going on , Commodore ? " Wing echoed . " We were running the last of the tapes , and I thought the top of my head was going to come off ! " " Mine , too , " said Casey . " I 've never felt anything like that in my life ! What was it , sir ? " Mather replaced his probe in its case and got ponderously to his feet , controlling the tendency of his knees to go a little wobbly in after-reaction . " Apparently , someone has left us a not-so-friendly gift , " he said , hefting the box in his hand as he slipped the instrument case back inside his jacket . " As nearly as I can tell without further analysis , it 's a psychic irritator of some sort , designed to focus random psychotronic energy and then disperse it on specific frequencies . In this case , it was tuned to enrage the cats and to hover just at the edge of human awareness  --  which would account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general irritability experienced by almost everyone who 's had to work near the cats for any length of time since we came aboard . Call it a psychic itch , if that 's a good image for you . " " But , where did it come from , sir ? " asked Peterson , Perelli 's second partner . " No one 's been in here , except our people and ship 's security , since we brought the cats aboard . " " The tapes confirm that , Wing ? " " Yes , sir . There 's been absolutely no unauthorized entry . " " I see . " Mather thought for a moment . Then : " Mister Webb , how clear a view did you actually have of this area on the tapes ? "  | Webb blinked and glanced at Wing , at the other Ra  --  gers , and back at Mather . " Are you asking if I think One ? of us could have planted the device , sir ? " " I 'm asking you to eliminate that possibility for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back through the tapes and kee who , if anyone , had the opportunity to place such a device ? I 'm going to have to give Captain Lutobo some kind of report , after all , even if it 's a negative one . " " We 'll see to it sir , " Webb said . " Is there anything e , . ? " Mather pursed his lips in thought , then glanced at r cats , now sitting or lying peacefully in their cages . ne of the males was grooming a huge blue paw with Willed nonchalance . The other male and his mate Were observing the activities of the humans with bored Indifference . The fourth cat had opted for a nap , and Ovr ; - sional snorts of contentment came from her end of the cage . All eyes turned to follow Mather 's line of attention , then returned to him questioningly . Mather 's lips compressed in a grim line as he hefted the device in his hand . " As a matter of fact , there is something else that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nets that we did n't use on I1 Nuadi ? I think it 's time we broke those out and set up a new perimeter . " " Aye , sir , I can do that , " Wing said with a nod . He kicked puzzled . " But  --  is it true , what security said ? that someone was murdered , and the evidence points In c.  --  r cats ? " Mather sighed , glancing back at the cats reflectively . " That 's the way security is reading the evidence , " he conceded , " though there has to be another explanation . Doctor Hamilton is working on the autopsy with the ship 's surgeon right now . Since I 'm going to have to answer to Captain Lutobo far sooner than I 'd like , I do n't suppose anyone wishes to change his statement am to unusual occurrences here in the hold since last night ' ? "  | No one did . There was some nervous shuffling of feet , a cough or two , but each man continued to look directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledgment of his faith in their competence . " Thank you , gentlemen . That 's the response I expected , but you understand why I had to ask . Mister Fredricks , I 'll ask you and Neville to help Wing with the new perimeter setup , since you 're both fresh . Peterson , you go on the tapes with Webb . Casey will have to man the door lock alone for now . " " Very good , sir . " " And Perelli , " Mather continued as the others began dispersing to attend to their new assignments , " per94 haps you can help me with something else . I want to take our gadget up to engineering and run some tests before I have to confront the captain . Who 's their best electronics expert ? Who helped build these earmuffs ? " As he pulled the headset from around his neck and handed it to Perelli , the Ranger shook his head . " We worked with a Wes Brinson , sir . But I ca n't guarantee he 's ever seen anything like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had . " Mather smiled . " Frankly , I 'll settle for an open mind and some cooperation . " He whistled a grim little tune under his breath as he left the hold and headed for the crew lift , fielding the questions of the waiting security men with a polite but firm " No comment " and picking up his escort again , in the process . The rest stayed to keep watch on the cats . In Shivaun Shannon 's surgery , meanwhile , the situation had deteriorated badly . Wallis 's and her confrontation with the Aludrans quickly escalated to the point that Shannon was ready to call security to escort the aliens from the room , except that Captain Lutobo arrived  --  and he called the guards . Within three minutes the aliens were gone , Lutobo  | ( 1 viewed the body of the victim , and an abashed tel of security was trying in vain to explain what his ? en had been doing instead of protecting the ship 's msengers . Lutobo was not inclined toward charity Ihtti rnorning . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eel ( 1 be this incompetent , Mister Courtenay . " Lutobo Wits raging , and Shannon wished she could disappear 11 r r c n rgh the floor . " A Lehr cat is not a small animal . I want to know how a creature that large could have lade its way from the cargo level to Deck Three , and ek , without anyone seeing it . " " We 're looking for additional witnesses , Captain , " of r r t enay began , " but I only have so many men . " " For all the witnesses you 've found , it does n't ap ? ar it makes any difference how many men you have ! " lrtobo retorted . " And Doctor Shannon , according to rru testimony , the victim was still alive when Lord Ider-ton found him . From the damage done to the body , how long could Fabrial have survived , between Ilse attack and his death ? I ca n't imagine that even a la  --  Irr- ( sat could move that fast , in that kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does n't anyone have any answers ? " Shannon toyed with a power probe she had picked tap from beside the now covered body of Fabrial , and ( ' cerrtenay shifted uneasily from one foot to the other , trot daring to drop his attitude of attention . Wallis had 1 t 1 ( . ( l to make herself as unobtrusive as possible behind the draped body , for she had no more answers than Shannon or Courtenay , but her reprieve was shortlived . " Well , Doctor Hamilton ? I have n't heard you offering any brilliant explanations . And where is Commoilorc ? Seton ? " " I believe he 's gone to check on the cats , Captain . We 're aware how the situation must appear . I expect word from him at any moment . "  | " You say that as if there were some doubt of who 's to blame , " Lutobo retorted , moving to the intercom and punching the call button . " ComNet ? " " ComNet here . " " This is the Captain . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cargo hold where his damned cats are berthed . " " Stand by , please , Captain . " As the tally light beside the Gruening logo went from red to amber , the captain glanced at Wallis again . " Come , now , Doctor . Speechless ? I seem to recall being reassured by your people , several times , that this could never happen . I suppose it does make a difference when one has seen the mangled body of a victim , 96 however . Even the most calloused ? " At the sound of a chime , the tally light went to red again and the image of a uniformed crewman appeared on the screen . The man was half turned away from the video pickup , but the permanent legend across the bottom of the screen identified the location as Engineering Section . As the crewman moved aside , Mather Seton stepped into frame . " I thought you 'd be with your Lehr cats , Commodore , " Lutobo said icily , not waiting for Mather to speak first . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mather , a look of resigned patience on his face , had held up a gray , metallic box with several wires trailing from it . " I found it in the hold with the cats , Captain . We did n't place it here . Regarding the cats , I did not find any sign of blood , a fight , or tampering with the cages . Nor , according to your own security scanners and the testimonies of your and my men , has anything happened in the hold in the past twelve hours that could be construed as unusual in any way  --  which the exit of one of the cats certainly would be . Furthermore , your people tell me they 've never seen this thing before , or even anything like it . I have my Rangers rechecking the  | c  --  ccrity tapes now , just to see who even had the opporluiiity to plant it . " The captain glanced at Wallis and Shannon , both w standing to one side of him , then stared suspiously at the object in Mather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Seton. hat is that ? " " Apparently , it 's a psychic irritator , " Mather replied . It : s a very sophisticated device , just to make a few Lehr is feisty . It transmits psychotronic energy on a fairly rrow band . In this case , it was set on a frequency at would be irritating to the cats  --  and to humaotcis , to varying degrees  --  but that could not be specifiIly detected otherwise , unless one knew precisely hat to look for . Incidentally , this tends to confirm that hi . cats do scream telepathically , Wallis , though I 'll still alit to check that aspect more specifically , when we havc the time . " But even though the screaming may have had sonic effect on those within the cats ' broadcast range ? probably a few hundred meters , at most  --  I suspect that we 'll find the bulk of the irritation  --  to the cats , the Crcw , and probably the Aludrans  --  was due to this transmitter . " " The Aludrans ? " Lutobo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you trying to tell me that they may also have ber-c affected by that device ? " Mather cocked his head thoughtfully . " That 's possible ? . It 's just occurred to me that their cabins are on Level Five , right above the cargo deck  --  maybe even right above our hold . That could certainly explain last night . I thought at the time that Muon 's reaction was a little excessive to be entirely self-induced . Wally , does that sound plausible to you ? " " Well , they are slightly telepathic already , so it nukes sense that they 'd be more susceptible to that kind of transmission , " Wallis said . " And with Muon being a seer ... "  | Lutobo rubbed a hand across his jaw and frowned . " Well , could the Aludrans have  --  damn it , you two ! You 're getting me away from the point . The Aludrans did n't kill Fabrial ! I do n't see how the cats could have done it , either , but that 's the only evidence we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that device in the hold , Captain ? " Mather asked . " And why ? " " Well , it certainly was n't the Aludrans ! " Lutobo replied . " We all know they 're afraid of the cats . They certainly would n't want to do anything to stir them up . " Shannon folded her arms across her chest in speculation . " But remember what Doctor Torrell said about cat legends at dinner last night , Captain . We know that the Aludrans see the cats of their own mythical tradition as demons . Maybe their own discomfort was worth it , to make the cats miserable . " " Doctor , you 're beginning to sound like those two ! " Lutobo snapped , gesturing toward Wallis and the electronic image of Mather . " The next thing I know , one of you will be trying to tell me that the cats are n't involved in this at all . " " Your own technology suggests their innocence , Captain , " Mather said . Lutobo 's jaw tightened and he said nothing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and looked directly at Mather 's image . " I ca n't account for that just now , Commodore . I do know one thing , however . I want the guard doubled around those cats . " " I 've already stepped up security , Captain . From now until we reach Tersel , I intend to allow no one besides my Rangers , Wallis , and myself inside the cats ' hold . I 'm also having additional restraining devices installed around the cages , just to reassure you that the cats can not possibly be involved in what happened . "  | " Yes , well , " the captain said lamely . " I  --  ah  --  also Intend to confine the Aludrans to their quarters until wt. reach Tersel . And if I could detain certain other people " ? he glanced pointedly at Wallis , then glared Into the viewscreen ? " you can be sure that I would . As It is , I sincerely hope that both of you will stay out of my way and out of the affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tor , Commodore ? " Mather 's bland expression betrayed none of his undoubted annoyance . " I understand perfectly , Captain . If you do n't mind , I wish to run some additional tests on this device , here In engineering . After that , if it is your wish , I shall w i t hdraw as much as possible . " " Just make sure nothing else happens , Commodore ! " Lutobo said , before he punched the button to ' break the circuit . As the screen went to black , the captain cast one lst , disapproving glance at the two physicians , then turned on his heel and stalked out of the surgery . Shannon , with an apologetic shrug of her shoulders , picked up a scalpel and began pulling back the drapes on the body of Fabrial . " Doctor Hamilton , if you wish to stay for the remainder of this autopsy , I wo n't ask you to leave , " she maid quietly , not looking up . " This is my surgery , and I ( let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I would n't want you to get in trouble with your captain , " Wallis said carefully . Shannon gave her a wry , sidelong glance and tiny *mile . " He did n't order you out of here . He simply expressed the hope that you would stay out of his way . I do n't see him around , do you ? " Wallis could hardly argue that point . With a faint KI she moved to the other side of the table and pulled an overhead light closer , losing herself for the next little while in the buzz of force probes , the whirr of suction  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | " Violence is completely at odds with their philosophy . That does n't mean that someone else could n't have tried to frame the cats , though . " " But why ? " Shannon sighed . " Dammit , Wallis . maybe the cats did somehow manage to get out and hunt ! Torrell says that almost every culture has myths about supernatural cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racked their brains . They sat in Shannon 's office for over an hour after orderlies had come to take Fabrial 's body away to cold storage and tried to establish some possible motive for his murder , even if they could not assign suspects to those motivations . In desperation , they pulled Gustav Fabrial 's files and set up a computer run to correlate his background against that of everyone else on the ship who had known or had contact with him . They went over their medical findings again and again . " Try this , " Shannon said , as they sipped hot tea in her office . " You 're fairly sure the cats are telepathic screamers . Is it possible that telepathy is not their only psychic talent ? " " What did you have in mind ? " " I do n't know . Maybe some kind of memory-erase ? To a certain extent , we can do that with machines , Maybe the cats can do it naturally . " " Or " ? Wallis raised an eyebrow thoughtfully ? " maybe some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Who has access to yours , besides your-self ? " " Just Deller . We have two machines , but no one eke is authorized to use them . And it takes a thumbprint to key them . Also , there 's an automatic record made each time either one is used ; falsifying it would be very difficult , if not impossible . " " It is n't impossible , " Wallis said quietly , " believe men . However , I 'd think it is impossible to have all seven of our Rangers up here , plus your security guards , wiih- It someone noticing such a mass troop movement d without at least one of them remembering someI ? g odd . Are the machines portable ? ? Shannon shook her head . " Not readily . What you e above the tables is only part of the apparatus . The st is built into the wall . " Wallis nodded thoughtfully . " That 's fairly standard . I.rt 's get back to the cats , then . Unless they 're a whole lot more sophisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see how they could change or erase the perceptions of trained observers without being detected . The ps in continuity would stand out like supernovas. " " flow about mass hallucinations , then ? " Shannon ked . " What if only one cat gets out at a time  --  do n't k , ne how  --  and the others somehow create the im- 105 scion that he 's still there . No gaps , that way . " " True , " Wallis conceded . " And a hunter who can ke his prey think he 's where he 's not  --  that could be ry useful . " She shook her head and sighed . " But nniperial Rangers and trained security specialists are Iu-t the same as game animals , Shivaun . I think my torn would know , even if yours did n't . Besides , nothing like that happened on B-Gem . " Shannon had to agree . For several seconds neither woman spoke , each lost in thought , until finally Wallis , ked up and cocked her head to the side . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's farfetched , and it 's going to sound as if I 'm conceding that the cats might be reaponsible for Fabrial 's murder , but there are a couple of I , rol , le aboard that we might talk to , who know a lot more about Lehr cats than Mather and I do . Vander ' h-n t 'll is one of them . You heard him expounding on the lost race of Il Nuadi last night at dinner . " One of the more boorish men it 's been my misfort i to to meet , " Shannon observed with a grimace . " I 6-11't suppose I should say that about a passenger , but hm-t h I ng in my contract says I have to like them all . . Come to think of it , he did n't seem to care much for  | you and Commodore Seton , either . " Wallis shrugged . " There 's some cause , I suppose . Mather and I exerted quite a lot of pressure , trying to persuade him to join our expedition . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was hoping you might talk to him . " " Me ? " Shannon rolled her eyes . " The things I do in the line of duty . Who 's our other expert ? " Wallis smiled across at her unperturbed . " Believe me , you 've got the better end of the bargain . I thought I 'd pay a call on Lorcas Reynal . He boarded at B-Gem , too , but I do n't think you 've met him yet . He keeps pretty much to himself . He was born on I1 Nuadi , as he prefers to call it , and he was a member of our expedition , albeit a less than enthusiastic one . He did n't think we should capture the cats , and he especially did n't want to see them taken off-planet . " " Then why did he help catch them ? " Wallis grinned . " Filthy lucre . Our fee would have been very hard to turn down  --  and he did n't . He 's something of a cultural anthropologist  --  mostly selfeducated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's using his ill-gotten gains to finance a sabbatical on Wezen I , where your friend Torrell did his work . That 's why he 's aboard . But once the cats were captured and he 'd been paid , he made it perfectly clear that he wanted nothing further to do with us . Still , he might be able to tell us something . " " Are n't able ' and ' willing ' two different matters , in this case ? " Shannon asked . " Probably . But at least I ought to try  --  and I 've got a better chance than Mather would of learning something . The two of them had a running battle  --  verbal , fortunately  --  almost from the first day we arrived on 13-Gem . A few of our younger Rangers seemed to get along with him a little better , but even that was a strained truce , at times . " " Then why did you keep him on ? "  | " He knew how to track Lehr cats . Men like that are rare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her console and punched up a medical record . The name at the top was Lorcas Reynal . " I think I know where to find Torrell , this time of day , " Shannon said , skimming down the readout . " You 'll probably find Reynal in his cabin  --  number thirty-nine , Deck Three . I see he 's not a well man  --  but I expect you knew that . He asked for a sterile atmosphere in his cabin , which we gave him . He also wears a contagion force field most of the time . His record says he 's extremely susceptible to out side infection off his own planet . " " I think he 's a hypochondriac more than anything else , " Wallis said , getting to her feet , " besides being a master of insults in several different languages . " " Well , if you think there 's going to be any problem , I eats send someone from security with you , but they 're all a little busy right now , " Shannon said . Wallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up a ICI tiger on the way and meet you back here when we 're finished . " At Reynal 's cabin , Wallis buzzed four times before get t ing a response . She had begun to think Reynal was out after all , but it was his familiar , unpleasant face that came up abruptly on the door viewer . He did not appear at all pleased , and Wallis suddenly was very glad N lle had not come alone . " Good morning , Mister Reynal . Or perhaps I should w ry good afternoon , since it 's past lunchtime . May we come in for a moment ? " Reynal eyed both of them suspiciously , then f ht n Imbed the door control and stood aside as the door Mlici back . He gestured reluctantly for Wallis and Wing to enter . The room was chilly , the lights very low . As Wing took it upon himself to bring up the lights , Wallis was reminded again how unpleasant-looking Reynal  | was . Tall and long-limbed , almost painfully thin , with dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seemed almost a caricature of a man , even though he was of human stock . " Say what you have to say , Doctor , and then please leave , " Reynal said . " I thought I made it clear before we left Il Nuadi that I have nothing further to say to you . " " Believe me , the feeling is mutual , " Wallis said . " except that I need some additional information about the Lehr cats . There was some trouble earlier this morning , as you may have heard . Some questions have been raised . " Reynal shifted his cold eyes from Wallis to Wing . then back to Wallis . " Did I not warn you that the 108 animals were unpredictable , Doctor , and should not be taken off II Nuadi ? I take no responsibility for their behavior . " " No one said that it was your responsibility , Mister Reynal , " Wallis replied . " However , we learned this morning , to our very great surprise , that the cats scream telepathically as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other psychic accomplishments you have n't told us about  --  like the ability to teleport out of their cages or something . If you could ? " " I could do many things , if I wished , Doctor , " Reynal said stonily . " However , I do not wish . My responsibility for the creatures , and to you , ended when the terms of my contract were fulfilled . I am not required to remind myself constantly that I sold my integrity for money . " " You were paid handsomely , Reynal , " Wing said . " Paid in Imperial credits  --  yes , " Reynal snapped . " But eventually , it is I who shall have to pay with the coin of my soul , for having betrayed the Shining Ones . I shall not betray them again . " " Reynal , they 're animals , " Wallis said . " Clever animals , perhaps  --  maybe more clever than we know  --  but they 're not gods . And one of them may have killed  | someone on this ship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no concern to - nc . " " Now , see here , Reynal ? " Wing began . " I do not need to see anywhere , Lieutenant , " Reynal interrupted coldly . " You are the intruder here , not I. Now , if you will excuse me , I was on my way out . l I-iless , of course , you plan to detain me illegally . " With a perplexed sigh , Wallis moved toward the door , tapping Wing on the elbow as she passed . " Never  --  - Ind , Wing . Mister Reynal is under no obligation to assist us further , if he does n't want to . As he has so succinctly pointed out , he has honored his contract already . My apologies for having disturbed you , Mister Itrynal . " Nor did Shannon have much better luck . She found Vander Torrell winning at Four-Card Deltikan in the ship 's casino , but the historian was understandably - rluctant to abandon his game . After several hands in which he began to lose , however , Torrell sourly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had been waiting and watching him . He drained one Tejat brandy and ordered a second before he would look at her . " Now that you 've thoroughly destroyed my winning streak , Doctor , what can I do for you ? I 'm not at all iu  --  c ? t-stomed to having my game interrupted . " " I 'm sorry to inconvenience you , Doctor Torrell . I was fascinated by something you said at dinner last t-igh t . " ' Ibrrell glanced at her as if really seeing her for the It , st time behind the maroon uniform . " Oh , and what thing was that , Doctor ? " " Something you said about the Lehr cats and their t flat ionship with the lost race of II Nuadi . I wondered II " Ah , wait , Doctor . Do n't tell me . Let me guess , " he  | said unctuously . " The persistent Commodore Seton has sent you to pump me for information , has n't he ? " " Commodore Seton knows nothing about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least , was true . " But the Lehr cats are of special interest to me just now . I hoped you might be able to help me . " " Ah , yes , I heard about the little problem with the cats this morning . Naturally , you would have medical interest , would n't you ? Ah , such an unfortunate occurrence . " " Unfortunate enough for you to tell me more about Lehr cats ? " Shannon countered . Torrell smiled and covered her hand with his on the table top , leaning forward conspiratorily when she did not pull away . " Well , perhaps we could discuss it over drinks . What would you like to know , dear lady ? " And at the murder site , his mission concluded with the engineering section , Mather had been pursuing his own lines of investigation . It was always a pleasure to watch professionals doing their jobs well , and the forensic specialist of the security team , an elderly man named Jones , was definitely a pro . Mather chatted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered his samples and quietly questioned the guards who had been first at the scene . When Jones had left , Mather wandered closer to the murder site itself . One of the cleanup crew was rubbing at a particularly stubborn stain just where the body had lain . Casually , Mather crouched down beside the man . " Looks like hard work , " he remarked . The man glanced at him amiably and continued scrubbing at the carpet . " Just this one spot , sir . I think Jonesie must 've splashed some fixative here when he was taking his samples . Most of the blood washed right out , though  --  and there really was n't that much of it , considering what happened . I guess the poor devil  | Whist have died from internal hemorrhaging . " " Oh ? " Mather tried to keep an interested edge out of his voice . " It looked like a pretty bloody affair to me . " The man shrugged . " I 've seen worse . Two runs back , we had a couple of drunks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salon , and you should 've seen the mess . The place looked like a slaughterhouse by the tliiie security could break it up , but they both lived to talk about it . " " What about this one ? " Mather urged . " Oh , not this guy . He was definitely dead . There was n't that much blood , though . An easy cleanup job . " Mather glanced around him at the drying carpet , then back at the man . " How much blood do you think he lost ? " " How much ? " The man stopped scrubbing and looked around him , then said , " Oh , half a liter or so , if that . When it 's spread out , it can look like a lot more , hiit  --  half a liter , maybe . Certainly no more . " " I see . " Mather slipped the man a sharply creased note . " Thanks very much . You 've been very helpful . " Within minutes , he was approaching Medical Seclion . The reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shannon laughing behind a door that was partially ajar . With a quick knock , he slid the door open enough to pass , then let it glide closed behind him . Wallis had her feet up on Shannon 's desk , and Shannon was washing her hands at a scrub sink across the room . They both grinned at him as he s t t led into a chair opposite his wife . " Shivaun was just telling me about her near-capture at the hands of the notorious Van-der Tor-rell , " Wallis said , intoning the name with mock solemnity . " I sent her to see if she could get any more information out of him about Lehr cats , and he decided it was really an attempt to get to know him better . " " Ugh , what a slimy character ! " Shannon said , drying her hands and chucking the towel into a waste  | chute . " I found out some interesting things , though How about you ? Did the lab come up with anything on your gray box yet ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crackle finish did n't take prints very well . All they got were a few of mine , badly smudged . I doubt they 'll have much better luck on the inside . All the components are either handmade or else they 've had the manufacturers ' marks removed . We may be able to restore some of the marks , but I doubt that will be much help , either . I 've got them running function analyses of the circuits now . " " Well , you did n't really think they 'd be able to tell us much anyway , did you ? " Wallis asked . " No . How about you two ? Did you determine the cause of death ? " Shannon sat down behind her desk and picked up a stylus . " Vascular collapse , caused by massive loss of blood . Of course , we could have told you that after the first look . " " And the wounds ? " Mather persisted . " Other than the throat wound , mostly superficial . really . Much worse-looking than they actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any major organ , and certainly none that should have been fatal  --  other than the throat , of course . He simply bled to death . " " I see . And how much blood would you say he lost . for it to be enough to kill him ? " " Oh , two or three liters , given his other injuries and the amount of blood left in the body . Maybe more  --  he was a good-sized man . Why do you ask ? " " Intriguing , " Mather said , by way of reply . " Tell me . Doctor , you never actually saw the murder site , did you ? Or photos ? " " Not yet . Why ? " " Because I just talked to one of your cleanup crew ,  | cl he can only account for about half a liter of blood at r site . What do you suppose happened to the other o liters or so ? " Shannon stopped toying with her stylus and looked 1 him oddly . " What are you trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autopsy findings are grossly inacrate , which I doubt . Wally , does this suggest a patn to you  --  what I 've just told you ? " " About the missing blood ? " She looked quizzically I Mather , her auburn head cocked to one side in - Trilled suspicion as she guessed where he was lead . " You 're serious , are n't you ? You really want me to it ? " " I am deadly serious . " " Oh , my . Well , since we ca n't account for the missg blood at the murder site or in the victim 's body , it minds as if someone or something has either contt wd or carried off the rest of the blood . If the cats are KI ) onsible , which is n't likely , it 's obviously the ** . If a human , probably the latter . " She paused a " Mather Seton , you do n't really want me to tell hivaun she 's got a vampire on her ship , do you ? "  | page deleted  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And even discounting supernatural explanations , there are physiological and psychological bases for behavior patterns that simulate at least portions of activity we 've come to associate with vampirism . Certain chemical deficiencies and imbalances in the body can lead to very bizarre behavior , as I 'm sure you know . And psychotic individuals have been known to believe they were almost anything  --  and to act accordingly . Why not a vampire ? " Shannon hugged her arms across her chest as if suddenly chilled and hunched down in her chair . " This is ridiculous . You 've almost got me believing you ! There has to be a more plausible explanation . " Mather shrugged . " I 'd certainly welcome one . But when we 're dealing with a situation this bizarre , an no more logical explanation seems likely , then we nee to consider bizarre possibilities . Now , either the cat are responsible , as our gross physical evidence indi cates  --  except that we ca n't figure out how they did it or else someone is trying to make it look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away to make it appe that the cats drank it  --  which is not an altogethe unexpected behavior for carnivores like the Lehr cats . Or he 's consuming it himself and making it look lik the cats did it . " " Or the murderer is carrying away the blood an then consuming it , " Wallis added . " Or he 's flushing it down the toilet ! " Shanno snapped . " Also possible , " Mather agreed . " And a true psych might be doing it with no thought of implicating th cats at all . It could be just coincidence . But the blood has to go somewhere . " He cocked his head at Shannon wistfully . " I think you 'll have to admit that the basic vampire theory has merits in this case , Doctor ? ' vam ? pire ' covering the whole range of what we 've been discussing , of course . At least it gives us another angle to consider . "  | Shannon glanced nervously at both of them again , rr brow furrowed in concentration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I understand what you 're trying to - . You want to clear your cats , and I ca n't say I blame  --  - . But this  --  theory of yours  --  I 'm sorry , I just ca n't Nrcrpt it . " " Well , it 's as useful as all the other theories we 've considered , " Wallis said , " which is to say they all stink . Cs sleep on it , shall we ? And do n't we have another use jump coming up soon ? " Wearily , Shannon glanced at the chronometer on rr console and sighed . " Yes . I had n't realized it was so le . You 've got about twenty minutes . Commodore , if - c-  still want to try that new suspension system , you 119 i- speak to Technician Gallinos , two doors down . She n set you up for it . " As she punched up a display on the console , obvi1sly dismissing them , Mather murmured , " Thank I- , " and started to make an additional comment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mather , with nigh , got up and left the room , Wallis following behind 1  --  - . When they had gone , Shannon turned to stare unr.isily at the door for a long time , stirring only when hr lights dimmed momentarily and the phase warnfig to chime its five-minute signal . She sat up at that , long enough to shake a tiny , - sr- colored tablet from a dispenser in her desk ewer . Then she laid her head against the back of her - hair and slipped the tablet under her tongue . She could feel it taking effect as the one-minute warning Vibrated through the ship ; she relaxed and let the II%r ( lic  --  ation do its work , wondering idly what it would br like to jump unmedicated  --  wondering how Wallis Hamilton managed it with no ill effects whatsoever . So Nbsc ) rt ed was she in her speculation that the jump itmrll passed almost unnoticed . She dozed afterward  --  she could not remember later  | whether she had dreamed or not  --  but she awoke fretting about what the Setons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plague her as she tried to finish the day 's entries in her medical log . An orderly brought a tray with dinner , and she poked at the food for a while , but she was not hungry , despite the day 's exhaustion . Major Barding floated in for his pain medication and was again in high spirits , once the drugs began to take effect . But Shannon sent him on his way far more brusquely than she had intended . Twice she started to request information from the library banks ; twice canceled the request . Finally , when Deller came to relieve her , she cleared the board altogether and went back to her cabin to try to sleep . But sleep would not come , despite all her efforts to drop off . Finally , feeling annoyed with herself and quite foolish , she got out of bed and padded over to the library terminal on her desk . The only illumination was the single tally light on the intercom unit beside the terminal . She stared at that for several minutes before finally reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and the display screen glowed a soft green , casting an eerie pallor on her face and hands . Slowly , and feeling even more foolish than before , she typed out her request . Reference , vampires . General knowledge . Respond . After what seemed to be minutes  --  unthinkable in a sophisticated device such as the library computer  --  the response began scrolling up the screen . Vampire , from the Earth Slavic vampir . A mythological being believed to arise from the dead at night to drink the blood of its victim . The phenomenon of vampirism appears in many cultures , both human and alien . ( See mythologies of specific cultures for non-Earth traditions . ) The best-known vampire in Earth mythology was Count Dracula , a fictional creation of 19th-century  | littlish author Bram Stoker . ( See Stoker , Bram . Dran rla . Menkar : The Literary Reprint Series , Society for the Preservation of Ancient Classics , A.I. 63 . ) However , there is evidence to suggest that Stoker based his character on actual folk superstitions prevalent long before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stoker 's creation was a curious mix111 re ofl3ored with the historical recounting , Shannon hit Ihv cancel button and keyed the query again . This thine , her question was more specific . Reference , vampires . State characteristics of appearance and behavior . Respond . Again , a seemingly endless pause before the information came up . The unvarying characteristic of all vampires was the presence of elongated upper canine teeth , sometimes retractable . These the vampire would sink into his victim 's neck over the jugular vein . He would then drain blood from his victim  --  whether by simply drinking it or by drawing it out directly through hollow passages in the teeth is not always clear . This could occur all at once , causing almost immediate ( loath , or it could be stretched out in a series of ( attacks over a period of days or even weeks , until the 1OIc  --  ti-n eventually expired , the cause of death usually blamed on one or another of the wasting malaises common to that era of beginning medical knowledge .

All vampires must return to a coffin arl their native earth before sunrise , sunlight being /cacti to their kind . l lcr attention engaged in spite of herself , Shannon : r.ni on , fascinated by the breadth of the vampire c nr leapt and checking the information against what ther and Wallis had told her .  | Legendary sources indicate that vampires were able to transfix their victims with a hypnotic stare , often forming an obsessive bond that led the victim to aid the vampire in gaining access to his or her person . There are also indications that victims may have derived sensual pleasure from their liaisons with vampires , though this was rarely stated clearly in the repressive literature of contemporary authors . However , it should be noted that vampires generally ( though not always ) chose victims of the opposite sex , especially if the draining of blood was to be prolonged over a period of time . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Old Earth . Tersel : Journal of the Institute of Psychiatric Research , A.I. 82. ) 122 Vampires were believed to live forever , so long as their sources of fresh blood were not curtailed , and to confer immortality on those of their victims who became vampires . They could take the form of bats or sometimes other animals . Vampires also had the ability to turn into vapor and thus pass unseen through locked doors and walls . They were possessed of superhuman strength . Because they were believed to have no souls , it was thought that their reflections could not be seen in mirrors . They disliked garlic and garlic flowers , which acted as a repellent , and could not stand the touch of a cross or of silver . They could not cross running water or enter a house unless invited by " This is ridiculous ! " Shannon whispered , hitting the cancel button again . For a moment she sat staring at the faintly glowing screen . Then she tried one last query . Reference , vampires . State methods for destroying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be destroyed by : exposure to direct sunlight ; branding with a cross , especially one made of silver ; dousing with holy water ; pounding of a  | ) oden stake , preferably of ash , through the heart ; urning .

It was sheer superstition . It had to be . And yet , something Wallis Hamilton had said kept flashing through her mind : that almost all legends have some basis in fact . For several minutes she sat there in darkness , staring at the blank glow of the display screen as if it might impart some new wisdom that she could accept more readily . Instead , her imagination embellished what she ad read and sent chill shivers down her spine . She natty turned off the console altogether and stalked 123 back to bed , determined to put it all out of mind and go to sleep . She did sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angrily , more than once , to hazy recollections of silver crosses , garlic flowers  --  whatever they were ! ? and wooden stakes piercing hearts that did not beat . Mather and Wallis also got some sleep eventually ? though not before checking on the cats a final time . Wallis went directly there , to nurse the animals through any aftereffects from the phase shift , but Mat her rode out the jump in one of the new suspensors , as Shannon had suggested . " It did cancel out the usual discomforts of jumpg , " he informed Wallis afterward , when he had joined her in the hold , " but I lost consciousness for a few seconds . I could do without that . " " I3ut you were n't nauseous or dizzy ? " Wallis asked . " I ) : - cling , that 's wonderful ! I wonder if it would help our lurry friends . This jump was a lot harder on them than he last time . " She gestured toward the cats , who were all slumped flat in the bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their heads , much less scream . " Well , first you 'd have to get them into the harness . " Mather quipped . " Seriously , though , I 'm afraid the thing is still very experimental . It did mean one less jump I had to suffer through , however . And if Lutobo is still speaking to me by morning , I plan to run the navigation coordinates to see if we ca n't refine his figures and eliminate another one . We might make up some of his lost time , too . " " Well , it might improve his temper , " Wallis agreed . " Do you think the suspensors are worth trying again ? " Mather grinned . " Well , not for that jump , of course , And I do n't know that they 'd ever work out for military use . It 's one thing for a civilian to pass out for a feW minutes and avoid the usual after-grogginess front medication , but that would n't do at all in a battld situation . " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anymore , darling , " Wallis murmured , patting hi arm with affection . " If you want to use the suspensors you go right ahead . " " Woman , if you keep patronizing me about that , I banish you from my bed and board ! " Mather muttered though he smiled as he said it . " It is n't my fault tha you got the right genes to make you immune to jum sickness . " Wallis grinned . " Poor baby . Are you satisfied wit security , so we can go get some sleep ? " " I do n't see what else we can do , " he replied . " Mist Neville , the shift is yours . " " Aye , sir . I 've got a few more things I want to inst so there ca n't be any question . " " Fine . We 'll see you in the morning . " But though their sleep was not marred by night mares the way Shannon 's was , nor were they permit t to rest as long as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rasp of the door buzzer jarred them from sleep . Mather , honed to the expectation of possible trouble by  | long years ' experience , was awake instantly . He saw Wallis roll over and peer at him sleepily as he eased out of bed and glided silently to the door speaker . He glanced at the chronometer beside the speaker and yawned before thumbing the button . " Seton . " " Commodore , this is Courtenay , chief of security . 1'r  --  sorry to have to bother you so early , but the captain wants to see you and Doctor Hamilton in his office Inrrnediately . " Mather felt every muscle in his body tense and had to force himself to relax by conscious will . He laid an arm around Wallis 's shoulder as she came to stand ' silently beside him . " I gather that the captain 's request has the force of Itl order , as far as you 're concerned , Mister Courte- 125 nay , " Mather said carefully . " Am I to assume that the captain considers us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause . Then : " Sir , I ca n't say what 's in the captain 's mind about that . I 'm afraid yor I 'll have to take it up with him directly . " " I see . " Mather glanced down at Wallis and signaled for her to begin dressing , then turned back to the door Kr Ille . " Can you tell me specifically why the captain wants to see us , Mister Courtenay ? " " I 'd  --  ah  --  rather not discuss it out here in the cordr , sir . And I do n't mean to rush you , but I do have my rders . " All right , we 'll be right with you . " Breaking the link with Courtenay , Mather moved Across the room to the regular intercom and hit the switch . " ( ' omNet , this is Seton . Connect me with the duty Officer in my hold . " " Stand by , please . " I le began pulling on a pair of trousers as he waited lot . r response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chair nearby and continued with her own dressing . " Wing here . "  | hit Mather switch the securedvisual forthe waistband. circuits on his trousers and " Give me a status report , Wing . Is everything all right down there ? " Wing 's face on the tiny screen had been bland , emotionless , when it first appeared . Now the young man raised one dark eyebrow , his manner becoming more guarded . " Is there some reason to suspect that everything is n't , sir ? " " You 've had no trouble , then ? " Mather insisted . " Nothing has tripped any of the alarms , and nothing has happened that you know of ? " " I would have called you , if it had , sir . " Mather nodded and pulled on a shirt over his head , uncertain what to make of that news , and began yanking on boots . " All right , Wing , just stand by until I can get down there  --  and do n't let anyone near those cats ! I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything is all right inside . Wait until I get there . Then there can be no question of any of you being blamed . " " Yes , sir . By the way , regarding any of us bein blamed , all of us except Mister Perelli had the opportunity to place that device you found yesterday . The tapes show the spot at a bad angle , though . It 's impossible to tell whether anyone actually did plant something since we 've been in here . " Mather nodded . " Thanks , Wing . Maybe that will help to soothe the captain . We 're on our way to hi office under escort . I 'll see you as soon as we can ge away . " With a sigh , he broke off the connection an shrugged into the harness of his needler holster checking the weapon before fitting it into place . Wallis had finished dressing and was checking the contents of her medical kit . Mather , with a worried glance in her direction , picked up a gray fatigue jacket and slipped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door  | lock . Courtenay was waiting outside , four of his security men drawn up at attention behind him , weapons conspicuous on their hips . Mather made no attempt to conceal his own weapon as he adjusted his lapels . " Well , Mister Courtenay ? " " Commodore Seton , " Courtenay acknowledged with a slightly sickly grin . " I hope we 're not going to have to shoot it out with you . " " Not if I can help it . Wo n't you come in for a morrrent , Mister Courtenay ? Gentlemen , we 'll be with you shortly . " He had drawn Courtenay in almost before the man realized what was happening , and as the door closed behind him , the security chief swallowed and glanced 127 around the room uneasily . Wallis , too , was slipping a : reedier into her med kit . " I 'm really sorry about this , Commodore . I  --  ah ? Maybe you should know what 's happened , before you go charging in to see the captain . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wallis said , looking up . " Can you give us any details ? " Mather asked . Courtenay nodded uncomfortably . " I probably should n't be telling you this , Commodore , but my men will be blamed , too , because some of them were on duty outside the hold where your cats are . The first victim was one of our people  --  an engineer 's mate named Phillips , up on Deck Two . He 'd been dead a couple of hours when they found him  --  his throat ripped out like the last victim , his chest and arms badly slashed . I ' here were  --  bloody cat paw prints on the carpet around him . And a  --  a tuft of Lehr cat fur in one hand arrcl a bloodstained force-blade in the other . " " Cat blood or human , on the blade ? " Mather de nr : Tided . " I do n't know that , sir . " " I see , " Mather said quietly . " And the other victim ? "  | " One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The one called Ta'ai , Muon 's mate . Apparently she was found right after her attacker left . She  --  had just stopped breathing , but a steward and one of my men were able to keep her ventilated until a medical team could get there and take over . She 's been in surgery for nearly an hour now , but she 's really critical . Doctor Shannon 's been pulling blood from some of the other Aludrans to keep her going at all . " Wallis shook her head and sighed , then closed up her medical kit and slung it over her shoulder with a determined expression . " Mister Courtenay , I hope you do n't try to stop me , but I 'm going up to Medical Section to see if I can help 128 out . Mather can answer to the captain for both of us . " " I agree , " Mather said , resting both hands on his hips just a little defiantly . " Courtenay , are you going to try to stop her ? " Courtenay shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly not going to try to disarm you . You can explain it to the captain . " " I 'll do that , " Mather replied as they moved toward the door . " By the way , I 've already checked with my people in the hold , and Lieutenant Wing reports nothing out of the ordinary . I 've given him orders not to do anything or to admit anyone until I can get there myself , so if I were you , I would n't try any forcible entry that the captain might suggest before he has all the facts . Do you understand my meaning ? " " Yes , sir . " Courtenay opened the door . " There 's no problem , gentlemen , " he added , as his men alerted . " Commodore Seton is coming with us . Doctor Hamilton is needed in Medical Section . " Five minutes later , all of them except Wallis were standing before another door on the command level of the ship as Courtenay buzzed for admission , then thumbed the door control . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the dark polished  | nccrface reflecting his even darker mood . He said nothing as Mather came into the room , only signaling with a curt hand gesture that Courtenay should leave them alone . There were no chairs on Mather 's side of the desk , so he approached to within arm 's reach of the desk and stopped . " Where is your wife , Commodore ? " the captain said quietly . Mather gazed back mildly , letting no inkling of his knowledge show on his face . " Where a physician should be , Captain . She 's gone to assist your medical staff . We were told that there 'd been a serious medical emergency . " " Then you doubtless know what happened and have already constructed some suitably glib explana- 129 Zion , " Lutobo said . " Go ahead , Commodore . I shall be fascinated to hear how you plan to wiggle out of this one . " " I 'm afraid I ca n't oblige you , Captain , " Mather ret urned evenly . " Your Mister Courtenay was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more concrete to work with , I 'm afraid I ca n't do much to help you . We are working for the same end purpose , however . " " Are we ? " Lutobo 's eyes narrowed at that , as if trying to ascertain whether Mather was toying with f I in , then sat back in his chair . " Very well , Commodore . Here are some concrete facts . Two more people have been attacked aboard my ship , one of them fatally. ' lice deceased was one of my engineers . He had a bloody force-blade in one hand , blue fur in the other , and bloody paw prints around his body . The other victim is st ill alive , but only because of the fast thinking of two of ' my crew . She was found in roughly the same Condit ion as the other two victims , except that she was n't quite dead yet . Apparently there 's some slight chance Unit cat she might regain consciousness long enough to describe her attacker . I wonder what she 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since I 've already checked with my people in the hold , and ? " " I do n't care who you 've checked with , dammit , Seton ! " Lutobo bellowed , pounding one fist on the desk as he lurched forward in his chair . " At this point , I do n't even care whether your cats are the culprits or not . I ca n't allow this to continue . I 've lost a passenger and a member of my crew already , and we 're probably going to lose that second passenger . That 's three lives , Seton ! What am I going to tell my company ? " " Is that all you can think of ? Your company ? " Mather snapped . " Be reasonable , Captain . We 're up against something outside both our experience . I do n't understand it , you do n't understand it , and no one else understands it  --  except , perhaps , whoever is actually doing these things  --  but we 're never going to understand it if you keep jumping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just tried to tell you that I called the hold before leaving my cabin , and I was assured that everything is still secure . Your own security people confirm that no one has passed through that door . " " That is n't possible ! " Lutobo said . " There were pan ' prints this time , dammit ! Maybe they 're teleporting ? 1 do n't know . But I wo n't have it . I want you to get rid of the cats . " " You what ? " " You heard me . I want the cats destroyed . You can have Doctor Hamilton put them to sleep , or I can have my security men blast them , or we can jettison them in space  --  I do n't care how it 's done , as long as it 's done quickly . But I want them gone . I want them off my ship ! " " Lutobo , you did n't hear a word I said about the importance of those cats , did you ? " Mather replied . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care to be around to answer for the consequences . " " That can be arranged , too ! "  | " Can it , then ? " Mather said , leaning both hands on the edge of the desk to stare down at Lutobo . The movement opened his jacket so that the butt of the needier under his left arm was partially exposed . " How dare you bring a weapon into this office ? " I , utobo whispered , suddenly afraid . " Courtenay ? " But before he could push the button to call for help , Mather was leaning across to block the button , his wide hand pinning Lutobo 's smaller , darker one . " Mister Courtenay is more intelligent than to try disarming an Imperial agent , Captain . So , I would have thought , are you . " He released the hand and straightened menacingly . " I had n't thought it necessary , but perhaps I should remind you again who you 're dealing with . Wallis and I receive our orders directly from the 131 Imperial High Command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , it will take you about two hours to verify that and to confirm , for your own edification , dust how slight are the limitations on our authority . " While you 're checking on that  --  and I have no doubt that you will  --  I intend to go to the hold and inspect the Lehr cats again  --  and to remain there with t hem until we reach Tersel , if necessary , to ensure that t hey come to no harm . If I should discover that the cats are , indeed , responsible for the attacks aboard this ship , then I will personally take appropriate measures , regardless of the animals ' value . But in the meantime , I will brook no interference in the performance of my - I- i t ies , either by you or by any member of your staff . 1 lave I made myself perfectly clear ? " Lutobo , sitting stiffly upright in his chair , was almost white with suppressed rage by the time Mather had finished , but he was still sufficiently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bluff tinder such circumstances . With icy calm , he stood and leaned forward with both hands on his desk , so that there was only a meter or so of shiny leatherine bet wren them . His dark eyes shone like polished stone in  | his impassive face . " I understand you perfectly , Commodore . " His words were crisp , precise , cold with anger . " And now I want you to understand something . I intend to communicate with your superiors again , as you have suggested . And I intend to secure whatever authority it takes to ensure that your Lehr cats are destroyed and that you are broken in rank and ruined for this . You have your two hours , Commodore . But after that , we shall see whether your Imperial Command will allow you to abuse your authority to the endangerment of private citizens . The Gruening Line is not to be trifled with , Seton . Is that clear ? " " Perfectly , " Mather said . " And now , by your leave , Captain " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heels precisely ? " I 'll continue about my business . You know where to find me . " He stopped at the new murder site on the way , but there was little there that he had not seen before . The bulk of the bloodstained carpet had been cleaned by the time he got there , and maintenance personnel were replacing a section where a guard said the paw prints had been . The piece had already gone to the laboratory for further examination and preservation until forensic chemists on Tersel could run detailed tests . " Was it the victim 's blood ? " Mather asked a technician . The man shrugged . " Well , I do n't think it was cat blood , if that 's what you 're really asking , Commodore . As to whether it was the victim 's blood , I could n't say until I 've seen the lab results . " " What about the force-blade ? " " That 's gone to the lab , too . " The man cocked his head at Mather . " Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some kind of maniac loose on the ship , rather than the cats doing all of this ? " Mather only shrugged . " I 'll let you know when I 've formed an opinion . "  | Ship 's Security was still in evidence outside the door to the hold when Mather got there , and the Rangers had installed even more stringent security measures during the night . After Mather had put his palm to the ident scanner that now activated the outer door , he stepped into the door lock and felt the brief tingle of sensors scanning his body for weapons , pausing on his needler . Then , just before the inner door slid aside , he was caught briefly in a tangle field that jangled every nerve ending in his body . Closing his eyes , he ceased all movement and forced himself to relax immediately , not even breathing as the energy tendrills wound around him ; he waited while the Ranger on the other end scrutinized him and then deactivated the field . It was Webb . " Sorry for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own weapon as he approached his superior . " You 're the first to try out our new security system . I did n't hurt you , did I ? " Flexing his muscles experimentally , Mather shook his head . " No , you did fine . Next time , though , tell me when I 'm going to walk into a tangle field . " " Sorry , sir . " Mather glanced toward the area of the cats ' enclosure as Wing and three more Rangers came out of the security station toward him . Still in the little room , Peterson and Casey swiveled toward him , Peterson keeping one eye on the outside scanners . In the center of the room , everything appeared to be as he had left it the night before . Electronic baffles cut off whatever sound might have been coming from inside the cats ' cage , and the force nets around the cage area reduced the interior to a blurred , not-black glimmer that almost hurt the eyes to look at directly . Everything appeared to be all right  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see what lay beyond . " Sir , can you tell us what 's happened ? " Neville  | asked as he and the others clustered around . Mather brought his attention back to them reluctantly , unable to shake the waves of foreboding that were assailing him continually now . " There have been two more attacks during the night , gentlemen  --  one of them fatal . " " Well , it ca n't have been the cats , then , " Perelli murmured . " Aye , we were watching every indicator , every alarm , " Fredericks said . " There was nothing out of the ordinary . " Wing shifted from one foot to the other . " You said that only one attack was fatal , sir . What about the other ? " " The other victim is still alive  --  or was , when last I heard . It was one of the Aludrans  --  a female named Ta'ai . Wallis has gone to assist . " " Then maybe this Ta'ai can tell us what attacked her , " Perelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cats , sir . There 's no way they could have gotten out without us knowing . " " I know . " Mather sighed , clapping the man on the shoulder in reassurance as he moved a few steps closer to the first of the defenses around the cages . " All right , Mister Peterson , let 's see inside , shall we ? " Peterson ran his tongue across dry lips and turned back to his control console , setting recorders and backup circuits in operation and rechecking all systems one last time . " Ready when you are , sir . " " Let 's take ' em down , then . " There was the low whirr of the additional recorders and sensors cycling in , the snick of a needler safety being thumbed aside by one of the Rangers , the tension-amplified snap of the power switches being thrown . As the nets flickered out of existence , the mournful howling of three Lehr cats rose eerily in the  | hold . The fourth cat , who was the reason for their howling , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically awash with blood . " What the ? " Faster than a man his size had a right to move , Mather was beside the cage , peering in at the slaughtered Lehr cat and automatically activating the big cage scanners . The dead cat 's mate , the smaller of the two females , stood her ground , her wails turning to snarling defiance as Mather tried to look closer . The Rangers did not move , too shocked and stunned even to murmur among themselves as to how the thing could have happened .  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | gency in there , though . I think it has to do with one of those aliens . " " Really ? " " Hmmm . " The boy nodded as he drank down whatever the nurse had brought him for his headache . " Right after I got here , one of the security guards brought in one of those aliens that bundle up all the time  --  with the feathers on top of their heads . " " An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess so . He looked awfully shaky . They took him inside , and it was ten minutes or so before anybody came out to see what I needed . " The boy grimaced and rubbed at his temples . " I think I 'll try a nap , to get rid of this headache . Maybe it 'll be gone by 140 dinnertime . " " I 'm sure it will , " Wallis said politely . But when the boy had gone , and a quick glance outside revealed no one coming , Wallis went cautiously to Shannon 's office door and touched the latch plate . To her surprise , the door slid back immediately . Heartened , she slipped inside and closed it behind her , heading immediately for the master console on Shannon 's desk . The controls were clearly labeled . Running her finger down the row of monitor switches , Wallis tried surgery first  --  empty , except for an orderly cleaning up  --  then looked in briefly on one of the treatment rooms , where Shannon and an assistant were performing an autopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she punched up surgical recovery . Deller 's back blocked most of her view of the bandage-swathed patient he tended , but the erratic life readings Wallis called up on another monitor identified the patient as Aludran  --  an Aludran very close to death . A crimsonrobed Muon sat close by , his feather-crested head bowed over a bandaged hand that trailed tubes and wires , so the patient could only be the unfortunate Ta'ai.  | Sighing helplessly , Wallis shook her head and flicked quickly through the half dozen infirmary rooms , glancing only in passing at other patients sleeping or resting , a few of them attended by a tenselooking nurse or orderly . Then she stopped to look more closely as another alien crest caught her eye . It was Ta'ai 's brother , the quick , articulate Bana , sitting dejectedly on the edge of the bed where the technicians had left him after drawing his blood for Ta'ai . He was shivering , despite the thermal blanket he had pulled around himself against the cold of the ship 's normal environment , but his own discomfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed unwaveringly on the view screen a few meters across the room  --  the monitor in Ta'ai 's recovery room  --  and occasionally he swayed 141 weakly and shuddered . Once , his slender hand reached out as if to hold the motionless image on the screen before him , but the very act betrayed his knowledge of its futility . Only a miracle could save Ta'ai now , and miracles seemed to be in short supply . Wallis watched for several seconds , sensing the despair that the little alien must be feeling , then noted t he location of the room she was viewing and switched off her console . Less than a minute later , she was entering the room . Bana turned around as she came in , recognition flickering in the pained yellow eyes . " Why have you come ? Have you not done enough ? " " I 'm sorry about Ta'ai , " Wallis murmured , moving around to sit on the end of the bed near Bana . " I know t hat you hold us responsible because we brought the cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how t o say this without its sounding as if I 'm just trying to defend the cats , but Mather  --  Commodore Seton  --  and I are n't convinced that the cats are to blame . " " Not to blame ? " Bana interrupted hotly . " How can cats not be to blame ? You saw body of first passenger killed , Doctor . You see Ta'ai , dying there on screen . flow can you say cats be not to blame ? "  | Wallis exhaled heavily . " I ca n't prove it yet , Bana . But I can tell you that Commodore Seton found an electronic device near the cats , after the first man was killed . It was putting out a psychotronic  --  a mental sound ' ? that made the cats angry and afraid  --  and also everybody guarding them : the Rangers , the crewmen . And it may have been what upset Muon so much the night before . " " Electronic device ? " Bana said blankly . " Machine ? " " That 's right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shift her terminology to a vocabulary that Bana could understand . " Maybe the cats did n't scare Muon at all . Maybe the machine scared Muon , but he thought it was the cats . Maybe someone put the machine there to 142 make the cats angry and afraid and then killed the people , so it would look as if the cats killed them . " " Why someone want to do that ? " Bana asked . " Besides , we know cats kill people on ship . Ship 's officers find fur and cat tracks . Muon see death in worship trance . Now you say maybe cats not kill ? " Wallis shook her head . " I ca n't explain what Muon saw , ' Bana . I do know what was found . But the cats ca n't have been out of the hold . We 've got a lot of sophisticated equipment down there , which would have told us if they had . It does n't lie . Besides , our cats are different from the ones you know and fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . " Bana bowed his head for a moment , then looked up wearily at the screen . " And maybe it not matter what color cats are , Doctor . Ta'ai , my czina , my sister , is dying , and they  --  will not let me be with her . " His voice broke at that , and he turned his head away and would not look at her . Thoughtfully , Wallis glanced up at the screen again  --  at Ta'ai connected to her life-sustaining machines , at the solemn-faced Deller monitoring the function of those machines , at Muon hunched beside Ta'ai and holding her hand . " Why do n't you come with me , Bana ? " Wallis said ,  | standing to gently lay a hand on Bana 's blanketed shoulder . " Much as I 'd like to undo what 's happened , I ca n't  --  but I think I can get you in to be with your czina . " Minutes later , she was back in Shannon 's office and watching the surgical recovery room again . Deller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side , his very presence apparently strengthening Muon , at least ? t hough Ta'ai 's life readings grew weaker with each passing minute . Satisfied  --  for there was nothing more she could do for Bana or for Ta'ai  --  Wallis changed the scene again until she relocated Shannon . The younger physician , the autopsy completed , was stripping off soiled surgical gloves and gown while she listened to a concerned- 143 looking Deller . He spoke too low for the microphones to pick up what he said , but Shannon 's face fell at his words , and she stood silently for several seconds after he left . Then , as her assistant began gathering up the surgical instruments they had used , Shannon reached wearily above the table and removed a data cassette ? and headed for the door . Wallis heard a door sigh open and closed in the outer office , and quickly turned off the console as footsteps approached . " What are you doing here ? " Shannon asked dully as she entered and tossed the data cassette onto the console . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her short curly hair , then sank down in a chair opposite Wallis and closed her eyes , leaning her head against the chair back . " I thought I might be able to help , " Wallis said , watching the younger woman carefully . " I guess it 's been pretty bad , has n't it ? And not enough sleep to deal with it well , either , I 'll bet . We should n't have hit you with that vampire business last night . How much sleep did you get ? " Shannon shrugged but did not open her eyes . " Who knows ? Two hours ? Three ? Deller called me to surgery  | just before six . It 's nearly ten now , and already I 've been through an extensive surgery and an autopsy , on top of what happened yesterday . My work is n't half over , either . There 'll be another autopsy before the day is out . Ta'ai is n't going to make it . " " I know . I took the liberty of monitoring her while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you I made him let Bana in to be with her . I hope you do n't mind . " Shannon opened her eyes look at Wallis , then shook her head , though she made no effort to rouse from her comfortable position . " Of course not . He should have been there all along . In all the confusion , somebody obviously forgot to move him . We pulled quite a lot of blood from him when he first came in , hoping it might buy her a little more time , but the poor fellow could only give so much . She was pumping it out almost as fast as we could pump it in . " " I know . It wo n't be much longer . " Wallis sighed and leaned over the desk to punch up Ta'ai 's readings again . " Damn , look at that . She 's started to go flat already . " Shannon grimaced , then sat forward far enough to insert her data cassette and order a correlation run between this one and the previous day 's report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited for the readout . " I do n't think I 'm cut out to be a company doctor , Wallis , " she said , rubbing a hand over her eyes . " Do you know what the captain had the audacity to remind me , when we were floating Ta'ai into surgery ? That the murder of a passenger aboard a Gruening ship can do terrible things to the company 's reputation . Not a word about Ta'ai . He was worried about the company 's image . " " Well , I suppose that 's part of his job , " Wallis ventured . " He does n't strike me as a hard-hearted man . Rigid , perhaps , but ? " Shannon sighed explosively and sat forward to  | watch the readout begin crawling up the screen . " Oh , I do n't suppose I should really blame him , " she said . " Do n't let on that you know , but he 's marking time until he can retire to a planetside assignment . I le 's developed a heart condition that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued to read the data , shaking her head as she tapped the screen with a fingernail . " Wallis , look at this report . You 're going to have to face facts . Throats torn out , chests and arms slashed to ribbons , the bodies nearly drained of blood  --  and each one , Ta'ai included , had a t uft of blue cat hair in his or her fist . It 's almost as if the beasts left a calling card ! " Wallis stood up for a better angle on the screen . " Yes , almost a little too perfect , do n't you think ? " 145 Sighing wearily , Shannon shook her head . " Come on , Doctor . I know you want to believe that the cats did n't do it , but we 've been over this before . The blue I u r r is definitely Lehr cat fur . And what else could rip 1 hose bodies like that ? Phillips 's neck was snapped like a twig . " " I know what it looks like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I still want to run a comparison of the fur found on the bodies with samples from our cats . " Shannon looked at her in disbelief , then sat back ; Ind exhaled violently , chasing a stylus around the desk top with one forefinger . " When someone can get into the hold to get those samples , I 'll be happy to do that , Doctor ! And when I do , are you next going to tell me that , sure , the victims were killed by a Lehr cat , only it was n't one of your Lehr cats ? I wonder if you 'd care to speculate as to where a fifth cat could be hiding aboard the Valkyrie , or how it would have gotten here ! " " All right , I agree , it 's farfetched , " Wallis said . " When none of the logical explanations fits , though , one has to try the illogical ones . " She scanned over the next few  | lines in the report , then glanced across at Shannon again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor near Phillips 's body and that he had a bloody force-blade in his hand . Cat blood ? " " I 'm still waiting for the lab work on that , " Shannon replied sullenly . " But frankly , that 's the least of my worries just now . We 've got nearly eleven hundred passengers aboard this ship , and eight hundred crew , and every one of them is getting jumpy . The word has gotten out , and a lot of them ca n't sleep  --  or do n't want to  --  and there were a couple more witnesses who found or saw this morning 's victims before we could secure the scenes . They 're sedated now , and I 'll have to do memory wipes on them before too many more hours 146 pass , but  --  damn it , Wallis , I ca n't wipe out the memories of everyone aboard this ship ! " " I do n't envy you your job , " Wallis said lamely . " If there were something more I could do , you know I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed a wan smile . " Look , I 'm not blaming you . I guess I 'm not even really blaming your cats , for certain  --  though you have to admit that the evidence looks pretty damning . At this point , I 'm almost tired and desperate enough to even believe your vampire hypothesis , if you could produce a likely suspect . " She grinned wearily . " You see what measures I 'll stoop to , to get this situation off my back ? " " You 're exhausted . You do n't know what you 're saying , " Wallis said with a smile . Shannon almost laughed as she agreed . " I 'll say . I 'm exhausted . My staff is exhausted . Not counting Deller and me , I 've only got twenty people , and nearly half of those are orderlies . Deller was on call last night , so he 's in even worse shape than I am , but he 's got to last at least as long as Ta'ai . But the regular functions of medical service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know . "  | " That 's true . And if you do n't get some rest while you can , you 're going to need medical service . Why do n't you lie down and have a nap ? I 'll cover for you while you sleep . " " Thanks , but I ca n't let you do that , " Shannon said with a yawn , weaving to her feet to lean against the desk . " It 's my responsibility . I 've got to wait for that blood workup , and then someone will have to ? " " Someone else can handle things for a few hours , " Wallis insisted , pulling the younger woman out from behind the desk and closer to the couch along the wall . " Sit down . I 'm indirectly responsible for your situation . The least you can do is let me help . " " Wallis , I ca n't  --  really , " Shannon protested weakly . " Oh , yes , you can . " Wallis passed one hand close in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers . " Relax and let go , Shivaun . Look at my hand and let your mind go blank for a little while . Watch the end of my finger . As it comes closer to your forehead , your eyelids are getting heavier and heavier  --  and when it touches , you will go to sleep . " And as her finger touched Shannon between the eyes , her other hand moved from its supportive position on the younger woman 's shoulder to a spot just between the shoulder blades , which she pressed . The combination of suggestion , fatigue , and a pressure point that Wallis had learned years before from a monk of Tel Taurig was more than Shannon could resist . As she started to slump , relaxing in sleep , Wallis eased her back to lie down on the couch and pulled a thermal blanket loosely around her . Then she went to the desk console and tapped out a request for information , keying with the access code she had seen Shannon use . Almost immediately , the readout began clicking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of victim Phillips : homo sapiens , type B-positive . Fur- ther breakdown of variants still in progress , due to small quantity of sample . Blood specimen taken from victim Phillips : homo sapiens , type 0 - positive , accounting for all samples thus far analyzed from paw prints and other blood seepage at scene . Further analysis and comparisons progressing . " And no mention of cat blood , " Wallis muttered to herself , straightening from the console to glance briefly at the sleeping Shannon . So . That knowledge alone was a gem of great worth , for it meant that Phillips 's attacker almost certainly had not been one of the cats  --  not with type B-positive blood on the blade . Nor was it Phillips 's own blood . And homo sapiens blood of whatever type excluded the alien Aludrans from the reckoning  --  though Wallis had never suspected them of such physical violence , anyway . Which meant that Phillips 's attacker almost certainly was a human with type B-positive blood  --  which , since close to ten percent of a given human population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , narrowed any potential list of suspects to only around two hundred of the Valkyrie 's nearly two thousand passengers and crew . Unless the computer could refine its parameters further , which seemed less and less likely as a readout was not forthcoming , that was still a lot of suspects , even putting the crew right at the bottom of the list . Impatient , Wallis asked for a status check , only to confirm that the computer was having difficulty reading more than a very gross profile of the B-positive blood sample . The scant quantity of the specimen from the blade seemed to be part of the problem , but some other factor was also at work  --  almost as if the secondary blood characteristics were being screened by some unusual chemical bonding . She decided not to wait in Shannon 's office any  | longer , though . After directing the computer to kick out separate lists of passengers and crew who fit the suspect profile  --  however gross that might turn out to be , given the incomplete profile it had to match against medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security office as well as in Shannon 's , Wallis left a progress report for Shannon to find when she awoke , and left for the hold . She wondered how her new information would fit with what Mather had found . Other than his initial discovery of the butchered Cat , however , Mather had learned very little . After partit Toning off that end of the cage  --  which enraged the remaining cats and set off a new chorus of screaming ? Mather set the big cage scanners to record the most obvious trauma to the dead cat 's body . But he suspected that Wallis would need to do a proper post mortem to learn any real details of what had happened . So he concentrated on how it had happened , questioning his Rangers and running yet another check of all their security equipment while he waited for Wallis to show up . But he turned up no discrepancies . The tapes showed no break in service , from the time the phase nets were set the night before , until Mather himself had ordered them shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be functioning perfectly , with no reason to suspect that it had not always done so . And independent interviews of all his men by himself and Perelli , his interrogation expert , failed to disclose any variance in individual reports of the night 's events . By all outward evidence , nothing unusual had ocetirred in the security hold . Except that the Lehr cat they called Rudolph lay slaughtered in a pool of his own blood at the end of a plasteel cage , his companions ' voices lifted in mournful howls as the humans who had brought them there tried to discover the cause of his death .  | Thus it was that Wallis found her husband crouching in front of the dead cat 's cage and running tests with a portable scanner balanced on one knee . She glanced at his readings as she laid both hands on his shoulders and leaned down to kiss the top of his head . " What do you want to bet that at least some of the blood in that cage is humanoid , type B-positive ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his perplexed study of the dials on his scanner . " That 's right  --  though some of it is A-positive . Most of it is cat blood , of course . " He blinked again , then turned enough to actually look up at her . " You do n't even seem surprised . And how did you know that there would be B-positive ? " " There was B-positive blood on the dead engineer 's force blade  --  and no cat blood anywhere . I wish you had n't found A-positive , though . It means we must have two suspects instead of one . The engineer was type O. " Wonderful , " Mather muttered . " Now nothing connects . " " Yes , it does  --  it has to . We just do n't have the connections figured out yet , " Wallis said , kneeling down beside him . " Do you want me to take over here for a while ? You look as if you could use a few minutes to unwind and try for a fresh approach . " With a grunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood up stiffly to stretch . " It just does n't make any sense , " he said . " I know there has to be some rational explanation , but damned if I can find it . About the only thing I know for certain right now is that old Rudolph did n't commit suicide . Nor did his mate rip him to shreds . " The mate in question , the cantankerous Matilda . let out a particularly grating screech , as if to underline his statement . But merely pacing and looking at the remaining cats from other visual angles did not bring the inspira- Lion Mather hoped for . In a very short time , he found himself standing silently in front of the slain Rudolph 's cage again . Wallis had opened the end of the cage to examine the body more closely and collect more blood samples , and the other cats had finally stopped their howling , except for an occasional mournful cry from Matilda . " Anything new ? " Mather said quietly . Wallis half turned in his direction . " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you find any discrepancies among t he men ? " Chilled , Mather crouched down beside her . " No . Why ? Do you think it was an inside job ? " " I hope not , " Wallis replied , " but if our security arrangements are as good as we 've been saying all 151 along , we certainly have to consider that possibility . I can tell you that old Rudolph here did n't die of his wounds , however . " She held out a tiny needier dart , its tufted drug receptacle clear and empty . " It 's the same manufacturer we use , Mather  --  which is not to say that someone else could n't have bought from the same source . This is the only one I found , but from the level of tranquilizer in his bloodstream , I 'd say he took five or six of these before his killer settled down to cut him up . Somebody did n't want to take any chances . His breathing would have been paralyzed very quickly , and he must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The poor critter did n't have a chance . " " Well , at least he got in a few swipes at his killer or killers , " Wallis said . " You were absolutely right about t Ise blood , too . There are traces of B- and A-positive blood on his claws and in the cage  --  which tends to confirm that our prime suspect is probably the same x  --  rson who tangled with Phillips 's knife . We should have a printout of B-positive suspects any time . " Sighing , Mather glanced at the three remaining cats , who had massed just on the other side of the  | separating partition and were watching him intently . " I sure wish you guys could talk , " he said softly , a little surprised to see them so quiet . " Or  --  can you ? " he added , after a beat . " Wally , I 've just gotten an idea . Do you suppose you could get everybody out of here for a few minutes ? I 'll want the force nets back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Shannon , just in case we have more trouble with this than I think we 're going to have . This is a long shot , but I think it 's worth a try , under the circumstances . " Wallis considered it more than a long shot , but she was not about to argue . After dispatching Pirelli as requested , she had Webb round up the remaining Rangers in the security room and cut in the shields . The not-black shimmer of the Margall force field made everything beyond it blur disconcertingly , and she blinked and shook her head to clear her vision as she turned back to the cages . Mather had already lured an oddly docile Matilda into the section of the cage nearest her dead mate and shut her off from the other pair , who seemed not to mind . Wallis turned on the cage scanner overhead , then began rummaging in her medical kit for a hypospray as Mather calmly drew his needler and shot Matilda . As the dart struck , the big cat spat and hissed , licked furiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cage and peered out at them with wide , startled eyes . " Give her a minute or two , " Wallis said , glancing at the scanner readouts and handing a loaded hypospray to Mather . " This should n't hurt her , but it 's one thing you do n't want to rush . " Holstering his weapon , Mather sat down heavily on the floor beside the cage , watching as Matilda 's big , night-seeing pupils contracted to merest slits and the animal 's legs collapsed , letting her down with a whoof . Cautiously , Mather reached the hypospray toward the cat 's nearer forepaw , where the fur was shorter and  | thinner , and triggered it . Matilda hissed back at it , but her head was already weaving as it sank slowly to rest on the wide , hairy paws . As Wallis scanned the cat again , Mather reset the hypo and unsnapped the cuff of his left sleeve . " You 're sure you want to go through with this ? " Wallis asked , turning the scanner on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could set it to his wrist . " I 'm sure I want to find out what happened , " Mather countered with a wry little smile . " Our fuzzy friend , here , saw everything . " Briefly , he reached over to stroke the blue fur E ) ooching through the mesh of the cage , then glanced at the setting of the hypo one more time before triggering it against his inner wrist . He winced at the cold t hat immediately began spreading up his arm from the injection site , but he managed a ghost of a smile as he handed the hypo back to Wallis . " Do n't worry . You know the drug is n't going to hurt cite in such a low dose ; and if I start to get into trouble otherwise , I promise to come right back . " " Sure , " Wallis murmured , readying another hypo , just in case , " as long as you know you 're risking your life to save a cat . " But Mather had ceased to pay attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the cage , his shoulders resting against the mesh and the soft blue fur , he stretched out his right arm toward Matilda 's head , hooking two fingers through the mesh to burrow in the fur of one great forepaw . His eyelids fluttered and then closed as he laid his head back against the mesh of the cage . By the time Wallis had scanned him again , verifying a steady pulse with her hand on his free left wrist , Mather was no longer aware of what was going on around him . He sensed only the odd play of light and shadow against his closed eyelids as the Margall field  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | like a cloud hissed at her from one man-shape 's paw and the other one shot her mate with one of the stinging things she remembered from her capture . He bit at the dart and tried to tear it from his fur , but the drug worked quickly  --  and something was draining her strength as well . She could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mate staggering , weaving drunkenly , then collapsing as more darts struck his side , and she tried to call to him . He was panting now , lying flat on his side , his tufted tail lashing more and more weakly , and her hunting mates were sprawling helplessly in the cage behind her . Then one of the man-shapes was emerging from the cloud and circling the end of the cage nearest her mate , opening the mesh , and raising something that shone in the odd light . She tried to force her heavy body to respond , to drag herself upright and rend the hated enemy limb from limb , but she was as weak and helpless as a new cub . She saw the flash of metal , then the bright fountain of blood , as the man-shape savaged her mate  --  who fought bravely , for as long as he could . But soon she could lift her own head no longer and felt her own awareness draining away , her vision going dim , as the drug continued to work . When next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congealing pool of his own blood , not even breathing , his soft fur matted and streaked with red . She had nosed at him desperately , raking her tongue across his face in a futile attempt to rouse him , but he was as still as the fleetbeasts they had used to hunt together . Her howl of anguish had soon been joined by those of her hunting mates , as they sang their grief to an unhearing and uncaring universe . Mather shuddered at the poignancy of that raw emotion , staying with it a few seconds longer to let the full impact sink into his mind , then withdrew , opening his eyes carefully to turn and gaze at the creature  | ose memory he had just shared . The big cat slept ore easily now , as if sharing the horror had somehow ought a measure of comfort to her simple mind . rhaps she had sensed Mather 's outrage as well . ftly Mather stroked the giant paw where it lay beeath his fingers , finally turning to glance at Wallis . is wife was sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips . " Some of it spilled over , did n't it ? " Mather murured , letting his head lie back against the cage once ore . " Did you see what happened ? " " Not really . But think I felt a little of her loss , " Wallis swered softly . " They mate for life , do n't they ? " With a drowsy smile , Mather held out his hand to er and pressed her palm to his lips , retaining her 159 d in his as he leaned back once more . " Unfortunately , this confirms that our intrepid ller definitely was not working alone , " he said , his es not yet focusing as he coaxed his recall to more nscious levels . " Matilda saw two man-things , and ne of them had a knife . Whoever they were , one of em gassed the cats and then the other one needled er mate and cut him up while he was dying . It 's pretty bvious now that someone is trying very hard to frame e cats  --  why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell us how they managed to do it , ough , " Wallis said . " If they gassed the cats , they probably gassed the Rangers , too . Hey , easy ! " she added , rummaging in her medkit for a stimcap as Mather started to get shakily to his feet . " Here , break this under your nose and breathe deeply . You 're not quite out from under the hypo yet . " " Yeah , I know . " Bracing himself against the side of the cage , Mather snapped the plastic capsule between his thumb and fingers and cupped his hand over his nose . The brief whiff of vapor was pungent , but it cleared his head . Nodding his thanks as he finished standing up , he  | handed the empty back to Wallis . " Thanks , that 's better . Now , where were we ? You 're saying they gassed the Rangers ? Would n't someone remember ? " Wallis shook her head . " Not necessarily . I 'll have to run some tests to determine exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Properly administered , the men would never even know they 'd been out . " " Well , that 's just dandy , " Mather muttered under his breath . " Who would know how to do that ? I do n't . " " No , but I do . And unfortunately , it 's quite possible that any of our Rangers might . It is n't difficult just rather specialized . " " So you 're saying that it really could have been an inside job ? " " It could have been . The killer 's accomplice could have been one of our men , at least . But it 's equally possible that the gas could have been introduced from outside the hold . I 'd rather not get bogged down in suspicion of our own people right now  --  especially since more than half of them , including ourselves have A-positive blood . " Mather shook his head and sighed again , glancing at the bright-black shimmer of the shields still around them . " Would the gas show up in blood samples , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screening clear our men , if they all had it in their systems ? " Wallis shook her head . " It would probably show up , but unfortunately our culprit probably would 've been smart enough to gas himself , too , after he 'd reset all the security systems . You 're asking all the questions I 've already asked myself , Mather . " She threw the inside switch to lower the shields . " I only wish I had some answers for you . " With the shields gone , a red light could be seen flashing insistently above the lock system in front of the outer door . Four Rangers waited there with stunners at the ready .  | " Incidentally , " Wallis added , " the captain arrived just after you went under , and he 's madder than a Sirian swamp stalker . Do you want to let him in ? " Mather snorted . " Not particularly , though I suppose I 'm going to have to . If I do n't , he 's likely to burn the door off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " Wallis grinned . " At least a dozen things , I 'm sure , but no one knows them yet to tell you . While you talk to him , I 'll be in the office , checking on those printouts . Shall I have them reactivate the shields , so he does n't hit the cats if he comes in shooting ? " " You can be so encouraging , " Mather muttered , moving closer to the lock . But he signaled Webb to reengage the shields before giving Casey the sign to admit Lutobo . " Now , see here , Seton ? " The captain was the first one through the door , a needler strapped conspicuously to his right hip , his dark face a mask of smouldering resentment . Four armed security guards followed him , but they kept their hands carefully away from their own weapons when they saw the Rangers ' stunners . Last came Perelli and Shannon , the latter more than a little cowed by the captain 's black mood . Mather decided immediately that the best defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I want some answers , and I want them now ! " Lutobo began . " Yes , Captain , I 'm sure you do , " Mather interjected smoothly . " But before I give you any , I 'd like to know about your communication with the Imperial authority ies . I trust that our respective positions and authorit ies have been defined to your satisfaction ? " Lutobo 's expression hardened at that , but he broke off what he had been about to say and took a deep breath , visibly forcing his temper back in check . " Commodore Seton , if you were the emperor 's own cousin , it would still be my responsibility to safeguard  | the lives of the passengers and crew entrusted to me. 1 you can not allow me to take what I feel are the appro. priate preventive measures to ensure their safety , an you refuse to offer reasonable alternatives , then you almost force me to go against direct orders from youtr ' superiors . " " As long as we 're permitted to continue our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wo n't interfere with any reasonable measures that you may wish to take , Captain , " Mather said calmly . " Investigation ? You 'd think there was some ques ? tion as to what 's been going on here ! " Lutobo bellowed . " And just what has been going on here , Captain ? " Mather countered . " Because if you know , I wish you 'd tell me ! " " Well  --  for God 's sake , Seton , three people have died ! " " Three ? " Wallis said , coming out of the security office to join them . " Then , Ta'ai ? " " She died half an hour ago , " Shannon replied , speaking for the first time . " There was nothing else we could do for her . " " You see ? " Lutobo said accusingly . " Three deaths . Seton . Where does it all end ? " " Not before we stop blaming the cats and start considering other alternatives , Captain , " Mather said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end that there 's been a massive frame-up shaping under our noses . Would you like to have a look at the body of the cat that was killed ? " He signaled Webb to deactivate the security net again , but Lutobo barely glanced at the cages that became visible . " At least poor Phillips got in a few good blows before the cat mangled him , " the captain muttered . " I understand that there was blood all over his force-blade . " Mather shook his head . " Phillips may have gotten in some good blows at his assailant , Captain , but that  | assailant was not a Lehr cat . The blood was humanoid , type B-positive . " " What ? " " There was n't any cat blood anywhere in the area , either , " Mather went on . " The tuft of cat fur in his other hand was the only link to our cats  --  and anyone could have put it there . " " What about the paw prints ? " " I ca n't explain those yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a few drops of the same blood as on the blade  --  type B-positive . " " But  --  if someone besides a cat killed Phillips , how do you account for your butchered cat ? " Lutobo asked , astounded . " Will you let me finish , Captain ? I said that there was n't any cat blood in Phillips 's vicinity . Furthermore , the blood we found on and around the dead cat here , other than its own , was humanoid blood . For the most part , it was the same type as on the force-blade . " Lutobo 's jaw dropped a fraction , but he managed to cover most of his astonishment well . " You mean that someone killed Phillips to make it look as if a cat did it and then came down and killed the cat , too ? " " It 's beginning to look that way , " Mather agreed . " Someone with type B-positive blood , which is reasonably rare . " " Well , do you know whose it is ? " Mather shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can tell you several people whose blood it is n't . It is n't Phillips 's , and it is n't Ta'ai 's or any other alien 's . " " Then who  --  and how  --  and why ? " Mather shook his head again . " We only know a little of the ' how , ' so far . As nearly as we can gather , whoever killed Phillips  --  getting himself wounded in the process  --  knew he would have to cover if it was going to continue to appear that the cats were responsible for the murders . I ca n't even speculate as to why he 's doing this yet , or especially why he 's doing it the way he is  | but that 's another facet of the story . At any rate , he came here to the hold , managed to get past my Rangers and tamper with the recording devices  --  we think he gassed them , but we have n't figured out exactly how he did that , either ; we 're working on it  --  and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fatally . " Lutobo , glancing past Mather at the bloody carcass , frowned . " I thought the cat was knifed . " " He was , but only after he was already dying from too many needler darts . Our fearless murderer climbed into the cage with the dying Lehr cat and started to butcher him , trying to make it look exactly as you thought it happened . Only he moved in too quickly . and the cat was n't as helpless as it appeared . That 's how humanoid blood got on the cat 's claws and in the cage . In fact , there are two different humanoid blood groups unaccounted for , so our murderer must have had help . " " Two people involved , " Lutobo breathed . " That 's incredible . But who ? " " That should n't be too difficult to find out , " Wallis replied . Our murderer and his accomplice , whoever they are , will have a few claw marks to show for their trouble . In fact , Mister B-Positive will also have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hide . Doctor Shannon , you have n't had anyone come into Medical Section to be treated for lacerations or force-blade wounds today , have you ? " " Not that I know of , " Shannon replied . " In light of what 's been happening , I 'm certain my staff would have notified me . I do have the list you requested of all passengers and crew with type B-positive blood , however . Assuming that it was n't one of the crew or a child  --  and we do know that it 's a male  --  that gives us about forty names . " She produced a printed list from inside her tunic and handed it to Wallis before going on . " I also discovered something odd when I tried to narrow down the  | list further . I wondered why I could n't get past the very basic blood profile for a more precise match . He 's taking some kind of drug that blocks the more subtle blood factors . " " You do n't know what , specifically ? " Wallis asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our list is on record as taking anything that could do that , either . I correlated everyone 's medical records on the entire ship . " " Well , what does that mean ? " Lutobo asked . " It means , " said Wallis , comparing her list with Shannon 's , " that one of the people on this list will have such a substance in his bloodstream now  --  so in a worst-case scenario , we can simply draw blood from all of them until we find our probable murderer . " 165 " The probable murderer ? " the captain muttered . " Would n't that be conclusive proof ? " " No , because more than one person could have taken such a drug . What would be conclusive proof is that our man also has at least one force-blade wound and probably several cat lacerations . He 's likely to move a little carefully ; the wounds may even be infected , Lehr cat claws being what they are . Our type A-positive accomplice is also likely to have a cat scratch or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he probably did n't get scratched as badly , judging by the amount of A-positive blood we found . " The captain 's face had gone stony with suspicion as Wallis spoke , and now he glanced from her to Mather to Shannon and then back to Mather ; he scowled as one of the Rangers brought Wallis another computer printout . " Seton , if this is some kind of clever cover-up or stall tactic ? " " And just what am I supposed to be covering up or stalling for , Captain ? " Mather demanded , setting his lists on his hips . " Granted , the cats are very important to us . You checked with our superiors , and you know the scope of our authority , so you can imagine the  | value the Imperial government sets on the cats . But if you think , even for a minute , that I would deliberately jeopardize the lives of innocent people aboard this vessel , just to complete my mission successfully , then you are very much mistaken . " " Well  --  how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , a little taken aback at the newest turn of events . Wallis , who had been scanning the second list with Shannon , raised an eyebrow as she glanced up at him . " As a matter of fact , Captain , Doctor Shannon and I talked with a man on each of these lists , only yesterday . They both have some knowledge of Lehr cats  --  and , therefore , a conceivable connection with what 's been 166 going on . Not that this necessarily makes them any more likely suspects than anyone else on the lists , but they 're a good starting point . " " Who are they ? " " Vander Torrell , the historian who sat at your table the other night , " Wallis said , " and a man called Reynal . He helped us track the cats on B-Gem . " " Who would have thought Torrell has good old A-positive blood ? " Shannon murmured . " I thought it would be blue , to hear him talk . I guess we do have something in common , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Then you 're on the list , too , Doctor . " " And so am I , and so is Mather , " Wallis interjected , " along with a good third of the human population . However , it does leave Torrell right near the top of the list  --  though I 'd guess that our B-positive suspect is the more dangerous of the two . I think I 'd like to have blood samples from both Reynal and Torrell , for starters , to check for that odd drug  --  and see if either of them has any wounds he ca n't account for . It we come up cold , we 'll start working our way down the rest of the lists . " " Well , I can have Doctor Shannon call them in to be  | checked , if that 's all it 's going to take , " Lutobo said . " True , " Wallis agreed , " but I 'd rather do it myself , if you do n't mind . I 've had more training in this sort of thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well . That way , if one one of these men is our murderer , we can deal with him . You 're welcome to come along , though , Captain . " Lutobo still looked doubtful , but finally he snorted under his breath and folded his arms resolutely . " Very well , we 'll try it your way for now , Doctor . Not that I 'm totally convinced , you understand . " He pointed at Mather . " I still do n't trust those cats of yours  --  and I want to leave some of my own security here , inside this hold , while I go with Doctor Hamilton . " Mather spread his hands in a conciliatory gesture . 167 " As long as they 're outside the shields , as my men also will be , I consider that most equitable , Captain . In fact , 1 ' 11 join you as soon as I 've made a few final adjustments . " " Suit yourself , " the captain muttered . " Mind you , though , if the cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Captain ? " With a perplexed sigh , Mather glanced at Wallis and Shannon , at the cats , back at Lutobo , then briskly drew his needler and strode back to the cat cages , holding the weapon close along his thigh . The female whose mate had been slain was still asleep ; the other pair sat quite still and looked at him suspiciously as he approached , the male occasionally letting out a low , warning growl . Mather studied the pair for several seconds , recalling the price the animals had extracted even before the Valkyrie  --  the bearers injured and maimed during the capture , the two Rangers killed on B-Gem . Then he glanced down wistfully at the weapon in his hand and raised it , carefully squeezing off a needle into each animal 's side . The cats looked startled ; the female  | started to bite at the spot where the dart had struck ) and then both of them staggered and collapsed to the floor of their cage . Behind him , Mather heard someon let out a low sigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the scanners above the two groggy cats . lie could hear the others approaching behind him as he watched the readings stabilize and the cats slipped into labored sleep . The touch on his arm was Wallis 's he turned to face the captain . " Would you say that the cats are now incapable o voluntary action , Captain ? " Mather asked . Lutobo 's dark eyes flicked over the cats briefly , then returned to Mather 's face . " You 're really certain they 're innocent , are n't you ? " he said gruffly . " So certain , you 'd endanger them to make sure they ca n't be implicated any further . " " In the final analysis , we 're talking about human lives , are n't we , Captain ? " Lutobo looked around uncomfortably  --  at Shannon and Wallis standing by , Wallis with hard copies of the blood lists in her hands ; at Mather and his Rangers ; at his own security men  --  then clasped his hands behind his back and rocked up and down a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . Doctor Hamilton , I 'd appreciate it if you 'd allow me at least the semblance of command in this operation , but otherwise , I shall bow to your expertise , both medical and otherwise . And I 'll insist that you get the cooperation you need . Doctor Shannon , I think it best if you return to Medical Section for now . We still have a shipful of passengers to care for . " " Yes , Captain . " " Courtenay , I 'll ask you to come with us , please , " he said to his security chief . " Ay , sir . " " Take Wing and Casey for your Rangers , " Mather said to Wallis , reasoning that if a Ranger was their  | second suspect and was one of the two he had chosen , at least the other might be able to neutralize him if he tried anything . " I 'll join you at Reynal 's cabin as soon as I 've finished here . Do n't take any foolish chances . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not laughing by the time she and her party reached the crew lift . And when the lift stopped at Level Four , one deck short of where Reynal 's cabin lay , the reaction of the couple waiting to board reminded her how formidable a band they must appear : she and her Rangers , Lutobo , and Courtenay . The couple decided not to board  --  she could hardly blame them  --  but just as the doors began to close , Wallis lurched toward the control panel and hit the door 169 button , worming her way between the doors as soon as t hey had opened far enough . " I saw Torrell , " she murmured over her shoulder as she leaned out to peer to the right , then pointed toward a tall , retreating figure . " There he is . Let 's take him right now , since he 's here . " With a glance at the captain , who nodded , Casey and then Courtenay and Wing hurried after . Torrell looked surprised and a little annoyed as they , Wallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something wrong , Captain ? " he asked . His manner was coldly appraising as he glanced among them . " I hope not , Mister Torrell . " " It 's Doctor Torrell ? " " Very well , Doctor Torrell , " Lutobo said . " There 's a steward 's station just a few meters down the corridor , where we can have some privacy . I 'd like you please to step inside with us to answer a few questions . " Torrell started to object , but he suddenly realized t hat he was now flanked by Courtenay and both Rangers , and that other nearby passengers were watching with increasing curiosity . No one laid a hand on him , but the implied threat was no less real for that . With a  | curt " Very well , " Torrell moved with them without re sistance to the door of the steward 's station . Lutobo. on checking the room and finding it empty , stood aside and motioned for the others to enter . As soon as the door had closed behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't suppose you 'd mind telling me what this is all about , Captain ? " " We 're conducting an investigation , Doctor Torrell . Would you please remove your jacket and your shirt ? " " My what ? " As he realized that Lutobo was serious , Torrell went into a tirade . " I 'll do no such thing ! What is this . anyway ? Star chamber proceedings ? I warn you , Doctor Hamilton ? " he barked , even more agitated when he saw that Wallis was removing an instrument from her medical kit . " If you think you can drug me and get away with it , you 're dead wrong . You have no right ? " " As captain of this ship , I have all the right I need . Torrell , " the captain said calmly , " and you wo n't be drugged unless that 's what it takes for Doctor Hamil ton to get a sample of your blood . Now , are you going to make this easy or difficult ? " Torrell looked as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but before he could open his mouth to tell them , Casey cleared his throat and snapped from parade rest to attention , slightly behind and to Torrell 's right . The sound and movement froze Torrell in his place . He turned and looked hard at the impassive Casey , pivoted to glance at Wing and Court enay , now flanking him , then turned back to Lutobo uncertain and definitely subdued . " Captain , there had better be a very good reason for this , " he said uneasily , unfastening his jacket and shirt and starting to remove both at once . Before he could get free of either sleeve , Casey and Wing caught him deftly by his shirt- and jacket-tangled arms and held him long enough for Wallis to take her  | sample . Torrell went a little pale as she drew the blood , but he sensed it was best not to struggle or protest too much with a needle in his arm . His bravado returned when they released him , however , even his color coming back as he wriggled out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestling with his shirt . Wallis , as she stored the sample in her medical kit , decided t hat Torrell probably was not their killer  --  but in case he was , she had a strong knockout hypo waiting for him  --  for in these close quarters , there might not be time for needlers . " I hope you 're enjoying this , Doctor , " Torrell said sarcastically , finally freeing one wrist from his shirt and shifting his attention to the other . " Usually , when I undress in front of a women , there 's no other audience . 171 Or maybe it 's the captain who 's enjoying it ! " He pulled off the shirt the rest of the way and flung it at Lutobo , then stood defiantly , hands on his hips , glaring . " Are you satisfied , Captain ? I 'm going to hold you personally responsible for this outrage . You wo n't get away with it , you know . " Calmly , Lutobo handed the clothing to Courtenay to hold . " Neither threats nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lutobo said . " Just do as you 're told and turn around , please . " " Of course , Captain . Anything you say , Captain , sir ! " Torrell turned around several times , making assorted mocking poses and postures as he did . Wallis looked closely at his arms and chest as he turned , but aside from a few obviously old and very minor scars ? and several sets of parallel welts on his back , from a far more human kind of cat than those residing in the hold  --  there was no sign of a wound anywhere on his body . " He seems to be clean , Captain , " Wallis murmured , closing her kit on the hypo . " I do n't think we need to see any more . " With a nod , Lutobo sighed for Courtenay to return  | Torrell 's clothing . The historian glanced at the cap ( ; in i with something akin to loathing as he thrust his arms back into his shirt . " What , no total skin search , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the shirt into place and straightening the cuffs . " I 'll have your job for this . Just watch me ! I plan to take legal action as soon as we reach Tersel . You can bet your pension on it . I do n't suppose you 'd like to tell me now what you were looking for , to excuse this outrageous treatment ? " Lutobo remained impassive . " I apoligize for any inconvenience or embarrassment you may have suffered , Doctor Torrell . We have reason to believe that someone of your blood type was wounded by one of the Lehr cats early this morning , while trying to kill it . If my manner seemed somewhat precipitous , it 's because three people have been murdered aboard this ship in the last thirty-six hours . " " And you thought that I might have committed those murders ? " " We thought you might be an accomplice , " Wallis said . " You have the right blood type . " Torrell snatched his jacket from Courtenay and jammed it under his arm in a wad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in court , Doctor ! And you , too , Captain ! All of you ! " As he stalked down the corridor , Wallis sighed and glanced wistfully at Lutobo . " You know , you could have asked me to take him out , Captain , " she said . " I had a hypo all ready . Then we could have sent him on to Shannon for a nice mind-wipe . I wo n't say it 's strictly legal , but Mather and I would have backed you all the way . " Lutobo snorted , almost smiling . " You 're going to back me anyway , Doctor . Did n't you know ? Any legal repercussions that may arise from this investigation will fall on the two of you . All that Imperial clout ought to be good for something besides  | bullying a starliner captain . " " It is , " Wallis said , controlling her own smile . " Believe me , it is . " Meanwhile , on the deck just below , one of their killers stalked his next victim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lurked in the shadows near the entrance to the Fourth Level Gymnasium , watching until just the right quarry should come along . He was weakened from his interrupted attack on Phillips ; further debilitated from the wounds sustained in the slaughter of the Lehr cat . But it was not long before his ideal victims emerged : two young boys , laughing and talking and paying scant attention to where they were going and who or what came near them . They were not on guard . They were children , the older no more than nine standard years of age , neither of them schooled in reading the subtle signs of being prey . They did not notice the figure coming at them from a side passageway until it was too late . It was almost too late when their attacker swooped out in front of them in a swirl of blue fur , golden eyes glowing with fanatic purpose in the shadow-folds of a hooded cloak . It was too late when hands reached out to seize both boys  --  the younger by the wrist , the older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement , dulling perception , numbing will . It was far too late as their captor drew the older victim closer in fatal embrace , murmuring alien words in a harsh , discordant tongue before sinking pointed teeth into a helpless , upturned throat . Nor could the younger boy even try to escape  --  for all volition , all ability to react , had been obliterated by the merest touch of that hand that held him captive . Still quivering in that grasp , the younger boy could only watch his companion pale and die , not even able to flinch as their attacker dropped his lifeless first victim to the carpet and turned to draw the second into  | that same deadly embrace . And only a few corridors away , Doctor Shivaun Shannon paused near the elevator to calm a trio of agitated passengers . The man was white-faced with tension , the two women babbling almost incoherently that they all surely would be murdered in their beds before the ship made her next port . Shannon listened politely , dispensed reassurance and a tranquilizer capsule to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman 's shrill scaream shattered the air . " What was that ? " one of the passengers asked with a gasp . Shannon bolted for the source of the cry with only a 174 muttered " Pardon me ! " but a steward and a security guard reached the scene before she did . The guard even caught a glimpse of the presumed murderer fleeing around a far turn in the companionway . While the steward called for an emergency team and tried to give aid to the young victims and a hysterical woman who apparently had raised the alarm , the guard sprinted off in pursuit , only to skid to a confused halt as he nearly ran into a hulking figure in a dark cloak . The figure reached out for him , though , and its touch paralyzed the guard , bringing him to his knees , head bowed to touch the figure 's boots . Through his pain , the guard was dimly aware of the figure bending over him , but he could not summon the will or the strength to raise his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you understand ? " whispered a voice at his left ear . " I  --  I ? " the guard managed to stammer . He could feel the speaker breathing close to his neck and caught the stench of blood on the other 's breath . " You will remember none of this , " the whisper continued . " You tripped and fell , and that which you were pursuing eluded you . You remember nothing of what you saw . "  | Something cold touched the side of the guard 's neck then , lingering briefly over the pulse point , and then fire radiated sharply outward from that point , quickly filling his head with such agony that he lost consciousness . When he came to , footsteps were pounding down the corridor around him and someone was pausing to ask if he was all right . He picked himself up dazedly , wondering what he could have tripped over to nearly knock himself out , and headed back toward the source of all the confusion in the vicinity . Shannon and a steward were bending over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard arrived . A whey-faced male passenger had covered the still body of a slightly older child with his jacket , and another tried to comfort the weeping woman who had found them . Two more from security came and tried to begin clearing the area of morbidly fascinated passengers . Deller arrived with a med tech and an emergency kit , briefly glanced at the still body under the jacket , then signaled the tech to begin seeing to the other passengers . He crouched beside Shannon and began running a scanner over the hysterical child in her arms . " Miraculously enough , I think he 's just shaken up , " Shannon murmured , trying to rummage one-handed in the medkit while she continued to hold the child against her and rock him soothingly . " Let 's give half a cc. of Suainol , all right ? There , now , hon , you 're going to be just fine . You 're safe now . No one is going to hurt you . Just relax , sweetheart . It 's all over now . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gradually , under Shannon 's ministrations and the gentle compulsion of the tranquilizer , his sobbing diminished and words began to become distinguishable . " The b-b-boolim b-b-bit Laije ! " the boy stammered , shuddering as the fright overcame him again . " I saw it !  | It bit Laije on the neck and m-made him bleed , and there was n't anything I could do ! " ' The boolim ? " Shannon asked . " A boolim ! A boolim ! " the child shrieked . " It hurt Laije ! It made him bleed , and then he would n't move ! " The last word was choked off by a hiccup and a bou t of coughing , and Shannon exchanged a troubled glance with Deller as she rocked the child closer . " What 's a boolim ? " Deller whispered . Shrugging , Shannon turned her attention back to the child . " There , now , honey , it 's not going to get you . Do n't worry . Think back before the boolim . Forget about the boolim for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going ? " 176 " L-Laije and I w-were playing f-f-floatball in the gym , " the boy said , his sobs subsiding a little as the drug became more insistent . " When we came out , we ? we were just walking along  --  and all of a sudden th-the boolim grabbed us , and I could n't get away , and neither could Laije . It had Laije by the neck . And then it came and  --  and ? " " What did the boolim look like ? " Shannon asked , glancing aside momentarily as a guard knelt to listen . " It ca n't get you now , honey . Try to remember what it looked like . " The child swallowed , his voice becoming smaller . " It was big and black ? " " How big ? " Shannon asked . " Bigger than me ? " One teary eye looked up at her , and then the boy nodded . " B-bigger . And it had big , black wings  --  I think  --  and there was blue inside the wings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and  --  and  --  I could n't move , and neither could Laije . And then  --  and then ? " " Go on . What happened then ? " " Then it bit Laije ! It had big yellow teeth , and  --  and there was blood on its mouth when it finally let him go  --  and he was n't moving ! " " Did it come after you , then ? " Shannon insisted .  | The child yawned and nodded sleepily , his answers becoming automatic . " Uh-huh . The boolim grabbed me , and it was going to bite me , too . I could see its teeth , and Laije 's blood  --  but then it ran away . " " It ran away , " Shannon repeated , mystified . " It was going to bite you , but it ran away ? " The boy managed a sleepy nod . " Just like Laije , " he murmured . " Only  --  it did n't . I think ... " " What do you think ? " Shannon prodded , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . . . it was . . . afraid .... " " Afraid ? " Shannon breathed , though only Deller and the kneeling guard heard the echoed word . " Del , what do you make of that ? " Deller shook his head . " It 's a fantastic story . Do you 177 think it 's all true ? " " Well , I 'm sure he thinks it is . " Cradling the sleeping child close , as much in comfort to herself as to him , Shannon narrowed her eyes as if trying to recall something . " Del , do you have any idea what a boolim is ? " Deller shook his head . " Sorry , Shivaun . The boy is an Al Kaffan , though . I checked his ident tag while you were questioning him . It sounds like some fairy-tale reference . Maybe boolims are what Al Kaffan parents use to threaten their kids with if they do n't behave themselves . " " I 'll check that angle , " Shannon agreed . " In the meantime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office for a thorough going-over . Locate the boy 's parents and have them meet me in my office . Ditto for the dead boy 's parents . I need to ? " She had started to pass the sleeping boy into Deller 's arms as she spoke , but as she gathered him up , she froze in midsentence and midmovement to stare in shock at a length of stout , pale-metallic chain that had fallen across her hand from around the boy 's neck . A jewel-studded ident tag dangled from it , and Shannon had the sudden , certain suspicion that neither the tag  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Silver . She could not help remembering what she 181 had read concerning silver and vampires , and what the Setons had told her , but she was not about to risk 1 ) eller 's ridicule by mentioning her suspicion to him . Removing the chain from around the boy 's neck  --  at least the jeweled ident tab bore no cross  --  Shannon murmured a vague excuse about wanting to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest lift as fast as she dared . She punched the call button and fidgeted as the indicator light crawled toward Deck Four . The whole thing was incredible , too ludicrous for a trained scientist even to consider . She knew that things were not always what they seemed , that evidence could easily be misinterpreted , yet she could hardly ignore what apparently had happened . The boy 's attacker seemed to have been frightened away by the silver chain in her hand . That might be coincidence , but tradition had always associated silver with the warding off of evil beings  --  such as vampires . But surely there could be no such things as real vampires , and certainly not aboard a sophisticated starliner like the Valkyrie . And even if there were , it was ridiculous to suppose that such creatures would  | be repelled by such superstitiously recommended o jects as crosses , or garlic  --  or silver . Silver . The chain seemed to burn in her hand even as she thought about it , and she poured it back and forth between her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , if not the silver chain , then what had save young Nikkos Vedarras ? For that was his name , sh saw from the ident tab . Why were there not two pale , bloodied bodies lying in the corridor behind her , in stead of one ? Was it possible that there really was vampirelike being aboard the ship  --  with B-posit ! type blood that carried odd factors  --  and that it did fear silver ? The lift still had not arrived  --  it appeared to br permanently stuck at Deck Three  --  and in growing irritation , Shannon jammed her override token into the appropriate slot . The indicator began to move almost all at once , the doors soon opening on several surprised passengers . " Sorry , ladies and gentlemen : medical emergency , " she told them as she pushed aboard and pressed the button for the hold level , ignoring someone 's muffled protest in the back as she priority-keyed that as well . She would return to Seton first , she decided . She was not sure what to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mather Seton would know . Besides , Captain Lutobo and Wallis Hamilton probably were interrogating possible suspects even now . What if they should find the murderer and then themselves be attacked ? They did not know to protect themselves with silver  --  if , indeed , that was a deterrent to the being they were seeking . And if he or it had the physical strength to rip the bodies of his victims as he had She darted between the opening doors as soon as the lift came to a stop and raced to the outer door of the hold to press her palm against the ident scanner . When the door sphinctered , she ducked through that , too ,  | only to be caught for a breathless instant in a tangle field . Someone switched it off almost before she had time to feel its power , but she was breathless and still staggering a little as the Ranger named Peterson caught her under one elbow . " Commodore Seton ! Where are the captain and your wife ? " Mather , who had been conferring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security room , looked up and then stood as he saw the expression on her face . " What 's happened ? " " Another murder and an attempted murder , two decks up . " She leaned across the terminal to punch up a communications circuit . " ComNet , this is Shannon . 183 Please locate the captain for me , as quickly as possible . Ile may be on Deck Two . This is an emergency . And Smitty , " she added to the security man as she motioned for Mather to draw a little to the side , " keep on that until they find him , would you , please ? " At his nod of assent , she led Mather even farther from the console . " You 've discovered something , " Mather guessed , raising an eyebrow in question as Shannon took his hand and put a mass of warmly glowing silver and jeweled ident tag into his palm . " What 's this ? " Shannon drew a deep breath and let it out . " I think it 's silver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dare laugh . The latest victims were two children . The one who survived was wearing that around his neck . I think it 's silver , and I think it 's what saved him . " Mather 's expression did not change , but his hand tightened minutely around the heap of chain and medallion before he opened it to scrape a thumbnail tentatively against one link . " It would appear to be silver , " he said impassively ,  | " though I 'd have to test it to be sure . Were you able to get any description of the killer ? " " The boy called it a boolim , whatever that is , " Shall non said impatiently . " Smitty , have you found him yet ? " The security man flipped another set of switches and shook his head . " He does n't answer a standard page , Doctor . He must be inside one of the cabins . " " Does n't he carry a personal communicator ' ? " Mather asked . " I 've tried that , Commodore . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I doubt , or else it 's being shielded inside a room . A lot of our passengers insist on extra security and privacy protection  --  and the rooms with controlled environments , such as some of our alien passengers require , would read the same way . If you could narrow down the possibilities , though , I can override some of them , for good cause . " " I assure you , this is a good cause , " Mather said , hefting his handful of chain . " Try Lorcas Reynal 's cabin , and then work through the other passengers on our B-positive blood list . " " Yes , sir . " As Smitty set to his work , Mather turned back to Shannon . " You mentioned a boolim . Do you know what that is ? " Shannon shook her head . " Boolim is a common Al Kaffan slang term . " He glanced more closely at the ident tab . " Yes , I thought so . Young Nikkos is Al Kaffan . It 's one of those curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . In the general sense , it 's akin to the old Earther ' boogieman , ' but it has its specific roots in the Al Kaffan myth cycle as the abul-aienim , meaning he who drinks blood by night . " " In other words , " Shannon answered weakly , " a vampire . "  | " If you will . " Mather had just turned to query the security man again when the man looked up . " He is n't in any of those cabins , Commodore . " " He is n't ? " " I mean , he definitely is n't in all but one of them . I ca n't tell about number thirty-nine , on Deck Two . There 's some kind of interf ? " " Thirty-nine is Reynal 's cabin ! " Shannon said with a gasp . " There 's interference ? Is that what you were going to say ? " Mather asked , leaning over the man 's shoulder to adjust a control . " What do you mean , you ca n't tell ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his finger under a small green tally light . " Do you see that light ? It 's for cabin twenty-two , on Deck One  --  a Mister Carrington 's cabin . The green means that no one is in there . A yellow light would mean that Carrington himself was present . If the captain were there , the light would show red , since that 's who we 're looking for . But when I reset for cabin thirtynine , Deck Two " ? he pushed another series of buttons , and the tally light went off ? " I do n't get anything at all . And it is n't a malfunction in the circuits , either . I checked that already . Doctor , could there be some kind of special life-support system in cabin thirty-nine that I do n't know about ? " " Yes , there could ! " Shannon said , snapping her fingers as she remembered . " He requested a sterile air circulation system and microbe-repellent force screen for the room . I think he also wears a personal microbe shield . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is there any way to jam through a message ? " Mather asked . Smitty shook his head . " Afraid not , Commodore . Not without going up there and altering the systems that are causing the interference . "  | " Never mind . " Mather gestured to one of the Rangers . " Get the rest of our people together , Perelli . Leaveah  --  Fredricks here with the cats , and the rest of you go up to cabin thirty-nine , Level Two , and wait for us . Gather up as many of ship 's security as you can along the way and arm with stunners as well as needlers . I ) o what you think necessary , if anything happens before we can join you , but otherwise , just stand by . Any questions ? " " No , sir . " " Meanwhile , Doctor Shannon and I are going to make a detour through Medical Section , on the way . I want to make sure this is silver . " He flourished the chain in his hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Doctor , I hope that your reagent shelf is well stocked . because I think I know how to stop our vampire . " And on Deck Two , Lutobo , Wallis , Courtenay , and the two Rangers were already in cabin thirty-nine . having finally opened the door with Courtenay 's passkey when their buzzing and pounding brought no response . The room was dim inside , especially once the door closed behind them , and the five of them stood very quietly just inside the door until Wing could turn the lights up . Wallis 's medical scanner had already told them that Reynal was not in . " I wonder where he is , " Wallis said , glancing around the rather austere cabin . Other than a decanter and glass on the table beside a chair , and a few personal toilet items behind the frosted plastic of a lavatory storage cabinet , the room showed few signs of occupancy . The captain followed Wallis 's gaze and snorted . " I do n't want to even think about where he is , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going on , " he muttered , motioning for Courtenay to keep watch for Reynal 's return on the door viewer . " What kind of man is this Reynal , anyway ? " As he gestured around the pristine cabin in dis- gust , pushing a chair into better alignment with one foot , Wallis put her scanner back in her medical satchel and went briskly to a set of wall storage units , opening a drawer and riffling through the contents . " He does n't get along well with people , Captain , " she replied . " His forte is really archaeology  --  which is fortunate , since archaeologists mainly have to deal with dead people and things . He does know animals , t hough  --  and he was the best Lehr cat tracker we could find on B-Gem . Wing got along with him reasonably well , did n't you , Wing ? At least he never seemed to deliberately pick fights with you . " Wing opened a closet door and browsed casually among the few garments hanging there . " We spoke a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think he 's really 187 - pore of an anthropologist than an archaeologist . His people consider him one of the honored preservers of their lore . He told me some fascinating stories about the days before Il Nuadi was rediscovered : the Years of Light , they call it . He says that when the Empire found I1 Nuadi again and began bringing it back into the - mainstream of human civilization , they brought darkness and oblivion with them , just like the original settlers did . He says his race is dying out . " " What does he mean , his race ' ? " Wallis said , closing the last of the storage drawers to begin rifling the desk . " The present inhabitants of Il Nuadi are descended from human stock . The genetic pool may have shifted a little during four hundred years of isolation , but they 're cross-fertile with almost any other human-originated race in the Empire  --  and that 's the true test of species , after all . " " All I know is what he told me , " Wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed during the Years of Light , that they were becoming  --  godlike was the word I think he used . He says it was supposed to have been somehow tied in with the vanished native race of the planet . Reynal says ? "  | " Reynal is a very sick man , " Wallis interrupted , lifting aside a folded piece of cloth to reveal a shallow box-lid containing dozens of small ampules of a clear , straw-colored fluid . Two hypospray units lay beside the box , along with a cleaning kit . Lifting out one of the little ampules , Wallis carefully turned its label to the light . " Reparanol , " she read . " That 's a last-chance drug for inhibiting tissue rejection . " She glanced at the captain and Wing . " This does n't fit with what I know of his medical history , though . He may be just a hypochondriac , or he may have a real medical problem  --  he was always afraid he was going to catch some disease ? but you do n't take a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this could cause it . I wonder if it could also mask the lesser blood factors .... " As her voice trailed off speculatively , Lutobo picked up another of the ampules and examined it . " Is Reparanol valuable , Doctor ? I mean , is it difficult to get or something ? " " If you mean , could he be smuggling it , " Wallis said , " I should n't think so . It is n't a cheap drug , but it 's easily obtainable by those who need it , even on B-Gem . It is under moderately rigid control , in that dosage is tricky  --  you have to have a specialist 's prescription to get it  --  but I do n't know why anyone would smuggle it . Besides , the presence of the hypos suggests that it 's here to be used . " With a sigh , Lutobo put the ampule back where he had found it and began poking farther into the drawer . " All right , then , he 's a sick man . And for some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ records . That 's his right , I suppose , so long as he 's prepared to take the risks involved , but  --  here ! What 's this ? " Pulling out a stack of ship 's stationery , Lutobo pointed to several miniature power packs , no bigger than a man 's thumbnail , then yanked the drawer out  | of the desk entirely and dumped its contents on the bunk . Far at the back had been half a dozen boxes of low-load needler darts , packed twenty to the box . One box was nearly empty . " And no pistol , " Wallis siad breathlessly , when they had spread out all the contents of the drawer . " These darts are from the same manufacturer as the one I took out of our dead cat , too . " " Then Reynal is our murderer , " Lutobo murmured . " It certainly looks that way . " Lutobo shook his head . " I have to confess , I almost wish the cats had been responsible for all of this , Doctor , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lehr cats are half as cunning as the human animal . This also means that Reynal probably has the weapon on 189 him , too , does n't it ? " " I 'm afraid so , Captain . " " We 'd better put out a search for him , then , " Lutobo said , heading for the door where Courtenay had been keeping watch . " And Doctor Hamilton , I may just owe " Uh-oh , Captain , we are n't going to have to look for him , " Courtenay said suddenly , stiffening at what he saw in the door viewer . " He just came around the corner , headed this way , and there are six or eight other passengers in the vicinity . Do you want to risk a shoot-out in the corridor , or shall we try to take him in here ? " " Hide and let him get inside ! " Wing said , taking charge before Lutobo could answer and motioning with an already drawn needler for all of them to move . " Captain , get down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courtenay , hit the lights and then hide in the shower with Doctor Hamilton . Move , people ! " The two civilians obeyed immediately , instinctively recognizing Wing 's more specialized training , and Wallis and Casey were not far behind . As the young Ranger lieutenant wormed his way into the tiny closet , needler  | at the ready as he eased the door shut , the captain ducked down on the hidden side of the bunk , sweeping the telltale debris from the drawer onto the floor and also drawing his weapon . Wallis , when Courtenay had doused the lights , drew the security chief into the bathroom with her , stumbling a little in the suddenly subdued light ; she left the shower door just slightly ajar so she could see , one hand rummaging in her medical kit as quietly as possible for her knockout hypo . Endless hours seemed to pass before she heard the cabin door sigh open and then closed , and the owner of heavy footsteps immediately wrenched open the bathroom door and staggered into the little room though he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe ? and prayed that Courtenay would not , either  --  as a dark form half collapsed over the sink and began to gag , almost immediately vomiting up an enormous quantity of fluid . She could feel Courtenay fighting his own gag reflex as the stench of blood inundated their enclosed cubicle , and she almost considered using the hypo in her hand on him . But then the figure at the sink  --  it was Reynal  --  was straightening and glancing into the dark mirror , staring incredulously at the reflection behind him , and she knew that she needed Courtenay very badly . " Take him now ! " she shouted , kicking the shower door open and shoving Courtenay ahead of her as she lunged with her hypo toward Reynal 's bare wrist . It connected with empty air ; or rather , it hissed harmlessly against the microbe shield that , she immediately realized , was now a defense against far more than germs . Nor were Courtenay 's needler darts any more effective . Reynal recoiled in momentary panic , though , seizing Courtenay in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wildly as Casey and the captain exploded from cover and came  | out firing , their darts also splatting harmlessly against the shields  --  except for several that hit the already helpless Courtenay . Reynal howled at that , his golden eyes blazing and thin lips curled back in a triumphant sneer , and dropped Courtenay  --  but it was only to turn his attentions on the captain and Casey , the latter of whom dove back behind his chair to reload . As Reynal advanced on Lutobo , scorning the weapon that Lutobo emptied impotently against the shields and then threw at him , Wallis scrambled after and grabbed the decanter off the table he had just passed . But as Reynal reached Lutobo and grabbed him , too , taking him to his knees with no more than a flick of his wrist , and Wallis drew back to fling the decanter at Reynal , hoping the impact of a larger , slower projectile might at least divert him , a familiar voice suddenly called her from behind . She whirled to see Wing emerging from the closet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised his needler . But , that wo n't stop Reynal ! she thought in that instant of confusion and disbelief , just before he swung the weapon to aim squarely at her , instead ? and as she saw Casey sprawled motionless behind the chair . " What are you doing ? " she screamed . " Put it down , Doctor , " Wing said softly . " Do n't you see that you ca n't hurt him ? " She could try , though . Whirling , she drew back again to throw the decanter , just as Reynal 's hand clamped onto her shoulder at the collarbone and a jolt like a stun charge set every nerve ending screaming for relief . " Do as he says , Doctor , " Reynal whispered , though his voice seemed hollow and distant , as if filtered through layers of cotton wool . She could hardly see for the pain , as her legs buckled under her . She tried to keep hold of the decanter  | one desperate possibility for a weapon to use agai him  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure of Reynal 's relentless grasp forced h to her knees , her arms dangling bonelessly at her sid and twitching uncontrollably as raw energy continued to rage through her body . While a calm , disjointed part of her managed to observe that Reynal 's shielding dc. vice must be responsible , all instinct shrieked that she must surely pass out or even die if the pain did not cease . It did cease very shortly , as Reynal suddenly gas and released her , though she still could hardly see , much less move . It took her several seconds to realize that he had finally noticed the ampules and needier charges scattered on the floor behind the bed , some of the ampules smashed in the scuffle with Lutobo , who also lay twitching on the floor . " How did this happen ? " Reynal gasped , falling frantically to hands and knees to gather up the intact vials . " Why did you bring them here ? " He deposited a handful of ampules on the end of the bed , then groped for a hypospray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Wing replied , his attention temporarily diverted from her as he watched Reynal . Wallis could feel sensation returning  --  not fast enough ! ? but the effort of forcing order back to scrambled synapses was agonizing , and she wondered whether Wing would shoot her before she could make it to the intercom unit at the door and signal for help . " I did everything you told me , " Wing went on , " but somehow Seton found out how the cat was killed last night . He did something to the dead cat 's mate . " " He knows us , then , " Reynal said . " We are lost . " His hands shook slightly as he slipped an ampule into the hypo and sat down on the bed ; he touched a control on what looked like a wrist chronometer before triggering the hypo against his inner arm . Wallis shud- c lered at his sigh of relief and gathered herself for a dash to the door as Wing moved a few steps farther from it  --  and close to Reynal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , " Wing said quietly , shaking his head . " He does n't even suspect me , or I would n't have been allowed to come with Doctor Hamilton and the captain . They were checking on you because they matched the blood types found on ( he engineer 's knife , and also on the cat 's claws . You were merely among the first on their list , probably because of  --  Not so fast , Doctor ! " he snapped , suddenly noticing her movement and darting between her and t he door  --  for she had only been able to manage a crawl rather than the planned dash . As he planted a boot against her shoulder , shoving her helplessly onto her side , she heard Reynal chuckle . " Such a persistent woman , " he said . " Her spirit is strong . She will make a most worthy sacrifice . Shoot her , Wing , and you shall share in the glory . " Wallis 's stomach churned as she watched Wing smile and raise his weapon , but she kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for to fail was to die . She never saw the faint spark of Wing 's needler as he pulled the trigger , but she heard its faint pop , and she felt the dart sting her shoulder . The impact made her body jerk at that close range , and she thought insanely of the bruise she would have if she survived . Then she felt her balance going , her vision starting to swim , her ears beginning to ring . She did not lose consciousness as she sank back to the floor  --  the lowdose needler Wing had used was not sufficient to really knock her out  --  but she could not keep herself from falling . Dimly she was aware of Wing bending over her , of something bulky being dragged closer . Then a dark , smothering softness was being drawn across her body . It was Reynal 's cloak , full and black  --  the " wings " one of  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | page deleted  | Wing . You are not of my people , but you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall give you a clean death , if we can not escape  --  though I have a plan for that , too . " " I hope so , " Wing said quietly , " because I 've betrayed my own people for you . Even if I should survive , I 'm finished if anyone should find out . " " I shall give you a far more glorious vocation in their service , " Reynal answered , stirring himself to sit up on the bed . " Nor was your sacrifice for me , but for them . " He thumbed the ejector on the hypospray , sending the spent Reparanol ampule tumbling and twinkling toward Wallis in a high arc before it bounced on the carpet and came to rest a few feet from her paralyzed foot . " Prepare Doctor Hamilton and the captain , and then come to me , tsortse , " Reynal said , " for I must prepare you as well , if you are to taste of the gods ' ecstasy . " The click of his reloading the hypo was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to do something to the lock . Wallis 's stomach churned and knotted even more than it had before . It got worse when Wing returned and pulled the Lehr cat cloak over the armchair , fur side up , then lifted her to a halfsitting , half-reclining position between its arms , her head lolling helplessly against its back . The chair faced toward the door , only the foot of the bed visible in her peripheral vision , so she could not really see Reynal , or what he did to Wing as soon as the young Ranger had sat down near the head of the bed . She did not want to believe that Wing had actually made the conscious decision to aid Reynal , but the hiss of the hypospray convinced her that he was , indeed , won over . She saw Wing 's foot jerk as the drug hit him , and heard his stifled moan , and found herself almost hoping that Reynal had miscalculated and overdosed Wing . Death would be kinder , in the end , than  | what Mather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rest a while now , tsortse , while the drug transforms you , " she heard Reynal say . Then he was suddenly standing over her , his pale , golden eyes staring down at her with a hunger that she had never thought to see outside a nightmare . " You have been a great trial to me , Doctor , " he said softly . " Nor have the Shining Ones been as cooperative as I might have wished , despite my best efforts , in their behalf , to avenge them . Even with their voices stilled by the drugs last night , they betrayed me  --  me , the servant of the gods , their servant ! This was the thanks I got ! " He yanked back one sleeve to reveal a heavily ban- 199 daged arm , then pulled open the front of his shirt so she could see the long , angry welts splayed across part of his chest . " Reminders of my carelessness , " he said bitterly . " I should have waited for the darts to take effect more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectiveness . This would never have happened , if you had not taken the Shining Ones from I1 Nuadi ! " The sleeve was let fall , but he did not bother to refasten the shirt . " However , I can forgive you that , Doctor , once reparation has been made . Tell me , are you curious at all , before you taste oblivion ? Would it comfort you to learn how the rest of it was done ? " Wallis was far more interested in the why than the how , but she could not stop herself from watching as Reynal picked up a dark cloth bag from the floor near the door and put it on the small table close beside her chair . She had to force her eyes to focus closer as he removed a thick handful of loose blue fur , an embalmed Lehr cat paw , darkly bloodstained , and a close-fitting leather glove with steel blades set into the fingertips . The how became clear in an instant , even as Reynal  | began working the glove onto his left hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reynal asked , flexing his fingers in the steel-studded leather . " Wing 's little  --  ah ? ' improvement ' to my microbe shield enabled me to stun my victims to helplessness before they knew what hit them , as well as protecting me from attack . Then , wearing my cloak of fur and with these aids for misleading even the experts , ' is it any wonder that my hunters believed me to be a cat , especially when they knew the cats were aboard ? " He clicked the claws delicately under her nose . " Fur and claws , Doctor . And bloody paw prints . Clever , do n't you think ? I must modestly admit that the teeth were my own . " He drew back his lips at that , in a gaping caricature of a smile , and Wallis could see the bright , deadly fangs protruding from beneath his upper lip . She wondered why she had never noticed them before  --  then realized that in all the weeks she had worked with Reynal on the expedition , she had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trailed one blood encrusted claw down the side of her neck in sinister caress . Whatever else he was planning was curtailed , however , at least for the moment , by the insistent shrill of the door buzzer . With a mutter , Reynal reactivated his shield and closed his bare hand briefly across her upturned throat . His touch sent agony vibrating through all her nerve endings again , intensifying her paralysis , blinding and almost deafening her before he withdrew toward the door . Though Wallis knew she had no hope of moving , still she strained her vocal cords , hoping she might be able to make some warning sound , once Reynal opened the audio circuit . But it was futile . " Yes , what is it ? " Outside , Shannon started at the low , calm voice . She had her override key in her hand and had been about to try overriding the door as well as the audio  | circuits , but now she paused and glanced aside at Mather . Beyond the Imperial agent , three security guards waited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field to her right . " Mister Reynal , this is Doctor Shannon , ship 's surgeon , " she said , lowering her hand at Mather 's headshake . " I 'm trying to locate Captain Lutobo . " " Oh ? And what makes you think he might be here , Doctor ? " " Because the ship 's computers said he might be , " Shannon replied . " I tried to page him a little while ago , but he did n't answer . I thought the special environment in your room might be interfering with his communicator . " " How curious . Well , he is not here , Doctor . " " What about Doctor Hamilton ? " Shannon persisted , with a glance at Mather . " Have you see her ? " " Now , why would I wish to see her ? " Reynal replied . " This really is becoming most tiresome , Doctor . Good day . " As the intercom went dead , Shannon positioned her override strip again , glancing at Mather and preparing to dart out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod , she inserted it and pushed  --  but nothing happened . Shaking his head , Mather motioned her to join him , moving farther out of range as the guards eased in to fill his place . The normally mild hazel eyes were like stone . Suddenly , Shannon felt a little afraid of him . " He 's done something to the door , " she whispered . " He should n't have been able to short out my override . " Mather nodded , looking past her at Reynal 's door . " I 'm not surprised . I already knew he was lying . Wallis is in there  --  I know she is  --  but there 's something grossly wrong . " " You  --  know she 's in there ? " Shannon whispered . Mather avoided her eyes . " I  --  ah  --  it 's a talent I have for finding people . It is n't reliable for strangers or mere  | acquaintances , but  --  well , Wallis and I have been together for  --  many years . The indistinct blur I was reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or drugged , or  --  I do n't know exactly what is wrong ; just that something is wrong . " He looked at her at last . " The others must be in there , too  --  the captain , Wing and Casey , and  --  Courtenay , the security chief . " " That would make sense , " Shannon agreed . " But could Reynal have taken all five of them ? One or two , maybe , but ? " " It Reynal is responsible for what 's been happening , I think we 've completely underestimated what he may be able to do . " Mather glanced back at the guards and Rangers . " I 'm also afraid either Casey or Wing was his accomplice . I think they 're both type A-positive . I wonder what 's taking that door burner so long . " " Well , it is n't exactly standard issue on a civilian ship , " Shannon muttered . " I do n't see your men performing any miracles just now . " Mather gave her a tiny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their best , " he conceded . " I just do n't know how much time we 've got . Wallis is still alive  --  I know that much  --  and I 'm pretty sure the others are , too . But how long that will continue to be true , I could n't begin to guess . I would n't want to rush Reynal into anything rash , but I do n't think we dare delay very long . " Inside , meanwhile , Reynal and Wing had not been idle . The room was already strewn with tufts of blue Lehr cat fur . " We shall try to make them think the cats have been here , " Reynal was saying as he gathered up more of the scattered ampules , power packs , and needler charges in a satchel and checked the settings on both his hyposprays . He had also produced a highly illegal miniature stun pistol from a hiding place in the closet and stuck this in his waistband as he approached Wing .  | " The evidence still points to the cats , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All that is really necessary to keep us in the clear is a reasonable doubt . " Wing , who had dragged the half-conscious captain to a sitting position against the foot of the bed , drew back as Reynal knelt and briefly laid his bare hand against the captain 's throat again , his shields giving Lutobo another stunning jolt . Lutobo was still twitching as Reynal withdrew and turned the shields off ; and Wing braced him as he sagged more heavily against the end of the bed , breathing a little erratically . " Is n't it a little late to still be blaming the cats ? " Wing asked . " Commodore Seton knows your blood type , and he 's already connected that with the earlier deaths . Besides that , he needled them just before I left . He 'll know they could n't have come here . " " He knows nothing of the true powers of the Shining Ones , " Reynal said , snapping off the top of a Reparinol ampule and handing it to Wing with a fanatic fervor in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to assimilate the blood . " As Wing obeyed , grimacing as he sucked the ampule dry and pocketed the empty , Reynal went on . " Good . Now breathe deeply to calm yourself while I tell you what must be done afterward , for I still must perform the culminating sacrifice , once we have finished with the captain . When all is completed , we must make it look as if the cats have been here on a rampage , with only the two of us surviving . We shall destroy the evidence of our true handiwork . And afterward , when all is in confusion , we shall escape in a shuttle ship . The fools will never understand the full truth . Hold him , now . I will prepare him for you , but he is yours . Even stunned , he will try to fight at first . " Wing 's face showed no emotion as he locked down on both Lutobo 's wrists . " Seton is no fool , " he muttered .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
