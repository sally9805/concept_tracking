New York  --  Christmas had come and gone by the time the Joffrey Ballet ' s new " Nutcracker " made its debut here . Curious , yes , but no more so than this now-beloved ballet ' s somewhat checkered past . Relatively unsuccessful when first produced in 1892 at St. Petersburg ' s Maryinsky Theater , " The Nutcracker " wasn ' t seen outside Russia until 1934 . In 1940 it turned up in this country when Alexandra Fedorova , a former Maryinsky soloist , staged an abbreviated version of Lev Ivanov ' s original choreography for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo . The work drew good houses , but didn ' t become a repertory staple , possibly because , apart from the Grand Pas de Deux in the second act , it was stronger on spectacle than choreography  --  and in the days before the dance boom , a company like the Ballet Russe could not afford the lavish staging its story demanded . In 1944 , Willam Christensen mounted America ' s first complete " Nutcracker " for the San Francisco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Borzoi Book of Ballets " appeared in 1946 , there was apparently no need for a " Nutcracker " entry . Which is curious indeed if only because during the ' 40s selections from Tchaikovsky ' s " The Nutcracker Suite " achieved unprecedented popularity . In 1940 , the music was given nationwide prominence through its inclusion in Walt Disney ' s " Fantasia . " Indeed , it ' s more than possible that " The Nutcracker " was finally staged in the U.S. in order to cash in on the fame of the music . It was Balanchine ' s enormously successful 1954 production of " The Nutcracker " that made it into an American Christmas fixture . In mounting the work for New York City Ballet , he was , he said , reanimating memories from his childhood as a member of the Maryinsky School . Nevertheless , there was considerably more for him to do than simply revive an acknowledged classic . Apart from the Grand Pas de Deux , little of Ivanov ' s contribution has any permanent choreographic merit . Anyone producing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of original material , especially for the two major ensembles as well as for the divertissements that constitute act two . In effect , the work needs to be rechoreographed by every company that stages it . " The Nutcracker " must be the only 19th-century ballet classic that survives not through its steps but through its music and its story . While Tchaikovsky ' s resplendent music gives even the poorest of productions a certain artistic distinction , it is the story and the milieu that , together , make the work so irresistible . Each winter , " The Nutcracker " introduces thousands and thousands of children to a realm of fantasy and ideal moral justice . As parents realize , there is no more vivid introduction to the world of the imagination than " The Nutcracker . " For that reason , most classical companies in the U.S. make it a point to stage the work as soon as they can  --  in as dazzling a manner as possible . Despite the example of Balanchine ' s " Nutcracker , " dance values and choreographic quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenic splendor . Every penny lavished on costumes and sets is money well spent since the ballet invariably earns a profit . Better yet , it earns a company the larger part of its annual box-office income . As it becomes harder and harder for dance organizations to make ends meet , " Nutcrackers " are bound to keep on proliferating . No doubt , that is the explanation for the recent " Nutcracker " presented by the Joffrey at a cost of $1. 5 million . Though not artistically distinguished , particularly with respect to the choreography supplied by Gerald Arpino for the two big ensembles , the production has been shrewdly put together by Robert Joffrey and  --  despite some dramatic inconsistencies and some unnecessary complications in familial relationships  --  clearly staged . There are three elaborate sets by Oliver Smith . There are several striking props , including a huge teapot , out of which two Chinese dancers emerge ; and a golden rocking horse to carry the heroine to the Kingdom of Sweets . There are ingenious costumes for the mice . There is a delightfully whirling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air of good fellowship , something that the children packing the City Center here obviously enjoyed . What is absent is the revelation of spirit offered by genuine artistic distinction , the element that goes beyond the vision of small children . At the Joffrey , one misses the exhilarating grace of , say , Balanchine ' s ballabile for the Snowflakes . But the biggest single drawback is the lack of a proper climax in act two , where , instead of Ivanov ' s Grand Pas de Deux , the Sugar Plum Fairy and her Cavalier are given a compilation of fragments from various 19th-century ballets . Since the Joffrey ' s Tina LeBlanc is capable of fulfilling the most exacting demands of classical dancing , the producer ought to restore the original choreography . Meanwhile , he is to be thanked for bringing Alexander Grant from London Festival Ballet to play the mysterious Dr. Drosselmeyer , who sets all the magic in motion . Mr. Grant offers an object lesson in how to create character and meaning out of the fewest possible gestures.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
