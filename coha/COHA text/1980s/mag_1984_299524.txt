A statue helps to honor survivors of a divisive war <P> The posture of the three figures is slack , the battle dress disheveled . The faces are young and tired . The eyes are wary . There is nothing heroic about the bronze men , but together they suggest the wordless fellowship that is forged only in combat . And there can be no mistaking where they fought : Viet Nam . <P> The dedication of Frederick Hart 's seven-foot figures last week before 150,000 veterans , relatives and officials in Washington , D.C. , climaxed three days of ceremonies devoted to Viet Nam veterans . The statue , says Hart , was " deliberately designed to be a sort of anonymous snapshot . " <P> Two years ago , to honor the 2.7 million members of the U.S. armed forces who served in Viet Nam , a wall of polished black granite was erected on the Washington Mall , 500 ft. from the Lincoln Memorial . The 493.4-ft. , $4 million-plus structure , inscribed with the names of the 58,022 Americans who died or were declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a five-year fund-raising drive led by Jan Scruggs , an ex-infantry corporal who founded the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund . But the wall 's stark , understated design displeased many veterans . As a result , the veterans ' organization decided to install a more traditional artwork near by . The new statue , 100 ft. from the wall , suggests soldiers scanning the granite wall for the names of fallen comrades . <P> The dedication ceremony marked a double triumph . A Washington television station , WDVM , which had earlier charged Scruggs and other veteran organizers with misappropriating funds for the monument , retracted the story , apologized and contributed $50,000 to the memorial fund . Noting that Viet Nam vets , unlike those of America 's earlier wars , were forced to build their own memorial , Scruggs said , " As it turned out , the monument has more of an impact being done privately . It was Viet Nam veterans taking care of their buddies . " <P> The closing ceremony was attended by General William C. Westmoreland , the former Viet Nam theater commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a subdued tone , Reagan , who had angered vets by not attending the wall 's dedication two years ago , called those who had served in Viet Nam true patriots . " I believe that in the decade since Viet Nam the healing has begun , " said the President , " and I hope that before my days as Commander in Chief are over the process of healing will be complete . " <P> For some , the weekend came close to achieving that end . " If the country rejected us , and it did , " said John Ruehlmann , 37 , a former Army sergeant , " we can get together here , bound by the monument . " That harmony was expressed in a variety of ways , from a candlelight vigil to a ' 60s nostalgia concert by Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons ; the mood throughout shuttled between tearful meditation and joyous , beery reunions . At the end , just about everyone seemed to feel a little better . <P> " The monument , " explained Everett Alvarez Jr. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be shot down over North Viet Nam , " marks the final step of dedicated effort to overcome the past .
