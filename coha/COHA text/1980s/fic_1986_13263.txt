BITSY Figure skating is what girls do , Justine . ( DAVID take shots on JASON as JUSTINE explains . ) JASON Come on , David . Try to deke me out .

He says I like it because of the adrenalin . But why do I like the adrenalin ? JUSTINE The coach says David thinks too much . It slows him down . DAVID I like the feeling you get skating out on new ice . I like the feeling you get just before the ref drops the puck . I like the feeling get on a breakaway , when you know everything 's right , it 's going to work , when you 're concentrating so hard that things that were colour go to black and white and you ca n't even hear the crowd anymore . JUSTINE David wrote a poem about hockey once . DAVID It was n't a poem . JUSTINE He was inspired by one of those big machines that clean the ice . DAVID It was an essay . JUSTINE A poetic essay .

Look , do n't ask me to explain , okay ? JASON Hey , David , how come you and Justine were born in the same year , but you 're not twins ? JUSTINE ( to audience ) . . . Because it 's boring to explain . DAVID ( to JASON ) Because Justine was born in January and I was born in December . JUSTINE Because when people find out , all they say is " Boy , your mother must have been busy that year . " JASON Boy , your mother must have been busy that year .

JUSTINE A what ? BITSY For every winner , there 's a loser , right ? I mean , you ca n't have winners without losers . Winners minus losers equals zero . And zero plus zero is not exactly progress . JUSTINE But what if you 're winning . And you keep winning . BITSY My mom says sports is just aggression . JASON What 's wrong with that ? BITSY She says we have sports and the stock market and the nuclear arms race and it 's all the same thing . JASON What 's wrong with that ? BITSY Did you show your father your report card , Jason ?

And now that I 've thought about it , I still feel sick , because it 's true , is n't it ? It is me they do n't want , no matter how many times they say it is n't personal . It 's because I 'm a girl , but they still do n't want me . JUSTINE 'S LAWYER Do n't worry , Justine . Do n't cry . JUSTINE I 'm not crying . Not exactly . p. 34 JUSTINE 'S LAWYER We 'll win the appeal . JUSTINE You think so ? Really ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're just stalling . JUSTINE How long can they stall ? JUSTINE 'S LAWYER They hope you 'll give up . Are you going to give up ? JASON Hey , Justine ? Is she one of the feminists ? JUSTINE 'S LAWYER I beg your pardon ? JASON I think you should leave Justine alone . JUSTINE 'S LAWYER I beg your pardon ? JASON My dad do you think what your dad thinks ? JASON Justine just wants to play hockey , do n't you , Justine ? JUSTINE Yes , but . . . JASON Do you know what will happen if you take the MTHL to court ? If you sue the East Enders ? The club will collapse , Justine . JUSTINE 'S LAWYER Do n't believe him , Justine . p. 35 JUSTINE I do n't know . JASON You wo n't be able to play . Neither will anyone else . Is n't that more important than what you want ? JUSTINE I do n't know . JUSTINE 'S LAWYER Do n't believe him , Justine . JUSTINE I do n't know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LAWYER ( exit ) Fight for your rights , Justine . JASON ( exit ) Remember your friends , Justine . JUSTINE ( sings ) Wait a minute Does it have to be this tough ? If I 've passed every test And I 'm doing my best Is that still not enough ? ( BITSY enters . ) BITSY What 's the matter , Justine ? JUSTINE I ca n't do it . BITSY Do what ? JUSTINE Be everything everybody wants me to be . All at once . BITSY At least you 're not Jason . Because his dad wants him to be a Supreme Court Judge . ( JASON enters with DAVID and a new equipment bag. ) p. 36 JASON Congratulate me , girls . BITSY And Jason ca n't even spell Supreme Court . JASON I have signed with an MTHL team . I 'm a Jet . JUSTINE Jason , the Jets are jerks . JASON Justine , you 're jealous . JUSTINE They 're jerks . They play bozo gazoonie hockey . They 're all brain donors . JASON You 're speaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care . DAVID Justine , calm down . . . JUSTINE It is n't fair , David . DAVID I know how you feel , but . . . BITSY Why do you think it 's supposed to be fair ? JUSTINE Jason gets to play MTHL . Just because he 's a guy . It is n't that he knows the plays . It is n't that he has the skills . . . BITSY Did you ever think what it would be like if boys could play on girls ' teams ? JUSTINE Bitsy , do n't start . . . BITSY If they let boys on the gym team or the swim team . They 'd take over . There would n't be a girls ' team . p. 37 JUSTINE Bitsy , please . . . we 're supposed to be friends . BITSY Or what if all the girls who were any good played for the boys ' teams ? I guess the girls ' teams would get even wimpier , would n't they ? JUSTINE I just want to do my best . BITSY You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BITSY Thanks Justine . JUSTINE You do n't care about anything . BITSY What you do n't understand is , I try not to care . About whether it 's fair or not . Because I look at my mother who is just as smart as my father and she was his secretary before he married her . And I look at my sister , she is somewhat smarter than the jerk she married , is n't she ? But she quit school to put him through school . And I look at my father who has a new secretary and a new wife and a condo in Ajax and my mom has custody and she works at the IGA when he forgets to send support . JUSTINE It does n't have to be that way . BITSY Does n't it ? JUSTINE Bitsy . . . BITSY You have to learn not to care about stuff like that , Justine . And sit back . You can listen to my Walkman . ( Exit BITSY , followed by JUSTINE. ) p. 38 JUSTINE You ca n't just quit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you think Justine is better than you are ? At hockey ? DAVID That is such a stupid question . JASON She 's faster than you are . DAVID We 're different . JASON She 's stronger than you are . Does that bother you ? DAVID Look , Jason , she grew faster than I did . That happens . People grow at different rates . People have growth spurts and some people mature faster than other people , that 's all . JASON You know what my dad heard ? DAVID I do n't care . JASON He heard the only reason you got signed was because of Justine . DAVID Oh , sure . JASON Your coach wanted Justine and your mom said he 'd have to take you . DAVID Justine is n't playing , Jason . They wo n't even let her on the ice . JASON They say your coach wanted the publicity . p. 39 DAVID Publicity , that 's crazy . JASON He wants his name in the papers , that 's all . Since he has n't got Justine . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jason . JASON He 's in the papers all the time . He 's on tv and so 's Justine . So what 's it like , David ? When your sister 's a star ? DAVID She is n't a star . JASON Why do n't you sell your story ? To those papers in the supermarket . You know , right by the checkout stand . DAVID Never mind . JASON ( pretends he 's reading ) " Aliens taught my canary to sing . " Boring . But wait . Here 's " My sister plays hockey " . By David Blainey . . . Now that is truly alien , that is deeply weird . . . DAVID I said back off . ( And DAVID attacks JASON . They wrestle . JUSTINE enters . ) JUSTINE David . . . Jason . . .

DAVID Never mind , Justine . JUSTINE Why do guys have to fight all the time ? What are they trying to prove ? DAVID What are you trying to prove ? JUSTINE I beg your pardon ? DAVID Why ca n't you be like everybody else ? JUSTINE Meaning what ? DAVID Meaning why do you have to play hockey ? JUSTINE You play hockey . p. 41 DAVID I mean , why ca n't you be like your friends and stay home and watch your soaps . Like Bitsy . JUSTINE Bitsy does n't watch soaps . DAVID Bitsy does n't make waves . JUSTINE What are you trying to say ? DAVID Bitsy does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ News . No one cares about Bitsy . JUSTINE And you do n't care about me , do you , David ? DAVID I just got murdered for you , Justine . JUSTINE You do n't care what I want or what I do . As long as no one notices . DAVID Everybody notices everything you do . And everybody thinks you 're weird . JUSTINE You know something that really bothers me . If you want something , really want something , you just assume you can do it . You can play hockey or take off for Mexico , or start a rock band or join the Forest Rangers . DAVID You do n't want to join the Forest Rangers . JUSTINE But if I did , David . . . DAVID You 'd look pretty silly running through the forest in high heels . p. 42 JUSTINE That 's so stupid , David . ( JUSTINE 'S LAWYER enters . ) JUSTINE 'S LAWYER Are you ready , Justine ?

To the Supreme Court . This is real . JUSTINE The Supreme Court ? DAVID Justine 's going to the Supreme Court ?
