For reasons that escape him , James Baldwin is considered an expatriate writer whose spirit was so crushed by the racial convulsions of America , years ago , that he fled to Paris ; there , according to legend , he assumed the role of angry black prophet , warning white America of an imminent holocaust  --  the fire next time . This impression of Baldwin  --  as an embittered exile , full of hate and damnation for his native land  --  is a source of eternal grief , he says . . . . " But what am I to do about it ? Dress up like Santa Claus ? I ' m completely helpless . It ' s an inconvenient garment . It scratches and makes me bleed . When I was younger , it made me cry . Sometimes it makes me cry now . " Sometimes it makes him angry . " I always wonder how people think that in my exile in Paris I managed to meet Martin Luther King and Malcolm X , " he says , caustically . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . yesterday . I came back to go on the civil rights road , which I did , and I was based in America when Martin was murdered . I left the country about a year later and ended up in the south of France . I ' d been very ill , probably as a result of that assassination . Martin was dead and Malcolm was dead and Medgar ( Evers ) was dead and many others were gone , but I was still alive . I had to find a way to begin again , and since then I ' ve been a trans-Atlantic commuter . " For dramatic emphasis , Baldwin leans over and holds out a fragile wrist to show the watch that was given to him by King ' s widow , Coretta ; it has King ' s image on the face and , in place of numbers , letters that spell out his credo , " I have a dream . " Baldwin is sitting in his New York " office , " a West Side pub/restaurant called the Ginger Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s apartment and only a few miles from the Harlem neighborhood where he was born and grew up . Baldwin has a regular corner table in the restaurant , next to the fireplace , where he likes to " have a drink , count over my blues and meditate on my sins . " In recent days , Baldwin has had little time for meditation . He is in New York at the behest of his publisher , Holt , Rinehart &; Winston , to celebrate a new book , " The Evidence of Things Not Seen . " Last night , there was a late dinner party at an elegant 5th Avenue restaurant , during which he spoke of the personal crisis caused by the book and recited a poem called " Gypsy , " which would seem to describe his present state of mind and body . In a few hours , he will return to Amherst , Mass. , where he is spending the academic year as " writer in captivity " at the University of Massachusetts . Further down the road is a trip to Chicago for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occasion , which falls next Friday , puzzles as much as it delights him . " I have no idea what it ' s all about , " he says . " It ' s kind of mysterious , isn ' t it ? Can a publisher arrange such a thing ? I doubt it . " Baldwin says he has yet to meet Mayor Washington , but he does have a lot of other Chicago friends whom he is looking forward to seeing . He expects the visit to be altogether more congenial than an earlier one that is engraved in his memory . " Two other black cats and I went into a bar at the airport and the bartender refused to serve us . He said we looked too young . I was about 37 , old enough to be the bartender ' s father , and my friends were about the same age . It wasn ' t our ages at all , of course . It was our color . " Baldwin draws his chair nearer the fire , which gives the richly paneled room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 61 , he has a sad , ageless look , at least to judge by photos of him 20 or more years ago , and a slight , almost delicate body that seems barely capable of supporting his head . He also has a bad cold , and that  --  possibly in combination with the effects of cigarettes and scotch  --  adds a deeper resonance to his voice , which is an odd mixture of biblical and theatrical tremolos , brimstone exhortations and hoarse whispers . Contributing to his discomfort is the presence of an interrogator , whose questions he is answering , politely but somewhat impatiently . He is also awaiting , with even less enthusiasm , his lawyer , who has insisted on a meeting to discuss copyright problems with another recently published Baldwin book , " The Price of the Ticket , " a large gathering of his autobiographical writings . That collection , however , seems of little immediate concern to Baldwin ; much more urgent is " The Evidence of Things Not Seen , " which is coming out almost simultaneously , though from a different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry into the Atlanta child murders , a postmortem that required four traumatic journeys to Atlanta ( further evidence , Baldwin notes , if any is needed , that he hasn ' t simply retired to foreign shores to brood about America ' s racial agonies ) . Baldwin first went to Atlanta in 1981 for Playboy , an assignment prompted by public skepticism about the guilt of Wayne Williams , who had been convicted of two murders ( neither of them children ) and was presumed to be the culprit in most , if not all , of the other 27 . " The verdict had raised all kinds of questions and dissension in the black community , " Baldwin says . Many people , whites among them , felt that Williams had not been proven guilty , that he was a scapegoat , whose conviction was merely the most expedient way of turning off the heat and notoriety the case had generated for " progressive " Atlanta , " the city too busy to hate . " Before he appeared on the scene , Baldwin says he hadn ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter , not knowing what I was going to find , not knowing , really , what I felt or thought about it . It was simply a rather horrifying case , and I was flying by radar . Anyone who would talk to me , I talked to . I listened . I listened to what was being said , I listened to what was not being said . Then I tried to put it all together and get some kind of picture of the meaning of the event . " Among those Baldwin talked and listened to were families of the slain and missing children and the parents of Wayne Williams . He did not get to talk to Williams himself , though not for lack of trying . " Someone from ' 60 Minutes ' saw him just before I was supposed to , and apparently the reaction to that discouraged the authorities , whoever they may be , from allowing him to be interviewed again . . . . In any case , I don ' t quite know what difference it would have made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been found , but " after six or seven , I simply could not do that to myself any longer . . . . It was just too devastating . " From everything he heard and saw , Baldwin concluded that the rumors were true : That Williams had not been proven guilty . He notes the absence of fingerprints connecting Williams to the crimes ; the absence of any pattern to the murders , which would indicate not a single , serial killer , but several ; the absence of any credible evidence whatsoever . He suggests that Williams became one of the " slaughtered children " himself , yet another sacrificial victim of white America ' s delusion that " the free black man is a bad nigger . " Throughout the book , it is the larger racial issues that preoccupy Baldwin , not the question of Williams ' guilt or innocence , which he says is " beside the point . " Nonetheless , readers accustomed to the force and the point-blank eloquence of Baldwin ' s prose , particularly in such essays as " Notes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Street , " may be surprised and dismayed by how indirectly the author makes his case . In its digressions and circumlocutions , the brief book seems less like investigative journalism than a jeremiad on the pervasive evils of white supremacy , as well as the " murderous implications " of the Williams verdict for all of America . To the suggestion that " Evidence " contains sermonistic overtones  --  that he occasionally sounds more like an evangelist ( which he used to be , during his teens in Harlem ) than a journalist  --  Baldwin responds with visible irritation . Drawing himself erect and gesturing theatrically , he says : " I don ' t see how you can attack the case directly . It is not a headline , it is not a television show . As I say , I was trying to find out the meaning of the events . Is that oblique ? " My mission was really very simple . I was trying to put the reader in my place , so he could look at the evidence with me . In such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader . I have to do it the way I did it . You look at it , is what I ' m saying . I don ' t know what to make of it , what do you make of it ? What do you think happened ? I can not possibly sort through the maze of corpses and say ( a ) . . . ( b ) . . . ( c ) , this is what happened . I ' m not writing ' J ' Accuse . ' If I were , who would I accuse ? All I ' m saying is that Wayne Williams may well be guilty , but I smell a rat . " Despite its frequently sardonic tone , Baldwin does not want his book to be interpreted as an anti-American , anti-white polemic , and he is clearly distressed that some people consider him a vessel of black wrath and anger , rather than a voice of love and moderation , that his distorted image is based on an ignorance or a misreading of his essays and novels . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hate this country , " he says . " If I hated this country I ' d never come back to it . It ' s the country I love more than any other in the world , but we have a potential which we don ' t use . And if you waste , you want . That ' s what my Momma taught me : If you waste , you will want . And we are wasting a vast amount of human energy and morale and possibilities in the name of this delusion called white supremacy . " " Evidence of Things Past , " Baldwin says , " is a kind of love song . It is a love song to my country , to my ancestors and yours . We can ' t discuss my ancestors without discussing yours , or vice versa . My grandmother was a slave . She had 14 children . Some of them came out of her womb looking like me , and they were called black ; and some of them came out looking like you , and they were called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same woman . What a thing it is to deny that ! " You can ' t prove you ' re white . I know you can ' t . A lot of my ancestors were also yours . I am your brother . I am also your uncle and your son , and your way of life is designed to protect you from this knowledge . . . . In that context , since the republic imagines itself to be white  --  I say imagines itself because it isn ' t  --  it is living a delusion . A very . . . dangerous . . . delusion . There ' s nothing more dangerous than a nation of sleepwalkers . " There ' s so much needless unhappiness here . This country has the potential which is not , so far as I know , contained in any other country in the world . And we repudiate it . . . . It ' s very important to remember that not so long ago we were considered the last best hope of Earth , " he says , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We hold these truths to be self-evident . . . . " Baldwin ' s voice fades before he can finish , and he settles back in his chair , weary , anxious to unwind . But his lawyer has arrived with papers to be read and signed , and it ' s beginning to look like another long evening . In a few weeks , he was to be summoned to Atlanta , to press for a new trial in the Williams case . Then on to Chicago. . . . and beyond . If Baldwin has not yet earned a rest , though , he can surely take comfort in the thought that , as an elder statesman among black writers of his generation , he has earned his place on a mountaintop . " Yes , " he says , " but I just wish that I were not so alone . " CITY SETS JAMES BALDWIN DAY By official proclamation of Mayor Washington , next Friday is James Baldwin Day in Chicago .
