The festival is held each year on June 16 , the day in 1904 in which all the events of ' ' Ulysses , ' ' including Bloom ' s breakfast , took place . If any day captures the spirit of Dublin , whose unofficial anthem is Molly Malone ' s refrain , ' ' Alive , alive O , ' ' it is Bloomsday , an event ' ' without official programme , ' ' but with plenty of high spirits , readings , recitations , and reenactments of Joyce ' s tome , preferably done in Edwardian costume. // It could not be a more appropriate year in which to go by the book : in the middle , as it were , of Dublin ' s millennium year , celebrating 1 , 000 years of Irish urban history . If the date - 988 - seems rather ad hoc to some people - including Millennium staff member Jill McDermott - then never mind . It would only spoil the good crack , as they say , of this once-in-a-1 , 000-years party. // // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vikings held Celtic Dublin ( Dubh Linn , or ' ' dark pool , ' ' from the peat-colored waters of the River Liffey ) from 795 to 1014 , but ' ' King Mael Sechnaill II laid siege to Dublin and won it , more or less , for the Irish in 988 . ' ' Hence the hoopla : some 1 , 200 events and $9 million worth of festivities to lure an extra 250 , 000 visitors to Dublin ' s fair city. // And why not ? For Dublin , with its confusing history and jumbled architecture ( the original Parliament building is now a bank ; the real Parliament building used to be a duke ' s summer home and is next to the National Library where Joyce studied , so guess which is more revered ) is nothing if not its citizenry. // It is the city ' s enduring legacy : a garrulous hospitality that has persisted from Joyce ' s day on ; a relaxed friendliness somewhere between British reserve and Yankee brazenness that stamps Dublin as its own . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' walk you are just as likely to encounter a BBC camera crew as you are to find Joyce ' s nephew , ruddy-cheeked Ken Monaghan , who will cheerfully tell you , ' ' Oh , I never met the man . He never came back to Dublin while I was alive , but my mother said , ' Yes , he was very different. ' ' ' // It is somewhat ironic , then , that this ' ' conversation capital of the world , ' ' according to Dublin ' s lord mayor , Alderman Carmencita Hederman , is hosting its first-ever International Writers Conference as a focal point of the Millennium . The mayor welcomed to Dublin more than two dozen writers : foreigners , including Nigerian poet Chinua Achebe and Israeli novelist Yehuda Amichai , plus the home-grown talent , poet Seamus Heaney and the old Irish writer Sean O ' Tuama . The mayor posed again the question that has been asked since the first Celtic storyteller opened his mouth : ' ' Why do the Irish have such a gift with the word ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the mayor , ' ' please come up later and tell me. ' ' // As writer Leon Uris put it , the city ' s history has ' ' been forged by men of letters and men of insurrection . ' ' Indeed , more ' ' bukes ' ' are bought and read here than in any other country , with the possible exception of neighboring Great Britain . Creative writers are offered - and accept - tax-free status , no mean concession when most others can pay up to 60 percent . The tiny emerald isle of only 3 million-plus people has produced three Nobel Prize-winning writers ( Beckett , Yeats , and Shaw ) , plus all the non-prizewinning ones ( Joyce and the rest ) . ' ' Only in Ireland are authors treated like film and pop stars , ' ' says the mayor. // And these are the most obvious of the city ' s literary echoes , which you can hear on any street corner and in any of the hundreds of smoky pubs . It is not that every Dubliner is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this size , a town masquerading as a city , its most noticeable contingent is , again , its citizens. // Whether in print or on their two feet , the Irish have been their country ' s most enduring export . Ever since the Great Potato Famine and again today , Ireland has faced an erosion of its people . Indeed , the Millennium falls in a decade when Dublin , and the country as a whole , face a crushing foreign debt , continued high unemployment , and almost nonstop emigration of its young . ' ' Boatloads of them , every week , ' ' says Padder Greer , wheeling his taxi along Dublin ' s streets . ' ' Nothing you can do , no work , no prospects . To the young , the Millennium is stupid . They have nothing to celebrate. ' ' // But talk to Benedict Kiely , the author of 18 books and one of Dublin ' s snowy-haired bards , who in the cool recesses of his Donnybrook flat will , like any good Dubliner , quote you Yeats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young leave ? It ' s a small island . I like it fine and never left , but Joyce did , Beckett did . ' ' And then Mr. Kiely will invite you to tea , like any good Dubliner , and show you pictures of Maude Gonne , Yeats ' s true love and Ireland ' s doyenne of politics , and tell you , ' ' I was in the room when that picture was taken . ' ' And then come Yeats ' s lines : ' ' When you are old and gray and full of sleep , nodding by the fire. . . . ' ' // Or step out into the dazzling summer sun and have a word with Ann O ' Neill , one of the city ' s official Millennium tour guides . Everyone ' s interested in ' ' the Viking aspect this year , ' ' Mrs. O ' Neill says , just a stone ' s throw from the Irish Life Viking Adventure , an authentically recreated Viking village that is one of Millennium ' s biggest exhibits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now in the crypts of St. Audeon ' s one can tour a modified version of that metropolis-no-longer , along with the scores of uniformed schoolchildren whose excited shouts fill the soft air. // There are ranks of other children , less in tune to the festivities but still the future soul of Dublin : children , like blond , freckle-faced Suzanne Doyle , who live in public housing projects in Ringsend , where Joyce had Bloom perambulate 84 years earlier , and where the Joyce Society took its annual ' ' Ulysses ' ' walk this year. // ' ' Are you Americans ? ' ' Suzanne hollers out at the odd group standing bareheaded under the sun clutching the massive volume and reading aloud the pertinent scenes . When told it ' s a walk celebrating James Joyce , Dublin ' s illustrious writer , she asks , ' ' Oh , is he famous , then ? ' ' But then see how quietly she and her friends join the group , listening to Robert Nicholson , the trim , gray-haired curator of the Joyce Museum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s Dublin , ' ' who is reading from somewhere deep in the fifth chapter. // Mr. Nicholson is the one who will preside over that Bloomsday kidney breakfast ; the very Nicholson who also heads up the Joyce Society ' s weekly meetings in University College , where Joyce himself studied . The group has been reading and discussing ' ' Finnegan ' s Wake ' ' every Tuesday since 1984 , and they have now reached Page 543 . In the robin ' s-egg-blue room , home first to Joyce and now this band of Dubliners , Nicholson and a handful of others read on - a living connection to the past and , if one of the quietest , perhaps the most fitting tribute to the city ' s thousand years. // ' ' Right , ' ' says Nicholson as you , the odd visitor , depart after weathering the dissection of a few pages . ' ' Right . Look forward to seeing you on Bloomsday . ' ' And as you head on into the adjacent St. Stephen ' s Green , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skyline and the mist begins to rise on the lawn of putting-green perfection , you think of Gabriel Conroy ' s toast to his fellow Dubliners in Joyce ' s story , ' ' The Dead ' ' : ' ' I feel more strongly with every recurring year that our country has no tradition which it does so much honor and which it guards so jealously as that of its hospitality. ' ' // That is , Millennium or no , something worth celebrating. // //
