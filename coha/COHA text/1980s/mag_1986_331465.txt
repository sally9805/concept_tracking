It was a dream palace , an exuberant art deco fantasy , but year after year fewer people came . Despite its exalted status as a temple of family entertainment and the " Showplace of the Nation , " Manhattan 's Radio City Music Hall would have closed if a few changes had not been made . And what changes they were ! Where Snow White once graced the screen , Madonna has become a queen of the stage . In the hall where the movie King Kong premiered , the closest thing to a horror show these days is a concert by the shockrock group Twisted Sister . In addition to the high-kicking Rockettes ( who still show up from time to time ) , audiences are now treated to sights such as 12-ft. dancing mummies and walls of flame . <P> The jarring transformation worked , and the people came back . Radio City Music Hall Productions revealed last week that it earned $2.5 million in 1985 , the first annual profit for the world 's largest indoor theater since 1955 . Said Richard Evans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Call it the Miracle on Sixth Avenue or whatever , but the Music Hall is again the vibrant , healthy entertainment center that it once was . " <P> After taking charge of the Music Hall in 1980 , Evans quickly dropped traditional family entertainment in favor of more contemporary fare , from bacchanalian rock concerts by the likes of Iron Maiden and Adam Ant to comedy acts featuring such stars as Bill Cosby and Eddie Murphy . Evans also brought in a few old reliables , including Johnny Mathis and Liberace , who broke box- office records last year by filling the 6,000-seat auditorium for 21 performances . At the same time , Evans has turned the Music Hall into an entertainment conglomerate that sponsors concerts elsewhere , produces plays and TV specials , and stages sales meetings and gala product introductions for major corporations . <P> The live performances , which form the core of the theater 's new format , represent a return to the Music Hall 's earliest days . Those who attended the opening night on Dec. 27 , 1932 , saw 17 acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wallendas . But Depression-era audiences were eager for the escapism that Hollywood films provided , and the house soon became famous for world movie premieres . <P> By the 1940s the Music Hall was the most popular entertainment attraction in Manhattan . Both New Yorkers and tourists waited hours for tickets to the opening of such postwar films as Mister Roberts , An American in Paris and Singin ' in the Rain . Along with the movie , they saw the Rockettes , the troupe of 36 dancers who remain the living symbols of the hall . <P> But suburban theaters and the public 's desire for something racier than family fare gradually drove attendance down . It fell from 5 million a year in 1967 to less than 2 million a decade later . By 1978 Rockefeller Center , the Music Hall 's owner , planned to close it for good . That prompted a nationwide outcry that led New York City to designate the interior a landmark that had to be preserved . After a $2.5 million renovation that restored the original appearance of everything from the 24-karat gold-leaf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall reopened on May 31 , 1979.
