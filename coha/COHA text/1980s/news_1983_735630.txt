txt Allegheny Ludlum Steel Corp. , which quit the steel industry 's multiemployer bargaining group in February . negotiated a separate contract with the United Steelworkers union that calls for smaller wage concessions than those won last month by the group 's remaining seven steelmakers The 42-month contract reached Friday between the USW and the closely held maker of specialty steels temporarily cuts the wages of about 5,400 workers by 50 cents an hour . By contrast , a ** agreement ratified in early March between the union and the seven larger , basic-steel producers temporarily reduced wages by $1.25 an hour . That contract covers 263.000 workers , more than 3% of whom are on layoff . Allegheny Ludlum 's slimmer concessionary package reflects both the steel market 's recent upturn and the fact that the concern has been operating at a small profit , USW officials said . The other steelmakers , which together had losses of more than $3 billion last year and continue to show deficits , were able to make a more persuasive case for concessions , these officials added . The union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved by the possibility that had the company failed to reach a contract , it could have faced a strike Aug . I. This is when the old agreement , superseded by the new pact . was scheduled to expire . In the event of such a strike , basic steelmakers with specialty operations could be expected to take market share from Allegheny Ludlum . An Allegheny Ludlum official said the new agreement , which expires Oct. 1 , 1986 , or two months after the basic steelmakers ' pact ends , " is n't as competitive as we 'd like it to be . " But he added that " nobody ever gets the type of agreement they would like to have . " The official also defended the company 's decision to withdraw from the bargaining group . saying , " Looking back , it was the proper decision . " He did n't elaborate on the reasons for the company 's withdrawal , which was made without public explanation . But union sources said Allegheny Ludlum came to believe that the multiemployer group 's bargaining goals in certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expense . Besides the 50-cent wage cut , which is to be restored in three increments over the pact 's life , the Allegheny Ludlum agreement also calls for the company to contribute 25 cents an hour next year to workers ' individual retirement accounts and to offer the equivalent of another 25 cents an hour in the form of sweetened pension benefits for certain older workers who agree to early retirement over the next several months . The two company payments are roughly comparable to provisions in the basic steel agreement that increase company payments to a supplemental unemployment benefit fund and improve early-retirement benefits . Certain other terms of the agreement are similar to those in the basic steel pact , including pledges to reinvest any labor-cost savings in steel facilities , restrictions on cost-of-living payments and reductions in certain holiday , vacation and overtime bene-fits Neither the union nor Allegheny Ludlum would estimate the extent of the savings under the new pact . Allegheny Ludlum 's total average hourly employment costs have been in the same 823-an-hour range as those of the basic steelmakers.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
