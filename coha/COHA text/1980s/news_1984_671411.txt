This funhouse-cum-restaurant is the brainchild of David Keh and Ed Schoenfeld , the Barnum &; Bailey of New York restaurants . Their gastronomic horse-and-pony show has featured the late David K ' s on Third Avenue near 65th Street as well as Auntie Yuan on First Avenue , the new Cafe Marimba on the site of the old David K ' s and an American-style restaurant that is to open in the same building. // The silliness at Pig Heaven belies some of the most serious and authentically delicious Chinese food around . ( Those who do not eat pork have a choice of many other dishes. ) // One can start with excellent dumplings - fried , boiled or steamed - prepared by Chef Mu Huai Ming , a Chinese dumpling ringer recruited from China . The tubular fried version , brashly seasoned with ginger and black pepper , is crisp and golden brown on the bottom , soft on top . These fried dumplings are so addictive one could make a meal of them . Equally tasty are the hand-crimped steamed and boiled dumplings that spurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other appetizers worth trying are the cold hacked chicken , shards of white meat swathed in a zesty combination of sesame paste and hot oil ; sesame-flavored scallion pancakes , and a dish called vegetarian duck . The ersatz duck is a curious creation in which tofu is compressed into chewy , strudel-like sheets that are layered with mushrooms and served in a mild soy-based dressing . The texture is fascinating , although the dish needs hoisin sauce to add some flavor. // Those with venturesome tastes should try the shredded pig ' s ears and the Hunan spicy kidneys . The ears , a delicacy in China , are tossed with shredded scallions in a sparkling sesame oil vinaigrette . It is a mild-flavored salad enjoyable mostly for its crunchy texture . Impeccably fresh kidneys , blanched and sliced in flowerettes , are served with a Hunanese black peppercorn sauce that has a slightly bitter and numbing edge - appealing in a painful sort of way. // Appetizers that do not hold up as well are the thin crusty vegetable pie served with pancakes , a leaden and redundant concoction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls. // What does one drink with this kind of food ? Beer is a natural . From the tiny wine list , the most appropriate selection might be the fresh and acidic Gew " urztraminer Reserve Weinbach ( 1983 ) for $19. // There are 19 pork specials . The Cantonese-style suckling pig at Pig Heaven is truly heavenly . The skin is potato chip-brittle , and underneath are a layer of fat and a strip of juicy meat . It will never make the American Heart Association ' s menu suggestions , but you are certain to leave the restaurant with a smile . Another good selection is minced pork sauteed with corn , bell peppers and pine nuts. // Fish is prepared with equal skill , especially the whole braised carp with Sichuan hot bean sauce and the braised red snapper with whole garlic cloves . The giant carp is cooked to a turn and served under a brown sauce with aromatic minced herbs and spices . However , it is not nearly as hot as advertised . The snapper comes in a piquant sauce with chunks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Three-glass chicken , a house specialty , is worth trying . The cut-up chicken is placed in a crock , mixed with ginger and assorted vegetables , and doused with a glass each of Chinese rice wine , soy sauce and water . It is covered and cooked until the sauce reduces to intensely flavorful brown drippings. // Orange beef , a Chinese-restaurant cliche , is rehabilitated here . The burnished slices of remarkably tender meat are coated with a semisweet orange glaze and flecked with seared slivers of orange rind . Our table nearly came to a chopstick duel over it. // Among the side dishes , sauteed watercress is extraordinarily good - sizzling and refreshing . Less satisfying are the mushy pan-fried noodles and the rather ordinary stewed eggplant. // The largely non-Oriental waiters are amiable and well-informed about the menu . They manage to keep their cool when nights are hectic , which is often. // Desserts are a far cry from the usual litchi nuts and fortune cookies . The crusty and custardy bread pudding with orange sauce is irresistible . Frozen praline mousse , studded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sundae . A whimsical way to end the meal is with a Peking snowball , an igloo of whipped cream encasing a deadly rich chocolate core . Garnished with some silly cookies , it looks like something that would be served at an 8-year-old ' s birthday , which seems fitting here .
