SPY LINE by Len Deighton ; Knopf ; 291 pages ; $18.95 <P> Never mind the Soviet economy , Mikhail Sergeyevich ; what have you done to the spy-thriller industry ? Now that the Berlin Wall has started coming down , cold warriors are not the only ones whose smiles must seem a trifle forced . Spy novelists , like Pentagon budgeteers , need the Wall to make their fictions believable . What 's a secret agent to do now ? Set up a kiosk and sell FREIHEIT T shirts ? <P> The grim central image of modern spy literature is the death of Alec Leamas , shot by G.D.R . Grenzpolizisten at the Wall in the last scene of The Spy Who Came In from the Cold . John le Carre 's bleak and entirely believable novel was published in 1963 , only two years after the East German regime built the Wall . Since then , Le Carre 's surviving operatives and those of Len Deighton , another notable English spymaster , have made dodgy livings evading Vopos at the Wall , armed with little but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Now , with the border Vopos tossing flowers and grinning like Father Christmas , the Berlin Wall has suddenly lost the cachet it once had for spy writers . For Le Carre the timing of the Wall 's decline as a cold war symbol is only slightly awkward . His latest novel , The Russia House , fails , unsurprisingly , to anticipate the collapse of the East bloc , but it does deal credibly with the slipperiness of glasnost and the refusal of U.S. hard-liners to embrace perestroika . Deighton , on the other hand , is caught embarrassingly short . Spy Line , his new novel , puts him five books into a convoluted six- volume series that depends on East Germany 's walled-in villainy to sustain its gray and sunless menace . <P> The narrative 's first volume , Berlin Game , began with heavy irony , as Deighton 's hero Bernard Samson , a British agent watching for trouble at the Wall , asked his friend Werner Volkmann , " How long have we been sitting here ? " and Volkmann answered sourly , " Nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set in the present , starts off with a joke that might have been heard over coffee at a Tory think tank : " Glasnost is trying to escape over the Wall , and getting shot with a silenced machine gun ! " Its pivotal violence is a bloody shoot-out during an attempted escape along the autobahn from Berlin to the West . <P> That sort of crudeness , recent events seem to be saying , is no longer imaginable . Thus agent Samson , with his perfect , idiomatic Berliner Deutsch and his deep knowledge of levels of murk and treachery on both sides of the Wall , is suddenly out of date . As are , an optimist dutifully believes , many thousands of border guards , KGB head beaters and assassins in the real world . Espionage will go on , of course , but presumably it will be of the corporate kind , waged among Japan , Korea and the European Community , which is apt to include Czechoslovakia , Hungary , Poland , what used to be called East Germany , and ( as an associate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriller fans line up for tales of Samsung or Mitsubishi infiltrating Siemens A.G. and being foiled by plucky marketing execs ?
