If there is a single dominant factor motivating adult America ' s choice of beverages these days , it is a demand for flavor . While the total consumption of beer , wine , spirits and coffee continues to decline , high-quality products with distinctive personalities in each of these categories are steadily increasing their market share . ( I know limiting this discussion to " adult " beverages doesn ' t necessarily eliminate soft drinks , but for me it does . ) Our taste buds have been awakened , the theory goes , by travel and exposure to foods from other cultures . The swing to dining in restaurants , with their varied menus , styles and prices , has made comparing and passing judgment on food and drink virtually an everyday experience . In addition , competitive instincts have been fired by nearly three decades of nonstop conversation about diet and dining . When it comes to food and drink , we want the best of everything , even the best cup of coffee . All of which brings us to the current greening of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coffee " in a trio of new shops with the promise of another half-dozen opening here by year ' s end . Starbucks , a Seattle-based company that claims to be the nation ' s largest coffee retailer , has launched a full-scale invasion with the aim of " increasing coffee awareness " and winning converts to the full flavor that comes from rich coffee made from freshly roasted beans . " People drink coffee for three reasons , " Howard Schultz , the youthful , coffee-charged president of Starbucks , told me recently . " They drink for fuel in the morning , out of habit all day long or for flavor at selected times . The third reason is the one that brings people to Starbucks : They want something special . " The essence of specialty retailing , " he continued , " is to provide specialty service and specialized education . Our aim is to emotionalize the customer through the quality of our product . " The first step toward this goal , obviously , is to have a quality product to sell . The second is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very well-informed cheerleaders , then surrounds them with quality coffees , ancillary products and foods that justify their enthusiasm . Concise , informative pamphlets such as " Espresso , the True Story " and " Fresh Roasted , " a description of the firm ' s coffee selection , serve as teaching aids . All this missionary work is necessary , he is quick to add , because there are a good many areas of misconception about coffee . Among them : - Quality : There are two categories , robusta and arabica . Robusta , which is used in vacuum-pack , freeze-dried and instant coffees , is higher in yield , lower in cost and inferior in quality . The coffee beans at Starbucks , and almost anywhere else where beans are sold , are arabica. - Freshness : " About 90 percent of the coffee Americans consume is stale , " Schultz says . The beans , seeds that are found in pairs inside berries plucked from bushlike trees , have an " indefinite " shelf life until they are roasted . After a coffee bean is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of only two weeks . Ground coffee ' s life expectancy is even less . Storing coffee in the freezer will extend these deadlines somewhat , but those who want the very freshest flavor are advised to buy small amounts , buy often and grind their own beans at home just before brewing . " Our coffee is marginally more expensive , " Schultz acknowledges , " but we do our own roasting , ship direct and never sell beans more than eight days after they have been roasted. " - Roasting : Done at temperatures that can reach 900 degrees , this process brings the oils that produce coffee ' s distinctive smell and taste to the surface of the bean . The darker the roast , the fuller the flavor . Underroasted beans give an acidic taste to coffee . Overroasted but not yet burned beans make flabby-flavored , lifeless coffee whose taste may be compared to overripe fruit. - Espresso : An Italian cultural rite , involving preparing a single cup from freshly ground , darkly roasted powder in a special machine . The process should take about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely intense coffee . According to " Espresso , the True Story , " " The result should be nothing less than a pinnacle of coffee drinking . " Often , first-time consumers miss the nuances wondering what happened to the rest of the coffee . ( It ' s all there , just very concentrated . To increase the portion , add hot water. ) - Caffeine : Arabica beans contain only half the caffeine of most robusta beans , and you can safely bet there is less caffeine in your ominously dark cup of espresso than in a cup of regular supermarket coffee. - Brewing : " Making coffee in a percolator is absolutely the worst method I know , " Schultz says . " You can burn it . " He recommends various drip methods but insists that rather than have it sit in an electrically warmed open pot for even 20 minutes , it should be transferred to a Thermos . To begin the coffeemaking process , you might visit Starbuck ' s " whole bean store " at 617 W. Diversey Pkwy , which stocks coffeemakers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the cup are available there and at the chain ' s coffee bars at 219 W. Jackson Blvd. and 150 N. Wacker Dr. Sometime this month , if not already , new coffee bars are to open at two new locations , 676 N. St. Clair St. and the corner of Clark and Dickens Streets . Something that is missing at all these locations , however , is flavored coffees , an increasingly popular category . " We ' re a purist company , " Schultz said . " We don ' t want to diffuse the quality of our ground coffees by mixing in artificial flavorings . We just try to give you the best cup of coffee available anywhere . You can do what you want to it . " You might , for instance , want to drink it with a very good coffee- flavored dessert .
