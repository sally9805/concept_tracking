BRITAIN Likely Story The spy who changed his plea <P> In the murky world of international espionage , the explanation offered in London 's Old Bailey courtroom sounded plausible enough . Accused of passing North Atlantic Treaty Organization secrets to the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1961 , Hugh Hambleton , 60 , a Canadian university professor , asserted that he was actually operating as a double agent . The NATO papers he took had been doctored to mislead the Soviets , he said . Hambleton insisted that he was acting on the instructions of two control officers , a Frenchman and a Canadian , in an effort to infiltrate the KGB . <P> Hambleton did not stick to that story for long . Informed that the prosecution would produce French and Canadian intelligence officials to deny that he had been a double agent , Hambleton abruptly changed his plea last week to guilty . Sir David Croom-Johnson , the judge presiding over the seven-day trial , then addressed Hambleton : " It was a long time ago that you committed these acts . But they catch up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this court is that you go to prison for ten years . " Hambleton thus became the fifth person this year to be convicted of violating Britain 's Official Secrets Act .
