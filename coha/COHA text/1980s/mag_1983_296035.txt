THE MIDDLE AGES by A.R . Gurney Jr . <P> Three decades pass . Somewhere just offstage , things are happening : the personal pageantry of weddings , christenings , funerals ; social upheavals ranging from suburbanization to the sexual revolution . But only the echoes of change are heard in the trophy room of a venerable men 's club , the sole setting of The Middle Ages . In a time of ethnicity , the club remains a haven for an embattled Wasp old guard . For the younger generation that departs on a picaresque journey through the chaotic world outside , the club is a beacon , a symbol of the formative power of tradition even on those who would escape its sway . <P> The Middle Ages , like A.R . Gurney Jr . ' s other plays about the declining Protestant elite ( Scenes from American Life , the current off-Broadway hit The Dining Room ) , is a wistful , elegiac comedy that preserves a tight-lipped emotional reserve : confrontations that could be tragic are played for rueful laughter . Unlike most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a well-knit , symmetrical plot . It offers two love stories , a star-crossed one between a clownish boy and the girl who occasionally impels him to grow up , and another , almost accidental , between the boy 's father ( " My mother got so bored she died " ) and the girl 's divorced , social-climbing mother . The play is also a moving struggle for control and forgiveness between the autocratic father and his farcically self-destructive son . <P> The central character is the rebellious , goofy boy who becomes a college dropout , an AWOL sailor , a protesting scholar and a waiflike pornographer . He could be a mere shnook . But as shrewdly played by Jack Gilpin , he is a natural winner with a compulsion to foul up to prove his independence . Ann McDonough , in the unshowy part of the girl , is compelling in the play 's best moment : having married Gilpin 's conventional younger brother , she sees Gilpin come through the window in his sailor 's uniform to woo her away . She is all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is downstairs and realizes that Gilpin has bragged about this escapade to everyone he knows . Once again , the knight-errant has undertaken his quest not in chivalry but in folly . <P> As the boy 's father , Andr Gregory , veteran avant-garde director and recent film star ( My Dinner with Andr ) , gives a mannered and actorish performance that somehow works perfectly : he has exactly the fussy , studied quality of a paterfamilias of a bygone era . <P> Like the historical Middle Ages , the present era strikes Gurney as a time to conserve a dwindling heritage . His central character admires the medieval period as " a quiet , dull life punctuated by ceremony " That describes precisely the ordered , ancestor-worshiping existence of the families in The Middle Ages and , more broadly , of virtually all families . By the play 's end , Gurney 's rebel reconciles himself-and the audience-to the serene rewards of dull domesticity . <P>
