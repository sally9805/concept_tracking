The Reagan Administration was simply not up to the exquisite talents of David Stockman . In five years as Director of the Office of Management and Budget , he strode through the corridors of power thwarted , in his account , by political nincompoops who never grasped what policy was all about . He has hardly met another presidential aide he did not disdain . He labored unsuccessfully to educate a dotty President in the fundamentals of economics , only to have poor Ronald Reagan ignore " the palpable , relevant facts " and wander in circles . <P> In the end , the self-proclaimed White House intellectual , the Harvard divine , did not grasp the nature of the drama in which he played , and somewhere along his journey he misplaced his soul . <P> Stockman 's memoirs , The Triumph of Politics ( Harper &; Row ; $19.50 ) , form a singular document of arrogance . That Washington can not meet its responsibilities on the budget certainly is true , but Stockman 's own failures may have had as much to do with creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic planning with which we are now burdened . <P> Stockman 's narrative about Reagan and his aides is at times so unintelligible ( the President , he writes , " had no concrete program to dislocate and traumatize the here-and-now of American society " ) and so stunningly self-centered ( the Reagan revolution was not Reagan 's , " it was mine " ) that it provokes a bit of perverse admiration . Surely this is a hoax . The onetime boy wonder of the OMB has to be better than he reads . <P> Stockman 's anguished discoveries that Presidents sometimes do not understand the intricacies of Government and often do n't seem to know what they are talking about are hardly original . And Stockman still does not understand that the presidency is mostly political calculation mixed with a large portion of ballyhoo . <P> Reagan trusted Stockman , but Stockman , by his own admission , again and again failed to return that trust . The mystery in this account is why Stockman did not lay his fears of impending financial disaster squarely on the President 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intentions , he did not resign . His self-exoneration  --  describing how he was flitting here and there in righteous dismay , confronting all those mindless Californians around Reagan , struggling to " work from within " to avert the catastrophe he so clearly saw before him  --  does not go down well . He confesses to being too enamored of power . Yet he leaves no doubts that he considered his morality of a higher order , his intelligence superior . <P> Stockman contends that Reagan was not a revolutionary and should never have tried to change the U.S. Government dramatically . That 's an odd revelation . Anyone who spent four years as a Congressman should know that Presidents do not win power by planning to discard totally the American past . Ronald Reagan never suggested he intended to dismantle two centuries of American tradition . Nevertheless , the Reagan Administration has brought enough change to Washington to be called a revolution , at least in the patois of journalists .                   @ @
