For Easier Breathing Our regular readers know the sorrow we feel about the advanced em  --  physema strangulating my brother Joe ( page 58 ) . Air hunger can make one more miser  --  able than most pain . Dr. Henry Heimlich and Dr. Ed Patrick of Cincinnati set out to Iowa with me with the express purpose of be  --  ginning a research proj  --  ect with the Heimlich In  --  stitute Foundation  --  to create a new artificial lung to oxygenate blood for victims like Joe . Em  --  physema has left him with lungs functioning at only 5'o of normal . The veterans ' hospitals are filled with men like him who began smoking heavily during World War II and the Korean War . Before experimenting with the artificial lung , Dr. Heim  --  lich felt that a Micro-Trach should be inserted so Joe could get his oxygen through his trachea instead of through his nostrils with a nasal cannula . Dr. Heimlich explained that oxygen brought in through the nostrils is lost quickly when a patient tries to eat or speak . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead air space of the naso  --  pharynx makes the muscles work hard to pull the oxygen down into the lungs . The Micro-Track Dr. Heimlich developed is just now be A large group of surgeons , emergency respiratory therapists , and other medical personnel wanted to see Dr. Heimlich insert the Mkro-Trach . The procedure would not normally require this crowd . It is done in the outpatient department in some hospitals . tients who have received lung transplants are now playing tennis with each other . But Dr. Joel Cooper and his col  --  leagues at Toronto General have a waiting list of six people who have been hospitalized and must wait for surgery until donor lungs become available . More than one half of those selected for lung transplants die while waiting for donor lungs . Yet we bury good lungs every day in the United States and in Canada . Donor Number 317-636-8881 Sometimes it 's discouraging when we hit a dry spell on re  --  sponses concerning organ donors . We feel inclined to leave the donor number off our table of contents at times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priscilla Davis hits our desk , and we know we need to keep trying to let all our readers know about the need for spare " livers , hearts , lungs , kid  --  neys , and more . " This mother tells of her son 's liver trans  --  plant surgery and how she was helped by conversations with Charlotte Harkness ( SatEvePost , December ' 85 ) , who had just received her liver transplant at Mayo Clinic . Only a small injection of Xylocaine anesthetic was needed at the site to permit a needle to enter the trachea ( windpipe ) without discom  --  fort . An X-ray confirmed that the plastic tube had been properly placed . Joe 's X-ray also revealed a severe loss of lung tissue . Dear Dr. SerVaas : I want to thank you again for the article in the Post last December . 1 have often thought if I had n't seen that arti  --  cle , what would I have done when Mark got so bad in Jan  --  uary ? I had talked to a doctor at Mayo Clinic about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " downer " to me . After I talked with Charlotte Harkness I had such hope . Mark is doing wonderfully . It was five months ago late at night , or I should say the early morning hours , they did his transplant . He has never had any trouble to speak of . He has never had any signs of rejection , and we feel so blessed for this . He went into surgery weighing about 119 pounds , and now he tips the scales at 174 pounds . He looks and feels so good . The blood pressure is much better and all the fluid in the tummy is gone , and he is even off the low-sodium diet . He tells me every day is beautiful even if it is raining , in the middle of a dust storm , or the tempera  --  ture outside is 110 . Mark will be starting back to dental school in the lab in December and on the clinic floor with a patient load in The hook-up . The oxygen is still coming through the nasal can  --  nula taped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oxygen to the tiny plastic tube in his lower trachea . Joe had been getting 2 liters of oxygen per minute through the nasal cannula . After the Micro-Trach insertion , Dr. Heimlich gave Dr. Van Zee ( to his right ) and others who will take care of Joe a lesson about irrigating and replacing the Micro-Trach when necessary . He pre  --  dicted Joe would require only V2 liter of oxygen per minute . January . Most of the time he has been in dental school his hemoglobin has been 10 or below . Going into surgery it was 6 ? now it is O. The bile in the blood was 37.5 mgs percent going into surgery , and today it is .4 . So you can see school should be a breeze . He only has six quarters to go , and he will take the California state board and have his licenses . It will he a very proud day for us .

Please send the address of anyone we can assist with an  --  swering questions or anything . If you would like for me to contact them and send some before-and-after pictures of Mark and tell them exactly of our experiences at Mayo Clinic with their marvelous trans  --  plant team , I will be more than happy to . Just send names and addresses . So many people have a lot of fear built up in their minds , and it helps so much to talk to someone who has been there and had the surgery and the experience . I will be happy to write to anyone who needs encourage  --  ment or just wants to ask questions . I can be reached at ( 209 ) 665-4410 between noon and 9 p.m .

These tiny stalked growths occur on the neck and under the arms of many people . The polyp association suggests that those having skin tags have a high risk of having polyps in their colons . Colonic polyps are significant to your health . There is evidence that cancer of the bowel most often be  --  gins in polyps . The bottom line is : If you have skin tags on your neck or under your arms , it is doubly important to have your colon examined for polyps . Most colon polyps are removed painlessly during the examination and sent to the pathology lab . Polyp removal greatly reduces your chances for falling victim to colon cancer . With fiber op  --  tics equipment the gastroenterologist performing the colonoscopy can let you see your own polyp in the lining of your colon before he removes it . Radial Keratotomy This controversial procedure to correct myopia was de  --  veloped by a Russian ophthalmologist quite by accident . A young patient of his was struck in the eye while wearing glasses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anterior layers of the front of the eye . When the bandages were removed , the young boy , to his surprise , could see without his glasses . Thus the procedure known as radial keratotomy was de  --  veloped . Eight to 16 deep , penetrating cuts onto the cornea are made , like spokes on a wheel . The surgery reduces nearsightedness with an unpredictable outcome . Near  --  sightedness is the condition where the patient 's eye is too long or the front of the eye ( cornea ) is too steep ( curved ) . These patients can see nearby objects , although distant vi  --  sion is very blurred . The surgical procedure creates scars that shrink and make the front of the eye flatter , reducing The admiral fell better getting his oxygen through the Heimlich Micro-Trach in his lower larynx .

If the cornea flattens too much , the patient will become farsighted and in need of glasses . If the cornea does not flatten enough , the patient will be less nearsighted than before surgery . These patients may need to wear prescription lenses . At times the scars on the cor  --  nea prevent patients from wearing contact lenses . Some ophthalmologists feel that the long-term risks will not be known for another decade or two and that anyone who can achieve satisfactory vision with glasses or contact lenses would be wise at this time to continue with them . When Not to Cut Dear Dr. SerVaas : In his article " Cutting Your Medical Costs , " Marshall Loeb does a disservice to his readers when he portrays ophthalmologists as exotic and recommends optometrists for " routine eye exams . " The purpose of a regular eye exam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as glaucoma and ocular melanoma , and also recommend a change in spectacle prescription if necessary . In my ophthalmic prac  --  tice , these diseases are typically discovered in patients who are in the office for a regular exam . They may have perfect vision , no symptoms , and yet have serious eye disease . As with skin melanoma , early detection of ocular melanoma may be lifesaving . Unlike skin melanoma , patients can not see a brown spot within the eye or observe it for changes in color and size . Most readers are aware that a " glaucoma pressure test " should be performed by the ophthalmologist or optome trist during the routine exam . Yet few realize that this test may be normal , and the patient may still have undetected glaucoma . Ophthalmologists have extensive experience also in ex  --  amining the optic nerve , which may show glaucoma dam  --  age even when the " glaucoma test " gave a normal pressure reading .

T. Glendon Moody , M.D. Clinical Assistant Professor of Ophthalmology , University of Arizona Glaucoma You do n't feel a thing . After a while , you ca n't see a thing . It is believed that there are some one million unsus  --  pecting victims . That 's because you can be losing your sight to glaucoma and not realize it . Especially if you are 35 years or older , it 's a good idea to get your eyes tested yearly . If a relative has glaucoma , be sure to tell your oph  --  thalmologist . No More Back Blows After church last Sunday , I defaced a large 1977 American Heart Association poster that was hanging in the church basement where it is used for teaching Boy Scouts what to do for choking . I asked the minister first , mind you , and explained to the Rev. Bill Enright that the largest Presbyterian church in Indiana does n't want to be teaching bad in  --  formation about lethal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As I explained to the Rev. Enright , Surgeon General C. Everett Koop has proclaimed that back blows and chest thrusts used for treating choking are " hazardous , even lethal . " Dr. Koop wrote in the Journal of the American Medical Association as follows : " For years , medical opinion dif  --  fered on the best way or ways of dis  --  lodging an object from the back throat of a choking victim . Sharp blows to the back , finger sweeps of the throat , and manual thrusts to the chest were methods that were often recommended . However , at a confer  --  ence held July 11-13 , 1985 , to estab  --  lish first-aid standards for the Amer  --  ican Red Cross and the American Heart Association , the participants concluded that methods other than the Heimlich maneuver can be dan  --  gerous and that only the Heimlich maneuver should be used to treat a choking victim . " He further states : " The best rescue technique in any choking situation is the Heimlich ma  --  neuver . I urge the American Red Cross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who teach first aid to teach only the Heimlich maneuver . Manuals , posters , and other materials that recommend treating choking vic  --  tims with slaps and chest thrusts should be withdrawn from circula  --  tion . " Devised in the early 1970s by Hen  --  ry J. Heimlich , M.D. , who is now president of the Heimlich Institute at Xavier University , the Heimlich ma  --  neuver depends for its success on the fact that a choking victim has a large volume of air in his lungs , even if he was exhaling when the choking be  --  gan . If a rescuer presses sharply and repeatedly on the victim 's abdomen , with one balled fist wrapped in the opposite hand , at a point just above the navel , but below the rib cage and the diaphragm , that reservoir of air is expelled up the airway with a great deal of force , thus dislodging the obstruction from the victim 's throat . " It is of greatest importance that these obsolete charts now be removed and recalled , since deaths have been known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " says Dr. Ed Patrick , professor of electrical computer engineering at the Universi // ty of Cincinnati , " the back blows can cause the food bolus or other foreign object to lodge more firmly in the trachea , making death certain . " If your school or church still has old posters on its wall , please correct them by crossing out the now invalid infor  --  mation . Post readers have been given the correct Heimlich procedure for many years because Dr. Ed Patrick began his research at Purdue Universi  --  ty and proved more than ten years ago with animal experiments that back blows were wrong and the Heimlich maneuver was life-saving if done im  --  mediately . Just recently the Heimlich maneuver saved a choking dog . In drowning , Dr. Patrick believes the Heimlich maneuver should also be done to remove the water in the lungs before CPR is started . If you wish new charts to replace the obsolete ones and to teach proper procedure for choking and CPR , please write to The Children 's Better Health Institute , P.O.
