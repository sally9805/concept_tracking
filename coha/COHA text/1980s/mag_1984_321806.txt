How a coast-to-coast victory was forged <P> It was not exactly a total shutout . Walter Mondale did exhibit pockets of strength in the older , industrial cities , and he won among blacks , Jews and people earning less than $10,000 a year . But the true importance of the 1984 election was not simply Ronald Reagan 's overwhelming electoral total . It was the profound demographic shifts that helped account for his landslide . An analysis of the President 's virtually unprecedented avalanche of support shows that he swept not only every region of the country but every age group and almost every demographic voting bloc . Reagan captured most new voters as well as those for whom voting Democratic had been a lifelong tradition . He won most cities and towns , almost every suburb , and swamped his opponent in rural areas . Indeed , he won where few Republicans have ever won before . <P> The Northeast and industrial Midwest were supposed to form the geographic base for the liberal Democratic ticket . But exit polls there signaled a pattern that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voting groups he had to carry to defeat Reagan . <P> In New Jersey , blue-collar voters went for Reagan 57% to 43% , according to NBC 'S exit polls . In Pennsylvania , Reagan beat Mondale among voters ages 18 to 24 by 55% to 45% . Reagan won New York 's Italian vote by a stunning 63% to 37% , despite the presence of an Italian American from New York , Geraldine Ferraro , on the Democratic ticket .

Inspired in large part by Jesse Jackson 's oratory ( " Hands that picked cotton can now pick Presidents " ) , new black voters did register Democratic in record numbers . But the Republicans had added as many other new voters to their rolls and , in some states , more . In Florida , the Republicans outregistered the Democrats 450,000 to 225,000 . <P> The real story of the South was white flight from the Democratic Party . Southern whites voted for Reagan by 71% to 29% . Many Southerners continued to vote Democratic for state and local candidates , but they saw Mondale as a buttoned-up Northerner who had sold out to Big Labor .
