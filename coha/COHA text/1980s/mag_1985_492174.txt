lot of parents are not any more well-informed than I was . " Betty Ann Marsee 's voice was low and even while discussing a subject that has become dominant in her life . She is familiar with death in many forms . A registered nurse at the Valley View Hospital in Ada , Oklahoma , she knows about death personally as well as professionally . Her husband , Condly Marsee , died in 1982 ? but it was the death of her 19-year-old son , Marvin Sean , February 25 , 1984 , that led Mrs. Marsee to undertake a crusade which has already gained international notice . Sean was a bright , handsome teenager , a track star named the outstanding athlete of his high school in Talihina , Oklahoma , in 1983 . By the time he died , he had become a grotesque figure who scarcely appeared human . Cancer had destroyed his tongue , his throat and his jaw . Dr. Carl Hook , who tried vainly to save Sean 's life , attributed the cancer to the young man 's use of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by inhalation , has been around since the 17th century . Commonly used in the 18th century , snuff ( and later chewing or plug tobacco ) was the dominant form of tobacco in use in the United States until the 1860s , when pipe tobacco became more popular , only to be surpassed eventually by cigars and then cigarettes . By 1938 , cigarettes accounted for half of U.S. tobacco consumption and continued to outstrip other forms of tobacco use . But in rural America , snuff dipping and tobacco chewing continued , in part because of the danger of fire from cigarettes . And advertising by the tobacco industry has put a new emphasis on so-called " smokeless tobacco " since the federal government began requiring health warnings on cigarettes . Such requirements are not in effect for smokeless tobacco . The moist type of snuff Sean began using when he was 12 is placed in the mouth between the gums and the cheek . His mother said his brands were " Copenhagen " and " Skoal , " which carry no health warnings . " Several months before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he expressed the hope that he could travel around Oklahoma with Dr. Hook . He wanted to tell young people they should not use snuff and it definitely was bad , " Mrs. Marsee said . " A lot of parents are not any more well-informed than I was . While I had a gut feeling that if cigarettes were dangerous , then snuff lying next to a membrane would be dangerous , I had no definite proof that I could give him , " she said . " Teen-agers want proof . I had no absolute proof . " But elsewhere , such proof had been accumulating . In a 1979 study by Arden G. Christen , D.D.S. , 9 of 14 college athletes who chewed tobacco regularly had a noticeable leukoplakia , a white patch in the mouth often located where the tobacco touches the gum . Many doctors believe this is a pre-cancer condition . Overwhelming evidence of the health problems caused by snuff can also be found in India , where tobacco chewing is a widespread habit . Thirty to 40 percent of the population of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cancer is diagnosed as oral cancer . In a study of 10,000 people in India , 33 percent reported having used tobacco in some form . When the frequency of leukoplakia was calculated for those who smoked and chewed tobacco versus those who used no form of tobacco , the difference was striking . Leukoplakia was observed in 9.9 percent of those using tobacco and in 0.03 percent of those not using it . Another study of the incidence of oral cancer among 57,518 industrial workers in India found not one case of oral cancer in those who used no tobacco ; for the entire group , the rate of oral cancer was 25 out of 100,000 per year . After Sean 's death , Mrs. Marsee kept thinking about the crusade her son had wanted to wage . She began // looking for an attorney willing to be a David in filing a lawsuit against the tobacco-industry Goliath . She found that attorney in Dania DeschampsBraly . " I am as capitalist as you can get , " Mrs. Deschamps-Braly says . " But sometimes someone sits down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has to be something wrong . I would not have taken the case if I did n't think it had merits . " So the lawsuit to continue Sean 's crusade was filed in the Oklahoma Federal Court , Western District , against the U.S. Tobacco Company , the manufacturer of the snuff Sean had used . The $37 million product-liability suit charges the company with selling a " defective and unreasonably dangerous " product . Judge David L. Russell has set the case for trial on his November 1985 docket . The lawsuit has already attracted news-media interest . Business Week called attention to the case 13 days after it was filed . The Saturday Evening Post carried information about the lawsuit in its July/August 1985 issue . Mrs. Marsee has appeared on network TV programs , including " 60 Minutes " and " Hour Magazine , " and numerous other radio and TV programs . " The main purpose of our lawsuit is to acquaint children with the dangers of snuff , " Mrs. Mar-see said . " I 'd like to see a requirement for a health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities . I want to give the children proof that it is not good for them and let them make up their own minds . Let them be informed . " ( A similar thought was expressed by Surgeon General C. Everett Koop during a recent interview : " In some cities in this country , as many as 20 percent of high-school students are chewing some form of smokeless tobacco . We know that nationwide , the sales of moist snuff are mounting very rapidly . This is not covered by the same advertising ban that cigarettes are covered by . " Koop said he is concerned because advertisements for smokeless tobacco appeal to young people and use role models they admire . " I 'm particularly concerned that the advertisements 63 imply a health benefit when they say instead of a puff , reach for a chew , ' " he said . ) Indeed , smokeless tobacco is heavily advertised , and the advertisements are directed toward youth . Sports idols such as Terry Bradshaw , George Brett , Sparky Lyle and Walt Garrison extol the virtues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself " Pick of the Pros , " and the company has even developed an entire line of promotional accessories  --  patches , caps and shirts bearing the Red Man tobacco logo . At colleges nationwide , tobacco companies hand out or mail free samples to young people to " help get you started . " And in an advertisement titled " Walt Garrison answers your questions about moist smokeless tobacco , " Garrison explains to the novice : " Just take a small pinch in your thumb and forefinger and put it between your cheek and gum . Leave it there . No need to chew . The tobacco slowly releases its great flavor , giving you real satisfaction .... At first you could feel a slight irritation on the gum , and the tobacco may move around your mouth more than it should . . . . But learning is part of the fun , and these things take practice . Two weeks should make you a pro . " Sean was one of many high-school and even elementary-school youths who use " smokeless tobacco . " In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit while in high school , and 3 started in elementary school . Twelve of the 14 admitted that peer pressure was the most important factor in getting them started . A football player said that his high school had an official " High-School Snuff-Dipping Team , " and another said that in his hometown a worn , bleached ring outline , the size and shape of a snuff can , on the back pocket of jeans is regarded as a symbol of maturity . Mrs. Marsee said that in her home cigarettes had been an accepted part of relaxation . " I smoked a pack a week , but when Sean asked me to stop , I did , " she recalled of that period when his oral cancer was diagnosed . " Tobacco is an addiction , and I found it difficult to stop . But I did . " She believes Sean 's death has already made some young people stop and think about the use of smokeless tobacco . " We have had some children who told me they quit , and quite a few letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has come with the help of the Oklahoma legislature , which has enacted a law that includes snuff with other tobacco products that can not be sold to a minor . " This legislation is directly because of the Sean Marsee case , " said Mrs. Deschamps-Braly . The bill , championed by Sen. Billie Floyd , will become effective on November 1 , 1985 . " I am honored to be able to carry this bill , because I think it will help to make the public aware of the dangers of smokeless tobacco , " said Senator Floyd . " I have taught health and physical education at the university East Central University in Ada , Oklahoma and have been op-posed all along to the use of tobacco products , " she continued . " I have been concerned , even before the Sean Marsee case was publicized , about the use of smokeless tobacco by athletes . In our part of the country , smokeless tobacco is commonly used . Why , now tobacco companies are including little prepackaged pinches of snuff called ' bandits ' in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids are coming home with packets of snuff that they 've bought at mom-and-pop groceries during lunch . This bill will eliminate the purchase of snuff by grade-school children , and I think that as we discover more and more harmful results from using smokeless tobacco , people will be educated and stop using it . " Mrs. Deschamps-Braly has " gone international " to locate experts who have agreed to testify about the devastating effects of smokeless tobacco . continued from page 65 caller , who announced he was taking a survey , questioned her about who should be held responsible when teenagers use alcohol , salt , sugar , butter , shortening or saffron with damaging results to health . Then the caller asked whether she thought that tobacco companies should be regarded as responsible if an 11-year-old boy started using snuff . When the Ada resident disclosed her personal knowledge of the Marsee case , the questioner said he thought he was calling Oklahoma City , not Ada , and hung up . Betty Marsee is making sure that Sean 's memory is kept alive  --  for in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that other children may be saved from the life-threatening dangers of snuff .
