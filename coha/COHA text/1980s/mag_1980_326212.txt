Not necessarily , says a doctor , after studying five deaths <P> They are now in their final frenetic weeks of training , crisscrossing city streets and country lanes , eating special foods , subjecting their bodies to all manner of special exercises . The object of all this self-inflicted agony is the Oct. 26 New York City Marathon , when 16,000 runners will try to pound out 26.2 miles ( 42.2 km ) in the world 's largest long-distance race . Few will be able to match stride with the likes of Four-Time Winner Bill Rodgers . But for many competitors , just finishing is its own special victory : they are convinced that long-distance running protects them from heart disease . <P> This magic pill theory has long been popular in the running community , particularly among middle-aged males , a group that is at especially high coronary risk . The theory 's most outspoken advocate is Dr. Thomas Bassler , an Inglewood , Calif. , pathologist . Dr. William C. Roberts , chief of the pathology branch of the National Heart , Lung and Blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bassler is wrong . They studied the cases of five middle-aged men , 40 to 53 , who died while running , including Maryland Congressman Goodloe Byron , a six-time Boston Marathon finisher . <P> Roberts found that the men had been running for as long as ten years , averaging from 13.5 to 107 miles ( 22 to 173 km ) a week ; only one had ever complained of chest pains . Yet post-mortems revealed severe atherosclerosis-the buildup of plaque , or fatty deposits-in the major coronary arteries . Thus , concludes Roberts , heart disease was " the major killer . " <P> Roberts cautiously avoids drawing broader conclusions . He says that no one can say for sure if the men died because of running ; on the contrary , they might have died anyway . In fact , he adds , their running may have had some beneficial effects : " I suspect they would have died earlier than they did if they had n't run . " <P> There is evidence to support such optimism . Studies have shown that running-indeed , all strenuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called high-density lipoprotein ( HDL ) . This substance helps remove other , more harmful types of cholesterol from the body and presumably reduces the chances of such materials building up in the arteries . Studying 218 marathoners , joggers and nonrunners , G. Harley Hartung of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston found that the marathoners had the highest level of HDL . Other factors may be at work ; marathoners tend to be relaxed , eat healthful foods , not smoke and stay thin . <P> There is still another factor to keep runners off stride . Cornell 's Dr. Thomas Pickering , who has also studied HDL levels , reports that arrhythmias-abnormal heartbeat rhythms-occur more frequently during exercise and thus may be the cause of many unexplained deaths among runners . Says he : " A case could be made that the marathon runner is at a decreased risk of cardiovascular death when he is not running , but at an increased risk when he is . " So what is a runner to do ? Not to worry , says Roberts , who runs five to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I think that the purpose of running is to make a person feel better . " In other words , running a marathon must be its own reward .
