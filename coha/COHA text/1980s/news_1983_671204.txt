He was wrong . The gestation stretched out to five years , but the original blueprint apparently was sound . Now in its third year on the market , Mr. Smith ' s Micro-Tax is a best seller among dozens of taxprocessing disks available for personal computers. // " It ' s very seldom when you have several thousand users out there who think what you ' ve done is the best , " the bearded Mr. Smith said , smiling proudly . " And that ' s fun . " <> <> Jump in Shipments // Microcomputer Taxsystems Inc. , the company Mr. Smith owns and operates with his wife , Marilynne , and Greg Morrison , a certified public accountant , expects to ship about 6 , 000 Micro-Tax units of varying complexity during the 1982 tax filing season , up from 250 two years ago . Mrs. Smith said that the myriad changes in Federal tax laws in 1981 and 1982 had helped to spur sales. // Prices range from $195 for the disk with 14 tax schedules needed by individuals processing Federal returns only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than 40 schedules required by accountants and other tax-filing advisers to complete both Federal and state returns for dozens of clients. // Most purchases , averaging about $1 , 000 , come from small- and medium-sized accounting firms and other professional tax preparers . That puts Microcomputer Tax ' s annual sales close to $6 million. // The company is not required to disclose earnings , but it is already highly profitable and has been courted by several venture capital concerns , according to Mr. Morrison . The salaries of the three principals are well into six figures , he added . <> <> Five Years of Tinkering // Put another way , Microcomputer Tax is cashing in on Mr. Smith ' s five years of monastic tinkering . During that time , he transformed the Smiths ' s five-bedroom home in suburban Woodland Hills , 22 miles west of downtown Los Angeles , into a laboratory cluttered with the latest in personal computers and disk-programming paraphernalia. // The company ' s biggest expense is advertising , which runs more than 10 percent of sales , according to Mr. Morrison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including the eight-inch Micro-Tax disk , which runs on 15 different brands of personal computers , and a thick binder detailing operating instructions , cost the company less than $20 for each order. // To Mr. Smith , who has M.B.A. and Ph . D. degrees from the management school at the University of California at Los Angeles , the heart of his creation is its table system , which allows for quick changes in the program . <> <> Tax Laws Require Changes // That was crucial , he said , because some aspects of the tax laws are not available from the Internal Revenue Service until late December . Accountants need the disk by the end of January , so the program had to be easy to change. // After the years of long hours designing Micro-Tax , Mr. Smith says he has little worry of a competitor copying his system , selling it for less and diverting the riches that have begun to flow his way. // " I ' ve got 10 years of experience in this , " he asserted . " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a computer programmer . There are probably 500 guys in this country who could do it , but they are working on their own projects . We really don ' t have any competition. " // There are , however , other rapidly growing companies in the field , such as CPAids Inc. , in Kent , Ohio , and Howard Software Inc. of La Jolla , Calif . <> <> Computer Service Bureaus // Microcomputer Tax so far has been able to justify its prices by pointing to the higher fees charged by computer service bureaus to process tax returns for C.P.A. ' s and other tax advisers. // Professional tax preparers with dozens of business and individual clients , including most of the so-called Big Eight accounting firms , typically have mailed tax forms to service bureaus , such as Computax and Fast-Tax . The bureaus , in turn , derive the tax payment or refund after running the numbers through a central computer and mail completed forms back to the tax advisers. // But with personal computers being used now by more accounting offices , the market for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preparers of multiple tax forms . Micromputer Tax expects individuals eventually will overtake accountants and financial planners as the biggest sector of the market. // Others are not so sure . Carl Heintz , head of a C.P.A. firm in Glendale , Calif. , who has used personal computers in his business for several years , said that " no matter how sophisticated the program , there is still a lot the accountant must do in organizing the data and knowing how to present it within the return . " <> <> Prospects of Lower Costs // For now , the prospects of lower costs are alerting some accountants to the attributes of Micromputer Tax and its rivals . These accountants typically pay about $50 a filing for service bureau processing. // That is about twice the cost of buying an International Business Machines Corporation personal computer and a Micro-Tax program and then paying a clerk to type in the appropriate numbers , Mr. Morrison said. // Michael H. Quirke , an accountant who sells computer programs to accountants and businesses through his company , Houston Software Inc. , said Micro-Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work more thoughtfully on their clients ' tax returns . <> <> Some Holding Back // Some firms have held back for a variety of reasons . Many accountants over age 50 privately despair of adapting to computers , Mr. Quirke said . And some partners said they were not happy with delays caused by slow printers available for personal computers , he added. // That is not a problem as yet for Microcomputer Tax . At 50 orders a day , its 17-member staff is swamped with orders and telephone inquiries from customers whose problems range from activitating their computer to arcane points on the 1982 tax laws. // Mr. Morrison , 35 years old , was a manager at Peat , Marwick , Mitchell &; Co. before joining Microcomputer Tax as chief financial officer last July . He fields many of the tax questions ; Mr. Smith takes the technical issues . Some employees work 12-hour days , seven days a week. // Mrs. Smith , 36 , is the company ' s president . Mr. Smith , 43 , is executive vice president and head of research . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the San Fernando Valley , where he was a professor in operations research and she was an assistant in the dean ' s office . Mrs. Smith quit her job as an assistant dean at Southwestern Law School in Los Angeles when she and her husband formed Microcomputer Tax in 1980. // " Jerry said we could run the business six months a year and go sailing six months a year once the program was ready , " Mrs. Smith remarked blithely . " Boy , did I fall for that line. " //
