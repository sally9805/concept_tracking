General Jaruzelski ' s speech drew close attention because it came a day after a senior Government minister proposed talks with " all social groups " to end the national crisis . People familiar with the proposal said an offer to take part was conveyed to representatives of the Solidarity trade union , which has been banned since 1981. // Speaking openly for the first time since a wave of strikes burst upon Poland 12 days ago , General Jaruzelski told the Central Committee of the Communist Party that solving Poland ' s problems " demands the courage to break with old stereotypes and barriers , the courage to use new and unconventional means , and , first of all , effective ones . " Parts of the general ' s speech were televised. // // Economic Shortcomings // The original purpose of the party meeting was to revise the Government ' s economic policies and possibly to reshuffle the Government . Poland ' s leaders have been cast as villains and have been held responsible for the nation ' s economic ills. // But much attention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer , Jozef Czyrek , that elaborated on the idea that broad discussions of the nation ' s social and economic ills should be held among Poland ' s factions. // People familiar with details of the idea , which was put forth on Friday by the Interior Minister , Gen. Czeslaw Ki-szczak , said the hope was for representatives of Solidarity to be included in any talks , although details remained to be worked out on the negotiating teams and on the subjects for discussion. // Those people said the proposal was conveyed to the Solidarity founder , Lech Walesa , by a prominent Roman Catholic intellectual , Andrzej Stelmachowski , who has been acting as a go-between with the Communist authorities. // Early Saturday , Mr. Walesa left the Gdansk Shipyard , where he has been holding out with striking workers since last Monday , and , after a visit to his home , met with the Bishop of Gdansk , Tadeusz Goclowski , who played an important role in mediating an end to the 15 days of strikes at steel mills and shipyards in April and May. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " If the shipyard workers say so , then possibly , yes . Important is not who , but what. " // " We believe it is a step in the right direction , " he said . <> <> Enigmatic Reply // Mr. Walesa gave an enigmatic reply when asked whether his departure from the shipyard was related to the proposed talks . " In practicality , no , " he said . " But everything in this country is in some way connected. " // At the Central Committee session , General Jaruzelski broke his silence on the strikes , saying , " The situation is complex , but not for a moment did we lose control. " // In what appeared to be a defense of the use of police force to end some of the strikes , which have virtually halted production in Poland ' s crucial coal-mining region , the Polish leader said , " We react and will react according to the conditions and needs. " // " The security and stability of the Polish socialist state can not and will not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of the ruling Politburo. // The party meeting opened as workers demanding the return of Solidarity , as well as higher wages , remained on strike at three coal mines in Silesia , at a steel mill in Stalowa Wola , in southeastern Poland , and in the ports of Gdansk and Szczecin. // General Jaruzelski called for an investigation of the " delays and negligence , and the arrogance and soullessness , " that he said caused the strikes. // Diplomats and other observers said the talks , while the direct attacks on official policy appeared to precede a Government reshuffling , including possibly the dismissal of the Prime Minister , Zbigniew Messner , who would be made to bear the burden of the economic failings . <> <> ' Mistaken Economic Policy ' // Wladyslaw Baka , the former head of the Central Bank , who took over in June as the Central Committee official responsible for the economy , said the " source of the current difficulties is the mistaken economic policy , " and he urged tough measures , including a wage and price freeze , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soaring inflation. // But the idea of wide-ranging talks was pushed forward at the session in the report by Mr. Czyrek , who appeared to refer to General Kiszczack ' s proposal when he said the idea for such talks might be to develop a " platform of agreement in matters of utmost importance for the nation. " // " One could ponder the idea of creating a council of national agreement to work out this platform , " he said . He said it might include changes in the electoral law ; the revival of Poland ' s second parliamentary chamber , which was suppresed after a 1947 referendum ; and the creation of an office of President of the Republic. // Such proposals were similar to existing arrangements introduced by General Jaruzelski after martial law was declared in 1981 and then suspended in 1983 . The general ' s ideas for discussion groups are supposed to have involved broad segments of society in decision making . But most of the groups have degenerated into debating clubs , with little real influence on policy. // Mr. Czyrek , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , defined what he described as the " socialist pluralism " of Polish society , which he said meant " respecting the political consequences of the diversity of interests , views and orientations in our society . " But he said the Communist Party " will not agree with confrontational pluralism. " // Such remarks were taken by members of the opposition as referring to its wish to have an independent voice in any discussion of the nation ' s future . <> <> No ' Conflict ' Sought // " No one in Solidarity tends to exercise what Secretary Czyrek calls confrontational pluralism , " said Adam Michnik , a leading dissident who is a spokesman for Solidarity . " It is not our intention to use the issue of union pluralism to initiate conflict. " // But Mr. Michnik called the Government ' s offer " the first perhaps real step of the authorities to seek a resolution of a comprehensive character and an agreement with Solidarity. " // " We paid particular attention to the formulation , " he said , adding that there were " no preconditions. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
