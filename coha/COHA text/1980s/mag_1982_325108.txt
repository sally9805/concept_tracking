For this week 's cover story on the nation 's troubled Social Security system , TIME 's correspondents uncovered almost universal agreement on one point : the initial experience of obtaining a Social Security number can be a real bench mark in life . This finding applied to our own correspondents . " I first got my Social Security card at 16 in Chicago , " says Atlanta Bureau Chief Joe Boyce . " Little did I know then that I was entering into a lifelong relationship with federal , state and local bureaucracy . " Recalls Senior Correspondent Ruth Mehrtens Galvin : " I well remember when I received my Social Security card . It still bears the name of my employer at the time . And it is one of the few things I have never lost . " Says Washington Correspondent Hays Gorey : " It was obtained so long ago I would have to resort to carbon dating to determine when . But I have never forgotten the number . " Says Boston Reporter Lisa Towle : " I recall the day my sixth-grade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to apply for Social Security cards . I felt so proud , though still not understanding the significance . " <P> TIME 's correspondents around the country found that the very issue of Social Security quickly touched personal sensitivities of all kinds . " When everybody 's standard of living is shrinking , " says Reporter-Researcher Denise Worrell , " how can you choose between your own paycheck and your grandfather 's Social Security payment ? " Says Washington Correspondent Jeanne Saddler , who interviewed top Administration officials , including Commissioner of Social Security John A. Svahn : " Most people have never understood how the system works . The dilemma the Government faces is finding a way to keep the commitments it has made to the people . " Neil MacNeil , who has covered Congress for TIME for 24 years , remembers all too well the way Congressmen used to brag about how they once honored those commitments . But political cynicism aside , TIME 's correspondents had all the help they needed to put this important story about human needs and governmental inadequacies in focus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reporter Cheryl Crooks , " the issue drew impassioned responses from those interviewed . Some were frightened , many were confused , but no one declined to comment . "
