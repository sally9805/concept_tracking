The program , the American Heart ' s Food Festival , will be held the week of Sept. 8 , with similar events planned for the second week in September every year. // " Public awareness about cholesterol and its relationship to heart disease is high , " Dr. J. Hurley Myers , a physiologist at Southern Illinois University , told a news conference at the Barbizon Plaza Hotel yesterday . " Unfortunately , that awareness is not being translated into appropriate shopping behavior. " // Heralded by the slogan " It ' s high time to lower cholesterol , " the program ' s goal is to increase consumer knowledge at the point of purchase so that better food choices can be made , Dr. Myers said . With 8 , 000 markets participating - 5 national chains ( including A. &; P. stores in the New York area ) and more than 60 regional stores , the heart association hopes to reach 92 million shoppers. // Depending on the store , shoppers may be greeted by a nutritionist who will conduct a heart-healthy shopping tour ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that influence cholesterol levels in the blood ; by guidance on cooking with little or no fat , and by recipes for preparing nutritious meals from scratch . Throughout the campaign the emphasis will be on using ordinary foods but preparing them differently and perhaps serving different quantities. // Dr. Antonio M. Gotto Jr. , the heart association ' s immediate past president , said the organization ' s educational efforts during the last 25 years have contributed to a decrease in consumption of heart-damaging foods , notably saturated animal fats like butter , lard and egg yolks , and a concomitant increase in the consumption of heart-protecting polyunsaturated oils. // " These changes overall have resulted in a significant decline in average blood cholesterol levels and , in turn , are a contributing factor to the decreased death rate from cardiovascular diseases of 30 percent in the last 11 years , " Dr. Gotto said . " However , there is still a long way to go . Cardiovascular diseases account for more than half the deaths in this country and more than 92 million Americans have cholesterol levels above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing heart disease. // According to Maudene Nelson , a nutritionist at Columbia University , " The grocery store is one of the best places to convey nutrition information because consumers can put their new awareness to work right away . " She said the recommended foods are readily available in local supermarkets and easy to prepare. // The main principles of the program , the nutritionist said , include variety and flexibility in meal planning ; smaller portions of meats and other fatty foods ; more generous servings of grains , fruits and vegetables ; learning to shop with a list ( for better planning and less impulse buying ) ; use of more basic ingredients and making foods from scratch instead of depending on prepared foods , many of which contain hidden , harmful fats ; cooking in nonstick pans ; trimming off all visible fat before cooking , and replacing butter and other hard fats with margarines made from liquid vegetable oil. se Five-Minute Soup #4 cups chicken broth Half a cucumber , scrubbed and sliced very thin but not peeled #4 raw mushrooms , sliced #2 cups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) #1 tomato , cubed 1/2 cup lean meat , cooked and shredded. // Heat broth .

Visible fat is trimmed from all meats before they are cooked and , when possible , after they are cooked . The skin is removed from chicken. // * Seasonings , such as garlic and lemon juice , replace cream sauces. // * Low-fat or skim milk is used instead of whole milk. // * Low-fat yogurt is used instead of sour cream. // * Egg whites are substituted for whole eggs in recipes calling for one to three eggs . ( The ratio is two egg whites for each whole egg. ) // * Margarine replaces butter and in some circumstances is used in reduced amounts - when it is spread on bread , for example. // * Fresh fruits and vegetables are used in abundance. // * Most dishes are made from scratch. **22;2466; <> **42;2490; **42;2534; **42;2578; <> **76;2622; <> r , m &; MONDAY <> **28;2700; TUESDAY <> **28;2730; WEDNESDAY <> **28;2760; <> <> <> <> **22;2790; <> **42;2814; **42;2858; **42;2902; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <> <> Beef-lamb pitas with cucumber and yogurt dip <> <> <> <> Fresh vegetable salad <> <> <> <> Lemon sherbet <> <> <> <> <> Crispy baked chicken <> <> <> <> Scalloped potatoes <> <> <> <> Sliced tomatoes with basil <> <> <> <> Green beans with mushrooms <> <> <> <> Deep-dish fruit pie <> <> <> <> <> Beef stew <> <> <> <> Cornmeal-whole- wheat muffins <> <> <> <> Coleslaw <> <> <> <> Fruit cup with vanilla yogurt <> <> <> <> Oatmeal-raisin cookies* <> <> <> <> <> <> **20;3024; <> **42;3046; **42;3090; <> **76;3134; <> r , m &; THURSDAY <> **28;3212; FRIDAY <> **28;3242; Indexer### ###O850828000C0081### <> <> <> <> **20;3272; <> **42;3294; **42;3338; <> **76;3382; <> <> <> <> <> **20;3460; <> **42;3482; **42;3526; <> **76;3570; <> FULL of fleeting days of sun , a friend sighs at the ads for the county fair when the end of August looms .
