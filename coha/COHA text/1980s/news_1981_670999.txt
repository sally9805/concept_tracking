Church groups and lawyers seeking the release of the Haitians have found sponsoring families willing to take responsibility for them , and they criticize the Government ' s decision to detain them. // " I don ' t know of any parallel where people coming to the United States for asylum have been treated so harshly , have been detained as a group when sponsors are available , " said Ira Gollobin , a lawyer representing the National Council of Churches in behalf of the Haitians . <> <> Goal Is to Reduce Influx // Until recently , " boat people " arriving without visas have been released into the community and given work permits while waiting for action on their asylum claims . But last month , as part of a program to reduce the influx of illegal aliens , Attorney General William French Smith recommended that " the Administration detain rather than release illegals pending exclusion hearings. " // Among hundreds of boat people who fled Haiti over a period of time , and were detained in a Federal camp near Miami , the 83 Haitians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing to house and care for them have been found by the National Council of Churches , the United States Catholic Conference and the Lawyers Committee for International Human Rights . Earlier this month , lawyers delivered by hand to the New York District office of the Immigration Service written requests for the Haitians ' release. // Charles Sava , director of the district office , said that the requests were being handled by his staff and that he did not know when any decisions would be made . He said the Haitians should not be called " refugees " because they were illegal aliens who had entered the United States without documentation. <> <> 1958 Supreme Court Ruling // Lawyers acting for the Haitians cite a 1958 ruling in which the United States Supreme Court held that detention of aliens seeking asylum was " the exception , not the rule , and is generally employed only as to security risks or those likely to abscond . " Such a policy , Justice Tom C. Clark wrote in the majority opinion , " reflects the humane qualities of an enlightened civilization. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for International Human Rights , who is coordinating the efforts of the volunteer lawyers for the Haitians , called the physical detention " an example of the new get-tough policy toward refugees , to discourage others from coming. " // Mr. Gollobin said that tens of thousands of refugees , including Colombians , Cubans and the Nicaraguans who fled after the 1979 Sandanist victory , had customarily been released into the community unless they had criminal records . A spokesman for the Justice Department , Tom Stewart , said yesterday that the detention policy was " discretionary " and that " at this moment " it was only being applied to Haitians. // Besides the 83 Haitians in Brooklyn , 40 are being held at the Federal prison at the former Olympic Village in Lake Placid , N.Y. , and others are in Federal correctional facilities in West Virginia and Texas . <> <> A Broken Television Set // The 49 Haitian men and 34 women in Brooklyn sleep in bunk beds along the walls of narrow cell blocks behind black iron bars . For each group , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vending machines behind a metal fence and a broken television set. // " There ' s nothing for these people to do , " said Leonard Gordon , the chief detention officer at the Brooklyn center . The primary staples are small amounts of rice and beans , with chicken on Sunday , the Haitians said . When asked what they were fed , one group of refugees , speaking Creole patois among themselves , said finally through their interpreter , " Leaves. " // It was the only word they could find to describe vegetables that are alien to their diet . The primary problem with the meals , Mr. Gordon said , is that the Haitians are not accustomed to the type of food . <> <> Many Were Farmers // For the Haitians , most of whom are in their 20 ' s and 30 ' s , the fact of confinement is the main source of anguish . Many were farmers in Haiti . Now , they are not allowed to go outdoors. // One 23-year-old former farmer , who has a relative living in Brooklyn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched to reach the high windows that open only partially . After more than a month ' s incarceration the brightness now gives him headaches , he said. // Last year , the New York Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit to close the Brooklyn detention center on the grounds that it was " too decrepit , too old and too filthy , " said Richard Emery , a lawyer handling the suit . Mr. Emery said conditions at the facility had since improved , but that it was still " uninhabitable , even by criminals , which these people are not. " // The Brooklyn facility " meets the guidelines for short-term detention facilities , " said Mr. Sava , the district director . " Beyond that I have no comment . " <> <> Not Considered Dangerous // The Haitians being held in Brooklyn are " not considered dangerous , " Mr. Gordon , the facility ' s chief detention officer , said at the facility this week . " Maybe one out of a hundred " will cause problems , he said. // Holding the Haitians in prison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pursuing their asylum claims , Mr. Posner of the lawyers ' committee said . Often in the past , even those who fled Haiti for economic reasons were considered to be anti-Government and consequently imprisoned upon their return . But despite fear of what would happen to them , some of the Haitians are talking about going back to Haiti to escape their confinement in the United States. // Church leaders and lawyers are to meet with Mr. Sava next week to discuss again the possibilities of the Haitians being released to the community. // " Leaving aside humanitarianism , why should Government funds be spent at a time that we ' re talking about budget cuts , when these people have sponsors , " said Mr. Gollobin , the lawyer for the National Council of Churches. // If they are unsuccessful in obtaining the Haitians ' release , Mr. Posner said , the groups are considering filing a lawsuit. //
