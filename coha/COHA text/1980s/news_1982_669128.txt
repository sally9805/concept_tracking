In 1978 Congress had directed that this natural area , not yet swallowed up by southern California ' s urban sprawl , somehow be welded into the national park system . A combination of land purchases and protection agreements would be the means . The hoped-for result : a new park , the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area , embracing both publicly and privately owned lands. // But in 1981 the effort was suddenly cast into limbo . The newly appointed secretary of the interior , James G. Watt , clamped a freeze on all National Park Service land acquisition funds . The new secretary also stated publicly : ' ' I do not believe the national park system should run urban parks. ' ' // For superintendent Chandler , the freezing of acquisition funds put a roadblock in the way of purchasing several key parcels of land needed to hold the new park together . His public defense of the park and criticism of Watt ' s action as short-sighted brought a verbal reprimand from Washington . Meanwhile , morale at the park reached rock bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national offices . ' ' It ' s like we don ' t exist , ' ' said one. // Today the gloom has lifted . Chandler is optimistic that Santa Monica Mountains will not only survive but will come to be regarded as one of the outstanding units of the national park system . Santa Monica received $6 million when Congress overruled Watt ' s total moratorium on land acquisition and restored part of the 1981 appropriation Watt had cut off . By spring of 1982 , Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area was a viable , though far from complete , part of the national park system . It had an expert staff working to protect its resources , and rangers helping to provide recreational opportunities for increasing numbers of visitors . The small portion of the area now owned by the Park Service recorded more than 395 , 000 visits last year , not counting the 7 million people who pass through the area or the 29 million who use the state beaches and other public areas of the new park . Even Secretary Watt appeared to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he supported funding to complete the acquisition of lands for the Santa Monica area , Watt replied , ' ' Yes , but not now. ' ' // Over the past 20 years , developers and real estate interests have relentlessly promoted unlimited urbanization of this area . But conservation groups and public-spirited citizens have worked to protect , within the national park system , what was left of the Santa Monica Mountains ' natural value . The result is a tenuous , albeit effective , series of working arrangements between the Park Service and the other public and private owners of the land . These give a measure of protection to the nation ' s largest , relatively undisturbed example of a coastal Mediterranean ecosystem. // On a map , the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area looks like a heavily gerrymandered political district . Its borders abound with bulges and narrow strips that exclude populated areas . From Point Mugu State Park on the west , running east along the entire mountain range for 47 miles , to the Hollywood Freeway , the park includes rugged 3 , 000-foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sage , and wildflowers , 44 miles of beaches , canyons of dry , golden grasses dotted with 400-year-old California live oaks and valley oaks , and streams lined with willows and sycamores . Bobcats , deer , coyotes , and a few mountain lions are among the 60 species of mammals in the area . Some 240 kinds of birds populate the park , and one area , Cheeseboro Canyon , is reported to have the largest number of nesting sites for birds of prey , per acre , in the country . <> <> Many local residents favor preservation // The existence of so much natural land in the midst of 10. 5 million people is due partly to action taken by local voters . Over a number of years they set aside many state , county , and city parks and water district lands . Other key factors in preserving the natural quality of the land : the large numbers of private camps and recreational facilities in the area ; an ownership pattern in western Los Angeles County dominated by large private ranches ; the topography , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some areas . And , fortunately , most of the people who have purchased tracts in the area have maintained the land ' s natural features , and have become advocates of preservation. // Establishing the new park has required all the negotiating and planning skills that Chandler , a 23-year Park Service veteran , could muster . Starting from scratch 31/2 years ago , he first had to acquire enough land to form a nucleus of Park Service ownership . At the same time , he had to work out cooperative arrangements for managing private lands in ways compatible with the purposes of the national recreation area . Natural resources had to be protected from the threats within and adjacent to the park . Recreation opportunities had to be developed . And all of this in a period of budget austerity throughout the National Park Service. // Chandler has been able to purchase only 6 , 000 acres of the 43 , 000 sought in the original plan . The land cost $37 million , and the figure would have been even higher had not several tracts been donated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saved the park more than $2 million by taking an option on 1 , 800 acres in Cheeseboro Canyon and holding it until the park had the money to buy it at a bargain price. // With land prices escalating , the Park Service estimates it may now cost four times the orginally authorized $155 million to make all of the planned acquisitions . ' ' When some people question whether we can have a viable recreation area for $155 million , my response is that we can , by relying more heavily on less-than-fee acquisition , and by depending on donations and good land-use planning by local agencies to preserve a lot of what we have , ' ' says Chandler . ' ' But we still need to acquire some of the most sensitive resource areas and some sites needed for recreation activities . The principal thing is to preserve the character of the mountains without acquiring everything , ' ' he adds . <> <> Report specified over 50 threats to the park // No matter how much land can ultimately be purchased , Chandler faces an ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ values . With Greater Los Angeles pressing in and 40 , 000 people living within park borders , it is little wonder that the staff identified 53 distinct threats in the Park Service ' s 1980 State of the Parks Report . That was the fifth highest total among the 333 Park Service units . Air and water pollution , toxic chemicals , noise , threats to wildlife , destruction of habitat , livestock grazing , wildland fires , land development , roads , vandalism , and erosion lead the list . Projected oil leasing could also harm the park. // With an eye to these threats , Chandler has put more permanent resource managers on his staff than rangers . He recruited Dave Ochsner , formerly chief resource manager of Grand Canyon , to head the staff . Paul Rose , an expert hydrologist from Everglades National Park , directs the monitoring and gathering of basic data about the park ' s natural resources . Bob Plantrich , a forester and controlled-burning expert from Sequoia , and Kheryn Klubniken , a marine biologist specializing in environmental pollution compliance , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the park has already developed a more complete inventory of plants and wildlife , including data on their condition , than Yellowstone has gathered in its 110 years . This information is being computerized to make it easier for park officials to detect dangers to resources . With the help of the US Geological Survey , the park has launched a program to monitor water quality and quantity in the 10 watersheds of the Santa Monica range. // Brush fires are a recurrent threat . So Chandler and his resource managers have had to sell local citizens on the need for controlled burning of hillside chaparral . Two such burns have been conpleted successfully and more are planned. // Building an appreciation of the park ' s recreational potential is another task Chandler has tackled . Last year , the park staff helped schools and community groups conduct environmental education field trips in the recreation area . Some 40 , 000 children participated , most of them from inner-city neighborhoods . A recent ' ' Springtime in the Santa Monicas ' ' program brought 26 , 000 visitors to the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird watching , and astronomy programs . <> <> The Park Service ' s new involvement in urban America // The Santa Monica Mountains park is part of a recent phenomenon that has been a subject of controversy both within the National Park Service and outside of it . Over the space of six years ( 1972-78 ) , the service was pushed to extend itself to cover a whole new involvement in urban America. // The Nixon administration ' s ' ' Parks for the People ' ' campaign  --  turning surplus federal properties into local parks  --  provided the basic concept . And with help from New York and San Francisco-area members of Congress , the Gateway and Golden Gate National Recreation Areas were authorized in 1972 . In both cases , a number of federally owned natural and cultural sites , not significant enough by themselves to be in the national park system , were lumped together . The Park Service , which had formed a National Capital and Urban Park Affairs Division in 1970 , liberalized its interpretation of ' ' national significance ' ' to include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national parks . <> <> New York City happy to donate Riis beach // New York Mayor John V. Lindsay donated the popular city-owned Jacob Riis Beach , a financial albatross the city was only too pleased to unload . Environmental leaders in California , who had long sought national park status for the Marin County headlands and other areas near San Francisco , advocated the Golden Gate park . Some national park purists objected to what they considered a compromise of standards . But the conservation movement as a whole was interested in meeting some of the needs of inner-city dwellers and joined in support for Gateway and Golden Gate. // Many congressmen and senators soon wanted national recreation areas in their bailiwicks , and at one point the Park Service had some 40 areas under consideration because of congressional requests . Only four more were approved by Congress , however : Cuyahoga National Recreation Area ( between Cleveland and Akron , Ohio ) in 1974 , Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area ( Atlanta ) , Jean LaFitte National Historical Park and Preserve ( New Orleans ) , and Santa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which advises the secretary of the interior , opposed all four. // After Gateway and Golden Gate , the Park Service , which had never really wanted the urban areas , opposed Cuyahoga , Chattahoochee River , Jean LaFitte , and Santa Monica Mountains . These and some of the other units added to the system in the last 10 years were anathema to some Park Service veterans loyal to the **26;9527;TOOLONG Canyon tradition of great scenic national parks . They felt the new units were not of national significance and compromised the high standards of the service . And they saw staffs being plucked from the old-line units and sent off to the new areas . Many rangers , eager to work in wilderness surroundings , chafed at being sent to an urban park. // Congress , quick to authorize the new parks , was not so quick to appropriate adequate funds for operating them . Nor did cost-conscious interior secretaries , beset by other priorities , press for the needed appropriations . Since staffing levels are determined for the most part by number of visitors rather than size @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strain on Park Service manpower . For example , Gateway , with only 26 , 000 acres , now has 53 percent more permanent employees than Yellowstone with its 2. 2 million acres , since Gateway records four times as many visits. // Each of the national recreation areas I visited , however , is protecting valuable pieces of natural landscape and important historic sites , while providing recreation for people unable to travel to the larger , more famous national parks . And for many of the visitors , the experience may serve as an introduction to the national park system , whetting their interest in someday getting to the large , distant national parks such as Yellowstone or Grand Canyon . <> <> Bird watching , fishing , historical landmarks // Gateway National Recreation Area , for instance , is far more than a tangled mass of humanity on Riis Beach , as critics sometimes portray it . The Sandy Hook unit in New Jersey is a small national park in itself , with rugged beaches , havens for many species of birds , the unique 200-acre Holly Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Breezy Point unit , which includes Jacob Riis Beach and Park , also has Fort Tilden , another historical landmark , plus a popular fishing area at the point . The Jamaica Bay unit is highlighted by the 9 , 100-acre wildlife refuge with seven miles of trails , two large ponds , and marshlands and bay for sighting some of the 318 species of birds known to use the area. // And other features of the park serve great numbers of people : Canarsie Pier , for example , where senior citizens gather daily , and Floyd Bennett Field with its Ecology Village set amid a grove of young pine trees . For many inner-city teachers and schoolchildren , an overnight camping experience here provides a first encounter with the outdoors . A major failure of Gateway is the lack of easy public transportation to any of the units , and , particularly , the absence of the ferry system contemplated in original plans for the park. // Across the continent , the other ' ' gateway , ' ' Golden Gate National Recreation Area , is also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be ' ' the largest urban park in the world , ' ' with 68 square miles of land and water and 28 miles of coastline . Golden Gate has the highest visitation  --  19 million in 1981  --  of all 333 national park system units . Some visits , however , may only last long enough to take in the view at such popular spots as Lands End or Cliff House. // No place in the park is more than an hour ' s drive from downtown San Francisco or Oakland . The area offers breathtaking scenery and a variety of recreation  --  hiking in redwood groves , boating , fishing , swimming , camping , or visiting historic areas such as Alcatraz Island. // Without the national recreation area , much of the land would by now probably be lost to housing and commercial development . More than 17 , 000 acres have been purchased since 1972 through the Land and Water Conservation Fund at a cost of $52 million. // The Cuyahoga Valley National Recreation Area in Ohio , like Santa Monica Mountains , protects a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pastoral land squeezed between the urban centers of Cleveland and Akron . The strip following the Cuyahoga River for 20 miles offers many kinds of recreation . It has ecological significance , too , as an outstanding example of a merger of eastern and northern forest plant species with those of the western plains. <> <> 6 , 000 acres still needed to complete plan for park // Cuyahoga ' s historical and archaeological treasures include some 250 historic buildings and 45 prehistoric mounds of the Adena and Hopewell cultures ( 300 B. C. to A. D. 600 ) waiting to be excavated . And the old Ohio and Erie Canal , with hiking and cycling along the towpath trail , has historic , scenic , and recreational values . The 32 , 000 acres of the national recreation area take in seven already established local parks ; the National Park Service has purchased , or has protective easements for , 12 , 000 acres . But 6 , 000 more acres still need protection. // Until Cuyahoga was established in 1974 , a regional federation of 87 groups had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encroachment. // As successful as these urban parks may be , at least in the minds of people living in surrounding metropolitan areas , critics still hold that they lack national significance , drain off Park Service staff and funding , and should be managed by states or municipalities . When the latter idea was floated during the early days of the Reagan administration , the governors of Ohio and California and New York members of Congress expressed anger at even the suggestion. // Watt told a reporter last year that deauthorization of some national recreation areas ' ' needs to be done . ' ' But he added : ' ' I don ' t know if we have the political leadership to do it , the courage to do it now . ' ' However , leaked confidential memos from Watt ' s assistant secretary for fish and wildlife and parks , G. Ray Arnett , to National Park Service director Russell Dickenson showed that this move was being seriously considered . One memo asked for research on areas created by Congress over the objection of the Park Service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other asked Dickenson for research ' ' on the procedure for divestiture of the Santa Monica Mountains NRA ' ' and for similar research on Cuyahoga. // Ohio Rep. John Seiberling , who led the 1974 legislative campaign to pass the Cuyahoga bill , argues that protecting only the great natural parks is elitist. // ' ' We need to take care of the people who can ' t afford to go the long distances and give them a high-quality park experience , ' ' he says . ' ' Also , having parks near the people saves energy . No other part of government except the National Park Service has the capability of providing this high type of recreation on the needed scale , and of doing it well. ' ' // Most Americans have accepted the concept of an evolving national park system that allows for parks in urban areas  --  as well as historic sites , lakeshores , seashores , wild rivers , trails , military parks , and cultural parks  --  as a people ' s need expands. // Freeman Tilden , author of many books on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , believed that every one of the areas could justly be called a national park . ' ' The naming is several , ' ' he wrote , ' ' but the purpose and effect is that of a full representation of the American story - of the earth we live upon , of the races who lived here before the white man came , of the great struggle for possession of the continent , of the winning of the Republic , and finally of our own political and social life.
