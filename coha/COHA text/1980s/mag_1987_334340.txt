NIGHT OF THE FOX <P> by Jack Higgins <P> Simon &; Schuster ; 316 pages ; $17.95 <P> The author 's own disbelief seems not to be wholly suspended in this drowsy , amiable thriller about the German Occupation of Britain 's Channel Islands during World War II . The narrative is full of cinematic echoes . There is a real Field Marshal Erwin Rommel and a fake ( " Heini Baum , Jewish actor and cabaret performer from Berlin and proud of it " ) , both of whom suggest James Mason in the title role of The Desert Fox . There is an Allied intelligence agent living hazardously as a German officer ; Christopher Plummer lounged through just such a role in Hanover Street . A heartbreakingly young and beautiful Englishwoman ( already played by Deborah Kerr , Julie Andrews et al. ) is caught up in the action , as such tales require , feeling " not just sexual desire " but " the promise of danger , excitement of a kind she had never dreamed of before . " <P> No matter ; Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to require a ticket taker out front and popcorn in the lobby . " There 's only one man for this job , " says one master spy . " Only one man capable of playing a Nazi to the hilt and ruthless enough to put a bullet between Kelso 's eyes . " His subordinate reminds him that " Colonel Martineau was given a definite promise after that business in Lyons that his services would n't be required again . His health alone should make it impossible . " Says the counterintelligence officer , summing up neatly : " Nonsense , Jack . " <P> WINDMILLS OF THE GODS <P> by Sidney Sheldon <P> Morrow ; 384 pages ; $18.95 <P> In his seventh blockbuster , Sidney Sheldon has a great time inventing grisly ways of killing his characters . A Rumanian rebel , Marin Groza , has himself beaten by prostitutes as penance for sitting by while his wife and daughter were fatally raped . But this time he is unaware that the whip has been dipped in curare . Harry Lantz , a sleazy womanizer , curls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath water . And the head of another miscreant turns up in a Washington garbage dump . There are a few survivors , notably Professor Mary Ashley , " the opposite of the ugly American , " plucked from her Kansas home to serve as U.S. Ambassador to Rumania . Mary attempts to build bridges with the Communists , but " the gods , " malevolent figures who use code names like Odin , Balder and Thor , have other plans . Whether agents of decency can triumph over the pantheon is , of course , never in question . The Sheldon brand name guarantees a predictable mix of global gore and paperback psychopathology . Goodness has nothing to do with it . <P> A SEASON ON THE BRINK <P> by John Feinstein <P> Macmillan ; 311 pages ; $16.95
