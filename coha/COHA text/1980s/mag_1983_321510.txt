The gaily colored Air Florida 737 jet from Miami had barely taxied to a halt at the Tegucigalpa airport when a column of trucks loaded with Honduran policemen careered across the runway to head it off . As police surrounded the aircraft , troops slithered down ropes from helicopters hovering overhead and flung themselves on the ground with rifles ready . The cause of their concern : the arrival of 40 clergywomen , the first planeload of 140 American and Canadian nuns and lay workers headed for a four-day prayerful protest against U.S. policy in Central America . The Honduran government barred the other 100 even before they left the U.S. , calling them " subversives , " but the Sandinista government in neighboring Nicaragua invited all 140 women to pursue their protest there . <P> Nicaragua has become a mecca for Americans who reject the Reagan Administration 's policy of saber rattling and providing covert aid to the contras seeking to overthrow the leftist Sandinista government . Several hundred American residents of Nicaragua lend the government their expertise in such fields as agriculture , health , culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the U.S. sponsor as many as ten different delegations every month for brief but busy tours of revolutionary life . <P> Housewives , professors , actors , doctors , writers , clergymen , nuns , computer programmers , retirees and students tumble off the afternoon Aeronica flight from Miami , loosening ties and donning VIVA SANDING ! T shirts in anticipation of tropical heat and revolutionary fervor . The itinerary includes weekly " face the people " meetings that Nicaraguan leaders usually hold in poor barrios of Managua . " We are ashamed , truly ashamed , as U.S. citizens , about the Reagan Administration policy toward Nicaragua , " proclaimed Paula Braverman , a San Francisco physician , at a recent rally . <P> Once a week between 7:30 and 8:30 a.m. , about 30 Americans gather outside the U.S. embassy to wave placards , chant and sing . One popular new song : " Do n't rescue me , I want to be free . " U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quainton tries to receive every delegation that passes through to " answer their questions . " <P> The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help harvest the coffee crop , while other U.S. volunteers began rotating two-week vigils in hot spots along the Honduran border . They hope to act as a " human shield " to discourage contra attacks . " We do n't want to minimize the risk , " says Jim Wallis , a religious organizer from Washington who is now in Nicaragua . " But we believe it 's time for U.S. citizens to share that risk . " <P> Despite recent peace feelers by Managua to Washington , most of the pro-Sandinista solidarity groups see little chance that U.S. policy will change . But the Yankees have no intention of going home . Says Witness for Peace Spokesman Dennis Marker : " We are prepared to continue our vigil until the U.S. ends its support of the contras .
