The author of the Making of the President series , one of the foremost experts on U.S. politics , examines the surging forces that not only helped re-elect Ronald Reagan but mil play a major role in determining the outcome of the next campaign for America 's highest office <P> Every American election presents history with a puzzle ; and this issue of TIME opens with the solution to a part of the puzzle . We now know that Ronald Reagan has been reelected . But the larger part of the puzzle is left to solve : How does this election fit into the longer story of American politics and history ? What did it mean ? <P> This was the dreariest political carnival in 20 years . Yet it was more than carnival , for it was fought on two levels . On one level were the classic issues , all sprayed over with statistics and figures : disputed factoids of missile and nuclear capability , of budget entitlements , of thunderhead deficits that could prove anything any candidate wanted to prove . Yet underneath , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultures . At bottom the candidates were talking about the community of Americans , torn by enormous surges of new forces , bewildered by how to greet or resist them . The campaign was about how we live together-in short , about our culture as a nation in change . <P> What 1984 bequeaths to 1988 is far more than the timeworn questions debated since 1960 , when Richard Nixon described the central problem as How We Keep the Peace Without Surrender and John Kennedy proclaimed , " We must move again . " What this campaign promises is the rearrangement of much of the old familiar political scenery and the way we see each other . <P> So the election of 1988 begins now . <P> The 1984 election pitted two men against each other-party chieftains both , but entirely different symbolic characters . They saw America differently . <P> On one side sat an aging Ronald Reagan , still tall in the saddle , holding forth a future rooted in a mythic past of heroic patriots and open opportunity . He rode into the election with several large achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery and a substantial defense buildup . But he bore the burden of a monstrous deficit for whose solution he offered only the Band-Aid of a balanced-budget amendment . He may frequently have been wrong on his facts , but he spoke to the wordless groping of millions of Americans seeking comfort in the future . Reagan wanted to slow the entire tempo of change speeding Americans to disturbing ends-from encroaching Government and welfare dependency to the drug epidemic and crime in the streets . He saw the future in the lost summertime of the nation 's past , when neighborhoods were safe , when families held together ( though his first marriage had not ) , when U.S. power bestrode the world . He wrapped both past and future in the American flag . <P> Against him , as the candidate of the Out party , stood Walter Mondale . The Out party must always cope with the new surges and forces of this restless country , unrestrained by the discipline of a sitting President . But in 1984 so many new surges were pressing up from underneath that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primaries . Mondale , a man of conscience but also a master political mechanic , had tried to swallow them all , to bring a coherence to the multitude of
