We heard the VC mortar crews dropping the first mortar rounds into their tubes with a clear click . We heard the nearly simultaneous thump and whomp , and then all hell broke loose . There they were with their automatic Kalashnikovs and rocket-propelled grenades and what looked like Browning automatic rifles and plain old hand grenades ; we had our M-16s and M-60 machine guns , our shotguns and frags , 105 and 155 howitzers and 8-inch cannon ( " Big Mama " and " Dooley " and " Bristol 's Stomp " ) all the way from Phuc Luc . Soon the sky blazed with a keen silver light from dozens of illumination rounds that gave everything a sour , deathly pallor , and showered us with sputtering chunks of phosphorous ash . The air smelled of gunpowder and scorched iron , and was soon thick with the smell of blood . It was hard to hear yourself think above the shrill screaming and shouting of commands , the constant crackle of rifle shots in both ears and the booming explosions that rang and reverberated like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke and dust kicked up by all the muzzle flashes . You stood stooped behind those rough sandbag revetments , pulling off well-aimed shots as quickly as you could squeeze the trigger . There was never a lack of targets and if there was you popped off rounds at the wounded lying everywhere , until they stopped their squirming and their incessant yammering . You felt your hand cramp , hard , as you reloaded magazine after magazine . Then wham  --  slam  --  your sore , aching eye ( the bad eye those goddamn army doctors told you to never mind ? terrifically explodes , goes dead , and you feel your face droop like a gob of warmed wax . You feel the sharp sting and tingle when the burning-hot rifle slug pierces your eyeball , your head , and goes clean through and out the hack blowingyour helmet off as though it had been flipped up with a good swift kick . The concussion blows you out of the trench , knocking the wind out of you . The cool of the dirt seeps through your bloody shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sponge . Your hands curl into fists , clawing hard at the dirt . You suck breath through a pinched gullet , trying to get your wind back for a scream , listening to your own trembling death rattle , like buttons and pebbles and pins stirred round in a tin . You watch through the blood and dust with your one good eye , and listen tensely , suddenly aware of a peculiar roaring buzz that you have never heard before . It becomes an overwhelming , ear-piercing whine that you would swear was splitting your head wide open . The sound can not be just the mortarsor the howitzers or the cannon , or everything at once . It can not be a single bomb or a hundred bombs ; it is a wild shitstorm of bombs . Everyone looks up , GIs and zips , and knows it is every goddamn incoming round left in creation , a ball-busting cataclysm . The very ground you lie on heaves up , and your body gives way , as though someone has dropped a spot of dirt into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trail behind that spot until it dissolves and nothing reaches bottom but a swirling film . Everything  --  the woods and the village and us with it  --  is heaved up and plowed under ; one instant we take a breath , we scream our lungs flat , and then we are dead and gone . EmeMagr. .. : rE ; - ' : ; . - 4H : : : : 0ERVISAS m Y MAN PACO , not dead , but sure as shit should be , lies flat on his back and wide to the sky with slashing lacerations , big watery burn blisters , and broken , splintered , ruined legs . He wallows in this greasy , silken muck that covers him ( and everything else for a stone 's throw ) and dries to a stinking , sandy crust . He lies there that night and all the next day , the next night and half the second day with his heels hooked on a gnarled , charred ( nearly fire-hardened ) vine root , immobile . And he comes to consciousness in the dark of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the rags of his clothes , and he does n't know what hit him . ( Am I ever fucked up , he thinks to himself , but he does n't so much say this or even think this as he imagines looking down at his own body , seeing  --  vividly  --  every gaping shrapnel nick , every puckery burn scar , every splintery , compounded fracture . ) At first he concentrates his whole considerable attention to listening  --  for the cries , the hoarse , gulped breathing , the whispering supplication of the other wounded , for water , for Jigs the medic , for God 's simple mercy . ( I swear you have not heard anything in this life until you have heard small clear voices in the dark of the night , " Help me , please , " though they say that the crying of wounded horses is worse . ) Paco waits , with closed eyes and stilled breath , to shiver and be appalled at the dry , raspy voices ; waits to whisper back quickly in answer . So Paco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking like a living thing  --  until he comes to understand it as a living thing , as if some small animal with bristling , matted fur had snuggled up to him for warmth ) and stares , marveling , into the black and vaulted heavens , his vision blurred by blood and dust . 56 dead ass for once and hop his fucken chopper and do it himself . And why ca n't he pick on somebody else for a change . All right , get up ! ' he said , ' Let 's go , ' and went around kicking at people . " The captain was antsy anyway , a real eager beaver when you got right down to it look-ing for his Purple Hearts and his medals  --  so we saddled up and started off in the middle of the night . Well , shit fire , we got about 200 meters downrange when the point squad stepped in some shit  --  a three-man ambush that we just buried in this shitstorm of ( rags . But we had one KIA and two wounded . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we did n't get going again until after daybreak . We thrashed around in those fucken woods  --  the Goongone Forest , you understand ? ? that night , the next day , the next night , and that day . And we were always lost . I swear to God , Jack , there were more dumb fucks per square inch in Bravo Company than anywhere . The cap would flip open the bullshit company compass and sight it on the company map . gawking at the numerals on the dial , and thinking to himself , ' What is this goddamn gizmo ? Some kind of chickenshit Cracker Jack prize ? ' He would bang it against his leg , like it was waterlogged and maybe that would help . Then he 'd have another shit fit , kicking stumps and throwing food and so forth , but then he 'd take a drink of water and simmer down , and we 'd proceed . " The medic carefully cracks the hard-boiled eggs , then twists the shells back and forth so that they will be rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning of the second day we found Fire Base Harriette and what was left of Alpha Company , which was n't much more than a smell I could n't begin to compare to anything I 've smelled since . There was nothing there , Jack , not even the village or the French fort , just this one guy , that poor dumb fucker . Alpha Company got wiped out . The whole company , except for this one cat , caught some mean kind of shit and every swinging dick but him bought the mother . fucker . Why ai n't he dead ? He had a fucken day and a half . Why did n't he bleed to death ? Why ai n't he shriveled up with heat stroke ? That place stank to high heaven . He stank to high heaven . I often wonder why we did n't keep fucken walking . A bunch of us stood where we jolly well knew the command bunker should have been  --  everybody 's pulled time at Harriette . We took one good look around us  --  no bunkers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't going to find enough of those guys to fill a dozen peck baskets . " The medic will lean back in his chairand look up at the bartender , who listens for the hundredth time , blandly looking around his bar and counting the chairs the medic has emptied . PAA-ONS ? ? : ; ; f3tW : 0 N THAT DAY at Harriette the captain ( a robust and thoughtful man , astonished and enraged , bewildered and infuriated by his continuing bad luck ? irritated to distraction ) stood with the medic and the radio man and the others near the command bunker , teetering on a chunk of timber with his thumbs hooked on his rucksack straps  --  his rucksack crammed as full and piled as high as any rucksack in his company . He gazed around at the carnage and wreckage and thought to himself , this is a mean way to die and a rotten goddamn piece of luck to be sure , but thank the mother of God , at least this one time it is n't me and mine , " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the medic says , resuming , brushing bits of egg yolk out of his mustache , " he was piping hot and still pouring sweat , mumbling gibberish and crying . He was n't wearing his dogtags like he was supposed to , so God only knew who he was . But why he was n't dead is anybody 's guess . I did n't know , and I did n't want to know . He looked up at me , trying to be friendly somehow or other . And he knew he was fucked up . It did n't take no genius . His legs were so torn up , like someone would snap twigs for kindling , that the sonsabitching dust-off medics slipped him into a spare body bag to save everything but his asshole  --  though he still had his cock and his balls , you understand . And the rest of him looked like someone had taken off after him with one of those long-handled mallets you tenderize meat with . " Anyway , I took one good long look at the guy , flies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuzzy  --  and I 've fucken had it . " The young medic stood with the captain and the rest , staring down at Paco , and a wave of saddening disgust went through him that drained the blood from his face , and he was revolted , defeated . " I turned to the other company medic , this Conscientious Objector , and said , Tuck this , Jack  --  or whatever your name is  --  you do it . I 'm goddamn sick and fucken tired of these sonsabitches dying on me . I ai n't gon na eat this shit anymore . I quit ... ' " But the Conscientious Objector fumbled and grab-assed , nervous and humiliated , and generally made such a muddle of it that the first medic finally pushed him aside and finished , applying what aid he could . He asked Paco company thought , There goes the company jinx , now maybe our luck will change . The medic mounted the morning chopper come to collect the body bags and the several tub-sized thermoses as big as Coleman coolers ( " mermight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat slumped and resolute on the strap bench next to the portside-door gunner with his rucksack and aid bag between his feet , and his rifle in his lap . The medic dismounted immediately when the chopper touched down at Phuc Luc , as if he had been catapulted , throwing his beat-to-hell rucksack over one shoulder and his aid bag over the other , like a bum 's bundles . He walked off the smooth , oily tarmac of the chopper pad as though he had never seen that chopper before in his life , and turned north up the hill toward the battalion and company tents . He passed the base-camp headquarters building= where the brigade busybodies and staff lifers lounged in the shade with vodka and tonics in one hand and long black cheroots in the other , watching the truck traffic . The medic passed the base-camp engineers with their water-purification truck and portable cement mixer , their concrete-block hooches and walk-in ice locker , where they stood around picking their teeth while overseeing a truckload of broken-clown old women from the village filling sandbags . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now crawling with hordes of lawyers from the Judge Advocate 's office , Red Cross do-gooders gathered from far and wide , and freelance newsmen ( and that kind I. scavenging , pulling a nice fast buck for Time and the Washington Post and the L.A. Times . ( F.B. HARRIETTE WIPED OUT . EXCLUSIVE PHOTOGRAPHS . SEC'TY VOWS MORE TROOPS . ) They stood around in small groups and gawked , scribbling notes and names , pestering each other with questions and comments . They rummaged through footlockers and duffel bags and waterproof canvas bags , rifling through gear and belongings that were n't any of their business , sucking on unlit pipes , and shaking their heads at the pure pity of it . And finally the medic turned briskly up the Bravo Company street . The company clerks typing their forms and the mess-tent cooks stirring their pool-Aid and the housecat walking wounded with their games of paper-scissors-stone looked up . drawn to the sight of the medic like an apparition " What on earth is the medic doing in camp , " they said among themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company ? " The medic turned sharply up the second path to the left among the company hooches and disappeared into his own open-air hooch . He draped his gear and aidbag over the homemade headboard of his cot , peeled off his stinking jungle shirt , and went directly to the piss tube out back to relieve himself . Exhausted and sickly pale he flopped headlong , boots and all , onto his cot , and almost instantly fell into a deep slumber . He woke in the late afternoon , nearly nightfall , dripping with sweat , his face red and puffy with sleep and his mouth cotton dry ; the quilted sleeping bag and poncho liner he used for a mattress well soaked . By that time the word of his finding Paco and then quitting like that was all over camp . That night he sat in his hooch with his feet up , eating his C-rations , listening to the loud and sticky keys of the company clerk 's Underwood manual typewriter  --  tack-tack , tacktack-tack-tack  --  the clerk writing home of that Alpha Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the medic through the flimsy screen door . And for weeks and months afterward , until the medic rotated home in his proper turn , he stood on the ammunition-box stoop of his hooch ( the company jinx ) , leaning on an ordinary push broom in the drooping canvas doorway , and watched the rest of Bravo Company come and go to the field  --  each time more scroungy and grungy and hangdog-looking than the time before . There were always fewer faces when they came humping those last three hundred meters up the hill from the base camp gate ; always newer faces , pale and astonished , when they left again . But do n't you know , a month or six weeks later when the company came back through the gate and up that hill those new guys would be indistinguishable from the rest , except for the eyes . But the eyes took longer . A ND TEN , TWELVE , FIFTEEN years later the medic will rock back and forth , night after night , in a chair near the wall of cases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grill , telling his stories . By the end of an evening ( when it is good and dark ) the medic will be good and drunk , but he can still crack those hard-boiled eggs and render the bleached shells neatly in two before he dips them in salt and dunks each bite in hot mustard . And he 's not so drunk he ca n't still drink his beers and shots right down ( until one year he will drink himself sick and die I. Almost any night of the week he will sit there and brag that he could have made something of himself . " Would have been a goddamn good doctor , hear ? " he will tell you in his thick alcoholic slur . " Except for this one guy , this geek , " the guy not dead , but should have been . El
