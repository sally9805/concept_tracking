THE TALK OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment ONE of the most peculiar and at the same time most revealing episodes of the state of martial law in Poland has been the government 's capture and detention of Lech Walesa , the elected leader of the now suspended Solidarity movement . From the start , his status has been ambiguous . The government has not said that he has been arrested . Yet he has not been allowed to go free . On being asked why Walesa was in Warsaw , where the government apparently first held him , Jerzy Urban , a government spokesman , replied vaguely , " Because that is where the government wants him . " The only thing that the world really knows about his circumstances is that he has not been allowed to speak to the world on his own behalf . Meanwhile , the government has taken on itself the task of giving out certain pieces of supposed information about his activities . At the start of the crisis , the government claimed that he was in negotiation with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing him sitting with a man in military uniform . The military man looked cheerful and expansive ; Walesa looked tense , stiff , and glum . Then , as though to explain the failure of these " negotiations " to produce any results , a story began to make the rounds that Walesa had suffered a nervous breakdown and was weeping uncontrollably . A later story put out by a government official was that Walesa had been ready to make a statement to the nation counselling the futility of resistance to martial law but that the Church  --  an ally of Solidarity in its fight against the government for human rights in Poland  --  had persuaded the government that to permit Walesa to speak would be a mistake , since any sign of support by him for the government would so thoroughly destroy his credibility with the public that his usefulness for other purposes later on would be destroyed ; in other words , Walesa himself was eager to express his support for martial law , but the government , at the behest of the Church , was wisely restraining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be moved to " a monastery " ? almost as though the Church had now kidnapped him , or he had decided to retire from the world and become a recluse . But speaking much louder than these and other unlikely stories about Walesa has been his silence , which the world ' can only interpret as a rejection of the regime . And the longer that silence has gone on , the louder it has become , until now it in a way drowns out all the noisy propaganda that the government is pouring into Poland and the rest of the world through its state-run media . For Walesa is not just any person ; he is unquestionably the person in Poland who is best qualified to speak for the Polish nation , having been elected to his position in Solidarity in the only free elections that Poland has known since the Communists came to power . ( It is another confirmation of his de-facto leadership of the Polish people that , according to reports apparently circulated by sources other than the government , he has refused to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidium of Solidarity , whose members were also elected to their positions , is with him . ) From its actions so far , it seems that the government thought that by capturing Walesa it could capture his political legitimacy , too , and transfer it to itself , as though legitimacy were a physical thing , like a bag of money that burglars could make off with . Thus , it has both locked up Walesa and spread stories that it is in negotiation with him and can hardly restrain him from foolishly expressing his support for the regime . But these are desperate measures . A government so lacking in popular support that it seeks to shine in the reflected glory of its political prisoners is in some kind of deep trouble . One wonders how long it can stand without drastic changes . WE received the following com-munication from a friend : I spent the Christmas holidays visiting relatives in Northville , Michigan , a snug suburban community fifteen miles west of Detroit which has suddenly found itself in the center of an economic maelstrom . Northville is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by new snow , as it was two days before Christmas . There is a historic center , which consists of a shopping area that has been spruced up with brick sidewalks and antique street lamps , and of several streets of tall , narrow , pastel-colored Victorian wooden houses , so attractively ornamented that they are often used as a background for automobile ads . Surrounding this core is a circle of post-Second World War housing developments : winding roads lined with imposing mansions , which are inhabited by Detroit-based executives , and smaller ranch houses and condominiums , which belong to the middle and lower echelons of the work force . ( Rarely in such developments do you find a straight road . The people who built them were so preoccupied with the appearance of individuality that they planned everything in loops . ) Northville has three good restaurants ( Genitti 's , an old-fashioned place with brick walls and home-style cooking ; MacKinnon 's , a casual , country-style French bistro ; and Elizabeth 's , a more expensive French establishment , which occupies the ground floor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand-dips its chocolates ; a yarn shop that sells hand-woven garments as well as the equipment ( raw materials and looms ) for making them ; a motion-picture theatre that has been refurbished in turn-of-the-century style to resemble the vaudeville house it once was ; a post office ; a town hall ; and six churches  --  Catholic , Methodist , Baptist , Presbyterian , Lutheran , and Christian Community . Until recently , the main industries were a race track for trotting horses ( racing goes on here in weather that would intimidate a Siberian Husky ) and the Ford Motor Company 's Northville Valve Plant , a long , low building next to a creek . A paddle wheel at one end of the building recalls its original existence as a sawmill . In 1919 , when Henry Ford was setting up satellite plants to feed automotive parts into his Detroit assembly lines , he turned the sawmill into a factory , and he began producing valves for tractors and Model T 's there the following year . The race track is still drawing crowds , but the valve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed down on December 23rd , the day I arrived in Northville . Although the workers had organized a last-minute effort to buy the plant , for three million dollars , Ford turned down the proposition , on the ground that the factory was too old and too small to produce valves economically . Ford also said , in an official statement , that the reduced demand for valves caused by the switch to smaller , four- and six-cylinder engines was an additional reason for shutting down the plant . The Northville Record , which quoted the Ford statement , pointed out in the same story that Ford now buys its valves from a non-union Eaton Corporation plant in Nebraska , and added that this " out-sourcing of parts ... will be a leading topic of debate when the union leaders discuss contract reopeners . " It is unlikely that the U.A.W. will save the Northville plant , because production stopped on November 20th , and the workers who remained on the job until the end dismantled the machinery . Of its two hundred and thirty employees , forty-three either have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retirement . This leaves Northville with a hundred and eighty-seven skilled and semi-skilled workers  --  the people living in the ranch houses and the condominiums  --  who will be unemployed , probably , at least for the rest of the winter . Northville , which has eight police cars and fourteen policemen , worries about an increase in crime . And people wonder what will happen to these workers when the benefits run out and many of them have to go on welfare . On the same day that the valve plant closed , the Detroit News ran a full-page story on unemployment under the headline " TIM /5 RUNNING SHORT FOR MICHIGAN 'S JOBLESS . " In it , a reporter named Steven Rosenfeld pointed out that , with the automobile industry in a prolonged slump ( it lost four billion dollars last year and , it is estimated , will lose one billion four hundred million in 1982 ) and unemployment benefits running out for workers who were laid off last year , " Edna tells me we have n't been seeing enough of you folks , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around Detroit was getting desperate . " In the past eighteen months , the number of people seeking food from relief organizations ... has tripled , " Rosenfeld wrote . " Twice as many people are on the state welfare roll as in 1979 . Burglaries have increased 18 percent , and robberies 16 percent .... Job related emotional illness , alcoholism , drug abuse and suicide attempts have increased , In Federal Bankruptcy Court in Detroit 5,338 companies were declared bankrupt in the first ten months of this year , more than 2,000 more than failed during the same period in 1979 . People are not buying many new cars . Prices are high . And the proportion of new car sales captured by foreign companies is high . " For an automotive community such as Northville , the proliferation of foreign cars in its own state is the ultimate indignity . Michigan people are buying Toyotas , IIondas , and Datsuns . There arc rumors of attacks on foreign cars in factory parking lots and of angry confrontations at service stations . But the Detroit newspapers carry long lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sale . And on Christmas Eve , driving home with my cousin on an icy road , I noticed a small silver-gray Toyota sliding to a stop at the intersection in front of us ; it disappeared down a winding lane as strings of colored lights  --  framing doorways and windows , encircling snow-clad trees and bushes  --  began to twinkle in the gathering dusk . A few minutes later , when we were passing the dark , silent Ford plant , my cousin remarked that he 'd heard that a group of investors wanted to turn the building into a shopping center . " They 'll have to be willing to take care of the ducks , though , " he said , stopping for a moment to point out several clusters of dark-brown birds that stood out against the snow . He explained that for the last twenty years Northville has had several hundred wild ducks living permanently in a millpond next to the Ford paddle wheel . " When we knew the plant was going to close , our mayor negotiated an agreement with the company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter , " he said . " Ford provides feed , and the city supplies the manpower to distribute it . It 's ironic , is n't it ? Here we are in the middle of the worst economic crisis that Northville has ever faced , and the one positive thing we 've been able to do is to make sure that those birds survive .

Shoemaker TN the subway arcade beneath Forty-second Street and Eighth Ave-nue  --  a very heavily travelled thor-oughfare and one of the most dan-gerous spots in the city  --  there is a group of shops which includes a piz-za parlor , a dough-nut stand , a barber-shop , a games parlor that stays open around the clock , and a tiny shoe-repair shop . De-spite the great number of distracting elements in the arcade and the constant crush that urges most pedestrian traffic on , our atten-tion was drawn one morning by the man who occupies the shoe-repair shop . He was standing behind the window of his shop , looking out and calmly puffing on a cigarette , which he held between his thumb and index finger . The man looked to us to be about sixty , and he was wearing a green smock , eyeglasses in bulky dark frames , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s a conductor 's podium . From there , with a baton , you can lead eighty to ninety guys. ) , impressive , clean-shaven head . He would have been the perfect picture of a jaunty foreign bohemian-except that his build , sturdy and compact , and a slight stoop suggested that he had the strength of a farmer , not a watercolorist . When the man suddenly changed the direction of his gaze , he noticed us outside his shop and acknowledged us with a little salute . We decided to go in . The shop is divided in two by a glass counter . On one side is the working area , which contains all the cutting and grinding machinery , several metal shoe stands on which the repairman 's work-in-progress can be mounted , and , along the wall , a basic inventory of parts and products for the shoe . On the other side is an area for customers , consisting of three aluminum-and-vinyl chairs , which might once have belonged to an oversized dinette set , and just enough room to stand in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man asked us . We said no , we wanted to talk with him awhile . We took a seat . We asked how he came to be in the Forty-second Street subway arcade . From the expression on his face , we saw that the question did n't quite register , so we asked him what his native language was . " I speak all language , " he replied . " What you want . I am Polish , I am Russian , I am German , I am whatever . You want fixen shoes , I am looken . O.K. , thank you . " In all the languages he-mentioned , with only a minor contribution in English , the man introduced himself as Isaac Beckman , from the city of Lvov , in a part of the U.S.S.R. not far beyond what is now the Polish border . Mr. Beckman told us that for forty-five years he had been a shoemaker and shoe repairman , as his father and his grandfather were before him ; that he had been in the United States for seven months ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of joining his wife 's mother and brother , who had emigrated to New York several years ago , but that a month after they arrived the mother-in-law died , and shortly thereafter the brother-in-law became ill and left to recuperate in California ; and that before the brother-in-law left , three months ago , he had presented Mr. Beckman with his shoe-repair business in the Forty-second Street subway arcade . A young man flung the door open , sending in a blast of wild electronic sound from the games parlor mingled with a hubbub of voices and footsteps . " Could you give me some traction here ? " he asked , pointing to his shoes , which were fairly new Italian loafers . " These are too slippery . I need some more traction . " Mr. Beckman appeared not to understand what the young man said , but he looked the shoes over and said , " Lifts . O.K. , I am fixen . Sit down , please . " He proceeded to cut , glue , nail , huff , and spray a new pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . When the young man had left , we asked Mr. Beckman whether he had had a shop like this back in Lvov . " Oh , no , " he said , in his mixture of languages . " There you do not have one man , one shop . The place where I
