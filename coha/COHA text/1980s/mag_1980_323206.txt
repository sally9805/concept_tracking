Off the business page and onto the front page , a new soap opera <P> A television camera was panning the crowd at the Republican National Convention in Detroit last July when it zoomed in for a closeup of former President Gerald Ford . But wait , who was that handsome couple smiling fondly at each other nearby ? Knowledgeable viewers recognized them as William M. Agee , 42 , soon-to-be-divorced chairman of the Bendix Corp . in Southfield , Mich. , and Mary E. Cunningham , 29 , his rapidly promoted vice president for strategic planning . That TV image was the first journalistic glimmer of a story that has gathered enough momentum in the past five weeks to eclipse national interest in who shot J.R . <P> The story broke Sept. 24 when Agee told 600 employees at a company meeting that his friendship with Cunningham was not a factor in her swift rise . As of last week , the Mary and Bill story had rated coverage in practically every major newspaper and magazine , several sober editorials , a FORTUNE cover and , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some 50 newspapers by the Chicago Tribune/New York News Syndicate . Written by New Journalist Gail Sheehy ( Passages ) , the series unblushingly depicts Cunningham as an angel , awesomely gifted , scrupulously moral and out to improve the world through humane capitalism ; it is laced with enough mawkish prose and gratuitous personal detail to make Harold Robbins blush .

Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the ' 80s . " <P> The Sheehy series touched off minor competitive dramas in several cities where it appeared . In San Francisco , where the Tribune Syndicate 's regular customer is the Examiner ( circ. 159,000 ) , the rival Chronicle ( circ. 507,000 ) snatched the series instead . " There was a bleep-up , " said an angry Reg Murphy , the Examiner 's editor . Murphy struck back with a survey of Bay Area business executives , all of whom said they would hire Cunningham on the spot .
