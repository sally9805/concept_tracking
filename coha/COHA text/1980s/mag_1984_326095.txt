An effervescent editor makes way for a patrician protg <P> When Thomas Winship took over in 1965 as editor of the Boston Globe , the city was considered a journalistic backwater , and the paper was not rated as even the best of the six in town . Its news coverage had lost the crusading spirit of its early days as a " people 's daily " fighting Brahmin interests . The editorial page featured wambling , civics-text platitudes . There were advertisements on Page One . Winship 's arduous task was made more delicate by family diplomacy : his predecessor was his father , Laurence Winship , who had dominated the paper for 40 years . <P> Undeterred , the new editor hired young , iconoclastic writers whom he called " my city-room Weathermen , " hailed the counterculture and turned the paper vehemently against the Viet Nam War . The Globe won its first Pulitzer Prize the year after he took over , for probing the credentials of a federal-judgeship nominee who was a Kennedy family retainer ; it has since won ten more , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms control . During Winship 's tenure , circulation jumped about 40% , to 520,000 daily and 793,000 ( eighth in the U.S. ) on Sunday . Last week this era came to a scheduled close : Winship , 64 , announced that he will retire in January to set up a program to train Third World journalists . Said he : " It is about time . I have had a lucky life , and this new project is a longtime dream , a useful way to help the less fortunate . " <P> His successor is Sunday Managing Editor Michael Janeway , 44 , who joined the paper in 1978 after a decade as a top editor at the Atlantic and a stint as an aide to Secretary of State Cyrus Vance . Said Publisher William Taylor , whose family has owned and run the Globe since its inception in 1872 : " Mike shares Tom 's strong commitment to tackle the problems of the city , and has a lot of his sense of outrage . " Janeway triumphed in a two-year power struggle that divided the staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heir apparent , some reporters protested directly to Taylor that they saw him as aloof , enigmatic and almost relentless in getting his own way . Put under orders by Winship and Taylor not to respond to attacks during what he calls " the year of gossiping dangerously , " Janeway gradually won over his rivals and the staff , and at last week 's announcement he was greeted with subdued but sustained applause . <P> The contrast in style between the two editors could hardly be more acute . Winship is elfin , effervescent , demonstrative and unassumingly rumpled . He tells stories of his financially modest youth and calls himself a " swamp Yankee . " Janeway is shy , sardonic , reserved and elegant . He has the seigneurial manner befitting a son of Economics Columnist Eliot Janeway and Author Elizabeth Janeway ( Powers of the Weak ) . Perhaps the only obvious characteristic the men share is that like dozens of their staffers they are graduates of Harvard , yet they agree on the problems the paper must correct .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
