The May 27 editorial ( " INF ' s Killer Condition " ) attacks with vigor the efforts , since successful , of the Democratic majority in the Senate to add to the INF Treaty resolution of ratification an understanding that , in the future , would prohibit the reinterpretation of that treaty by the president without congressional approval . You complain that this would reverse the constitutional separation of powers , and you add that " the President is supposed to have total authority for treaties , from negotiating them to interpreting their meaning , with the large exception that the Senate has complete veto power simply by withholding its two-thirds consent . " Although this summary overstates the case ( by omitting the fact that the Constitution calls for the Senate ' s advice as well as its consent ) , it still does not support your conclusion ; in fact , it argues persuasively for the contrary result . You say the president has " total authority for treaties , from negotiating them to interpreting their meaning .

Take for example the ABM Treaty , the " reinterpretation " of which gave rise to the current controversy . President Richard Nixon and his staff negotiated this treaty , which was signed and ratified in 1972 . At that time , those directly involved , including Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird , advised the Senate that , among other things , testing of lasers in space was prohibited . In fact , administration testimony was so unequivocal on that issue that then-Sen . James Buckley ( R. , N.Y. ) voted against the treaty because of that prohibition . Now President Reagan asserts that the ratification record is irrelevant and that his " Star Wars " program , including laser testing in space , can go forward under his reinterpretation . But what about the president who actually negotiated the treaty and submitted it to the Senate for ratification ?

There is no question about that . And so Sen. Nunn is absolutely correct on that point . " What motivation can the Senate have to ensure the soundness of any treaty presented to it if the Journal is correct and any future administration has the right to sweep with impunity all of the Senate ' s careful scrutiny under the table ? By granting the executive such excessive power the Journal would discard the constitutional system of checks and balances and would open us up for a free-for-all in which no treaty would be safe from reinterpretation by Republican and Democratic presidents alike . By the way , will the Journal maintain its view of the president ' s " total authority " when President Dukakis re-reinterprets the ABM Treaty and returns to the original Nixon view ?

Sam Nunn and his fellow Democrats might be interested in this early exchange between Edmond Charles Genet , the French minister to the United States , and the American secretary of state concerning the authority to interpret treaties . Genet insisted that the authority belonged to Congress . " Were they not sovereign ? " Genet demanded . " They are sovereign only in making laws , " the secretary explained . " The executive is sovereign in executing them , and the judiciary in construing them where they relate to their department . " " But , at least , " said Genet , " Congress are bound to see that the treaties are observed . " " No , " the secretary replied , " the President is to see that treaties are observed .
