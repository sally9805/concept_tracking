It was a debacle , an 11-0 blowout by the Kansas City Royals , and when it was over , Manager Whitey Herzog stood in the Cardinals ' locker room and said to the President of the United States on the telephone : // " Yes , sir , President Reagan . I ' m sorry we didn ' t put on a better show . We kind of stunk up the place tonight. " // It was a furious and disastrous ending to an otherwise melodramatic season for the Cardinals . John Tudor , their best pitcher , was knocked out by the Royals in the third inning and then cut his left forefinger and required hospital treatment after he punched an electric fan in the dugout . And , after some pushing and shoving during the six-run fifth inning , both Herzog and Joaquin Andujar were ejected by Don Denkinger , the umpire they had accused of costing them the Series when they were three outs from winning it Saturday night. // The Cardinals conceded that they were stunned by what they had done : They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series when they were 2-to-1 favorites . And they continued to blame the umpiring in the sixth game for making the seventh game necessary. // But they exonerated the umpires for tonight ' s disaster , even though Herzog and Andujar both charged at Denkinger , the American League umpire who called the fateful play at first base in Game 6 and who worked home plate in Game 7. // " Losing the sixth game meant losing the seventh game , " Herzog said in a subdued and even shocked locker room . " But the umpiring had nothing to do with our getting our butts kicked , 11-0 . It had something to do with our losing last night. // " But our problem tonight was that John couldn ' t get his pitches over . And we haven ' t really hit in a month . We stole 314 bases this season , and two in the World Series . We won 101 games in the regular season , four in the playoff and three in the Series , and we scored only 13 runs in the Series . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a precise left-hander , symbolized the violent end to the season for the Cardinals . He is a reserved and spare person who won 21 games and lost only 8 this season , and who won a key game in the playoff for the National League pennant and then two more in the Series. // But , after he was removed by Herzog in the third inning , already five runs down , he went to the dugout and punched a motionless electric fan on a ledge in back of the bench . He cut his finger , and was promptly taken to the hospital , where he received several stitches . <> <> ' A Foolish Thing ' // " What I did was a foolish thing , " Tudor said later . " But it ' s between me and my conscience. " // " He ' s got a cut on his finger , " Herzog said . " He was upset . He swung at the electric fan in his frustration . But he ' s O.K. We ' re told there ' s no tendon damage. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger , Herzog was busy rushing to the mound to rescue Andujar , a 21-game winner who has won only one game in the last two months . Andujar got into the game as the fifth of the seven Cardinal pitchers who tried to stop the Royal rout . He gave up a single to Frank White , then went to three balls on Jim Sundberg and headed for home plate. // " When you ' ve got something taken away from you , you get teed off , " Herzog said , explaining the mood . " Joaquin wasn ' t arguing , he just wanted to talk to his catcher . So , I went out to protect him . I didn ' t argue the call with Denkinger . But I did yell : ' We shouldn ' t even be out here tonight . We should be home celebrating. ' // " I know he didn ' t miss a popup , and he didn ' t have a passed ball . But he did blow a play at first base last night , and he knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blew it. " // " I throw a fastball down the middle , and he calls it a ball , " Andujar said . " I try to talk to Darrell Porter about it , to ask him if it was inside or what , because it looked to me like it was down the middle . But the umpire jumped between us . When you ' re losing , 11-0 , you want to talk to the catcher. " // Herzog was ejected , and Andujar was waved back to the mound . Then he threw ball four to Sundberg , and this time he charged the plate and had to be held back by his teammates . Denkinger , the marked man , ordered Andujar out of the game . <> <> ' It ' s All Over for Us ' // " Hit him ? " Andujar said , when asked later if he would have struck the umpire . " I ' m in the major leagues 10 years , and you have to be some dumb son of a gun to hit an umpire . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World Series . Now , it ' s all over for us. " // " We all had some frustrating moments , " said Jack Clark , the cleanup hitter and leader of the Cardinals . " Joaquin had some particularly frustrating moments . We got burned on a play at first base last night , and everybody knows it. // " It cost us a game , and you can ' t just let it go . Just because it ' s the World Series , you can ' t just be nice and let them beat your brains out . Some ugly things happened out there tonight , and Joaquin let them know it . You can ' t let it go . " Before the debacle , Herzog spent the afternoon in the football stadium next to the baseball stadium in the sports complex here . He sat in the coaches ' box with George Brett of the Royals , watching the Kansas City Chiefs lose to the Denver Broncos . Then he walked next door to the baseball stadium , and told his Cardinals : // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one more , and you win the World Series . Win , and there ' s a parade at noon in St. Louis . Either way , there ' s a dinner tomorrow night in St. Louis . But whatever happens , happens. " // What happened stunned even Herzog , although he said before the game that he had a strong fear that losing the sixth game meant losing the seventh , with Tudor pitching and Denkinger calling balls and strikes. // After it was over , Herzog reflected on the evening ' s work. // " I really didn ' t mind being thrown out , " he said . " I had seen enough , anyway. " //
