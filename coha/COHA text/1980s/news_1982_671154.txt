But during the afternoon before that game , the huge silver chalice suddenly was nowhere to be found . " It ' s not funny , it ' s not funny , " groaned Lefty Reid , the Hall of Fame curator and the cup ' s custodian . " I knew I never should have let it out of my sight. " // Soon the Stanley Cup was found . In the confusion , it had been put in the back of a Devils equipment truck that had been driven to the rink in nearby Totowa , N.J. , where the team practices. // That night the Stanley Cup gleamed on display at Byrne Meadowlands Arena , a pot of silver at the end of the rainbow for the National Hockey League ' s newly relocated franchise. // Tonight , the Islanders , who have purchased condos at the end of that rainbow , skate into the Meadowlands for the first time ; Saturday night , the Devils visit the Nassau Coliseum. // " That ' s one great thing about the met area , " Glenn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was saying . " People really care how you do against your rivals like the Islanders and the Rangers . It ' s like a season inside the season. " // So far , the Islanders are dominating what might be described as the MiniMet season within the N.H.L. season . With two victories over the Rangers , the Islanders are 2-0 in the MiniMet season ; the Devils are 1-0 , having jarred the Rangers , 3-2 , at the Meadowlands in their second game ; the Rangers are 0-3. // A s the N.H.L. ' s best team , the Islanders surely should dominate their two neighborhood rivals . But if the Devils can hold their own against the Rangers , they will have had a semisuccessful season. // Over the 80-game schedule , each of these three Patrick Division teams will play the others a total of 14 games . Because of that format , and the resulting rivalry among three teams in the same area , the N.H.L. provides a rooting interest that no other major league has . With their Stanley Cup playoff duels in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the New York area needed , its only true rivalry. // In baseball , the Yankees never play the Mets ; in football , the Giants seldom play the Jets ; in basketball , the Knicks and the Nets do play each other , but their rivalry has yet to burst into flames. // Now the Devils have added a third dimension to the Islander-Ranger rivalry . That dimension will create a sellout crowd of 19 , 203 for the Islanders ' visit to the Meadowlands tonight , just as it did when the Rangers were ambushed there . For their five other home games , the Devils have averaged 11 , 869 , not bad considering the team ' s credentials in Colorado , though not good by Islander and Ranger attendance standards. // Another reason for the Devils ' rivalry with the Islanders is that so many people in the Devils ' organization were once in the Islander organization. // Eight of the Devils once played for the Islanders , beginning with Billy MacMillan , the general manager and coach , and Bert Marshall , the director of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islanders are Chico Resch , Garry Howatt , Bob Lorimer , Hector Marini , Steve Tambellini and Yvon Vautour . Another player , Dave Cameron , was obtained from the Islander farm system . Even the Devils ' trainer , Craig Smith , was formerly in the Islanders ' organization , working with the farm team at Indianapolis. // " Everybody ' s going to be up for the Islanders , " said Bob Lorimer , a defenseman for the 1980 and 1981 Stanley Cup champions . " The guys don ' t want to be embarrassed. " // With their 5-3 loss Tuesday to the Minnesota North Stars , the Devils are embarrassed enough , now that they ' ve lost three consecutive games for the first time since the franchise ' s transfer from the altitude of Colorado to the sea-level swamps of the Meadowlands. // " Let ' s face it , " said Bob MacMillan , a right wing and the coach ' s younger brother , " we ' re not the most talented team in the league. " // A gainst the North Stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed an unpardonable sin - allowing a goal with only one second remaining in the second period , after having scored to narrow the North Stars ' lead to 2-1 with only 12 seconds remaining . Chico Resch later took the rap for that goal. // " I should ' ve challenged the shooter , but there ' s no excuse for a goal like that , " he said . " In the last 12 seconds , you play it safe , you plug the slot. " // That , of course , is the refrain of a bad team , which the Colorado Rockies were last season . Only once in the eight-season history of the franchise , which originated as the Kansas City Scouts in 1974 , were the Devils ' ancestors in the playoffs . In the 1980 opening round , the Rockies were swept by the Philadelphia Flyers in two games. // " If we don ' t play well , we can lose to Detroit , " Chico Resch said of the Devils , " but if we play well , we can beat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devils have been shaky in the first period , being outscored by 12-11 and outshot by 112-80 . " We haven ' t come out of the chute that well , " Chico Resch said . " Like any underdog , if we can get the lead , it not only makes us think we can win , it also makes the other team think they can lose . But to me , the key to beating the Islanders is this : If you break past one of their defensemen , don ' t get anxious and shoot from the top of the circle . Skate in , take a good shot , complete the play like you would against any other team . Because they ' re so good , the Islanders get away with other teams being too anxious to score when an opportunity arises. " // But the fact that the Islanders are so good is what makes the MiniMet rivalries so meaningful. //
