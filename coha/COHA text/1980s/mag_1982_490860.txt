THE TALK . OF THE TOWN Notes and Comment WE have just received the fol- lowing communication from a young woman we know : It is about two o'clock in the afternoon of one of the coldest days of the winter , and I am sitting with a friend who had her first baby forty-eight hours ago . My friend is a beautiful young woman , a theatrical costumer , who never wears costumes herself but has the air of quiet health and the grave roundness of feature of a woman from another century . She , the baby , and I are seated  --  actually , she is half reclining with the baby  --  near the front windows of her fifth-floor loft in Chelsea . There is a big desk nearby , covered with meticulously arranged watercolors , inks , and pens , and in one corner stands a dressmaker 's dummy , whose neck holds five or six old-fashioned hats  --  straw , velvet , and felt . The baby is wide awake , lying half covered by a flannel blanket with tiny red rocking horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he wears only a diaper in the smallest , newborn size and a yellow plastic surgical clamp that looks like a clothespin on the section of his umbilical cord that has yet to dry up and fall away . His hands and feet are wrinkled like a long-distance swimmer 's , and his face has a look of extreme age . For the last few minutes , he has been staring in my direction , with eyes that are the odd bluish-black of a night sky about to become light ; I ca n't imagine what he sees , but his eyes are uncrossed and clear and wide , and are fixed on me wearily , as if he 'd known my type and got tired of it a hundred years ago . His mother chuckles when 1 make this observation . " He 'll get younger in the next few weeks , " she says . She smooths her son 's invisible eyebrows , looking down at him with the same gently bemused expression with which she used to look down at her expanding stomach , a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asks , and the question is a happy one . Frost spreads on the windows , and in the freezing sunlight out on Twentieth Street men wearing Air Force jackets and leather hats with earflaps are unloading a truck ; up the street , men are hauling bed frames for a wholesale furniture place near the corner , backing cars out of a garage , or hanging out in the J &; D Restaurant ( comidas , hamburguesas ) . Now National Public Radio has begun the Prelude to " Parsifal , " and I am struck by the different types of time I can observe , sitting where I am : there are the ambitious , doom-laden rhythms of the music ; there is the day of the men in the street , which is measured in eight-hour or ten-hour shifts , coffee breaks , and muscles contracting in the cold ; there is the beat I ca n't hear in the dance studio directly across from where we sit , to which the dancers ( turned into brownish silhouettes by sheets of plastic tacked over the windows against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there is the desultory pace of the mysterious business on the floor above the dance studio , where a young man lounges for hours in front of a telephone in an office from whose rafters hang net bags full of round dark objects ( bowler hats ? baskets ? coconuts ? ) ; and there is the cocoon in which this mother and baby are at pres ent existing , a dimension in which minutes can pass like years , and the conventional divisions of the day  --  work time , leisure ; darkness , light  --  are dissolved in the face of a passionate mutual absorption that eclipses the rest of the world . " Oh dear , life is such a chore for you ! " my friend remarks to her son , who is now lying on her lap and reaching out fretfully and desperately into the air , as if something there would solve all his problems if he could grab it . Under the sparse golden hairs on his head I can see a vein whose movement has been ticking off the short span of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and then asks me whether I 'd like to stay for the lunch her husband is fixing . I have to refuse , though I 'd like to stay for lunch and for much more than that , and soon I am back in my own frantic envelope of time , dashing through the cold to the I.R.T. at Eighteenth Street , with my scarf over my face , and wondering how many modest idylls are suspended on fifth floors around the city . ? ? Three Gatherings ABIG feed and assorted festivities were put on last week by the American Telephone &; Telegraph Company at Liichow 's , where the message  --  emblazoned on clumps of helium-filled white balloons , on buttons , on posters , on the aprons of dozens of waiters and bartenders , on souvenir gifts of T-shirts , ceramic cups , and highly polished brass-plated cases holding an Indian-head penny dated 1882 ? was " The Bell System Celebrates a Hundred Years of the Phone at Home . " Hosts : many jovial-mannered , three-piece-suited corporate types , handing out A.T . &; T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director-Marketing and Media Relations Manager and Vice-President-Residence Marketing . Guests : the press , big and little , general and trade ; television announcers , commercial and cable ; decorators and designers ; a lot of very thirsty and very hungry anonymous people , all putting on their heads another gift , little brown derbies , and chomping away with grim concentration . Guest of honor : Don Ameche , star of the 1939 movie " The Story of Alexander Graham Bell , " still thin , still tall , still with his Don Ameche mustache and his obliging good nature , and looking much younger than his age ( now seventy-three ) , wearing a light-gray suit , a white shirt , and a light-gray necktie with dark-gray squares and red dots , and gazing around with awe and admiration at a four-foot-long chocolate-and-vanilla layer cake in the shape of an 1882-model telephone , with an earpiece of licorice ; at a real antique popcorn wagon popping popcorn ; at Liichow 's famous gazebo , decorated with vines of real purple grapes and with exotic flowers and feathers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gazebo , wearing tails and playing music by Sigmund Romberg , Victor Herbert , Johann Strauss , and Irving Berlin ( " All alone , by the telephone ... " ) ; at pretty girls wearing long Victorian velvet dresses with bustles ; and at the chow tables , offering three-bean salad , baked ham with three kinds of mustard , cabbage-and- celery-seed slaw , apple-currant muf- fins , dame of Kennebec salmon , Cornish game hen with wild rice and pine-nut stuffing , roast tenderloin of beef , shrimp , oysters , clams , mussels , strawberry shortcake , and gingersnaps . " Don , it 's a very turn-of-the-century menu , " one of the corporate types said to Mr. Ameche . " Gosh , I had no idea , " Mr. Ameche said . " All this ! " " I saw your movie on television , " one of the Victorian-dressed girls said to Mr. Ameche . " It 's like ' The Story of Benjamin Franklin . ' Like that . " " Why , thank you , " Mr. Ameche said . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bell ? ' And I always say ' Yes ? ' " " ' Wings for the human voice , ' " another A.T . &; T. man said earnestly . " Don , did you see your poster ? " He drew Mr. Ameche 's attention to a wall poster showing various stills of Mr. Ameche as Mr. Bell , and read from it : " 20th Century-Fox presents Darryl F. Zanuck 's Production of ' The Story of Alexander Graham Bell , ' with Don Ameche , Loretta Young , Henry Fonda , Charles Coburn , Gene Lockhart , Spring Byington . America 's most thrilling story ! Thrilling ... and true ! Of love so great and faith so strong that it inspired this man to endure ridicule , privation , hunger .. to achieve the miracle of wings for the human voice ! " " That 's right , " Mr. Ameche said . " He wanted to give up working on the invention , he loved her so much . She was deaf . But she would n't let him give up the invention . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from now on , " said the A.T . &; T. man . " With the whole field now open to competition . " " What a cast that was ! " Mr. Ameche said . " Hank and Loretta and all those other good actors . " " Yeah , Don , " said the A.T . &; T. man . " And we ca n't let the public forget that we 're the ones that gave the real wings to the human voice . Did you see our display of telephones , Don ? " The display ; the standard 1882 phone , the first dial phone of 1919 , and models all the way up to the 1982 Touch-a-Matic and Big Button . " Design is important , " said the A.T . &; T. man . " These days , old is in , so we give them a new phone that bespeaks that turn-of-the-century era . Look at this model . A tiny rolltop desk . You roll it up , and inside  --  presto ! The Stowaway ! " Mr. Ameche looked affectionately at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the hungry people surrounding him . " I like people , " he told us. " 1 make any kind of sacrifice to make things nice . When they called me for this , of course I came . I enjoyed portraying Mr. Bell . We made the whole movie in thirty days  --  all on the lot . I saw Loretta three or four years ago , in California , where we both live . She looked wonderful . Loretta and Hank . It was always a joy to work with people like that . I enjoy working now , too . I did four weeks last summer in ' How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying , ' in Akron , Dayton , Columbus , and St. Louis . I did a Love Boat , ' with Martha Scott . Of course , I did n't have as much to do in Love Boat ' as I did as Mr. Bell . My own favorite movie , though , that I was in is ' Heaven Can Wait . ' " " How did you get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nickname Dom , which people thought was Don , " he said . " I was born Dominic Ameche . Papa 's name was A-m-i-c-i , but an attorney in Minnesota , where Papa worked in the iron mines , changed the spelling for him . I never changed Dominic officially , but Don is on everything , including my passport . Would you believe that I have six children , all good children , and not one is an actor ? " " No , " we said . A Bell executive drew Mr. Ameche away to be photographed for the press , wearing a Prince Albert coat while pretending to talk on the 1882-model phone . We waited at the gazebo , ate a few of the purple grapes from the vine , and met Joe Spallino , the violinist and leader of the tail-wearing trio in the gazebo , who told us that he was making an all-out effort for the A.T . &; T. party . " We normally wear tuxedos , " Mr. Spallino said . " But this is important . " Jack Hallock , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the party , urged us to eat more of the grapes from the gazebo . " Did you see the nosegays on all the tables ? " he asked us , " In 1882 , these were called tussie-mussies . Very Victorian . Very Bell . " Mr. Ameche posed obligingly at the 1882 telephone for a quarter of an hour , and then he was taken in hand by an A.T . &; T. vice-president ( Residence Marketing ) , who placed him at a microphone in the gazebo , introduced him , and pointed out to the guests that the first long-distance telephone call had been made from New York City to Boston . A representative from the Mayor 's office announced that Mayor Koch had proclaimed the day Home Telephone Day in New York City . A clip from the movie " The Story of Alexander Graham Bell " was then shown on video monitors set up at various points in Liichow 's . Don Ameche : " Ahoy ! Mr. Watson , " We had a hunch they 'd be perfect for each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking to you from Five Exeter Place . Mr. Watson , come here ! I want you ! " Henry Fonda ( seen dozing at his post in a nearby room , then suddenly awakened by the voice over the wire , and rushing in to Don Ameche ) : " It talks ! Mr. Bell , Mr. Bell , it talks ! I heard you ! I heard your z.Dice ! " Don Ameche and Henry Fonda hug each other and jump around in a dance . In the gazebo , Don Ameche looked very pleased . ? RECENTLY , a party was given for the unveiling of a piece of architectural sculpture called " Triad , " by Molly Burgess , which had been commissioned to enhance the northern facade of the American Thread Building , at 260 West Broadway , just south of Canal Street . At the party , which took place in an unfinished loft on the eleventh floor of the American Thread Building , we had an engrossing conversation with Melissa , Maura , and Valerie , students in the ninth grade at I.S. 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betsey Johnson ( Valerie : " I would have had mine first , but I did n't have the money , so Melissa did " ) , and their friend Adam , who is in the eighth grade and has a taste for punk rock . There was no electric light  --  only candles  --  so it was difficult to be sure which of the girls , dressed alike , as they were , said what . Adam : " Valerie 's mother works here , for the people who are developing the building , and she planned to bring Valerie , so Valerie invited Maura and Melissa , and they called me on the phone , and 1 asked if I could come , and Valerie asked her mom . I had to wear a tie , but I got to keep my combat boots . " " We hope we see Betsey Johnson . " " I do n't want to see her . I 'm embarrassed . I do n't want to see her with all of us wearing this dress . Like , if I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm only beautiful in the dark . " " I 'm never beautiful . " " If I lose at least ten pounds , I 'm going to be a super model . A photographer even told me so . " A man with a drink in his hand : " Why are you all wearing the same dress ? " " We 're sisters , and he 's our manager . " Adam ( adopting the sly tone of a manager or a press agent implying a story angle ) : " These kids are ' Gone with the Wind ' freaks . " " We all love ' Gone with the Wind , ' because Melissa looks like Vivien Leigh . " " That 's not the only reason we like it . It 's really a great movie . " Adam : " They never watch anything else . " " That 's not true . I watch soap operas . Only in the summer , though . I watch . ' Days of Our Lives ' then , because my stepmother does and there 's nothing else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I go to the Mudd Club all the time , and they do n't . I go to see punk rock . Well , not punk rock really . They call it hard core . " " Does n't Adam look like James Dean ? Kind of ? " Adam : " Would anyone like to know my favorite local hand ? Thank you . I like the Undead . " " We like the Police , and the Clash , and the Go-Go 's , and the Rolling Stones . " Adam : " All the bands they say , I ca n't stand . " " We all hang out at Valerie 's house . We watch ' Mister Rogers . ' " Adam : " Hey , guess what . Do you know about he Rocky Horror Picture Show ' at the Eighth Street Playhouse ? I do the lights . All the people who , like , go every weekend and have seen the movie hundreds of times act out the parts in the aisles and up front between the seats and the stage while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on them . I 'm telling you , it 's really important " " I got a ninety-six on my math . " Adam : " I got a thirty-five . " Our favorite drink is Coca-Cola . " " Oh , no . Adam 's going to dance . Do n't let him dance . He likes to slam-dance . Do n't , Adam . You 'll knock over a candle and there 'll be a fire . " " When I get through school , I 'm going to be a professional skier .

THE Smithsonian , it seems , likes to do things handsomely . Bagpipe music  --  from the Washington Scottish Pipe Band  --  accompanied a little procession , one Sunday afternoon , as a group in academic gowns and mortarboards marched across the Mall from the oId Smithsonian Institution Castle to the National Museum of Natural History , surprising and delighting various tourists , who probably thought this sort of thing a regular occurrence . Many of them enthusiastically photographed the marchers  --  scholars who were to take part in a symposium entitled How Humans Adapt : A Biocultural Odyssey . It was a. windy day of fitful weather . On arriving , the scholars filed into seats in the Baird Auditorium for the formal opening ceremonies . These were musical , too , though the bagpipes were now silent : a five-piece group called the Century Brass took over to give a cheerful rendition of Renaissance and Baroque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the platform , and when the music ceased , the Secretary of the Smithsonian , S. Dillon Ripley , rose to welcome the guests . He was succeeded by J. William Fulbright , former senator and a regent emeritus of the Institution , who , as the Washington Post later reported , " was garbed in a scarlet robe that a lay cardinal might wear . " Senator Fulbright introduced the keynote speaker of the occasion , Dr. Ren6 Dubos , of Rockefeller University . It was interesting to note , said Senator Fulbright , that the venerable Dr. Dubos received a Ph.D . at Rutgers University " during the now fashionable Administration of Calvin Coolidge . " Some of the foreign savants may not have got the joke , but they joined in the laughter anyway , so that we almost missed Fulbright 's throwaway line that followed : " I sometimes long for Calvin . " How Humans Adapt . We had received in the mail a poster depicting , in photographic black , white , and gray , a South American Indian shooting an arrow from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned , had been made by Napoleon Chagnon , a co-leader of Dr. James Neel 's expedition during one of his visits to the Yanomama Indians , of Venezuela and Brazil . Dr. Neel , at present the Lee R. Dice University Professor of Human Genetics at the University of Michigan Medical School , has made an intensive study of the Yanomama , which furnished the inspiration for developing this series of meetings  --  the Smithsonian 's seventh international symposium . During Dr. Dubos 's opening remarks , we looked at the list of people scheduled to discuss the question of human adaptation . Anthropologists . Psychiatrists . Biologists . Economists . Historians . Geneticists  --  lots of those . One theologian . Demographers , philosophers , nutritionists , sociologists .. How Humans Adapt . Dr. Dubos surprised us by saying that ready adaptation can be dangerous . Our species adapts to air pollution by physiological mechanisms that eventually result in chronic pulmonary disease . We adapt to a noisy environment by developing hearing impairment . Societies often respond to threatening situations with adaptations that are in the long run destructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not letting these dangers preoccupy us constantly , just as we keep out of our daily awareness the peril of protracted periods of youth unemployment , which are bound to lead to destructive social conflicts . But there is a brighter side to our behavior : we can adapt to the future . This may at first seem nonsense , said Dr. Dubos , but we often do adapt biologically to future situations , because our bodily and mental mechanisms can he activated by the processes of imagination . Merely thinking that we will have to run to keep an appointment or catch a train causes our hearts to beat faster and modifies some of our metabolic processes . We anticipate future challenges . Just so do societies anticipate the likely consequences of certain courses of action . Much of our contemporary gloom comes not from present situations but from the prospect of social and technological difficulties of the future which may never materialize . Dr. Duhos cited several threats we have anticipated and avoided . Anti-pollution programs , reforestation , environmental measures  --  all these , he said , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more fortunate than other animals , he reminded us , because they are the prisoners of irreversible Darwinian evolution , whereas we have freedom and the flexibility of social evolution , which is almost always reversible . We have been able to adapt socially to many ways of life : we have been members of roving bands , of sedentary villages , of towns , of cities , of religious or scholarly communities . Today , as in the past , many of us function as hunter-gatherers , pastoralists , farmers , sailors , artists , factory workers , scholars . Throughout our history , we have had the freedom to choose our course and have often been able to change direction , and even retrace our steps . " Life starts anew , for human beings , with each sunrise , " said Dr. Dubos , and on this upbeat note , at sunset , the scholars retired . Every day thereafter , the proceedings began at nine . The first paper was presented by Dr. Stephen Toulmin , of the University of Chicago , who was born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later studied philosophy at Cambridge University . His paper , he said , was entirely a question-raising paper . Its fundamental question was : Is it true that if the human species is to avoid disaster of some kind it must develop some new ways of adapting ? Formally replying to this was Dr. Mary Catherine Bate-son , Dean of Faculty at Amherst and also daughter of the late Dr. Margaret Mead . Dr. Bateson had lots to say . So did they all . It was talk , talk , talk , all day , some of it riveting but some rather hard to follow . This , for example : " My name is Wiercinski and I am from University of Warsaw . It seems to me that different modes of adaptation excellently reviewed by Dr. Toulmin may be integrated in one more general concept of adaptation of self-regulating systems . it stems from bipolarity of confrontation between goal-oriented potential for a developmental channel ... " Most of the symposium was easier going , though . Among the subjects discussed were " The Transition to Agriculture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ History in Relation to Human Adaptation , " and " Ethical Issues in the Human Future . " During a presentation on " Earth Resources and Population : An Archeological Perspective , " given by Professor Fekri A. Hassan , who was born in Cairo and is now associate professor of anthropology at Washington State University , there was a hint  --  just a hint  --  of scholarly malice . As Professor Hassan was commenting on some slides of pelvic bones which had been shown to demonstrate a point about population growth , Peter Laslett , of the Social Science Research Council , Cambridge University , asked sharply , " How many of those women had no children ? " " What time are we talking about ? " asked Dr. Hassan . " Well , what time are you talking about ? " Laslett demanded . " The Pleistocene , " said Dr. Hassan . " Well , how many children did they have ? " Laslett wanted to know . " Three per woman , or five ? " " Approximately three " was the reply . " Three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and three survive . The number that we have is varied , given that you have about fifty per cent or forty per cent child mortality ... " " WeE , we do n't have such good data on most of European history , " said Laslett , " and even where we do have figures , they are very dicey . I 'm just trying to get it straight in my mind  --  that we apparently know more about Neolithic fertility and survival than we do about recorded European history . This may be true . " The panel chairman hastily remarked that everybody could return to that subject later .
