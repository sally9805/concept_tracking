They claim to control one-fifth of El Salvador 's national territory . Their fighting strength continues to grow , from 8,000 combatants in 1982 to 10,000 today . In the past year they have killed some 1,800 members of the Salvadoran army and security forces , knocked out key bridges and caused more than $100 million worth of economic damage . On the basis of their destructive activity alone , the five guerrilla organizations that make up El Salvador 's Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( F.M.L.N. ) have shown that they are a potent national force . <P> Behind a showing of unity and strength , however , the Marxist-led F.M.L.N . has been troubled by periods of factionalism and by a jockeying for leadership that has occasionally resulted in murder .

By 1947 he had joined the illegal Salvadoran Communist Party , eventually becoming its general secretary . In 1970 he broke with the party . Fanatically secretive , he was the chief exponent of " prolonged popular warfare , " a hard-line strategy that would in his view probably culminate in direct confrontation with the U.S. Increasingly , it also conflicted with the view officially espoused by the other F.M.L.N . members , that the revolutionaries should negotiate a vague power-sharing agreement with the Salvadoran government .
