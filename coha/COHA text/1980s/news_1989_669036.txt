Chrysler Corp. said Monday that prices of its 1990 models will rise an average of 5 percent , or more than $700 , this fall . Chrysler ' s increase is 1. 6 percent , or $200 , higher than the 3. 4 percent , or $500 , General Motors Corp. increase announced last week . Chrysler is making airbags standard equipment on all of its 1990 cars and GM on only 15 models . Chrysler said $450 of its increase covers the cost of adding air bags to conform to the government mandate requiring passive restraints-airbags or automatic safety belts-in all vehicles . Chrysler said $450 only partially recovers the cost of airbags . GM said $140 of its $500 increase partially covered the cost of the bags . Chrysler also will raise freight charges an average of $15 per vehicle and will boost selected option prices but didn ' t detail what options would go up in price or by how much . Chrysler said dealer discounts won ' t be changed . GM said selected options will go up in price , too , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to the factory for their cars and have less of a cushion to deal with consumers . Chrysler said the increase allows dealers to start selling 1990 models though some 1989s still are in dealer stock . The extent of the ' 90 increase is expected to help clear out leftover ' 89s . The $700 average increase at Chrysler was arrived at after allowing for equipment changes , either making optional equipment standard or standard equipment optional for 1990 . Those allowances mask higher increases . Chrysler , for example , said the 1990 LeBaron coupe increases 3. 7 percent , or $449 , to $12 , 495 after equipment allowances that included making a V-6 engine , automatic transmission and power windows standard for 1990 . Those items were options in 1989 . Chrysler said the $449 represents the difference between the starting 1990 price of $12 , 495 and the $12 , 046 price on an 1989 if a customer had purchased those options . By juggling equipment like that , Chrysler masks an 8. 6 percent , or $1 , 000 , increase in the 1990 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1989 , the price before adding the options . As another example , Chrysler said the Premier ES goes up by 3. 7 percent , or $650 , for 1990 after equipment adjustments . Air conditioning , AM-FM stereo with cassette , power mirrors and rear seat shoulder belts that had been optional for 1989 are made standard for 1990 . The Premier ES goes up by 12. 5 percent , or $1 , 986 , to $17 , 845 from $15 , 859 in 1989 , the price without those items as standard . At the other extreme , the New Yorker Landau has been priced at $18 , 785 for 1990 , which Chrysler says is down by $724 , or 3. 7 percent , after equipment adjustments from $19 , 509 in 1989 . But the price was cut by making 1989 standard equipment optional for 1990 . Removed as standard were electronic instrumentation , power door locks , tilt steering wheel , power driver ' s seat and cruise control . The 1989 New Yorker Landau with those items as standard was priced at $18 , 232 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at $18 , 785 is $553 higher in price , not $724 lower . As for other pricing examples , Chrysler said after equipment adjustments the 1990 Dodge Caravan and Plymouth Voyager went up by $489 , or 4. 2 percent , to $11 , 995 for 1990 ; the Plymouth Acclaim goes up by $503 , or 4. 4 percent , to $11 , 815 ; the Dodge Omni and Plymouth Horizon by $400 , or 6 percent , to $6 , 995 ; and the Dodge Daytona Shelby by $631 , or 4. 6 percent , to $14 , 295 . Chrysler didn ' t elaborate on the adjustments , but said that without them , Caravan/Voyager went up by $683 ; Acclaim by $520 ; Omni/Horizon by $444 ; and the Daytona Shelby by $1 , 000.
