According to the creators of the videotape , we live in a world in which spectacle is used constantly to overwhelm social reality , serving the interest of power . The Establishment represents power , and it rules by false ideas as well as by armies. // To make these points , the videomakers juxtapose bits of film , TV commercials , and newsreels to prove their notion that most contemporary culture exists mainly to support the capitalist lust for power to the detriment of the little man .

Eighty percent of those surveyed indicated they would use public teletext service if it were permanently available . Almost 50 percent said they would buy a teletext-equipped set at a premium of $200 if it were offered when they next bought a TV set . Group W has also been conducting experiments with teletext in San Francisco which seem to indicate that there is definitely a market for the service. // //
