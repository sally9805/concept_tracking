Na book in our literature remains more alive than Walt Whitman 's Leaves of Grass . Most of us first meet it in the enormous " Deathbed Edition " of 1891 ; but the first edition of 1855 ( quoted here from a 1961 Viking paperback edited by Malcolm Cowley ) is the purest and most immediate expression of Whitman 's early genius . In its twelve poems Whitman displays , in one complex act , the double discovery of his sexual identity and its torrential equivalent in language . In the central moment of the hook , Whitman asks , " What is this flooding me , childhood or manhood .... and the hunger that crosses the bridge between . " The sexual flooding demanded a language supple with physical sensation ; the hunger for psychological authenticity demanded a language of self-analysis ; and the wish to cross more bridges , those connecting Whitman 's own manhood to other selves , demanded an unprecedented intimacy of address , a new voice of yearning . Even in solitude , the keenness of sexual sensation terrified him ; still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it : Precisely because he observed the world from a hidden position , one of furtive passion , Whit . man 's enormous efforts of perception and sympathy were silent , searching , and delicate ( no matter how inwardly impulsive , turbulent , and passionate ) . He consequently wrote about the world in a way half-open , half-secretive , revealing his subjects with apparent openness and frankness but at the same time inviting his reader to learn from him a quiet and unobtrusive perception . It is to Whitman 's instructions in perception and to his rich renderings of life ( at once so " democratic " and so concealing ) that I want to turn ; but I want first to sketch out the nature of the 1855 Leaves , mentioning along the way some aspects of the book others have singled out for praise . It was the watershed of sexual discovery , dividing the adult Whitman from the child Whitman , that enabled all the strengths we see in Leaves of Grass ? notably its extraordinary impress of ( invented ) personal selfhood , sympathy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Leaves of Grass , originally untitled but later named , contain " incomparable things said incomparably well , " as Emerson wrote to the then unknown Whitman . Emerson was able to guess that there had been a " long foreground " to Leaves of Grass largely because the book takes pains to describe that foreground : it gives evidence of a prolonged period of self-investigation and self-analysis , including many baffled passages into blind alleys . " The boy I love , " says Whitman in " Song of Myself , " " becomes a man not through derived power but in his own right " : he will be " wicked , rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear . " Whitman drew that lesson by giving up " derived power " and , insisting on fearlessness , learning to be " wicked " in his own choice of nonconformity . Not only learning the truth of his own identity ? " refreshing , wicked , real " ? but also learning to write out that truth for others , he could begin the greatest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two propositions , one expressive ? " I celebrate myself " ? and the other didactic ? " And what I assume you shall assume . " For Whitman , learning to be wicked was so linked to the letting out of semen ( as " Song of Myself " testifies ) that learning to speak " wickedness " took on sexual overtones : Speech is the twin of my vision .... It provokes me forever , It says sarcastically , Walt you understand enough .... why do n't you let it out then ? Whitman had invented his free verse by 1850 , but he had not yet invented himself . He still thought of himself as oppressed and victimized , mawkishly commiserating , in 1843 , with the condemned Jesus and with auctioned slaves as a way of protesting the Fugitive Slave law . His leap forward into authentic manhood can be seen in the passage on slavery in the 1855 poem " The Sleepers . " Here Whitman represents himself not as a passive victim but rather as a powerful male slave who , seeing his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vows a Luciferian revenge , threatening to become Leviathan and kill the slave owner : man for everyone , it is because Whitman made himself , programmatically and deliberately , into a poet for everyone . He pretended , for instance , to have visited parts of the United States that in fact he had never seen , and to have had experiences that he had not in fact had : " I am the man .... I suffered .... I was there . " Many of Whitman 's readers , from Garcia Lorca to Neruda , have read him politically , as the speaker for the oppressed . Whitman presented himself readily in this American role ; it was a genuine enough elaboration of his own self-defense as a poet and as a homosexual . Readers who seek in Whitman the poet of social protest find an authentic Whitman . But they do not find the primary one . The primary Whitman , psychologically speaking , is the Whitman who , at some point in his thirties , opened a new circuit between the energies of sensuality and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his identity . If the " unclenched floodgates " of autoeroticism confirmed him as a sexual being , homosexual experience ( both real and imagined ) gave him sexual identity , a very different matter . He then confronted ? with extraordinary equanimity , invention , and happiness ? the strange compositional problems set by his nature . Faced , for example , with the considerable aesthetic problem of representing fellatio in poetry , he found , in " The Sleepers , " a solution at once brilliant and beautiful , in the image of a feast : Since our cultural myth of " the best liquor afterward " is that of the wedding feast at Cana ? where , the New Testament tells us , Jesus turned water into wine we can appreciate Whitman 's metaphorical daring . We also can appreciate his dramatic sense , as he prefaces the delighted relief of the closing line with the original fearfulness of the virgin . " The white teeth stay " ? a reprieve ? but then , inexorably , the seduction resumes : " and the boss-tooth " ( its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness " until the liquor of ejaculation is spilled . This characteristic movement of fearful , if exhilarating , sexual exploration followed by the joy of physical and gestural expression is the pulse of the first Leaves of Grass . It is understandable that homosexual readers of Whitman have been as grateful for his candor as for his poetic invention . ( Whitman 's intoxicating cry against censorship ? " Unscrew the locks from the doors ! / Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs ! " ? becomes in our century the epigraph to Ginsberg 's " Howl . " ) But Whitman 's celebration of authenticity was meant to be ? and is ? available to everyone , not just to Americans , or to political revolutionaries , or to members of sexual minorities . There is a " coming out " to oneself in all emboldened inner declarations of identity . For Whitman , the divine moment in which one acknowledges one 's selfhood makes one a partner to all the young gods of creation . In a passage in " The Sleepers " representing that liberating moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in French ) with Whitman through the universe . This passage is the best expression in our literature of the disclosed joy , at once tentative and boisterous , of being at last , sexually , personally , and aesthetically , on the right path : When Whitman found himself able at last to pour out " mirthshouting music " ? " l sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world " he discovered , hoarded up within himself , all that his phenomenal attentiveness of eye and ear had ever registered , all that he had ever noted in his minutely categorizing mind . One reads the first Leaves nor only for the newly-made man but for the absorptive child he had been . The " long foreground " that preceded sexual expression and sexual identity had been for Whitman a time of incorporating the world through his senses ; and the 1855 Leaves includes the best poem in our literature about the sensuous , intellectual , and aesthetic formation of the child ? " There Was a Child Went Forth . " This poem should be read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young manhood . Yet it is only after reading the ecstatic worship of the newly-sexual body in " Song of Myself " that one can detect Whitman 's deliberate exclusion of the sexual in his homage to childhood . became a reader of Whitman through " There Was a Child Went Forth . " Deprived of Whitman in childhood ? first by the schooling I received ( which would have considered him indecent ) and later by my absorption in the poetry of England ? I found him , at , of all places , the School in Rose Valley , in Pennsylvania , where the remarkable headmistress , instead of addressing her audience of parents , recited aloud from memory " There Was a Child Went Forth , " and sat down without another word . Until then , I had known only the myth of Whitman ? that he was noisy , patriotic , crude , repetitive , formless . No one had told me that Whitman was curious , intellectual , troubled by " the doubts of daytime and the doubts of nighttime .... the curious whether and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was careful and truthful : Most of all , no one had told me but it was selfevident , in " There Was a Child " that Whit-man had invented an oceanic American rhythm unknown to English verse . The passages I have so far quoted do nor represent the Whitman who is a master of anecdote . The first Leaves is full of small narratives of suffering ? accounts of deaths , amputations , shipwrecks , hounded slaves ? retold with Keatsian infeeling . Whitman had discovered , perhaps from his newspaper reporting , that anecdotes could introduce large social reference into lyric ; this was his most original structural discovery . His expansive announcement , " I celebrate myself , " turned out to include the celebration of his whole social world : soldiers , ship captains , mothers , artisans , prostitutes , and animals ? all sketched in those miniature narratives that to the poet Muriel Rukeyser seemed prophetic of film scripts . Whitman 's brief lyric anecdotes are the foundation of his famous catalogues . In an opening anecdote , he sketches the category he intends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an immigrant wishing he could return home : After such an initial sketch , Whitman will begin the iterative catalogue : " In his dream the Dutchman voyages home .... I The Swiss foots it toward his hills .... / The Swede returns . " We are to compose in our own minds a vignette for each of these subsequent immigrants ? extending , for instance , Whitman 's single phrase " The Swiss foots it toward his hills " forward and backward to create an entire anecdote of the return to Switzerland , using the template of the Irishman 's dream of return to the Ireland of his youth . Whitman 's book is thus a handbook , training apprentices in a method of response . His catalogues are an invitation to us to " loafe and invite " our soul , as we co-create ( following the original model ) new anecdotes from his lists . Whitman insists that we do this in our own way , not in his . He will teach us the knack of it ( by sketching the first vignette for us ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , nor any one else can travel that road for you , You must travel it for yourself . Many readers have found in Whitman the strength to accede to a painful authenticity forbidden them by their parents or their society . Whitman 's apprehensive , ultimately liberating , acknowledgment of his homosexuality , his rebellious identity , and his aesthetic originality permitted him to command others , through his poetry , to comparable courage . As I have said earlier , if I were asked why I but the word " description " does not suggest aesthetic choice , while words like " treatment " and " rendering " do . Here , for instance , is how Whitman " renders " ad hoc shipboard surgery in the wake of a sea battle : The hiss of the surgeon 's knife and the gnawing teeth of his saw , The wheeze , the cluck , the swash of falling blood .... the short wild scream , the long dull tapering groan , These so .... these irretrievable . Once Whitman decided to " do " this scene as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiss , " " wheeze , " " cluck , " " swash , " " scream , " and " groan . " But the phrases " gnawing teeth " and " long dull tapering groan " mark points in the passage where one 's admiration for Whitman 's lexical plenitude gives way to wonder at the imagination that conceived of a saw 's teeth as avid and animal , that thought up ( in an aural context ) the visual " tapering " for the sound of a drawn-out groan . Another case of " rendering " : intoxicated with his power to take in , imaginatively , the whole earth , Whitman comically and ironically renders himself as the whole earth : To imagine , in 1855 , a view of the earth from outer space ; to see a round ball with quadrupeds and birds artistically ( and ridiculously ) stuck on and sticking out all over it ; to say " That is what I am " and to find this image humorous and appealing : this is what Whitman can do in two lines by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to close by quoting the most beautiful of all Whitman 's renderings in the 1855 Leaves , his unequaled representation of the body , treated in a liturgy of worship . ( Each phrase of rendering in this passage is followed by a phrase of ritual veneration , the verbal equivalent of a salaam ? " It shall be you . " ) Behind this extended imagining of the self , there must lie a long reflection on the body and on its visual and kinesthetic correspondence to the natural world . How to render the pelvis and the shoulder blades ? they are " ledges and rests . " How to render the penis ? it is like a plowshare , going ahead into a furrow . How to imagine semen ? well , it is milky in appearance , and one could , after all , liken the action of masturbation to the action of stripping a cow 's udder of its milk . ( Whitman was willing to be curious in comparison to the point of grotesquerie . ) How to imagine urine ? like maple sap trickling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eggs . The penis ( in another aspect ) , so shy and yet so quickly aroused ? a " timorous pond-snipe . " In his thirties , writing this passage , Whitman , aware of a new relation with his own body ? its desires , its shape , its effluents ? could find nothing more worthy of worship and of expression . This early bodily faith is the faith of the whole 1855 Leaves , voiced in Whitman 's cry , " 0 love and summer ! you are in the dreams and in me . " For readers who admire not only Whitman 's themes but his renderings , I offer , then , his celebratory hymn to the human body , as he intertwines it with the body of the world and the other mortal bodies it touches during its lifetime : Whatever Whitman may have owed to Emerson , he did not owe this supreme tenderness toward natural biological being . Later , the Civil War and his own paralysis would force Whitman toward a sorrow that broke this faith in the body ; but his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many genuine later poems . The moment of awakening genius that produced the 1855 Leaves of Grass was a fragile one , but that fragility does not diminish its unbridled joy and passionate candor . The troubled underside of that joy , visible in Whitman 's doubts of daytime and doubts of nighttime , only redoubles our sense of the strenuous courage of Whitman 's self-analysis . His discovery of unforgettable rhythms and words for the joys and the doubts alike remains inexplicable ; not even Whitman fully understood how the child who went forth became , in 1855 , the man who wrote poems .
