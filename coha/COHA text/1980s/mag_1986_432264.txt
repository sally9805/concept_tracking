 | On a raw January day in 1983 I met with a group of my fellow employees in Tewksbury , Mass . We were all angry . For the past two months we had been humiliated at our jobs and our complaints to our employer had been ignored . Now , we agreed , we were ready to do more than just complain . The ordeal began in the spring of 1982 , when I was working as a part-time waitress in the lounge of the local Holiday Inn . One day management told us that , as part of an overall plan to update the Inn the following fall , we would be getting new uniforms . At the time , all female lounge employees wore black skirts or slacks with white blouses . When our manager asked for our input on the new uniforms , we decided that culottes would be good ? easy to work in and flattering to our range of figure types . But central management in Cleveland wanted to duplicate the success they had had renovating another Holiday Inn in Ohio ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bar . Waitresses in that lounge wore hotpants . Rumors began to spread that hotpants had also been ordered for us but none of us believed it . Then , in October , we were shown our new uniforms : hotpants ? brown polyester shorts so skimpy the inseam measured just one inch ! They were to be fitted on us in time for the grand opening of the lounge , Thanksgiving Day , 1982 . How could our employers expect us to wear such outfits ? Did n't they realize how humiliating hotpants would be for the women , especially the older women working in the lounge ? I wondered how Kitty Gillis ,  | who was out on medical disability at the time the new uniforms arrived , would react . A 56-year-old grandmother . Kitty had been working as a bartender in the lounge for the past 10 years and planned to return to her job as soon as her health permitted . Another bartender , Barbara Gorski , 46 , had just returned from a 25th wedding anniversary cruise with her husband . She had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older women who were upset . All of us ? Linda Parks , 35 ; Maureen Judd. 31 : Monique Brand , 25 ; and I ( also 25 ) ? were equally indignant , especially when we were handed the shorts and told to model the new uniform for management ! We voiced our objections swiftly and unanimously : We did n't want to wear the shorts . The rest of the uniform ? the Aunt Charlotte 's blouse , with suspenders and a bow tie ? was fine . Management 's response was definite : Wear the new uniform or find another job . We did n't want to leave our jobs ; we could n't afford to . Linda was dependent on her job at the Inn to support her three teenage children . Maureen worked as a part-time waitress to supplement the income from her other fulltime job . It was her dream to send her young son to private school . Barbara , who worked at the lounge to supplement her husband 's income , was saving for her sons ' college tuitions . Monique. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a home for her family of five . Kitty lived alone and was completely dependent on her job for income . I worked at the Inn part-time while working full-time at a weekly newspaper . Jobs that tit my schedule were hard to find . and I needed my paycheck . We all did . So starting on November 29 , 1982 , we swallowed our pride and donned the new uniform . The hotpants were so short that most of ' us had to snip off the shirttails from our blouses so they would n't hang below the shorts ! I took a deep breath to steady my nerves . So did the others . But from the first moment we stepped into the lounge wearing the new hotpants , we had to endure a barrage of degrading comments , hoots , and whistles from the largely all-male crowd . The abuse became physical at times ? patrons pinched or grabbed us . Some customers propositioned the women . then acted surprised at their angry response . Just doing our regular tasks ? bending over to dig into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning across a table to reach for an empty glass ? made us feel as if we were exposing ourselves . 13y the end of the first week all of us were so disgusted we complained to the newly hired lounge manager . He told us not to confront offending patrons directly but to bring our complaints to him or one of the bouncers . And over the next few weeks we tried , but not much changed . When one of the waitresses sought help from a bouncer after a customer tried to " paw " her , he did tell the customer to " cool it . " But when the man persisted . the bouncer refused to intervene again . Again we approached the lounge manager . but instead of blaming the hotpants for our problems , he blamed us. hinting that we were either insecure or " puritanical . ' ' The message was : If you do n't like the shorts , get a new job . His threat had a particularly ominous ring to it , especially for Barbara and Linda . the eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We remembered a memo , circulated the previous summer outlining the entire renovation , had included a section on personnel policies : Lounge employees should be " young , attractive females with hip personalities . " it said . And of the more than two dozen new employees who were hired during the six-week grandopening promotion . almost every one was an attractive college-age woman . Then . shortly after the last event of the grand promotion ? a New Year 's Eve finale ? Barbara was fired . Asking for an explanation , she was told she had been observed overpouring drinks , and  | a report to this effect had been filed in September 1982 . The manager used that same report as a basis for firing Linda a week later , saying she had been serving free drinks . We all knew a Holiday Inn personnel policy states that an employee is entitled to three written warnings before being dismissed . Neither woman had received any warning about that " report . " We felt Barbara and Linda had been kept on to help train the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were shown the door . " I felt it was age discrimination , pure and simple , " said Linda . All of us were furious . But while we felt that what had happened to Barbara and Linda was unfair , until we began exploring our rights , we did not know it might have been illegal too . Our quest for legal redress began in mid-January 1983 . The firings , our frustrating working conditions , and our fury at the refusal of management to deal with our complaints led us to call a meeting at Barbara 's house to explore what we could do . Assigning ourselves different tasks ? Monique was to contact the state labor board , I was to call some antidiscrimination groups , and Linda was to write the president of the Holiday Inn ? we left the meeting in high spirits . But a few weeks later our optimism had evaporated . The state and federal labor boards told us they were not responsible for discrimination and harassment issues . Representatives of the hotel and restaurant unions suggested we try to organize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ negotiated contract . Perhaps the most disappointing reply came from the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination ( MCAD ) . When 1 explained our situation to a representative , she replied , " We do n't handle dress codes . " After I explained the age issue , she told me that only Barbara was eligible to file an action , since age complaints can only be filed by people between the ages of 40 and 70 . Nearly two months had passed by then and we were all getting more frustrated . We began to consider hiring an attorney to file a class-action suit , but none of us could afford to pay legal fees . Finally , a breakthrough came in early March when I contacted the Boston chapter of the National Organization of Women ( NOW ) who gave me a referral list of attorneys sympathetic to women 's issues . From that list we found Judith Ashton , a Boston lawyer who offered us our first glimmer of hope . It sounded as if we had a very good case , she told us in a telephone interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rosensweig , an attorney more conveniently located in Lowell . But Judy Ashton 's optimism was n't enough to counter the effects of working at the lounge . Monique reached the end of her rope in mid-March and quit . " The harassment just got to be too much , " she said . " Customers were passing their keys over the bar and asking me back to their rooms . " In late March , Monique , Maureen , and I met with Carol Rosensweig and spelled out all our complaints with the Holiday Inn . She was positive we could get legal redress . And , to our great relief , she thought the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ( EEOC ) would be able to handle our case without its costing us any money . EEOC was one agency we had n't contacted , simply because it is the federal version of the MCAD . Considering our lack of success with the MCAD , we figured it would be a waste of time . Carol Rosensweig got us the necessary forms from the EEOC , and on April 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill them out . We also got affidavits from other Holiday Inn employees substantiating our story , but unfortunately these women did not join us in filing a complaint . Nor did Barbara and Linda , who were too discouraged after the months of stonewalling to take action . Shortly after , Maureen , Monique , and I filed our complaints with the EEOC . Then we had to wait to hear if they would accept our case . In the meantime , working at the lounge was  | not getting any easier , even though we again had a new lounge manager . In April a customer grabbed my thigh as I passed his table . He did the same thing to Maureen . I had had it . On my next shift I replaced the shorts with a kneelength brown skirt . I told the lounge manager I was no longer willing to wear the hotpants because of the harassment they caused . He told me I was being insubordinate and , after consulting the general manager , fired me . It was the first time in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet I felt wonderful ! In early May good news came from EEOC ? they had accepted our case . We next met with EEOC lawyers , who explained that under the 1964 Civil Rights Act an employer is legally bound to prevent and protect its employees from sexual harassment . Rather than preventing sexual harassment , we felt our employer had been encouraging it . In May 1983 our discrimination and harassment complaint was formally filed with the U.S. District Court of Boston . Judy Ashton and Carol Rosensweig offered to represent us in conjunction with the battery of lawyers from the EEOC . It was funny ? at first we could n't get anyone to give us the legal time of day , and now we had a whole coalition of lawyers representing us . ( Even MCAD eventually filed a companion suit in support of our suit and admitted they should have been able to help us when we first contacted the agency . ) Judy and Carol also filed a suit on our behalf in state court asking for damages of $1 million . A hearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotpants requirement ? was scheduled for July 26 . Once news of the impending hearing leaked out , television , radio , and print journalists were asking us for interviews and appearances . We were more than happy to tell our story . And then the hearing took place . Some of our co-workers , including Linda and Barbara , came to lend moral support . In front of us sat our contingent of lawyers , behind us , clusters of reporters . All of us felt intimidated by the crowds and the austere atmosphere of the Boston courthouse . And we had concerns about the case itself : Would the hotpants issue be dismissed merely as a matter of " poor judgment " on the part of our employers , or could we prove real harassment ? Our worries were over when the attorney for the Inn said the uniforms were chosen specifically because they enhanced the " seductive atmosphere " of the newly renovated lounge and further added that we were hired , not as waitresses and bartenders , but as " part of an entertainment package . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rya Zobel . First , she dismissed the contention that we were hired as anything but waitresses and bartenders . Then , admonishing the Inn 's attorney for his client 's attempt to exploit the bodies of its employees , she issued a temporary injunction against the hotpants . All lounge employees were to be given the choice of wearing the shorts or slacks or skirts . Judge Zobel also ordered Monique and me to be reinstated to our old jobs immediately . We felt great ? but the battle was not yet over . Since Linda and Barbara had not yet joined the suit , they were not offered their jobs back . Four days later they filed their own complaints with the EEOC against the Inn , citing sex discrimination , sexual harassment , and adding the charge of age discrimination . They also joined our suit for damages . Our case continued for another 18 months , with Kitty joining the suit in February 1984 . In the meantime , Monique and Maureen had returned to work at the lounge wearing slacks . I did not go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better paying job with another newspaper and no longer needed a parttime position . The lawyers for all sides were busy . trying to work out a settlement so we would n't have to invest the time and money in a trial . But there were several interests to be reconciled here : The EEOC wanted to be sure the discriminatory personnel policies were reversed , our attorneys wanted to make sure we were monetarily compensated for our ordeal , and the Holiday Inn wanted to get us out of its hair . Finally , in February 1985 , more than two years after we first had to don hotpants , our case was resolved in an outof-court settlement . In it all six of us received a monetary award for damages ( the terms of the agreement prevent us from publishing the actual amounts ) . Also , the Holiday Inn agreed to adopt a nondiscriminatory employment policy and to drop its requirement that female lounge employees wear hotpants . While the agreement included a section stipulating that the Inn accepted no blame nor acknowledgment of any guilt of wrongdoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been a year since that victorious day . Those of us who wanted to continue working at the lounge did so . Also , the money from the settlement has helped us to begin to fulfill our dreams ? of travel , new homes , education for our children . But most important , we have gained the respect we were due . And through the ordeal we regained our self-respect as well .
