The Presidency <P> There is a new American view of the world that is struggling to be born . " If dtente is in limbo , " asked one of the President 's men last week , " what is going to take its place ? " " We are forging a new method of response to the Soviets , " suggested another key Carter planner . " Until now , responses have been mostly military . This will be much more political , cultural and economic . " <P> What encourages such expansive and philosophical ruminations is that the world seems to be tilting ever so slightly , for a change , toward the U.S. There have been mistakes , hesitations and excesses by almost everyone in these past few months of crisis . That is not , however , an uncommon condition for a vigorous democracy . Out of the confusion at last comes the faintest suggestion of a coherent and effective force against the terrorism in Iran and the Soviet aggression in Afghanistan . Bit by painful bit , sometimes because of Jimmy Carter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the U.S. , though often appearing puny by themselves , are beginning to take on heft . Access to more bases near the Persian Gulf , a floating contingent of Marines , increased aid to friends and more of everything to follow-all this makes an unmistakable footprint over there . Draft registration , talk of war , so deplored by some , are nevertheless a measure of seriousness . The Olympic boycott , which eventually may not win very many actual backers among other nations , has elevated concern about Soviet aggression in almost every part of the world . New courage to speak out is manifest in many countries because the U.S. has held steady this time . A unity born of crisis is enhancing , be it ever so slightly , American prestige and presidential impact . <P> " Three years of experience in this office is inevitably going to pay off , " says Jimmy Carter himself . He knows whom to consult on what within this country , which foreign leaders want to be led or consulted or pampered . " We know better how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And this skill has helped him to be increasingly persistent and consistent in policy . Carter feels that Congress now better comprehends the challenges . " The leaks are down , " he says-no small aid in national security planning . That yields a freedom of thought and discussion backstage that steadies policy . The support of the U.S. people has been like a surge of new power for the White House , and the President believes that it has helped America 's cause in the United Nations , particularly in the Islamic countries and the nonaligned world . <P> Carter can be forgiven a little pride . " The staunchness of our position has been an anchor , " he declares . " It has given others time to build up their positions . " He sees now the possibility of long-range impact in world opinion against any other extensions of Soviet power . <P> Carter has increased his private correspondence with the other world leaders . He has sent off secret messages to 120 nations about the Olympic boycott . Now there is a discernible shift to our side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
