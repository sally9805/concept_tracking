The noxious cloud hanging over Imhausen-Chemie keeps growing thicker . Under fire for its alleged complicity in the building of a poison-gas factory in Libya , the West German chemical company is besieged by criticism from its own employees , who fear their jobs will be lost unless President Jurgen Hippenstiel-Imhausen resigns . Two weeks ago Imhausen 's second-in-command took a drug overdose in an apparent suicide attempt . Now comes news that the firm is involved in the illegal production and sale of MDMA , a designer drug commonly known as " ecstasy . " <P> German prosecutors say Imhausen has supplied U.S. drug traffickers with 374 lbs . of MDMA , worth up to $27 million on the street . Two Americans and one Imhausen employee have been arrested . While Imhausen has admitted manufacturing the drug , company officials claim they were unaware the substance was illegal . Ironically , Imhausen could face stiffer penalties if convicted of breaking local narcotics laws than for helping a foreign country make deadly chemical weapons .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
