The impersonal inevitability of the biennial ritual makes it virtually impossible to like or dislike this exhibition strongly . Like Mount Everest , it is simply there . Given the size of the art scene and the complexity of the Whitney ' s constituency , the Biennial is an impossible task for its organizers . ( They are , once again , Richard Armstrong , Richard Marshall and Lisa Phillips , with John G. Hanhardt choosing the artists in the film and video section . ) To its audience , it offers an essential if partial view of the current scene - the Whitney ' s version of what matters most in recent art - and the museum ' s latest thoughts on its best-known endeavor , the Biennial itself. // This year ' s Biennial is a perplexing , frustrating affair , alternately admirable and faint-hearted . It may finally be most significant as an attempt to play down the Biennial ' s influence as tastemaker , but it also bypasses some opportunities for leadership. // Unusually egalitarian in the distribution of its favors , the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and a high number of artists who have worked for years without substantial recognition . It seems less indebted to the dictates of a few powerful galleries than in years past . It doesn ' t skimp on its enthusiasm for what might be called the Neo-Minimalist revival , and is loaded with work that the general public might find accessible only after consulting wall labels or the catalogue. // But the show also has a bland , middle-of-the-road tone . In certain parts , it evokes the airy , unfounded optimism of a Presidential press conference ; at nearly every turn , it communicates a heart-felt professional competence and predictability that makes you uneasy . Almost all the artists included here deserve the exhibition ' s blessing , but did they all have to be blessed at once , this year ? Couldn ' t the mixture have been balanced a bit more toward a riskier , edgier overview ? And it may not be relevant , but why are nearly all of the artists over 30 and under 50 ? It ' s hard to believe , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most challenging and provocative American art made over the past two years. " // The show begins quietly and modestly on the fourth floor with the careful , and relatively unknown , geometric-organic abstractions of Andrew Spence paired with Joel Shapiro ' s stripped-down , subtly figurative balancing acts of form . It proceeds evenhandedly , showing itself to be as receptive to sculpture as to painting , to depictions of landscape as to the stringencies of abstraction . It accommodates a certain amount of installation work alongside more traditional portable art objects and a smidgen ( but only that ) of politically inclined art , most notably installations by Chris Burden and Francesc Torres. // Mr. Burden ' s " All the Submarines of the United States of America " comments on military budgets and brawn by suspending hundreds of tiny model boats from the ceiling like a school of fish . Mr. Torres ' s " Oikonomos " ( Greek for economics ) uses a full-sized copy of a famous Greek statue of Zeus , armed with a baseball bat instead of the usual spear , and flanked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast between different struggles for survival , Manhattan-style. // In characteristic Biennial form , the ineffable winds of consensus are alternately acknowledged and ignored . The show includes the kitschy porcelain and polychrome wood sculptures of Jeff Koons , who had perhaps the most talked about gallery show of the season , but it omits the collaborative collages of Tim Rollins and K.O.S. , whose work has also been subject to widespread attention . On the other hand , it deems worthy of inclusion the derivative Neo-Expressionist paintings of Ray Smith. // For the most part , sculpture outshines painting in this gathering , with Saint Clair Cemin ' s bronze and plaster conflations of animal and furniture forms and Robert Gober ' s gently perverse rehabilitations of Americana being particularly impressive . Among the paintings , Brice Marden ' s linear networks , full of slow-motion twists and hairpin curves , exude an unforced confidence in the ways of the hand and the future of abstraction. // Christopher Wool ' s punchy word-images , especially the broken syntax of the work titled " Apocalypse Now , " have a refeshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuffed animal assemblages ; grouped with the more complacent efforts of Christopher MacDonald and Donald Baechler in a gallery that will probably be dubbed " the kids ' room , " they put a new spin on the enfant terrible tradition. // But if the Whitney is trying to defuse some of its power , it also shirks certain responsibilites by gingerly sidestepping any potential controversies . Despite the high number of women , there is almost no work that qualifies as feminist , as there has been in years past . Photography , listed in the catalogue ' s frontispiece along with painting and sculpture , is all but excluded . Especially amazing is the lack of any large-scale photographic work , like Barbara Kruger ' s , through which many artists have questioned society ' s effect on the individual . In this area , the unusually accessible efforts of Louise Lawler , which unravel the conventions of museum display , deserve inclusion. // Equally telling is the absence of any art that deals explicitly with the tragedy of AIDS , whose devastating effects , both personal and cultural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The specter of AIDS could have been acknowledged in several ways - from including individual artworks or collaborative installations that take AIDS as their subject to simply listing , either in the show or the catalogue , the artists who have died of the virus over the past two years. // Undoubtedly , any action would have brought objections from one faction or another , but for such a broad and diverse survey to ignore such a salient fact of late-20th-century life verges on a subtle form of censorship . It goes without saying that any such acknowledgement would also have given the exhibition a greater sense of connection to the real world. // Too often , the reality that gets the most attention in this exhibition is peculiarly physical . This is the Biennial in which appropriation went sincere , shifting away from the ironic use of manufactured goods and popular culture images and toward the irony-free deployment of organic materials , the more eccentric the better. // Among the Neo-Minimalists , Liz Larner makes a strangely regular tapestry out of human eyelashes . The team of Kate Ericson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Webster makes a big low-lying circle out of nothing but dirt ; a second sculpture populates soil with plants , stones and running water . There ' s a feeling in this work - some of which is quite affecting - that you can go home again , and that home is the early 1970 ' s. // In this regard , and in others , the new works of Sherrie Levine , ensconced high on a prominent wall on the Whitney ' s fourth floor , are pertinent . They aren ' t her best paintings , but their identical image , taken from George Hermann ' s " Krazy Kat , " gains force in this context . It depicts an ostrich with his head characteristically out of sight , stuck not in sand but in a bucket on wheels , guaranteeing a permanent yet mobile state of oblivion - a fitting symbol for the entire exhibition. // The 1989 Biennial Exhibition remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art , 945 Madison Avenue , at 75th Street , through July 16 . <> <> ' Pierre Bonnard : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery <> 41 East 78th Street <> Through May 6 // Small in size but rich in impact , these 16 sketchbook drawings by Pierre Bonnard were published in a 1947 issue of Verve devoted to his work . They depict the sights around and within Le Cannet , his residence in southern France , and have never before been exhibited. // It is obvious that many were worked on over a period of several years , as if Bonnard had infinite faith in both the power of the little drawing and in the durability of his paper . Their materials shift form by form and layer by layer from pencil , to colored pencil , to pastel to crayon to gouache ; their lines and textures build , often culminating in a quiet agitation that remains more muffled in the artist ' s works on canvas . One of the best , " The Village , " is creased , as if Bonnard were in the habit of folding it into his pocket while he walked out to consider the deep green vista captured on its surface. // The loose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist designed for Verve , reminiscent of Cy Twombly ' s work , is an additional and unexpected pleasure. //
