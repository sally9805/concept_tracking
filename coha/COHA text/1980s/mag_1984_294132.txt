Meese runs the gauntlet toward confirmation <P> The witness had five weeks to prepare for the hearings . He had made courtesy calls on his most hostile senatorial inquisitors . Thus , through two days of questioning on his fitness to be Attorney General , Edwin Meese last week remained cool , articulate and unsurprised by the questions of critical Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee . Barring some bombshell disclosure in the continued hearings this week , Ronald Reagan 's longtime aide will almost surely win Senate confirmation to replace the resigning William French Smith . <P> Still , there were some things that Meese could not credibly explain away . He admitted he had not paid a penny of interest over 20 months on $60,000 in unsecured loans from a trust headed by John McKean , a California accountant he barely knew . While insisting there was no connection , Meese began repayment only after the Washington Post ran a story on the curious transaction . Under grilling by his chief antagonist , Ohio Democrat Howard Metzenbaum , Meese conceded that he had never even asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Meese was satisfied with McKean 's integrity , he said , since McKean was the personal accountant for another top White House aide , Michael Deaver . Deaver had borrowed some $58,000 from the same trust . <P> Metzenbaum remained skeptical of Meese 's insistence that the loans had nothing to do with McKean 's selection on July 31 , 1981 , to become a member of the Postal Service board of governors . McKean had not been on a formal list of candidates for the part-time position when Meese , Deaver , Chief of Staff James Baker and Personnel Director E. Pendleton James met to recommend board members . Deaver suggested McKean , Meese concurred , and McKean got the job , which pays $10,000 a year . Metzenbaum asked why Meese had not told Baker and James , as well as the President , that he was indebted to McKean . Replied Meese : " The idea there was any connection between the loan and the recommendation by Mr. Deaver of Mr. McKean was so far from my thoughts that it never occurred to me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues affecting civil rights , women and the poor " a disgrace " and charged that Meese was " a key architect " of these policies . Kennedy tried to pinpoint Meese 's role in the controversial 1982 Justice Department decision to reverse more than a decade of federal antidiscrimination policy and permit Bob Jones University of Greenville , S.C. , to gain tax-exempt status , although the private school had a policy of racial segregation . In the outcry after the turnabout , Reagan claimed unpersuasively that he had merely wanted to make certain that the Internal Revenue Service had the right to withdraw the tax exemption-a power that few legal scholars had ever doubted . Last week Meese blandly denied urging the Justice Department to change its antidiscrimination position and contended that he too had been concerned only with clarifying the authority of the IRS . Asked Democratic Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware : " Do you believe that schools that discriminate on the basis of race should be tax exempt ? " Replied Meese : " Absolutely not .
