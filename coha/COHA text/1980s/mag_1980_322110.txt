Republicans make gains , but the Democrats still rule the roost <P> Even in years of presidential landslides , members of the House of Representatives who run for re-election usually win . Their success rate is more than 90% , compared with the more hazardous 68% success rate of their Senate colleagues . This year the powers of incumbency were sorely strained by the surprising Reagan-slide , the Abscam bribery scandal and the harrowing problems of inflation . The Democrats , nevertheless , hung on to control . Although at least 26 incumbent Democrats were defeated , and the Republicans had a net gain of 32 seats , the final breakdown of the 97th Congress will be about 245 Democrats and 190 Republicans . <P> The fallen Democrats included several of the chamber 's most powerful leaders and esteemed veterans , who fell partly because Ronald Reagan proved to have unexpectedly broad coattails , and partly because so many voters were in such a **28;5644;TOOLONG frame of mind that they did not hesitate to extend their anti-Carter ire to Democratic Congressmen . Lamented House Speaker Tip O'Neill : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> The Republican leaders were elated by their gains . Said Michigan 's Guy Vander Jagt , who as chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee was partly responsible for the G.O.P. House election strategy : " It 's the most crushing rejection of a President and his party in Congress since Herbert Hoover . Democratic leaders who managed to survive had the bejesus scared out of them . " <P> The Democrats ' tattered majority will be a meager bulwark against a Republican Administration and a Republican-controlled Senate that probably will be intent on dismantling major elements of the social legislation passed during the Democrats ' nearly half-century of dominance in both the House and Senate . In addition , the Democratic majority has turned more conservative . Most of the Republican newcomers are on their party 's right wing , and most of the Democrats who survived did so only by shifting during the campaign away from the Big Government liberalism that was clearly in disfavor on Election Day . Indeed O'Neill could become a classic political anachronism-the liberal Speaker of the House , crying the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fall of the Mighty . Until this year , the House leaders on both sides of the aisle have had an unspoken agreement that they would not try to unseat each other . But this summer Vander Jagt met with other Republicans and decided to break with tradition by mounting stiff challenges to high-ranking Democrats . It worked .
