And then , of course , there are the Snook Bluejays. // This tiny farming and ranching community in the Brazos River bottoms of east-central Texas is not exactly quintessential basketball territory . And Snook ' s games against small-town Texas schools like Dime Box and Apple Springs will never be confused with big-time basketball. // // Record Is Enviable // But Snook , where enrollment has fluctuated between 120 and 150 students in recent years , has compiled a basketball record that ranks with the greatest powers at any level of the game. // " I say this in a very sincere and humble way , but it would be very hard to find anyone with an overall record that compares to ours , " said Donnie Victorick , the basketball coach and elementary school principal in this town of around 480. // Between 1978 and 1984 , the team won seven consecutive Class A state championships , playing against other small schools . The streak was one short of the national high school basketball record set by Northfork High School of West Virginia from 1974 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , Snookites everywhere went into a state of shock. 90-Game Streak The school also has the fifth-longest high school basketball winning streak on record , 90 victories in a row from 1964 to 1966. // Since 1960 , the team has compiled a 981-162 record , winning almost 86 percent of its regular-season and playoff games . Virtually all of its losses have come against schools several times its size. // " It gets a little hard on us , " said Edward Macik , a 6-foot senior forward . " If we win , it ' s just another win . If we lose , it gets big headlines. " // The school district , which includes about 1 , 500 residents in Snook and such neighboring hamlets as Clay , Tunis and Center Line , does not look much like a basketball hotbed. // The flat , black farmland surrounding the town supports farms raising cotton , milo and corn. // The town , located on a farm-to-market road about 100 miles northwest of Houston , includes the First Bank of Snook , two Czechoslovak bakeries , Slovacek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen other businesses , many of them catering to farmers. // It doesn ' t have much to do with either inner-city blacktop courts or the traditional rural basketball strongholds of Indiana or Kentucky. // But if Snook isn ' t natural basketball country , it has developed a tradition that has turned it into a town that lives basketball all year round . <> <> Everyone Wants to Play // " This town is very basketball oriented , " said Carol Whitten , whose family operates a crop-dusting company and whose son Beau is a 5-foot-9-inch junior guard . " All these kids just grow up thinking they want to play basketball for Snook. " // At least a third of the men in town are former Snook players . But basketball hasn ' t always been king at Snook . Many of the adults in town either played on or can remember the 1957 season , when the team went 0-27. // Things began to turn around in the early 1960 ' s , but the modern Snook era began in 1962 when a new coach arrived with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been an assistant in Buna , Tex. , to Coach Cotton Robinson , whose teams won about as consistently as Snook does now . <> <> Working as a Team // Robinson ran a system based on a patient , methodical offense and a pressing defense . Horn brought the same system to Snook , and it has been used ever since. // Snook plays a patient offense in which the team works the ball around for as long as it takes to get a good shot inside or an open jumper. // On defense , Snook usually uses a full-court , man-to-man press throughout the game. // " Our kids learn to sacrifice individual-type goals to be a team player , " said Victorick , who played on Snook ' s 1966 state championship team. // " You look at our teams over this period , they ' ll have one or two good players and a lot of average players . The idea is to put together a team , and I put that in quotation marks . There ' ve been plenty of times when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better team . " <> <> First College Prospect // Many youngsters start learning the Snook system by playing in basketball leagues that begin in the fifth grade . This year ' s outfit differs from others because it contains Snook ' s first full-fledged star. // He ' s Walter Martin , a 6-8 junior center who averaged 22 points and 12 rebounds a game this year . The other regulars range from 5-8 to 6-1. // Victorick said Martin was the first genuine major college prospect he has coached . No Snook player has gone on to play major college ball. // The team is 29-6 so far this season , with all of the losses coming in non-conference games with bigger schools from cities as large as Austin. // Snook now competes in Class A sports , limited to schools with 134 students or fewer . Because of recent enrollment gains , it will move up to Class AA next year , the level at which it competed from 1971 to 1978 . Class AA next year will include schools of up to 284 students. // Snook has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 89-16 - and will play again Friday night . It takes five victories to make it to the Final Four in the state Class A tournament in Austin . <> <> Apathy Sets In // All this success has not come without problems. // Snook wins so consistently that it ' s hard to get the local folks excited during the regular season. // Victorick says attendance has been up this year . But for many Snook residents , the season doesn ' t really start until the playoffs , which Snook has been in every year but two since 1960. // " Unless there ' s a really fierce local contest against a good team like Dime Box or Anderson , it ' s hard to get people too excited , " said Rudy Junek , president of the First Bank of Snook and a veteran of the 0-27 season . " A lot of people will travel to the playoff games , but some people don ' t get involved until then. " // But for most players and residents , the team is an enormous source of pride. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention Snook , most of them will know about the basketball program , " said Junek. // Snook ' s biggest problem may be its own success . Snook has sparked enough interest in its area that basketball has become more important than football for many schools in the area . And for many teams , playing Snook is like playing the Celtics. // " You can see it in their eyes , " said Gerald Hawkins , a 5-9 junior . " They could lose all their games , but if they beat Snook , it ' s been a good year. " //
