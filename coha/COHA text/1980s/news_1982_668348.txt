It was a day to determine : a ) if man could row in conditions that reminded an older generation of Admiral Byrd ; b ) if icebergs still existed in the Charles River Basin , and c ) if Steve Gladstone retained the touch he had a few years back when he labored with oarsmen at Harvard ' s Newell Boathouse . On a day that suited perfectly the windup of the holy season of Lent , it was possible to conclude that : a ) human beings are hardy enough to survive rough water , 25 mph northwesterlies and a windchill factor of 15 degrees b ) the Lower Basin was free of ice and c ) that coach Gladstone ' s return to the Charles could be the day of his young life . Gladstone took over the coaching job at Brown after Vic Michaelson ' s retirement last June , and his inheritance included a freshman eight that won the IRA ' s at Syracuse . This is no guarantee of instant success , but it ' s a building block , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right track . In one of the few races held over the standard 2000-meter course , Brown ' s varsity handled the perilous seas of the Lower Basin with aplomb , and when Harvard Bridge ( almost awash in the spray that whipped over it ) was reached , this test was over . Brown was beyond recall . Boston University , certainly the favorite , was more than two lengths astern . And Coast Guard must have been looking for submerged ice . At any rate they were not actually racing on a day when survival took priority . " They were solid . We were not , " said a disappointed BU coach Bill Miller , who had expected much more . " We did not row as we thought we could row . We did not do as well as we should have at San Diego last week , either . Brown did its job well . We are in need of lots of work . " Northeastern ' s varsity was due to be tested on an informal , but strong , basis . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s big boat and CRASH-B ( Charles River All-Star Has Beens , an Olympic Eight ) . Common sense prevailed . The trio moved upstream , where most competition was held , incidentally , and did just pieces - short sprints and some starts . In football , it would be called a controlled scrimmage . Yale ' s lightweights evidentally are as potent as their big brothers , and the so-called small men showed mucho muscle in the tests against MIT up near The Stadium . The varsity won by a length over 1700 meters , the jayvees by about six lengths , but then proved to be human - or possibly frozen - as the Sliderule AC ' s freshman boat got home first by four lengths . The ladies rowed well at some times , frantically at others . And when all hands were accounted for , Radcliffe ruled the river . The ' Cliffies won a lot of races . The real winners on a day best forgotten were the coxswains . It was so cold none was dunked in the Charles . For one day at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
