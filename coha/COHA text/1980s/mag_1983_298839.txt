Turner wins a cable war <P> When Satellite NewsChannels went on the air in June 1982 , officials of the cable-TV service predicted they would soon put Ted Turner 's rival Cable News Network out of business . SNC 's corporate parents , ABC and Westinghouse , boasted greater news-gathering assets than CNN and deeper pockets to offset losses . The stock market agreed : after SNC was an nounced , the over-the-counter price of a share of Turner Broadcasting System fell from $16 to $11.50 in two days . But last week David conquered Goliath with his checkbook . Turner bought out SNC for $25 million in order to shut it down on Oct. 27 . Said his spokes man Arthur Sando : " The resources that were used to fight the competition can now strengthen CNN . " <P> Turner 's company will acquire almost none of SNC 's assets except the key one : 7.5 million subscriber households , most of which will be added to the 22.6 million that receive CNN or the 5.3 million that get a sister cable service , CNN Head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed steep . Many of SNC 's house holds are already reached by one or both of Turner 's services . Moreover , SNC had lost an estimated $60 million in 1 6 months , had failed to match CNN 's depth and variety , and might have folded within a year or two . <P> But other analysts predicted that the two CNN services would soon attract more advertising and charge cable operators a larger fee per subscriber . Said Bonnie Cook of a Nashville securities firm , Bradford &; Co. : " Now Turner is the only game in town . " Cook predicts that Turner 's news services could rebound from combined losses of $15 million this year to a 1984 profit of $2 million or more as a result of the SNC deal . <P> SNC is the third network-linked cable service to collapse in little more than a year . The Entertainment Channel , which was financed in part by NBC 's parent corporation , RCA , failed to attract subscribers . CBS Cable , a cultural channel , reached 5 million households but , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ritchie of Westinghouse Broad casting and Cable attributed SNC 's woes to aggressive competition . Since SNC 's debut , ABC , CBS and NBC have added a to tal of 33 hours a week of late-night and early-morning news shows . Thus , says Ritchie , " the availability of commercial time in broadcast news about doubled . " His wry summation of SNC 'S costly fling : " Our contribution has been to increase network news coverage . "
