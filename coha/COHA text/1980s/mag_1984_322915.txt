Unloading state-owned dinosaurs is proving hard to do <P> Bumbling inefficiency and weak management have long characterized British industry . The reason , charged Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher while running for office , was that nearly 40 years of state ownership had sapped the initiative of many of Britain 's largest and best-known companies . So within months after coming to power in 1979 , Thatcher and her Conservative Party took steps to sell the assets of numerous firms to private investors . About half of Britoil ( 1983 pretax profits : $762 million ) is now in private hands , as is all of the Jaguar automobile division of BL , formerly British Leyland . <P> The push to " privatization , " however , has been among the most controversial and difficult undertakings of the Thatcher government . Union leaders and members of the opposition Labor Party , which began the movement toward state-owned enterprises in 1946 , howl that the sell-off is really a form of " piratization , " which robs the British people of companies that rightfully belong to them . The critics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Industry and a key figure in the socialist selloff , the " principal gravedigger of British industry . " <P> Selling the companies is proving trickier than the Conservatives had expected . Frequent squabbles have broken out within the government over such basic questions as which companies to privatize and when to do it . Simply bringing the companies ' stock to market has often been a problem . Jaguar 's initial offering of 178 million shares sold out quickly in July , prompting Labor charges that the price was too low and that British industry was being divested for far less than it was worth . At the other extreme was the stock of Britoil , which found few initial takers because it was offered just as energy prices fell . <P> Moreover , the government 's notion of turning Britain into a nation of stockholders has not panned out . The biggest buyers of stock have been large institutional investors rather than ordinary Britons , many of whom are unaccustomed to the idea of stock ownership after decades of nationalized industry . A majority of the new offerings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and banks , and chunks of the rest have not been sold . Speculation in the issues has been rampant as shareholders bought in , held briefly , then sold for a quick profit . The fact that relatively few investors have participated in ownership of the companies worries Thatcher 's Conservatives . Without millions of shareholders to contend with , a new Labor government might have an easier time shifting back to state control . <P> Now looming are sales of British Airways and Rolls-Royce , the enginemaker . The largest privatization move will come in the fall when 51% of British Telecom , the telecommunications monopoly , goes on the block in an anticipated $4 billion selloff . Union members have called the breakup of ownership " an act of economic vandalism , " and some engineers staged a brief protest strike .
