Part of the beauty of the original " build-down " approach was that it promised to be simple . But months of tinkering by various experts and Congressmen added a wide variety of refinements that make build-down as complicated as a Chinese menu-or perhaps a menu in Chinese . <P> Under the proposal , the U.S. and U.S.S.R. would have to reduce their overall nuclear arsenals by 45% by 1996 . The key to the plan is a new unit of destructive power called Standard Weapons Station ( SWS ) , which was developed by retired Air Force Lieut . General Glenn Kent . In its simplest form , an SWS represents a warhead atop a ballistic missile , a bomb on a plane , a self-propelled cruise missile . Kent 's plan includes complex formulas so that oversize warheads count extra . So do multiple warheads that are clustered on top of missiles with particularly powerful lifting capability , known as " throw-weight . " The details are still being honed in Washington and would be negotiable with the Soviets . <P> As it is , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SWS 's assigned to a bomber would be its total takeoff weight divided by a " K " factor . The K factor for a plane carrying cruise missiles would yield a greater SWS total than the K factor for an identical plane carrying bombs , which are viewed as less lethal . The K factor for land-based missiles takes into account the size and number of warheads . Thus the MX missile , with ten warheads , could count as ten SWS's-but the Soviet SS-18 , which also has ten warheads , would equal 20.5 SWS 's , because it has larger warheads and more throw-weight . <P> The U.S. and U.S.S.R. now have about 16,000 SWS 's . To help it get down to 8,500 SWS 's by 1996 , the U.S. could replace its current 1,045 land-based missiles ( 2,565 SWS 's ) with 100 MX missiles ( 1,000 SWS 's ) and 500 single-warhead Midgetman missiles ( another 500 SWS 's ) . The Soviets could , if they wanted , keep 300 of their SS-18 missiles ( 6,150 SWS 's ) and fill the remainder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal is to penalize retention of such large weapons and move the Soviet Union-and the U.S.-to more stabilizing systems .
