txt loan Beck A learning experience for two new gardeners It was n't that they were into veggies or still thought it possible to find a way to save money on the food bill . It had simply been a long , gray winter and they were hungry to do something tangible that hinted of summer . Why not a garden ? She was a writer , he an artist . Neither had a green thumb or any relevant experience , unless you count her philodendron or his crabgrass . They did have a big back yard . They could read the promises on the backs of the seed packages in the supermarket and the copy blocks beside the pictures in the seed catalog . And so they were hooked . It turned out to be , as their children remind them , a Learning Experience , First , they discovered that the grass that had been no hard to establish in the back yard was even harder and more expensive to remove : put down a quick $50 for the man who did it with a machine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they set out the tender tomato seedlings they had been raising for weeks in starter boxes on the window sills . The next morning the soil was bare-black again , every trace of tomato nibbled away by the rabbits they had so thoughtfully fed through the winter blizzards . Add $45 and two afternoons ' time for fencing and $22.15 for buying more tomatoes and yielding to assorted other temptations at the nursery . By late June , they were eating their own lettuce and exulting in the minor miracles that turned the zucchini leaves fat and prickly , sent the threads of sugar pea tendrils casting out into space to find supports , and turned the first strawberries an almost ready-to-eaVed . That night , the rabbits learned to jump the fence . After that , they managed to eat at least part of every strawberry that ripened . The rabbits ignored the homemade noise makers that were supposed to frighten them away and the dried animal blood l$7.501 that was recommended to repel them . And in a final gesture of defiance by the weak against the forbearing strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the peas . sloe rabbits ate the cabbage , too . Perhaps it was just as well . He only liked cabbage cooked , with corned beef , he told her . She refused to cook it at all because of the smell . A Learning Experience . The marriage survived . They did not learn fast enough , however , that the bounty of the garden would not wait for them . Hundreds of beans ripened at once and grew coarse and tough when they were not picked immediately . The broccoli turned into clusters of yellow flowers while they were away for a weekend . The cauliflower refused to clump together into proper heads , resisted a clumsy effort to tie it into shape , and insisted on growing tall and into separate stalks . The cantaloupe , cucumbers , and Brussels sprouts disappeared , perhaps eaten by insects despite the pesticides i$7.571 , perhaps pulled as weeds by amateurs who did not know what they were supposed to look like and were n't quite sure where they had been planted . But the eggplant 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but refused to eat it every night ; she , for reasons lost in the mists of childhood , refused to eat it at all . They tried 17 different recipes for zucchini but drew the line at zucchini cake . And they have come to measure friendships by the amount of summer squash they can persuade others to accept . The raspberries disappointed most . Of the four dozen plants ordered from the catalog a $58-plus-postage splurge only 17 ever showed a sign of life . One bore a cherished berry , but a bird beat them to eating it . Next year , they promise each other , or the year after . The tomato plants are still growing so expansively they overwhelm the stakes and topple in the summer storms . The tomatoes themselves are incredibly large but as strangely convoluted as a human brain and many of them show the marks of the rabbits ' nibbling and the insects ' invasion . And they refuse to ripen in the record rainfall . Impatient , she will saute some while they are still green . Altogether an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will never dare add up the cost .
