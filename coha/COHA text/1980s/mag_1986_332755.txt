When the value of the dollar began falling early last year , American manufacturers were confident that their competitive powers would be rejuvenated . As the currency weakened , they reasoned , U.S. exports would become cheaper , while foreign imports would grow more expensive for American consumers . The trade deficit would begin its long-awaited decline . Economists cautioned that it would take time  --  twelve months , a year and a half at the most . But it would happen . This was no idle daydream , after all , but a proven tenet of modern economic policy . <P> Things have not turned out that way . Since March 1985 the dollar has fallen in value by about 30% against an average of major currencies , and yet the trade gap  --  economic theory be damned  --  keeps right on growing . Last week the Government reported that the trade deficit hit a record six-month level of $83.9 billion . June 's trade imbalance was almost identical to the one posted in May . If the deficit keeps expanding at the current pace , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13% increase over 1985 's record level . Plainly , the widely expected turnaround in the balance of trade is now overdue . Says Walter Heller , chief economic adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Johnson and one of many economists who had predicted that the trade deficit would surely be shrinking by now : " This is a staggering surprise . We have to admit we were off base on timing . " <P> If the trade deficit does not soon diminish , some economists fear , its effects could help push the U.S. into a recession .

It has undoubtedly caused much of the recent slowdown in growth : the economy expanded at a 1.1% annual rate between April and June , down from a 3.8% rate the previous quarter . The Commerce Department reported last week that the index of leading economic indicators , a barometer of future growth , increased by a modest 1.3% in June . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of jobless Americans fell from 7.1% to 6.9% of the population . <P> The seemingly intractable trade deficit is reviving pleas for protectionism . This week the House of Representatives will reconsider ) legislation to assist the ailing textile industry by drastically reducing imports . President Reagan has vetoed this bill , but the House will now vote on a proposal to override that veto . Supporting textile protection has become a cause celebre for critics of Reagan 's free-trade policies . Said House Speaker Tip O'Neill at a Washington rally for textile workers : " It is time , Mr. President . . . to take off your STAY THE COURSE button and start wearing a MADE IN THE U.S.A. button .
