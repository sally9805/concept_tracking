Union Carbide Corp. agreed Tuesday to pay India $470 million to settle all civil and criminal actions from the 1984 gas leak in Bhopal , which killed more than 3 , 300 people in the world ' s deadliest industrial accident . The surprise settlement , ordered by the Indian Supreme Court , works out to roughly $140 , 000 for each person killed by the pesticide cloud that spilled from the plant into the surrounding shantytowns-not much by today ' s U.S. standards . Indeed , American attorneys representing the victims denounced the settlement as an injustice . But R.S. Pathak , India ' s chief justice , called the payment a " just , fair , equitable and reasonable sum . " Without the settlement , attorneys said families of the victims might not have been compensated for months or years as the case dragged through the courts . Union Carbide must pay the government $470 million by March 31 . Officials at the Danbury , Conn. - based chemical company said it would meet the deadline in exchange for the dismissal of all criminal and civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 on the New York Stock Exchange , its highest close in more than a year . The company also led trading , with more than 6. 3 million shares changing hands . Carbide said the payment will reduce its 1988 profits by less than 10 percent , or about $70 million . The company said earlier that net income last year came to $720 million , or $5. 31 a share , on sales of $8. 32 billion . Insurance will cover an additional $200 million of the payment . The company will borrow the remaining $200 million , slightly inflating its interest expenses , said James Wilbur , a chemical industry analyst with Smith Barney , Harris Upham &; Co. in New York . Overall , though , Wilbur and other analysts said Carbide comes out well ahead . The Indian government had been seeking at least $3 billion for families of those killed and for the estimated 20 , 000 seriously injured . While analysts doubted that $3 billion would have been paid , they said Carbide ' s liability could have been much more than $470 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ravitz , a Salomon Brothers Inc. analyst in New York . " It was terribly distracting to have this liability sitting there . Also , in the humane sense , it ' s the right thing to do , so it ' s fair to both sides . " Ravitz said resolution of the case also allows Carbide to borrow money against $3 billion in assets that it pledged to the Indian courts that it would leave unencumbered to cover potential damages . That represented more than a third of Carbide ' s total assets of $7. 9 billion and had been an effective " poison pill " against a takeover , Ravitz said . Carbide ' s debt at the end of 1987 was $3. 4 billion , much of it left over from its battle with GAF Corp. , which tried to acquire the company for $5 billion in late 1985 . Bhopal joined Three Mile Island , Love Canal and Chernobyl as a symbol of the possibilities of industrial horror . A lethal gas leaked from the Carbide plant in Bhopal on Dec. 3 , 1984 . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 700 people were dead , according to the Indian government . Since then , the government said , victims have died at an average of one a day , bringing the toll to at least 3 , 329 . In addition , 20 , 000 people were seriously injured by the gas , which spread through shantytowns outside the plant gates in central India as the residents slept . Carbide blamed the leak on employee sabotage . But the Indian government had charged the company with negligence . Three days after the disaster , Indian authorities arrested Carbide ' s then-chairman , Warren Anderson , when he visited the site . He was later released , but Indian authorities charged him with homicide in 1987 . That charge was dropped under the settlement . A lawsuit on behalf of the victims was filed in U.S. District Court in New York but was remanded to the Indian courts in May , 1986 . While the case was still under U.S. jurisdiction , Carbide and attorneys for the Indian victims tentatively agreed to settle for $350 million . The sum was rejected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s Supreme Court had been hearing the case after Carbide appealed a state supreme court ruling ordering the company to pay $192 million in interim compensation . On Tuesday , " Having considered all the facts and circumstances . . . in particular the enormity of human suffering occasioned by the Bhopal gas disaster , " the court surprised attorneys by ordering the settlement . Chief Justice Pathak ordered both sides to detail terms of the agreement in court Wednesday . Carbide said the money would go to the Indian government , which would administer the funds in accordance with the Bhopal Gas Processing of Claims Act , passed by India ' s Parliament in 1985 . Earlier , the Indian government had paid 10 , 000 rupees-or about $766-to the families of each person killed by the gas . While the litigation has distracted Carbide , analyst Wilbur noted that the company ' s 1988 earnings increased faster than those of its three U.S.-based rivals : E.I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co . , Dow Chemical Co. and Monsanto Co.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
