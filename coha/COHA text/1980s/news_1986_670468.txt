All the ghosts and demons and curses of the past 68 years continued to haunt the Boston Red Sox last night as the New York Mets won the seventh game of the World Series , 8-5 - with an a capella chorus of fans chanting the Boston players ' names derisively - to bring more gloom to the New England region , which has not enjoyed a World Series victory since 1918. // " I don ' t know nothin ' about history , " John McNamara said on Saturday night after Mookie Wilson ' s strange little grounder squirmed its way into history . " And I don ' t want to hear anything about choking or any of that junk. " // Of course he doesn ' t , but there is no denying that the Boston Red Sox have been playing under a cloud ever since their owner , Harry Frazee , sold off Babe Ruth early in 1920 , and that cloud settled over them in this Series . All the leads they had , all the chances , went down the drain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1975 and 1978. // " Good ups , bad downs , " sighed Bob Stanley , the relief pitcher who was on the team when Bucky Dent ' s fly lofted over the wall , and who was on the mound when Buckner couldn ' t bend for Wilson ' s wobbler. // These current Red Sox , who will say they have nothing in common with those other teams , took a 2-0 lead in this Series and then a 3-2 lead coming back to Shea . Even when they dissipated three separate leads and lost early Sunday morning , they appeared to catch a break when it rained for nearly 24 hours , postponing the final game. // John McNamara made the right decision in bypassing Oil Can Boyd in favor of Bruce Hurst , who had beaten the Mets twice in the Series , and they even gave Hurst a 3-0 lead into the sixth inning . But this franchise has seen other breaks go down the drain in the past 68 years. // " That ' s baseball , " Hurst said , volunteering that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess that ' s why they invented three outs per inning . I got a little tired. " // It was human and understandable for Hurst to tire , but the opening of the bullpen door will rank with other accidents , calamities , disasters , bad luck , flops and failures in Red Sox history , and nobody even used McNamara ' s word , " choking. " // The Sox had come so close , in seventh games of the World Series in 1946 , 1967 and 1975 , in the final weekend of the pennant race of 1949 and in the one-game Eastern Division playoff of 1978 , that the fans of New England have developed a losers ' twitch , an expectation that the worst possible thing might happen. // The fans knew . The talk show hosts knew . Bill Buckner ' s ruined ligaments were making him the Gabriela Andersen-Schiess of this World Series . ( She was the dehydrated , discombobulated runner who staggered to the finish of the 1984 Olympic marathon . ) The fans knew . It had happened so often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to have a reputation as a country-club team , with great hitters but without the normal barbed humor and collective wisdom that winning teams must have . Who was it who described the Red Sox as 25 men taking 25 different cabs on their way to dinner ? // This year they seemed nothing like that . This year they became a team , as soon as George Steinbrenner and his " baseball people " traded Don Baylor to the Red Sox in March . Baylor became the leader the Red Sox never had , forming a kangaroo court , taunting and teasing the playeras into becoming closer teammates. // But there are a lot of haunted memories in this franchise , which won the first World Series in 1903 , and then won it in 1912 , 1915 , 1916 and 1918 , acquiring the child of nature , George Herman Ruth , who became the best left-handed pitcher on the team and potentially the greatest slugger in the game . Yet the owner sold him to the lowly New York Yankees to finance one of his Broadway shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same. // Any Boston fan can fill in the gruesome details , with blunt opinions , how Ted Williams batted only . 200 and drove in one run in the 1946 Series , how Johnny Pesky seemed to hold the ball an instant too long as Country Slaughter steamed home from first on Harry Walker ' s hit. // Perhaps the fans of New England would have talked about the brave comeback against California in the fifth game of the league championships , three runs down in the ninth inning , but now they are likely only to remember the two leads in New York , and the disaster coming out of the bullpen. // " I ' ll probably take the heat this winter , " said Bob Stanley , who threw the wild pitch that set up the Saturday disaster , and was one of the few Sox willing to sit in front of his locker after last night ' s game . " I can only say that I was doing my best. " // The clubhouse was more dismal than most clubhouses at the end of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost a 3-1 lead last year . The players took it hard for themselves , but the ones who live in New England also knew what it would be like to drop into the local barber shop this winter. // " They ' ll probably give me a crew cut , " Stanley said. // The ghosts of 1946 and the other disasters have nothing to do with young Calvin Schiraldi , a sensitive-looking college man who earned a job in the Red Sox bullpen this season , but lost the two games in New York , giving up the go-ahead homer to Ray Knight on his fourth pitch last night. // " Responsible ? I blew two games , " Schiraldi said , graciously willing to face the press afterward . " I was the one who let the runners score . Will I get over it ? I guess . At this time , I don ' t know how. " // Schiraldi had not been born in 1946 when Slaughter went into motion . He was not born in 1949 when the Red Sox lost the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Lonborg ' s arm couldn ' t make it on two days ' rest . He was 13 when Darrell Johnson pinch-hit for Jim Willoughby and brought in Jim Burton. // And he was 16 when Mike Torrez threw the home-run pitch to Bucky Dent . He never even dreamed of playing for the Boston Red Sox . He signed , after all , with the New York Mets . But now this young man with the long eyelashes is a Red Sox for the ages , part of the 68 heartbreaking years , and counting. //
