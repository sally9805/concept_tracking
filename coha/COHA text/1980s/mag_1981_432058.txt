P603 IOWA HAS A RIGHT to feel insulted . Outsiders tend to confuse it with Idaho or Ohio ? states with all those I 's and O 's in their names . " Where are you from ? " goes a typical conversation . " Iowa . " " Oh , really ? I have a sister in Columbus ! " Such urban provincials usually picture Iowa as a featureless flatland of corn with a hayseed farmer standing in the middle . They crack jokes about " the little old lady from Dubuque " ? for whom , said the New Yorker 's late editor Harold Ross , his magazine was not intended . Then they toss out that other cliche Iowans detest , " But will they get it in Des Moines ? " Well , if Iowa secedes from the Union , we asked for it . We 've literally been biting the hand that feeds us . Last year Iowa led the states in production of corn , soybeans , and livestock . If Iowa were to secede with its similarly maligned neighbor , Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , the rest of us would have to import grain , like the Russians . But Iowa , of course , is n't seceding . It asks only that we cast aside our stereotypes and take a long clear look at this fertile Middle Earth in our midst . I did just that this past year , and I want to report that Iowa is not flat , is not featureless , and that they 'll not only " get it " in Des Moines ? they probably heard it long ago . And if you think they grow only corn in Iowa , consider a few of the American originals to spring out of this rich earth : from Buffalo Bill to Lillian Russell to John Wayne , from Bix Beiderbecke and Glenn Miller to Bob Feller and Johnny Carson ( sorry about that , Nebraska ) , from John L. Lewis and Grant Wood to Herbert Hoover and Mamie Doud Eisenhower . This is top-choice America , America cut thick and prime . I arrived in deep winter ? a presidential winter , you might call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope John Paul II 's visit to Iowa just three months before had come during the biggest corn harvest in history . There was a sense of providence about it all . And now the voice of the politician was heard in the land . It was that quadrennial commotion , the Iowa precinct caucuses ? kicking off Campaign ' 80 a month before the New Hampshire primaries . Here , in 1976 , Jimmy Carter won his first big victory on his way to the White House . It was little noted at the time that he actually ran second ? to " uncommitted . " Now 1980 's  |p608  candidates were stalking each other through the snow-crusted corn stubble . Carter , who 'd just jolted Iowa farmers with the Soviet grain embargo , was unable to campaign personally , he said , because of the Iran and Afghanistan crises . Among the Republican candidates was a certain former Davenport and Des Moines sportscaster fondly remembered hereabouts as " Dutch " Reagan . The media swarmed . Even Walter Cronkite was here . Well , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edged Reagan . A white-haired dark horse named John @# Anderson emerged from the Republican pack . The lineaments of Campaign ' 80 were being sketched out here in Iowa . But the quickest flowing comment came from the good citizens of Emmetsburg ( population 4,600 ) . The level in the town 's water tower , it seems , drops measurably when water usage is heavy . A local radio station asked supporters of candidates to flush their toilets on signal . When President Carter 's name was announced , the level dropped a tenth of a foot ? about 300 flushes . When ? Senator Kennedy 's name was called , it barely dropped at all . Characteristically ,  |p609  the level dropped the most ? two-tenths of a foot , about 600 votes ? when the town 's uncommitted flushed their preference . So much for Emmetsburg 's " cast a flush " poll -- to my knowledge , an Iowa invention . Contrary to reports , the highest point in Iowa is not a pig lot . It 's a cattle lot . The Confusion dates from a 1971 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's highest point from northwest Iowa 's 1,613-foot Ocheyedan Mound to the slightly higher site located on the Merrill Sterler farm near Sibley . Mrs. Sterler recalls : " The surveyors @# found the highest spot back of the barn . They saw a pig pokin ' around , and the story got out it was a pig lot . But it was n't . There is a cattle lot up there , though ? so the story 's not so far off . " It is true that a staggering 94 percent of Iowa is classified as farmland . But the other 6 percent is packed with surprises . To begin with , Iowa is n't a flatland at all . Even in the relatively level north-central section of the state there 's a subtle tilt and roll to the . America 's Middle Earth 609  |p612  land ? nothing like the vast ruler-straight horizons in parts of Kansas or Nebraska or North and South Dakota . Most of Iowa , in fact , is emphatically hilly . The landscape curves almost sensuously , the horizons undulate , the hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When a movie company last year combed the state for location shots of an uninterrupted flatland of corn , they could n't find any and went over to Illinois . Had they been looking for blue-water lakes , however , they might have tried northwest Iowa 's Great Lakes resort area , centered around beautiful Lake Okoboji and Spirit Lake . If they were after limestone bluffs and stream-laced forests , they might have explored northeast Iowa 's Little Switzerland . Along the Mississippi River they could have roamed a coastline about as long as Oregon 's seacoast , studded with towns and cities mingling Victorian elegance with an almost maritime flavor ? Keokuk and Muscatine , Burlington and Davenport , @#  |p613  Clinton and Dubuque , and picturesque little McGregor . Iowa has a second great coast ? along the Missouri River Valley , where , between Council Bluffs and the Missouri state line , hills tumble in lovely disarray . Created millennia ago by winds sweeping across the glacial-age Missouri River floodplain , these highlv erosive hills and bluffs of loess ? windblown silt ? have few counterparts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state is dotted with ethnically flavored @#  |p614  communities ? Dutch Pella and Orange City , Danish Elk Horn and Kimballton , Swedish Stanton , Norwegian Decorah , Czech Spillville , the Amana Colonies , Amish Kalona , the Mesquakie Indian settlement near Tama , to name but a few . And then there 's Carter Lake ( population 3,400 ) -a bit of Iowa in Omaha , Nebraska ! Back in 1877 , a shift in the Missouri 's course put Carter Lake on the Nebraska side of the river . The Supreme Court in 1892 ruled it still belonged to Iowa .  |p615  " We 've resisted every effort to include us in Omaha or Nebraska , " Mrs. Dee Harrison told me . " We 're Iowans , pure and simple . We even lobbied and got an Iowa area code 712 and our own Iowa zip code 51510 . " Farmer Bob Barr keeps a rock propped up next to his house in Iowa 's black-earth country near Fort Dodge . It 's a curious rock  - -  dark , and bigger than a watermelon . On its face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in rough relief . " Hit it with my plow out in my bean field about five years back , " Bob told me . " Pulled it out , wiped off the dirt , and there it was ? a cross , the Lord 's sign . " Something made me haul it up here and set it by the door . Then , one day last August I looked out , and there , like doom itself , coming straight for the house , was a twister , the biggest thing I 've ever seen . . . . " Me and my wife , Bun , we hid under the cellar steps . For four minutes that twister shook the house like a demon . Bun and I prayed for the Lord to take us quick . " Finally the noise stopped . I went out to look . Well , that twister had ripped apart  |p617  both the barn and garage . Not once but twice it came up to the house and stopped by God ? right in front of that rock , then backed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You remember in Luke , the line about the stones crying out to the Lord ? Well sir , surely this rock here cried out to the Lord on our behalf . " Faith . You need plenty of it out here in Iowa . And , by God , you find it . There 's geology as well as theology in Bob Barr 's " rock of the cross . " Some rocks , it @# happens , tend to weather in crosslike patterns . Some 14,000 years ago a glacier gouged this boulder from somewhere to the north and dropped it down here onto the patch of ground that would one day become Bob Barr 's soybean field . In the process the ice modified the topography left by earlier glaciers in north-central Iowa and laid the groundwork for as prime a piece of agricultural real estate as exists on the planet . This is Class I farmland ? a geologic treasure . Glaciers provided its underlying rough till , scooping much of it out of Minnesota 's lakes region . Ancient winds whipped in rich silt and fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie , halting encroaching forests by destroying tree seedlings but leaving the tallgrass roots unharmed . Millennia of deep-rooted prairie plants helped knead into the surface the organic matter that would transform the primordial mix into that ultimate end stuff ? Iowa topsoil . Timely Invention Conquers Prairie Pioneers in the 1830s found topsoil nearly two feet deep . They did n't even try to farm the prairie , however , preferring to clear the wooded river bottoms . Their wood-andiron plows simply could n't break the roottangled prairie sod . Only after John Deere invented a sharp-bladed steel plow in 1837 was the prairie 's conquest assured . " People do n't realize that much of northcentral Iowa was once marshland , " Bob Barr recalls , harking back to his grandfather 's days . " Early farmers tilled the knolls . Draining the land became crucial . You see all those ditches around here ? Without them this would still be marsh . " I walked one afternoon through a 160-acre patch of wild-flower-paisley preserve called Cayler Prairie . With me was Dr. John Downey from nearby Lakeside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prairie wind like strokes of a Japanese painter 's brush . " People driving past do n't comprehend what they 're seeing here , " Dr. Downey said . " They think this is a bunch of weeds . But it takes centuries for tallgrass prairie to reach full development . "  |p618  Today barely a tenth of one percent of Iowa 's prairie remains . The state 's topsoil has dwindled to an average depth of eight inches . Each decade another inch or so erodes away . Productivity has its price . It 's not only the soil that 's productive in Iowa . The state 's often unsung industries actually produce three times the dollar volume of its farms . Of the nation 's top 500 corporations , 135 maintain plants in Iowa . Many of these , of course , are farm relatedbig-name implement dealers like John Deere , food processors like Quaker Oats , and the remarkable Iowa Beef Processors , which over the past decade eclipsed Swift , Armour , and others to become the world 's biggest meat-packer . But Iowa also produces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newton ) , Amana microwave ovens ( in Middle Amana ) , Sheaffer pens ( Fort Madison ) , and Winnebago motor homes ( Forest City ) . Rockwell International , in Cedar Rapids , makes printing presses and avionics equipment . Some 100 insurance firms are headquartered here ? from Des Moines-based majors like the Bankers Life of Iowa , American Republic , and Equitable of Iowa Companies to Farmers Mutual Hail Insurance Company of Iowa . Again , you expect Iowa to produce agricultural giants like Henry A. Wallace , who pioneered hybrid corn and edited Wallaces Farmer before becoming secretary of agriculture and vice president , or Dr. Norman Borlaug , the Nobel Prize-winning geneticist whose new wheat strains spurred the Green  |p619  Revolution that has saved millions around the world from hunger . But Iowa 's genius extends to the skies as well as the earth below .

" Hayseed " Iowans ? Then why do eight million subscribers from New York to San Francisco and abroad take monthly cues for daily living from Iowa-based Better Homes and Gardens , published in Des Moines by the Meredith Corporation ? which also publishes Metropolitan Home ( formerly Apartment Life ) and Successful Farming ? Why has the Des Moines Register and Tribune Company , publishing two dailies in a city of under 200,000 , garnered no fewer than 13 Pulitzer Prizes ? Why does the Writers ' Workshop at the University of Iowa continue to turn out major American authors ? from novelists Flannery O'Connor ( Wise Blood ) and John Irving ( The World According to Garp ) to Pulitzer Prize-winning poets W. D. Snodgrass and , just last year , Donald Justice ? The unexpected , you come to find , is routine in amazing Iowa . Tap . Tap . Tap .

Pile drivers beat a deep tattoo as spidery cranes toy with the city 's modest but muscular skyline -- topped out by the 36-story Ruan Center . On a hilltop across the Des Moines Tiver , the gold-domed State Capitol presides in dowager elegance . Des Moines is rebuilding , revitalizing itself after a three-decade inner-city downslide that saw its once flourishing downtown @# turn dowdy as business and industry , customers and residents flowed out to prospering new suburbs . It 's what happened in Detroit and Chicago and Cleveland , but on a smaller scale here in Iowa ? in cities in the 50,000 to 200,000 range such as Des Moines , Council Bluffs , Cedar Rapids , Davenport , Sioux City , Waterloo-Cedar Falls . Yet Iowa 's urban areas are now regearing for the future . People-luring complexes such as Cedar Rapids ' Five Seasons Center and Council Bluffs ' Midlands Mall are models of inner-city rejuvenation .

Stephens Auditorium at Iowa State in Ames , Hancher Auditorium at the University of Iowa in Iowa City , and the UNI-Dome at the University of Northern Iowa in Cedar Falls . Iowans care about the arts ? deeply , and sometimes furiously . When the Des Moines Symphony 's board of directors last year decided not to renew the contract of brilliant but fiery conductor Yuri Krasnapolsky , citizen uproar was tremendous . Krasnapolsky was triumphantly rehired . Out in little Garrison ( population 400 ) , a professional acting troupe headed by artistic director Tom Johnson runs the Old Creamery Theater Company ? attracting 25,000 theatergoers in 1980 and reaching out via touring companies to 75,000 more . Over at the Iowa State Arts Council in Des Moines , director Sam Grabarski and his associate Nan Stillians weigh thousands of requests for the precious few funds available to subsidize projects in the arts . Says Stillians : " Who 's to say the next Shakespeare or Rembrandt wo n't come from right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , searching for new talent , funding theaters and orchestras and museums . We also send out Touring Arts Teams ? actors and artists and musicians who perform and teach in small Iowa towns . " Even if no Iowa Shakespeare emerges , we have our rewards ? like the look in the eyes of a farm kid when he watches professional actors turn a gymnasium into a stage and first realizes the magic of the theater . " Effervescent talk-show hostess Mary  |p620  Brubaker whirls into the offices of station KCCI-TV . Des Moines ' answer to Johnny Carson ( who , by the way , was born in Corning , Iowa , though raised in Nebraska ) , Mary hosts the weekday-morning " Mary Brubaker Show , " a bubbly potpourri of celebrity interviews , social controversy , homemaking , and local announcements . " I remember one day back in February 1975 , " she recalls . " One of the politicians in town for early presidential campaigning wanted an interview . I 'd never heard of him , but I agreed if we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , " she laughs , " it was Jimmy Carter , of course . "  |p621  In 1977 Mary found herself up against the network " Donahue " show , shown in Des Moines in the same time slot as her own . " Can you imagine a tougher competitor ? " she asks . " In only three months our locally produced show lost 5,000 of our regular 20,000 listening households . " I like Donahue ' myself . But we 're going on . We 're committed to local programming here . We 're committed to Iowa ! " I 'm out walking the beans . As any local teenager will tell you , that means going up and down the endless soybean rows hacking out the weeds . There 's no better way to get a sense of just how big an acre is than walking the beans . It 's late July . Hot . Texas has moved up to Iowa . Each time I poke my hoe at a weed , a cloud of dust swirls up . We 're six weeks into the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April and May planting season , scotching hopes that 1980 's harvest would reach 1979 's record levels . Rains finally came in June , but as gully washers , which dissolved newly sprayed herbicide too quickly , leaving weedy fields in their wake . Then came the hailstorms ? some of the worst in memory . And now a @# @#  |p622  second drought ? this one not only dry but also searingly hot , scorching the corn tassels just as they 're pollinating . No pollination , no kernels . No kernels , no corn crop . I scan the sky . Not a cloud to be seen . I 'm learning , as you never do in the city , about the menace of an empty sky . At times I seemed to be writing a disaster story . You 'd think that Iowa farmers , coming off 1979 's record harvest , would have plenty of money to plant the next spring 's crop . But not so . Last year 's bin buster became this year 's glut . Even before the Soviet grain embargo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 cents a bushel below what they cost to produce . Farmers who could afford to were holding their old grain , waiting for prices to rise . Meanwhile , they needed cash loans to put in the new crop . But interest rates were astronomical . So were costs for seed , fertilizer , pesticides , fuel , and machinery . A few farmers were robbing the kitchen till to buy seed , then lining up for food stamps . Think of it ? food stamps for farmers ! Despite it all , the 1980 crops went in -- and they went in fencerow to fencerow , the most acres planted in Iowa history . Why corn ? Why beans ? " Heck , " says my father-in-law . Crawford County farmer E. Paul " Jake " Jacobson , " we could plant the state clear across with wheat . But there 's no reason to waste good Iowa land and rainfall on wheat , which can grow fine in drier areas . Our soils and climate are perfect for corn and soybeans . We raise primarily corn because it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corn 'll give you two to four times more bushels per acre than wheat . " Then why soybeans ? " Because , by rotating with soybeans , you control corn pests and diversify your crops so you do n't get wiped out by , say , a corn blight . Beans also return nitrogen to the soil . And , next to corn , they 're the best source of food energy . Once the oil has been extracted , the meal becomes a high-protein food @#  |p623  supplement for livestock ? hogs and cattle . " Iowa 's big in pork and beef , of course , because this is where the corn is . Nothing matches corn-fed meat for quality , and you may as well feed the animals Iowa corn right here in Iowa as pay the costs of shipping it out to fatten ' em elsewhere . " So , you see , it all comes back to corn . " These are Jake 's beans I 'm walking . He cautions me not to kill the occasional milkweeds among the rows . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarch butterflies lay their eggs . Not that you need ' em to grow corn or beans , but who wants a world without monarch butterflies ? " Jake 's farm is an example of erosion control . Co-author of McGraw-Hill 's Agricaultural Engineers ' Handbook , he worked 31 years for the U. S. Soil Conservation Service ( SCS ) . In 1961 he bought the nucleus of this 327 acres near Dow City . " It was poor land , " he recalls , " rough and hilly , scarred by deep gullies and ravines , with hardly any topsoil . This is loess soil . Unlike most soils , you can bulldoze it around without hurting anything . The loess goes down 60 feet or more and , when fertilized , what 's down below can be as productive as the top foot . I bought this place to test some theories I had . " I designed hundreds of conventional contour terraces for the SCS here in Iowa . They kept the soil on the steep slopes , but they were crooked and uneven ? hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for efficient farming , level land with long straight rows is the ideal . Well , I wo n't load you down with technical details , but my theories involve restructuring the hills themselves by using what are called pushup terraces ? which do n't necessarily follow the contours at all . " After some bulldozing , the natural power of erosion goes to work filling in gullies and flattening out steep slopes into wide , 4  |p625  straight bench terraces ? perfect for modern equipment . By using underground tile outlets to control water flow , hardly a grain of soil is washed downstream . It gets moved around a lot but remains right on the farm ? where it belongs . " Really , the basic principles are nothing new . I 've seen 2,000-year-old similar bench terraces in the Philippines that are virtually erosion free . I 've just adapted the method to the needs of big farm machinery . " You can see the results . These beans you 're walking grow right over what used to be a 30-foot-deep gully . That cornfield up there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tractor on it without risk of tipping over . " And this system of benching will work wherever you have the right soil and slope conditions . It could turn millions of unused acres around the world into productive cropland . It 's already being used in Israel and Kenya as well as Iowa ? wherever they have deep , erosive soils . " We walk up to Jake 's cornfield , and he picks an ear off the nearest stalk . " Look at this , " he says . Despite six weeks with only a trace of moisture ? just enough to pollinate most of the kernels ? it 's fully formed . " But the kernels are all dented , " I say . Jake sighs . " Of course ! This is n't the sweet corn you buy at the store . It 's field corn , and it 's supposed to be dented . You can feed it to livestock or do a thousand things with it , but you do n't eat it on the cob . " Yet how can it be so big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jake plops the ear into my hand . " Take that to Bill Brown at Pioneer Hi-Bred in Des Moines , " he says . " He 's the one to tell you about hybrid corn . " Bill Brown holds an ear of corn with a special reverence . " Not bad , " he says , looking at the ear Jake gave me , which was produced from hybrid seed developed by Bill 's Des Moines-based firm , Pioneer Hi-Bred International , Inc . " Back before hybrid corn became available in the 1920s , " Bill explained , " a farmer like Jake , out in the loess hills in a dry year , would have been lucky to have any corn at all . Even the best land in a good season yielded only 40 or fewer bushels per acre . " In those days , farmers simply used kernels from the prettiest ears of last year 's crop to plant next year 's . Then along came hybrid corn ? the result of genetic experiments in inbreeding and crossbreeding . Pioneer 's founder , Henry A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can create strains specially adapted to virtually any soil and climate conditions ? including Jake 's . " Here at Pioneer we produce about a third of the seed corn grown in the U. S. ? more than 300 million dollars ' worth last year . " Farmers using hybrid corn on prime land can get 150 or more bushels per acre . Of course , they have to buy new seed corn every year . If they just use seed from last year 's crop , the yield goes way down . Only seed newly crossed each growing season has the vigor for top yields . " Bill held up Jake 's ear of corn , scepterlike . " You might call that a miracle , " he said . " And it 's a miracle that would n't exist but for hybridization . " Administrator in a Class by Himself Council Bluffs , Iowa , has a national treasure . His name is Raj Chopra , superintendent of schools . But do n't go looking for Raj in his downtown office ; he 's probably not there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may seem , these highranking city school administrators are out in the schools , dealing with teachers and kids on a personal basis . A few years back TV 's " 60 Minutes " blew into this town of 56,000 , just across the Missouri River from Omaha , and did a story on Council Bluffs ' school system ? rife with factionalism , low morale , and low student test scores . The show on national TV left Council Bluffs feeling put down , dispirited . Were n't school systems elsewhere also in trouble ? Why single out Council Bluffs ? Oldest of Iowa 's cities ? first settled by lead miner Julien Dubuque in 17 Mississippi River town of Dubuque combines industrial muscle with pa  |p626  Then along came Raj Chopra . Hired in 1978 to rebuild the school system , this energetic native of Pakistan did more than that . In less than three years he has helped boost Council Bluffs ' civic morale to heights undreamed of a while back . Raj is a positivist . Brightly colored slogans decorate his office walls : " Positive attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children grow . " " Learn the 3 p 's : pride , progress , &; positive thinking . " I caught the busy superintendent in his office between the classroom visits that take up more than half of his time . " When I was a boy in what became Pakistan , " he told me , " the country was in a civil war . Our home was destroyed , and I had to live in a truck . People were starving . Bodies were stacked in the streets . I would have lost @#  |p627  all hope , all faith except for my old grandmother . She always told me : Do n't lose faith . Believe in God and the future . Whatever you must do to succeed , it can be done ! ' " I 've lived my life by that philosophy . When I came to the U. S. , I learned even more about positive thinking . I learned that a poor man from a far country can make a success of himself by hard work . " Well , I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than teaching its children my grandmother 's message ?

Suddenly everybody 's proud to be from Council Bluffs !  |p628  " When people are proud ? and this is the whole secret ? that 's when they get things done . And in a country with so very much to be proud of , there 's no more important message to get out . Pride ? that 's my most important product ! " Well , it 's November , and the harvest is in . Amazing Iowa has done it again . Despite droughts and hail and tornadoes , despite every obstacle devised by fate and politicians to trip them up , Iowa 's farmers have tied the record for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion bushels . The second drought finally ended in early August . But the wheat , corn , and beans in many other areas ? Missouri , the Dakotas , the South ? were damaged or burned out altogether . In Illinois , traditionally number one in soybeans , the southern sector was struck hard by the record heat wave . For the first time in history , Iowa has surpassed Illinois to rank first in soybeans as well as corn . With both the U.S.S.R. and China also reporting poor crop production , grain prices have shot up to the point where most Iowa farmers should come out of this worst and best of years with a modest profit ? enough , anyway , for seed next year . " I do n't remember a year when Iowans profited more from other people 's misery . " National Geographic , May 1981 agribusinessman Maurie Van Nostrand told me . " But if crops had failed here , too , meat prices might have doubled by the next year . America can be thankful there 's an Iowa .

We 've got the facilities to ship directly to overseas customers . " When we had a freeze here in Iowa last September , I had calls the next day from customers in Japan , Taiwan , and Belgium who wanted to know how damaging the frost was . This is big business . And Iowa is where the action is . If you 're talking corn and beans , you 're talking Iowa . " AGRI Industries runs the state 's biggest grain terminal , on the Mississippi River at McGregor .

Then we could double and redouble grain prices the way OPEC has done with oil . Would n't that benefit Iowa farmers ? " Jake nodded . " It might just work . But I doubt it 'd help Iowa 's farmers in the long run . Once big profits become a near certainty , the big corporations would move in and buy up the land . The family farm ? It 'd become obsolete , a fossil . Maybe it will anyway , but nowhere near so soon . " He squinted his eyes . " Let me make a different proposal for a different kind of future .
