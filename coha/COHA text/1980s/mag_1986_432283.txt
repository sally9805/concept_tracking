 | When was the last time your dentist remembered your birthday with a cheery card ? Does he ever stop drilling and give you a nice hug ? If not , you may be missing out on the biggest revolution in dentistry since laughing gas . Disappearing is the starched Main Street dentist from the old " drill , fill and bill " school . In his place is a guy who has shed his white coat for leisure wear , who has gone beyond his dental training to study the secrets of Madison Avenue , who has learned to perfect his chairside manner by giving patients a single red rose along with the sermon on flossing . Consider Dr. Thomas Kauffman of Atlanta , who throws parties for his patients at Christmas and sends them a chatty newsletter containing his favorite recipes ; or Dr. Bruce Jay Lewin of Bridgewater , N.J. , who provides lunch and limo service . " All dentists are pretty much the same as far as level of competence , " maintains Dr. Alan Marx of Washington , who serves coffee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he believes , is the little things they say and do to keep people comfortable . Not that it 's just the patient 's well-being that 's a concern these days : competition among dentists is fiercer than ever , and the extras they 're dispensing are , in many cases , simply a method of staying afloat financially . In 1985 there were 135,000 dentists practicing , up from 96,000 in 1965 . During the same 20 years meanwhile , fluoridation and improved oral hygiene led to a 50 percent drop in tooth decay . In the so-called cavity-prone years from 5 to 17 , 37 percent of American kids no longer have any cavities at all ? a serious erosion of the dental workload . Where can a struggling but enterprising dentist turn ? To marketing . " Convenience is today 's word , " says Cleveland 's Dr. Edward Meckler , whose chain of 16 Family Dental Centers in Sears stores around the country are open 7 days a week , up to 11 hours each day . Patients are given a beeper so that they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see them . Some of the centers solicit customers with a costumed " tooth fairy " who roams malls handing out free toothbrushes . The Dental Office , an independent eight-chair clinic in the huge shopping plaza in Cherry Hill , N.J. , runs on-screen ads at local movie theaters , promising that " we cater to cowards . " The dentists there also stage occasional " promotions " during which they offer a free bike with every set of braces . Many dentists eschew the hard sell , however , and focus on keeping patients hap- py ? and then getting referrals by word of mouth . Dr. Joe Greer , a Manhattan dentist , offers headphones and cassette tapes of birdcalls , ocean waves and other sounds designed to encourage relaxation . Dr. Bill Blatchford of Corvallis , Ore. , has seen his dental practice triple in the last five years by providing such services as chauffeuring patients who do n't drive . Washington 's Marx always calls his patients the evening after a routine filling just to see how they 're doing . Quest Forum Inc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . To make patients feel like more than just another set of diseased gums , Quest counsels dentists to give every patient a handshake , a flower or , yes , even a hug , at the end of each appointment . Pediatric approach : Perhaps no one personifies the spirit of the times better than Dr. Joseph Armel of Marin County , Calif. , who portrays the part of his office where he serves wine as Joe 's Bar and Drill , and offers lovebird clients a free " premarital cleaning . " Armel strives for the kind of dental care in which only the jokes are painful : " If your smile is not becoming to you , " his brochure says , " you should be coming to us ! " Other dentists have a more theatrical approach . Last Halloween Dr. Peter S. Aborn and Dr. Arthur Benjamin , partners in New York City , dressed for the day in tuxedos while one of their hygienists came to work as the queen of Sheba . " We 've adapted a pediatric approach to dentistry and applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all basically go back to being a child when we 're in a dentist 's chair . " But patients who really want to put their money where their mouth is visit New Jersey 's Lewin . The high-tech but homey Lewin Center is advertised in a glossy fullcolor brochure as an " anxiety-free world . " For " the extremely apprehensive " who may not respond to the friendly atmosphere and sylvan setting , there are , of course , drugs , such as intravenous Valium . No anesthesia , however , has yet been devised to dull the pain of the bill . An initial half-day consultation with Lewin costs $450 . That does n't cover teeth cleaning , but it does include X-rays and a videotaped record of your visit . Despite all the flashy innovations , most dentists do n't seem worried about losing their dignity ; it 's far more important , say some experts , to lure potential but fearful patients to the dentist in the first place . The American Dental Association describes marketing as a process designed to " meet the psychological needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients as if they were coming to his house for a brief visit . Kind of like the tooth fairy once did ? before she moved to the mall .
