 | Edward Eugene Garner was a 15-year-old with a stolen watch and money in his pocket and a police officer on his tail . " Halt , " yelled patrolman E. R. Hymon as the slight youth ran behind a Memphis house that had just been burglarized . Hymon pointed his flashlight at Garner and drew his gun . He thought the boy was unarmed , but figured he 'd never catch him in a foot race . Garner froze for a moment , then broke for the next yard . Hymon brought him down with one shot , the hollow point bullet striking Garner in the head , draping him over the fence . A fter a decade of lower-court controversy , the U.S. Supreme Court this week takes up the death of Edward Eugene Garner . Was it capital punishment for theft of a trinket , with Hymon serving as judge , jury and executioner ? Or did Garner simply pay the high cost of his business sooner than anyone expected ? Technically , the justices will decide only whether Garner 's father can sue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future of laws in about 20 states that give officers broad discretion to shoot fleeing felons . In practice , those laws tend to be narrowly interpreted by chiefs . Most cities now order their police to keep their guns holstered except when the felon is clearly armed and dangerous . Even Memphis has tightened its rules . But a decision in favor of unlimited police discretion could change the trend . " Law-and-order politicians will then urge a reconsideration of these laws , " predicts American University Prof. James Fyfe , a former New York cop , even though " nothing in the research suggests that a high frequency of police shooting reduces crime rates . " Constables have been killing felons in flight at least since the dawn of the English common law . In those days of highwaymen and forest poachers , all felonies ? the list was much shorter then ? were capital crimes ; killing a suspect , therefore , was not wildly disproportionate to potential punishment . However , as William A. Geller and Kevin J. Karales point out in their 1981 study of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the Salem Witch Trials . . . once the criminal law developed the presumption of innocence . . . lethal capture became problematic . " Today , virtually all jurisdictions allow police to use deadly force to stop a suspected felon who committed a violent crime , or who appears dangerous . The issue in the Garner case is whether that rule should extend to less dangerous felonies as well . Risk : Initially , a federal judge dismissed the Garner suit . But last year a three-judge appeals panel in Cincinnati held that the shooting violated the boy 's constitutional rights to due process and to be free of an @# unreasonable seizure . Both Memphis and the State of Tennessee appealed . " The fleeing felon has a ticket to his own safety , " says City Attorney Clifford Pierce Jr . " He can stop . He is risking his life by running . " Moreover , he argues , house burglary is a dangerous crime . In any event , Pierce says , it 's up to the legislature , not to second-guessing judges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Garner lawyers ? some of whom are from the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund , Inc. ? would like the court to adopt a rule that police shoot only when " circumstances " warrant it : in self-defense , for instance , or when pursuing a known , dangerous criminal . Failing that , they want the court simply to strike burglary from the list of crimes that could justify shooting . Their statistics show that 75 percent of all burglars are not armed and that 92 percent of all house burglaries occur when the home is empty . " The state needs a compelling interest to justify taking someone 's life , " says lawyer Walter Bailey . While this case will turn on constitutional interpretation , other issues lurk within it . Foremost is what impact shoot-to-kill policies have on crime . Limitations on pursuing cops , says Charles V. Holmes , a Memphis assistant city attorney , will just encourage felons to flee . Demands Bailey in reply : " How many burglars read the paper to see what the current state of the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year ago , the crime rate has registered no increase . Moreover , an amicus brief filed in behalf of the Garner team 's argument by the Police Foundation , a Washington research group , and 33 police chiefs and sheriffs , cites studies that show no link between lethal captures and lower crime rates . " Broad police deadly-force statutes actually work against the primary police responsibility to protect life and enforce the law , " the foundation argues . " Whenever police officers kill citizens , tensions between police and the communities they serve are likely to increase , especially when police take the lives of persons who present no clear and present danger . " High Rate : Even in cities with tight rules , civilians die : according to the Police Foundation , last year police killed 31 in New York and 11 in Detroit . But looser policies do make for more police-caused fatalities . Dallas , for example , follows the old Memphis model ; since January 1983 , Dallas police have killed 25 people ? 3.53 deaths per 100,000 residents , the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now considering a more restrictive policy . Unlike lawyers in other cases involving police , the Garner team may not be at a disadvantage before the high court . They probably begin with sympathetic votes from Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall , and have an excellent chance of picking up John Paul Stevens and Harry Blackmun . The fifth potential vote may seem unlikely only to those with short memories . Dissenting in an unrelated case 13 years ago , Chief Justice Warren Burger seemed to decide the issue : " I wonder what would be the judicial response to a police order authorizing shoot to kill ' with respect to every fugitive . It is easy to predict our collective wrath and outrage . . . a shoot ' order might conceivably be tolerated to prevent the escape of a convicted killer but surely not for a car thief , a pickpocket or a shoplifter . " By June , Burger will have to decide whether something so wrong can now be right . 69               @ @ @ @ @ @
