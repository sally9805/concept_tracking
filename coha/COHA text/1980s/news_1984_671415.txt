One possibility that companies are considering is to turn their corporate travel departments into full-service travel agencies , thereby gaining commissions on bookings . Others options include establishing joint ventures with existing travel agencies , selling tickets to employees for private travel and arranging for discounts from travel agencies and airlines. // 1982 C.A.B. Decision // These choices result from a 1982 decision by the Civil Aeronautics Board to deregulate the sale of airline tickets on the date the board goes out of existence , ending the 40-year-old system that allowed only airlines and travel agents accredited by an airline industry trade group to sell tickets. // The new approach will let anyone seek an airline ' s consent to sell tickets , and will liberalize the eligibility for collecting commissions . Thus , it offers businesses not only a reduction in travel expenses and greater control over business travel , but also the opportunity to turn travel departments into profit centers. // As yet , only the Allied Corporation has announced its intention to transform its travel department into a full- service agency that would also serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corporate travel , said the company expects to triple its current $9 million annual volume in airline tickets , while saving about $800 , 000 in expenses. // Corporate travel officers and others knowledgeable about the industry maintain that many other businesses will follow Allied ' s lead in the coming months. // " A lot of big businesses have such plans in the works , " said Richard Stein , a lawyer for the National Passenger Traffic Association , which represents the travel departments of about 800 companies . " But they ' re not ready to disclose it " until deregulation goes into effect. // Mrs. Macchia said that the corporations , particularly those that are seeking discounts on tickets they buy in bulk from airlines , are being reticent because the airlines they are dealing with fear retribution from travel agents. // On several occasions in recent years , carriers have been seriously hurt when travel agents refused to promote them to customers . Travel agents now sell 75 to 80 percent of all tickets for domestic airline flights , according to Joseph Hallissey , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // And some within the industry are opposing the new approach . Another industry group , the Association of Retail Travel Agents , has filed suit challenging the formation of the Airline Reporting Corporation , which is composed of airline and travel-agent representatives and will supervise the deregulated system. // The agents ' group contends that the system gives the airlines too much power over ticket distribution . But while that case is adjudicated , the new system will be put into effect. // <> <> Little Effect on Fares // Although deregulation could eventually bring far-reaching changes in the way tickets are distributed , there is agreement within the travel community that deregulation will have little immediate effect on fares or how tickets are sold and obtained. // " It ' ll be a non-event , " said Mr. Stein of the corporate travel group . However , he predicted that the business community would soon push for a larger role in ticket distribution. // One reason is that businesses , which provide substantial support for the $43. 7 billion-a-year travel-agent industry , stand to gain a great deal. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate travel group , said that a major inequity existed under the old rules governing ticket sales in that travel agencies collected commissions - the usual fee is 10 percent - for supplying tickets and other services to travelers . On the other hand , business travel departments , which performed essentially the same functions , received nothing , or , if they used a travel agency , a commission of only 3 percent. // The old rules stipulated that to qualify as a full-fledged travel agency - and thus , receive the 10 percent commissions on tickets - a travel department had to do more than 80 percent of its business with outside customers . The new rule lowers that threshold to 50 percent. // According to a recent survey by Louis Harris &; Associates for Travel Weekly , a trade magazine , businesses spent $23. 2 million in 1983 on all forms of business travel . Figures were not available for the amount spent on just air travel . The survey also determined that travel agents earn 53 percent of their income booking business trips. // Dan McKinnon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stand to gain from the deregulation of ticket sales in that they will be able to expand their distribution outlets and no longer fear the ability of travel agents to impair sales efforts. // One development being closely watched is the deal the General Electric Company made last April with Delta Air Lines under which the company buys its business-travel tickets at a 30 percent discount . Jack Batty , a General Electric spokesman , said that the company spends $100 million annually on business travel. // <> <> High Traffic Volume // The discounts on bookings , which are still done through outside travel agencies , applies to 28 Delta routes on which the company has a very high volume of traffic . Since Delta and G.E. signed their one-year contract , the volume of G.E. travelers has picked up by a third , Mr. Batty said. // Mr. Batty said that although the advent of deregulation was a factor in the arrangement , " the guarantee to Delta of a certain amount of business and the guarantee to us of a discount were the primary reasons " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , many corporations will continue doing business with travel agencies because they either do not have or do not want to develop the capability to take care of their own travel needs. // However , John Bacon , a Tenneco executive who is president of the corporate travel group , said that for many companies , " there ' s no question deregulation will open up the avenues to a range of different ideas on ticket distribution.
