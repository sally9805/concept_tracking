In New York City , the sleazy dealers peddling dope in Manhattan 's Washington Heights call it " crack . " In the south central part of Los Angeles , the desperate addicts chasing an ever more elusive high know it as " rock . " On both coasts , and in Chicago , Detroit and other cities throughout the U.S. , the drug by either name is an inexpensive yet highly potent , highly addictive form of cocaine that is rapidly becoming a scourge . Pushers sell pellet-size " rocks " in tiny plastic vials for as little as $10 . Smoked rather than snorted , a single hit of crack provides an intense , wrenching rush in a matter of seconds . " It goes straight to the head . It 's immediate speed , " says a former addict . " It feels like the top of your head is going to blow off . " <P> In minutes the flash high is followed by a crashing low that can leave a user craving another hit . But that evanescent electric jolt , priced so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug of the moment . The National Cocaine Hotline ( 1-800-COCAINE ) estimates that 1 million Americans in 25 states around the country have tried crack . From January through April , while New York City police seizures of marijuana fell off 92% from the year before and heroin seizures fell off 88% , cocaine seizures rose 41% . Crack busts already constitute 55% of all cocaine arrests in New York . In Los Angeles , where the drug was introduced around 1981 , more than two-thirds of the 2,500 coke arrests made this year have involved rock . <P> The rapid spread of crack leads some experts to fear a new wave of cocaine addiction in the U.S. , possibly as serious as the devastation wrought by the heroin wave of the late 1960s . Says Dr. Arnold Washton , director of research for the National Cocaine Hotline : " Last May I had never heard of crack . Today we get nearly 700 to 900 calls a day from people having problems with the drug . " Crack is more addictive than any other form of cocaine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the user 's nightmare . " <P> The drug is most popular in the inner city ; a recent survey by the cocaine hotline indicates that most abusers are men between the ages of 20 and 35 , and that more than half the nation 's so-called crackheads are black . In some instances , say experts , heroin addicts have turned to the seemingly safer method of smoking cocaine because of the spread of AIDS among needle-using junkies ; some of the seedy , smoke-filled " base houses " where crack is sold and consumed were formerly shooting galleries for heroin . But crack 's low cost has also made it particularly appealing to adolescents . Kids as young as twelve have called the coke hotline in desperation . <P> Cocaine addiction is nothing new in the U.S. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse , some 5 million Americans are regular coke users . But the traditional , sniffed " nose candy " is no match for crack . NIDA estimates that an addiction to regular coke develops after three to four years , while crack abusers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A snort of classic coke penetrates the mucous membranes slowly , circulating to the brain in about eight minutes and producing a high , much milder than crack 's , that lasts for 20 minutes or so . Crack is absorbed rapidly through the lungs and hits the brain within seconds in a dangerous , concentrated form .
