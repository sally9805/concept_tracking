txt " BE PART OF it now . Record your ' Message to the Future , ' " said a sign on the door at 5515 S. Sawyer Av. , the entrance to St. Gall 's Catholic School . In the school basement Friday and Saturday , a television camera was set up . Attached to it was a videotape recorder . Television tapes were being prepared for an audience in the year 2000 . If the past is any indicator , some of the members of St. Gall parish who think they will be alive to see the replay of their messages 19 years hence , wo n't be . Some of those who think they wo n't , will . " When it 's the year 2001 , will we all have laser guns ? " . asked Tom Langford , a 6th grader , talking to the camera and posterity . " I know the FBI has them Bow . " Marcella Slazyk , a widow , sat before the camera next to her longtime friend , Jim Goss . " I WAS IN school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made my first communion here , my confirmation here , and I was married here in 1941 . I came here to reminisce . " Mrs. Slazyk talked about " the four girls in our family , " including herself , who are all blind . Irene Hanrahan , another of the four blind sisters , also sat next to Goss as she poke to the camera . When she finished , a tearful Goss said , " I 've been the eyes for all of you . I hope when I 'm gone , you 'll find someone else to do it . " For $1 each , parishioners could speak for one minute . The taping will continue Sunday , and special events will be taped until next summer , when the tapes will be placed in a " time capsule " ? probably a bank vault  --  said the Rev. Michael Adams , pastor of the church . Some other messages : " I 'm Frank La Gigilia and this is my wife , Denise . We 've been in this parish , St. Gall 's ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife and I went to grade school here . We have four kids and one on the way . . . If this one is a girl ( he pats his wife ) , we 'll call it Joanna . If it 's a boy , I do n't know what we 'll call it . " Denise : " I 'm hoping we 'll be here to celebrate with you all in person . We wo n't be that old . I 'll be 53 , I think , in the year 2000 . Let 's sing happy anniversary . " They do . Another woman , glancing at her husband , said , " Our anniversary will be Oct. 10 . I 'll be married 34 years . I do n't know how I stood it . " And parishioner Jim Mussallem said : " I just hope in the year 2001 when all of you are together listening to this and watching this film that you all have one heck of a party .
