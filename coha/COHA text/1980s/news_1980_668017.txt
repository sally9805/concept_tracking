Quick . What ' s the nation ' s fifth largest state ? The richest state after Alaska ? The third fastest growing city through the ' 70s ? One of the biggest threats to Massachusetts hopes of keeping high tech development within its borders ? The answer is New Mexico and , specifically , the surging region around Albuquerque . This week , three top development officials from " the land of enchantment , " were in Boston , poking around , calling on bankers , talking to state development folk and , of course , to companies that are thinking of moving south . It was just another little scouting party , all part of the continuing war between the states for jobs and dollars . Politics in New Mexico tend to divide fairly evenly between the city and the country , between ranchers and city-folk . But both factions seem to agree that despite its relative wealth - with a surplus of $1 billion already , rapidly growing because of new taxes imposed on depletable assets , its bank account is second only to Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth of manufacturing . The ranchers - meaning the present administration of Gov . Bruce King - emphasize control , they say . Their nightmare : sprawling and altogether unplanned urban complexes like Phoenix or , even worse , Denver . In this respect , they say , Albuquerque has it all over its rivals , because it is just starting out , 400,000 persons and growing . " There is a once-in-a-lifetime point at which a state is developed , or decides to develop itself . We are there now , " said John B. Salvo , cabinet secretary of commerce and industry , leaning back and lighting another cigarette . " It was Digital Equipment Corp . ( DEC ) who really was the icebreaker , " said Albert Dietz , director of the state ' s economic development division . DEC is the granddaddy of all minicomputer companies . He explained , " When DEC moved in four years ago - the carrot was an empty plant , vacated by Singer - they helped us solve an image problem . Here was the top company in the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , they have in Albuquerque the only research and development facilities in the company outside DEC ' s Maynard , Mass. , headquarters . " We had to shed the image of a drunken Mexican taking a nap under a cactus in the middle of the desert , and it was DEC that helped us do it . " Not that there aren ' t plenty of Spanish Americans , sober ones without jobs , in New Mexico : Albert B. McCord , chief of the development services bureau , says that New Mexico ' s labor pool is perhaps the state ' s single best drawing card . " Our people aren ' t afraid of a long day . They want to work . They have good , dexterous hands , " said McCord . The biggest problem faced by New Mexico ' s developers , they say , is to steer away industries that bring their workforce with them . " The federal government is the chief offender , " said Salvo . Uncle Sam is the state ' s single biggest employer , with 23 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only jobs created for native New Mexicans are those sweeping out laboratories and office buildings , Salvo said . " We got plenty of rich people who made their money elsewhere who want to live here , " he said . In contrast , according to Dietz , the DEC plant in Albuquerque involved ultimately transferring only seven persons net into the state . The other 900 to 1000 jobs went straight to native New Mexicans , he said . He said other big new factories opened recently include a Honeywell plant ; a factory containing Johnson &; Johnson ' s Ethicon suture division ; an Intel facility , from Silicon Valley ; Pertek , a semiconductor company from Los Angeles . The state ' s most recent gain is the relocation the Davidson Rubber Co.from Dover , N.H. All three officials agreed that a " can-do " approach to development was relatively easy and straight forward in New Mexico . " When Johnson &; Johnson needed a road , the governor had to make exactly one phone call and that was it , " recalled development chief McCord . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip this week to Boston , then to Dover , N.H. , to congratulate his new constituents- to-be , but canceled at the last minute , according to Dietz . " Unless there is some subsurface situation that we don ' t foresee , " said Secretary of Commerce and Industry Salvo , referring to the state ' s precarious water situation , " during the next couple years there are going to be some big strikes . " He wasn ' t talking about labor problems .
