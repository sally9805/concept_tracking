Cases before the House ethics committee are stacking up like planes at Washington 's National Airport , and so are the embarrassments for Congress . After the committee investigates Georgia Republican Newt Gingrich for a questionable book deal , it must consider Ohio Republican Donald Lukens , convicted in May of having sex with a 16-year-old girl . Then it will weigh the case of Illinois Democrat Gus Savage , accused of fondling an unwilling Peace Corps volunteer during a March trip to Zaire . Last week the committee agreed to investigate Massachusetts Democrat Barney Frank , who has admitted that he had an affair with a male prostitute . <P> On a scale of 1 to HUD , Frank 's transgression is a low single digit : there is no suggestion that he used his public office for personal gain . In the eyes of some , however , private failings are far more serious : they go to a leader 's judgment and character , as Gary Hart and John Tower learned . For many people , the fact that the scandal involves gay sex makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homosexuality has shielded Frank from sharper criticism . <P> At the least , Frank 's judgment was appallingly naive . After an initial encounter in which he paid Steve Gobie $80 for sex , the Congressman says he tried to lift the younger man out of drugs and prostitution by hiring him to run errands . He wrote letters to Gobie 's probation officer and paid his psychiatric bills . He allowed Gobie the use of a car and sometimes his apartment when he was out of town . <P> After 18 months , Frank says , he dismissed Gobie upon discovering that he was bringing clients to Frank 's apartment . Two years later , Gobie tried unsuccessfully to sell his story to the Washington Post . He then gave the story to the Washington Times for nothing , in hopes of getting a book contract for the male version of The Mayflower Madam . This week Gobie will appear on Geraldo , discussing his prospects for a television mini-series . <P> While the House could censure Frank or reprimand him , colleagues and constituents so far have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minor , as it does with Lukens , or adultery , since Frank is single . It is an incident from a past secret life that has come back to haunt a legislator who is widely respected . Frank can debate and speak extemporaneously better than almost anyone else in the House , and he tackles some of its more complex problems like immigration and housing . Back home , he makes sure constituents get help from 18 staffers who track down Social Security checks and Medicaid benefits . Though he freely disclosed in 1987 that he was a homosexual , his district , which encompasses the liberal campuses of Boston and nearby blue-collar mill towns , re-elected him overwhelmingly in 1988 with 70% of the vote . <P> Massachusetts Republicans have jumped on the Frank affair , and the latest poll shows that only 45% of the Congressman 's constituents still look on him favorably  --  a blow but not necessarily a defeat , since 61% want him to run for office again next year . Alexander Tennant , Massachusetts G.O.P. state committee director , says the political issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congressman broke the law . " Gobie says he did , by abusing congressional immunity to avoid paying Gobie 's parking tickets , a charge Frank denies .
