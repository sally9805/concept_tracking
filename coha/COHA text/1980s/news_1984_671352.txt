For 11 days , beginning on Maundy Thursday , viewers reacted to " Christa " with emotions that ranged from joy to dismay. // The two sides of the debate agree that a statue depicting Jesus as a woman touches deep emotional and theological feelings. // Detractors regard the concept as a travesty against historical and doctrinal truth . The statue was denounced in those terms by one of the diocesan officials shortly after it was displayed. // The official , Bishop Walter D. Dennis , said in a Maundy Thursday service that " this symbol is theologically and historically indefensible . " He added that he supported " the woman ' s cause both inside and outside the church , " but that he considered the statue " symbolically reprehensible . " <> <> ' Totally Changing the Symbol ' // In an interview , Bishop Dennis said he did not object to " enhancing " symbols of Jesus by casting them in differing skin colors or ethnic characteristics . But he said the statue went too far by " totally changing the symbol. " // Supporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contend that the statue conveys the concept that women as well as men are called upon by the Gospels to share the sufferings of Jesus. // The advocates argue that this depiction fits in with many portrayals of Jesus reflecting various ethnic and racial traits. // They argue that a woman on the cross emphasize the teaching that God acted through Jesus to save all humanity , regardless of race , ethnic background or sex , and that the statue helps underline that point . <> <> ' Flesh on St. Paul ' s Words ' // // " Theologically , it is very important for this kind of thing to be done , " said the Very Rev. James Parks Morton , dean of the cathedral . " For one thing , it puts flesh on St. Paul ' s words that all Christians are to bear the cross of Christ. " // The dean , an ebullient man whose interests in the arts , science and social issues have largely transformed the cathedral into a cultural moveable feast , says unexamined sexist attitudes fuel opposition to the statue. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting women ' s ordination , " he said this week in his office . " I don ' t see anything really new here.

" <> <> Women as ' Suffering Servants ' // // A series of meditations at the seminary chapel last week centered on women in the Bible who are pictured as " suffering servants . " A clay sculpture of a crucified woman was displayed the chapel. // Prof. Tribble sees " Christa " as augmenting male " Christ figures " in art and literature . " We never have problems when we talk about males being Christ figures . We only get stirred up when the figure becomes a women. " // " Feminist theologians are challenging Christianity at points where it hurts , " she said. // Meanwhile , some Episcopal diocesan officials see the action by the dean as another instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offends a growing number of Episcopalians. // Dean Morton , who says most of the responses that he has heard have been favorable , chose the 4-foot , 250- pound statue as one of three modes of " feminine spirituality " to exhibit in the cathedral during Holy Week . <> <> To the Side of the Altar // // The figure , created by the sculptor Edwina Sandys , was placed to the side of the high altar , bathed in floodlights and set apart with ropes and two tall candle holders. // On the same day , Bishop Paul Moore Jr. conducted services in the cathedral and saw the sculpture for the first time. // An aide to the Bishop said he had made no public comment on the sculpture and was on retreat in California , unable to be reached by telephone . He will continue on sabbatical through the summer .

" It does not surprise me someone , somewhere would do such a sculpture , " he wrote , " either out of cynicism , smart-aleckness or a distorted devotion. " // " You may or may not know , and may not care , that many of us are forced out of loyalty to defend cathedral decisons many times a year , " Bishop Wetmore said .
