A rabbi 's wife uses TV to lure dropouts back to the fold <P> In Orthodox Judaism , a woman 's place is usually in the home . And all branches of Judaism tend to shun the high-pressure appeals used by today 's Protestant TV preachers . By rights , then , Esther Jungreis , tiny , intense Orthodox Jewish revivalist from Long Island , should not be in business at all . <P> Jungreis , 45 , bills herself as " the Rebbetzin " ( Rabbi 's Wife ) or " the Jewish Soul on Fire . " Others call her " the Jewish Billy Graham , " but unlike the Baptist evangelist , she does not seek converts from other religions . Her sole mission is to lure , cajole or otherwise summon secularized Jews back to their faith . <P> Her effectiveness stems from her evident fervor and a theatrical willingness to challenge Jews to a fully committed life . Listeners may be told that they are " witnesses to murder " because they are allowing a generation of Jews to " disappear in silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not free agents , she tells her audience : " You are links in an eternal chain . You belong to your people . " <P> Another part of her appeal is pure show biz . As a star platform personality , Jungreis comes on in flashy outfits of white , black or electric purple , wearing spike heels and heavy eye makeup . All that plus a slight Hungarian accent and blond wig make her look and sound a bit like Zsa-Zsa Gabor . Staid rabbis are sometimes scandalized by her delivery , which ranges from a concerned whine to a dramatic whisper . But lay listeners are held spellbound by her blend of polemics and pizazz . Sometimes they weep openly as she speaks about the possible fate of Israel or the loss of Jewish youths through intermarriage with non-Jews . " This generation suffers from Jewish amnesia , " she says . <P> <P> The Rebbetzin launched her unusual career in 1973 in New York . Now , besides speaking for her volunteer organization , Hineni , she leads consciousness-raising classes , is finishing a book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and answers 600 to 700 letters a month . Occasionally Jungreis will boldly park her " heritage " van outside a Hare Krishna or Divine Light Mission outpost and with a loudspeaker try to coax young Jewish converts into leaving . <P> Her latest project is a weekly talk show for the new Jewish National Television hookup , which goes to 50 cable outlets and a potential audience of 1.5 million . The Rebbetzin 's first show dealt with the Nazi Holocaust . Said Jungreis , who spent a year in Bergen-Belsen : " We must learn to speak of the unspeakable , to answer the unanswerable . We are a nation that actually descended into the abyss of hell and yet retained a spark of divinity . " <P> Other shows discuss the Jews for Jesus , what it is like to be Jewish in China and the Soviet Union . <P> Jungreis came to the U.S. in 1947 at age eleven and was later married to Orthodox Rabbi Theodore Jungreis . <P> Years ago she helped him expand his North Woodmere , N.Y. , synagogue from three to 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theodore admits it is rare for a woman in Orthodoxy to be a platform celebrity , but sees nothing wrong , so long as she does not usurp the rabbi 's role of conducting services .
