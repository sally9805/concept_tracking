Roberts ' City of Faith merges doctoring and prayer <P> Local politicians , ex-Football Star Roosevelt Grier , and Evangelists Rex Humbard and Pat Robertson attended . Barbara Mandrell sang the national anthem . There was a congratulatory letter from President Reagan . The festivities in Tulsa last week preceded not the kickoff of a football game but the opening of the City of Faith , the $150 million medical complex that Evangelist Oral Roberts claims he built on direct orders from God . <P> The triple-tower glass-and-steel complex , on an 80-acre site adjacent to Oral Roberts University in south Tulsa , houses a research center , diagnostic clinic and 294-bed hospital containing the latest medical gadgetry , including computerized patient records . There are such amenities as concealed bottles to collect patients ' body fluids , and redesigned gowns so that , as one staff member put it , " you 're not hanging around with your fanny sticking out . " <P> But the City 's main distinction is that it merges medicine and prayer , symbolized by a 60-ft. bronze sculpture of joined hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are required to take oaths to " exemplify Christlike character " and abstain from alcohol , tobacco and illegal drugs . While they minister to the flesh , specially trained " prayer partners " tend to the mind and spirit . Says Roberts : " We seek to saturate patient treatment in the atmosphere of the power of prayer , both medicine and prayer becoming a single and continuous act . " <P> The City of Faith will not renounce the hands-on healing that launched Roberts , now 63 , to fame 30 years ago . But , insists Orthopedic Surgeon James Winslow , the facility 's chief executive officer : " What we 're doing here is not a substitute for good medicine . We 'll stop the bleeding or patch the air leak in the lung and pray at the same time . " No medical procedures are expressly forbidden , but abortions will not be performed for birth control . The facility will draw its patients primarily from Roberts ' 3 million followers or " partners , " half of whom donated all the money needed for construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with his design specifications , were received in 1977 , says Roberts , while he was spending time alone in a Southwest desert following the death of his daughter and her husband in a plane crash . Carrying out the divine instructions was not easy . Roberts tells of devilish obstructions . On a visit to Israel , he says , Satan attempted to tumble him into the Sea of Galilee . There were mundane problems as well . Donations flagged , and local and federal groups objected to the project on grounds that Tulsa was already overloaded with hospital beds . <P> But in his hour of need , Roberts was not found wanting . Money started to pour in after the evangelist told of a visitation by a 900-ft. - tall Jesus who said , " I told you I would speak to your partners and through them I would build it . " And objections were overridden after state officials were hit with thousands of letters from Roberts ' followers . The evangelist says he persisted in the four-year effort because if he did not build the City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
