The White House could not have been more delighted . A generally vigorous economy , low inflation and a decrease in unemployment helped lift 1.8 million Americans out of poverty last year  --  or at least out of the category that the Census Bureau defines as poverty , which is annual cash income of less than $10,609 for a family of four . The bureau reported last week that the proportion of needy Americans decreased by nearly a full percentage point , to 14.4% , the first reduction after five years of steady increases . Said Gordon W. Green Jr. , assistant chief of the Census Bureau 's population division : " The reduction in poverty last year occurred basically for all demographic $ groups . " In a statement from California , Ronald Reagan said , " I believe these numbers are further proof that the greatest enemy of poverty is the free enterprise system . " The President , as ever , was optimistic : " The success of 1984 does not mean the battle against poverty is over ; it does mean that America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right direction . " The Administration sees the drop as a vindication of Reagan 's economic policies and a sign that a rising economic tide has actually lifted all boats , even the ones in danger of sinking . <P> Democrats , who have maintained that Reagan 's budget cuts have increased poverty , did not see the bureau 's report as an endorsement of Reaganomics . In a joint statement , Democratic Congressmen Charles B. Rangel of New York and Robert T. Matsui of California noted that the 1984 poverty rate was higher than for any year from 1970 to 1980 , that the rate for black children under six increased and that the gap between rich and poor was not getting narrower . <P> According to the report , real median family income rose by 3.3% , the greatest increase since 1972 . Poverty rates for blacks , women and the elderly also declined . Despite the gains , some economists suggested that the benefits of the economic recovery were not evenly shared . Claimed Robert Greenstein , director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The new Census data show that the gap between rich and poor in the U.S. is now wider than at any time since Census began collecting income-distribution data in 1947 . " Nor was Greenstein sanguine about the future . " It 's a one-year drop , " he said . " Unless we get an unusually robust economic growth , the poverty rate in 1985 is not going to show a significant decline . " The Census Bureau warned against both economic Cassandras and Pollyannas , forecasting that the poverty rate would continue to drop , but at a slower rate .
