Now the duplex question is arriving for many first-time computer buyers . They are not yet faced with the question of which second computer to buy , although that too is an eventuality probably on the way . No , the question at the moment is whether to purchase one disk drive or two . In the case of an Osborne , a Kaypro , Northstar or some other machine with two disk drives built right in , the choice has obviously been made for you . But when it comes to such popular personal computers as the Apple , the Commodore , or Radio Shack ' s TRS-80 , you will have to make the decision yourself . It ' s a rather important decision , too , because one disk drive may cost more than two low-priced computers. // So how do you decide , especially when the computer salesman makes owning a second disk drive seem as natural as having two hands ? The answer , like that to almost all questions having to do with the options available in computerland , is based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , while my Apple 2 Plus is equipped with two disk drives , I don ' t use the second one very often . My family uses the Apple primarily as a game machine or as an electronic tutor , running instructional programs on any number of subjects from math to music . Neither function really requires a second disk , nor , usually , does access to various data banks through the telephone line. // However , one area - and a common one in computing - where a second disk drive becomes a very handy accessory is in copying . Here the second drive may be considered a computer ' s private duplicating machine. // It ' s all too easy to destroy a disk . Of course , no one drinks coffee or soda while working at a computer terminal . But if someone happened to do so , and if someone just happened to spill a bit of either of those sticky beverages on a disk , then it would be bye-bye to whatever information was stored on that disk . You can ' t dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar misfortune , prying the volume apart and reading through the stains darkly. // Human error does not alone shoulder the responsibility for destroyed disks . Computers are fabled for their sudden impulse to " eat " a disk , or mangle its data . It doesn ' t happen very often ; the occurrence is usually limited to the one time you have no back-up disk . Thus the convenience of having a second disk drive available , so you can copy data from one disk to another at regular intervals as you ' re working at the computer console , usually justifies the purchase all by itself . It is often possible to make backups with a single drive . But under such circumstances , human nature being what it is , copying is often put off. // For word processing , the advantages of a second drive far exceed its convenience for simple copying . It is possible , for example , to have a whole library of pat paragraphs and boiler-plate sections stored on the second disk . As you write on the first disk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply and insert them at will , in the flash of a second , in your current composition . The repetitive boredom of writing form letters is also immediately obliterated by a second drive . ( Unfortunately , the boredom of receiving such letters is not. ) // YOU will also probably need two disk drives if your computer is to be used in a small business . Such popular business software as The Incredible Jack and Lotus 1 , 2 , 3 require two drives . The programs simply can ' t be run with only one. // If , after all this , you decide that a second disk drive is right for your computer , your next choice will be between simply another floppy drive and what is called a Winchester ( supposedly so named because I.B.M. , which developed the technology , first used the product code 3030 , recalling the Winchester . 30-30 rifle of the Old West ) . A Winchester , or hard disk , offers a great deal of added convenience and a tremendous increase in memory capacity . But it does so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cost you in the neighborhood of $500 to $1 , 000 , you will pay $2 , 000 plus for a hard-disk unit . The popular Model 6 from Corvus Systems , one of the premier manufacturers of hard disks for microcomputers , will cost you $2 , 495. // What do you get by paying almost five times as much for a hard disk enclosed in its own drive ? For one thing , the Corvus Model 6 holds about as much data as 50 floppy disks . Second , you get speed . Your computer will retrieve and display information from the hard disk much more quickly . Third , you get convenience . When you use a program that requires you to load the disk operating system ( DOS ) before you can run the program itself , you no longer have to spend the time involved in putting in the DOS disk , waiting for it to load , removing the DOS disk and then inserting the program disk . The DOS can be kept permanently on hard disks . So you need only put in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is the matter of networking . Several microcomputers can be hooked up to the same hard disk . In a small business with , say , one computer for the secretary who does the word processing , another for the accountant and a third for the shipping department , only one hard disk is required for the three machines . This brings down the cost to the floppy-disk-drive range . Not only that , but the secretary can get shipping information right off the disk to insert in letters , the accountant can do the same for invoices and so on . Again convenience and efficiency are the prime benefits . Just remember , no one said the choice of buying a second disk drive would be an inexpensive one . Nothing in computing is. //
