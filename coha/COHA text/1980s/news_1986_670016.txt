At a personal-computer convention in Las Vegas recently , people swarmed around the booths where clerks dispensed brochures on some hot new imports , personal computers from Japan , Taiwan and South Korea . Across the cavernous hall , hostesses for Data General Corp. struggled to round up an audience for their own product demonstrations . The contrasting scenes underscored a little-noticed development . After five years of false starts , Asian manufacturers have quietly invaded the U.S. personal-computer market . They have seized at least 20% of the $22 billion-a-year business , IDS America Inc. , a market-research firm , estimates . And their market share will soon balloon , predicts Raymond C. Ahlberg , an electronics-industry analyst at the U.S. Commerce Department . In many computer stores this past Christmas , the fastest-selling models were Japanese and South Korean . So strong is the demand for the machines  --  low-cost clones of the popular International Business Machines Corp . Personal Computer  --  that manufacturers have had to ration them to stores . Less dramatic but just as significant are the Asians ' gains elsewhere in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some of the U.S. computer industry ' s big names  --  Sperry Corp . , Tandy Corp. and ITT Corp. , for example  --  have begun buying some of the machines in their product lines fully assembled from abroad . Asian manufacturers now dominate certain markets for computer components such as monitors , disk drives and memory chips and are opening new forays into other sectors . Still other Asian concerns are investing in high-tech ventures that have promising computers or software products under development . Moreover , the Asian manufacturers are scoring big gains at a time when many of their U.S. competitors ' sales are languishing . A New York City retailer complains that he can ' t keep in stock the $1 , 795 transportable computer recently introduced by Sharp Corp. , of Osaka , Japan . Sales of the Leading Edge Model D , a new personal computer made by Daewoo Ltd. of South Korea and marketed by Leading Edge Hardware Products Inc. , took off after it was introduced in September and got rave reviews in three influential magazines , including Consumer Reports . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan , is a hit . A Kansas City retailer says , " The Epson Equity One is the fastest new computer out of the chute since the introduction of the IBM PC . " The Asians ' timing is excellent . The U.S. personal-computer market is especially vulnerable this winter to foreign competition . After seven years of turbulence , the market has settled down . IBM has established an industry standard for personal-computer operating systems , and , with a standard now in place , U.S. computer makers are forced to compete against one another by offering lower prices and catchy features . " The personal computer has become a price-sensitive commodity , " says Tim P. Bajarin , an analyst at Creative Strategies Research International , a San Jose , Calif. , market-research firm . " Asia ' s greatest successes have been in low-cost manufacturing of commodities . . . . IBM has given them a target to focus on . I believe they ' re going to make a big play for the market in 1986 and 1987 . " Moreover , computer buyers  --  both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to settle for a little-known brand if the price is substantially lower and the machine runs most standard software packages . Lee Spencer , who bought a Daewoo Leading Edge computer for his small electronics-assembly business in Silicon Valley , says , " The whole thing that sold me was the price . I wanted to buy American , but I can ' t afford it . For $1 , 500 less than a comparable IBM , I got a reliable machine that runs the software I need . " Similarly , Helene Curtis Industries Inc. , a Chicago-based cosmetics concern , says it plans to spend its " six-figure budget " for personal computers on Epson ' s Equity One . " Why pay the price for IBM ? " says Ron Gidwitz , its chief executive officer . " We can ' t find anything you can ' t do on the Epson that you can on the IBM Personal Computer . " Japanese computer makers ' entry into the U.S. market is being facilitated by their country ' s reputation for manufacturing top-quality cars , stereos and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a weak spot , the financially ailing U.S. retailers . Thousands of computer dealers are in desperate financial trouble because fierce price competition has slashed their profit margins . So , to launch low-cost models , Asian manufacturers are offering dealers profit margins double or triple those granted by their U.S. competitors . They also are offering a slew of other financial incentives , such as cash bonuses for salespeople and free delivery for large orders . " I started carrying the Leading Edge computer because I can make money on it , and I ' m selling all I can get , " says William E. Alderman , the proprietor of ProfitLine Computers in Cupertino , Calif . Adds Jan Lewis , the president of Palo Alto Research Group , a market-research firm : " The dealer crisis of 1985 is like the gas crisis of 1973 , when the Japanese subcompacts suddenly got a lot of attention . It is an entry point . " In fact , however , Asian manufacturers had already gained entry , an accomplishment little noticed because their brand names generally aren ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they began marketing computer accessories such as printers and supplying low-cost components such as disk drives to U.S. computer makers . Only half in jest , analysts call the IBM Personal Computer an import because many of its components are made overseas . As price pressures mounted , U.S. companies turned more and more to foreign parts suppliers . In fact , it is almost impossible now to distinguish foreign-made and domestic products . John A. Young , the chief executive officer of Hewlett-Packard Co. , sees a " seamless division " of the market between U.S. and Asian companies . He views foreign competition in personal computers as a " real concern . " Already , Asian penetration of the market is contributing noticeably to the fast-growing U.S. trade deficit in all electronic products . The American Electronics Association estimates that deficit at $8 billion last year , up 30% from 1984 . In 1983 , the U.S. boasted a $1. 5 billion surplus in electronics . More specifically , a Commerce Department report indicates that the U.S. trade surplus in computers alone has shrunk every year since 1981 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first ever  --  but , ironically , the slump in the personal-computer business is slowing the decline into a deficit position . Although most of the Asians ' inroads have been in personal computers and so far no Asian company has seriously challenged American manufacturers in domestic markets for minicomputers , mainframes or software , the Commerce Department ' s Mr. Ahlberg sees a threatening trend . " What happened in calculators , stereos , televisions and videocassette recorders is happening in personal computers , " he says . " The Asians began by supplying the parts like the memory chips , then components like the disk drives , then fully assembled personal computers . Now , the Japanese are moving to establish their own brand names . " This is consistent with their strategy . They ' ll get a good , strong grip on the low end of the market , the microcomputer ; then , in the next year or so , the supermicrocomputer ; then , in five years , the minicomputer ; then , in 10 years , the mainframe . " Some of Japan ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. personal-computer market . Two of them , NEC Corp. and Fujitsu Ltd. , market computers in the U.S. on a limited basis , but their efforts are widely regarded as mostly a test . ( The companies are major suppliers of components such as disk drives and semiconductors , though . ) " We think the market is still immature , " says Takeshi Sakurai , the president of Mitsubishi Electric Corp. ' s Mitsubishi Electronics America unit . " Today , IBM has established a standard . Tomorrow , it may change that standard . . . . Some Japanese companies have not made up their minds whether they want to be involved in the eternal chase game with IBM . " Nonetheless , Mitsubishi is clearly determined to cultivate close ties in the industry . Last summer , it bought a small , $1 million stake in Microrim Inc. , a software publisher based in Bellevue , Wash . Other Asian concerns also are quietly making strategic investments . Daewoo of South Korea recently purchased for $20 million a 5% stake in Cordata Inc. , a Thousand Oaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ July , Sanyo Electric Co. , of Osaka , acquired a 42% interest in closely held Icon Systems Inc. , an Orem , Utah , marketer of supermicrocomputers . Sanyo is making Icon-designed machines in Japan . Few U.S. personal-computer makers are discussing publicly their foreign competitors ' growing role in the industry . They are afraid of offending longtime suppliers and of lending support to the semiconductor companies ' pleas for protectionist measures , which could raise their own costs through high import duties and import restrictions . But several months ago , John Sculley , the chief executive of Apple Computer Inc. , called Japanese competition " a concern for the long run . " Can U.S. personal-computer makers arrest or even slow the Asian invasion ? Some executives believe that the best tactic is to build highly automated plants that can slash manufacturing costs . Some analysts regard IBM ' s recent introduction of a new line of computer printers  --  manufactured at state-of-the-art plants in Lexington , Ky. , and Charlotte , N.C.  --  as an effort to hone its skills and recover lost ground . Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in technology , and particularly software , may hold the key . " The computer industry is not the automobile industry , " Mitsubishi ' s Mr. Sakurai says . " The industry moves very , very fast . . . . Auto makers do not introduce every year a car two times faster . Computer makers do . " He adds that " as machines get more powerful , it will take longer to create clones . " Right now , Mr. Sakurai notes , " there is a pause in innovation . " And that pause is proving an opportunity . Several Japanese companies , including Sharp , Toshiba Corp. and Matsushita Electric Industrial Corp. ' s Panasonic unit , recently introduced powerful portable computers that use much IBM PC software . " We can ' t get enough of the Sharp machine , " says Peter A. O ' Conner , the president of Executive Computer Inc. , a New York retailer . " Companies want an inexpensive IBM-compatible machine that their executives can take home over the weekend . The Sharp machine fits the bill . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world watch market , is pushing hard its line of personal computers . The company hopes that it will be aided by its success with computer printers ; it broke into the U.S. printer market with a machine priced 40% less than the then best seller , and now William Frank , an analyst at InfoCorp. , a Santa Clara , Calif. , market-research firm , estimates that Epson holds a third of the U.S. retail market for printers . Epson ' s new personal computers are IBM clones priced at least 30% less than IBM ' s PC , PC-XT and PC-AT . Dealers say Epson ' s Equity One poses stiff competition for IBM and Compaq Computer Corp . In another development that some analysts see as a disturbing portent , Hitachi Ltd. , a Tokyo-based conglomerate , recently began offering a series of software packages for engineering , design and biotechnology applications on the IBM PC . The Japanese entry into software is a matter of concern to Scott Cook , the president of Intuit , a software developer in Palo Alto . " Writing software isn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " It requires a team effort  --  software engineers have to be virtual clones  --  and extremely close attention to detail . These are precisely their strengths . When the Japanese put their minds to it , they will swamp us . " And amid all the turmoil , IBM , Apple and Compaq may soon face a slew of even more unlikely competitors : their own dealers . More and more dealers are introducing under their own labels lines of computer accessories and components , typically made in Asia . Even more worrisome to the U.S. manufacturers is the widely anticipated possibility that retailers will start carrying a low-cost , store-brand personal computer fully assembled in Asia . ComputerLand is said to be considering such a move ; the company declines comment . In any event , the overall trend toward increased foreign inroads " is scary , " says John B. Hatch , the spokesman for the American Electronics Association . He adds that Asians ' gains in the U.S. personal-computer market " are beginning to look kind of like a glacier , slow but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Journal
