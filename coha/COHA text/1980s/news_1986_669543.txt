Here ' s a rundown of the shows , based on previews , chats with producers , and industry talk . Remember , almost everything in the new season is subject to late changes , as the networks adjust schedules - even program concepts - in last-minute maneuvers to outsmart their competitors in a business where each ratings point means many millions of dollars in profits. // Life with Lucy is one of the most eagerly anticipated shows of the season - but anticipated with great apprehension . With so many Lucy reruns in syndication , the new Lucy will have to compete with a much younger and more agile screen image . And , even with the incomparable Gale Gordon once again serving as sidekick , can anybody really go home again in this fast-moving electronic age ? Miss Ball has surrounded herself with talent from her own production company as well as Aaron Spelling Productions , but the real creative spirit behind it all is Lucy herself . At press time , the premiere was not yet available for screening , but this critic , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed in taking Saturday night back from the baby sitters. // // The Ellen Burstyn Show , following Lucille Ball on Saturday , suggests ABC is really going after the mature crowd . Well , I fear the pairing will mainly make clear that Miss Burstyn , lovely as she is , can ' t hold a comic candle to Lucy . Nor even to Burstyn ' s co-star , Elaine Stritch , who plays - can you believe it ? - her mother . The show is a three-generational family comedy , in which Burstyn plays an uptight college professor whose students study in her home , where her daughter and mother also live . The pilot I saw is being rewritten , reworked , and scheduled later on in the series . That ' s good. // Our World has the dubious honor of going up against ' ' The Cosby Show , ' ' NBC ' s big hit . This newsmagazine , with co-hosts Linda Ellerbee and Ray Gandolf , blends newsreel footage from recent American history with eyewitness interviews with those who participated in the events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , according to Miss Ellerbee , ' ' It ' s supposed to be evocative rather than provocative . ' ' But , rest assured , if Ellerbee is involved , it will be stimulating . ' ' Our World ' ' sounds like one of the most interesting new shows on the ABC schedule . Now , if ' ' The Cosby Show ' ' will only move to another night . . . . // Heart of the City is still another cop story , this one with troubled teen-agers in the household . Robert Desiderio plays a widowed , crotchety Los Angeles policeman , impatient with incompetence . The several overlapping story lines are reminiscent of ' ' Hill Street Blues . ' ' The premiere episode is probably one of the best-written pilots of the season , and Desiderio plays the role with integrity and consistency . The question is : Can the show survive opposite ' ' Golden Girls ' ' ? // Sidekicks stars Gil Gerard ( who played Buck Rogers a few seasons back ) in an offbeat cop show about a policeman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert who , in turn , becomes his partner in crime-fighting . These two could make a winning pair , depending on the quality of the scripts - and the viewer pull of ' ' Dallas , ' ' airing opposite them. // Jack and Mike is a kind of yuppie version of the cult hit ' ' Moonlighting . ' ' Here , though , a young couple juggle careers and marriage with a casual , lighthearted air but a certain seriousness underneath . Jackie ( Shelley Hack ) is an earnest , crusading newspaper columnist , and Mike ( Tom Mason ) is owner of some trendy theme restaurants . They seldom see each other , working hours being what they are . To its credit , the program tries to project a social consciousness . But the premiere episode shows possibly too much sympathy for a man mistakenly charged with rape , without due regard for the rape victim . Perhaps the social consciousness still needs some fine-tuning . Even so , ' ' Moonlighting ' ' fans may find this show an amiable carbon copy. // Starman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Here ' s another show about a character from a different time and place who has come to Earth . Robert Hays , in the title role , must learn basic things about our world , with the help of a teen-age boy . ' ' Starman , ' ' based in part on the 1984 movie of the same title , starts out with pretensions to social criticism . But isn ' t that the way ' ' Mork ' ' began before moving into into science-fiction slapstick ? Even though it sounds like another hard-to-sustain concept , it ' s innovative enough to earn a test tune-in. // Sledge Hammer attempts to satirize violence . Sledge ( not Mike ) Hammer ( get it ? ) is a cop so trigger happy he fires warning shots over the heads of jaywalkers . As played with utter dumb charm by David Rasche , Hammer talks to his gun , uses excessive force wherever possible , and in general makes Rambo look like Pee-Wee Herman . His favorite charity is Toy Guns for Tots . Although the show may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hammer ' ' is funny . But hasn ' t anybody noticed that making jokes about violence tends to trivialize it ? Maybe I am being finicky , but ' ' Sledge Hammer ' ' will be treading on dangerous ground unless its creator , Alan Spencer , finds a way to leaven his humor with some acknowledgment of the seriousness of violence in our society. // Head of the Class stars Howard Hesseman , whom viewers may remember as Dr. Johnny Fever of ' ' WKRP in Cincinnati . ' ' Here he plays a substitute teacher in a Manhattan high school honors class , in which - horror of horrors - an academic study session is preferred over the class dance . He manages to change that and emerges as a hero . It might have made more interesting , though , if the serious students could have remained so , rather than caving in to peer pressure . But the premiere program denigrates the idea of serious study so thoroughly that I wonder where the series will take us . Maybe it should have been called ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suggest that studiousness is next to friendlessness. // Unfortunately , few of the shows seem strong enough to lift ABC out of its current third place in the ratings , unless some established shows on CBS , now in second place , falter . Even so , with the cost-cutting program instituted by Capital Cities Communications , the network ' s new owner , third place may be highly profitable to the company . <> <> Show times // A schedule for the series previewed on this page : // The Ellen Burstyn Show , Saturdays , 8 : 30-9 p. m. , starting Sept. 20. // Head of the Class , Wednesdays , 8 : 30-9 p. m. , starting tomorrow. // Heart of the City , Saturdays , 9-10 p. m. , previews 9-10 : 30 p. m. on Sept. 20. // Jack and Mike , Tuesdays , 10-11 p. m. , starting 9 : 30 p. m. tonight. // Life with Lucy , Saturdays , 8-8 : 30 p. m. , starting Sept. 20. // Our World , Thursdays , 8-9 p. m. , starting Sept. 25. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , previews Sept. 26 at 8 : 30 p. m. ; moves to regular time Oct. 3. // Sledge Hammer , Fridays , 9-9 : 30 p. m. , previews 8 : 30 p. m . , Sept. 23 ; moves to regular time Sept. 26. // Starman , Fridays , 10-11 p. m. , special preview Sept. 19 at 9 p. m. // Tomorrow : New NBC series. // //
