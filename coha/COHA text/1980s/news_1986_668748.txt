The Federal Aviation Administration is ill prepared to assure airline compliance with safety regulations and may not be capable of monitoring air carriers adequately for years , a congressional study said Wednesday . The preliminary report by the General Accounting Office was presented to the House aviation subcommittee at a time when the FAA already is under fire from many members of Congress for not having enough experienced air traffic controllers and airline inspectors . The GAO findings are in the second installment of a lengthy examination of the FAA ' s inspection procedures that started in 1984 . " In short , the FAA at present can not say with assurance that airlines are complying with safety regulations , " the GAO ' s Herbert McClure told the House aviation subcommittee . The report had been requested by Rep. Norman Mineta ( D. , Calif. ) , chairman of the subcommittee . He said in opening remarks that though Congress never deregulated airline safety , the FAA ' s " failure to respond to the new environment may have resulted in de facto deregulation of aviation safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  The FAA does not know how its inspector force is being used and how many inspectors are assigned to various sectors of the airline industry.  --  Training for inspectors is inadequate , with new training programs postponed because of the need to give new inspectors initial training . Training records of a sample of 17 inspectors in the Northwest region showed that none had received all the training considered necessary.  --  FAA regulations and handbooks for inspectors continue to be " obsolete , incomplete or ambiguous " and have resulted in varying interpretations of safety regulations.  --  An FAA computer system that is supposed to improve inspector staffing and distribute safety information has encountered numerous problems and " is unlikely to provide useable nationwide data for the next several years . " Though the report noted FAA plans to hire additional inspectors through the next fiscal year , it concluded that the agency is " ill prepared " to absorb such an increase . " It will be years before all the needed internal management controls , inspector training and . . . supervisory mangerial oversight will be in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it said . " Meanwhile , the FAA does not have an effective plan for dealing with its short-term problem of ensuring airine compliance with safety regulations while it is putting its long-term strategy in place , " the GAO said . Last summer , the GAO released the results of a survey showing that though some airlines are closely inspected , others are hardly inspected at all . It suggested that the inspection work force is too small to deal with the large number of airlines that have emerged since deregulation of the industry . Since then , the FAA has said it will hire an additional 500 inspectors and clerical support personnel . It now has almost 1 , 800 , about one-third of which are assigned exclusively to commercial jet operators . The agency also has revamped part of its inspection program in an attempt to standardize inspection procedures and has begun a series of in-depth inspections in which teams of inspectors focus on a single airline . The FAA has acknowledged there have been serious problems with its inspection operation , but senior agency officials say there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redistribution of the work force . During recent Senate hearings , Anthony Broderick , associate administrator for flight standards , cited some of the FAA ' s recent enforcement actions as evidence that the agency is determined to keep close watch on the airlines . Among those actions has been a proposed $9. 5 million fine against Eastern Airlines for alleged safety violations . Eastern has refused to pay the fine and has challenged the FAA to take it to court , disputing the " technical integrity " of the FAA inspectors ' findings . Meanwhile , FAA administrator Donald Engen has acknowledged that airline deregulation has brought changes , including the emergence of many new airlines , with which the agency has had trouble coping . " I ' ve got to look you in the eye , " he told one senator earlier in the week . " I don ' t have enough people to put a man in every cockpit or keep an eye on every man that turns a wrench.
