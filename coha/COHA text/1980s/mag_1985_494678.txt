MAN IN A MOLD Giacometti : A Biography by James Lord Twenty years ago James Lord published A Giacometti Portrait , a slim , shrewd , interesting book . Contrary to the sound of its title , it was the ultimate anti-biography . For Lord 's book was about himself as the sitter for a portrait , portraying himself watching his portrayer , as though he were a hare turning round to confront its hound . Only in this case the hound , the pursuer , the artist laboring toward the capture of his prey , was Alberto Giacometti . A portrait of Giacometti only insofar as he was engaged in the portrait of Lord , this book worked that very narrow channel of the artistat-work , shuttling back and forth between easel and model 's stand , excluding what went on outside the studio as though to show that the space in which the artist staged his work was the whole of his life . On this stage Lord choreographed the sadomasochistic exchange , the seduction and resistance , the psychological tug-of-war that was peculiar to Giacometti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Filled with this drama , the book was nonetheless quite clear about the impersonality of this passion , which is to say , the way that Giacometti had left a certain notion of personality behind and made art his exclusive labor of love . The artist who emerged from this Portrait was quite naturally the spiritual brother of that other postwar Parisian figure Giacometti resembled in so many ways , and with whom he was in fact in deepest sympathy : Samuel Beckett , who was also opposed to a cult of the person of the artist and had insisted , " What matter who 's speaking ? " Two decades later the author of that wiry , intense , anti-biographical Portrait has produced Giacometti : A Biography , a large , sprawling , garrulous book that is a biography indeed . Eager to rummage in the closets and peek under the beds , Lord 's book tells its readers about the " secret " of Giacometti 's sexuality , about the adolescent bout of mumps that sterilized him , about his subsequent ( and probably consequent ) swerve away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prostitutes , about his fanatical devotion to his mother and his unhappy marriage to a woman who bore the same name as hers , about his final fascination with a prostitute with lurid underworld connections . These " secrets " are known , of course , to anyone acquainted with Giacometti 's own writings about himself , or with any one of several studies of or interviews with the artist . They were Giacometti 's open secret , the stories he told over and over in the production of his own myth . He loved to tell about the prostitute who ran him down in the Place des Pyramides , breaking his foot and forever laming him . Giacomefti relished writing and telling interviewers about an early encounter with " reality " that made the pictorial treasures of Venice pale in comparison , a tale about his experience of Tintoretto and Giotto being utterly swamped by his vision of some young girls walking down a street in Padua . Lord 's addition to this information is a kind of breathless production of significance and suspense : What had happened ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply disturb the feelings with which he had previously been preoccupied ? . . . What was it that induced a sensation of terror and made Alberto feel as though he were having a hallucination ? What was it that seemed to tear a hole in reality ? Why were all the meanings and relationships of things changed in that one moment ? And what exactly . . . ? This gambit of the psychologistic , this rush of questions that seems to set the stage for some kind of answer , perhaps a theory , perhaps another order of explanation , is opened frequently in Lord 's book . It is never answered . And so it takes on the quality of the questions at the end of soap-opera installments . ( Will Laura marry Dr. Templeton ? Will Stella tell George that she is pregnant ? How will . . . ? ) Indeed , the narrative often proceeds in a style of the ludicro-dramatic : " On the 10th of July 1912 , " a chapter begins , in a modest brick house facing an unpretentious square in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name. : Isabel Nicholas . She grew up amid circumstances which could not possibly have led anyone , least of all the girl herself , to suppose that she might become a person of consequence in the cultural history of her time . A person of consequence ? Isabel who ? This is a woman with whom Giacometti lived for three months in 1945 until she ran off to London to join one of what seems to have been an endless number of lovers and husbands . Having remained a lifelong friend of Giacometti , she had the distinction of introducing him to Francis Bacon , whom Giacometti liked , although he found his painting distasteful . James Lord is very busy with this life outside the studio , certain that it will illumine the space within . And yet to the art itself , and to the issues of making art , Lord brings the stalest and most unexamined of notions about the " creative predicament . " As Lord discusses what he elsewhere terms Giacometti 's " Surrealist escapade , " he offers this : Giacometti 's Surrealist period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career . Though the sculptures of these five years may appear unlike those which preceded or followed , they were all produced by the same artist , whose creative imperative was served essentially in the same way by all the works he executed during his lifetime .. Such underlying unity is , of course. , the quintessence of every artist 's adventure . Of course . Every artist . Adventure . Creative imperative . Quintessence . TT IS not just because Alberto Giaco- metti resembled a character from one of Beckett 's plays that a biography of him seems so beside the point . It is rather that this " underlying unity , " which is , " of course , the quintessence of every artist 's adventure , " was startlingly absent from Giacometti 's . There was indeed a parenthesis in Giacometti 's career . It was not his " Surrealist escapade , " however , but a ten-year hiatus between the decade of his Surrealist work and the 15 years of his late career , a hiatus during which Giacometti produced no sculpture . That gulf separates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of almost any other artist one can think of , two completely different aesthetic conditions , giving rise to what can almost be viewed as two entirely different artists : the Surrealist before the war and the more-orless realist , Existentialist after it . And there is a third Giacometti , the one who was in fact at work during that long interlude , making torchieres and sconces for Jean-Michel Frank : Giacometti the decorative artist , aided in this production by his brother Diego . And there is a fourth Giacometti as well , the one who made the artist 's armatures , who supervised his casts , who finished his bronzes , who developed his patinas , and who in moments of frustration could be heard to expatiate in bars on the subject of " Alberto Giacomettis " and of how he , Diego , could produce them ? had produced them ? as well as his brother . Giacometti belongs to the postwar phenomenon of the arts , the arts aware of the maze produced by an " age of mechanical reproduction , " the arts awash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new consciousness of the " museum without walls . " This was the period when it began to become apparent that many voices might speak through the work of a single individual , and that one of the conclusions to be drawn from this is : What matter who 's speaking ? Four " Giacomettis , " and possibly five or perhaps six , spoke through that " same artist " of Lord 's confident description , through that supposed producer of " an underlying unity " for all the work . This is not the place to argue the specifics for the disunity of Giacometti 's production , to demonstrate the difference between a notion of art produced automatically , as it were ( " as though they came to me in a dream , " Giacometti wrote ) , and one of intense , obsessional concentration ; between the making of fantasy objects and the attempt to record real ones ; between a total impersonality of touch ( cabinetmakers executed Giacometti 's Surrealist works ) and the development of a **26;3041;TOOLONG of material . The symptom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sprawled on the floor , contracted to coincide with the flat plaque of the base itself , while the postwar work is vertical to the point of having almost fetishized that uprightness : the wider public , thinking " Giacometti , " thinks long , impossibly skinny figures , stalklike in their vertical rigidity . Just what is the single adventure that provides the unity Lord speaks of ? Lord 's man-on-the-street , commonsense aesthetics , his assumptions of unity in the face of evidence he never examines , are everywhere to he found in his book . Among other things this leads to a method of documentation that is not violated by a single scholarly reference , and to constant sneering at the critical performances of those men and women with a rather longer track record than his own for profound responses to the culture of their time . For example , Jean-Paul Sartre 's 1948 essay on Giacometti is condescended to asan " intellectual edifice erected upon the scaffolding of Giacometti 's own ideas , interpreting the sculptor 's endeavors as a felicitous example of Existentialist commitment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felicitous " to have by continually rejecting the possibility that Existentialism has any real explanatory power in relation to the artist 's work , terming this a " misinterpretation . " Or , again , Andre Breton 's discussion of a work by Giacometti as Exhibit A in his case for the Surrealist concept of " objective chance " is waved into inconsequence . Breton had spoken at length ( in his book L'Amour fou ) of the trouble Giacometti had with the head of this work ( a sculpture called Invisible Object ) , a trouble magically " solved " by the accidental finding of a mask at a flea market ( reproduced photographically in his book ) , the relation between the problem of the head and the " solution " of finding the mask serving as a lesson in the logic of the fortuitous . Lord seems never to have heard of this famous example , and instead , when speaking of Invisible Object , assures us simply that " the greatest difficulty , as one might expect , concerned the precise placement of the hands in relation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the intellectuals and poets of our time is nothing , moreover , compared to what he hands out to collectors and dealers . Aime Maeght we are told was a " liar , " Pierre Matisse is called " parsimonious " and " smug , " Gordon Bunshaft weighs in as " bumptious , " and G. David Thompson , " shameless and sly , " died " unmourned by any in the art world . " This will prepare us , setting the tone for the merciless handling of Annette Giacometti , the artist 's widow . Having neither the stomach nor the tolerance for the kind of gossip about Madame Giacometti to which Lord feels his task gives him title , I will instead draw what I think is an important , real-world lesson from what could be called the " conduct " of this book . Giacometti : A Biography contains some 50 illustrations , some of them of the dramatis personae , some , in fact most , pictures of the work . When this hook appears in France , it will carry none of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Here we enter the thickets of art publishing , which are thorny indeed . In France the various laws protecting works of art and their reproductions ? the droit moral and the droit d'auteurreach rather further than those of the United States . Here , the logic of property obtains , and therefore once an artist sells a work of art , it is the new owner ( museum , private collector ) who may give or withhold permission to reproduce it . In France the author of a work is thought to exercise a " moral right " over it during his or her lifetime , after which that right passes to the artist 's heirs . This moral right is considered to be absolute control over the fate of a given work no matter in whose hands , physically , it happens to be . One aspect of this right is the power to grant or withhold permission to reproduce it visually in any place whatever . ( Another , by the way , is the power to reproduce it physically in any number whatever ? witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter Roberta has steadily been making of her father 's sculpture . ) Annette Giacometti , in denying James Lord permission to supply his French readers with visual information about her husband 's work , is merely exercising her/Giacometti 's " moral right " to do so . B UT she can not do that in this country . Yet . In the United States a lobbying group called VAGA is actively seeking to push moral right legislation through various state legislatures . A version of this law has already passed , unopposed , in New York state . Lack of opposition to this law is generally a function of ignorance as to the meaning and implications of the statute , as well as a kind of blanket permissiveness toward artists , generated by some romantic notion of their creative needs . But in this instance , standing directly opposed to such largess to artists and their " right " to control their work is the entire issue of the free passage of information , whether that information is serious and scholarly , or frivolous and commercial . Unlike other kinds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " show " the object in question . In literary criticism , for example , this right is guaranteed by the " fair use " doctrine , permitting anyone to quote up to 200 words from any published work , without permission from its author . But it is not clear how to extend " fair use " to the reproduction of an art object , since to reproduce it is to picture all of it ( no matter how transformed by a change from its original medium to that of the photograph ) and not some very small percentage . This question is beginning to trouble all those who have watched the problems that the license to censor given by the " moral right " has caused in France ? in the publication of serious books , in the scholarly press , in museums . And those people watching that situation darken are worried about its unimpeded transferal to these shores . A hook like Giacometti : A Biosraphy does nothing but strengthen the hand of those who feel justified in protecting themselves by the " moral right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extremely high ? involving the life of ideas and of knowledge ? it is not just a silly , vulgar hook . It is a damaging one .
