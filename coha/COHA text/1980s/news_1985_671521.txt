Scientists stress that AIDS , or acquired immune deficiency syndrome , is not spreading randomly and that those who follow certain precautions face little or no danger . The virus believed to cause AIDS has been known to spread only through intimate sexual contact , the sharing of needles by intravenous drug users or via blood or blood products. // Of the more than 14 , 000 Americans diagnosed with AIDS as of mid-October , fewer than 1 , 000 were women . Male homosexuals and bisexuals , intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs constitute the so-called AIDS risk groups and account for nearly all the cases . The number of victims of AIDS , which causes a collapse of the body ' s disease-fighting ability , is expected to double in the next year . Half of the AIDS patients have died ; there is no known cure or vaccine. // Just how frequently , and by what means , the AIDS virus is being passed among heterosexuals remains clouded by uncertainties , but knowledge is growing month by month as patterns are discerned in the rising number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interviews with a dozen Federal , city and academic researchers , as well as recently published findings about women ' s risks of AIDS . Q. // How many women have AIDS ? A. As of Oct. 15 , the cases of 916 adult women with AIDS had been reported to the Federal Government . Nationwide , the proportion of AIDS patients who are women has remained around 7 percent for several years ; cases are doubling annually , but there are no signs of a sudden new surge of the disease among women. // In New York City , 447 women have been reported to have AIDS , as of Oct. 18 . Of these , a highly disproportionate 85 percent are black and Hispanic women , a reflection of the ravages of drug addiction among minorities , city officials say . Q. How have women contracted AIDS ? A. About half the American women with AIDS have been intravenous drug users who apparently were infected with the virus from shared needles . Only 126 cases , or 1 in 7 of all women ' s cases , have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners who were drug users . One in 10 women with AIDS contracted the virus from blood transfusions , which were not screened for AIDS until last spring. // New York and northern New Jersey show an unusual concentration of AIDS in both sexes that is related to intravenous drug use , especially among minorities . More than 60 percent of New York City ' s women with AIDS have been drug addicts . Q. How many women harbor the AIDS virus ? A. Federal experts believe that for every person diagnosed with AIDS , between 50 and 100 others , most of them still healthy , are infected with the virus ; hence , between 700 , 000 and 1. 4 million individuals may be carriers nationwide . In New York City , an estimated 400 , 000 to 500 , 000 - or up to 1 in 15 residents - are now infected , according to Dr. Charles Rabkin , an epidemiologist with the city ' s Health Department . About 50 , 000 to 100 , 000 women around the country , perhaps 40 , 000 in New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assume that nearly all the infected men and women fall in the known risk groups , but some who contracted the virus by transfusions or from heterosexual intercourse may be unsuspecting carriers . Q. What does infection with the virus mean ? A. All virus carriers , whether male or female , are presumed capable of spreading the virus , known as HTLV-III or LAV , to others through intimate sexual contact or transfers of blood . From 5 to 10 percent of them have developed full-scale AIDS within 5 years of infection , while another 20 percent have developed swollen lymph glands , weight loss and other symptoms of AIDS-related complex . Scientists believe carriers may be infected for life , but the percentage that will remain healthy or that will ultimately develop AIDS or other diseases will be learned only as time passes. // Infected women who have not become ill themselves have passed the disease to their newborns , and doctors warn virus carriers against pregnancy . Q. Is AIDS spreading among heterosexuals ? A. Only 1 percent of AIDS cases in the United States are attributed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , according to Dr. Harold Jaffe , the chief AIDS epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta . The average lag time between viral infection and development of AIDS is at least several years , so if the virus has recently begun spreading more widely among American heterosexuals , as some experts fear , this will only become apparent in the years ahead. // In central Africa , equal numbers of women and men have developed AIDS , but the patterns of transmission there remain poorly documented and the importance of sexual intercourse versus contaminated needles and other means of spreading the disease is unknown . Q. Are some sexual practices riskier than others ? A. Evidence indicates that a woman can contract the AIDS virus through vaginal , anal or oral intercourse with an infected man , but that some practices may pass the virus more readily than others . Anal intercourse often causes tearing of tissue and , many scientists theorize , may allow more of the virus in semen to enter the bloodstream directly . But vaginal intercourse is clearly the source of AIDS in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange of saliva with individuals who are likely to be infected , although no cases of AIDS have been ascribed to kissing . Most scientists consider a light peck on the cheek or lips to be safe. // The more different sex partners a woman has , the greater the chances of exposure to the AIDS virus . Some scientists also believe that repeated encounters with the virus may facilitate the development of the syndrome . Q. Do condoms prevent transmission of the virus ? A. According to the Centers for Disease Control , " consistent use of condoms should assist in preventing infection with HTLV-III/ LAV , but their efficacy in reducing transmission has not yet been proven . " Q. Can women transmit the virus to men ? A. The evidence of female-to-male sexual transmission of the virus remains sketchy , but Dr. Jaffe said , " We have to presume it occurs . " If so , it has occured only rarely in the United States : sex with an infected woman has been strongly implicated as the source of AIDS in only 16 men . In scores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected source . In Africa and Haiti , many men with AIDS report numerous sexual partners or frequent visits to prostitutes. // Most scientists believe that female-to-male sexual transmission is possible but much less " efficient " than the reverse . This is true of gonorrhea , which spreads from men to women more often than from women to men . And among homosexual men , the receptive partners in anal intercourse face the highest risk of AIDS infection. // Federal experts assume the AIDS virus can be present in menstrual blood and in cervical and vaginal secretions , although this has not yet been established . Q. Are prostitutes spreading AIDS ? A. Again , the evidence is scanty. // Studies have shown that some prostitutes , mainly drug addicts in American cities , are carrying the virus , but few if any men ' s cases of AIDS can be unequivocally linked to them . Studies of soldiers with AIDS who say they have had no homosexual or intravenous drug experiences , and of unexplained cases among civilian men , have found a frequent history of multiple visits to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use is rampant among the prostitute subgroup known as streetwalkers , and that studies indicate at least half of the city ' s addicts carry the AIDS virus . They do not believe , however , that any men in New York have contracted AIDS from a prostitute . Doctors at New York University Medical Center think one of their patients did. // Dr. Rabkin of the city ' s Health Department says the risk of a man ' s being infected by rare past visits to prostitutes is " nonexistent for all practical purposes . " But many private doctors say the threat of AIDS is a powerful reason not to consort with prostitutes . Q. Is artificial insemination safe ? A. While no cases of AIDS from this source have been reported in the United States , four of eight Australian women who received frozen sperm from a symptomless carrier of the AIDS virus have shown signs of infection . Experts say women should insist on frozen sperm from a company that tests donors for AIDS infection , preferably one that does not release sperm until the donor has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They generally recommend against the use of fresh sperm , although careful screening and testing of the donor should make this safe. // The Idant Laboratories of New York , the world ' s largest frozen-sperm bank , says it began testing the blood of donors for signs of the AIDS virus as soon as the procedure was approved last spring and had refused homosexual donors long before that . Q. How can a person find out if he or she is carrying the AIDS virus ? A. At present in New York City , the blood test for AIDS virus antibodies can only be arranged through one ' s personal physician . Doctors send the blood sample , without the patient ' s name , to a Health Department research program for testing . The presence of AIDS antibodies , when confirmed by two different procedures , indicates probable ongoing infection with the virus . City officials , concerned that people taking the test receive proper counseling about its meaning , are debating whether to establish anonymous testing centers like those in many other cities . People deciding to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection could be psychologically devastating and that some civil libertarians are concerned about possible breaches of confidentiality . Q. How can a woman reduce her risk of AIDS ? A. Leading AIDS experts at the Centers for Disease Control , such as Dr. Jaffe , advise against sex with men in the identified risk groups - bisexuals , intravenous drug users or hemophiliacs . Those who can not follow this proscription should use condoms. // " It ' s appropriate at this point to be very careful about who you have sex with , " said Dr. Michael Marmor of the New York University Medical Center . " Get to know the person well , and talk frankly about sexually transmitted disease . If there is any doubt about possible past exposures , both people should get themselves tested. " // But overall , Dr. Jaffe said , " the chances of infection for a heterosexual not having sex with any risk-group members are extremely low. " //
