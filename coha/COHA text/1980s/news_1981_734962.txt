txt AIR WISCONSIN , the commuter airline that has emerged as the major regional carrier in the central Midwest , now plans to phase out the last vestiges of its commuter era ? its fleet of 13 Swearingen Metro airplanes . The airline , which still has its headquarters in Appleton , Wis. , but flies routes primarily from O'Hare International Airport to . edium-size cities in Indiana , Michigan , and Ohio , will replace the 16-seat Metro with 50-seat DeHavilland Dash 7s . The Dash 7s are the four-engine , high wing turboprops that have become increasingly popular with expanding commuter airlines as the trunk airlines pull their big jets out of smaller markets . Air Wisconsin now flies five of the Canadian-built Dash 7s , has five more scheduled for delivery in the next 12 months , and has options on five more . THE AIRLINE also has options on three DeHavilland Dash 8 planes scheduled for delivery in 1986 . The twin-engine Dash 8 has seats for 30 to 36 passengers and is scheduled to go into production at DeHavilland 's suburban Toronto factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metroliners over the next two to three years , and the Dash 8 will become our primary plane , " said Air Wisconsin president Preston Wilbourne . " It 's a fine ' plane that meets all the environmental ( federal noise ) restrictions and is fuel efficient , " he added . Air Wisconsin , which expanded into some major markets abandoned by trunk airlines last year , was able to increase its system capacity by 50 per cent by adding the four Dash 7s . The airplanes , which constitute 27 per cent of Air Wisconsin 's fleet , represent 46 per cent of its total available seat capacity . BETWEEN O'HARE and Fort Wayne , the Dash 7 flies 12 of the 14 Air Wisconsin flights ; 4 of 6 to Toledo ; and 5 of 9 to Appleton . The option on the five additional Dash 7s will give Air ' Wisconsin guaranteed delivery slots . " We 're getting ( delivery ) positions so we 'll have airplanes available if we see a market become available , " Wilbourne said . " That way we wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spur of the moment . " The latest Air Wisconsin expansion occured last month when the airline added three daily round trips between Toledo and Columbus , Ohio , and two daily round trips from Detroit to Columbus . The routes are flown by Metros . THE COMPANY has not yet drawn up plans for utilization of its proposed 36-seat Dash 8 aircraft . " We do n't really have to make a decision on exercising those options until April of 1983 , " Wilbourne added . Air Wisconsin was formed in 1965 when North Central ( now Republic ) Airlines withdrew from Appleton , and during its first year of operation between that city at the northern end of Lake Winnebago and Chicago's'O'Hare International . Airport carried only 3,562 passengers . In the last few years the airline has specialized in replacing larger carriers in markets too small to support jet service . Air Wisconsin 's need for larger planes came when the big airlines began dropping laeger towns , like Fort Wayne , from their schedules . Air Wisconsin reported a profit of $4.3 million on revenues of $35.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent increase in passengers over 1979 , carrying 667,285 during 1980 . However , the airline 's load factor ( percentage of seats filled ) slipped by 11 per cent to 55.8 per cent last year .
