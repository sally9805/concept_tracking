For generations , membership in a college faculty has implied the enviable prospect of lifetime job security through the granting of tenure . Not anymore . Since the late 1970s , academe has suffered a Ph.D . glut as baby-boom enrollments leveled off while universities continued to churn out fledgling professors , particularly in the humanities , faster than the shrinking job market could absorb them . <P> Today the prospect of even steeper declines in enrollment further reduces the need for new permanent professorships . Tightened university budgets and lowered federal spending make salary money scarcer , and recessions in some states have brought budget cuts at public universities ( Utah , for example , will eliminate 95 faculty positions over the next three years ) . The result : with entrenched senior professors guarding the gateway to tenure , many junior professors are facing dim prospects and shaky job security . Meanwhile , many colleges are calling into question the concept of tenure itself . <P> While these issues go largely unresolved , universities are staffing classrooms in increasing measure with part-timers , creating a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors in California 's university system , the country 's largest , about 33% are temporary . Nationally , of 700,000 faculty , 30% of professors in some of the liberal arts are not permanent ; the percentages range downward in other fields . Emily Abel , a researcher at the University of California , Los Angeles , and author of a book on college employment , says of the growing race of gypsies , " They 're like any part-time employees that McDonald 's would hire . . . cheap labor that colleges and universities are relying on to save money . " <P> Consider Alice Roy , an assistant professor of English at California State University , Los Angeles . For five rough years she scrambled as a part-timer on various faculties . One semester she taught five courses at three different colleges , driving as much as 80 miles a day to keep all her teaching commitments . " I could get on the freeway and find I was going to the wrong place on the wrong day , " she says . Her average aggregate salary for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a fourth of the pay for a tenured full professor in the California system . In 1983 , Roy finally won a probationary tenure appointment at Cal State . Her income has improved to about $28,000 , but she still must sweat out the standard six-year probationary period , knowing that around 1988 it could end with one year 's notice to get lost . Says she : " It makes me nervous as hell . " <P> Well it might , particularly in chauvinistic academe , where males are generally considered far more likely to win tenure than females . Administrators claim that in using the gypsies , they are only doing what they have to do in the face of academe 's changing needs and hardening realities . Moreover , laymen and even some independent-minded faculty scorn tenure as a refuge for the insecure or the marginally competent . But the fact is that tenure or some analogous security blanket is basic to the role of the university as an arena of open inquiry . Scholars must be free within wide bounds to teach , write and research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convictions are congenial to their superiors or to society at large .
