An uproar in Munich over undress in a public place <P> All over Europe the Germans are famous as nude sun bathers . But at home in their own cities a certain sartorial conservatism has long applied . This summer , though , in the city of Munich , a terrible uproar arose as crowds of young nudists began nonchalantly strolling alongside fully clothed pedestrians in the famous 600-acre Englische Garten . The young strippers quickly became a major tourist attraction , even threatening to rival the rosy Rubens nudes in the city 's Alte Pinakothek . But the burghers of Munich were not amused . <P> It all began two years ago when young people started disregarding STAY OFF THE GRASS signs to picnic and sunbathe on the park 's green expanse . Next , a few students from the nearby university shed their bras . Panties followed , and some men forgot their trunks . Dips in the park 's crystal-clear waters became skinny-dips . But the real ecdysiast explosion commenced this summer . By last week , as temperatures rose , at least 400 nudes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , passers-by wearing street clothes were often hailed with cries of " Why do n't you take your clothes off too ? " <P> These goings-on , or takings-off , stirred the wrath of an archdiocesan layman 's group . In an irate open letter to Lord Mayor Erich Kiesl that drew banner headlines in Munich , the Catholic association declared : " The many nude people in the garden disturb and offend those decent citizens who want to use it for recreational purposes . " Many citizens agreed . Asked Housewife Ingrid Steinberger : " Why should I be forced to look at naked behinds ? " The letter also threatened vigilante action if the police refused to take steps . Equally outraged , though not notably logical , the forces of nudity argued back . Asked pretty Student Lia Walden , 24 : ' Why do n't those pious Catholics take offense at the naked putti and angels that dot our churches ? " Said another : " The majority of passers-by seem delighted to see us . " <P> So far , the police have steered clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polarization between the ashamed dressed and the unashamed nudes ! " exclaimed Assistant Lord Mayor Winfried Zehet-meier . " But if there are no indecent actions , nothing can be legally done . " <P> A leading Munich newspaper called a public forum in the park to discuss the issue . The main speaker , an attractive young woman , took the podium with breasts bare . Georg Schmidt , representative of the Munich police department , told a crowd of 2,000 that it would be " risky " to prosecute the nudists . " A policeman carrying off an unclad woman naturally would have to touch her naked body , " Schmidt explained . " Inevitably this would expose him to the charge of indecent acts . " The only solution to Munich 's touchy situation seems to lie in the rains and chilling temperatures of fall .
