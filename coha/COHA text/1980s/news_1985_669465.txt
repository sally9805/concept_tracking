But her eye is always watching , watching who ' s around and what they ' re doing . ' ' Why aren ' t you working ? ' ' she yells to two teen-agers she recognizes . And she makes sure she gets a satisfactory response. // Kimi Gray is a powerhouse among the 3 , 000 people who live in the Kenilworth Courts and Parkside Addition housing projects . She ' s receiving national recognition for her long list of accomplishments since 1974 - the students she ' s persuaded to go to college , the reforms she has fought for in the project ' s management , the new attitude she has inspired among tenants , the money she has attracted for renovation. // // She has been lauded by such congressmen as Rep. Jack Kemp of New York , who are holding her up as an example of what an individual can do to make changes that seem to elude the federal government. // And with the power of her testimony in Congress , a bill has been introduced that would provide seed money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Kenilworth-Parkside. // But she still remains Kimi Gray , a woman of low income who has managed against the odds to scrape together a decent life for herself . When she arrived at Kenilworth in 1966 , she had five children to feed , no job , and no husband . Taking advantage of a government program , however , she graduated from a business college , and she has worked most of the time since then with the District of Columbia ' s Department of Recreation as a youth counselor. // She is , she says , just ' ' a big dreamer . ' ' She takes little of the credit for herself , emphasizing that the improvements in Kenilworth-Parkside have come from the tenants who have been willing to work for change. // Kenilworth is in the part of Washington tourists never see . Across the Anacostia River from the marble monuments and museums , away from even the run-down charm of the 19th-century town houses where many of Washington ' s poor blacks live , Kenilworth and the smaller Parkside are stark 1959-vintage , low-rise housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehoused , raising their children with little hope of breaking the poverty cycle. // ' ' Kenilworth was one of the worst public housing projects , ' ' Ms. Gray recalls . ' ' The crime rate was up and rapidly increasing . Vandalism was bad . Trash was everywhere . The high school dropout rate was high . Police were afraid to come in here , because kids would throw rocks at their cars. // ' ' There was often no heat and hot water , ' ' she says . ' ' The project ' s management was more concerned with bricks and mortar than with people . City Hall was insensitive to our needs. ' ' // By 1974 , only two of the project ' s residents had been to college . But one day , she says , three high school students told her they wanted to go to college . Would she tell them how to go about it ? She said she didn ' t know , and she told them to come back a week later to give her a chance to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came back , and they brought five others . Gray had learned that many black colleges were seeking recruits so they could keep their federal funding . She was able to help the students fill out applications and look for scholarships. // Seventeen Kenilworth-Parkside students headed for college that year . Four years later , when nine of them graduated , the residents threw them a ceremony and party to celebrate. // ' ' In this city , if you don ' t have at least two years of college , you don ' t get a job , ' ' says Gray . ' ' If a high school student tells me he doesn ' t need to go to college , I ask him what he wants to have when he ' s 25 . When he tells me he wants a house and a family and to move his mamma out of the project , I ask him if he knows how much that costs and what kind of job it takes to get that kind of money . Then I show him what kind of education it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , ' ' and I take him around to colleges and just let him talk to the other kids . That ' s usually all it takes. ' ' // Now 582 project residents have gone to college . And many of them have gone solely because Kimi Gray was there to encourage them. // ' ' Back in 1974 , I had dropped out of high school , ' ' says Michael Price , one of those students . ' ' One day she ( Gray ) asked me what I wanted to do . I said I wanted to go back to school . She helped me get my GED ( graduate equivalency degree ) , and then she helped me get into Paine College in Augusta . I didn ' t do too good there , and I came back . But I told her I wanted to try again . She helped me get into Elizabeth City State University and then into the Howard University School of Architecture . She was always there to help me. ' ' // Having those students going to college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray says . Coming back on vacation , they would see the trash and rodents , the crime and graffiti . They wanted to do something about it. // In 1981 , Gray was able to get a $78 , 000 grant from the District of Columbia to hire all of the college graduates to clean up the project . When the residents saw what they could accomplish , they called a meeting and resolved to take over the project ' s management. // After obtaining permission from the mayor , the residents set up their own association , elected Gray president , and went through a year of training before they were allowed to take charge. // Residents were hired to fill as many jobs as possible . Residents voted on what they wanted , and an employment office , a health clinic , and a social service office were created . A new engineer was hired who was able to fix the hot water and heating systems . Now when something breaks , it is fixed quickly . Trash is picked up six times a week , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and residents are fighting drug trafficking by cooperating with police. // One of the telling signs of success of their work is the amount of money the association collects in rent , which is charged according to income . Before the residents took over management , 85 percent of the project ' s residents were on welfare , according to the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprises , which has studied the neighborhood . Now 35 percent are . For the first time in the project ' s history , the amount of money collected for rent covers the cost of operation , according to the center . The district government is now making money on Kenilworth-Parkside. // Gray has been able to win a $13. 5 million federal grant to rehabilitate the project ' s 464 housing units . Not content with letting a contractor do the work , the residents decided to form a joint-venture company with a contractor , so many residents could be employed. // That joint-venture company will be using another $1. 8 million grant to build 20 town houses .
