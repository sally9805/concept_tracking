Other Islanders rolled on the ice in glee , while some 15,000 fans roared out of Nassau Coliseum and turned Hempstead Turnpike into the world 's loudest parking lot . Said Rookie Ken Morrow : " I just ca n't believe we did it . " <P> Morrow was not alone . The Islanders were laboring under a well-deserved reputation as the team that chokes big .

Said Islander Garry Howatt : " If one more person reminds me of our reputation , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Islanders almost undid it again . They surged ahead 4-2 , then let the Flyers catch up . But 7 min. 11 sec. into sudden death , John Tonelli took a pass from Lome Henning and snapped it to Bobby Nystrom , who backhanded the puck into Philadelphia 's net . Said Nystrom : " I think that was the first backhand shot I ever scored on in my life . " <P> The team stayed up all night drinking champagne from the commodious cup . A few days later , 30,000 Islander fans ended up in front of the Coliseum in Uniondale , L.I. , for a victory celebration . " People are still out there honking their horns , " marveled Nystrom , who , like the fans , was still somewhat bemused that the Islanders had not blown it again . " It 's unbelievable .
