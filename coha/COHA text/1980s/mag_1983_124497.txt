The way his trainer and close friend Gary Iacini sees him , Atlee Hammaker , the San Francisco Giants ' brilliant young lefthander , is a snazzy Grand Prix race car . " Say you get yourself a Ferrari but it 's not working quite right , " says Iacini . " You put in new plugs and maybe a new transmission . That 's the way we , Atlee and I , looked at his body  --  as a machine . We improved the parts , so now the machine is working fine . What you need next is a good driver . We 've got one . Atlee now drives his own body . " // And , it should be noted , he 's driving it hard and fast . At week 's end , Hammaker had won nine and lost only three for the third-place Giants and was leading the National League with a sparkling 1.52 ERA . His strikeout-to-walk ratio  --  80 to 15  --  was also the league 's best for a starter . And three of those bases on balls were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in control and composure , " says San Francisco Catcher Milt May . " What 's most remarkable about all this , " says Giants Manager Frank Robinson , " is that he 's a 25-year-old lefthander , and lefthanders that age are usually wild . " // There is , in fact , nothing wild about Hammaker , on the mound or off . The son of a career military officer of German descent and a Japanese mother , he was reared in a highly disciplined family that functioned as a closely knit unit , despite a peripatetic Grand Prix-circuit sort of existence . Colonel Charles Hammaker , U.S. Army ( ret. ) , met Hammaker 's mother , Saeko , in Japan shortly after the Korean War . Atlee was born in Carmel , Calif. while his father was stationed at nearby Fort Ord . From there , the Hammakers  --  Atlee has an older brother and a younger sister  --  moved to France , Georgia , Pennsylvania , Japan , Kansas , Okinawa and finally to Washington , D.C. // After attending high school in Alexandria , Va. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarship . He , his wife , Jenny , and their golden retriever , Austin , live off season on a farm outside Knoxville . " We were a military family , " says Hammaker of his upbringing . " That was my father 's influence . And we were close , the way Japanese families are . That was my mother 's influence . I learned never to be satisfied with anything I did . I learned never to feel I was too good for anything or anybody Hammaker is , to this day , a soft touch for street beggars . And I learned to work hard for everything . " // Those early lessons have produced a supremely confident yet humble young man whose work habits would weary a dray horse . Concerned after his rookie year in ' 82 that he was tiring in the late innings , Hammaker approached Iacini , an assistant trainer with the Giants , about improving his stamina . Iacini put Hammaker on a Nautilus and weightlifting program . He devised 14 different exercises for him , many involving the latest training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as SportStick , Hammaker uses even between innings of games he 's pitching . Iacini had his charge running 220- , 330- and 440-yard intervals . And then , with Iacini 's approval , Hammaker adopted some karate routines he learned from Mike Krukow , a pitcher who moved to the Giants from the Phillies this year . Krukow had learned them from every pitcher 's conditioning model , Steve Carlton . Krukow , Hammaker and , lately , bullpen ace Gary Lavelle work out for 45 minutes before each game , emerging from the privacy of the 49ers ' locker room drenched with honest sweat . Then they participate in the team 's regular pre-game drills . // Hammaker and Iacini examine the functioning of the Hammaker parts after each start . " If his legs seem tired , we work on them for the next start , " says Iacini . " If his back is giving him trouble , we exercise there . If it 's his lungs , we go to the bike machine . " This extraordinary attention to detail extends beyond the merely corporeal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him working on positive thinking . We have him run miles alone , so he can get his mind together . " // As might be expected , Hammaker observes a rigid diet . After a starting assignment , he begins with steak to build up protein ; during the ensuing couple of days he switches to fish ; and then he devours carbohydrates  --  pancakes for breakfast , spaghetti for lunch  --  on days he pitches . // Originally Hammaker 's athletic skills seemed to be destined for the basketball court . As a kangaroo-ish 6 ' 2 " senior center for Mount Vernon High in Alexandria , he averaged 21.7 points and 12:3 rebounds a game . But in college he found that he was a ' tweener , a player not big enough to play center or forward , or adept enough as a ball handler to be a guard . A summer of pitching in Alaska , where he was 5-0 in the fast league there for college stars , persuaded him that he had a future in baseball . // Hammaker was signed out of college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he was traded to the Giants in March of ' 82 for a somewhat more established lefthander , Vida Blue . The trade is one Giants Executive Vice-President Tom Haller boasts of without provocation . Blue was 13-12 for the Royals last year and was dropped from the rotation after performing dismally early this season . In ' 82 Hammaker won 12 , lost eight and walked only 28 batters in 175 innings , despite his tendency to tire in the late going . // This year his natural gifts  --  a 90-mph fastball that either sinks or sails , a vicious slider and a confusing change , plus his ability to throw the ball over the plate  --  have been enhanced by his increased strength and by a useful tip he picked up from Giants Pitching Coach Herm Starrette . " He had a tendency to hook his wrist before releasing the ball , " says Starrette . " This caused him some soreness in the shoulder , because turning the wrist brought pressure there . I got him to keep his wrist level . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perfectionist , and he 's got it down now . " // Hammaker 's sharp control comes in large measure from the smoothness of his delivery and from his ability to concentrate so hard that even the noisy Candlestick cries of " At-lee ! At-lee ! " go unheard . But for all his intensity , while throwing the ball he looks as if he 's more interested in checking for crabgrass on the mound . Hammaker will get the sign from his catcher , go into his windup and then , horrors , look straight down at the ground . " I just do n't feel natural looking anywhere else , " he explains . " I 'll look at the spot where I 'm supposed to throw the ball and then look down . But just as I release the ball I 'll look up again and see the same spot . They tried to change this habit in Kansas City , to convert me into looking at the plate , but when I did it I felt my balance go all out of whack. " // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whack . Says Starrette , " There are times I 'll be watching him out there when I 'll swear I 'm seeing Steve Carlton pitch . " There can be no higher commendation  --  for Carlton .
