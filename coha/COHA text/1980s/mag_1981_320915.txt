TARZAN , THE APE MAN Directed by John Derek Screenplay by Tom Rowe and Gary Goddard <P> Bo Derek is an engineering marvel - translucent eyes , enigmatic smile , buoyant breasts on a lithe , lovely frame . But there is a stillness , an emptiness to Bo 's beauty that suggests that her proper medium may well be a Playboy photo spread . In movement , in movies , beauty is not enough-not even for a sex goddess . It must be animated by a glimmer of spirit , experience , desire . Inside the Bo ideal should be a real woman . Not yet . Not at all . She is form without content . <P> Now Bo , as producer and star , and her husband John , as director and cinematographer , have basted together a new Tarzan , which the descendants of Author Edgar Rice Burroughs tried futilely to suppress . The story is familiar and faithful : Jane Parker ( Bo ) and her great white hunter father ( Richard Harris ) trek through the jungle and find the Ape Man ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crinoline for Bo to shuck before cavorting au naturel with Tarzan or monkeying around with wildlife . <P> " I wallow in me ! " trumpets Harris , and he does indeed : he wades hippo-deep through the rank mud of his loopy monologues . The generously muscled O'Keeffe utters not an intelligible word-only Tarzan 's patented bull-elephant yodel . As for Bo 's acting , she sucks in her stomach to look pretty and chews her cuticles to suggest fear . Alas , all the displays of Bo 's body can not divert attention from the ludicrous ineptness of the enterprise . Nothing breaks a tumid erotic spell faster than giggling . <P> - By Richard Corliss
