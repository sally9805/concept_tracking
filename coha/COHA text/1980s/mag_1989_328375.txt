Vito Marzullo had the shock of his life last week . The former alderman , 91 , awoke one morning to find his own obituary on the front page of the Chicago Tribune . There was consolation in the encomiums by fellow pols , who hailed Marzullo as the " dean " of Windy City politics . The embarrassed Tribune , still renowned for its DEWEY DEFEATS TRUMAN headline in 1948 , launched an investigation of the gaffe . It turned out that Marzullo 's brother-in-law , who lived in the same building , had passed away .
