More than 15 , 000 new apartments and houses will be under construction in these programs by this time next year , the city ' s Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development , Abraham Biderman , said . The output is likely to remain at the same level for at least several years , he said . <> <> Less Federal Support // That pace would more than triple the annual production of government-assisted housing in the city during the 1980 ' s , when Federal support for low-income housing diminished sharply . On average , fewer than 4 , 000 units of publicly assisted housing were built each year over the last decade. // " We ' re on the eve of a housing resurgence , " Mr. Biderman said in an interview . " We ' re sort of in the season after the planting and before the budding . In the next 6 to 12 months , you will see thousands of new units budding all over the city. " // Even so , housing production will not be sufficient to meet the enormous need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . A study completed last year estimated that the city needed 231 , 000 more apartments and houses than the 2. 7 million it now has . Other estimates of the housing shortage are even higher . <> <> Suit Against the City // The Mayor ' s program has also been challenged by advocates for the poor . These critics , including a coalition of housing , labor and neighborhood organizations that has sued the city over the 10-year plan , contend that not enough of its resources are directed at the homeless and low-income households. // Mr. Koch and Mr. Biderman say they think the program balances the needs of the different income groups that need housing . They contend , for example , that the city must use some of its resources to help middle-income families , with incomes between $25 , 000 and $48 , 000 , because construction in New York has become so expensive that private developers rarely build for the middle class anymore. // Moreover , city officials say , 85 percent of the money and the housing in the 10-year plan will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual incomes below $15 , 000 , or to moderate-income households , defined as those with incomes between $15 , 000 and $25 , 000 a year . The remaining 15 percent will go to middle-income housing. // " This program literally is rebuilding Harlem , rebuilding the South Bronx , rebuilding parts of Brooklyn , " Mr. Biderman said . " These neighborhoods will not be recognizable five years from now . " <> <> Most Significant Initiative // The city ' s financial commitment is intended to offset a steep decline in Federal housing funds during the Reagan Administration . For decades , the Federal Government had financed most of the low-income housing built in the United States. // Half of the $4. 2 billion will come from the city ' s capital budget , with the remaining money coming from a variety of city and state sources . According to several national housing experts , New York ' s is the most significant municipal housing initiative in the country. // " New York has committed a much larger number than any municipality in the country , even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive director of the National Housing &; Rehabilitation Association , an industry group representing developers and bankers. // The plan , first outlined by the Mayor on April 30 , 1986 , includes more than a half-dozen specific programs created over the last two years by city housing officials . The programs involve distinctly different and often creative financing arrangements. // City subsidies will help create 66 , 000 new rental and condominium apartments and houses over the 10 years , officials say . Half would be for middle-income households and half for low- or moderate-income households . Most of the new housing for those making less than $25 , 000 a year would be created through the rebuilding of abandoned , city-owned buildings in Harlem , the Bronx and Brooklyn . <> <> Abandoned Shells Sold for $1 Apiece // The city also says it will offer money and other assistance for the moderate renovation and preservation of 186 , 000 occupied apartments , both city-owned and privately held . These rehabilitations will be performed under expanded versions of existing programs for low- and moderate-income tenants ; they involve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electricity , at a cost of as much as $10 , 000 to $20 , 000 per apartment. // In one component of the 10-year plan , the city has begun selling clusters of abandoned shells for $1 each to private developers , who will receive 1 percent city loans of up to $43 , 000 per apartment to completely renovate the structures and operate them at predetermined rents . Rebuilding the shells , which often have only foundations and exterior walls , will cost more than $60 , 000 per apartment. // In another portion of the plan , the city has hired large construction companies to rebuild unoccupied shells . The city will pay the entire cost and then turn the renovated buildings over to nonprofit groups for long-term operation. // The Mayor and Mr. Biderman announced yesterday that the city would expand this program , called construction management . Forty-two abandoned buildings are to be completely rebuilt in the Bronx , at a cost of $96 million , and 1 , 368 new apartments will be created for the homeless and for low- and moderate-income families. // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are visible from the highway . Mr. Koch said in a City Hall news conference that these structures , which he called " some of the city ' s most infamous abandoned buildings , " form the basis of many people ' s impressions of the Bronx. // In several other programs , nonprofit housing groups will renovate abandoned buildings , financing construction in part through the sale of Federal housing tax credits to corporations. // Rents in these programs are guaranteed by the developers and will be subject to rent stabilization. // After designing each of the plan ' s components , city officials then selected abandoned buildings to be included in them . They issued requests for proposals from developers , evaluated the proposals and selected winning bidders . The proposals were then sent to the city ' s Board of Estimate for approval. // More than 10 , 000 new apartments and houses have been designated for inclusion in one of the programs , city officials said . In some cases , projects have not yet been awarded to developers . In many others , developers have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged and working drawings are being completed. // Construction has begun on about 4 , 500 additional units . In the next 6 to 12 months , construction will begin on thousands more , Mr. Biderman said. // He predicted that , with more phases of each program to be developed and announced over the next few months , the city will be able to subsidize the annual construction of 15 , 000 new or completely renovated units for at least several years. // Yet even if such goals are met , housing is likely to remain in short supply . A study released last year by Michael A. Stegman , a professor at the University of North Carolina , and Carol Felstein , a former deputy city housing commissioner , estimated the city ' s housing shortage at 231 , 000 units. // That conclusion was reached by combining estimates of the numbers of homeless New Yorkers , of those doubled up with relatives and friends , and of those living in completely dilapidated apartments . It also took into account the 60 , 000 additional apartments that the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental housing , the minimum industry standard for a healthy market . The city ' s vacancy rate was 2. 46 percent last year. // Moreover , Mr. Stegman noted in a more recent essay , his estimate of the current housing gap was conservative . Other projections are substantially larger , as high as 630 , 000 apartments and houses . <> <> Critics Say the Poor Aren ' t Helped Enough // The Mayor and other municipal officials say the city lacks the financial resources , by itself , to end the housing shortage . Only a resurgence of financing from the Federal Government will enable the city to meet all its housing needs , New York officials contend. // But the Koch administration also maintains that its plan will significantly improve New York ' s housing market. // " The demand so dramatically outstrips supply that , no matter how much we do , the demand will exceed it , " Mr. Biderman said . " On the other hand , by the time this program is fully under way , there will be a visible impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s or renter ' s market , but there will be options out there where none exists today , particularly for people making $25 , 000 or less. " // The question of who will benefit from the 10-year plan has been debated since it was announced . Many critics contend that not enough of the city ' s money will go to poor families , who they say are in most desperate need of housing. // In a lawsuit filed in January , the Housing Justice Campaign , a coalition of groups advocating low-income housing , challenged the Mayor ' s plan on several grounds . The suit contends that the plan does not adequately address the needs of low-income people and of the homeless , and it disputes the legality of city subsidies to middle-income housing. // The suit also argues , on more technical grounds , that the city is required by law to study the cumulative environmental impact of the entire 10-year plan and to seek public approval of the comprehensive plan . City officials contend that the overall plan is merely an outline ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plan ' s components. // The critics say they fear that most of the new rental apartments and condominiums will go to households at the high end of each of the city ' s stated income categories and to people with incomes above the designated classifications . Many of these families will pay rents considerably above the average rents in their neighborhoods , they say. // " You are using public resources to heat up land and housing values in a way that will inevitably help increase the price of housing in those areas , and that will produce more displacement and more homelessness , " said Bonnie Brower , a member of the coalition suing the city and executive director of the Association for Neighborhood and Housing Development , a nonprofit advocacy group. // Mr. Biderman asserted , however , that the Mayor ' s program was balanced . " Most of the dollars are focused at the low end , " he said . <> <> Concern Expressed About Supervision // In some buildings included in the first rounds of one of the new programs - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will rebuild abandoned shells - the average monthly rent for a two-bedroom apartment will be $575 , Mr. Biderman said . Using a conventional standard , the apartment would be afforable to a household with a total income of $23 , 000 a year. // Other buildings in that program will have internal subsidies , in which higher rents will be charged for some apartments to make other units less expensive . About 60 percent of the apartments will be more expensive ; a two-bedroom unit will rent for $700 a month , which would be affordable to a family making at least $28 , 000 a year . But 40 percent of the units will rent for no more than $400 , making them affordable to households with incomes below $16 , 000. // The Housing Commissioner said the city ' s plan would produce thousands of new apartments for low-income households and the homeless , and would finance moderate renovation of tens of thousands of apartments occupied by poor people. // " You also have to deal with the middle-income population , which is not being addressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you don ' t and they don ' t have housing , they are going to leave . And if they leave , who is going to give us the dollars to pay for everyone else ? " // " I ' m not apologetic about the numbers , " he added . " I think it ' s essential if the city is going to thrive economically. " // Several housing experts said they were concerned about more technical aspects of the city ' s plan . Some said they feared that , because the financing for small private developers was tight , some developers selected for the programs may drop out after deciding they would be unable to make a profit. // Some experts also said city housing officials were expanding enormously the number of production programs under their supervision , and might be having difficulty making the transition . Municipal officials will no longer be able to oversee all details of each project , given the new scale of housing production , the experts said. // " There are a lot of little problems with the program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work them out in a timely , professional way , " said Michael D. Lappin , president of the Community Preservation Corporation , a nonprofit company created by a coalition of banks . The corporation is providing financing for almost all of the developers in the vacant-building program. // " The extraordinary thing is that we ' re sitting down and working these things out , " he said , " instead of pointing the finger at each other. " //
