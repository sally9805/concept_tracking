New Jersey made some unhappy educational history last week . With a go-ahead from an administrative-law judge , the state board of education voted unanimously to disband the local school board in Jersey City and oust all six top administrators . For the next five years , the district will be run by an all-powerful school czar named by the state . New Jersey thus became the first U.S. state to seize total control of a local school district because of educational rather than financial collapse . It may not be the last : five other states now have laws allowing takeovers . <P> Governor Thomas Kean , who last year rammed through a takeover law against tough resistance from teachers ' union lobbyists , administrators and school boards , said the decision would end " educational child abuse " in New Jersey 's second largest city .

Among symptoms of distress : 46% of ninth-graders manage passing grades on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 46% of the city 's 52,000 youngsters attend private schools .
