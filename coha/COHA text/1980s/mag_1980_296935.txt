Ever since , Patrick Lucey , 62 , has been a stalwart of the Democratic Party , a key reason why Independent John Anderson chose him last week as his vice-presidential running mate . <P> Most of Lucey 's life has been devoted to organizing today 's strong Wisconsin Democratic Party . A prosperous real estate developer , he became Lieutenant Governor in 1965 and won the governorship in 1970 and 1974 . A popular if not charismatic figure , he fought for environmental measures and earned the respect of businessmen by cutting taxes to encourage manufacturing in Wisconsin . <P> In mid-1977 Lucey quit his office to accept Jimmy Carter 's appointment as Ambassador to Mexico .

He was the other side of the coin . "
