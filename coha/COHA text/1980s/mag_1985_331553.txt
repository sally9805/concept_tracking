After more than two years of exile in the U.S. , Kim Dae Jung , 60 , South Korea 's best-known dissident , finally flew home to Seoul last week . Unlike Benigno ( " Ninoy " ) Aquino , the Philippine opposition leader who was assassinated at Manila airport in 1983 as he returned from exile , Kim survived the homecoming . But his arrival was anything but routine . In a rough-and- tumble airport scene , he and a number of prominent U.S. supporters were jostled , pushed and generally man-handled by South Korean security guards . <P> As Kim , his wife Lee Hee Ho , 22 U.S. companions and 50 journalists stepped off Northwest Airlines Flight 191 at Kimpo International Airport , they were met by about 50 security guards who tried to whisk Kim away . He refused to go along . He feared for his safety , he said , and preferred to proceed through normal immigration channels . After a heated discussion , the guards slammed Kim into an elevator and took him into custody . Several protesting Americans were shoved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Ohio and Thomas Foglietta of Pennsylvania , and Patt Derian , Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the Carter Administration . Said Foglietta : " It was a disgraceful exhibition of force and brutality . " <P> While the police maintained that they were simply trying to ensure Kim 's safety , they were also keeping him from seeing several hundred supporters who had filtered past police roadblocks into the main arrival building . Nor was he able even to glimpse an estimated 20,000 well-wishers assembled near the airport . <P> South Korea did live up to a promise not to formally arrest Kim , who has 17 1/2 years remaining on a 20-year prison sentence for sedition . The pledge was aimed at the U.S. , which had been so concerned about Kim 's safe return that it briefly delayed the announcement of a White House meeting between South Korean President Chun Doo Hwan and President Reagan , scheduled for April . When Kim was escorted to his Seoul home , he found it surrounded by guards . His activities , the government announced , will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Americans who were mistreated at the airport were outraged . Derian called on Reagan to cancel the Chun visit . The State Department promptly lodged a protest with Seoul , but indicated that the Reagan-Chun meeting would go ahead " as scheduled . " <P> Kim returned four days before elections for the 276-member South Korean National Assembly  --  timing that seemed calculated to bolster the opposition New Korean Democratic Party , formed last December with the help of Kim 's fellow dissident Kim Young Sam . Both Kims and twelve other opposition figures are forbidden to vote or run for office . To what degree Kim 's presence might influence voters remains unclear . Most are too young to remember his nearly successful 1971 bid for the presidency ; moreover , the electoral rules favor President Chun 's Democratic Justice Party . <P> More worrisome for Chun is Kim 's potential role as a focus for dissent . Only a few days before his arrival , an estimated 50,000 people attended a political rally in downtown Seoul . Afterward , 1,000 protesters marched through the streets chanting , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
