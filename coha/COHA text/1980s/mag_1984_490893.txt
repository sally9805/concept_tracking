Notes and Comment THERE 'S a tide in the world running in the direction of de  --  mocracy . Or perhaps " tide " sug  --  gests something too strong  --  too wide  --  spread , too close to irresistible . It 's more a seepage . It gathers quietly , like water from a spring , but then , sudden  --  ly , here or there , it prevails . In Por  --  tugal , an empire reaches its late end , and in the heart of the Army ( unlikely source ) a passion for liberty , and for liberty 's paraphernalia ( political par  --  ties , campaign speeches , ballot boxes ) , flares up , and before long a full-fledged democracy has come into be  --  ing . Or in neighboring Spain the dic  --  tator Franco dies , and the country blooms with free speech and a free political life . Meanwhile , colonels in Greece fold up their junta and make way for civilians to reclaim the seats of power . Even more extraordinary , in Argentina some of the bloodiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the murder of thousands and turned " disappear " into a transi  --  tive verb  --  docilely surrender their government to the people , thus sub  --  mitting themselves to trial for their crimes . As if bent on disproving the cliches about the reluctance of rulers and repressive rulers especially  --  to give up power , the Argentine military men step aside like so many latter-day Cincinnatuses , with the notable and remarkable difference that many of them , instead of retiring to carefree rural life , may wind up in jail . Mean  --  while , in neighboring Chile the brutal regime of General Pinochet trembles in the face of an onslaught of popular opposition . And  --  as if to prove that the passion for freedom can burn as brightly in resistance to left-wing repression as it does in resistance to right-wing repression  --  the people of Poland , though still held in bondage by Soviet power , continue , in the face of relentless punishment , to think and act like a free people , thus demonstrat  --  ing that the spirit of liberty , even when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take up residence in the human heart . Most recently , of course , it has been in the Philippines that the champions of democracy have been winning victories . There the dictator Ferdinand Marcos hoped to use an election to confirm his monopoly on power , but the device blew up in his hands , and the opposition may well end up with more than a third of the seats in the legislature . For the United States , this scattered but undeniable movement  --  sometimes checked but often successful  --  toward genuine democracy is certainly one of the most hopeful developments of re  --  cent decades . Wherever it occurs , it can save us from the hateful choice between the repressive right and the repressive left . Revolutions like the French Revolution , in which the revo  --  lutionaries merely replaced one form of repression with another , have been common . Revolutions like our own American Revolution , in which the revolutionaries founded free institu  --  tions , have been rarer . We have had to wait for more than two hundred years , it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here . Unfortunately , our own grasp of our principles seems in the meantime to have grown weak  --  er , and around the world we are to be discovered deep in the embrace of dictators , so that the believers in democracy find that they must fight not only the repressive regimes of their own countries but us as well . The democratic movements in Argentina , in Chile , and now in the Philippines are cases in point They are our natu  --  ral allies , and we could make common cause with them . They , of course , would have to learn to trust us , after much bitter experience . We , for our part , would have to learn a discrimina  --  tion in political judgment which has so far eluded us , and acquire a deeper faith in what , after all , are our own basic political principles . Liftoff SAM SCHOENBAUM gives the un  --  bu if ed impression of gumshoe rath  --  er than of scholar . He wears black shoes with brown suits , and talks like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in fact he is . He signs his writing S. Schoenba.urn , weighs facts like evidence that may crack a tough case , and is likely to answer a question by throwing one hack . He is , as it happens , Distin  --  guished Professor of Renaissance Lit  --  erature at the University of Mary  --  land , and in the card catalogue of Washington 's Folger Shakespeare Li  --  brary , which holds the largest Shake  --  spearean collection in the world , his own work is well represented , with en  --  tries for " Shakespeare 's Lives " ( the Las Angeles Times called it " a model for literary scholarship " ) , " ' William Shakespeare : A Documentary Life " ( " a masterpiece , " according to the New York Review of Books ) , and two dozen related books and monographs . The other week , on Shakespeare 's reputed birthday , Professor Schoen baum guided us into the stacks of the Folger , where he does most of his lit  --  erary sleuthing , to look at the oldest editions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got interested in Shakespeare , " he said . " It was in senior English at James Monroe High School in the Bronx . We read ' Mac  --  beth , ' which is the shortest of the tragedies but among the most power  --  ful . I loved it . Then I saw in the paper that ' Othello ' was playing on Broad  --  way . This was in 1944 . I was seven  --  teen . The play starred the great Paul Robeson as the Moor and a charismat  --  ic unknown actor  --  at least to me  --  named Jose Ferrer as Iago . I remem  --  ber it more vividly than what I saw on the box last night . After getting my Ph.D . from Columbia , I did n't go in  --  to Shakespeare for a while . I figured , How are you going to say anything that has n't been said already ? ' So I cut my teeth on Elizabethan drama apart from Shakespeare , and did n't do my first book on the man until I was almost forty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest  --  ern , out near Chicago , I managed to get to the Folger a couple of days each month . It was like the New Jerusalem . It had everything . About eight years ago , I got the chance to teach nearby and I grabbed it . I live a few blocks from here , I 'm a trustee  --  what more can I say ? " In the library 's reading room , which is dark and Elizabethan , Professor Schoenbaum motioned for us to follow him to a sculpture of Shakespeare at the far end . " That 's a copy of the bust in Holy Trinity Church , Stratford , " he told us , in a stage whisper . " It was done a couple of years after he died , three hundred and sixty-eight years ago to the day . We know that for a fact . We also celebrate his birthday today , but there 's no proof that we 're right . Anyway , this is one of the two likenesses of him we can authenticate . With that mustache waxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a prosperous burgher . All I know is that it must have satisfied the family , because they paid for it . " On one shelf Professor Schoenbaum pointed out several different Shake  --  speare concordances . " If you want to know ' Where does he use that word ? ' these books will tell you , for the plays , the sonnets  --  everything , " he said . " It 's a mess of data , but it 's well used . " We asked if there were concor  --  dances in other languages . " All I know is that the biggest gang of Shakespeare scholars and enthusiasts outside the English-speaking world is in Japan , " he replied . " And there 's a Japanese journal devoted exclusively to problems of translation . A lot of prob  --  lems come up in translation , and not all of them have to do with language . Take ' King Lear ' in India . When Lear demands an affirmation of love from his daughter Cordelia and she declines the bid , people in India just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority and filial duty are un  --  questioned in their culture , and make that a difficult scene for Indians to cope with . I 'm sure the Chinese must have similar problems . " Professor Schoenbaum led us down two flights of stairs and through the gate of a thick steel vault . There was no one else in sight . In one corner of the stacks , on shelves from floor to ceiling , leather-bound volumes stood as tall as Webster 's Unabridged and half as thick . They were the library 's First Folios , the first full collections of Shakespeare 's plays . Printed in 1623 , they were the only source for almost half of the thirty-seven plays , includ  --  ing " Macbeth , " " Julius Caesar , " and " Antony and Cleopatra . " The Folger has seventy-nine First Folios , com  --  pared with the British Library 's five , and we asked Professor Schoenhaum why having so many was important . He waved his hands at the set , and said , " Each one is different . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve hundred  --  and there are only some two hundred and forty left from that whole first printing  --  the ty  --  pographer stopped often and made changes . Scholarship is process , right ? To understand what Shakespeare left for us , it 's necessary to compare ev  --  ery one of these versions with every other , and there 's still a lot to be done . Shakespeare is inexhaustible . " Professor Schoenbaum reached past the First Folios for the only known copy of the 1594 printing of " Titus Andronicus , " a slim book the size of a MAY 28,1984 paperback , which is the library 's most valuable edition . " It so happens that the play that most enthralls me  --  it just astonishes me , and it 's not the one people tend to pick  --  is ' Antony and Cleopatra , ' " he said . " To my mind , it just takes off . Remember that final image of Cle  --  opatra ? She puts on her robe and her crown ; she has immortal longings in her ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Wow ! You have liftoff . There 's only one authentic text , and that 's the First Folio . Now , in my Early Shakespeare course I start with Titus Andronicus . ' It floors the kids . Here 's this great play about the revenge of a Roman general and they do n't know about it , so they do n't have predetermined responses to it . Then , it 's so violent , and so strange . I like that . It shakes them up . Without this quarto , I could n't teach the play the way I do , because it varies in impor  --  tant ways from the First Folio . " Walking through the rows of Shakespeare 's plays , we had the sensa  --  tion of being in the shaft of a huge , rich mine , and we said we wondered if there might be something to the view that Shakespeare could n't have worked it alone . " There are people who say it could n't have been that one guy , " Professor Schoenhaum admitted . " The tragedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the range , the complexity , the richness of his characters : that one guy could n't do it . How could he ? He was the son of a glovemaker . He did n't go to a university . He wrote thirty-seven plays . If one man did that , he had to be a blue blood , like the Earl of Oxford , or a mover and shaker , like Francis Bacon . So who is Shake  --  speare ? The guy who wrote these plays really knew the theatre . He knew the meaning of silence , because the plays are full of brilliant quiet . He had a sense of what actors need to make plays live . The most likely playwright was a professional man immersed in theatre . The Earl was n't . Neither was Bacon . But Shakespeare was a play  --  wright , the most popular of his time . He was an actor , associated with the finest troupe in England . And he was a manager , a shareholder in his own company , a can-do type . There were n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question was " Can the Pan  --  da Be Saved ? " and Dr. George Schaller , who has spent the past three and a half years on this problem , was THE NEW YORKER to ask it a while ago in the Barbizon Plaza auditorium , in a lecture given under the auspices of ARC , the Animal Research and Conservation Center  --  a branch of the New York Zoological Society . The Zoo 's director , Dr. Wil  --  liam G. Conway ( he was labelled Se  --  nior Conservationist in . ARC 'S handout brochure ) , mounted the platform and made a few introductory remarks . Dr. Schaller , he reminded us , is a research scientist well known for his work on such animals as the mountain gorilla , the lion , the snow leopard , and the jaguar  --  and , now , the giant panda . He has just been named the first Wil  --  liam Beebe Fellow of the Society , and , said Dr. Conway , there could be no more fitting recipient . William Beebe himself was a keen scientist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his credit . Beebe , who died in 1962 , at the age of eighty-four , spent sixty-three years in the service of the Society , and published twenty-one books and over eight hundred major articles while conducting more than sixty scientific expeditions on land and sea . Beebe concentrated on the smaller forms of life , whereas Dr. Schaller has worked with large mammals in Africa , Asia , Alaska , and South America , but his spirit is very like Beebe 's , Dr. Con  --  way said , He is one of the army of ARC people who are to be found in many parts of the world today . Indeed . In the brochure we read about many of the projects in which ARC is currently engaged . There are twenty-five of them , and they range through Thailand ( the tiny Kitti 's bat ) and Africa ( the mountain gorilla , the African elephant , the mountain nyala in Ethiopia , the colohus monkey in the Kibale Forest of Uganda ) , and through the South American fur seal in Peru , the pudu , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the black-footed ferret in Wyoming . Everywhere , it seems , ARC people are investigating , observing , studying , recording , suggesting , and , perhaps , despairing , though Dr. Conway , of course , did not use that word . Instead , he gave us his favorite quotation from Beebe : " The beauty and genius of a work of art may be reconceived , though its first material expression be destroyed ; a vanished harmony may yet again inspire the composer ; but when the last individual of a race of living things breathes no more , another heaven and another earth must pass before such a one can he again . " Dr. Schaller , a tall , lean man , started his talk with a brief account of the giant panda 's history . It used to wander freely over eastern China and neighboring lands  --  wherever it found the bamboo on which it lives . The Chinese knew that it was there , but until the nineteenth century Western foreigners did not . Then an occasional explorer heard of it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much was published on the giant panda in European or American papers until Ruth Harkness , an American explorer , went into China 's interior , in 1936 , and emerged with a young giant panda . It survived the trip to the States , and here every  --  one who saw it was enchanted . In 1941 , the New York Zoological Society 's John Tee-Van went to China and brought hack two young giant pandas . Dr. Schaller showed us a few reels of motion pictures of the youngsters playing with each other , shoving and climbing  --  a sight that elicited fond chuckles . By 1951 , both of these pandas had died , without is  --  sue . As the brochure indicated , and as Dr. Schaller now repeated , there is a worrying reason for the giant pan  --  das ' rarity today in the wild . Not only is their habitat shrinking but there is a severe shortage of food for them . During the Pleistocene epoch , the ani  --  mal ranged throughout eastern China and south into Burma , but , we read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced its habitat so that it survives today only in a small area along the eastern edge of the Tibetan highlands in the Sichuan , Gansu , and Shaanxi provinces . " For years in the mid-twentieth century , the unsettled political conditions of the country prevented people from studying pandas in the wild , but at last , during the nineteen-seventies , Chinese scientists began intensive work on the animals , making habitat surveys and collecting detailed information . " An event oc  --  curred then that shocked conservation  --  ists , " we read in the ARC brochure . " Certain bamboo species flower and die at intervals of sixty years or more , nearly all plants in an area bursting into bloom at the same time . Since the panda subsists on bamboo , such mass death of its food source can lead to starvation unless other bamboo species are available as substitutes . " In 1975 , in the northern part of the panda 's range one particular species of bam  --  boo flowered and died , and at least a hundred and thirty-eight pandas starved to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or four years to regenerate . ) Later censuses taken by Chinese scientists indicated that only about a thousand pandas survived over their entire range  --  and more mass flowering of bamboo was expected . Realizing that one of its nation  --  al treasures was gravely threatened , the Chinese government invited the World Wildlife Fund to collaborate with its scientists in a conservation program , and in May , 1980 , a W.W.F. delegation , led by Sir Peter Scott , vis  --  ited the largest of ten panda reserves that still exist  --  Wolong Natural Reserve , in Sichuan . In December , 1980 , George Schaller went out to Wolong and joined a number of Chi  --  nese scientists Hu Jin Chu , Pan Wen Shi , and others  --  to initiate a study of the animals in the wild . The project , which is financed jointly by the Chinese government and World Wildlife , with contributions from ARC , is divided into three parts : captive breeding and research ; field work on the animal 's natural history ; and an emergency plan for dealing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at length by Dr. Schaller , but the two others were . MAY 28 , 1984 Between sixty and seventy pandas are held in captive conditions in China  --  in zoos and elsewhere . Their breeding record , while not blank , is hardly encouraging , so artificial insemination has been tried , with some success . For field work , Schaller joined a group of Chinese who had been staying since 1978 at a mountain camp , Wuyipeng , observing pandas . The pandas , who roam wherever they find bamboo , seem to have their own heats , and pay little attention to each other . Only during the mating season do they behave as if they were aware of other pandas , but in that time of rut many things hap  --  pen . A male panda in search of a mate climbs a tree and , for the only time in his year-round existence , utters a cry  --  with a vengeance . The noise is loud and strange , said Dr. Schaller , and to prove that he was not exaggerating he played a recording for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an in  --  describable sound : a medley of calves ' bawling , screams , and yelps in many different keys against a background of tremolo chirps . One could hardly believe that it all came from one species , let alone one , throat , but it did . After the encounter , the pandas all resume their unsociable ways . Even the male and the female do not stay together . However , during the mat  --  ing season there are further altera  --  tions in the pandas ' behavior : they seem quite indifferent to their sur  --  roundings , and move about in a dazed way . One nearly walked straight in  --  to Dr. Schaller while he was taking pictures . After a brief pause , Dr. Schaller continued , " So , should the panda be saved ? Can it be saved ? Certainly , as far as I 'm concerned . We only need to use our collective wisdom . . . . By sav  --  ing the panda in its habitat , we , of course , also assure the survival of thousands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area . . . . And , above all , by saving the panda , which is a symbol of world conservation , we express our commitment to and faith in the future . . . . We can only hope that our methods are the correct ones , that the panda will live forevermore in its mist-shrouded mountains . " Dig WE sat in a construction trailer on a vacant lot at 60 Wall Street one morning last week lis  --  tening as Edward Rutsch explained the archeological dig he is directing on the site . THE NEW YORKER " What are you look ing for ? " we asked . " Among other things , the wall , " he said . " What wall ? " " The wall Wall Street was named for . " " Oh , " we said . It had never occurred to us that Wall Street was named for a wall . But , then , we heard a lot of things for the first time during our talk with Mr. Rutsch . In two hours that were os  --  tensibly spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next few weeks , so that an of  --  fice tower can rise on the site ) , we learned that over half of all the agricultural products in the world , including tomatoes , potatoes , and tapioca , were first grown by Indians in the Amer  --  was , and that it was n't until after the Second World War that a real highway , Route 3 , was put through the Jersey Meadowlands , and that the staple of Barbadian cuisine is not papayas  --  it 's salt cod . Mr. Rutsch is an impressive man , and the digres  --  sions are not rocks in his rhetorical river but tributaries , swelling and deepening what he has to say . Were he sterner , and in tweed , he would seem professorial , and for some years he did teach in a college . " Then something dawned on me , " he said . " I do n't like school . Teaching in one was better than going to one , but not a hell of a lot . " Reflecting on Sam Schoenbaum and Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors . What Mr. Rutsch does like is dig  --  ging . He excavated the remains of the old mills in Paterson , New Jersey , and of the upstate ironworks where they made the Parrot guns for the Civil War , and quite a few other sites . Business has improved in recent years , as a re  --  sult of federal , state , and local require  --  ments that new projects prepare envi  --  ronmental-impact statements that in  --  clude descriptions of a site 's cultural his  --  tory . This particular site , which takes up most of the square block bound  --  ed by Wall , Pearl , Pine , and William Streets , lay at the northern edge of the Dutch city of New Amsterdam . The boundary was marked by the wall a wooden fence , built in the sixteen-thirties , largely with the proceeds from a beer tax . It stood twelve feet high and was garrisoned at six points with cannon . Designed to prevent land at  --  tacks on the fort down at the Battery , it soon had to he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " One time , fifteen hundred braves carne down and just walked around in the city  --  no one could do anything about it , " Mr. Rutsch said . " The Indians had already driven the settlers out of Brooklyn , and there 'd been the Peach War , up by Forty-second Street , when a farmer shot an Indian woman for stealing a peach . So the city was in real jeopardy any time the Indians got their act together . " In the late sixteen-hundreds , the British took over the city , and by 1700 they had torn down the rotting wall , mainly because , as the city grew , the land that the wall was on was becom  --  ing valuable . " If we found anything , it would probably be post-hole marks , " Mr. Rutsch said . " They 're the marks left in the soil where the logs , if they 'd been left in place , would have rot  --  ted  --  or where if they 'd been pulled out and filled with something else the soil would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stain in the earth . Maybe it 's not here anymore . Even if it is , it wo n't look much like a wall . It 's go  --  ing to be kind of esoteric . " The land where the wall had been was divvied up by the British into twenty-five-foot lots , cheek by jowl and inaccurately surveyed  --  the jags in the lot lines have lasted through the centuries . It was a fashionable block  --  one that Alexander Hamilton called home . Mr. Rutsch is hoping to find , buried under the debris of the last two centuries , the privies and wells of the early residents , which would have been dug deep . On the corner of Wall and Pearl Streets , there was a bolting mill , where flour was sifted through cloth . " New York had one of the first inspections of flour , " Mr. Rutsch said . " All around the world , if a barrel of flour was stamped ' New York Inspect  --  ed ' people knew that it would be pure white and perfectly clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that white flour may not be the best thing for you . " Mr. Rutsch led us outside to watch his assistants screening the dirt . Ear  --  lier in the morning , one had un  --  covered a French gunflint , of the type used during the Revolution . Now they were retrieving shards of pottery from someone 's cellar . " We can date ce  --  ramics pretty well , " Mr. Rinsch said . " These are earthenwares and stone-wares from the time Europe started trading with China . The reason we call china ' china ' is that when that stuff first showed up , Europeans were eating out of flowerpots . Just like what helped start the Renaissance was some guy seeing people in silk and saying , Hey ! I 'm tired of burlap. ' "
