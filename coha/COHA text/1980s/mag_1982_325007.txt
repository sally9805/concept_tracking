Linda Ronstadt &; Co. put Pirates of Penzance on film <P> " Moviemaking is like working in a factory gluing fenders on cars . Three minutes and stop , three minutes and stop . I said I would n't do it if they paid me , so they did n't pay me and I did it . I have n't talked to anyone who was n't wearing a costume in a month and a half . " <P> - Linda Ronstadt <P> Linda , ever so slightly bored out of her mind , has gone stale in London toward the end of filming her first and maybe her last movie , Joseph Papp 's New York Shakespeare Festival production of Gilbert and Sullivan 's Pirates of Penzance . She knows it and she is sorry , because she loves Pirates , and Papp , and Director Wilfred Leach , and Cast Members Rex Smith ( the seraphically stupid hero Frederic ) , Kevin Kline ( the pirate king ) , George Rose ( the major general ) , Angela Lansbury ( the nursemaid Ruth ) and Tony Azito ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who joined the company for the movie , they have all been together since Papp had the idea a couple of years ago that Pirates might make a few weeks of fun in the summer of 1980 for Central Park 's outdoor theater . Their mutual loyalty is so strong that the five principals-Azito 's role is smaller-agreed to an almost unheard-of pay scheme by which each of them took an equal and relatively small salary so that Papp could afford to make the film ( hence Ronstadt 's remark about acting without being paid ) . Papp , for his part , is proud of keeping his congenial family together , and of fighting off Hollywood offers-for instance , to finance Pirates if he cast John Travolta as the pirate king instead of Kline . <P> All true , and true also that Ronstadt , 35 , was both enthusiastic and jealously protective of her stage role as Mabel , the prettiest and cleverest of the major general 's eight wonky daughters . " I would have died before I let my understudy take over onstage , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shine before an audience , but it was my part . " Now she is preserving it against the fender-gluing tedium of film making , with its rhythm of endless delays . Between takes on the set , she hikes her white Victorian hobble skirt up to her knees so that she can sit down in it , finds her place in Henry James ' Portrait of a Lady , and until a hand appears between page and eyes-a makeup woman minutely improving Mabel 's face-she reads subtle paragraphs about Americans abroad . But it is now harder for her to find the intensity that the stage show always seemed to generate , and Director Leach has noticed that lately she seems to grit her teeth when thinking of England . Love scenes with Rex Smith are still to be shot , and she must be shyly radiant . Leach has told her to take some time off , fly back to her home in Los Angeles and soak up those shy , radiant freeway vitamins .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
