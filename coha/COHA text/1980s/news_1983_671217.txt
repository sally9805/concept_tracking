Good evening . I want to thank the networks for an opportunity to offer a different viewpoint . While there ' s no unanimity in Congress - on either side of the aisle - on Central America , tonight I ' m speaking for the many Americans who are concerned about our everdeepening involvement in the military conflict in that part of the world. // I ' m pleased to note that the President this evening was willing to recognize an economic and political dimension to the problems in Central America , including the possibility of negotiations. // Concerned members of Congress have been pressing this point ever since the President came to office . Regrettably , however , as his statement tonight demonstrates , the fundamental view continues to emphasize military problems and the search for military solutions . In the months and years that follow this evening , after the applause has faded and the ringing phrases are forgotten , Americans will have to live with the choices we make in this fateful time of decision. // In the past , we as a nation have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some would paint it . Charts and statistics can be used or misused to prove any side of a case . And speeches can sound very good without being very right. // So first of all , let me state clearly that on some very important things , all Americans stand in agreement . We will oppose the establishment of Marxist states in Central America . We will not accept to see the creation of Soviet military bases in Central America . And , we will not tolerate the placement of Soviet offensive missiles in Central America - or anywhere in this hemisphere . <> <> Ready to Fight // Finally , we are fully prepared to defend our security and the security of the Americas , if necessary , by military means . All patriotic Americans share these goals . But many of us in Congress , Democrats and Republicans , disagree with the President because we believe the means he has chosen will not fulfill them. // Those of us who oppose the President ' s policy believe that he is mistaken in critical ways . To begin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict in Central America . We can not afford to found so important a policy on ignorance - and the painful truth is that many of our highest officials seem to know as little about Central America in 1983 as we knew about Indochina in 1963. // I ' ve lived with the people in this region . Let me share some facts with you about Central America . <> <> Poverty and Deprivation // Most of the people there are appallingly poor . They can ' t afford to feed their families when they ' re hungry . They can ' t find a doctor for them when they ' re sick . They live in rural shacks with dirt floors or city slums without plumbing or clean water . The majority can ' t read or write ; and many of them can ' t even count. // It takes all five Spanish-speaking countries of Central America more than a year to provide what this nation does , or produce what this nation does , in less than three days . Virtually none of even that meager amount ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very few live in isolated splendor while the very many suffer in shantytown squalor . In country after country , dictatorship or military dominance has stifled democracy and destroyed human rights. // If Central America were not racked with poverty , there would be no revolution . If Central America were not racked with hunger , there would be no revolution . If Central America were not racked with injustice , there would be no revolution . In short , there would be nothing for the Soviets to exploit . But unless those oppressive conditions change , the region will continue to seethe with revolution - with or without the Soviets . <> <> ' A Dark Tunnel ' // Instead of trying to do something about the factions or factors which breed revolution , this Administration has turned to massive military buildups at a cost of hundreds of millions of dollars . Its policy is ever-increasing military assistance , endless military training , and further military involvement . This is a formula for failure . And it is a proven prescription for picking a loser . The American people know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it only leads to a dark tunnel of endless intervention. // Tonight the President himself told us that things were not going well in Central America . But for this the President can not blame Congress . We have given him what he has asked for . Seven hundred million in economic and military assistance has been delivered or is on its way to El Salvador since Ronald Reagan came to office , all at his request and all with Congressional approval . One of every five Salvadoran soldiers fighting for its government was trained right here in the United States . American soldiers are there now training Salvadoran army units which are employing modern weapons built in American factories. // Now the President asks for an even greater commitment . His requests for El Salvador alone will bring the total aid to that country during his term to more than $1 billion. // One billion dollars to counter a rebel army that , according to all reports , does not exceed 7 , 000 guerrillas. <> <> $140 , 000 for Each Guerrilla // That means you are paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those guerrillas we are trying to defeat . While your tax dollars have been pouring into El Salvador , the money skimmed off by that nation ' s very rich is leaving the country . For every dollar we ' ve sent in , more than a dollar has gone out - to numbered accounts in Zurich or to buy stocks on Wall Street . It raises the question of why we should invest in the future of El Salvador when the wealthiest citizens of that country are investing in Swiss banks. // What return have we received for all we have spent ? The army in El Salvador has been reluctant to fight - and is led by an officer corps working a nine-to-five shift with weekends off . Land reform has been abandoned . At least 30 , 000 civilians have been killed and the majority of them have been victims of the Government ' s own security forces . American nuns and labor advisors have been murdered - and the judicial system is so intimidated that it can not even bring accused murderers to trial. // For those 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been fewer than 200 convictions . <> <> ' Folly , Pure and Simple ' // American dollars alone can not buy military victory - that is the lesson of the painful past and of this newest conflict in Central America . If we continue down that road , if we continue to ally ourselves with repression , we will not only deny our own most basic values , we will also find ourselves once again on the losing side . It is folly , pure and simpe , to pursue a course which is wrong in principle - in order to wage a conflict which can not be won. // After 30 , 000 deaths , after hundreds of millions of dollars , with the ante going up , with no end in sight , with no hope for any change , real change , the time has come for a different approach . Yes , we are fully prepared to be involved in Central America . But the question is the nature and quality of our involvement . We must offer an alternative policy that can work. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States to achieve an immediate cessation of hostilities in both El Salvador and Nicaragua . Already in both countries too many people have died . It is time for the killing to stop. // Second , the United States should use all its power and influence to work for a negotiated political settlement in Central America . <> <> Offer to Negotiate // In El Salvador , the rebels have offered to negotiate unconditionally . Let us test their sincerity . We certainly have the leverage to move the Government to the bargaining table . On his recent trip to that very Catholic region , the Pope lent the moral force of his office to such a step . It is practical and realistic to expect , that if we support it , these talks can get underway . And every major ally of ours in the region - Mexico , Panama , Venezuela , and Colombia - is anxious for such a step to be taken and has offered , I might add , to make the arrangements. // Those same nations have volunteered to bring Nicaragua into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as we know from the present accounts , press accounts , this Administration is conducting a not-so-secret war inside that country. // No one in this Congress or this country is under the delusion that the Sandinista government is a model democracy or a force for stability . But the insurgents we have supported are the remnants of the old Somoza regime -a regime whose corruption , graft , torture , and despotism made it universally despised in Nicaragua . The Sandinistas may not be winners , but right now we are backing sure losers . We are doing for the Sandinista Marxists what they could not do for themselves . We are weakening the very groups inside Nicaragua which believe in a free and democratic society . And that is the sad irony of this Administration ' s policy. // Third , we must restore America ' s role as a source of hope and a force for progress in Central America . We must help governments only if they will help their own people . We must hear the cry for bread , and schools , work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We must make violent revolution preventable by making peaceful revolution possible . <> <> ' The Tide of History ' // Most important , this approach would permit the United States to move with the tide of history rather than stand against it . For us , the stakes are diplomatic , political , and strategic . But for the people of El Salvador , life itself is on the line . I have been to that country and I know about the morticians who travel the streets each morning to collect the bodies of those summarily dispatched the night before by Salvadoran security forces - gangland-style - the victim , a person on a bended knee , thumbs wired behind the their back , a bullet through the brain. // We recoil at such an image , for our association with criminals such as these is not America ' s tradition . In other , brighter days we have stood for the aspirations of all of the people who are part of the American . Two centuries ago , our nation raised the light of liberty before the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exampal and an inspiration . In this Capitol building , from which I speak tonight , men like Daniel Webster , Henry Clay , Abraham Lincoln once spoke of an America leading the world to progress and human rights - and people everywhere listened with hope to those words. // There is no greater or larger ideal than the one which was forged here in the early days of this Republic . That ideal of liberty is our greatest strength as a nation ; it is a powerful and peaceful weapon against tyranny of any kind anywhere in this hemiphere. // We can take the road of military escalation . But the real - what we really don ' t know - what the next step will be , where it will lead or how much it will cost. // This much , however , we do know . It will mean greater violence . It will mean greater bloodshed . It will mean greater hostilities . And , inevitably , the day will come when it will mean a regional conflict in Central America. // When that day comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Central America , when the cheering has stopped - we will know where the President ' s appeal for more American money and a deeper American commitment has taken us . Thank you , and good night. //
