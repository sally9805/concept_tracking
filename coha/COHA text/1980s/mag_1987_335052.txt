To the managers of two New York City nursing homes , Muriel Clark was a timid elderly woman whose son was determined to get her admitted , even if he had to fork over tens of thousands of dollars in " contributions " to do so . Little did they suspect that Clark , 81 , was a volunteer state investigator . Clark 's successful deception led to the arrests of three nursing-home officials for illegally soliciting donations in exchange for preferential treatment . <P> A feisty retired social worker who has remained active in social causes , Clark stepped into the spotlight last week . As State Deputy Attorney General Edward Kuriansky tells the tale , she agreed in 1984 to visit the homes , posing as a would-be patient and accompanied by a state investigator who played her son . Last week she said the job was not so tough . If so , sharpies beware : do not trust anyone over 80.
