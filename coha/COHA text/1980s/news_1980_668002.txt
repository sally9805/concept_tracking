The NBA is thinking about expanding again , and yes , the proposal will get stiff opposition from Red Auerbach of the Celtics . An expansion committee decided yesterday in New York to recommend to the National Basketball Assn . Board of Governors that Dallas be invited to become the 23d franchise for the 1980-81 season . Celtic owner Harry Mangurian was a member of the committee , whose proposal will be voted upon Feb. 2 , the day before the NBA All-Star game at Landover , Md . But Auerbach , the Celtics ' influential and volatile general manager , said yesterday that he doesn ' t think the NBA needs another expansion , if , for no other reason , than it will " dilute the product " . " We had the merger and it didn ' t do what it was supposed to do , " said Auerbach . " The salaries didn ' t go down , did they ? We got some money , but that didn ' t change anything . Instead of bringing in somebody new , I ' d @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . " The expansion committee selected Dallas , a franchise group headed by Norman Sonju , and said it was the only city ready for an NBA franchise at this time . The expansion formula would be similiar to other years . Dallas would be allowed to select one player off the roster of the present 22 clubs , and would be given the No. 11 spot in the upcoming draft . Each exisiting club would be allowed to protect seven players . There had been rumors that Dallas would come in demanding a No. 1 draft choice in order to make their franchise competitive immediately . Obviously , the committee had ideas of its own . Futhermore , the committee stressed that Dallas must meet some specific conditions if its application is to be approved , one of which is completion of a new arena , already under construction . " This doesn ' t mean that Dallas has been voted a franchise , " said Auerbach , who was waiting to confer with Manguarian late last night . " It is just a committee recommendation and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ll know more after I talk with Harry . " Expansion is no good . Look what happened to the National Hockey League . The product is so diluted you don ' t know who is playing , anymore . You want to see New York , Boston , Toronto , Montreal and Chicago . Who wants to see Edmonton ? " Auerbach says a more serious objection to expansion than " diluting " is that the addition of another franchise could alter the so-called voting block of the powerful " Old Guard , " currently a coalition of eastern clubs and their allies in Los Angeles and Chicago . A story in the New York Times last Sunday revealed an informal Dec. 7 meeting in New York attended by representatives of New York , New Jersey , Boston , Philadelphia , Chicago and Los Angeles clubs . The purpose was to discuss possible voting as a block on issues such as profit sharing on local and cable television , and gate receipts . With four new clubs in the last three years , all from the American Basketball Assn. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put three clubs in the league from the state of Texas ) Auerbach is not sure the voting balance as it now stands can be maintained . " It ' s the votes that count , " said Auerbach , " and right now , you need only six . If you vote in an additional team or two , that changes everything around . It is like pushing a school committee up from seven to nine members to get more votes . Naturally , the new members would be expected to vote with the people who supported them . " The cable television is a complicated issue involving a lot of clubs , not just on the east coast . Some cities have more television than others . I ' ve never been in favor of sharing gate receipts . The cost of doing business in each city is different . In some cities , the ballclub is the only game in town . Their advertisting is less , even the cost of opening the building . I ' ve never been in favor of shared gate receipts and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help Utah , where they ' ve lost a ton of money . Let ' s help Golden State . Not somebody outside . "
