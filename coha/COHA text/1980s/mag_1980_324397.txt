Fighting the Church <P> When the Vatican ordered Massachusetts Democrat Robert Drinan , a Jesuit priest , to withdraw from public office last May , 15 politicians lunged for his seat in Congress . By August , polls indicated that Barney Frank , 40 , a Harvard-educated former aide to Boston Mayor Kevin White and a popular state legislator for eight years , was the clear favorite . Frank had been endorsed by Drinan and Senator Edward Kennedy . Moreover , voters in the largely liberal district , which includes wealthy Boston suburbs and factory towns in central Massachusetts , liked the rumpled candidate 's advocacy of more public spending on mass transit , senior citizens ' programs , and housing for the poor . <P> But the district is also heavily Catholic . On the Sunday before last week 's primary , priests in the Boston-area Catholic churches read a pastoral letter from Humberto Cardinal Medeiros . Proclaimed the archbishop : " Those who make abortion possible by law can not separate themselves from the guilt which accompanies this horrendous crime and deadly sin . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on abortion : first-term incumbent Congressman James Shannon , a Catholic , in the Fifth District , northwest of Boston , * and Frank , a Jew , in the Fourth District , who is a strong supporter of the ERA and equal rights for homosexuals , as well as public financing of abortions for poor women . His chief opponent , six-term Waltham Mayor Arthur Clark , a Catholic , had staunchly opposed abortions and had received heavy financial support from anti-abortion groups . Said Clark : " The church has the right to step in because there is an erosion of moral fiber in this country . " <P> But others in the Boston area were upset with Medeiros for having crossed the line between church and state . When Worcester 's Monsignor Leo Battista and 29 other Catholic clergymen asked Drinan to withdraw his endorsement of Frank , the priest refused . He warned the hierarchy that it risked damaging the church by involving itself in the race . Said he : " The authority of the church in parts of this district is dreadful . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a slim margin of 4,499 votes . More than half of his support came from the richer and less Catholic eastern end of the district . Said Frank : " I sometimes felt as though I was wrestling a tag team , with different people coming into the ring against me . " Winning the district 's Democratic nomination is usually tantamount to election . Moreover , Frank 's Republican opponent is little known : retired Army Dentist Richard Jones , 45 , a conservative from the town of Harvard , who opposes gun control and federal funding of abortions . But Frank intends to take no chances , and will run flat out . The conservatives ' tag game almost worked last week-and in one of the most liberal districts in the country . <P> Tucking Tail and Running Claude ( " Buddy " ) Leach 's political future looked bleak indeed after he narrowly won his congressional seat in Louisiana 's Fourth District two years ago . He was subsequently indicted for buying votes in both the primary and general elections . A total of 35 people have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leach 's home town of Leesville , but Leach was acquitted .
