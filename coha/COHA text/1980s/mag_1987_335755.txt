Chastened by a 1980 prison riot that left 33 convicts dead , New Mexico built a new maximum-security facility near Santa Fe with a surveillance system that was supposedly state of the art . But a snafu in the electric eyes plus a tight budget that cut out the nighttime roof guard allowed the Independence Day escape of two killers and five other felons . <P> The breakout was led by Convicted Murderer William Wayne Gilbert , 38 , who pulled a .22-cal. gun , shot a guard and released six other inmates from their cells . The seven fled to the roof , thence over an 18-ft. - high chain link fence . By Saturday , searchers had caught four fugitives , but Gilbert and two others remained free . Corrections Secretary O. Lane McCotter authorized pursuers to shoot to kill if necessary .
