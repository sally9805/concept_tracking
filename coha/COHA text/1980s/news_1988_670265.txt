NEW YORK  --  Merrill Lynch &; Co. is crafting a swashbuckling new securities product , designed to improve the often-mediocre returns on publicly traded bond funds . But the deal raises thorny tax questions , and some fund managers think Merrill is trying to hold up Wall Street with a squirt gun . Merrill Lynch Capital Markets plans to underwrite several large offerings of preferred stock , with the assets of the funds supporting the preferred issues . Merrill expects to file its first such offering with the Securities and Exchange Commission soon , perhaps this week . Meanwhile , it won ' t disclose details of the financing or which funds it has lined up to participate . But the deal may have something for everybody . The fund , for example , would rake in the difference between the short-term interest rates it would pay on the preferred and the higher , long-term rates it would earn on additional bonds purchased with the offering ' s proceeds . For underwriting and selling the preferred stock , Merrill would earn lucrative commissions , which have been hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Managers of the fund would benefit , because the fees they earn are pegged to the amount of their assets , which would increase . And even after payment of preferred dividends , shareholders of the bond fund would see their returns increase in the first year . For example , Merrill says , a $100 million bond fund might issue $50 million of floating-rate preferred stock , paying a dividend of about 7 1/2% . Preferred-stock buyers , typically corporations , accept such relatively low rates because 70% of the dividend income is exempt from tax . The $50 million proceeds then could be reinvested at a rate of around 10% , the current yield on an investment-grade debt security . The preferred offering would be hedged , just in case short-term rates rise to exceed long-term rates , as they did in the early 1980s . Equity funds might have difficulty issuing preferred , because Congress is considering reducing the tax exemption on dividends to 50% . Such legislation wouldn ' t affect bond funds issuing preferred , however . " It ' s a win-win " proposition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to earn higher , safer returns , " says Robert Baer , a Merrill managing director . He predicts that at least " half a dozen " bond funds will issue preferred stock this year . But Merrill ' s idea encounters plenty of skepticism . " I wouldn ' t get excited about it , " says John B. Neff , a Valley Forge , Pa. - based managing partner of Wellington Management Co . " The whole thing reeks of subterfuge . I wonder how the Internal Revenue Service looks at it . " He notes that one investment vehicle , the bond fund , appears to be taking advantage of the tax benefits of another , the preferred . John C. Bogle , chairman of the Vanguard Group of Investment Cos. , isn ' t much kinder to the Merrill plan . He doesn ' t see much chance to exploit a wide gap between short-term and long-term rates . " If they issue preferred , " he says , " I figure they ' ll pay 10% to get 10% . " W. David MacCallan , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has leveraged funds , agrees : " If I were the corporate buyer of the preferred , I ' d demand a huge yield premium . This wouldn ' t be General Electric preferred , you know . " Even if Merrill manages to sell preferred at a yield well below the rate at which it reinvests the sale ' s proceeds , hedging the risk of rising interest rates " isn ' t like rolling off a log , " Vanguard ' s Mr. Bogle says . " Using Treasury bond futures to hedge is astonishingly imprecise . " Mr. Baer of Merrill insists the firm wouldn ' t underwrite and sell such a novel offering unless " we could achieve all our goals . " Moreover , he says , any issue Merrill underwrites will be accompanied by a legal opinion or pending ruling from the IRS . Closed-end bond funds certainly don ' t lack an incentive to spruce up their otherwise lackluster performance . Of the $10 billion underwritten this year , " almost without exception , they all are down from their initial public offering prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inc . " The problem with all these ( funds ) is they were sold on a yield basis , " Mr. Lipper adds . " The customer doesn ' t realize there ' s a capital risk . " That risk came sharply into focus , as the yield on 30-year government bonds rose as much as a percentage point between February and May , sending prices into a deep slump . Mr. Lipper worries about another risk , as well . " The last time we saw lots of leveraged closed-end funds was in the 1920s , " he says . " Very few of them made it to the 1930s . " Merrill ' s Mr. Baer says a comparison with the rampant speculation of the 1920s is inappropriate , " because we now have an SEC . " Nevertheless , he concedes : " If in the normal course of managing money , a fund manager isn ' t performing and tries to use new money to bring his fund up to standards , there ' s the potential for abuse . It happened before . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of The Wall Street Journal
