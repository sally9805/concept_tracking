Paragraphs from the National edition have been added to this story . Three politically connected Chicago law firms were hired Friday as the new general counsel to McCormick Place , and officials said " one or two " minority-owned firms soon will be added to the already crowded legal team . Friday ' s hirings brought to five the number of law firms working for the convention center , where annual payments to outside lawyers have soared to seven figures since construction foul-ups began on the new annex hall . Because the six-member Metropolitan Fair &; Exposition Authority Board is appointed half by Gov . James Thompson and half by Mayor Harold Washington , the choice was viewed by insiders as a test of each man ' s ability to deliver " pinstripe patronage " to their respective camps . LaSalle Street sources said the board ' s search touched off a political scramble among 19 of the city ' s largest firms , several of which joined with smaller minority-owned firms to enhance their bids . As it turned out , Thompson appears to have gained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one or two " minority firms are added at a later date . The winning legal troika , which will likely split more than $1 million in annual fees , consists of :  --  Sidley &; Austin , the 500-lawyer giant that counts many politically active lawyers on its roster , the most influential being Samuel Skinner , chairman of the Regional Transportation Authority and longtime political operative for Thompson.  --  Jenner &; Block , another legal powerhouse connected to Thompson , in this case through partner John Simon , who holds several other state legal jobs and whose wife runs the state ' s tourism program.  --  Vedder Price Kaufman &; Kammholz , a mid-sized firm with strong labor law credentials and ties to Washington . Vedder partner E. Wayne Robinson , a former deputy corporation counsel , was recently appointed by the mayor to chair the Chicago Plan Commission . McCormick Place board member Charles Tribbett III , a mayoral appointee who helped choose the firms , denied politics played any role in the selection process . Tribbett also said the convention center ' s legal bills will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McCormick Place board recently hired its own staff of in-house lawyers to handle work that previously had gone outside . And he added that the three-year-old annex construction project , which has seen legal bills soar from early estimates of $1 million to well over $2 million , is nearly complete . Anthony Mandolini , the Thompson appointee who helped Tribbett , said the three-month selection process employed " a long and intensive analysis . " Board Chairman James Brice called the choices " three outstanding firms that will serve the authority quite well . " Two other law firms  --  Earl Neal &; Associates and Concannon Dillon &; Morton  --  are currently defending the board against a lawsuit filed by an electrical contractor who quit the annex project last March claiming it was hopelessly mismanaged . At its meeting Friday , the board approved a monthly payment of $135 , 000 to those two firms . The search for a new general counsel began late last spring when it was announced that Reuben &; Proctor , which had held the job , was to be merged with the larger Isham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the managing partner of the Isham firm is former Gov . Richard Ogilvie , who last year was named trustee in charge of completing the troubled annex project . State laws forbid public officials from retaining their own law firms . It was uncertain which minority-owned firms will fill out the team . One politically potent bid comes from Davis Barnhill &; Galland , the firm Judson Miner left to become the Washington administration ' s top lawyer and which was recently hired by the Washington-controlled Chicago Park District . Another clout-heavy black law firm still in the running is Jones , Ware &; Grenard , which boasts former Deputy Police Supt. Mitchell Ware.
