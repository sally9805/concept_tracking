NEW YORK  --  Americus trusts are finally catching on among investors , though the bull market ' s surge and certain American Stock Exchange regulations are impeding plans to set up trusts for several stocks . Since 1983 , Americus Shareowner Service Corp. has sponsored 29 trusts . These take in from investors blue-chip stocks such as Ford Motor Co. or Coca-Cola Co. , in return for trust units that can be divided into parts embracing the dividend-yielding and price appreciation elements of common stocks . The dividend-related parts are known as Primes , while the price appreciation parts are known as Scores . By selling the Scores and holding the Primes , income-oriented investors can drive down their cost of a given stream of dividend income  --  in effect raising their yield . Conversely , speculators can elect to sell the Primes and reinvest their proceeds in more of the Scores and in the process assemble a position of what amounts to highly leveraged five-year options on the common stock . Until recent months , Wall Street took little interest in Americus trusts . But combined average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 221 units in September from 244 , 760 in July , says the Amex , where the issues are traded . In the third quarter , four of the Amex ' s top 10 percentage gainers were Americus issues . Some $12 billion of shares have been exchanged for Americus Trust units , says Emmett J. Harty , a vice president at underwriter Alex . Brown &; Sons who heads the firm ' s Americus Trust department . Although most of those units haven ' t been separated into Primes and Scores yet , Wall Street assumes they will be , adding significantly to trading volume . But a few trusts are moribund , including the one for Philip Morris Cos . It hasn ' t been able to accept any stock since Aug. 21 because Philip Morris ' s shares have climbed so much the trust ' s exchange terms are unattractive to investors . The trust gives Prime holders the right to all dividends over the five-year trust life , plus as much as $110 ( per Prime ) in Philip Morris stock when the trust expires in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond $110 at expiration . Trouble is , since Aug. 21 , Philip Morris common has been trading above $110 a share . Because of tax implications , that prevents any acceptance of stock under the trust ' s terms . Philip Morris common closed yesterday at $113. 25 , down $1 , in New York Stock Exchange composite trading . Furthermore , the Philip Morris trust units have been trading on the Amex on a when-issued basis . Under Amex rules , that must change to regular trading within a 90-day period , or by Oct. 27 . However , Amex rules also provide that a security can ' t be listed for regular trading unless there are at least 800 holders , each with at least 100 units or shares . As of yesterday there were only 465 such roundlot holders and the Amex has said that if the 800-shareholder quota isn ' t met by Oct. 27 , it will cancel all when-issued trades , which date back to July 29 . On Wednesday , Alex . Brown said the Amex has threatened the same action unless 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Oct. 27 and the one for Johnson &; Johnson shares by Nov. 13 . As of yesterday , there were 251 round-lot holders of Xerox trust units and 365 for the Johnson &; Johnson trust . In when-issued trading , neither money nor securities change hands . Under the threatened Amex action , traders in the Primes and Scores since the when-issued trading began would simply have those trades erased from their accounts , and any funds earmarked to pay for these trades would be turned back to the customer . While the cancellation might delight traders showing paper losses , those with paper gains doubtless would be unhappy . Yesterday , Alex . Brown moved to avert the threatened Amex actions by sweetening by more than $500 , 000 commissions for securities firms that are soliciting tenders into Americus trusts . In a letter to the approximately 30 firms involved in the solicitation , Alex . Brown promised to pay the soliciting broker $2 a share for as many as 200 shares for each round lot holder the broker persuades to tender into the three trusts until each has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the total number of round lot holders still needed to reach that quota in all three trusts , the additional incentive will cost Alex . Brown $534 , 000 . Mr. Harty said that the letter went to the about 30 securities firms currently soliciting Americus tenders , but that the offer would be extended to any other dealers on a first-come , first-served basis . " We ' re hoping this will settle the uncertainty about these three trusts once and for all , " Mr. Harty said . However , he conceded that even if 800 holders are rounded up in the Philip Morris trust , it won ' t become effective unless Philip Morris ' s stock price trades below $110 for one full day some time before the Philip Morris trust share deposit deadline of June 14 , 1988 . Otherwise , Americus trusts have been picking up support . Last week both the 7. 5 million-share Americus Trust for GTE Corp. and the 10 million-share trust for International Business Machines Corp. filled up , says Alex Brown ' s Mr. Harty . He adds that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1 , 028 , 000 shares by one of Wall Street ' s largest securities firms . Meanwhile , First Boston Corp. ' s warrant sales and trading group recommended the Americus concept in July and followed up with specific Score investment strategies in August , says Nancy A. Zweng , the vice president in charge of the unit . Merrill Lynch &; Co. researchers in August circulated a 10-page internal report devoted to imparting to Merrill staffers a " basic knowledge concerning the ( Americus ) trusts ' characteristics and concepts . " Among big investment institutions , Bankers Trust Co. says it has invested some trust accounts in Americus units . Alex . Brown ' s Mr. Harty says a major Swiss bank told him it plans to tender into all 21 trusts currently accepting shares . During the bull market , traders typically have paid a premium for the speculative Scores , which trade somewhat like warrants or call options . Thus , the Prime and Score together usually sell at a premium to the common stock  --  an arbitrage opportunity that has interested professional traders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater for trusts that have closed . Presumably , this reflects a scarcity factor.  --  - Table Americus Issues Rise to Premiums Priceas as of Sept. 30 P/S Common Premium Americus Trust For : Prime Score Combined Stock Discount American Express $25. 250 $11. 500 $36. 750 $35. 875 $+0. 875 AT &; 21. 750 12. 625 34. 375 33. 750 +0. 625 Coca-Cola* 33. 375 19. 375 52. 750 48. 375 +4. 375 Du Pont 74. 500 43. 250 117. 750 119. 125 - 1. 375 Exxon* 29. 750 19. 250 49. 000 48. 625 +0. 375 Ford 63. 500 37. 250 100. 750 98. 000 +2. 750 GTE* 32. 875 10. 500 43. 375 41. 500 +1. 875 IBM* 111. 250 42. 500 153. 750 150. 750 +3. 000 Merck 134. 500 81. 500 216. 000 206. 875 +9. 125 Mobil 35. 875 13. 875 49. 750 49. 125 +0. 625 *Trust closed <> Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
