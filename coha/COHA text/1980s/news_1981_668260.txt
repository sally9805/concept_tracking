For someone who has never made a commercial loan or accepted a deposit , John Comerford has made a fast move to the top of bank management . Just two years ago , Comerford left Washington , D.C. , where he served as executive director and acting president of the National Consumer Cooperative Bank , a quasi-government operation that provides financing and technical assistance to cooperatives . Later this month , the 33-year-old Dorchester native will become chief executive officer of the Bank of Massachusetts in Chelsea , the new name for the Old Stone Banking Co. , which has been sold to a backer of Comerford . " I ' m scared stiff , " Comerford admitted about taking control of the bank , which has assets of approximately $3.5 million and starting capital of $600,000 . " I ' m out looking very hard for someone who has made loans and matched assets and liabilities " to serve as president and chief operating officer of the bank , he said . But he qualifies as a chief executive officer of a bank , Comerford insists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not thefinancial business . " I think I know the banking industry from a policy perspective as well as anybody , " he said . Besides , he reasoned , " banking is not that hard a business . All you have to do is loan money out at a rate higher than you paid for it . " A graduate of the University of Massachusetts in Amherst with a degree in political science , Comerford worked for the city of Boston for six years in various capacities , including serving as the deputy director of economic development . He went to Washington in 1977 as an assistant to Secretary of Commerce Juanita Kreps and was deputy director of the White House Conference on National Growth and Economic Development . Later , he joined the National Consumer Cooperative Bank , but at the time decided he would leave within a year to return to Boston . Comerford ' s unusual background for a banker fits with the uncommon institution he will head . Founded in the early 20th century , the Chelsea bank was one of many " Morris Plan " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save and borrow for consumer needs . These banks do not have all of the powers of commercial banks , such as offering checking accounts and providing trust services . While most Morris Plan banks faded away , there were survivors in Chelsea and New Bedford . In 1976 , Carol S. Greenwald , former Massachusetts commissioner of banks , determined the Chelsea Morris Plan bank was in financial trouble and attempted to protect deposits of the uninsured institution by finding a purchaser . At the time she was looking for a savior , Greenwald was also dealing with Old Stone Bank of Providence , R.I. , as it sought her permission to merge with a New Bedford bank . Greenwald allowed Old Stone to take over the Morris Plan banks in New Bedford instead of the bank it was after if it also agreed to take over the Chelsea bank . Old Stone agreed , but the operation proved unprofitable , and last year the company began looking for a buyer . Comerford , having just returned to Boston , heard the bank might be sold and began looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy the bank from Old Stone involved getting capital from two community development corporations ( CDCs ) in East Boston and Charlestown and a labor union . The plan fell through , in large part because of the threat of cuts in the federal government money for the CDCs . Commerford was left with nothing more than several binders outlining his plan . In March , Comerford had given up the idea of acquiring the bank and was prepared to take a job with a New York investment banking company . He was stopped by a call from his lawyer who said that James Halperin , owner of a rare coin business with offices throughout New England , was interested in a private investment in the bank . Old Stone sold the bank ' s stock to Halperin . Comerford signed a contract to be chief executive officer of the institution . Comerford does not give the impression of being in the crowd of Boston ' s young financial wizards whose pleasure in putting together a deal is similar to the delight of an animal breeder at the arrival of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving on a very small scale , " he said about the acquistion of the bank . " We ' re talking about an institution that was going to be liquidated if we didn ' t take it over . " But a strain of political idealism is evident in Comerford ' s goal for the bank : " I basically want to show that you can be a community lender and development lender and be profitable , " he said . Beyond that , Comerford adds , " I want to run a business that is profitable . I ' ve been in the public sector almost all my life . You lack a certain amount of credibility being in the public sector . " One person who has had business dealings with Comerford said about him that " he seems like one of those guys who has been lucky enough to have everything work out for him . I don ' t know him that well , but he strikes me as being very sincere . " But , he concluded , " I think he can be one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get what he wants . " Comerford acknowledges getting more business for the smallest bank in Suffolk County will require an extraodinary effort . " I ' ll be knocking on a lot of doors . " There is , he said , a need for the Bank of Massachusetts . " If you go out and visit the small businesses in Chelsea , East Boston , Charlestown and Revere , you ' ll find that nobody has ever dealt with them . That market has been overlooked totally and the same thing is true for the low- and moderate-income homeowners ( in those areas* . " For at least its opening few weeks , the Bank of Massachusetts will remain a banking company whose basic services will be commercial loans , passbook and NOW accounts , and various certificate accounts . Comerford has had a bill submitted to the Legislature that would give the bank the same powers as commercial banks , including authority to offer checking accounts and trust services in addition to expanded lending authority . Within two years , Comerford said , he hopes to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he concedes a growth rate of that size would be phenomenal . After he achieves his goals at the bank , Comerford said it is likely he will go back into politics . But for now , " this is something I feel I have to do . "
