Francis Smith - arms raised , black robes flowing - slowly crosses the floor in a triumphant step as a tape recorder plays the opening number from ' ' A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum . ' ' Although he resembles a Roman emperor calling his Senate to order , Frank Smith is actually a Latin teacher quieting 90 members of the school ' s Latin Club , here to plan their annual Roman banquet. // Ninety members of a high school Latin club ? That might not have been terribly striking at the turn of the century , when half of all high school students took Latin . But this is 1984 . Who takes Latin anymore ? // At Wayland High School , almost 200 students of the 890-member student body do . And according to principal Charles Goff , full credit for the school ' s enthusiasm for Latin and the classics goes to Mr. Smith - who , after winning the hearts of a school and a town , has just been named Massachusetts ' teacher of the year by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take courses ranging up to advanced Latin , where 62 of them study the words of Virgil and Horace , in the original . More than 150 others grapple with the literature in translation , or are introduced by one of the classics department ' s three teachers to ancient history , Renaissance literature , archaeology , and philosophy. // ' ' He is a model of teaching , ' ' says Dr. Goff , explaining that this man he nominated for the annual award has mastered what he considers three essential qualities of a remarkable teacher : consistency , thorough knowledge of subject matter , and dedication to students. // ' ' Frank is like the bright kid in the schoolhouse , who only needs you to give him the opportunity to move ahead , ' ' Goff adds . ' ' I feel my job is to keep out of his way. ' ' // In fact , when Smith has teaching on his mind , just about anyone would do well to steer clear of his path . His colleagues describe him as a perpetual-motion machine ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Fond of ' ' dressing up ' ' to bring students and classic figures closer together , Smith one day becomes a merchant of Pompeii , another day Milton , presenting ' ' Paradise Lost . ' ' Next week he will mount a scaffold in the lecture hall as Michelangelo , telling the story of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. // ' ' Teaching keeps me busy as a beaver , ' ' Smith says , employing an expression now equated with his name at this suburban Boston high school he first entered 24 years ago as a student teacher . Viewing him in operation makes it difficult to see him as part of a profession that these days is often characterized as downtrodden , demoralized , unattractive , and failing. // In the classroom , his arms and eyes , in addition to his words , become tools for drawing response from the rows of students whose eyes dart from teacher to sheets of homework and back again. // ' ' Clinton , ' ' Smith says , dropping to one knee at the second-year Latin student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preposition with a dative evasion ? ' ' // Four other 13- and 14-year-olds chalk one-sentence translations onto the blackboard as Smith , once again on his feet , fires away . ' ' Laurie , how do I form the future paraphrastic ? ' ' // Later that morning , a smaller group of 16- and 17-year-olds is working through Book II of the Aeneid . Today ' s passage , including Cassandra ' s warnings about the Trojan horse , provides liberal opportunity for Smith ' s theatrics . Enacting the class ' s translation of Virgil ' s image of the night - ' ' a great dark shadow coming out of the sea and swallowing the city of Troy ' ' - Smith himself becomes the night : his black-draped arms extending before him , then the fingers of his hands spreading to accentuate the night ' s penetration. // For Smith , learning Latin is much more than a back door to good English grammar . ' ' It ' s not just the first declension , although that ' s important . It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that unlocks the grandeur of classical antiquity. ' ' // And why should that matter to us ? ' ' The classics can teach us so much about what it is to be human - about universal justice , and grandeur , and beauty . ' ' Pausing , then summing up his point , Smith says , ' ' It ' s so important to show students the excellence of human achievement . Somehow it makes them better people. ' ' // National figures show the study of Latin and Greek losing the tenuous ground they hold at the nation ' s colleges . The National Endowment for the Humanities recently issued a report concluding that most college students graduate without even a cursory introduction to classical literature. // But the study of Latin is actually rising slowly in the nation ' s high schools - and the town of Wayland is part of that increase . This year more than 100 of the junior high ' s 475 students are taking Latin . Students say parents encourage them to start Latin early so they can take advantage of Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his annual summer outings to Italy , when he introduces students and adults to the glories of ancient Rome . ' ' It ' s during those trips that you see how much he knows about those times , and what a job he does of making you feel part of it all , ' ' says Goff , who has twice accompanied Smith . ' ' He ' s so enthusiastic , ' ' adds senior Glen Rosenbaum , who made last year ' s trip to Italy . ' ' He really loves teaching , and we feel it. ' ' // But according to Smith , his first love really isn ' t the teaching . ' ' I love these kids , they make the teaching what it is : a vocation , a calling . ' ' And they love him . As he chats about his profession , smiling faces pop in the door to set homework consultations , while knocks and waves come from outside the window next to his desk. // This established warmth includes a fatherly rapport : One student lightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grammatical bind she ' s in ; a boy with a vogue haircut beams as the teacher emphasizes praise for an exam paper by mussing the boy ' s hair. // Smith says he doesn ' t understand students or teachers who are bored with what they do . Yet he acknowledges the low state of his profession , recalling the cover of a national magazine showing a teacher sitting in the corner of a classroom , wearing a dunce cap . ' ' That hurts , ' ' he says . One of his fondest hopes , he says , is to use the exposure resulting from his award ' ' to get the idea across to teachers who may have fallen into discouragement that ours is a noble , a very wonderful cause. ' ' // Helene Mensh , who has taught classics at Wayland for six years , is one teacher who got that message . Formerly at a high school north of Boston , Ms. Mensh says attending plays presented by Smith ' s students set her heart on joining his department . ' ' I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the classics are revered , and where I could teach some pretty high-powered courses , ' ' she says , making last-minute preparations for an exam on lyric poetry. // And Bonnie Catto , who teaches Greek and Latin at Mount Holyoke College , recalls her days at Wayland High , when ' ' Frank Smith had a lot to do with my sticking with Latin . . . he made it come alive . ' ' A 1969 graduate of Wayland , Ms. Catto says she can now appreciate Smith ' s ability to broaden the appeal of the classics . ' ' Involving everyone is what a classical education should be about. ' ' // An impressive number of Wayland ' s seniors plan to continue with the classics . Glen Rosenbaum says he ' ll minor in the field in college . Latin Club president Elizabeth Carls is considering teaching the classics . Adds Catherine Garvey : ' ' I hope I ' ll find teachers like ( Smith ) in college . He draws it out of you , he makes you want to work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathers papers for his next class . ' ' Teaching these kids is like directing a symphony orchestra , ' ' he says , dropping the papers in order to gesture with his arms . ' ' You don ' t march to the riser and treat everyone alike : This one over here you treat as you would the player of a piccolo ; but that one over there you work like the player of the big bass drum. ' ' // And with that , Smith is on his way . Throwing on his black robe , it knocks over a fuzzy , brown beaver . A quick smile comes over him as he sets the stuffed animal , a gift from a student , back on its haunches . Attached to an elastic band around the beaver ' s neck is a hand-lettered sign : ' ' I work as hard as a Mr. Smith. ' ' // //
