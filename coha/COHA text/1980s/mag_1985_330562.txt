Shirley Merchant of Danvers , Mass. , was sight seeing at the Sacre-Coeur church in Paris when a friend warned her to watch her purse . Too late . The carefully zippered compartment inside her shoulder bag had been deftly picked . " It was all gone , " she says . " My cash , traveler 's checks , passport and every piece of identification I had . " <P> It is a perennial tourist nightmare , one that Karl Malden uses to sell traveler 's checks on TV . Now , with a record number of bargain-hunting Americans in Europe , purse snatching , currency rip-offs and sophisticated new scams in some cities are growing as fast as the influx of visitors . Thieves are operating in formerly safe sites such as Paris ' Latin Quarter and even idyllic Stratford-upon-Avon . Refunds for missing American Express Travelers Cheques have climbed by a significant margin . " The British do n't want to advertise , " says Dick Haegeley , chief of the Passport and Citizen 's Unit at the American embassy in London , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane : BEWARE OF PICKPOCKETS . " In Paris they are operating in overdrive . Reports of lost and stolen American passports are up as much as 20% compared with last year , and , while Paris ' Police Judiciaire has not released figures , it indicates that last year 's 44,725 reported picked pockets will be easily surpassed . <P> Most officials agree that street crime is being fueled by growing drug abuse in some locations , high unemployment in many countries and the tempting presence everywhere of foreign innocents , many on their first trips abroad . " You have to learn what 's going on in a city and how to behave there , " says Keith Harding , an American embassy staffer in Paris , " but tourists do n't do it . " <P> Gangs of Gypsy youngsters menace Paris Metro riders by picking them clean in seconds , and purse snatchers on mopeds plague the Champs-Elysees . Says Paris Police Judiciaire Commissioner Claude Bard : " Paris is as bad as Rome , if not worse . " Indeed , while scooter-riding bandits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Via Nazionale , the petty-crime rate has actually dropped slightly , owing to increased police vigilance . One golden * oldie that still works : thieves slightly puncture a rental car 's tire , and when a flat develops on the Autostrada del Sole , they pull alongside , offering to help change the tire . Before a victim can say grazie , his luggage is out of the trunk and speeding down the road . Bolder thieves on the outskirts of Seville , Spain , smash the car windows of cathedral-bound sightseers stopped at traffic lights and snatch purses in the resulting panic . London 's light- fingered sophisticates are so prevalent on Oxford Street , home of department stores , that Selfridges broadcasts reminders to watch out for them , and an American lawyer noted that he found a shocking $9,640 extra on his credit card . It turned out that an unscrupulous ticket broker in London had charged him 27 times for the same pair of Cats seats .                    @
