Half a millennium after his birth , the first Protestant is still a towering force <P> It was a back-room deal , little different from many others struck at the time , but it triggered an upheaval that altered irrevocably the history of the Western world . Albrecht of Brandenburg , a German nobleman who had previously acquired a dispensation from the Vatican to become a priest while underage and to head two dioceses at the same time , wanted yet another favor from the Pope : the powerful archbishop 's chair in Mainz . Pope Leo X , a profligate spender who needed money to build St. Peter 's Basilica , granted the appointment-for 24,000 gold pieces , roughly equal to the annual imperial revenues in Germany . It was worth it . Besides being a rich source of income , the Mainz post brought Albrecht a vote for the next Holy Roman Emperor , which could be sold to the highest bidder . <P> In return , Albrecht agreed to initiate the sale of indulgences in Mainz . Granted for good works , indulgences were papally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " built up by Christ and the saints ; the church taught that they would help pay the debt of " temporal punishment " due in purgatory for sins committed by either the penitent or any deceased person . The Pope received half the proceeds of the Mainz indulgence sale , while the other half went to repay the bankers who had lent the new archbishop the gold . <P> Enter Martin Luther , a 33-year-old priest and professor at Wittenberg University . Disgusted not only with the traffic in indulgences but with its doctrinal underpinnings , he forcefully protested to Albrecht-never expecting that his action would provoke a sweeping uprising against a corrupt church . Luther 's challenge culminated in the Protestant Reformation and the rending of Western Christendom , and made him a towering figure in European history . In this 500th anniversary year of his birth ( Nov. 10 , 1483 ) , the rebel of Wittenberg remains the subject of persistent study . It is said that more books have been written about him than anyone else in history , save his own master , Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anniversary serves as a reminder that his impact on modern life is profound , even for those who know little about the doctrinal feuds that brought him unsought fame . From the distance of half a millennium , the man who , as Historian Hans Hillerbrand of Southern Methodist University in Dallas says , brought Christianity from lofty theological dogma to a clearer and more personal belief is still able to stimulate more heated debate than all but a handful of historical figures . <P> Indeed , as the reformer who fractured Christianity , Luther has latterly become a key to reuniting it . With the approval of the Vatican , and with Americans taking the lead , Roman Catholic theologians are working with Lutherans and other Protestants to sift through the 16th century disputes and see whether the Protestant-Catholic split can some day be overcome . In a remarkable turnabout , Catholic scholars today express growing appreciation of Luther as a " father in the faith " and are willing to play down his excesses . According to a growing consensus , the great division need never have happened at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
