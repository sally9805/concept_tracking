 | The Joffrey Ballet can sure take a punch . A year ago economic blows almost knocked it out permanently . It canceled its New York season and put the company on hold for six months . So its current comeback has been as spectacular as Muhammad Ali 's ? and more successful . The Joffrey has returned to its City Center home in New York with the splashiest and most ambitious season in its history . And the way audiences have reacted , you 'd think you were at ringside . The Joffrey Ballet does n't sting like a bee but it floats like a butterfly . With sixteen new faces and faster , fancier footwork , it 's a better company than it ever was , enforcing the old saying that whatever does n't kill you makes you stronger . For high spirits , energy , daring and sheer brilliance , the Joffrey is unsurpassed . In classical ballets , especially those of the prolific resident choreographer , Gerald Arpino , the space above the stage is alive with IFO 's ? Identified Flying Objects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart is versatility . " I do n't want Joffrey dancers , " says the company 's founder and artistic director , Robert Joffrey , 49 . " I want Ashton , Arpino , Massine , Balanchine and Tharp dancers . " Coming back from the edge of disaster has not altered Joffrey 's philosophy of renovation and innovation . He has compiled a unique repertory by resurrecting such forgotten or neglected twentieth-century works as Kurt Jooss 's " The Green Table " or Leonide Massine 's " Parade " and by exploring new directions with choreographic experiments by Twyla Tharp and Margo Sappington . The dancers move through this Museum of Modern Dance as if Agnes de Mille 's " Rodeo " ( 1942 ) or Nijinsky 's " Afternoon of a Faun " ( 1912 ) had been custom tailored for their bodies . There used to be a degree of uncertainty among the dancers as they shifted from one stylistic extreme to another . No longer . This new company dances " Rodeo " better than it was danced originally . It even dances its newest revival , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York City Ballet did when it was created for that company in 1950 . With eleven premieres , the current season has challenged the dancers as never before . Says Joffrey , " We wanted everyone to know that we are back and that we have n't wasted our time . " Opening night featured the revived " Illuminations , " meticulously staged by John Taras , ballet master of the New York City Ballet ( which has given the work ? decor , costumes and all ? to Joffrey ) . It was danced with tremendous verve and feeling for the decadence of the period , especially by Gregory Huffman in the leading role of Arthur Rimbaud . Patricia Miller and Beatriz Rodriguez were outstanding as Sacred and Profane Love . To Benjamin Britten 's powerful score , Ashton recounts the hellish life of the French symbolist poet in theatrical , fragmented tableaux . Insatiably curious , surrounded on all sides by a hostile , clownish world , Rimbaud searches for himself on the battlefield where spiritual and physical desire meet and where nightmare and reality intersect . Nonsense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached its climax last week in a gala benefit program consisting of the almost forgotten Dada ballet " Relache " and " Postcards , " a new work by Joffrey himself , his first since the beautiful " Remembrances " in 1973 . In " Relache , " which means " No Performance Tonight " in French , the Joffrey has exhumed a corpse that seemed to have been permanently interred . After its 1924 Paris premiere , it was given eleven performances by the Ballets Suedois , which briefly rivaled Diaghilev 's Ballets Russes . The bizarre work was a carefree , careful exercise of Dadaist nonsense in which the surrealist painter Francis Picabia provided the sets , the costumes and the scenario , Erik @#  | Satie the music and Jean Bdrlin the choreography . Intrinsic to the work is " Entr'acte , " an early surrealist film , only eighteen minutes long , made by Rene Clair when he was 26 . In it , Man Ray and Marcel Duchamp play chess on a rooftop , Picabia pretends to shoot Borlin and , in the funeral scene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the procession and leads the mourners on the kind of wild chase Clair would later use in his immortal comedies . " Relache " was the first " happening , " the first multimedia event , and Satie 's unobtrusive " furniture music , " which he wrote for the film , became a model for film scores . Joffrey entrusted " Relache " to Moses Pendleton , a founder of Pilobolus , who had already revived it briefly for the Paris Opera Ballet . Everything from the original was available to Pendleton , except the choreography . He had Picabia 's scenario with such instructions as " Dance of the Wheelbarrow . The Man . The Woman . The Tail of the Dog ( mimed song ) . " " I followed the scenario , which said you could do anything you wanted , " says the 31-year-old Pendleton . " So I did . I tried to revive the spirit for contemporary audiences . " Penguins : The ballet begins outside the theater with the arrival in horse and buggy of the leading lady , Starr Danias . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a grand entrance and is seated in the audience ( escorted by Pendleton ) . The stage is backed by a huge wall of hubcap-size reflector lights , and when these go on , Danias moves up to the stage like a moth drawn to the flame . Leading man Huffman , in top hat and tails , arrives in a bicycle carriage pedaled by a fireman . More tophatted men in tails , who have been sitting in the audience , waddle like penguins onstage to become the least synchronized chorus line since time began . Among the curiosities is the fireman , who stands at one side , guarding his buckets of water and sand , and ends up as a child sitting on the floor , making mud pies . It all begins to look like mad vaudeville . The fun is in the all-out absurdity , the rapid-fire sight gags of Danias , the ultimate vamp , and Huffman , a magician , manhandling the chorus of patsies . At one point Danias decides to walk across stage on the chorus 's cupped , white-gloved hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mr. Universe competition and then , Pilobolus-like , form the letters of " Relache " with their sinewy bodies . In the wheelbarrow dance , Huffman trundles Danias around , toppling her over , taking off his trousers and ironing them with the wheelbarrow . Nonsensical ? Maybe for the ' 20s , but you ca n't help making sense out of it as pure satire , since it so effectively parodies sex appeal , the inanity of show business and dancing itself . Robert Joffrey 's own new ballet , " Postcards , " is easily the best new addition to the company repertory . Like " Relache , " it is set in the ' 20s , the girls looking like flappers , the boys in white knickers . And it also uses Satie 's music , especially his popular songs ( the composer made his living for a long time playing the piano in Montmartre bars ) . The pieces are mostly miniatures . For example , " The Medusa Trap , " which introduces the nineteen dancers , is a suite of seven movements lasting two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for brevity of wit . In a breathless succession of solos , pas de deux and ensembles , he demonstrates what a brilliant choreographer can do with classical body language . Denise Jackson 's solo to " Sylvie " is a study in privacy as she dreams of an ideal lover . In " Tendrement , " one of Satie 's lovely ballads , she finds her lover ( Ross Stretton ) and together they dance in closely woven intricacy , as if in their living room . To another touching song , " Je to veux , " Cynthia Anderson and Michael Bjerknes lose themselves in romantic abandon , dazzling the eye with ecstatic lifts . A corps of four boys and three girls provides " Postcards " with some connective tissue , interrupting the proceedings with comical capers , horsing around in style . In the finale , a lilting waltz , everyone reappears , filling the stage with careless rapture and the audience with nostalgia for a more innocent age . Next to " Postcards , " the best new addition to the repertory is " Random Dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a score by Jonathan Hancock that sounds like warmed-over Keith Jarrett . Mussman , too , has a fine gift for miniatures . In what might be a ballet studio ? some of the dancers wear leg warmers ? she invents a series of brief encounters that vary from the plaintive to the broadly humorous . Mussman has an easy comic gift and a sly sense of structure . These are not really " random " dances . There is dramatic momentum as they build in technical complexity ? and the Joffrey dancers rise joyfully to each challenge . Most of the Joffrey 's other premieres are in one way or another ritualistic . " Night , " by the avant-gardist Laura Dean , is geometric ritual in which the dancers rotate individually , while revolving collectively , for minutes on end as if they were part of a planetary system . Less pleasing are the rituals of Glen Tetley 's " Mythical Hunters , " Choo San Goh 's " Helena " and Arpino 's " Epode , " whose pyrotechnics do not illuminate confusion . Evangelical : The Joffrey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost did n't make it . The reason for suspending operation , according to Joffrey , was the drying up of grants . " There are fifteen major dance companies in New York alone competing for less and less money , " he points out . The National Endowment for the Arts delivered one of the most damaging blows by reducing the transportation subsidy . " We 're a touring company , " says Joffrey . " For the first ten years we never even played in Manhattan . We 've played in every state except Hawaii . " He regards his company as evangelical , spreading the gospel of dance to places where it 's the only chance people have to see professional ballet . " And it 's necessary to our company . It keeps us fresh . Every new city inspires us to do our best . " A matching grant of $250,000 from the endowment ( Joffrey had to raise $750,000 more to get it ) put them back in business . Joffrey cut the size of the company down from 48 to 39 dancers . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admits . ) Sixteen of the dancers are new and twelve of them came from the Joffrey II , the company 's subsidiary . ( Pressed to comment about Ron Reagan , the President-elect 's son who is a member , Joffrey says : " He perspires and works hard like everyone else . He 's a good boy and we ought to let him alone to develop as a dancer . " ) Joffrey credits the new dazzle of his company to the close brush with oblivion . " I think the dancers came to realize just how important the company is to them . In a way , maybe it was a good thing for all of us . But I would n't want to take that risk again .
