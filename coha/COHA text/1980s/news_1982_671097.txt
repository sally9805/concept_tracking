The man is John A. Cody , the construction industry ' s most powerful labor leader . The first event is a threatened strike by Mr. Cody on Thursday that could shut down all heavy construction in the city , including the building of public works and the foundations of highrise offices and apartment buildings. // The second , scheduled for July 12 , is the start of Mr. Cody ' s trial in Federal District Court in Uniondale , L.I. , on labor racketeering charges. // The two events will shed light on Mr. Cody ' s influence and will continue the controversy that has surrounded him and his union , Local 282 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. // The union holds a strategic position in an industry that has an estimated $2. 5 billion of work under way and employs more than 70 , 000 people in the city . The teamsters ' local represents about 4 , 000 drivers of construction delivery trucks in New York City and on Long Island . <> <> Grip on Construction Trucking // Every truck that moves on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Long Island is either driven by a member of Local 282 or has the local ' s clearance. // " If they went out on strike , they could really tie up the whole construction industry , " said James McNamara , the director of Mayor Koch ' s Office of Construction Industry Relations. // In describing the style of Mr. Cody , who is 61 years old , both opponents and supporters generally rely on the same characterizations - " tough and shrewd . " Mr. Cody , who comes from a rough background on the Lower East Side , dropped out of school when he was 15 , worked for $1 a day as a trucker ' s helper and was a longshoreman before joining the teamsters. // Now , as the union local ' s president , Mr. Cody , who makes a little over $67 , 000 a year , has two homes on Long Island and travels in a Cadillac supplied by the union. // It was largely under Mr. Cody ' s control in the last decade that the local became a dominant force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island . But during that time Mr. Cody and the union have also been the focus of investigations by Federal authorities into possible corruption and organized-crime activities. // Last January , Mr. Cody was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Brooklyn on charges of racketeering , extortion and tax evasion involving more than $160 , 000 in reputed payoffs . Federal authorities disclosed that an undercover informant was able surreptitiously to record conversations relating to the purported illegal payments made to Mr. Cody . According to prosecutors , the recordings will be used as evidence against Mr. Cody when the trial opens. // Mr. Cody has pleaded not guilty to the charges and is free on a personal recognizance bond of $50 , 000 . <> <> Gambino Association Cited // Another official of Local 282 , Harry Gross , a business agent , was indicted last year on separate extortion charges . A second business agent , Bruce Kay , who was described by Federal authorities as Mr. Cody ' s bodyguard , was slain gangland style in 1979 while under indictment on murder and loan-sharking charges. // Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiries into both Mr. Cody ' s activities and the union began in the early 1970 ' s , after Mr. Cody was observed with major organized-crime figures . Other law enforcement officials said that among these crime figures was the late Carlo Gambino. // Union dissidents , opposed to Mr. Cody ' s administration , said that more recently he had shown favoritism by not enforcing the contract for drivers employed by a company on Staten Island . The concern is run by the son of a man who has been identified by Federal authorities as a major figure in the Gambino crime organization . <> <> Cody ' Unjustly Picked ' // Mr. Cody has declined to be interviewed about the indictment , his purported associations with crime figures , the negotiations for a new collective-bargaining agreement or his warnings about a strike. // Stephen P. Scaring , Mr. Cody ' s lawyer , said Mr. Cody had been " unjustly picked as a target " by Federal law enforcement agencies . " We look forward at this trial to finally put these accusations to rest , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are trumped up to be. " // In a series of articles in The New York Times in April , contractors and law enforcement officials cited Local 282 ' s ability to paralyze construction and show favoritism to contractors as examples of the widespread problems of corruption in the construction industry . Governor Carey , citing the articles , has asked the State Commission of Investigation to conduct public hearings on corruption and racketeering in the building trades. // Industry sources say Mr. Cody ' s talk about a strike goes beyond normal relations between labor and management . The union is seeking increases in wages and benefits . But the real purpose of the threatened strike , say those in the industry who have met with Mr. Cody , is to punish a group of contractors who have fought Mr. Cody ' s plan to put hundreds of teamster guards to work on construction sites . <> <> Dispute With Contractors // Mr. Cody raised the threat of a strike in April at a private meeting with members of the General Contractors Association , which represents the builders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major public works . According to several contractors who were present , Mr. Cody opened negotiations by telling the contractors that they would " rue the day " they decided to oppose him on the guard issue. // Mr. Cody has been fighting with the association for two years . He insists that guards are needed to protect workers from groups of minority protesters seeking jobs who sometimes demonstrate at construction sites . The contractors , contending Mr. Cody ' s proposal amounted to featherbedding and was a civil rights violation , won an order from a Federal judge saying they did not have to hire the guards. // Transactions Under a Cloud // In the indictment , Mr. Cody is accused of being involved in " a pattern of racketeering " dating to 1968 . The principal charges involve the acquistion and the later proposed sale of the Hampton Country Club in Riverhead , L.I. , by Local 282 ' s Pension Trust Fund . Mr. Cody has been a trustee or the administrator of the fund since 1970 , when the fund bought the club as an investment. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 in kickbacks from brokerage fees for the purchase of the club and later attempted to extort $250 , 000 from the broker in the proposed sale of the club. // John G. Strong , a real estate broker , was instrumental in the purchase and attempted sale of the club . Federal officials said that Mr. Strong in the late 1970 ' s became an undercover informant for the Federal Bureau of Investigation in an attempt to gather evidence against Mr. Cody about purported kickbacks . <> <> A Concealed Recorder // The officials said Mr. Cody usually forced Mr. Strong to undress and to be searched for hidden tape recorders when they discussed business matters . Mr. Strong , however , carried a briefcase with a concealed tape recorder that allowed him to record some conversations. // In June 1970 , the pension fund bought the country club , its restaurant , an 18-hole golf course and adjacent woodland - a total of about 800 acres - for $3. 5 million . The brick , two-story clubhouse in Riverhead is near the Riverhead- Moriches Road and Wildwood Lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the inquiry said Mr. Cody received a $60 , 000 payoff in the transaction . The pension fund bought 779 additional acres adjoining the club in December 1974 for $3 million , with Mr. Strong serving as the main real estate broker . From this transaction , Mr. Cody is accused of having obtained an illegal $100 , 000 payment from Mr. Strong . <> <> A Broker Is Chosen // Federal authorities contend that Mr. Cody has dominated the seven other trustees who jointly administer the fund . From 1978 until early this year , Federal officials said , Mr. Cody urged the fund to sell the club and its 1 , 600 acres . The club appparently had not turned out to be a profitable investment. // The pension fund chose Mr. Strong as the broker for the proposed sale . Mr. Cody , according to the indictment , demanded a $250 , 000 kickback from Mr. Strong if he were able to sell the club . The club , which was offered for $15 million , has not been sold. // Mr. Strong , reached by telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t talk to you about it , " he said . Mr. Cody is also accused in the indictment of these charges : // - Extortion from construction companies of materials and labor for the building of a house owned by Mr. Cody at 131 Lee Avenue in Southampton , L.I. The house and additions were built by companies that had labor contracts with Local 282 . Mr. Cody ' s house , on a secluded three-acre site , is estimated by real estate brokers to be worth about $400 , 000 . Mr. Cody also owns a house , valued at about $100 , 000 , at 2128 Bitt Path in Seaford , L.I. // - Attempted extortion of $3 , 000 from Richard F. Gallagher , a concrete contractor from Setauket , L.I. , whose company helped construct the Southampton house . Mr. Gallagher has told Federal officials that Mr. Cody paid his company $4 , 000 for work on the house , but then demanded that $3 , 000 be returned to him . In an interview , Mr. Gallagher said that after he had refused the kickbacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that forced his company to dissolve in 1975. // - Evasion of income taxes by failing to report the $100 , 000 payment from Mr. Strong in 1974 after the adjoining property for the country club was purchased. // - Extortion of a rent-free , three-bedroom $1 , 000-a-month apartment from the builder of the North Shore Towers in Little Neck , Queens . The extortion , in exchange for labor peace , took place from 1978 to last January , the indictment said. // - Violation of Federal labor laws by forcing three construction companies - the Transit Mix Company , the Parsons &; Whittemore Corporation and the Carlin-Atlas Construction Company - to give " no show " jobs to Mr. Cody ' s chauffeurs from 1977 until last August. // Accusations of Favoritism // Mr. Puccio , the former Federal prosecutor , said in an interview that Mr. Cody and Local 282 " became a major priority " for the Justice Department ' s Organized Crime Strike Force in the Eastern District of the state after Mr. Puccio became head of the unit in 1977 . Mr. Puccio resigned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said surveillance of Mr. Cody began in the early 1970 ' s when he was seen with several suspected crime leaders , including Mr. Gambino. // Mr. Gambino , who died in 1976 , had been described by authorities as the most powerful crime leader in the country . An F.B.I. official said Mr. Gambino was a guest at the wedding of Mr. Cody ' s son , Michael , on March 24 , 1973 , in the Huntington Town House in Huntington , L.I. <> <> Contract Enforcement at Issue // More recently , according to union sources and city records , Local 282 failed to enforce the contract with drivers at a prosperous new concrete-supply company on Staten Island that has obtained lucrative subcontracts for work on city sewer projects. // The concern , the Scara Mix Company , is headed by Philip Castellano , who is the son of Paul C. Castellano . Federal and local law enforcement authorities have described Paul Castellano , a close relative of Mr. Gambino , as the head of the crime group that Mr. Gambino once led. // Ted Katsoras , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s administration , said Local 282 , which normally seeks union jurisdiction at all concrete plants , was showing favoritism to Scara Mix by not enforcing the union contract . Many of Local 282 ' s members are drivers of concrete-mixer trucks. // Mr. Cody and other officials of Local 282 failed to respond to telephone and written requests to comment about the Scara Mix Company. // Incorporation records filed with the state show that last year Scara Mix took over a plant at 2537 Richmond Terrace that had been previously operated by the Scaramella Concrete Company . Local 282 had organized the drivers of the Scaramella Company . Scara Mix kept most of the Scaramella drivers , members of Local 282 , but it is not paying them the full union benefits . Mr. Katsoras said the drivers were afraid they would lose their jobs if they protested . <> <> Lucrative Subcontracts // Scara Mix was incorporated in December 1980 . According to records in the city ' s Department of Environmental Protection , Scara Mix - although new to the concrete business - has obtained about $1. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Island , about half of all such work in the last year . Scara Mix did not bid directly for the subcontracts with the city , but obtained them through private negotiations with general contractors who had won the contracts in public bidding. // Philip Castellano , the president of Scara Mix , said his company paid wages similar to the union scale of $10. 47 an hour . But , he added , his company did not match the $5. 61 an hour in fringe benefits called for in the union contract. // Mr. Castellano declined to provide any other information about the company . <> ' Wagon Boy ' to Labor Leader // Mr. Cody ' s official union biography says he was reared in a family of nine children and was forced to quit school at the age of 15 because of hard economic times . In 1936 , he began working as a " wagon boy " or a trucker ' s helper for $1 a day. // The biography , published last year in a union newspaper , said he also worked as a longshoreman and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relate Mr. Cody ' s activities from 1938 to 1947. // During those years , state court records show , Mr. Cody was mainly in reform school or state prison . At the age of 17 , he was arrested on charges of assault , robbery and possession of a gun . He received a suspended sentence . A year later , he was convicted of burglary and sentenced to three years at a reform school. // In January 1943 , shortly after being discharged from reform school , he was convicted of burglary and sentenced to two to four years in a state prison . He was paroled in November 1944 , arrested again the next year as a parole violator and ordered to serve the remainder of the four-year prison term . <> <> Charges Ridiculed // In January 1947 , Mr. Cody was released from prison . He soon became a truck driver and joined Local 282 . Since 1952 , he has held various posts in the union and has been president for the last six years. // Through statements in union newspapers , campaign literature and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has ridiculed the corruption charges brought against him by opponents . He has been reelected twice as president of the local , most recently last November. // " He is a tough guy and he has gotten his men good contracts , better than most other teamster locals , " says Nicholas M. Kisburg , a former teamster official. // Mr. Kisburg , who was the legislative director , or lobbyist , for all teamster locals in the metropolitan area , added , " He gets the best contracts , enforces them and that ' s all the men want to know. " // A driver of a concrete-mixer truck for the Transit Mix Company in Manhattan summed up the views of many members of Local 282 : " He ' s the only guy we know . He ' s got the experience and knows how to be tough enough to get us work and a good contract . " <> <> Concession to Union // The influence Mr. Cody has with contractors and developers was evident in an incident two years ago . At that time , Samuel J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was planning to construct the first housing complex in Battery Park City and intended to use a type of concrete not delivered by members of Mr. Cody ' s local. // Mr. Cody objected to Mr. LeFrak ' s plans . Mr. LeFrak , in an interview , said the union leader warned him that deliveries of essential supplies to the construction site might be disrupted unless Mr. LeFrak switched to concrete transported by members of Local 282. // The warning worked : Mr. LeFrak changed his plans . The revisions resulted in more work for Local 282 drivers at an added cost to the builders of $10 million. // On May 5 , a group of labor leaders and contractors gathered at a Long Island restaurant to raise money for Mr. Cody ' s legal defense . The invitation to the benefit from the Friends of John Cody said in part : // " We feel that John has been singled out for this prosecutorial action because he has been an outspoken , dynamic labor leader always seeking to help the working man get a bigger and fairer share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a target for the establishment . Now he is paying the price for standing toe-to-toe with the vested interests. " //
