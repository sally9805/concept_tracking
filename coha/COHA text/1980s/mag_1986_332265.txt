France 's grandes ecoles , the elite graduate schools in which its political , business and professional leaders are trained , not only provide a ticket to the upper reaches of French life but also serve as a repository of the nation 's highest culture and learning . Imagine the shock , then , when France 's top business school , Ecole des Hautes Etudes Commerciales , decided to offer a management program next fall that will be taught in English . Reason : English has become the language of international business . <P> H.E.C. is not turning into an overseas branch of the Harvard Business School , however . The new classes will involve only 30 students of the school 's total enrollment of 900 . Despite these limitations , H.E.C. expects opposition from the French cultural establishment . Nonetheless , says H.E.C. Professor Benjamin Stora , " to be competitive in international business today is to use a language other than French . In France , you have to be brave to say that .
