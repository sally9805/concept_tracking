The Ground of Hope BY DR . HOWIRD 1HURMAN When our oldest daughter , Olive , was three years old , I took her to see the Atlantic Ocean for the first time . My friend stopped his car so that we could walk to the shoreline , where at close range we could see and experience the rhythmic ebb and flow of the waves . At one point , she was overtaken by the advancing tide which spilled over her feet , whereupon she cried , " Go back , ocean , leave the baby alone . " The waves took no notice of her . One of the most critical grounds of despair in modern man 's experience with the world external to him , as well as with the impersonal social order which provides a living context for his sense of self , is the acute sense of isolation . Deep within the racial memory there is a sense of recollection of a time when without acute self-consciousness , man and his environment were a part of the same zone of belonging , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trees , the animals  --  all of nature , including man , belonged to each other . Of such is the poetic insightof all creation accounts , of which the Book of Genesis is but one . The harmony was broken . Man became isolated . A new kind of wisdom emerged : the loneliness of separation , of being on one 's own and of being placed under the necessity to re-establish a sense of self , with all the responsibilities for one 's actions or deeds . The phrase from our tradition is that man became " naked , " feeling himself cut off from all the companionship in the " garden . " Fear closed in upon him like a garment . The harmony was broken . When I was a boy in my native state of Florida , my closest friend lived across the meadow from our house . One day when I came over for a visit , I ran around the side of the house to the backyard where we always played . Suddenly his father rapped on the window frame and beckoned me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . I entered the room where he was and he directed my attention to the backyard , where Jack 's baby sister was sitting in the sand playing with a rattlesnake about one and a half feet in length . She would pull him by the tail as he crawled away ; she would turn him over on his back . It was a game being played in a sensitive climate of gentle harmony . The father instructed me to stand guard on the opposite side of the house from where his son was standing to keep anyone from coming into the backyard and rupturing the harmony . For if the harmony were broken by fear or self-consciousness , there would be danger , violence or death . If the harmony were broken , each would be seen as a threat to the other . Of such is the idiom of all the myths having to do with the " fall of man . " The emergence of a sense of self is the birth of all responsibility for one 's actions . There is a collective sense of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community and the urgency for a sense of belonging . It is this sense of belonging , this sense of wholeness that is the ground of hope which keeps alive the urge to reject all alienations which would cause modern man to deny his sense of self . But we are surrounded by the widest possible range of contexts which in and of themselves deny the reality of our very presence . At least in the world of nature the context is so vast , so interrelated that the psyche does not demand personal recognition of our presence . We are aware that we are not aliens or intruders . Our bodies are nourished by materials of nature , our kinship is established in the ground of our very existence . There is registered in our bodies our oneness with all creatures . We are affected by the ebb and flow of the tides and the waxing and waning of the moon in its phases . We are children of nature with a kinship prior to self-consciousness as persons . Because we are children of nature , when we are faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within us knows that we are not alone on the planet . Long ago I was puzzled by the difference in my reaction to death at the " hands " of nature , as we are wont to say , from natural causes , in contrast with the way I felt in the presence of one who had been murdered . The former seemed somehow to be chaste , clean  --  though terrible  --  while the other seemed sordid , dirty , unclean . The reaction to the impersonal operation of the social order is of another kind . There is something indefensible and deadly in being ignored by the social order . One seems to be manipulated and laid waste . It is a strange freedom to be adrift in the world of men , without a sense of anchor anywhere . Always there is the need of mooring , the need for the firm grip on something that is rooted and will not give . The urge to be accountable to someone , to know that beyond the individual himself there is an answer that must be given , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be weighed in a balance held by another 's hand . The very spirit of a man tends to panic from the desolation of going nameless up and down the streets of other minds where no salutation greets and no friendly recognition makes secure . Always a way must be found for bringing into one 's solitary place the settled look from another 's face , for getting the quiet sanction of another 's grace to undergird the meaning of the self . To be ignored , to be passed over as of no account and of no meaning , is to be made into a faceless thing , not a man . It is better to be the complete victim of an anger unrestrained and a wrath which knows no bounds , to be torn asunder without mercy or battered to a pulp by angry violence , than to be passed over as if one were not . Here at least one is dealt with , encountered , vanquished or overwhelmed  --  but not ignored . The name marks the claim a man stakes against the world ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is his right whatever elsebetides . The name is a man 's watermark above which the tides can never rise . It is the thing he holds that keeps him in the way when every light has failed and every marker has been destroyed . It is the rallying point around which a man gathers all that he means by himself . It is his announcement to life that he is present and accounted for in all his parts . To be made anonymous and to give to it the acquiescence of the heart is to live without life , and for such a one , even death is no dying . The antidote to the desperation created by being cancelled out by the social order or even by the world of nature in its most frightening aspects is the timeless quality of hope which assures the individual that he is not alone , not isolated , but a vital part of life itself and can not be separated from it , perhaps not even in death . It is not an accident that one of the ancient definitions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the narrow strip of water connecting the lagoon with the sea . In my childhood the favorite picnic ground was down at the inlet which connected the Halifax River with the Atlantic Ocean . It was this narrow stretch of water that gave the river free and easy access to the ocean and the ocean free and easy access to the river . In a wider context of meaning , faith or hope in human life serves the same purpose . Of such is the basis for affirming the integrity of the self in the presence of all the shattering dualism of experience . One of the simplest forms that dualism takes is in the interpretation of the meaning of life . There is a sense in which we think of life as contrasted with death , of life as against death . Here we are in the presence of a quality of experience from which all meaning is derived . And yet there is another view of life always present : It is that life contains both life and death . To state it categorically  --  life as contrasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of such is a very crucial aspect of personality . The notion will not be downed that some vital part of me , some dimension or overtone of my unique reality is not touched by the Continued on page 47 experience of even the apparently exhausting demand of death . Some place in all binding religions of mankind remains for a recognition of what is variously recognized as immortality , life after death , eternal life . The core of such insistences is this elemental experience of personality . This may be a carryover of the perennial insight , notion , feeling or idea that life itself is alive . Life can not die  --  life feeds on itself . Thus the Book says , " Death , where is thy sting  --  Grave , where is thy victory . " For the things that are true in any religion or in any faith are found in that religion because they are true ; they are not true because they are found in the particular religion , creed , doctrine or dogma . It matters not what I may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspect , some part of me that is ever on the outside observing me as I am doing whatever it is that I am doing . A part of me is the observer of me writing these words  --  watching , always watching . There is no adequate name for this aspect of my personality . This is the ground of hope and it is inherent in the givenness of life itself . This insight has far-reaching significance in keeping clear the autonomy of the self in a quiet manner transcending all the vicissitudes of experience . Here we are faced with one of life 's most intriguing paradoxes . There is a sense in which I am cancelled out by the sharp experiences of the dualisms that surround all meanings . Always surrounded am I by the dualisms of experience . Meaning seems ever to be defined by contrasts , by contradictions  --  light versus darkness , life contrasted with death , right against wrong  --  on and on it flows inunending aspects of human experience . And yet there is ever a lingering overtone in the mind or spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never final nor ultimate . Just as something of me always remains intact when life has exhausted itself in seeming to cancel me out , I know that it is happening to me . I may be vanquished , but something of me remains . Hence the insight that life is against all dualisms . It is here that the ground of hope blossoms into the experience of faith . This gives a strange and wonderful courage to the human spirit even at such times as ours . The obvious and ancient landmarks for establishing identity seem to be eclipsed or hidden by various aspects of modern life . Many of the Long-established points of referral on the horizon of the common life are dimmed or obscured by forces of the times . The list is tempting to explore ; to name some of them must suffice for our context . ( 1 ) The exploration of the secrets of atomic energy , which seems to place within the conscious power of man the ability to threaten effectively the biological continuity of the human race and even life itself as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegration of the family as a communal unit . ( 3 ) The power of the formal religious institutions has ceased to be a valid point of referral for guidance to the meaning and the ends of life . ( 4 ) The state as a political continuum in which order and collective structure may give power , security and meaning to modern life . ( 5 ) The educational institutions as the training ground and the disciplining of the mind in order that relationships may be defined ... to state several of the major guides upon which the generations of mankind have depended both for structure and meaning . Man 's place in nature and in the midst of his fellows may give security and guidance to new generations and stability to the social contract . All of this is to say that a person must feel that he counts ; there has to be available to him something in the immediacy of his world upon which he can put the full force of his weight and not be thrown back upon himself . At long last there can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he amounts to ultimately . This is the meaning of love . There is a steady anxiety that sur-rounds man 's experi-ence of love . Some-times the radiance of love is so soft and gentle that the in-dividual sees himself with all harsh lines wiped away and all limitations blended with his strengths in so happy a combina-tion that strength seems to be everywhere and weakness is nowhere to be found . This is a part of the magic , the spell of love . Sometimes the radiance of love kindles old fires that have long since grown cold from the neglect of despair , or new fires are kindled by a hope born full-blown without beginning and without ending . Sometimes the radiance of love blesses a life with a vision of its possibilities never before dreamed of or sought , stimulating new endeavor and summoning all latent powers to energize the life at its inmost core . But there are other ways by which love works its perfect work . It may stab the spirit by calling forth a bitter , scathing self-judgment . The heights to which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the individual is stricken with an utter hopelessness and despair . It may throw in relief old and forgotten weaknesses to which one has made the adjust . ment of acceptance  --  but which now stir in their place to offer themselves as testimony of one 's unworthiness and to challenge the love with their embarrassing authenticity . Love has no awareness of merit or demerit ; it has no scale by which its portion may be weighed or measured . It does not seek to balance giving and receiving . Love loves ; this is its nature . But this does not mean that love is blind , naive or pretentious . It does mean that love holds its object securely in its grasp , calling all that it sees by its true name but surrounding all with a wisdom born of both its passion and its understanding . Here is no traffic in sentimentality , no catering to weakness or strength . Instead , there is robust vitality that quickens the roots of personality , creating an unfolding of the self that redefines , reshapes and makes all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality that an individual knows that what is happening to him can outlast all things without itself being dissipated or lost . Whence comes this power which seems to be the point of referral for all experience and the essence of all meaning ? No created thing , no single unit of life , can be the source of such fullness and completeness . For in the experience itself a man is caught and held by something so much more than he can ever think or be that there is but one word by which its meaning can be encompassed  --  God . This is the confirmation that is called forth from the ground of his being by that which includes him but is more than he is  --  at once the end all and be all of life . There must not be the mischievous confusion over labels  --  the word most congenial to my mind and spirit is God . I can sympathize with Meister Eckhart when exhausting all categories which exploded and crumbled at hisfeet  --  at such a moment of high mystical intensity he burst forth with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Nameless Nothing " or the " Godhead " where no categories can hold . As for me , the meaning summarizes itself : God is the Creator of life and the living substance , God bottoms all existence and His creation is the lung through which He breathes . I find quiet reassurance with Tennyson 's phrases :
