Or did it begin with the Freiluft Museum , where I saw old wooden Austrian houses ? Or in Romania , where I was struck by the stunning simplicity of the one-room wooden house where the great sculptor Brancusi was born ? // Surely ' ' Alex ' s Place ' ' began with a love of warmth , strength , shelter , and the objects that express these qualities . It was named for my assistant ' s son Alex , whose enthusiasm for the project and love of art were irresistible . And so the name commemorates that place in each of us where a love of art dwells. // // ' ' Alex ' s Place ' ' is about 9 feet tall , 10 feet wide , and 23 feet long . Although it could inhabit many places , it is site-specific , designed with a certain location in mind . It is at Snug Harbor , on Staten Island , New York , just across the water from the southern tip of Manhattan . It is part of an exhibition of outdoor sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Contemporary Art and the Organization of Independent Artists. // The problem and the joy of Snug Harbor are these : Its parklike grounds , its graciously faded , elegant , pale yellow brick buildings , are so beautiful that the sculptor is hard put to improve on these surroundings . The echoes of its past , when it was a home for retired sailors , reverberate still . Its site on the water plays host to passing boats and ships of every variety . How does one relate to such a site , comment upon it , wed one ' s work to it ? // Wood was , for me , a natural choice , relating to my smaller works and to the Connecticut barns , wooden boats , New Mexican vegas , and old Austrian houses I knew and loved . Wood also formed a link with nature and the outdoor site . At first I had planned to use 8-foot lengths of cedar , 4 inches by 4 inches wide , laminated to form planes. // But a ' ' trial run ' ' with a cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site 12-foot lengths of lumber would be necessary to achieve a size that was in harmony with the surroundings. // This question of relative size , or scale , is so important to sculptors . Claes Oldenburg has played with it in constructing baseball bats that are stories high . Red Grooms has us looking deep into cavernous spaces and at swayingly high buildings by using distortions to create a sense of ' ' looking up ' ' or ' ' looking down ' ' in his wonderful ' ' Ruckus Manhattan , ' ' a re-creation of New York City experiences. // We all know that looking at a model of a city is very different from being in the city , surrounded by it . When artists create installations that people can walk through or sculptures they can enter , they are in a different realm from when they look at a small object . The relationship between viewer and artwork changes. // It was this change of scale that was all-important for ' ' Alex ' s Place ' ' and for me as an artist experiencing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the work began , new worlds emerged . The world of lag-bolts and thread-chasers for putting new threads on large bolts with threads destroyed by hammer blows. // The world of engineering . How do you support and balance huge planes of wood ? How do you laminate and secure twenty 12-foot boards to create a smooth 6-foot-wide plane ? How do you account for the shrinking and expanding properties of wood ? // Then there was the world of weather . If it was raining , we couldn ' t work outside with power tools , and with deadlines fast approaching I became like a farmer scrutinizing the skies at day ' s end for signs of tomorrow ' s weather. // And , of course , there was the world of the artist and aesthetics . It turned out that the angle of intersection of the two major planes , so simple and effective when looking down at the small model I had made , would not do when the piece was enlarged . The angle of intersection of the two planes had to be changed , and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems were worked out. // When an artist embarks on a public work , all these various worlds come into play . If the artist can not welcome and embrace these worlds with enthusiasm and still keep an overriding sense of vision and momentum , the experience will not be a happy one . All of these experiences must become part of the creative process. // When the structure was complete , I had the sculptor ' s pleasure of working at the edges with a chain saw . The purpose was to take an abstract form and make it look concrete , like an object or thing rather than simply an abstract design . I hoped it would be simple enough to function as a sort of universal symbol or emblem and yet worked and weathered enough to remind the viewer of all sorts of objects : boats , shelters . It was important that one could sit beneath the intersecting planes , shielded from the elements. // The finished work has reminded people of boats and nautical things , and this has reinforced the sense of site . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great sense of sturdiness and solidity . The cedar exudes its own perfume . The surface continues to weather. // Each public sculpture leaves an artist with indelible memories . I remember riding down the cobblestone streets of Vienna in the open back of a pickup truck , hanging on to a just-completed 8-foot-high stainless steel monument to be installed in the courtyard of the Technical University. // As we rattled along in the truck , the stainless steel facets of the sculpture blazed with reflected patches of sunlight and bright blue sky . ' ' How funny , ' ' I thought , ' ' to be riding down these centuries-old streets with a stainless steel abstract sculpture in the back of a truck . ' ' It was pure joy. // And now I think of Snug Harbor - which I have come to love more than ever . I have worked there from dawn well into the inky blackness of night , seeing boats glide by , feeling sun-changes , and the changing look of trees and sky as dawn goes to dusk . I have also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that found in galleries and museums . I have seen my work in the company of that of my colleagues . . . each work different , each singing its own song. // //
