Okay , TV-news fans , get out your scorebooks . A new round of star wars is in full swing at the network news divisions . CBS , in desperate need of a female power hitter , last week grabbed one of the league 's best , Connie Chung , from NBC . She will fill a gap in the CBS lineup opened last month when Diane Sawyer left to join the burgeoning Murderers ' Row at ABC . Meanwhile , NBC , looking to compensate for Chung 's departure , found no superstars on the trading block but managed to land a solid .280 hitter , Mary Alice Williams , formerly of CNN . All three are expected to have high-profile starting berths by the summer . <P> Their salaries are mind-boggling . Chung , who was making $1 million at NBC , will reportedly get in the neighborhood of $1.5 million a year at CBS , roughly the same as what Sawyer is said to be getting from ABC for leaving her post at CBS 's top-rated magazine show , 60 Minutes . That puts both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million ) as the highest-paid women in TV news . Even Williams , coming from low-paying CNN , will ring up a respectable $500,000 or so annually at NBC . " We are watching a profound shift in the way networks function , " says Marvin Kalb , the former CBS and NBC correspondent who now teaches at Harvard . " It is similar to what is happening in professional baseball or basketball . Journalists are exchangeable commodities ; the highest bidder wins . " <P> Stratospheric salaries for TV-news anchors are nothing new , of course . But last week 's round of anchor shifts marked a new phase in the TV talent sweepstakes . In the past , high-visibility newscasters were wooed mainly for anchor spots on the morning and evening news shows . Now they are being groomed as prime-time stars . Shows are even being constructed around them , the way Hollywood studios in the ' 30s used to create vehicles for their contract stars . Chung has been promised the anchor job on a soon to be reconstituted version of West 57th , CBS 's low-rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a new prime-time news hour on ABC , scheduled to debut in August . Williams will be one of several co-anchors of a new NBC prime-time news offering , Yesterday , Today and Tomorrow , also planned for a summer premiere . <P> The moves reveal once again how thoroughly the network news divisions have bought into the Nielsen mind-set . Faced with shrinking audiences and rising costs , TV executives have discovered that news programming , which costs much less to produce than entertainment fare , can be a moneymaker in prime time . Yet once these shows enter the arena with Knots Landing and The Cosby Show , they must play by the same rules . <P> That means stars  --  and star salaries . Though high-priced talent raids have been attacked as a misguided extravagance at a time when network news budgets are being slashed , these new stars , for better or worse , usually justify their pay . Their presence can mean precious ratings points , and sometimes even the life or death of a show . Says Andrew Lack , executive producer of West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that go to people who can handle them . They are worth the fuss made over them . "
