Les Krantz sure knows how to dash a childhood dream . He is editor of The Jobs Rated Almanac ( World Almanac ; $14.95 ) , a new book ranking 250 professions by such criteria as salary , security , stress , outlook and work conditions . Krantz downgrades jobs that look best to kids , putting garbage collector ( No. 226 ) ahead of dancer ( 240 ) , football player ( 241 ) and cowboy ( 242 ) . Last on the list : migrant farm worker ( 250 ) . At No. 1 is a job that few children even know about : actuary . <P> Krantz insists that his findings are not that surprising . Actuaries , who set insurance premiums based on statistical risks , have secure , relatively stress- free jobs but are well paid ( average salary : $45,780 ) . But actors ( 220 ) spend most of their time auditioning for parts they do not get , while fire fighters ( 210 ) work impossibly long hours . President of the U.S. ?
