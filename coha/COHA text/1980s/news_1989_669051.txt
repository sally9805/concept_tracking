On his way to Chicago from Buenos Aires , Jose Cerullo says , he hacked his way through the jungles of Colombia with an Indian tribe , had a run-in with drug traffickers at the edge of the Andes Mountains and was robbed by professional bandits in Bolivia . These are the kinds of adventures that Cerullo , now 20 , used to dream about while growing up with his adoptive parents in Argentina . That was before a few scraps of information , gleaned from a worn-out birth certificate and a cousin ' s vague memory , sent him on a 5 , 000-mile trek in search of his biological mother . According to the birth certificate , Cerullo was born in Chicago on Feb. 23 , 1969 , at 5 : 30 p. m . A cousin seems to recall having heard that he was born somewhere on Chicago ' s North Side . When he was 15 days old , he was adopted through Catholic Charities by an Argentine couple living in Blue Island . They moved back to Argentina when the boy was 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plains north of Buenos Aires . Cerullo was 8 before he learned he had been adopted . One hot summer afternoon , just before nap time , his mother told him and his 6-year-old sister a story that , he says , became " taped in my mind . " " She told us about a boy and a girl who had been abandoned for a reason no one knew , " Cerullo said . " She said the children didn ' t have a place to stay , so they were adopted by a family who couldn ' t have children and who loved them very much . Then she told us we were those children . " I ran to my father and hugged him very hard and asked him if it was true . When he told me yes , ' I broke out crying . That day I decided to look for my mother . I had this one big question : Why did she leave me ? ' I ' d spend nights thinking about it . There was this big gap . " Cerullo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has traveled to find the answer . Every year , thousands of adopted children begin searches for their biological parents . The American Adoption Congress , which represents 141 groups that help adopted children and their biological parents find each other , estimates that some 25 , 000 adoptees , and a similar number of parents , initiate the search every year . " Whatever they find is giving them an answer to all of their questions , " said Barbara Gonyo , president of Truth Seekers , a local group that is a member of the congress . " These children are not looking to replace their adopted families . They ' re not going to trade them in . " But when they look in the mirror , they need to know , Who do I look like ? Where do my traits come from ? ' When you find the answer , you feel whole for the first time . There ' s no more mystery . " Two years ago , when Cerullo turned 18 , he decided it was time to find out about his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey to Chicago , he said , and began an arduous training regimen . He lifted weights and studied karate . " I knew that I would have to be strong to make the trip , " he said . Last November , he said , he got a job washing dishes in a Buenos Aires restaurant and began saving money for the trip . He spent three months poring over maps of Latin America and obtained a passport . Then , with $120 in his pocket and a canvas sack filled with clothes on his back , he set out for Chicago on April 18 . He rode buses , hitched rides and walked across Argentina , Bolivia , Peru , Ecuador and Colombia , as the stamps in his passport attest . Sometimes people let him stay the night in their homes , he said . Other times he was allowed to sleep in fire stations or jail cells . Cerullo kept a diary of his travels . There is the story of how , for three days , he hacked his way through the jungles of Colombia with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night the Indians roasted monkeys for food , Cerullo said , but he ate only fruit . When he reached the border of Panama in late May , he said , the country was still tense after the crisis sparked by disputed elections in April and brutal attacks on opposition leaders . President Bush had sharply condemned Panamanian strongman Manuel Noriega . Cerullo said border guards warned him that he would be putting his life at risk if he entered Panama in this climate . His overland trek thwarted , he called an aunt who lives on Chicago ' s Southwest Side , who agreed to send him air fare to fly to Chicago from Colombia , he said . Since arriving here June 3 , Cerullo said , he has been trying to locate his mother , without making any real progress . He has landed two part-time jobs and is taking English classes at Daley College . He is sending money to his parents in Argentina where the economy is being ravaged by runaway inflation . " This hasn ' t changed my relationship with my parents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I love them very much . But there is still a big gap . I have to find the answer . " Although most searches for biological parents eventually succeed , it can often be a long , painstaking process , said Joe Soll , the American Adoption Congress ' regional director for the New York area . " It ' s a question of how long someone is willing to stick to it , " said Soll , who has been searching for his own biological mother for six years . " You have to play detective and sometimes it ' s difficult . " It is a lot more difficult when , like Cerullo , you have limited English and you are searching in an unfamiliar country . Still , he is optimistic . " I ' ve always had good luck , " he said . " I feel my mother will be found . At least I hope so. "
