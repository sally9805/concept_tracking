It had been conceived as a joyous occasion , a chance to let U.S. pride soar . The six surviving original Mercury astronauts would be reunited at a gala Los Angeles dinner , and workers at the Kennedy Space Center would gather for a ceremony . At both events , speakers would celebrate the 25th anniversary of American manned space flight and chronicle the quarter-century of achievements since Alan Shepard 's historic suborbital flight on May 5 , 1961 . After Challenger 's seven crew members perished on Jan. 28 , plans for a more somber observance continued ; a reminder of past successes might restore NASA 's morale . <P> Then , on April 18 , a Titan 34D rocket blew up on launch at California 's Vandenberg Air Force Base while trying to lift a Big Bird photo reconnaissance satellite into orbit . And just two days before the anniversary ceremonies were held last week , yet another U.S. space failure occurred : the main engine of a $30 million Delta rocket carrying a $57.5 million weather satellite shut down just 71 seconds after lift-off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We like to feel we 're infallible , " Shuttle Astronaut Bob ) Crippen told the subdued workers at the cape . " We 're not . We proved that on Jan. 28 and underscored it this past Saturday . " <P> The U.S. had suffered three consecutive launch disasters , not counting the failure of a small Nike-Orion rocket on April 25 , disclosed by the Associated Press last week . That adds up to the worst string of failures since the early days of the space program . Democratic Senator Albert Gore of Tennessee saw more than bad luck at work . Said he : " There may be a quality-control problem at NASA . " Gore revealed that the space agency had slashed 70% of the personnel assigned to monitor the quality of its work between 1970 and 1985 . Still , the Titan failure , as well as a Titan explosion last August , were Air Force launches . <P> Whether the space accidents were merely coincidental or shared some human failing was not clear . A poorly designed joint in the shuttle 's boosters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Space Flight Center in Huntsville , Ala. , where the rockets were developed , to heed engineers ' warnings about the cold weather at launch time , presumably will be cited by a presidential commission as contributing to that catastrophe . The commission disclosed last week that just five days before the disaster , the Marshall managers had virtually dismissed the recurring flaws in the joint , deciding in an unsigned internal memo that " this problem is considered closed . " Three of the Marshall officials who pushed the fatal launch are leaving their posts . Stanley Reinartz , the shuttle manager , last month asked for reassignment ; George Hardy , deputy director of science and engineering , took early retirement at 55 ; Lawrence Mulloy , the booster manager , last week was shifted to another position at the center . <P> The suspect in the April 18 Titan failure is also a booster rocket . But a burn-through caused by faulty insulation seems the likeliest explanation . As for the Delta failure , two unexplained surges of high current in the main engine 's electrical circuits apparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This possibility had been detected in 1974 . Some corrections were made then , but not to the circuit that failed .
