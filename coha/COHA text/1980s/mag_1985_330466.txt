Some bosses think they can elicit brainstorms from their workers simply by plying them with coffee and doughnuts . But Bruce Katz , president of Rockport Co. , a shoe manufacturer in Marlboro , Mass. , thinks a little sun and wind surfing are a much better inducement . This summer he is spending a reported $15,000 a month to rent Plaisance , a 20-room chateau by the sea in Newport , R.I. , that he has dubbed Camp Rockport . In groups of a dozen , each of his 220 employees takes a car pool to the mansion for two days of sports and shoptalk with the boss . Rockport , a thriving maker of walking shoes ( estimated 1985 sales : $68 million ) , has been growing so fast that Katz feared he was falling out of touch with employees . Says Katz : " We 're trying to be a democratic company , one where people are just as important as the profits they make . " <P> Rockport campers begin their days at the ocean with morning calisthenics , followed by seminars on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the afternoon they can get a tan , swim or play croquet . The program has been so popular that Katz hopes next year to give employees three days at camp instead of two .
