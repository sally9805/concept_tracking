The long-haul campaign day ( Connecticut to Maryland to Louisiana to Washington , D.C. ) had been grueling . Everyone on Gary Hart 's chartered 727 was pooped , the candidate most of all . He was in a mood to relax , to be himself . Ambling through the press section , Hart settled into a seat , sipped a drink and spoke freely about his campaign . <P> Hart believes the news media have not given his candidacy an altogether fair shake . It was suggested to him that more spontaneous chats with journalists might make for a more sympathetic press . " I ca n't do that , " Hart said . " I ca n't approach you people because then you 'll think I 'm pandering , trying to co-opt you . " He seemed sincerely frustrated . " Sometimes I think I 'm living in two different worlds-what I do and what I read I do . " Why had the day 's news reports , he asked , not mentioned the remarkable size of the crowd the day before in Harrisburg ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Why is the press so willfully skeptical , so predisposed to declare Gary Hart a passing fancy ? <P> He wondered why there were not more stories in which his supporters explain their enthusiasm . One reason , he was told , is that many of his new adherents are vague on the subject of Hart : his " freshness " is often the only explanation offered . " But you ca n't expect people to be as articulate on the issues as you are , " he said . " People did n't know the details of Kennedy 's foreign policy or Ike 's farm policy . " <P> Reporters ' dogged questions about his marital separations and his age change , it seems , merely nettle him . What really burns him up , he said , are the press portrayals of his late mother . " They 're making her out to be some sort of religious nut , a kook . She was a normal , hardworking , Godfearing woman , and she gave us the best upbringing she could . " Nina Hart , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Nazarene . Some stories have depicted her as severe and neurasthenic and have dwelt on her habit of moving the family frequently . Hart noted emphatically that his family had been poor ; fixing up and reselling modest houses in their home town of Ottawa , Kans. , he insisted , was a way of making ends meet . " My parents , " he went on , " were mainly interested in loving us , in giving us the best start they could , in letting us be whatever we could be . " <P> Hart used to complain about reporters ' rote descriptions of him as " cool and aloof . " But amid the evening hush , as his 727 headed for Washington , he confessed that he is uneasy with street campaigning . He manages the jolly handshaking and baby kissing . But he is ambivalent , at least , about the surging excitement of the crowds , the yearning he sees in hundreds of anonymous faces every day . " Those people are obviously looking for somebody to believe in , someone they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is awesome , even frightening . No matter who the candidate , he says , the crowds are bound to be disappointed . " Sooner or later , they 'll be let down . "
