Patience has turned out to be a virtue for White Sox General Manager Larry Himes . At least in the trading department . Himes , criticized for not making any trades during the 1987 season , has been the one of the most active traders during the postseason . He feels if the Sox had made some of those trades in June , they wouldn ' t be where they are in February . By waiting to deal Floyd Bannister , Richard Dotson and Jose DeLeon , Himes got nine players in return , including top prospects Lance Johnson , Melido Perez and Dan Pasqua . " In June , everyone was crying for us to do something , " Himes said . " We didn ' t make any trades . We did the right thing . We waited to maximize our position . " Bannister was an excellent case in point . Struggling and under . 500 at the All-Star break , the left-hander was dangled for Oakland . The A ' s countered with a package that consisted of erratic pitcher Jose Rijo and minor-league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but none of the quality that interested Himes . Instead , he kept Bannister , who went on to have an excellent second half , then traded him in December to Kansas City for four top pitching prospects . " We couldn ' t have gotten four players for Bannister in July , " Himes said . " And we wouldn ' t have gotten that type of quality . " Himes conducted numerous trade talks , but he conceded he only came close once to making a deal . In May , he was set to peddle Dotson to Minnesota for Tom Brunansky . But the trade hit a snag when the Twins wouldn ' t include a minor-league pitching prospect . Himes held out and eventually sent Dotson to the Yankees in November for Pasqua , catcher Mark Salas and pitcher Steve Rosenberg . " I feel good with what we ' ve done , " Himes said . " You ' ve got to have patience and be objective in this department . I think we have done things with judgment and direction behind them . People understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining quiet on the Carlton Fisk front , but a decision is expected this week . Fisk still is considering a contract offer from Kansas City . He signed a one-year deal with the Sox in December , but an arbitrator ' s decision gave him the right to be a free agent until March 1 . The Royals , desperate for catching and right-handed hitting , would like to have an answer from Fisk before the end of the week , when pitchers and catchers report to spring training . The Royals ' offer is believed to be similar to the one-year , $700 , 000 deal Fisk signed with the Sox for 1988 . Kansas City GM John Schuerholz has said the Royals won ' t get in a bidding war with the Sox . He reportedly also won ' t give Fisk a multiyear deal . Privately , the Sox believe Fisk , who has strong ties to this area , will stay with the team . And the Royals aren ' t optimistic that he will take their offer. - Bobby Thigpen ' s agent , Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reinsdorf this week to work on the reliever ' s salary dispute . Thigpen , who recorded 16 saves last year , is upset with the club ' s offer of $70 , 000 . The Sox are willing to up the ante if he ' ll agree to give up his first year of arbitration . Thigpen isn ' t interested in such a deal . Among his options is a possible spring training holdout . Bronner wouldn ' t comment on that tactic except to say , " It ' s been our history not to hold our players out of camp . " Meanwhile , Thigpen continues to send Reinsdorf a daily poem expressing his displeasure . Reinsdorf has countered with a couple of replies in rhyme . The situation went national last week when the Wall Street Journal published a story on this financial poetic warfare. - A decision is expected Monday or Tuesday on Gary Redus ' arbitration case , which was heard Thursday . Redus , who made $400 , 000 last year , is seeking $460 , 000 . The Sox want to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bases last year but hit only . 236.
