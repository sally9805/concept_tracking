Camille had first met him at Mother Anthony 's Inn at Marlotte . He had absorbed something from every painter at the Guerbois ; then added something of his own ebullient spirit to his canvas . The critics of the i 866 and 1868 Salons had called his work " harmonious , decorative and timid . " In the fall a second miracle befell Camille . He acquired his first collector , independently of a gallery . Jean Baptiste Faure was one of the most popular singers of the Paris Opera , famous for his portrayal of Hamlet , a handsome bravura type of man who looked well flourishing a sword . He had been attracted by Camille 's The Hermitage , A Landscape in the Salon and asked Edouard Manet to introduce him . They met at the Guerbois . " I 'm honored to meet you , " Faure said in his rich baritone voice . " I 'd like to acquire one of your Pontoise paintings . The one I saw moved me deeply . " Camille took him to Guillemet 's studio . Faure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaks to me , " he said . " How much shall I pay you ? " Camille reflected . He could not conceal from Faure that he could find canvases at Martin 's for from twelve to sixteen dollars each . He told Faure about them , then added : " That is a beggar 's price . The price that would satisfy me is forty dollars . " " I 'll pay it , " said Faure . " You are not a man who should be bargained down . I want harmony between us so that I will be happy every time I look at your painting . Besides , I 'm sure it 's a good investment . I plan to acquire a Manet as well . " Camille was speechless . Incredibly there was more good news to come . Guillemet took him to dinner at the home of Gustave Arosa , a banker who had heard about Faure 's purchase and seen Camille 's canvases at Guillemet 's . He also wanted a painting . " My brother Achille will want one too . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price you consider fair . I will pay it for this scene of Louveciennes . " Next , a friend from the Academie Suisse , Lecreux by name , had interested some people in his home town of Lille , north toward the Belgian border , in Camille 's St. Thomas paintings . Could Camille come quickly to Lille with two of his oils on panels ? He took the train the next morning , found that Lecreux had done a splendid sales job and received cash for his two paintings of 1855 and 1856 , Coconut Palms by the Sea and Two Women Conversing on the Seashore . Julie was stunned by the news and the envelope of bank notes . " I do n't know what foot to dance on ! You 'll keep selling ? " " In Caracas they say : Good fortune is no more permanent thanbad . ' " If Camille was having a run of luck , the times were hard for the other artists of the Cafe Guerbois . Claude Monet had improved the battered old house in Bougival for Leonie and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support was Frederic Bazille who , out of kindness , had offered to send him ten dollars a month against the purchase of Woman in the Garden , in which Monet 's lovely young mistressposed in each of her four brilliantly striped and tailored gowns brought over from a better day with her parents . Monet confessed to Camille what he had been forced to write to Bazille : " Dear friend , do you want to know in what situation I am , and how I live during the week I have waited for your letter ? Well , ask Renoir who brings us bread from his mother 's house so that we do n't die of hunger . For a week , no bread , no wine , no fire for cooking , no light . It 's atrocious . " Yet when Monet set up his easel with Camille on the road to Versailles , each painting the same scene from differing angles , all deprivationfell away . The canvases exploded with color , with the short vibrant brush strokes which brought a sense of palpitant reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to go with his model Lise to live with her parents in their country cottage . Camille received a letter from Anton Melbye in Hamburg informing him that Fritz Melbye had died in Shanghai , at the age of forty-three . A number of his Chinese and Japanese paintings had found their way back to Copenhagen . Shortly after , Camille learned that Anton himself had had a stroke which left him nearly paralyzed . David Jacobsen also fell ill . A Danish doctor visiting Paris raised the money to send him to the warmer climate of Italy , which the Copenhagen Academy hadp302never voted to do . Camille accompanied him to the railroad station . David was weak of knee and white of color , but his spirits were high . " I 'll recover in Florence , Rome , Naples . I 'll paint beautifully there . " As he left the railroad station Camille slipped a few bank notes into Jacobsen 's pocket ; the Danish doctor had been able to raise little more than the train fare and a month 's board . A new rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused excitement at the Guerbois . This year the jury would be selected by a vote of those artists who had shown at former Salons . No one knew whose idea it was but , once launched , the Guerbois group entered into it with enthusiasm . " If we elect our jury , " they told each other , " all of our people will exhibit . " The group chose its jury , campaigned to have their friends elected : Daubigny , Millet , Corot of the older school ; Manet , Daumier , Courhet , Gautier of the newer . Emile Zola published two articles in the newspapersasking all Salon artists to vote for the Guerbois selection . Of their list Daubigny and Corot were elected ; but they had also been backed by the Beaux-Arts Institute . Nevertheless the Salon was an outstanding success for the Guerbois or Batignolles group . Camille exhibited two canvases , Autumn and Landscape , Degas had one , but of a startling beauty . Bazille exhibited his Summer Scene and Bathers ; Renoir a luscious female nude Bather ; Sisley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lecture ; Berthe Morisot , The Artist 's Sister Edma and Their Mother ; Manet , a portrait of the gorgeous Eva Gonzales , his student and mistress , which drove Berthe Morisot into an icy jealousy . Claude Monet and Paul Cezanne were rejected categorically . Daubignyfought hard for Monet but could not get him admitted . Furious , he resigned from the jury saying : " From the moment I liked this picture , Madame Monet in a Red Cap , I would n't allow my opinion to be contradicted . As well say that I do n't know my trade . " Corot , who had no more liking for Monet 's canvases than he had for Camille 's , resigned from the jury out of loyalty to Daubigny . Theodore Duret , Guerbois regular , art critic and brandy distributor , published his feelings about Camille 's work : . . . If Pissarro is a realist in his determination to reproduce exactly the scene before him , he is not a thoroughgoing real/ist in the sense that certain other painters are , who see no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its innermost meaning . On the contrary , he stamps his every canvas with a feeling for life . Theodore Duret , a tall , slim , handsomely garbed and bewhiskered man with a sensitive oval face , then purchased two of Camille 's Louveciennes paintings . The exhibition , the praise , the sale , the fact that Martin was still enthusiastic as his dealer , brought Camille a sense of well-being . Julie , contented in her large comfortable house on the Route de Versailles , became pregnant again . The Paris journals of the early months of 187o had been filled with the question of an impending war with Prussia . The problem had arisen in 1861 when the French sided with Poland in its demand for national identity . Bismarck of Prussia sided with the Tsar of Russia , crushing the Poles and diminishing French prestige . Prussia and Austriathen invaded the Danish provinces of Schleswig and Holstein and , in 1866 , Prussia subdued the Austrians , becoming the dominant force in Europe . Napoleon III asked Bismarck to cede to France the left bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prussian royal family on the Spanish throne , the French were outraged . They declared war on Prussia on July 19 , 1870 , confident that their army would be victorious . In L ' Univers , Camille read : The war in which we are about to engage is , on the part of France , neither the work of a party nor an adventure imposed by the sovereign . The nation undertakes it willingly . La Liberte wrote : For several days we have not ceased to call for war . We have asked for it in all our prayers . The future . . . our soul and our conscience tell us that , in acting thus and in demanding war , we have obeyed the duty which , outside of all other considerations , the dignity and the honor France imposes upon us.  |p304In  the streets of Paris dense crowds forced the omnibuses off their usual routes ; the " Marseillaise " was sung at cafe concerts . An observer noted : " Not only the capital , but every city , every village of France , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few Frenchmen who were not carried away by the popular excitement . " The South German states , considering France the aggressor , joined Bismarck and the North German states , putting their armies under the military genius of the German Von Moltke . Despite the wild displays of patriotism , the French armies were neither equipped nor prepared for a major war . On August 4 the Germans crossed the border into Alsace . One French army was defeated at Wissembourg , followed by a disaster at Sedan in which Napoleon III and one hundred thousand of his troops were captured . Napoleon III 's regime was overthrown and a citizens ' government formed . By mid-August Paris was besieged by the German army . It was then that Camille heard the first artillery fire . Manet , Degas and Bazille enlisted ; Manet and Degas in the Home Guard . Alfred fled to London with his wife Marie and their infant son Frederic . " What about us ? " Julie demanded , close to term . " Do n't we have to get the children away ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montfoucault . " While Julie packed a couple of valises , Camille set his studio in order , putting drawings , watercolors , oils , painting equipment in their proper niches . As he was finishing he heard carriage wheels scream to a stop before his gate . Claude Monet rushed in , a bundle of rolled canvases under each arm . " Pissarro , may I store these paintings with you ? I 'm getting out before the Prussians cut the railroad lines . One year in the army is enough for me . I 'm not going to be caught and pressed into military service . I 'm due to be called up November I. " Camille looked quickly at the new canvases . They were brightly colored scenes of a fashionable resort beach . " Where did you paint these ? " " At Trouville . " " That 's an expensive plage . " Monet blushed . " When I married Leonie in June her father tricked us out of her dowry . But we did get the interest on it , two hundred and forty dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where will you go now ? " " To London . I ca n't take Leonie or the boy . There 's only enough money for one ticket . I 'm sending them to Brittany , near Boudin . I 've asked him to watch over them . I 'm taking my own particular hell across the Channel with me . I 'll land in London without friends or a way to eat . They 'll be better off than I. " Eleven years before , when Camille had first met him at the Academie Suisse , Claude Monet had been the handsomest young man of the painters ' group ; now he looked beaten , stooped under a burden of nonsuccess too heavy for his sloping shoulders . His eyes were one moment bold and haughty , the next cringing . In Paris it was said of him that his principle was to have no principle . Though his cheeks above the black beard were unlined , his spirit showed rifts and gullies . " Stack your paintings . They 'll be safe here unless the Prussians occupy the area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they reached Montfoucaultthey were shocked to see how run down the farm and house were . The wartime moratorium on rents applied to Piette 's apartment house in Paris , and Piette was deprived of the money he had been using to pay for his farm help . Some of the workers had joined the army , others had moved to jobs where wages were paid . " I 've been left alone on a farm which needs half a dozen hands . I can barely take care of the animals , let alone harvest the fields and orchards . The only cash I have is borrowed from the bank . " Piette was forlorn . The meticulous beard was untrimmed and straggly , the upswept curl at the forehead gray . Camille remembered him as he had painted his portrait nine years before . Now , at forty-four , the eyes seemed to have retreated into their sockets and to burn dimly . " You have to have an inner force to paint , " Piette cried . " I work all day as a laborer on my farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad painter because I have had to be a farmer ? Or am I a bad farmer because I want to he a painter ? " " You ale my closest friend , " responded Camille , hugging the man.  | " That makes you , in my eyes at least , a great human being in this selfdestructiveworld . " The years appeared to lift off Piette 's shoulders . " Why ca n't we all live here together ? Adele could be a second mother to Lucien and Minette . We 'd have time to paint together and work the farm only enough to pay the bills . Then I would no longer feel as though I 'm betraying my generations of ancestors who built Montfoucault . " Adele had been in bed for several weeks , unable to care for the house . A layer of dust overlay the tables in the parlor . The kitchen where Piette had ineptly been trying to cook for the two of them was an unbelievable field of battle : unwashed skillets , open jars of jellies showing a green mold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Julie were led into Adele 's bedroom they found her olive skin pallid , a smoldering fever in her eyes . When she saw them she burst into tears , whether of joy or despair they could not fathom . Heavy as she was with child , Julie put on an apron , scrubbed the neglected stove , washed the pots and dishes , then lighted a fire of kindling and dead branches and put up the largest tub she could find and filled it with water . When it boiled she ordered the men to carry it upstairs . When the two women reappeared Adele had been scrubbed " like a little child , " Julie whispered to Camille , " with rough toweling . " She had washed Adele 's hair , combed it into a neat coiffure . Adele was fully dressed . There was a touch of color in her cheeks . " Piette , " she cried , " go kill us a pullet . Bring in some fruit and vegetables , some cheese . Julie 's going to help me cook a celebration dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a fire that Piette had laidand lighted , Camille thanked Julie for what she had done for Adele . " What was the illness that kept her in bed ? " Julie asked . " Unhappiness , I guess . Loneliness , like she told you . The failingfarm . Being unable to conceive . Piette 's being unable to paint . . . . " " It was the ugly war that brought us here . But I think God knew theyneeded us . " Piette painted Camille 's portrait in gouache , out in the cold sun , with defoliated trees behind him . Camille was dressed in a floppy felt hat jammed down over his ears , a warm wool scarf knotted at his throat , standing a few feet from his easel analyzing the components of the countryside before him . Piette caught him to the life : sturdy legsp307spread apart , right arm holding his palette at stomach height , trunk poised to react from his palette onto canvas the instant he made his decision . When Piette finished his Pissarro at His Easel , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good , Piette . Vivid , balanced , true . You caught the core of me . Why do you say you ca n't paint anymore ? " Piette flushed . " Affection mixes well with gouache . With anything . " There was no question of Piette 's enlisting . " If I left the farm now the animals would be stolen or die . No crops planted in the spring . " " Raising food is more important , " Camille agreed . He looked anxiouslyat Julie . " But I really should return to Paris and enlist in the Home Guard , if they 'll take a Danish citizen . " Julie looked at him with troubled eyes . " You ca n't leave with the baby coming . " Rumor had it that Paris was suffering : its supplies depleted ; the Prussians demanding a surrender . He wrote to his mother that he intended to enlist once the baby was born . Rachel 's reply came quickly : " You know that I absolutely have need of you so do n't do anything imprudent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for London for Emma 's funeral , " bequeathing all I possess of worldly goods to MademoiselleJulie Vellay . " He had no worldly goods aside from his paintings . As his patriotism to France 's new republican government grew he realized that there was one thing more he must do : marry Julie so that their three children would become legitimate . He wrote to his mother with care and zeal the most eloquent letter he had ever written . It must have been , for by return mail Rachel gave her tentative permission : " I do n't approve of your marriage . I never shall . But if I must have three grandchildren they should be legitimate . Marry , if you must . Then let me hear no more about it . " Camille was jubilant . . . . After twelve years ! " I 'm still the mayor here , " Piette told them ; " but I do n't have the authority to marry people . The mayor of Mayenne is an old friend of my father 's . I 'll ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cosign the marriage certificate with me . " Julie was filled with song :  | " There was a lady Tartine Bread In a fine palace of fresh butter . The walls were of flour , The floor was of biscuits , Her bedroom was of wheat , Her bed of pastry : It 's very good at night . " Adele planned a picnic for the day . Then came a second letter . Rachel had written it the morning following her consent . Camille opened it with quivering fingers , read the first few lines , moaned , " Oh no ! " and sank into the middle of the russet-colored sofa . " My mother has changed her mind , " he cried out . Julie burst into tears . Adele sat her down , then crouched before her , attempting to comfort her . Julie took the blow as though a knife had been thrust through her . Camille read in a monotone : " ' As a mother , to make you happy , and without reflection I have answered yes . That caused me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write to say that this consent distresses me very much . I rely on you then and if you have some consideration for me you will send me back the letter because I had it written without sufficient thought for a matter of importance . Wait until all these events are over , then you could go to London and there marry without my consent and without anyone knowing about it . ' " Piette suggested weakly that they pretend the second letter never reached them . " There 's a war on . . . . Your wedding will be a faitaccompli . " Camille could see Julie trembling across the room . He turned to Piette : " We must not complicate our problem with deceit . " He rose , paced the floor , ended in front of Julie . " We will go to England and be married there . After the baby is born , after the war . " The baby was born , a girl , on October 21 , 18 70 . They named her Adele Emma . It was a difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became ill . She did not have sufficient milk for the infant . Rachel , when she received Camille 's news , responded generously , sending a layette for the infant and an extra hundred francs . She wrote :  | " Hire the best wet nurse in the neighborhood . Use the extra money for that purpose . After a couple of months you 'll be able to put heron a bottle . " It was the first break in Rachel 's solid rejection . Piette scoured the countryside and succeeded in finding a young mother who would have enough milk for her own child and Adele Emma as well . The infant sucked robustly for a few days , then began to fail . Piette brought out their family doctor from Mayenne . He examined the child , questioned the young wet nurse . When he came from Julie 's bedroom he was shaking his leonine head in anger and despair . " The wet nurse has an intestinal infection . She has most likely passed it on to the child . " Camille asked numbly , " What can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim frustration . " I do n't know . Get a new wet nurse , if it 's not too late . " It was . Adele Emma lived only two weeks . Julie was crushed . The four of them buried the infant behind the house . Piette askedsolicitously : " Would you like me to drive you into Mayenne to register the birth and death ? " " What purpose ? " Julie asked bitterly . " She 's come and gone as though she was never here . " Camille put his arms about her shoulders , walked her back to the house . " It was an accident of fate . We 'll do better next time . " Piette drove Camille in his carriage to the mairie of the neighboring village of Lassay where he signed the death certificate . Paris was under heavy bombardment from enemy artillery . The battalionsof the Garde Nationale were trying to relieve the siege of the city . Unlike the previous rumor , the Revue des Deux Mondes , which reached Pierre by mail , declared that Paris had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p310Our  situation is beginning to become strange . . . . Paris , locked in its armor of iron , goes to sleep each evening , and each morning awakens , taking up ordinary life again . . . it forms a state by itself , a society , a world limited for the momentby St. Denis and Clamart , by St. Cloud and Vincennes . Beyond this horizon . . . is Prussia encamped and immobilizedbefore the guns of our forts . Paris had prepared itself for a siege in spite of the fact that its Premier had declared war " with a light heart . " The city was stocked with animals for slaughter ; the Luxembourg Garden was filled with sheep . In the Bois de Boulogne there were forty thousand oxen and another quarter million sheep . A flour mill was set up in the Gare du Nord , the Louvre became an armament workshop , the Gare d'Orleans an observation balloon factory , the Gare de Lyon a cannon factory . Rachel escaped to London . The Isaacsons found a home for her to share with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flat for Camille . " My whole family is in England , " Camille told Julie . " A lot of French painters are already there . " " They hate me . If Emma was still alive , yes . I 've read her daughter Amelie 's letters to you . She never mentions my name . " " Now , Julie , Amelie liked you when she was a child . " She gave him a pitying look , then shrugged slightly . " The three of us are yours . Do what you will . " He needed train fare and boat fare across the English Channel . The midwife , doctor and wet nurse had been paid the last of his francs . Je suis desole , " Piette murmured . " I have n't a dozen francs to give you . The following evening the elderly Georges Thouvenal came to see how they were faring . When he learned that Camille could not take his family to England because of lack of money , he asked : " Camille , your mother said that in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How much will that require ? " " About sixty dollars . " " Very well , I will lend you the money . Name your next son after me . That 's my interest rate . " It would have been a shorter distance to go directly to Le Havre from Mayenne , but there was no railroad line connecting the two points.  |p311Travel  by carriage or coach would have taken a number of days . Since the Gare St. Lazare was still open Camille took his family into Paris , then boarded the first train for Le Havre . They reached there in the early afternoon only to find there was no steamer crossing that night . One would leave Dieppe at midnight . They caught the coach to Dieppe , boarded the steamer and , after a long night huddled together in the smoke-laden salon , reached the shores of England . Emma 's oldest son , twenty-one-year-old Rodolphe , met them at the railroad station with a carriage . He had been Camille 's companion during the period of Emma 's funeral and mourning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Passy . He greeted Julie shyly , then drove them slowly to the London suburb of Lower Norwood . " I can paint this countryside , " Camille declared , his eyes on the passing landscape . Julie , do n't you find it charming ? " Julie did not reply . She found it charming that she was soon to be married . . . if she was . Their flat was upstairs of Canham 's Dairy . The rooms were adequate , the windows admitting the dull winter light . The furniture had been scuffed by a series of transients . But the Thouvenal loan would cover the rent . The home occupied by Rachel and Alfred and his family was a short distance away ; but neither Rachel nor Marie visited Julie . Camille was welcome to bring the children , without Julie , to visit in Rachel 's half of the house only , a concession on her part . Alfred was doing business through Isaacson 's commission merchant 's firm in the Strand six days a week . When Camille visited his mother , Rachel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the greengrocer . Julie commented , " I do n't like an R burned into my behind the way you did n't like an R stamped on the back of your pictures . " " When we marry there will be an A for Acceptance stamped on your wedding certificate . " " When ? " " As quickly as I can sell something . I want to pay for the wedding with money I earned . I will start to paint right away . I should soon have something worth selling . " " Everything 's worth selling . Can you make something worth buy-ing ? " Julie escaped the small apartment by walking with the children in thep312streets , taking them to the park . Without a word of English , they clung to each other , feeling completely isolated in a strange land . " I should never have brought you into this heartless family , " Camillecommented . " Better to have let you go your own way . You would have found a Louis Estruc in Paris , the way your sister did . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grief . " " And maybe no love . " She kissed him hungrily . " A woman ca n't be without love . " Frederic Bazille was killed at the battle of Beaune-la-Rolande . Since he had refused to shave off his beard the only faction of the French army that would accept him was the Zouaves . The Zouaves had engaged in the fiercest of the fighting . His father had had to search for two days among the corpses of the battlefield to find his son and take him back to Montpellier for burial . As had the others in the Guerbois group , Camille had loved this extraordinarily tall , gaunt , fun-loving , generous , enormously talented young man who , even among artist eccentrics , had stood out for his unpredictable idiosyncrasies . Along with the brokenhearted regret came an inevitable sense of guilt . While it was true that many of his close friends , younger men , Frenchmen , had not participated in the war  --  Monet , Sisley , Cezanne , Zola  --  there was still a residue at the bottom of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped to England , allowing Frederic Bazille to bleed to death on the battlefield . He put on his sabots , planted his easel down the hill from the flat . It was a short road , curving and struggling uphill , covered with a thin layer of ice , the rest of the snow heaped in rows along the bank . He liked roads ; they went somewhere , they connected here with there , were lines of communication . There was a little man in black garb trudging upward , the suggestion of two heavily coated women walking down . There was a leafless tree in the foreground , a few scattered houses on either side , seemingly a dead-life of winter yet alive with the implicit promise of spring . A desolate scene of no desolation whatever ; only the suspended animation of the road and the people within the homes . A light trail of smoke came out of the misted pastel stucco house on the left , a fire lighted by people inside awaiting the miracle of rebirth . Christmas was just ahead . His family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festival of Lights . There was no possibility of persuadingany of them to come to his flat fin- dinner . He bought a bunch ofp313holly at a florist , some toys for the children , and a turkey which Julie stuffed with fresh chestnuts and veal . A black plum pudding was filled with fruit and raisins . She steamed the pudding , Camille added a half cup of the brandy Alfred had given him as a gift , set it aflame . Lucien and Minette cried their " Ohs ! " and " Ahs ! " Camille exclaimed : " Now you have an English Christmas . " Julie , happy with the celebration , laughed : " They will learn to be fire-eaters like jugglers at the fair . " She related to her young the nativity of Christ ; Camille told of the restoring of the Perpetual Light in the First Temple after its desecrationby the Romans . The children enjoyed both stories . Julie practiced her Catholicism silently in her prayers and remembrances of the movingrituals in the church of Val des Dames in Grancey . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the beginning that to bring up her children as Catholics would create an even greater chasm between the little ones and their grandmother . She nourished hopes of reconciliation , for them at least . In January when the painting Lower Norwood , Effect of Snow had dried , he took it into London , an hour 's train ride . He was headed for the German Gallery of Paul Durand-Ruel at 168 New Bond Street . Paul Durand-Ruel 's father had opened a gallery in the Rue de la Paix and . helped by his son , created one of the most respected galleries in Paris . selling the Fontainebleau School painters before they were established . The father had died in 1865 , at which time the son took over He was said to have an infallible eye for good and bad work . At the outbreak of the war he sent his wife and five children to his in-laws it Perigord in southwest France then , before the railroads were cut , bast. ily packed up his pictures and dispatched them to London . On hi ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Camille was taking his picture to Paul Durand-Ruel because in the magazine Durand-Ruel had founded in 1869 , International Review of Ar and Curiosity , he had spoken well of Camille 's canvas at the 1868 Salon lhr German ( ; allcry was more spacious and better lighted than any he had found in Parts . I'he pictures were hung so that neither theme notp314color clashed , and were exhibited on only two levels , comfortable to the eye . " Mon Dieu ! " Camille gasped . " Durand-Ruel has nothing but master-pieces . " He went from picture to picture , studying the best work of Gericault , Corot , Millet , Courbet , Daubigny , Diaz , Dupre , magnificent watercolorsby Daumier and Barye , the sculptor who had grown up with his Fontainebleau friends . To Gamille 's astonishment he saw on the wall a painting by Claude Monet , Entrance to Trouville Harbor . " Monet must have brought that one under his arm . How did he get hung so fast ? " Durand-Ruel was out . His assistant said : " Monsieur Daubigny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is he in England ? " " He came before the war . You can find him in the French quarter , at the Hotel de la Boule d'Or in Percy Street , or at Audinet 's Restaurant in Charlotte Street . " " Would you have Monsieur Monet 's address ? " " No , but Monsieur Daubigny will have it . Why not leave your paintingfor Monsieur Durand-Ruel to see ? Monsieur Daubigny speaks of your work with high praise . " Camille received a note from Durand-Ruel almost immediately . " You have brought me a charming picture and I regret not having been at my gallery to pay my respects in person . Tell me , please , the price you would want ; be kind enough to send me others as soon as you can . I must sell a lot of your work here . Your friend Monet asked me for your address . He lives at i Bath Place , Kensington . " He started at once on another snow effect and a view of Upper Norwood . He also decided to seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other . Monet had little more than a rented room , with a narrow cot in a corner , an easel and a table . He had begun a couple of oils in the London parks but nothing was finished . " How is our indestructible Julie ? " Monet asked . " Unhappy in a flat in Lower Norwood . What about Leonie ? " " She 's lonely . So am I. I must get back to her . This accursed war ! " His mood shifted as though the sun had darted out from a black cloud . " Paul Durand-Ruel bought a canvas I brought with me . He paid me sixty dollars . Is n't that fantastic ? I sent half the money to Leonie . " " I saw the picture there . I did n't know he had bought it . Congratula-tions. "  |p315Camille  wrung Monet 's hand . Monet 's face broke into a broad grin . " He has promised to buy another as soon as I can conquer these peculiarly English parks . " " I also took Durand-Ruel a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it and asked me to show him others . Daubigny has spoken well of my work . " " Daubigny ! Our paterfamilias . Durand-Ruel has the most progressive gallery in Paris but neither of us dared to take our paintings in to him . Why ? " " We were too awed . Would the man who sells Rembrandt , Goya , Delacroix bother with novices ? He seemed to be a devout monarchist in politics and a radical in art . Can you imagine such a combination ? " They went to a small restaurant operated by an exiled French couple where they drank a toast to their dead friend , Frederic Bazille . Then explored their chances of earning a living in London . " We should submit to the Royal Academy exhibition , " Camille suggested . " They will be judging soon . " Claude Monet visited Lower Norwood at noon on Sunday , kissed Julie affectionately on both cheeks , presented her with a winter plant . They spent the afternoon in a flow of reminiscences : Paris , Pontoise , Louveciennes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He suggested they visit the British and South Kensington museums . " We can study Turner , Constable , Gainsborough . I wanted to do that fifteen years ago when I came from St. Thomas but my sister Delphine was dying . " " Turner 's Venetian scenes are a riot of color , " said Monet . " No one understood fog in London until Constable put it on canvas . " " Monet 's fond of you , Julie , " said Camille after he had left . " He knows what a treasure you are to me . " Julie turned her back and crossed herself . Camille completed his painting of Upper Norwood . There were differences in the French and English countrysides , yet he felt them to be equally strong , calling forth the same truths . While the canvas dried he wrote for an appointment with Durand-Ruel and arrived at the German Gallery to find an imposing figure filling the doorway . Paul Durand-Ruel was about forty , with a long oval face , a striking head of hair , a touch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache ; and a superb pair of smoke-gray eyes . He was squeezed into a black frock coat topped with a new high top hat.  |p316Meeting  him elsewhere , Camille might have taken him for a provincial notary or suburban solicitor : punctual , methodical , stiff . Yet his expressionand personality belied his attire . He was attractive in the best French tradition . " A likable man , " Camille concluded . Paul Durand-Ruel was also a strict Catholic , attending an eight o'clock mass every morning of his life ; a rigid moralist who made no attempt to judge the personal ethics or relationships of his painters . He had traveled to Belgium , Holland , Germany , England , trumpeting the extraordinary qualities of the Fontainebleau School as well as Courbet and Delacroix , selling them for sizable prices and establishing himself as an international dealer . With his profits he had bought Rembrandt , El Greco , Velasquez , Goya , no one of whom was particularlyfashionable or salable at the time . Now he was looking for the next wave of painters who would succeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , Monsieur Pissarro , I am enchanted to meet you . You have brought me a second canvas . Let us go back to my office and set it on my easel . " With his high silk hat off , Durand-Ruel looked a little less formidable and became less so every moment as he exclaimed : " It is the triumph of living art over academic art . Not clever , not smooth . Rough and true . Pushing out in a new direction . " " Can you sell these pictures , Monsieur Durand-Ruel ? " " What is accepted by the current fashion is always sold more easily than the work of the artists whom the public understands less the more original and personal they are . But I have a list of my early buyers here who may be willing to invest in the future rather than the past . I will slip your paintings into my exhibition . . . " Camille 's heart skipped a few beats. . . and I will pay you forty dollars each for the two paintings after I sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camille 's heart ceased beating entirely . Durand-Ruel reached for his hat . His family had recently arrived from Perigord . " Would you like to ride home with me to Brompton Crescent , near the South Kensington Museum ? I rented a small house with a garden there . " Camille was eager to go to Julie with the news but found it impolite not to accompany the dealer.  |p317Madame  Durand-Ruel proved to be young and intelligent . Her husbandleaned on her for counsel in his business affairs and her advice proved sound . Three of the children attended a Jesuit school and were old enough to sit at table . Durand-Ruel had also brought his elderly Aunt Louise to London , a tante for the five children . " If my husband says that you and Claude Monet are corners , you must be , " Madame Durand-Ruel volunteered . Camille added softly , " He has also expressed an interest in others of our Guerbois group . He is unlike any other dealer . He appears to have a group vision rather than a myopic view of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life story . " In my youth I wanted to become a missionary or an officer . My antecedents really determined my course . When my mother and father married they were given a paper mill worth two thousand dollars , plus four hundred dollars in cash . My father transformed the mill into a stationery store as well as a supply shop for painting materials . He accepted paintings in exchange for colors and brushes and rented them to academies for artists to copy from . In 1839 he sold the mill , opened a true gallery on the Rue de la Paix and held his first show , for which he printed a catalogue of twenty-five plates . He bought seventy paintings from Theodore Rousseau , perhaps the first time a dealer had tried to establish a trust , ' as he described it , with a painter . " When I took over , the gallery needed a lot of capital and willingness to stick to prices , " he confided . " I did well for a time but my taste was more farsighted than immediate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew that a dealer should back an artist in whom he has faith , acquire all his work . Even as artists must acknowledge they are a brotherhood and must support each other . " You told me on the trip out that you came to Paris in 1855 in time to see the Exposition Universelle . Millet exhibited one canvas there , depictinga peasant grafting a tree . The press attacked it violently . Millet was destitute . His friend and neighbor , Rousseau , had just had the good fortune to come into some money . He told Millet that an art lover had directed him to purchase the Tree Grafter for eighty dollars . Rousseauknew that Millet would never have accepted the money if he were aware that the buyer were Rousseau himself , for frequently Rousseau was as impoverished as Millet . That story stands for me as the symbol . Perhaps that 's why artists survive in a hostile world . "  |p318Camille  left for his flat as quickly as he dared . With eighty dollars he could pay his debts , buy the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which to marry Julie ! Paris had held out honorably until January 28 , 1871 , at which time it succumbed to lack of food , ammunition , medical supplies , to superiorityof numbers . Camille gathered from the English press and French journals reaching him that negotiations had begun on a treaty but there were two governments in France : one headed by Thiers as Chief Executive , who was attempting to recapture the earlier Republic ; the other a spontaneous uprising of people who distrusted Thiers and his National Assembly in Versailles because it represented primarily the provinces . They believed the Assembly guilty of allowing the Prussians to tear the country apart and of rescinding the moratorium on rents . They had opposed the monarchy and now opposed any republican government from Versailles even though it was an elected one . They assembled their available arms in the city parks . When Thiers attempted to recover " weapons stolen from the state , " a battle broke out . The people of Paris won , elected a municipal council named the Commune of Paris , and became known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They wanted a Republic of Paris , independent of the rest of France . Camille went into London to see Durand-Ruel , who had just returned from France , distraught . " My galleries , which I left in the care of one of my employees , must have been converted into a field hospital . The very morning of my arrival two generals had been assassinated in Montmartre . What sense does it make to have a Paris unrelated to the rest of France ? We must become a unified country again if we are to survive . " Camille 's two paintings had not yet been hung in Durand-Ruel 's gallery but he continued to work , and moved his family to more spaciouslodgings at 2 Chatham Terrace , near where the London Crystal Palace of 1851 had been moved from Hyde Park . Julie took the children to see the industrial exhibits and the entertainments . Camille began painting the glass structure.  |p319He  also completed oils of the church of Weston Hill and the road by Sydenham with its church bordered by an alley of green trees , against which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue , green and pearl gray . Then he painted the Penge Station , with the train as minuscular as the workers in a field . The curving railroad tracks in the center provided locomotion to the viewer . The train tracks seemed a natural outcropping . When their money for food and paint began to run low he went to Alfred , asking for a loan until Durand-Ruel should pay for his pictures . Alfred told him he was sorry but he was earning only enough from the Isaacson firm to support his family . Both Camille and Claude Monet were rejected by the Royal Academy ; of the French artists the English liked only Ger6me and Rosa Bonheur . Corot and the Fontainebleau School did not yet exist for them . English painters were unsympathetic ; the art market was small . Claude Monet was bitter . He had a drink with Camille in the French quarter in Fitzroy Square . " I 'm leaving . Going to Holland . They 're more hospitable there . The first day of peace I 'll be back in France with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentative sun emerged , Camille went over to Dulwich College with his easel and canvas to paint the pond , surroundinglawns and trees in front of the main building . A couple of the trees were growing a pale green foliage , there was a thin blue sky , the college buildings were a washed brick red , the pond reflected light yellow to burnt umber . A woman 's figure , vaguely indicated , stood at the near bank of the pond , put there to suggest that this was an inhabited place . It was not a realistic portrait of Dulwich College . He had done his impression of the buildings , trees , pond , woman shimmeringin the uncertain light of the pre-spring day . He had hoped that James McNeill Whistler , who had been an integral part of the group in Paris , would afford him hospitality and introducehim to a few English artists and collectors . But no one knew where Whistler was ; " in the country somewhere . " Alfred Sisley , who had joined his English family , was also not heard from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saw-toothed edge of self-centeredness in the struggle to stay alive . In a depressed mood he wrote to Thodore Duret : " It is only abroad that one feels how beautiful , great and hospitable France is  |p320Toward  the end of February Prussian troops had occupied Louveciennes . He received a note from a pleasant young man named Edouard Beliard who lived across the hall from Rachel 's apartment in Paris and occasionally ran an errand for her , for which he had thanked the man and made some suggestions about his drawings . Beliard wrote : " Your blankets , suits , shoes , underclothes you may go into mourningfor . Your sketches , since they are generally admired , I like to think will be ornaments in Prussian drawing rooms . The nearness of the forest will no doubt have saved your furniture . " " But it 's my work I 'm worrying about , " Camille cried . " Hundreds of watercolors , drawings . . . my oils . " " I 'm more worried about my furniture , " Julie responded . The post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Copenhagen he learned that David had taken his own life by jumping out of the window of his lodgings in Florence . His tuberculosis was fatally advanced ; he owed the landlord for rent . His small stove had been given to an Italian friend who had paid for his meals during the winter . David was buried in the Jewish cemetery in Florence . His letters , drawings and paintings were sent home to his brother Edvard . Camille was saddened ; but he was not taken by surprise . Shopping was torture for Julie . She could neither talk to the vendors nor bargain . " In England you do n't have to bargain , " Camille explained . " The price is marked on everything . Use that chart I gave you converting pence and pounds into centimes and francs . You have only to look at the figures and compare . Then you 'll know what things cost . " " Easy for you to say . The curious noises they make ; is that a lan-guage ? " " Yes , Julie . There are dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound to us like ' curious noises , ' as ours does to them . " He took Julie to the Isaacson home , gambling that Rachel 's animositycould not have touched all of Emma 's family . They were so cool thatJulie wept . " Why did you take me ? I 'll never go again . " When she became inconsolably homesick they went into London for afternoon tea at the Hotel de la Boule d'Or where other French expatriatesjoined them : Claude Monet , Alexandre Prevost , a painter who had shown at the Paris Salon , Charles Lecape , a refugee who had an empathy for artists . Or they went to Audinet 's Restaurant for dinnerp321with Daubigny and his friends , where Julie could hardly eat , she was so happy to be engulfed in the French language . " Oh , Camille , when can we go home ? " " As soon as there is peace . " He took her to Covent Garden , which she compared to Les Halles , and to see a touring French company playing Moliere 's hilarious farce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Cathedral at the head of Ludgate Hill ; to Trafalgar Square ; to visit the streets of the working artisans : goldsmiths , lens grinders , leather decorators , ironmongers , linen drapers . They walked along the Embankment , the docks of the river Thames with its sailing vessels and steamboats so different from the barges on the Seine . " If only I could understand ! " " Pretend you 're walking the streets of Paris . People are saying the same things . " On March 6 Durand-Ruel opened his second exhibition of French paintings , listing in his catalogue two of Camille 's works , Effect of Snow and Upper Norwood . He summoned Camille , who brought with him new canvases . After a few moments the dealer declared : " They have an inner truth . Leave them with me . I will use all the skills I 've accumulated to sell them . " He then added : " I 've sold a few things , not yours unfortunately , but I do have some assets . " He looked sharply into Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I paid him his sixty dollars immediately . How are you fixed ? " " I need the money . " " Very well . I will pay you the eighty dollars for the first two canvases now . If I do n't sell them here I 'll take them back to Paris and find collectors there . I 'll also pay you forty dollars for two more when they sell . I ca n't be wrong about your work . " On March t o , 187 t , they received a letter from Julie 's sister Felicie . The news was devastating . " Dear Julie : I went to Louveciennes yesterday and saw your house and M. 011ivon who returned two days ago . The railroad only began operating yesterday . I caught the first train , which went only as far as the bridge . I went the rest of the way to Louveciennes on foot . . . . " The houses are burned , the roofs broken , your front door , staircase and floor  --  all that has disappeared.  | " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . Monsieur 011ivon was able to save some things ; your two beds but no mattresses , your wardrobe , washstand , desk , about forty paintings , the small wooden bed . The Prussians lived for nearly four months in the house and scorched it thoroughly , but they did not find the small closet on the second floor under the staircase . Your house is uninhabitablenow , there is straw all over because the horses were kept on the ground floor and the Prussian soldiers lived upstairs . . . . " Camille was stunned . " Forty paintings ! " Two weeks later , weeks of desolation and dread , the news was confirmedby their landlord 's wife . Madame 011ivon wrote : " You are asking about your house ; that is not the right word for it ; you should say stables . There was a good two carloads of manure in your place . In the small room , next to the living room , there were horses ; the kitchen and your cellar were sheep pens , and the sheep were killed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell you that we have some paintings well preserved . . . . There are some which these gentlemen , for fear of dirtyingtheir feet , put on the ground in the garden to serve as a carpet . My husband picked them up and we have them , too . " Next he heard about the occupation 's damage from his landlord 's manager Retrou , as well as the news that the Republic had passed a law that he would have to pay the rent on the Louveciennes house for the entire time the house had been occupied by the Prussians . He wrote in reply : " . . . You tell me that a certain quantity of my affairs were saved . Some forty pictures and I had from twelve to fifteen hundred sketches , studies , paintings , the work of twenty years of my life . I think that if there is a property that is sacred it is the product of our own intelligence and made with our own hands , and yet I do n't think that at Versailles they have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Julie was pregnant again . He gave her the ritualistic kiss for such announcements , then declared : " We 'll go into Croydon and be married at the register office . " " Will your family come ? " " I 'll invite them . " They declined . " It does n't matter , " he said . " I 'll round up a couple of our French compatriots at the Hotel de la Boule d'Or . They 'll sign the marriage certificate for us. "  |p323Julie  murmured , " As you say , It fries no bananas to question life . ' My two children will be legitimate . The one coming . I will be too . " On May 21 Chief Executive Thiers signed a peace treaty agreeing to pay one billion dollars as indemnity and to cede Alsace and Lorraine to the Germans . The citizenry of Paris rose in revolt against the treaty , refused to disarm . Mayor Georges Clemenceau of Montmartre attempteda reconciliation but Chief Executive Thiers 's troops , loyal to the newly formed Republic , entered Paris by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parisians were killed , includingwomen and children . The military sweep destroyed the Paris movement . Thiers prevailed and the Republic was accepted throughoutFrance . By May 28 the Commune of Paris , which had lasted for less than two months , disappeared . That was when calamity struck Gustave Courbet . The only artist who had been deeply involved in Parisian politics , Courbet , a month after the Commune was established , had been elected a delegate to the new governing body , then became chairman of a group of artists who managed to get some of the galleries of the Louvre reopened and dispersed pictures returned to it . They abolished the Ecole des BeauxArts , established a federation of artists free from government control . Before Courbet 's election , the delegates had ordered the destruction of the Vendome Column , built to celebrate Napoleon 's war conquests , which the Parisian public loathed as a symbol of his creating still another monarchy . The column was duly demolished and the statue of Napoleon smashed , said the London Times , into splinters , a wreck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , while a band of the National Guard played the " Marseillaise . " Courbet was proclaimed the hero of the demolition . He was also arrested by the Republic and was awaiting trial in the Conciergerie prison , though , as he wrote to an English friend , Robert Reid : " I am accused of having destroyed the Column Vendome , when the fact is on the record that the decree for its destruction was voted on the 14th of April , and I was elected to the Commune on the loth , six days afterwards ! " Julie bought some light blue silk in a draper 's shop and sewed a dress for her wedding . Camille went into London to round up his French friends , Alexandre Prevost and Charles Lecape . The English official was Edwin Bailey of the register office in Croydon . The Registerwent through his brief duties , everyone signed the marriage certificate . It was June 14 , 187 1.  | " We will celebrate in Audinet 's Restaurant , " Camille announced . " With Reims champagne . " Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dissembleat Montfoucault or Louveciennes . She linked her arm affectionately through her husband's.  |p327Durand-Ruel  paid Camille eighty dollars for the second two canvasesof the English countryside though he had sold neither of the first two . " I assume you need money to get your family back to France , " he said . The Care St. Lazare in Paris was bedlam , with hundreds of families awaiting the arrival of those who had taken refuge abroad . At the height of the pandemonium Julie turned to Camille and smiled . " The curious noises they make ; is that a language ? " Felicie met them at the station , taking Julie and the two children home with her . Camille rode the train to Louveciennes over tracks that had been repaired . He was filled with trepidation . His first sight of their house was a view of four workmen installing a new roof . Monsieur 011ivon , the gray-haired , parchment-wrinkled owner , had been a formertown councilor for Louveciennes ; he was an efficient man . " Ah , Monsieur Pissarro . I 'm glad to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beam in your bedroom ; it burned when the soldiers set fire w the room . The government is paying for structural damagep328done by the cannonading and ravages of enemy troops . They 'll also pay a modest sum for your stolen or damaged furniture . " 011ivon had already put on a new front door , laid a wooden ground floor to replace the one which the horses ' hooves had carved into splinters , had had the carpenters rebuild the staircase to the bedroom floor . Camille made a quick check of the furniture . As Felicie and Madame 011ivon had written , the two larger beds were intact , as was a small wooden crib ; the mattresses had all disappeared . The desk and tables were badly scarred . The tall clock , which Julie had hidden in the closet under the staircase , was in good order . The library room off the living room had been used as a stable but the books on the shelves were undisturbed . Would the inhabitants of the land of Goethe not harm a book ? The soldiers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big kitchen , used as a sheep pen , was empty of pots , skillets and ceramic vases , the dishes broken , the walls and floors a mess . " I 'll repair the walls and floors , " 011ivon assured him . " As to Madame'skitchen utensils , you may find some of them in the garden or the surrounding woods . Consider yourself fortunate ; they slaughtered the sheep in the garden instead of in the kitchen . There 's one thing more , as the manager wrote you . You must pay the full rent for the months you were away . " Camille went ashen . " That 's eight months ! I have no such money . " Monsieur 011ivon was a compassionate man . " I know that . But it 's still your liability . You can pay it gradually , over the next year or two . " Camille groaned as he gave Monsieur 011ivon what he had left of Durand-Ruel 's eighty dollars to pay the rent for July . " How do I pay for the past when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked over the dead grass to the little stone building inside the wall that had been his studio and had also been used to stable the officers ' horses . A layer of straw and manure two feet thick covered the floors ; the smell was unbearable . His worktables were gone , as were the lower racks he had built to house his sketchbooksfrom St. Thomas , Caracas and Paris ; his pencil and charcoal drawings , his watercolors and gouaches , his oil paintings . His knees went weak , the acid of anguish and desolation ate at his stomach . He wanted to sit down but there was nowhere to sit . He wandered our top329Julie 's uprooted garden ; only the trees were alive . Off to one side he saw splotches of color which looked familiar . Digging around , he uncoveredan oil painting from Pontoise . In a half-demented frenzy he dug out with his hands more canvases that had been subjected to scuffing , rain , mud , decomposure . He clutched the bundle to his chest , ran to the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried to Monsieur011ivon . " Destroyed as though by some pounding machine . " 011ivon did not need to look at the bedraggled canvases . " The soldiers used them as mats on which to wipe their boots . " Camille kneeled on the new-laid floor . Tears burned in his eyes . Hestraightened out the canvases , one by one . " A few can be saved , " he muttered . " Retouched . There 's an expert in Paris , Armand Gautier . Madame 011ivon wrote that you had saved some of these mutilated canvases . And also some that were not harmed . Where are they ? " " In my house . In a dry place . Come , we 'll get them . It will cheer you. , , Camille 's heart leapt as he went through the canvases . Sorting them , he found undamaged seven oils , mostly from 1863 ; a half dozen from La Varenne and Montfoucault painted in 1864 ; six from La Varenne and La Roche-Guyon from 1865 ; from 1866 two Pontoise oils , one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had caused his break with Corot . For 1867 he counted eight oils from the Hermitage ; for 1868 ten more of Pontoise ; and wonder of wonders , a dozen unharmed paintings from Louveciennes painted just before the war . Fifty-one paintings in all ! It was only then that he thought of the canvases Claude Monet had left with him before fleeing to London . He ran back to the studio . Monet 's carefully wrapped bundle rested untouched on a high recessedshelf , unseen from the floor . With them was a batch of his own paintings , stored there because they were twelve inches by twenty or less , and would fit into the aperture . The hundreds of watercolors and drawings were gone , but as he squatted on the bare floor of the living room , examining one by one the blessedly saved canvases , his spirits rose . Two cart fills of manure had been cleaned out of the lower floor of the house and dumped into the garden . Camille got a shovel and , standing a to ( t &el); In droppings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of blood-soaked canvases which had been used as aprons when the soldiers killed the sheep . When he walked to the river for a respite , some of the washerwomen were also wearing the canvases as aprons wrapped around their waists . He went among them , saying nothing but appraising each painting for damage . They were watersoaked , the moisture unfastening the sizing glue and making the paint peel off . They were mangled at the corners where they were tied with string . The women looked up at him without expression . They somehowknew they were wearing his paintings , but they had not stolen them , they had found them in the streets and the woods . When he returned to the house through the village , men who had availed themselvesof his absence to loot the house and desecrate his work stared at him as though he were a stranger . " Ravages of war , " 011ivon commented when Camille told him of the unpleasantness . " Why do they sneer ? The women at the pool , the men in the streets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flee to safety while they had to remain here ; partly because they never really accepted a man who putters with paint . " Camille gave the fire-streaked walls of their bedroom a coat of white paint , as well as Julie 's kitchen and the streaked and discolored livingroomwalls . He scraped and varnished the tables . The paints and brushes used up his last change ; how to buy a new mattress for himself and Julie , another for Lucien and Minette ? How to reprovision Julie 's kitchen ? Replace blankets , linens . . . ? He framed up four of what he considered his best canvases from Louveciennes and took them to Durand-Ruel in his gallery on Rue Le Peletier . The gallery had been cleaned and redecorated , some fifty paintings were hanging in the big central room , a few old masters , a goodly group of the Fontainebleau School , Camille 's canvases from England as well as Monet 's Trouville scene . Durand-Ruel had done well in his London gallery despite the fact that he had been unable to sell a Pissarro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been caught up in the war for over a year , had begun returning , hungry for new acquisitions . He placed Camille 's four canvases in turn on his personal viewing easel , cried out with delight at their quiet beauty . " They are superb ! " he exclaimed . Then more softly : " But I shall be prudent and buy only two . I 'll take this one , The Versailles Road , and The Coach at Louveciennes. "  |p331He  used an admiring finger to trace the Louveciennes canvas , twenty-five by thirty-four inches . Two white horses pulling a travelercoachwith the barely suggested image of a driver perched on top ; a man and woman waiting to board ; a short stretch of wet road cobbled with splashes of yellow and green rain under leafy-topped trees . On the one side a two-story house with a front garden ; on the other , the suggestion of a woman walking along a path with a raised green umbrella ; and walking toward her , his umbrella rolled tight , a man with his back to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a coach in the rain , a wet road and wet white horses , a house , trees , a few small figures . Yet the world in situ . My dear Pissarro , looking at your painting , all the tension in my bosom is released . You make me feel as though the world is good . " " That 's how I felt while painting it . " " Ah ! The Versailles Road . Would that be your wife and daughter in your front garden behind the picket fence ? " " It would be . Chatting with the bonne from the house of Madame and Monsieur Retrou next door . " " You do have the ability to draw us into the heart of a picture , " the dealer commented . " A sense of man and the earth being eternal . Your paintings have God in them . It 's a remarkable gift . So simple and so profound . " Camille quipped out of sheer joy : " Monsieur Durand-Ruel , you have convinced me . I will buy both paintings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed like an actuary and kept the mask of an advocate on his handsome lean face , the leonine head of always meticulously brushed hair swept back from his high brow , was enraptured with art . " Shall we say fifty dollars for each canvas ? " he asked . Camille trembled inwardly . Whom should he thank that such a good man had appeared on earth ? He would be able to make the house livable again . From the Durand-Ruel gallery he went to his mother 's apartment in Montmartre . The house had been untouched by the bombing . Stored at the back of one of her closets he found several pictures from 1861 , a black chalk of the Rue St. Vincent in Montmartre , among others . She had also retained his pencil sketch of her from 1856 , and his SelfPortraitas a ' bung Man from the same period . Ile told her of his twop332sales that day , showed her the hundred dollars in bank notes to prove that he was telling the truth . Rachel proffered her congratulations . " Then you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good feeling to be independent at last . " Camille was silent ; he had not expected such a response . " A very good feeling , " he replied a little hollowly . Then added , " Julie is expecting again , in November . " Rachel had grown accustomed to Julie 's frequent pregnancies . " Alfred is too busy recovering his business to come to midday dinner . I want you to promise you 'll come . " " I want a promise in return . That after the baby is born you 'll come out to visit us . " It was his mother 's turn to fall silent . " So that 's your price for independence ! " With the money from Durand-Ruel Camille bought mattresses for their beds , a minimum of sheets , towels . The teapot , cups and saucers Emma had brought as a gift several years before had all been destroyed , as had the tablecloths . He gave Julie money to replace the broken dishes , the ruined skillets , the kettle , spit for roasting , earthenwarejugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables . They straightened and hammered out the dents in the boiling pots and cutlery . Julie 's first task was to get rid of the manure dumped in her back garden and to soak the land : that much fertilizer would burn the seeds and bulbs . She planted tomatoes , corn , zucchini , squash and pumpkin . In her flower garden she set out asters , chrysanthemums , zinnias , marigolds and dahlias from bulbs . Camille asked doubtfully , watching her : " Can you bring them up ? " " Can you paint pictures ? " " It 's July . We may get some cool days but August is a horror . That 's why they lock up Paris for the month . " " If you had seen the miserable piece of ground where I raised vegetables at the bottom of the Rue Neuve you would know I can raise vegetables anywhere , any time . " Lucien was now eight . He thought leveling the garden and getting rid of the excess manure was a game . Minette was six ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bulbs , a sprinkling can . He went to Guillemet 's studio where he located several works from 1862 , as well as one or two later ones . Felicie had his two studies ofp333Julie : Sewing and Reading . Alfred had saved , at the bottom of a trunk , a number of sketches from Caracas . The portrait Camille had made of Piette in his Paris studio was safe in Montfoucault , as well as several of the Montfoucault countryside . Those paintings he had sold to the banker Arosa , to the opera singer Faure , to Duret , and the several canvases in Martin 's shop , which had gone unbombed , were all safe . A few of his academic drawings from the ateliers came to light , the female nude whose pubic hair got him in trouble with the massier in Francois Picot 's studio ; Julie breast-feeding Minette from 1865 . Three canvases which Julie had asked to keep for her own , Hillside ofJallais near Pontoise , one from La Varenne , a portrait of herself and Minette , had been securely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he put everything together he found there were a full ninety representative works . The years from 1857 to 1861 appeared to have vanished without a trace : pencil , ink and charcoal drawings , watercolors , beginning oils . He was frustrated not only by their being missing but by his memory of them . It was a staggering loss . The price he had paid for flight : for wanting to marry Julie in London , keep his children safe . Where could he have left his work that it would have been safe ? He mourned the irretrievable documentation of his years , the rich source of his future . But no invading force could take away the enormous amount he had learned through the concentrated labor . The near twenty years of hard-bitten experience in his craft were fully available for the future . He was only forty-one , in robust health , surrounded by a loving family , with stability in his determination . Good things were bound to emerge , better paintings than he had envisaged before . It would take resolution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canvases came to life the loss would fade and disappear . Through an advocate who was handling similar claims , Camille asked the government for ten thousand francs in damages for his missing and destroyed art work . He was paid a total of one hundred and sixty-seven dollars , barely the price of a linen handkerchief or a pair of wool socks for each missing endeavor . It was not wise to harbor bitterness . Soldiers from all nations at war looted and destroyed . Was not the Louvre filled with paintings the conquering Napoleon had taken out of Italy ? Statues , ancient and inscribed monuments , out c-I Egypt ? Fri.d &ric; Bazille 's parents grievedp334for their tall , lovable son . What sense did it make to mourn the loss of drawings and paintings ? An end to somber regret and recriminations . Creativity was in him . He would double his output . He searched out his friends , some of whom had been scattered by the war . Edouard Manet , who had become a staff officer of the National Guard , was back at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Camille the war had been a humiliation for him , that he had had to serve under Meissonier , one of the most untalented and successful copiers of the Beaux-Arts who did not know that the Fontainebleau School existed , let alone the Batignolles group . The war had not destroyed any of his property yet he was fracturing his inheritance by managing to spend more than his income . Paul Cezanne had wanted nothing to do with the war . He had spent the time at home in Aix-en-Provence painting around L'Estaque . Emile Zola had gone to Bordeaux where he had worked as a secretary to one of the government ministers . Guillaumin had continued in the Department of Bridges and Causeways . Guillemet had enlisted in the garde mobile . Renoir had been sent to a regiment of cuirassiers , then dispatched to a cavalry training center at Bordeaux . Degas had enlisted in the infantry but had been placed in the artillery because of a bad right eye . Piette had continued to work as a laborer on his farm to keep it producing . Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfred Sisley returned from England . He and his pretty , plumpjowledwife and two children still lived close by in Louveciennes . After the bankruptcy of his father he had become destitute and for the first time in his life needed to earn a living . Bazille alone had seen action . Camille accompanied Durand-Ruel , who had sold Gustave Courbet successfully for years , and Boudin , Monet 's mentor , to visit Courbet in prison . Camille was shocked to see how thin and haggard he had become , his hair turning white . Courbet embraced them in turn , tears in his eyes.  | " Look where I am lodged , " he cried , " a dark cell of dirt and vermin . I 'm allowed my meals a la pistole from the Brasserie Laveur as long as I can pay for them , but my property and paintings have been seized against a possible fine . My hemorrhoids are causing me misery . I should be in a hospital . " Camille sat on the narrow bunk ; Durand-Ruel and Boudin squatted on rickety stools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vendome torn down , " Courbet cried . " My job was to save the art work of Paris , not destroy it . " What can we do to get you transferred to a hospital ? " Camille asked . " Write to the Ministry of Justice . Get my case transferred to a civil tribunal instead of a military court . " Durand-Ruel said quietly , " You are going to need money for your defense . I hope this is not treason but if you have any hidden canvases I can ship them abroad for sale . " Courbet went into a spasm of revulsion . " I have n't painted for months ; I do n't know that I ever will again . " When it was time to leave all three were devastated . How could they help this rara avis , this genius who had been so supportive of young artists of Paris ? They could not . Gustave Courbet was tried at the end of July 1871 before a Council of War " for participation in a movement designed to change the form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other ; complicity in the destruction of a monument , the Vendome Column , by assisting those who committed the crime . " Camille and Sisley , whose homes were close to the court in Versailles , went to hear the verdict : six months in prison in addition to the three months he had already spent in jail ; and a heavy fine . They were allowed a moment to say au revoir to Courbet , now very ill , on his way out of court to be returned to prison . Toward the end of September Camille visited him in the ancient prison of Ste. Pelagie on the Rue du Puits de 1'Ermite , built in 1665 as a refuge for retired prostitutes . He was lodged in a dormitory where he had the privacy of a cubicle containing an iron bed , two tables and two chairs . He was dressed in the prison uniform of gray trousers and jacket . With an expression of disgust he described the place as " stricken by senile leprosy . " " All , my friend , Camille Pissarro , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1855 and joined my friends and me at the Brasseriep336Andler , that I would end up here ? A criminal prisoner ? " Courbet smiled winsomely . " My sister Zoe will get me transferred to a nursing home . I 'll go to Switzerland when my sentence is over . They 're threatening to make me pay the cost of casting a new column , about one hundred thousand dollars . Better men than I have fled our charming government : Voltaire , Victor Hugo . . . " " In the meanwhile is there something I can do to help ? " " Yes , a little paint and canvas . " Time went quickly as they resettled into the rehabilitated house on the Route de Versailles . When Rachel took ill he went into Paris to stay with her , taking Lucien with him , the first time Lucien had been received in the apartment . Dr. Gachet assured Camille that it was a passing attack of something with a medical name Camille had not heard before . Rachel was comforted by Dr. Gachet 's reassurance . In October he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote Julie that he yearned to return permanently . That he felt Pontoise was his home place . " I love it best . And all my own . " He would search for a house away from the two rivers on a higher , drier spot . He had a keener vision of the countryside around Louveciennes for having been away in England ; painted with a patient zest the orchards and banks of the Seine at Marly , an autumnal scene with a puffing boat and barge in the curving river , a tiny figure fishing with a bent pole , an anonymous couple walking along an equally curving path under the shedding trees toward the village beyond . He providentially gained a new and experienced collector , Ernest Hoschede , owner-manager of a department store called Gagne Petit , Save a Little , who began buying through Durand-Ruel . Hoschede was an outsized man with a large stomach and an appetite as avid for art as it was for food and merchandising profit . He had an attractive wife , Alice , buxom , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were buying other members of the painting fraternity as well , for the passionately devoted Durand-Ruel had convinced the Hoschede couple that they were buying the work of the future . Claude Monet returned to Paris and found a studio flat for his family on the Rue de l'Isly . The exquisite Leonie , who had suffered his long absence in loneliness , was his full-time model despite having a son and flat to care for . Monet had matured considerably since his flight to London and Holland . He was still the handsomest of ' all Camille'sp337painter friends ; but the derring-do had vanished . Durand-Ruel bought two more of his canvases , and he sought portrait commissions . Leonie sent a message to Julie that she would like to be with her for the accouchemen.t . Julie was delivered of their second son , whom they named Georges , in November . The Monets had been staying with them for a week . Leonie managed the cooking , her affectionate companionship a considerablelift to Julie 's spirits . Their son Jean , now four years old , played in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monet went out each day to paint in the woods of Marly , the nearby village of Voisins , on the banks of the Seine , on the road to Versailles , locating their easels close together but at different angles , learning through exploration . " It 's the light that 's important , not the object underneath it , " Monet commented . " The scene has an equal importance , " Camille said in rebuttal . " If you lose the substance , the light becomes a glow on nothing . " Alfred Pissarro too had had a second son whom he also named Georges . He met Camille at Rachel 's apartment . He had in tow a cook and a maid to install there . This done , the brothers went together for a drink at the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes on the Place Pigalle , which since the war had become the favorite cafe of the Guerbois group . It was the first time in years they had had a drink together . Alfred said happily : " Congratulations to us both . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both prospering . The French manufacturers are importuning me to export their products . Maman told me you sold two canvases to Durand-Ruel . " " Yes . He has promised to buy as my work progresses . " " You must not deny me the pleasure of buying your gold frames . Here is twenty dollars , a nativity gift from my Georges to your Georges . " He put a hand affectionately on Camille 's shoulder . " You see , Camille , I was right , we each had to make our own way . Now that you are beginning to be successful we can be friends again . " Camille forced a smile . The borderline poverty , the nagging anxietiesover the well-being of Julie and his children were not that easily eradicated . Nor was the fact that he and his family were unwanted in Alfred 's home . Yet above all he wanted peace . Emotionally he would always be yoked to his mother and brother . Julie was happy as Madame Camille Pissarro . The infant Georgesp338appeared to be in good health . Lucien @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking into the village in blue smocks , book bags slung over their shoulders . Camille had an admiring dealer , was garneringcollectors . For the first time she was beginning to believe that he could support his family by the simple act of painting pictures . In mid-November the drama of fulfillment and tragedy continued to play itself out . Paul Durand-Ruel took his wife to the opera to hear Faust . In the middle of the performance she suffered an attack brought on by her pregnancy ; subsequently she developed an inflammation of the lungs . A few days later an embolism developed . She died at two o'clock in the morning , receiving the last rites in the presence of her husband and children , the eldest of whom was only nine . It was a shocking blow to the art dealer ; his had been a harmonious marriage in which Madame Durand-Ruel was an important part of his organization . Durand-Ruel asked the elderly Aunt Louise to run the household and engaged the excellent priest of Aveyron , Abbe Fornals , to serve as tutor for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at St. Louis d'Antin , the parish of their apartment in the Rue Lafayette , where the deeply religious Durand-Ruel had made his first communion . The gathering of family and friends was a desolate one . Camille and Daubignywere the only two artists present . Durand-Ruel embraced Camille but was too overcome to speak . Yet a new bond had been wrought between them . The first day of 1872 was a pleasant one . Alfred Sisley and his two children came to dinner . Thanks to assiduity and decorative talent , more gentle and less revolutionary than his peers , Sisley was selling better than any of them . The happy day seemed a good omen for the coming year . But the fates were incorrigible . The infant Georges , now three months old , began to have seizures , his eyes turning uncontrollably , his body stiffening , the blood fleeing from his face . They were terrorstricken . Dr. Gachet applied his stethoscope to Georges 's chest , ex/amined the infant 's ears ; found the eardrums neither hot nor red . He stroked his goatee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georges 's room above the little library , then diagnosed the problem as a convulsive fever , symptom of an infection , and advised bringing in a local doctor who could be on the scene for emergencies . He prescribed an herbal potion to be administered every hour , frequentrubdowns , a teaspoon of tea . Julie and Camille were speechless . Of the five children Julie had birthed , the first had been stillborn , the fourth had died within two weeks from an infection caused by a wet nurse . Were they going to repeat Rachel 's pattern ? Camille asked himself in torment . The crisis continued . Georges 's head jerked in every direction ; at times he seemed unconscious . The local doctor prescribed egg yolk , oil and orange blossom water . The attacks were so frightening that neither Camille nor Julie was able to leave the room except to spell each other for a few hours of sleep , or to prepare Lucien and Minette for school . At the end of a month the doctor was present at a particularly violent seizure when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Camille accompanied him out to his carriage . " Doctor , if Georges is saved from death will his intelligence be lost ? " " My real fear is not for his life but that he may become an epileptic . " " Epilepsy ! What are their sins that little children are so cruelly punished ? " he cried . The doctor shook his head vigorously . " The nervous system has nothing to do with rewards and punishments . You might join your wife in prayer ; it 's at least as effective as egg yolk , oil and orange blossom water . " The seizures lessened in intensity , then ceased altogether . Georges returned to good health , his lungs were lusty , his appetite omnivorous . Camille changed trains in Paris for Auvers-sur-Oise to visit the house Gachet had bought in Auvers after his wife had borne a daughter and developed lung trouble . He wanted to present the doctor with two new canvases : Sunrise and Snow Effect at Louveciennes . He followed I ) r . Gachet up the stairs of the three-story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years been a convent and was as bizarre as Cachet 's tunic , fitted at the waist , flaring to mid-thigh , with embroidered stand-up collar , epaulettes , a wide belt and gold buttons closely spaced horn the neck down . the house was located in chaoticp340terrain , wild and picturesque . Twenty steep stone steps led to the first level of the whitish cube pierced by nine bays , topped by four different levels of roof . Under a window of the third floor was a securely nailed sign which read : BOARDING SCHOOL FOR YOUNG GIRLSGachet led Camille to a studio under the eaves where he had installedan etching press on which he made mezzotints and engravings . He had tried to paint but , as he himself admitted , after a lot of the best young painters had tried to instruct him : " I am unteachable . " But not in medicine . During the Franco-Prussian War he had pioneeredthe use of antiseptic solutions which had earned him praise from the medical profession , and patients who could pay in a harder currency than works of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easels as Camille explained they were a gift for always coming when summoned , for diagnosing the ills of the family and treating them with homeopathic potions until they were well again . Dr. Gachet stepped back from the paintings and promptly went into a frenzy of joy , waving his arms , rolling his eyes , dancing about the easels as he poured out a torrent of exultation and praise . " Sacrebleu ! " Camille cried to himself . " He 's going to have a seizure . " Exhausted , Dr. Gachet sank into a canvas-backed chair , took off his fur hat and wiped the perspiration from his brow . " Ah , no , it is too much . They are worth many times my visits . I want the two paintings , oh yes , they will enrich my life ; but I must pay you something in addition . " " Please accept , my dear Doctor . It will make me easy in my mind . " The two men embraced . The recovery of his son sent Camille out into the countryside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roads of Louveciennes , snow studies , the horse chestnut trees , the village of Voisins , the woods . He did not find the area as rich in motif as the Hermitage and Pontoise , yet there were marvelously paintable scenes close at hand . He developed his sense of what he called spatial construction , reorganized the architecture of his themes , left out the rigid borders on the top , bottom and sides used by his antecedents . He eliminated black from his palette ; studied the luminous colors of shadowsthrown by trees across a road ; painted the simple truths he per/ceived of the earth and its living creatures . He was painting on goodsizedcanvases : the Seine at Marly , seventeen by twenty-three inches ; chestnut trees of Louveciennes , sixteen by twenty-one ; others twentyfourby twenty-nine , filling the space with light and shadow , using light to define form , leaving no area void . He used cream white , light brown and nature 's variety of greens , a range of brush strokes to achieve diversity . He sought a balance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes performed the function of instruments in a dissection laboratory . This done , he put the pieces together into an organic whole , assimilating the sometimes conflicting aspects of nature into his own temperament . When he went out into the terrain with Monet or Sisley they taught each other how to reproduce on canvas the colors of nature , to keep intensity by the adroit mixing of pigments ; to apply color in little strokes and patches to suggest depth . How to create meaning without spelling out detail ; to portray the poetry of humble things . How to be austere , skillful , true to the spirit of the world and to one 's own . They caught reflections of the winter and the luminous colors of shadows which painters had hitherto neglected . On days of impossible weather he painted his favorite model , his winsome seven-year-old daughter . Minette adored sitting for her father ; it proved that he loved her and was fascinated by her . First in school clothes , the blue smock over a red dress and red socks , a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intertwined in front of her . Next he painted her dressed in her pink and white striped cotton , her straw hat showing a fringed blue ribbon , holding a colorful bunch of her mother 's flowers in her lap . Her face was a fine mating of her parents : Julie 's regular features , broad-cheeked peasant face , dominated by Camille 's large , warm brown eyes . For an artist who was not interested in portraiture , his paintings of Minette , with her long brown hair combed down over her shoulders , were sentimentally truthful . Julie said without inflection : " Minette is Papa 's girl . You understand each other without putting commas and periods in your sentences . " Julie would not pose , though she did not object to his sketching her as she moved about her chores in the house or in her garden patches . Lucien could not sit in one place for more than a couple of minutes except for the daily drawing ; lesson from his father.  |p342Durand-Ruel  was buying one picture a month from Camille , Monet and Sisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Degas and Renoir into the Durand-Ruel gallery , with several of their latest canvases . Durand-Ruel , who turned down a half dozen conventionalpainters a day , fell in love with Renoir 's The Pont Neuf buying it for enough money to enable Renoir to rent the very first studio of his own , on the Rue St. Georges . From Degas , who had never sold anything , he purchased The Orchestra of the Opera and The Banker . He told Camille : " That was a fine thing you did , bringing in your two friends because you thought they were good enough for me to buy . It cuts down on the amount of money I have for your work and Monet 's . Like Rousseau with Millet , it 's an act of brotherhood . Another reason I believe your little group will not sink into the sea like thousands of painters in Paris today . " " We must all arrive together . " " So it seems . " Durand-Ruel lit one of his aromatic cigars . It was a good time for Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Autumn , Winter , for the library of his St. Cloud home ; his brother Achille acquired an English landscape . Faure bought another Louveciennes painting and Ernest Hoschede continued to buy from Durand-Ruel . The Beaux-Arts Salon was resumed in the spring of 1872 . Camille , Monet , Sisley and Degas decided not to submit to its judging process again . " Why should we ? " Monet demanded . " We 're selling outside the Salon . " Berthe Morisot , Manet , Cezanne and Renoir disagreed . All four submitted canvases . Renoir and Cezanne were summarily rejected . Morisot 's brilliant study of a mother and child , painted in unorthodox colors , was accepted , as was Manet 's Combat of the Kearsarge and the Alabama . Neither picture sold . Manet , eager to sell something , placed two of his canvases in the studio of a friend , Alfred Stevens , a Belgian who had achieved considerable success in Paris by painting society girls in opulent interiors . Stevens had a wide circle of wealthy friends ; Manet was hoping that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Durand-Ruel . Camille learned about it while sitting with friends at the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes , where they now gathered . Durand-Ruel , paying a social visit to Alfred Stevens 's soigne studio , saw two of Edouardp343Manet 's paintings , was enchanted and bought them within the hour . He asked Stevens to take him to visit Manet 's studio the following day , never having met the man , and was so moved that he bought all twenty-three canvases on the walls , easels and floor , for seven thousand dollars ; the first time a body of work of one of their group had been purchased as a whole ; and the highest price paid . The painters were exultant . When Camille took his next two paintings into Durand-Ruel 's for his monthly sale , the dealer exclaimed : " I marvel at my purchase ; one does n't appreciate a work of art until one possesses it and lives with it . Luncheon on the Grass , Olympia , The Balcony , The Guitarist appear even more beautiful to me now that I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned to Manet 's and bought a second lot that he had rounded up from various places . " He placed Camille 's paintings on his office easels . " Any collector wanting to acquire a Daubigny has to come to me . I have kept his prices high and steady . The same will apply to Edouard Manet . I am mounting a show for my London gallery ; I will hang eleven of Manet 's canvases , seven of yours , four of Sisley 's , several of Claude Monet 's . This exhibition should accomplish with the English collectors what I could not achieve during the war . Once I begin selling your group in Paris and London , I will buy your entire output also . Early on my father and I were regarded as a Fontainebleau gallery ; now we will become known as a Batignolles gallery . " When Camille asked offhandedly why Alfred Sisley was selling better than he was , Durand-Ruel replied : " He paints almost as well as you and Monet . But his canvases are easier to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred days straight , drawing at his studio table far into the night , too elated by Durand-Ruel 's support to give serious consideration to eating or sleep . Julie put food in front of him , enticed him into bed around midnight . He was grateful for her solicitudebut rolled and pitched like a small cargo boat in a storm at sea . horn his sketches he did harshly beautiful end-of-winter scenes of rain and cold , ice-cold blue and white streaks amidst barren trees . He did still fifes of Julie 's emerging peonies , the surrounding farmlands sprouting bright green shoots from the chocolate-colored furrows . And he became painted out.  |p344Exhausted  . Stripped of energy and ideas . By reflex he went onpainting . He took half a dozen of the canvases into Durand-Ruel . " Ah , Pissarro , you have a batch of new work . Come , put it on thestands . " The dealer became silent ; pockets of disappointment forming at the corners of his mouth . " These are n't of first quality , " he declared . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . Yet I thought I should continue . . . . " " No . Only when you are at the top of your form . " " I 'll manage to get a few sous for them . " " I would n't recommend that . You want to be represented only by your best . " He stayed at his mother 's apartment that night . He had an appointment with a dealer called Latouche for the next morning . He wrote to Julie , sending her a thousand kisses , telling her of his scene with Durand-Ruel ; he did not try to hide the barking of his shins . Latouche had a narrow store-front gallery . He bought a picture of a farm for ten dollars . Camille knew that Durand-Ruel 's admonition was in season ; but he could not bring himself to go home to Julie emptyhanded . He and Lucien gathered bundles of branches from the woods to feed their fireplaces . Though he wrote to Dr. Gachet that the family was afflicted with frightful colds and Louveciennes was no better for the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their work schedule . Lucien and Minette attended school , Julie cared for Georges , her house , vegetables and flowers . Camille painted a poetic Entrance to the Village of Voisins . Julie was kept content with visits from her sisters , Felicie and her daughter Nini , and Josephine , who had married a Monsieur Daudon and moved to Paris . She had a son Jules and daughter Marie . Camille too had company . Armand Guillaumin came as often as he could get away from his job and on weekends . " I know I 'm not good yet , " he confided to Camille . " That 's becausep345I have to work full time . But I 'm learning from you . As soon as I win my lottery I 'll be able to retire and paint seven days a week . " Claude Monet , Leonie and their son came from Argenteuil where they had found a modest house . Renoir came from his parents ' cottage to share a day of painting . Even Degas , who disliked the countryside , visited , buying one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve changing color in plein air . Degas laughed . " The first time I saw you at a party in that gaucho outfit , those long white pantaloons and voluminous poncho , you looked like a Sephardic rabbi . " Piette and Adele visited , bringing with them jams and cheeses from Montfoucault . Because so many painters were now coming to Louveciennes , some of them obviously prosperous , the hostility of the townspeople was slowly eroded . By July he had painted twenty complete oils , oils Durand-Ruel would not be able to fault . " I 've exhausted my interest in painting this region , " he said to Julie one day . Julie asked : " What does that mean for the children and me ? " " That we all move . " " Where to ? " " Back to Pontoise . The Hermitage . " " Back there again ? " " Yes . I barely scratched the surface . " Dr. Gachet , close by in Auvers , found them a house in Pontoise . When they went to see it they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunken , inconvenient . They stayed overnight in a hotel by the Oise docks . The following day they located a small house on Rue Malbranche . It was n't cheerful , but it was clean and roomy , and would be dry . Camille took a three-month lease ; resolved to find something on higher ground , above the river mists . On the last day of July he helped a brawny driver load their furniture into a two-horse farm wagon . It was a full day 's haul , starting at daybreak , using winding country roads northward through St. Germain , avoiding the Paris outskirts . Camille rode with the wagoner , protecting his packets of paintings . They made no attempt to adorn the house , treating it as a campsite . Once installed , Julie and the children took pleasure in the big marketp346fairs , parades on holidays , communal parks where she could sit on a bench crocheting while Georges slept in his carriage and Lucien and Minette played with other town children on the greensward . The childrenwere back in the Pontoise school . Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he had to walk and wander , familiarize himself with the vicinity . The Hermitage had not been important enough to be bombarded during the war ; little if anything had changed . The peasants of the surroundingfarms knew him by sight ; the townspeople were accustomed to seeing him roam the hilly winding streets with a rucksack or easel on his back . They gave no appreciable sign of welcome , neither was he the stranger who incited suspicion by the oddity of his vocation . They acted as though he had never been away ; after a few days of painting in the neighborhood he felt the same way . Time was seamless . The days merged smoothly into each other as he put in long hours painting the areas that moved him so deeply , the quai at Pothuis , the streets in Pontoise , the Oise and setting sun . It was not a time without struggle and fatigue , but it was fruitful , as though his power and vision had come into focus . Rachel became ill again during the summer of 1872 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit her . His wife Marie did not consider it part of her matrimonial duty to nurse a sick mother-in-law . Camille could go to Paris only rarely despite her frequent emergency notes . Julie would come searching for him with the urgent messages ; he would drop everything and take the next train into Paris . He decided that the moment of truth had arrived . He could not keep rushing to Paris to comfort his mother . Neither could he continue to tolerate his mother 's ignoring of his wife . He found her propped up in bed in a robe , a book open on the blanket . Her hair was neatly combed but her skin was pale and her eyes brooding . " This summoning me is going to stop . " Tears came into Rachel 's eyes . " You are going to abandon me . " " No . I 'm going to take you home with me to Pontoise . Julie will take care of you . So will I , when my day 's work is done . " " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have seen the last of me. "  |p347She  sprang to attention . " You will join my family or you will have precious little family to join . " Rachel studied her son 's face , feature by feature , as though it were a freshly plastered brick wall that she had to pass through . " At least you 're married now . You 're making a living . That 's respect-able . " " We have a bedroom for you . The country air will do you good . " Rachel felt the steel in him . " I will come . . . until I am well . " " Stay as long as you like . " She dressed , packed a small bag . Riding out on the train they were silent . Julie and Rachel had not seen each other since Julie had walked out of the Passy apartment almost fourteen years before . Both were ill at ease . Julie bade her mother-in-law a polite welcome , took her valise up to the bedroom in which she had put vases of flowers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new pink bedspread to match his painting of pink peonies . She helped her unpack . As she closed the door of the room behind her , she murmured : " Grace a Dieu . Now we are unis comme les doigts de la main . " But Rachel had come under protest , under an ultimatum ; she was not going to give in easily . " Your house is bare . . . . You boil the vegetables too much . . . . You are too indulgent with the children . . . . You live like peasants . " " What to do ? " Julie asked Camille in the privacy of their bedroom . She was near tears . " She talks to me as though I were still a bonne , except that when I was a bonne she treated me with respect . " Camille was disturbed by his mother 's irascibility . " It 's her protest that I did n't marry a woman with a townhouse in Paris . " Rachel left at the end of five days . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In September Paul Cezanne came with Hortense Fiquet and Paul , Jr. , who had been born on January 4 of that year , his birth registered at the mairie , with Cezanne setting down his name as the father , just as his own had been set down thirty-three years before . " If ' my father found out he would cut off my allowance and we 'd starve , " he told them.  |p348Camille  alone among the Batignolles painters believed that Cezanne possessed a unique talent . He had not quieted during the years since his thorny nature had made him a virtual outcast at the Cafe Guerbois . He appeared to bristle even in repose . His head was set defensively into his shoulders as though to secure him from attack . His rounded black beard was as ferocious as his hostile dark eyes . Nine-year-old Lucien observed him with a neophyte painter 's eye : " He wears a visored cap , his hair is long , black and straggly at back and he is bald in front . He walks with a long pikestaff which frightens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even docile . " We 're country people together , " he said fondly . " That 's one reasonI asked if we could come visit you . You 're like my sainted mother and sister Marie . " He pecked her on the cheek . Julie saw beneath Cezanne 's protective skin , saw his fierce hunger for affection . " I dislike Paris ; it 's too crowded and agitated . I 'd like to go back to Aix for a spell of painting in that dazzling clear air . But I do n't dare take Hortense and the boy with me . " Paul Cezanne 's affection for his son was more publicly displayed than his affection for Hortense . Julie enjoyed having Hortense Fiquet with her . Hortense had a rather phlegmatic face , with a prominent nose and brow , a small mouth and outsized chin , a smooth complexion without coloring and a thick mop of jet-black hair wrapped in a bun high in the back like the raised head of a cobra . She had been born in the small village of Saligneil but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . Her father was a bank clerk ; he had taught her to read . She was addicted to romantic novels ; had earned a living sewing handmadebooks , was dowerless . She said she had met Cezanne while earning extra money as a model , a claim Cezanne never confirmed . It was a relationship they had fallen into by propinquity : Cezanne was not likely to have gone courting ; Hortense appeared too stolid to attract passersby . She was stoical by nature , enabling her to endure Cezanne 's outbursts , tirades against the way of the world , spouts of seething anger whose cause she could not determine . Hortense asked Julie , " Do you know why they paint ? " " No . Do you ? " " They 're driven . By what ? " " I do n't know . Do you ? "  | " No , " Hortense replied . " Neither do they . But there 's no help for them . They chose to live with their paints , we chose to live with them . We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to persuade Cezanne to paint directly from nature . He knew better than to tell him what to do ; but if they painted side by side for a time his resistance might falter . " Paul , let 's pack our easels and paint at the Hermitage tomorrow . " " You know I do n't paint out of doors . I sketch , then go back to my studio and work under controlled light . " " Why not do an entire canvas en plan air ? It would be exciting for both of us . We could compare values as the day moves and the light changes . " Cezanne finally gave in . When they set up their canvases just a few feet from each other , in the corner of a downhill road populated with houses hanging to its sides , Camille saw that Cezanne was painting in black , brown and heavy impastos , savagely using his palette knife instead of a brush . He puzzled over how best to handle his friend . " Paul , look at my canvas . It 's all delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting this sun-splashed scene of vivid colors the way you did The Autopsy and Murder . There are no corpses around here , only copses . You 're painting your inner mood instead of the brilliant outer mood you 're gazing at . " Cezanne started to be angry , to argue , then realized that Camille had nothing to gain by his suggestions . " You 're right , " he growled , " but I would n't take it from anyone else . Show me how you mix your colors without muddying them with emo-tion . " A peasant came behind them , watched them at work , then commented , pointing to Camille , " You dab , " and to Cezanne , " You smear . " The men looked grim , then laughed . " He has more perception than the critics on the Parisian journals , " Cezanne commented . They painted side by side every day for several weeks , the Cezanne family having moved to a hotel across the bridge over the Oise . Cezannecompleted a couple of oils , said to Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been my happiest time since I roamed the fields of Provencewith Emile Zola . What 's more , I 'm not going to destroy these oils I 've done with you . "  |  " Why should you ? They 're beginning to glow . " " I 've destroyed half and more of my canvases . I hated them . " One day Camille walked Cezanne along the four-mile towpath to Auvers to introduce him to Dr. Gachet and the tranquillity of the thatched-roofed village overlooking the Oise . When Cezanne told him that he would like to live in Auvers , Dr. Gachet found him a home to rent . When Cezanne next walked the towpath to visit with Julie and paint with Camille , he said in an awed tone : " Would you believe it ? Dr. Gachet loves my painting . He actually paid money for two of my latest pictures . " He turned to Julie with an expression she had not seen on his face before : " I never believed it would happen , but if I have a master , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Julie exclaimed , " My Camille 's a humble workman like the rest of you , painting your lives away . " " Do n't be deceived , my good Julie , " Cezanne replied . " Your Camillehas the talent of a master . " Camille went into Paris to see Durand-Ruel . Cezanne was to join him there . He received a note instead : I take up Lucien 's pen , at an hour when the railway should be transporting me to my penates . It 's to tell you in a roundaboutway that I missed the train . . . . Useless to add that I 'm your guest till tomorrow . Well then , Madame Pissarro asks you to bring back from Paris some Nestle 's Milk Powder for little Georges , also Lucien 's shirts from his aunt Felicie 's . Good evening , Paul CezanneToward the end of 1872 , by which time Durand-Ruel had purchased close to a dozen of his paintings , Camille walked into the large gallery and began as always to study the dazzling display of venerable masters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the vigorousp351group of Fontainebleau painters . He was surprised to find that only one of his own oils was on the gallery wall . " Where are the rest of my canvases ? " he asked . " In the storeroom ? " Durand-Ruel glanced away . When he turned back he had made a decision . " Many of them are in the apartment of a Monsieur Edwards , a Levantine banker . " " He could n't have bought all of them ? " " Sit down , my friend . Light your pipe . It 's a dealer 's maneuver . I feel I can trust you . " Camille puffed on his pipe in puzzlement . " Mon ami , have you ever wondered where all the money comes from to buy pictures from your group , pictures that do n't sell ? " " No , monsieur . That is your private affair . " " Alors ! Last year I made the acquaintance of a bronzemaker , Monsieurde Marinac , who inspired confidence in me . I told him of my wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had undertaken to keep the superb works I had without being pressed to sell them . He introduced me to the foreign banker Edwards , who had made a great fortune in Constantinople and who agreed to make me the advances according to my needs . I guaranteed him a sufficient number of canvasesfrom the group I represent to cover his advances . Since he has a spacious apartment on the Boulevard Haussmann , it was decided that the pictures would hang in his salon where it would look as though he had purchased them . At a given moment I would hold a public sale under his name . That kind of sale always succeeds best because of the great suspicion about dealers . Many of my Fontainebleau canvases are hung in his apartment as well . The auction will be a slight deception on my part , but no one will be cheated . " Camille chewed on his pipestem . " When will you hold this auction in Monsieur Edwards 's apart-ment ? " " In a year or two . As soon as we have been able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sale your positions will be secure and your prices high . " Camille felt vaguely uncomfortable , but then he was not a businessman . " For all that time our pictures will not be seen in your gallery ? " " Oh yes , one or two of each of you . And you are of course free to sellp352to private collectors . I can see that you are disturbed . Please do n't be . The situation is not unique . " There was only one statement Camille could make to this man who had been so kind to him . " I have implicit confidence in your judgment . " The young artist who lived across the hall from Rachel became a frequent visitor to Pontoise . His greatest joy was painting alongside Camille . Camille liked Edouard Beliard 's enthusiasm , though he was not learning much of anything . " No matter , " declared Julie ; " he 's good with the children . Like a young uncle . " Two more painters , Victor Vignon and Frederic Cordey , settled in Pontoise . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his flow of visitors from Paris and the nearby villages , Camille 's return to Pontoise had spawned a burgeoning art colony . Ignored by painters for centuries , Pontoise and its surrounding countrysidewas becoming a favorite hunting ground for motifs to be painted in a new idiom . Julie welcomed them all , offered warmth and the fruits of her garden . It was on a visit to Paris that Camille wrote a hurried note to Emile Zola , who was expecting him for dinner : " Dear Zola , My wife asks Madame Zola to take the mother rabbit that we have for her . To hurry as she wo n't be long in having babies . If Madame Zola could come to Pontoise , it would make us very happy , and at the same time she could arrange with my wife to take the young mother rabbit . " I had intended to come by your place today but I am forced to leave this morning . " The following Sunday Emile Zola and his wife Alexandrine came on the morning train to collect their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being together , which frustrated Zola , though only thirty-two , because , like Camille , he wanted a large family . As he and Zola started out for a walk Alexandrine , who had been converted by marriage from a pretty girl to a beautiful woman , warned Camille : " My husband has the habit of lecturing people on how to conduct their lives . But he never follows his own dicta . " Zola had defended Edouard Manet 's work in a brilliant monograph which had brought neither him nor Manet any credit . He had abandonedthe marginal life of the bohemian Left Bank for the respectabilityof the Rue de la Condamine in Montmartre . It was a modestlyp353genteel house but no matter what long hours he worked at his desk there was rarely enough income from the journals to take care of himself , his wife and mother . At one point the furniture was repossessedbecause he could not meet the payments . At another , his mother had to take the down out of their mattresses and pawn it for money to buy bread . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a woman of growing strength and character , because she wanted to keep Zola happy ; his mother because she was grateful for not being abandoned . By now Zola was deep in his third volume for a series of Rougon-Macquart novels . He was possessed by his work ; some said he was a prisoner of his own planning . " The publisher , Lacroix , has contracted to pay me one hundred dollars a month for five years . I 'm going to bring Dr. Claude Bernard 's determinism ' to life . And I 'm following Taine , the English philosopher , into science and naturalism . Vice and virtue are chemical productslike sugar and vitriol . ' Lamarck and Darwin have it exactly right : everything is inherited . " The fall forest was beginning to change its face from green to rosepurple . " Forgive me , Zola , but what has this to do with literature ? " " That 's what my plots are based upon , the natural and social history of the legitimate descendants of the Rougons ; the illegitimate offspringof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Empire . It is a vast edifice but I have found the design and shall build it block by block . Balzac and Flaubert are my masters . " Zola was also at work on his ninth volume of published prose , at the same time he was turning Therese Raquin into a play and writing articles for the journal Corsaire . " But I am being brutalized by hackwork . My body aches . I go to bed every night groaning with pain . Every night I am frightened that I will die before morning . " Camille said with a wry grin : " Zola , you know the old saw : Qui mouche trop son nez en tire du sang . Who blows his nose too much draws blood . " Then he realized that the aphorism applied to himself as well . He received a message from Claude Monet in Argenteuil asking if he could come to Pontoise for an " urgent purpose . " Monet , thirty-two , had the strong regular features of an idol of the Comedic Francaise , cheeks of high color , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair combed forward over the brow , one of the most neatly barbered , most attractive beards to be seen on the Parisian boulevards . He also had had the most excruciating time managing to eat and buy paint , for although he had been able to wheedle a few dollars out of his father and Aunt Sophie in Le Havre , he was by nature so childishly improvident that he became known as " unfortunate Monet . " If he had enough money to feed his family for the first half of the week he bought art supplies and threw himself into his painting with a wild fervor , unmindful of the fact that they would be without bread for the second half and he would be reduced once again to sending out pathetically begging letters to everyone he knew . Leonie grew ever more beautiful , with a superb willowy figure and the face of Helen of Troy " that launched a thousand ships . " Those who mistrusted Monet claimed that he had seduced her out of lust and married her for the dowry her parents then maneuvered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still adored him with the singlemindeddevotion that should have been accorded to a saint , continuing to pose for him in her now aging gowns for endless hours every day , grateful for any kind word he might afford her . Monet treated her with a touch of condescension . Camille knew all of Claude Monet 's weaknesses . As an artist he was nothing of the philosopher , had little intellector penetrating knowledge of the world about him , the one he was painting so gloriously . Camille told Julie , " From the viewpoint of natural talent he outstrips us all . " Cezanne exclaimed , seeing Monet 's newest canvases : " He is only an eye . But , my God , what an eye ! " After supper of rabbit stew , at dusk , Monet asked Camille if they could have a pipe by the fireplace in the living room . When the men had packed their bowls from Camille 's tobacco jar and lighted them with a wooden ember from the fireplace , Monet began earnestly : " Do you recall a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shared a studio with Frederic Bazille ? " Camille remembered the raucous celebration there . " Then you will recall Bazille 's suggestion that we form a society that would resemble in miniature Proudhon 's concept of a mutualist ' associationand hold our own exhibitions free of governmental and BeauxArtsregulations and prejudices . " " None of us wanted it , " said Camille . " We were struggling to be/come Salon favorites on the road to acceptance . We had even failed to raise the funds to use Courbet 's pavilion . " " Bazille insisted that the Salon would continue to reject us or keep us in inferior positions as long as they were in control . " " He was right . " Monet hitched his chair closer to Camille 's , said with a radiant ex-pression : " The war precluded any Salon in 1871 . In 1872 the new minister for the Salon was more conservative than Comte de Nieuwerkerke had ever been . Few if any of us will submit pictures or be accepted for the 1873 Salon . Instead of being the Rejected Ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect now ? " Camille wrinkled his forehead . " An exhibition of Batignolles Independents ? " " Precisely . " Camille rose , went to the window , collected his thoughts . While it was true that he had shown in seven separate Salons , he had been disrespectfully hung , had been there by the grace of Daubigny , had had an R stamped on his pictures three times . Realistically he agreed that the new republican jury would reject them as easily as had NapoleonIII 's . He also knew that if they formed an independent exhibition they would be discriminated against by the Salon forever . But none of them would get very far anyway with the self-perpetuating , **25;13593;TOOLONG . He turned back to Monet resolutely . " The time does seem to have come . We are selling to Durand-Ruel . We have a few ardent collectors . We can afford to rent space . DurandRuelwill back our exhibition because it will help spread our names and work . How do we begin ? " " We already have . Just now . We 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure we can convince the rest . " Camille was not that certain . " There will be dissenters . Fearful ones . We have to be sure we 're on solid ground . I 'll search in Pontoise for a cooperative society whose rules of agreement we might use as a base . " Monet was jubilant . He sprang up , clapped Camille on the shoulder . " Excellent ! That 's why I came to you first . You are older . You havethe solidity of character . Now is the time . Prenons la lune avec les dents . " Camille laughed low in his chest . " Take the moon in our teeth ? Iwonder if it 's digestible ? It looks like hard yellow rock from here . " Monet raised his eloquent eyebrows , asking , " What is n't ? "  |p356Camille  quickly gained the cooperation of Paul Cezanne and Armand Guillaumin . He met Alfred Sisley in Durand-Ruel 's and gained his consent . Durand-Ruel himself was enthusiastic . " I like the idea , " he exclaimed with the usual fervor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet makes sense . Such an exhibitionwill consolidate you as a school . You can count on me . It 's all to the good . " Degas , when he returned from New Orleans in the United States where he had been visiting his uncle 's family , entered wholeheartedly and worked on two capable and recognized painters , Lepic and Levert , to join them . Monet had difficulty bringing in his friend Renoir , who was painting with him in Argenteuil , until Camille promised him a position on the management committee . Monet also converted Boudin . Piette wrote from Montfoucault : " . . . If a certain nucleus of paintersplan not to exhibit at all in the Salon of 1873 , and the jury is still composed of reactionaries , I also would join with pleasure . " The first serious opposition came at a meeting in Edouard Manet 's studio . Manet , with a grim expression on his face , told the small assem-blage : " You can not fly in the face of the Salon . They are the only road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw yourself into the main arena . I will never exhibit in a place next door . It 's respectability that counts . " " Manet , " Camille started in a conciliatory tone . " We have all learned from you , from your talent and courage . You scandalized Paris with your magnificent Luncheon on the Grass and Olympia . Almost singlehandedlyyou shocked the public into the modern world . Surely you would n't abandon us now ? " " Certainly not ! " Manet 's manner was acerbic . " It is you who are abandoning me . On a foolhardy venture . You will be laughed out of your underdrawers . Do you consider we were manhandled at the Salon des Refuses ? Such an independent exhibition as this will be treated a hundred times more brutally . You will suffer . "  | " We 're suffering now , " said Renoir . " What have we got to lose ? " " The future . " With which he terminated the meeting . It was obvious that no one could turn him around . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pontoise . Guillemet had been traveling . He had written to Camille occasionally , reaffirming their friendship and his interest in Camille 's work , but was himself painting in the same mannerCamille had perceived fifteen years before in La Roche-Guyon where they had first met . Guillemet launched into the purpose of his visit . " I heard in Paris that you wanted to see me and invite me to join your society . " He sat down on the sofa , pulled up his beautifully tailored trousers so they would not stretch at the knees . He had grown into an imposing figure , tall , broad , with a tanned complexion , debonair light brown mustache . " Pissarro , you were my first friend among the artists . You introduced me to the Guerbois . . . Camille stood silent ; these compliments forbode no good. " . . . that 's why I felt I owed you a personal explanation , one I did not want to make at your next meeting . I ca n't join your movement . I think it unwise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's flouting authority , it 's against the proprieties . . . . Against the establishment . " " It 's not against anything . It 's for ourselves , " Camille retorted . Guillemet was unhappy about the encounter but by the purple flush mounting toward his eyes Camille could see that he was determined . " Pissarro , I urge you not to go forward . Edouard Manet is right . The public is not ready for your kind of work . Stay with the Salon . Slowly you 'll earn medals , commissions , sales . That 's what painting is about . " Camille did not wish to argue the point . He was saddened at the loss of Antoine Guillemet and was shocked the following week to hear that Corot , upon learning of Guillemet 's decision , had said : " My dear Antoine , you have done very well to escape from that gang . " Why were they a gang , he and Monet , Sisley , Degas , Renoir , Cezanne , Boudin , Bracquemond . . . ? They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve a new color , brushwork , the light of reality and beauty combined . What had happened to the mind of t he great Corot that he could dismiss contemptuously not onlyp358an idea but a whole segment of conscientious artists ? Had not he and the Fontainebleau School also been revolutionaries ? Did every man freeze his own revolution ? Berthe Morisot had asked if he would come to luncheon the next time he was in Paris . A garcon in a red-striped vest led him out to her studio built at the rear of a spacious garden behind the family town house . She received him graciously ; they had been acquaintances rather than friends since there had appeared no occasion for friendship . Berthe had a long country smock over her daytime silk dress . He again realized how handsome the thirty-one-year old woman was , tall , with a fine figure , a long dark braid on either side of her head , penetratingeyes . In Manet 's group portrait , The Balcony , she had looked a little old and hard , but in In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving , as she was seated on the richly covered divan . On her easel was a glorious canvas of a mother and child on a balcony overlooking the Seine and a view of Paris . Another canvas on an easel nearby was the quai at Lorient , " as exquisite in tone and light as anything the rest of us ever painted , " Camille decided . A third oil , of a cradle , a mother fondly watching her infant sleep , was drying in a corner . Morisot 's delicate touch was unsurpassed . " Monsieur Pissarro , I heard of the society you and Monet are formingfor an exhibition . " " Yes , mademoiselle . We were hoping that you would join us . " A maid in a white apron and cap summoned them to the table . " I most certainly shall , " Berthe Morisot said when they were seated . " I think it is a splendid idea . Let us show together . Then the public will see what we are striving to accomplish . I asked you to come here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped for a moment . It was an awkward situation . No one doubted that she was deeply in love with Edouard Manet , whom she considered her master and dearest friend , though she was unhappy about his affair with Eva Gonzales . Did she know how vehemently Manet had opposed their movement ? Should he tell her ? " Edouard Manet has informed me that he thinks you are all very wrong . He went over every one of his objections . They do n't convince me . I feel that he is the one who is wrong . I told him so . Please be assured , Monsieur Pissarro , that I am my own woman . Edouard Manet can teach me painting but he can not influence my conduct . " Camille recounted what had emerged so far , for each member of the Batignolles group was an individualist with strong opinions . Theyp359would need about thirty to pay their costs ; only respected professionalswould be invited . The Morisot dining room was furnished with inlaid gold Louis XIV furniture . They were joined by Edouard Manet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man more conservatively dressed than Edouard , and less dogmatic in manner . Camille gathered that he had shrewdly invested his share of the Manet fortune when his father died . He and Berthe Morisot were good friends . He had obviouslygraced this elegant room before . On his way back to Pontoise , gazing absently out the window at the wintry landscape , Camille mused fleetingly : " Her high social position will do us good . She is also by all odds the best woman painter in Paris today . In the years to come she will surpass Rosa Bonheur in public acclaim . " His occasional meetings with his confreres did not cut into his work schedule ; rather the concept of a cooperative exhibition stimulated him to greater effort . In the final five months of 1872 , since he had returned to his beloved Pontoise , he had completed forty-seven works , almost all of them oils , a formidable accomplishment . His portraits of Minette , and still lifes done during inclement weather , had gratifying inner harmonies . He completed the screen for Achille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth as it turned on its axis . Arosa paid him one hundred dollars . He also painted snow effects , a thaw , a fair in Pontoise , views of the Seine , the docks , roads at the side of cultivated fields , houses in the woods . It was a period of intense fulfillment . The beauty and penetration of the canvases were attested by everyone , his dealers , the collectors , the painters who came to visit or saw the work he took into Paris . Theodore Duret told him : " Pissarro , there is something of godlike tranquillity in your paintings . No matter how distressed I may be , when I gaze at your beautifullyattuned Fair at St. Martin or Road Across the Fields , I feel a sense of peace . I maintain that rustic nature with animals is what suits your talent best . You have n't Sisley 's decorative quality , nor Monet 's fantasticeye , but you have an intuitive and profound feeling for nature and a powerful brush , with the result that a picture by you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courage to continue at this breakneck pace , " Camille responded . " You do n't need more courage . All you need is canvas , stretchersp360and oil paint . I know those tubes of color are expensive . I 'll send you a check each month until I have paid off the paintings I 've purchased . " Piette and Adele came for a visit . Each day Camille watched Piette 's palette lightening in color , his brush strokes becoming shorter . Adele was happiest when playing with the children . She was isolated from the women of Montfoucault as Julie was in Pontoise ; their laughter animatedtheir conversation , making them feel alive in a manner they could not attain alone , Adele in Montfoucault , Julie with Camille 's visiting artists who argued about art theories . Camille was surprised to learn that Piette now opposed the cooperativeeffort . Not on the ground of harming themselves with the BeauxArts , but a distrust of artists to follow through , to remain with the organization . The recruiting for an exhibition of independents continued , but after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to participate . " I ca n't afford dues . . . . " " I wo n't have pictures ready . . . . " " I 'm going to show in Bordeaux . " Few would admit that they were unwilling to join such a radical departure for fear of its consequences ; or , more simply , they had no faith that anything could be sold out of such an unorthodox showing . Who would pay money for pictures that did not have any official stamp on them to make their investment safe ? Durand-Ruel remained steadfast . He told them to advance without worrying about the dissenters , that the Batignolles ' points of departureseemed to the conservative Beaux-Arts as dangerous as a putative uprising with political implications . But art must be a living organism ; change was essential . Camille 's struggle with his own fellows came when he attempted to get Armand Guillaumin and Paul Cezanne accepted . When he proposedGuillaumin 's name at a meeting at the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes , he could get no one to approve . Rejection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenuous connection would be a severe blow to him , already feeling inferior to the other members because he had little education , worked as a government clerk and had laboring-class origins . Camille got to his feet , the better to communicatehis feelings . " I beg of you , do n't do this to Guillaumin . It would be a public humiliation . He has trouble enough , unable to paint except on Sundaysand holidays , with barely enough salary to buy supplies . "  | " Pissarro , his work simply is not good enough , " said Degas . " He would lower the standard of our exhibition . " " He 's making progress . By the time we open he will have a couple of good canvases of workmen along the Seine . Our group was not formed to brand an R on anyone 's forehead . Not a longtime associate cer-tainly . " All eyes turned to Degas , who shrugged assent . " With your guarantee , we 'll accept him . But you 're going to have to conduct a one-man atelier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with Paul Cezanne . There were two counts against Cezanne : he not only painted wildly , which would bring further derision upon them ; but his abrasive personality had alienated practically everyone . " Do n't tell us you 're going to teach him how to paint ! " the easygoingRenoir exclaimed " 1 do n't have to teach Paul Cezanne anything . He is adopting our lighter and fresher palette , giving up plastering from his palette knife . I know I 'm alone in my opinion , but I am convinced that he will emerge into a truly great painter . " There was a skeptical silence . No one believed Camille ; or for that matter wanted to believe him . " He 'll break up our meetings with violent outbursts , " proffered Alfred Sisley , the gentlest of the group . " If we invite him we invite dissension . " " He will come to few meetings . But his Hanged Man ' s House , a picture of which we each painted in Auvers , is as good as anything we 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything he felt so fervently about . With Edouard Manet gone , the Batignolles painters were more and more turning to him for leadership . They knew him to be passionatelydevoted to their cause . Claude Monet said : " D ' accord . But he 's on your head ! " At an April auction at the Hotel Drouot for the benefit of those from the now German-owned Alsace-Lorraine who had emigrated to Algeria , Camille contributed his freshly painted Cultivated Land . It wasp362bought by Duret . Later , Degas fell in love with the painting and TheodoreDuret either gave or sold it to him , Camille never knew which . Nevertheless it was the ultimate compliment from one artist to another . He was equally pleasured when Duret could not restrain himself from buying Camille 's just completed The Inundation of the Seine at Marty for one hundred dollars , and also recommended that his friend , MadameGoblet , buy one of Camille 's paintings . When Duret commissionedfor himself a painting of a growing wheatfield under the coming summer sun , Camille was thoughtful : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing colder than the full sun of summer . Contrary to the colorists , nature is colored in winter and cold in summer . So you must expect to find my picture very chalky and white . " On Camille 's suggestion , Theodore Duret bought one of Claude Monet 's Oise scenes but became disenchanted with the painting as well as with Monet 's ever needful and pressing entreaties . He wanted to return the canvas to Monet ; or at least not pay the second half of the eighty-dollar price . When they next met in Paris , Camille told Duret : " Do n't worry about being mistaken about Monet 's talent . In my opinion it is very serious , very pure . It is a very studied oil based on observation and with an entirely new feeling . It is poetry through harmony of true colors . " Duret was not convinced . Monet , so frequently in extremis , asked Camille to plead for the second forty-dollar payment . The 1873 Salon had come and gone with the Batignolles group not yet ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not submitted paintings . Edouard Manet had had The Good Bock , after Frans Hals , accepted . It was conventional fare and consequently praised . It was not French , it was Dutch : a big-bellied burgher smoking a longstemmedmeerschaum , a fur hat on his big head , grasping fondly a glass of beer . " Pure Haarlem beer ! " someone said . He was praised by the critics but his peers called it " truckling . " Just before the Salon opened , on May 5 , Emile Zola 's young writing protege , Paul Alexis , had written in L ' Avenir National that French artists existed under a rigid exclusionary system of a self-perpetuating jury , and hence " a body of artists would have much to gain by organizing immediately its own syndicate . " He mentioned the names of Monet , Pissarro , Sisley , Jongkind . The Batignolles ' society was publicly horn , something akin to thep363infant of the royal family being presented to the court . The newspaper publicity helped bring in some artists ; frightened others out of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one for the group . Durand-Ruel 's advocacy was having its effect . He began selling their canvases , slowly and at modest albeit rising prices , to adventurous collectors . He paid out to Monet twenty-seven hundred dollars ; to Camille twelve hundred , to Sisley over a thousand , to Degas eighteen hundred . Renoir had been the last to sell ; Durand-Ruel had paid him only one hundred dollars . Renoir had eked out the barest living possible by obtaining portrait commissions . By May of 1873 Camille had already received six hundred dollars in monthly checks . He was now making a comfortable living . He repaid Georges Thouvenal of Montfoucault the sixty dollars he had advanced in November of 187o to enable Camille to take his family to England and marry Julie . Julie bought new shoes and clothing , brought a wider variety of foods into the house . In the earlier years , her nerves frayed by their inadequate income , forced to give herself and Camille short rations in favor of the young ; constantly worried about being unmarriedafter a decade and several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being a Pissarro ; faced with the constant cost of paint and canvas , she had given vent to bursts of temper . Sometimes she had been harsh . Camille had suffered the outbursts in silence . He knew that the responsibility was his . Julie , living in borderline poverty with more children sure to come , had been entitled to her fears and frustrations . Now she felt secure . The children would be cared for . She would not have to suffer the insolence of shopkeepers who refused her further credit when she needed to buy rice , sugar , flour . She could pay , hold her head high as she scaled the hills to shop . Camille completed thirty-nine canvases during 1873 . All the way from a bouquet of roses and a vibrant self-portrait done in his studio through dozens of outdoor motifs of winter in Pontoise : the marketplace , the convent , the heights , the valleys . Then spring along the Oise , the red and pink houses , small neighborhood factories , thatched cottages of Auvers , the roads into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the harvest ripened . He had made up the loss of pictures in the war . Emile Zola had told him , while researching for his Rougon-Macquart series , " Everything is findahle . " Camille had replied , " Everything is paintablc. "  |p364No  longer were there stacks of completed paintings against the walls ; many were now bought by Durand-Ruel or sold to his growing group of collectors . Glorying in his work and steady income ; respectablymarried , the children well ; Rachel coming out to Pontoise for an occasional Sunday visit , Camille was not surprised when Julie cried in a burst of candor : " You were right . All we needed was patience . Could you believe it has taken fifteen years ? " In early July Camille rented a studio at 21 Rue Berthe in Montmartre . He could afford it because Durand-Ruel was paying him a steady one hundred dollars a month . He did not use the small room for work purposes or attempt to bring in Julie and the three children . What it amounted to was a showroom for those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He borrowed an extra easel from Degas , a couple of chairs from Durand-Ruel , on which his prospective customers could sit while he displayed canvases from Louveciennes , Norwood , Pontoise . Etienne Baudry , a small dealer and another of Duret 's cousins , bought one of a Pontoise hillside , Madame Goblet bought a tranquil Louveciennes scene . Camille was having coffee at the Brasserie des Martyrs when Monet and Renoir joined him with a young man whom they introduced as Gustave Caillebotte . He was immaculately dressed in expensive clothing , of medium height , delicate-featured , clean-shaven , with gray eyes , auburn hair and mustache . He was twenty-five , from a family of the grand bourgeoisie , enriched through commerce , a naval engineer and boat builder who had achieved some success in his profession . " What 's he doing with you and Renoir ? " Camille asked with a satiric grin . " That 's just the point ; he 's a man of many interests . Not only constructsships but loves horticulture , stamp collecting and painting . He passed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how good a painter he 'll become but he has an infallible eye for other people 's work . He 's already bought from Renoir and me , our best pictures , by the way . " Caillebotte grasped Camille 's hand . " I greet you most respectfully , " he said in a pleasant voice . " I admireyour work greatly . I 've wanted to buy a pair of your canvases from Durand-Ruel but I hoped to meet you first so that you could guide me. "  | " A pair ! " Camille smiled beatifically . " Paintings are usually bought , with much hand-wringing , one at a time . " Caillebotte flushed . " I know about your group . I think you are the painters of right now ! The academic historical schools have had their century or two ; the Fontainebleau painters are accepted . " Camille fingered his growing graying beard affectionately . " We have n't much to throw in with . Officially we 're a gaggle of struggling individuals . Before the war we were known as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now we 're called the Batignolles after the district we had been living in . " " I 've already acquired an exquisite Edouard Manet and a charming Sisley landscape . Regardez , Monsieur Pissarro . I 'm enchanted with your group ; I want to become a part of it . But I don ' t want to buy my way in . Do you understand ? " The man 's manner was impeccable , the predominant sign was modesty . " I do n't expect I will ever paint as well as any of you . Besides , I 'm not giving up my naval engineering ; it 's a work for which I was trained and that I enjoy . I 've heard about your proposed cooperative exhibition ; I 'm reasonably well trained in management . I am able to help . " " Sacrebleu , we can use help . We would never question your motives ; neither should you ours . " " Now , what is the best way to acquire your paintings ? Through a gallery or at your studio ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already paid for ; to sell from his studio would be money in pocket . But if DurandRuelwas to continue to buy he must also sell . The decision was made . " Could we meet tomorrow at the Durand-Ruel gallery ? I 'd be glad to discuss the merits of my canvases for whatever an artist 's opinion of his own work may be worth . " " D ' accord . ' Caillebotte , Camille found , was more than grateful ; he was generous . The next day he acquired two of Camille 's pictures . He also bought a Degas , a Berthe Morisot , a Cezanne . Except for the dealer Martin , and I ) r . Gachet , Cezanne had never had a buyer . But Caillebottewas by no means an easy sale . He had good taste , instinctively honed in on the best work . He also had a finely tuned sense of irony. " this picture is rejected ? No one wants it ? Fine . I 'll take it . "  |p366In  Pontoise Camille found a copy of the constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nascent society of artists but it provided a beginning prototype . They met at the comfortable house on the Rue Pigalle that Degas now occupied , where the two lower floors were Degas 's living quarters and the top floor his studio , in which there was a welter of newspapers , books , lithographs and watercolorsof earlier artists ; hundreds of his own studies , canvases spread about in seeming chaos . The familiar pipe smoke and smell of wine created an atmosphere in which they were accustomed to debate ideas and harangue each other with theories : Pissarro , Boudin , Monet , Sisley , Renoir , Degas . Berthe Morisot did not find it seemly to attend the meetings . She had authorized Camille to speak for her in matters that needed decision . Some of the provisions of the bakers ' union were quickly voted down : a separate section for minors ; a secret ballot for admission . The proposal eventually took the form of a joint stock company with shares and articles of partnership . Each member was to contribute sixty francs , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; all had equal rights , with administration to be handled by a council of fifteen elected members , one third to be renewed each year . The Societe was to receive a commission of ten per cent on all sales . Eugene Boudin , oldest of the group , approaching fifty , a student of Millet and already established for his small , exquisite scenes of the changing light of sea and sky , knew the terrors of exhibiting all too well . " Now , we need at least twenty good conventional painters , those who have shown in the Salon once or twice , to blunt the critics ' attacks . The public 's as well . " Alfred Sisley agreed . " It 's a way of staying out of a storm . " Renoir responded with a thin edge of sarcasm . " We can escape even better by not showing at all . " No painter would be barred because of subject matter ; but they must demand professionalism and an excellence of technique . How did they set their standards ? They used Daubigny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the 1870 Salon jury , saying :  | " If I am unable to apprize excellence , I have wasted my life . " The problem became , " Not who do we keep out ? " but , " How do we get painters in ? " They passed the word around that the exhibition would be open to those who qualified . They scoured the ateliers , schools , Beaux-Arts classes . The number who qualified and refused their offer became larger than the few who accepted . The rejected ones now found themselves rejected . " Why ? " they asked each other . It had never been done before . It could not work . It was an affront to the Beaux-Arts . They would be banned from the Salon . They did not want to be associated with revolutionary work or the Batignolles group ; did not want to be labeled . It was all the fears they themselves had had , and several others . For their next meeting Claude Monet invited everyone out to Argenteuilfor a Sunday of painting the pleasure crafts moored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this pleasant cottage for two hundred dollars a year , which Monet raised through Durand-Ruel 's purchases and his own effective salvos on the collectors of Paris . Leonielit her wood stove at four in the afternoon to feed her guests . Their son Jean , dressed in a suit of knitted pantaloons , rode a tricycle around the garden paths . After their years of bleak poverty there was an air of gaiety in the Monet house . Claude donned tan trousers and a brown tweed jacket which gave him the appearance of a country gentleman . The artists gathered in the studio room , their faces showing dimly in the light of an oil lamp . They took up where they had left off . So far eight of their own group had agreed to show , with Boudin making a ninth and Bracquemond , longtime friend of Whistler , a tenth . Fantin-Latour , the faithful portrait painter of the group , could not make up his mind . He was important to them . He agreed with the last person to harangue him , but in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had shown in the Salon . The outsiders who accepted were Astruc , painter-critic , Attendu , Beliard , Brandon , Bureau , Cols , Colin , Debras , Latouche , who had sold several of Camille 's canvases , Lepic , Lepine , Levert , Meyer , De Molins , Mulot-Durivage , the Italian De Nittis , the sculptor Ottin , Robert , Rouart , nineteen in all , a substantial number . Their next order of business was to name the new organization.  | " Call it the Frederic Bazille Society , " said Camille . " It would be a fitting memorial to the one painter we lost in the war . " Claude Monet agreed ; but the others had objections : " It would confuse the public , put the emphasis in the wrong place . " Boudin suggested they name the exhibition in honor of Gustave Courbet , whose body of work had been a guiding beacon . Courbet was only fifty-four , but his imprisonment had so undermined his health that he was no longer able to paint . His magnificent creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another trial was impending . A testimonial was in order . " But not our exhibition , " Degas said firmly . " It will bring the police down on our heads . Courbet 's shoulders are already overburdened . " Auguste Renoir gathered attention with an in-sweeping movement of his arms . " I object to using a title with a precise meaning . If we are called The Somebodies ' or The So-and-Sos ' or even The Thirty-nine ' the critics will immediately start talking of a new school . ' I suggest Anonymous Cooperative Society of Artists , Painters , Sculptors and Engravers . " " How do you expect people to remember that ? " Degas asked . " Renoir does n't want them to , " Camille replied . " He wants the public to remember the paintings instead . Let 's accept his title and have done with it . " Next they tackled the problem of how the show would be hung . Who would get the best spots ? Who would be in " the catacombs " ? How could they be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? No . A committee always ended in a brawl . Then whose judgment would they trust ? It finally came down again to Renoir . " My father was a tailor . I should know how to stitch together an exhibition of about a hundred and fifty canvases . " During the following weeks Edouard Manet , after Durand-Ruel had sold Le Bon Bock to Faure for a sizable amount , tried to break up the society . He said to Berthe Morisot , Renoir and Claude Monet : " Why do n't you stay with me ? You can see very well that I am on the right track . " To Degas he emphasized , " Exhibit with the Salon and you may receive an honorable mention . " But he had lost his position as leader of the Batignolles painters . At their next meeting , at the Brasserie des Martyrs , they solved the problem of where they could hold the exhibition . Felix Nadar , the most successful portrait photographer in Paris , had acquired fame during the Franco-Prussian War as a daring balloonist behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for a drink . Nadar had earlier permitted Monet to paint the Boulevard des Capucines from the front window of his reception hall . He had an enormously wide forehead with clumps of hair extended over his ears and wore his white photographer 's jacket even in the cafes ; his sober eyes were studious , as though under his dark cape gazing at life through the ground glass of his lens . The forehead narrowing down through a modest mustache and neat rounded chin gave his head the appearance of an upsidedownpyramid . " Why not use my studio on the Boulevard des Capucines ? " he asked . " I 've leased larger quarters elsewhere for next year and I 'm moving out April 1 . " Paul Cezanne , whom Camille had steered away from most of the meetings , asked with an edge of suspicion : " How much will it cost us ? " " My rent is paid through May . The rooms would be standing idle . You can pay the gas bill for the month you 're in , the guard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ omnibus to Nadar 's studio . The corner of the Boulevarddes Capucines and the Rue Daunou was at the very heart of Paris , in the center of the Madeleine , the fashionable shops and sidewalk cafes where much of Paris passed in the course of a day ; and as Nadar had said , " That portion of Paris with money to buy luxuries . " He walked up the broad flight of stairs that led directly from the street to the entresol , entered the waiting room . It was comfortably furnished with lounge chairs , sofas , where Nadar 's clients awaited their turn to be photographed . There was oblique light from the street and sufficient wall space for half a dozen medium-sized pictures . Monet and Degas were waiting for him . Together they toured the series of four large photographing rooms , each set with a different background . The walls were red-brown , without juttings or partitions , admirable for hanging framed pictures . They now had thirty painters , each of whom wanted to show between three and six works . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to crowd the frames or place too many above or below eye level . " Their jottings convinced them that the four rooms and reception hall would afford the wall space they would need . Gustave Caillebotte gave them dinner in his elegant family home on the Faubourg St. Ilonore to settle the remaining points of disagreement . He had already done a number of practical chores : secured ap370license from the police ; hired two guards , a ticket salesman and the automatic turnstile used at the Palais de l'Industrie so that the Society could not be cheated as Courbet had been at his showing . He had also tracked down Nadar 's gas and water bills so the group would know exactly how much expense they were incurring . He gazed at Camille over a glass of vintage wine , sifted his thoughts through a finely meshed strainer . He was eighteen years younger than Camille . " Your group of painters is like a new-found group of brothers for me . " There was a general feeling of buoyancy and optimism . The Society of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1874 , and show for a month . As he had planned , Camille searched for and found a good home at 26 Rue de l'Hermitage , above the river . One approached it by a curving path up a slight hill . The ground floor was earthen , no wood floor ever having been laid . Connecting the ground floor to the four bedrooms upstairs was a rustic winding wooden staircase with uneven steps and a narrow , loosely fitted railing of assorted branches . " It 's no more dangerous than climbing trees , " said Camille when Julie looked at it askance . Unlike the living room and dining area , the kitchen floor was of stone . It had an open fireplace for roasting meats and boiling pots of soup . The room was large enough to hold her stove , wall pegs for pans and skillets , a chopping-block table , and a corner where she could feed the children . There was a good well just outside the back door and a level area on the hillock for growing flowers and vegetables and placingher rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay a wood floor in the living and dining rooms before the winter rains . Hauling the beds , wardrobe , tables up the winding staircase , which hung by some mysterious act of levitation , required a considerable engineering effort . Yet when all of the furniture had been put in its appropriate place and Camille had arranged his books on the former crockery shelves of the dining area and decorated the walls with hisp371drawings , watercolors and oils of Louveciennes , the clean dry house was attractive . He also appropriated one of the bedrooms for a studio . Minette became ill . Camille summoned the Pontoise physician , Dr. Menier . He diagnosed bronchitis . The following day he declared that he feared typhoid . Camille wrote a note to Dr. Gachet : " . . . Minette is sick . For four or five days , we have n't lived . W e are so anxious . . . . Dr. Gachet arrived in Pontoise on his way to Auvers . He examined Minette carefully , prescribed an herbal potion for her sore throat , made no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no better . Dr. Gachet prescribed calcaria carbonica . Dr. Menier still suspected typhoid . The medication seemed to help but the fever persisted . Dr. Gachet visited again . For an entire month Camille and Julie agonized . He did not touch his paints or go into Paris . On October 30 , 1873 , he read that the opera house on the Rue Le Peletier was greatly damaged by fire . Fortunately there was no harm to Durand-Ruel 's gallery close by , but the shops in the Rue Drouot near the Drouot auction halls had to be evacuated . The fire made it possible to start construction , at the center of the series of wide boulevards , on the new opera Baron Haussmann had proposed in 1857 . By mid-November Minette 's temperature became normal . She appearedwell , if not robust . Camille took up his paints and in December trudged through the snow to find meaning in its hidden barren beauty . Theodore Duret came out to Pontoise , exchanged the Inundation which he had bought earlier for Springtime , giving Camille an additional forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your three little donkeys with the shepherdess is as beautiful as a Millet . " Camille 's eyes sparkled . " That 's high praise . I am a longtime admirer of Millet 's Angelus and The Gleaners . " " Will you guide me in buying a Cezanne ? In painting I look more than ever for sheep with five legs . " " In that case I believe that Cezanne can satisfy you ; he has made some studies that are very strange . " The art critic was only the fourth collector to buy a Cezanne . On his next trip into Paris Durand-Ruel informed Camille that a financial crisis was taking place in France , with severe repercussions in the city . Stocks on the Bourse were plummeting . The gallery had notp372yet been seriously affected but when money became scarce art works were always the first to feel the pinch . He added reassuringly : " I 've sold several of your canvases . After the turn of the year I shall pay you a record four hundred dollars in three installments . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a painting , for one hundred dollars . Camille was exultant . The future looked bright . Although his growing family 's needs , doctors ' bills and painting supplies used up all the money that came in , each year would be better as his work was more widely accepted . Camille signed the charter for the Society . On January 17 , 1874 , La Chronique des Arts announced : An anonymous co-operative society , of variable size and capital , has been formed by painters , sculptors , engravers and lithographers , for a period of ten years , from the 27 Decemberlast , having for its aim , ( 1 ) the organization of free exhibitions , without a jury or honorary reward , where each of the members may exhibit his work ; ( 2 ) the sale of said works ; ( 3 ) the publication , as soon as possible , of a journal exclusively concerned with the arts . In late January Ernest Hoschede , owner of the Gagne Petit departmentstore who had bought a number of the group 's paintings , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Hotel Drouot . The Hotel Drouot was privately owned by the Compagnie des Commissaires-Priseurs de Paris , who had built it in 1852 , and was devoted only to auctions , which had before then been held at the Bourse . It was a handsome three-story building on the corner of the rues Drouot and Rossini , with an angled glass front where the two streets joined . The first-floor promenade was majestic , with high ceilingsand wide-spaced pillars resembling an ancient monastery . The men in the promenade wore high silk hats and striped trousers . The women were in floor-length gowns and flounces , covered with largecollaredcloaks . The main auction salon was an enormous room with triple gas chandeliers , a carpeted floor , tall rostrum at the front with a large padded chair for the auctioneer . There were only a few movable stools for the buyers , which caused a jam-up among the bidders , some of whom were socializing in groups , others examining framed paintings , still others at the rear pawing over a jumbled mass of antique dressing tables and chiffoniers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thep373auctioning of porcelain faIences and all manner of objets d'art . The scene looked like pandemonium , yet somehow the auctioneer knew where his bids were coming from and pounded his gavel at the conclusionof each sale . Camille and Monet attended the opening day to see what their paintings would bring . Though the owners were supposed to be anonymous , everyone knew it was Ernest Hoschede 's collection . They got there just before the opening hammer . Since it was a dark Parisian day , gas jets were flaring around the sides of the cream-colored room . It was filled by the time Renoir and Degas drifted in . There was a feeling of tension and excitement . People appeared eager to bid and acquire . Camille was gratified when his pictures were sold for fifty-four to nearly two hundred dollars each . Monet , Sisley and Degas were bid up to equally high prices . Camille wrote to Duret : " The effects of the Drouot sale are felt all the way to Pontoise . People were quite surprised that one of my pictures would go for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a surprisingprice for a pure landscape ! " The best part of it for the Society members was that the auction could be trusted as a weather vane for their coming exhibition . Their work had been treated with respect . There could not be a better omen . Durand-Ruel informed them that the auction set the value level . They would get equally good prices at the Society 's showing . After that , he would hold his auction in the banker Edwards 's apartment on the Boulevard Haussmann . That should go even better than the Drouot . He was painting in his studio when Duret arrived unannounced , having taken the early morning train . He was unshaven , his clothing disheveled , his voice almost hoarse as he cried : " You must n't . You simply must not ! " Camille was taken aback . Duret was usually a very self-possessed man . But Theodore Duret had read the announcement in the Chronique and had heard bad repercussions . " I 've been up all night , " he cried , " wrestling with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear me out . " Camille put an arm about the man 's shoulders . " Anything you say is in season . " " It is necessary that you resign from your Anonymous Society , " Duret began . " You must not be a part of that proposed exhibition . It is a radical plan , defying criticism . You now have a small group of art lovers and collectors , your name is known to critics . After the Drouotp374auction you are on the verge of success , coming face to face with the big public . For that purpose there are only the auctions at the Hotel Drouot , the established galleries and the official Salon . You can not show at an unsponsored exhibition of a private society . . . . " Duret paced the stonework of the studio floor . He was Camille 's most ardent collector . He was genuinely concerned that Camille 's work would now be associated with painters who had to contrive their own exhibitions . He would be risking his career . Camille was upset over his friend 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll attract a good audience from the Boulevard des Capucines , " he said . Duret shook his head in a heavy No ! " The Hoschede sale brought you before a fixed and numerous public . It will not accept this exhibition . You must resign . " " Mon Men ! I am one of the organizers of the Society . We 've been working together for fifteen months . You seemed to agree . " " Before . Not now . " Camille held Duret to him . " Come , take off those clothes you 've wrestled in all night . A few hours ' nap will refresh you . I can not tell you how much I appreciate your concern for me . " When Duret left , Camille put on his warmest jacket , a wool cap and boots , and beat his way through the snow-covered woods . Duret was a gentle man , quiet . He must indeed have wrestled with himself before coming to the Hermitage . Could he really do himself serious damage ? Manet had thought so , Guillemet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . So had all those who had refused to join them . Had things really changed for him ? Had he been misguided , made a serious blunderjust when events were beginning to go well ? Was he endangering the security of Julie and the children ? He plunged through the thick woods , trying to siphon the toxicity of his mind through his legs and feet into the resilient earth . He had always found relief by walking off inner doubts . Even if his face and toes froze in the late January cold . While it was true that his position seemed to have improved , it was equally true that all Duret 's arguments had been considered when they formed their Society . They expected to be discriminated against by the established Salon and the conventional collectors . But the Salon had never done anything for them . The Nadar gallery would be a good hall ; its entrance off the street would attract many people ; their work would be well hung . . . .  |p375It  took an hour of plying the darkening forest before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the soft loam of the earth which rekindles faith and courage . In February Julie became certain that she was pregnant again . They took the news philosophically . " I sha n't mind , " she declared . " I would like another girl to go with the boys . " Then , for no reason they or the doctors could understand , Minette took a severe turn . She complained of pain in her calves and legs ; her lips were swollen . Dr. Menier thought he perceived traces of scarlet fever . Dr. Gachet gave her a potion of aconite . Each time the fever appeared they fed her orangeade and bouillon , put poultices on her stomach and synapismes on her chest . Dr. Gachet became alarmed . The pains in Minette 's calves and legs could mean rheumatic fever . He ordered asafetida , which they secured from a pharmacy in Pontoise , to relieve the symptoms . Nine-year-old Minette grew steadily weaker and died on April 6 . She had succumbed , after all , to the debilitating effects of scarlet fever . Walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grancey and the burial of the Hermance child . " We followed the young parents behind the coffin . The carpenter made a gift of a willow cradle , ' the coffin for the little one . I gathered daisies and dahlias from my garden . We made garlands of paper and a small cross to decorate the cradle . " She began to sing : " The song of the nightingale will come to wake her And also the warbler with his sweet throat . Cicada , my cicada , let 's go , we must sing . For the laurels of the woods are already growing again . " Camille was stricken . He and his daughter had been devoted to each other . They had understood from the slightest gesture or change of expression what was signified . She had posed for him , days on end , sitting admiringly while he painted her portraits , each showing thep376depth of his affection for the charming little girl . His world would seem empty without her . An important part of his life had been torn away . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distraught to go into Paris to see how the exhibition was coming along . He got reports of the selections from Monet , who took Camille 's paintings into Paris for him . Now , in spite of his grief , he decided he must attend the opening on April 15 . He must lend support to the others , particularly after Duret 's attack . He told Julie that she need not attend if it would be too hard for her . She asked if the other wives would be there . They were speaking in subdued tones , as though not to disturb the now buried Minette . " I understand so : Leonie , Hortense Fiquet , Sisley 's Marie , perhaps Alexandrine Zola . You 'll have plenty of company . " Though it was the kind of private showing at which Durand-Ruel would have served champagne and hors d'oeuvres , the Society decided against that ; they did not have the money . Neither would they supply sitting benches ; they wanted the crowds to move steadily from room to room . Cezanne commented : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy is like standing under the guillotine waiting for a royal reprieve . " There were one hundred and sixty-five canvases . The prices were attached unobtrusively to each , sums from forty to one hundred dollars . Hundreds of people mounted the steps and thronged through the galleries . Some were Salon habitues , others were interested in the fringes of art ; many were impelled by curiosity . The rest were passersbyon the Boulevard des Capucines , attracted by the crowds going up the stairs , through the turnstile , into the entresol . They were well dressed and groomed , as one would expect in this neighborhood of the Madeleine . The six stalwarts , Camille , Monet , Sisley , Renoir , Degasand Berthe Morisot , had pictures hanging in Nadar 's waiting room . They glowed like the rose-colored windows of Sainte Chapelle . Renoir had actually got the one hundred sixty-five pictures on the walls withoutcrowding , hanging frame to frame , yet creating a harmony with few color clashes , the smaller pictures below the larger , but still at a visible height . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pontoise , The Orchard and two others . Monet showed nine canvases , among them Breakfast and Boulevard des Capucines . Degas had ten canvases on the walls , Berthe Morisot nine , Renoir seven , Sisley five , Boudin three ,  |p377Guillaumin  two , Bracquemond two and Cezanne three . The others , one or two each . When Camille and Julie arrived in midafternoon , hundreds of spectatorsappeared to be turning the Nadar galleries into a carnival . All four rooms were jammed with pushing , shoving , hysterical voyeurs . The noise level was staggering . It hit him like a blow in the face as they made their way through the throng from the foyer into the first gallery room . The public had gone straight as a sharp-twanged arrow to the Batignolles paintings , ignoring the conventional canvases , jeering , mocking , crying out , " Absurd ! Insulting ! Desecrating ! " A group circledin front of Degas 's Dance Class ; Renoir 's The Loge ; Monet 's Impression : Sunrise ; Cezanne 's Hanged Man 's House from Auvers ; Sisley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost , even Berthe Morisot 's The Cradle . He tried to sort out the enveloping noise but could hear only the derisive laughter , the abusive indignation , shouts of ridicule being bandied from painting to painting . It was a scene out of a ribald theatrical revue ; a raucous farce . Camille , encountering a bewildered and somewhat pale Alfred Sisley , heard himself crying out : " How can landscapes , pictures of the theater , of ballet dancers , of laundresses , or the racetrack , arouse such bedlam ? People are pointing and shouting at our canvases as though there was something indecent about them . " Sisley replied disconsolately , " It 's the Salon des Refuses all over again . Worse ! " Julie and the other wives hovered in a distant corner . Only Berthe Morisot breasted the storm . Beautifully garbed , she went from one jeering encirclement to another , speaking to the women visitors , attempting to explain the new techniques and values . She could barely make herself heard . Camille gazed at the large crowd of disbelievers they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would bother to climb the outside stairs to the entresol . " I had n't realized hysteria was contagious , " he murmured . Opening day they sold nothing . Degas offered consolation , inviting the group to the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes , saying , " An hour of this Indian suttee immolation is more than enough . But this is the beginning , not the end . Some of these people , foundering now in mob psychology , will return and buy . " Disturbed that his clever arrangement of their provocative picturesp378surrounded by conventional ones had not helped , Renoir could only add : " At least they each paid their twenty cents admission . We should take in fifty dollars today ; that 'll cover a week 's upkeep . But why is n't anybody buying our catalogue at only ten cents ? " " Because they do n't want our cast of Grand Guignol characters , " Cezanne growled cynically . Out in the street the crowds were still forming in line to climb Nadar 's stairway . Camille was grim , his back teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come in the quieter days ahead . " Not if the press had anything to say about it . There were appreciative words from the liberal journalists of the cafes Guerbois and Nouvelle Athenes , an understanding review by Armand Silvestre in L'Opinion Nationale : . . . The landscapists Monet , Sisley and Pissarro do not at all resemble the past masters . It has a plausible side , affirmed with conviction . It is above all decorative ; an effect of an impression . Philippe Burty in La Republique Francaise wrote : . . . even if feelings are registered that are at times as fleeting as the feeling of the freshness of the forest , a breeze of warmth from the bay , the listlessness of an autumn evening . . . one must be grateful to those young artists who have been able to pursue and catch those impressions . And this is how they have joined their work to that of the Old Masters . But they were drowned out by vindictiveness and recrimination . " Cezanne can only be a kind of madman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sisley sees nature with too narrow a vision . . . . " " Degas 's dancer 's legs are as cottony as her gauze skirt . . . . " " Pissarro is rather crude in color . . . a still uncultivated surface . . . . " Those are cabbages ? Oh , the poor wretches . They are caricatured . I swear not to eat any more as long as I live . " About Monet 's Boulevard des Capucines , " What do those interminable black tongue-lickings in the lower part of the canvas represent ? Surely not people ? " And his Breakfast , " Two of the most absurd daubs in that laughable collection of absurdities . " " Degas 's The Laundress is badlyp379laundered . . . . " " Berthe Morisot does n't know how to draw . When she has a hand to paint she makes as many brush strokes lengthwise as there are fingers . " " Monet , Pissarro , Berthe Morisot appear to have declared war on beauty . " Of all the Batignolles , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " " They are f e a r f u l daubs . . . . " " They load a pistol with several tubes of paint and fire it at the canvas . . . . " " When children amuse themselves with paper and colors , they do better . . . . " " Soon to be abandoned . " Emile Cardon wrote in La Presse : The famous Salon des Refuses , about which one could not speak without laughing , that Salon where one saw women the color of Spanish tobacco , on yellow horses in the middle of forests with blue trees , that Salon was the Louvre in comparison with the exhibition at the Boulevard des Capucines . The coup de grace was delivered by Berthe Morisot 's early teacher . Morisot read them the letter written to her mother by Monsieur Guichard of Lyon . " I 've seen Nadar 's salons , and I want to give you immediately my sincere impression . Upon entrance , dear lady , I was seized by a contractionof the heart as I saw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to myself : " One does n't live unscathed amidst the mad . " Manet was right to obstruct his exhibit . Examining , analyzing , conscientiously , one admittedly finds here and there excellent bits , but all are more or less soft in the head . ' " The same comment ran through many of the articles . A critic seized on Monet 's Impression : Sunrise , suggesting that the Batignolles artists were painting just that : Impressions . Monet 's Boulevard des Capucines was labeled an Impression . A writer in the newspaper Le Charivari , Louis Leroy , took a hypotheticalBeaux-Arts painter through the exhibit . Leroy wrote what appeared to be satire under the heading , " Exhibition of the Impression-ists . " Very quietly , with my most naive air , I led him before The Plowed Field Hoar Frost of Monsieur Pissarro . At the sight of this astounding landscape the good man thought that the lenses of his spectacles were dirty . " What on earth is that ? "  | " A hoar frost on deeply plowed furrows . " " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed uniformly on a dirty canvas . It has neither head nor tail , neither top nor bottom , neither front nor back . " " Perhaps . But the impression is there . " " What is this ? " " An orchard by Monsieur Sisley . . . the small tree on the right ; the impression . . . " " What does that canvas depict ? " " It 's Claude Monet 's Impression : Sunrise . " " Impression ! I was certain of it . Since I was impressed , there had to be some impression in it . Wallpaper in its embryonicstate is more finished than that seascape . Oh , Corot , Corot , what crimes are committed in your name . " Through buffoonery a new name was coined : Impressionism . Thus Monet and Camille , who , sitting before Camille 's fireplace in Pontoise had formed the Societe Anonyme , and were responsible for the showing , were also responsible for the birth of their new name . The journals , the critics , the commentators , the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of derision creating farcical laughter wherevermentioned . Neither were the members of the Batignolles group pleased ; they objected to the word , objected to being labeled . Camille alone thought it acceptable . When a week later they met at the Brasseriedes Martyrs to lick their wounds , he declared : " We are a movement . Our efforts to disguise ourselves by bringing in conventional outsiders did not fool anyone . The critics found us instantly , and exposed us . " " Dubbing us Impressionists , " complained Degas . " It 's an indignity and disparagement . A stick to beat a dog . " Camille remained unruffled . " Is n't that what we are about , painting our impressions ? How else do we express ourselves ? Corot , the first time I was taken to his studio , told me that the muse was in the woods and I was to paint my impression of what I saw as reflected through my feelings . We 're all Impressionists ? Good . Let us wear the name as a badge of honor . It has meaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Nine of them were around the cafe table : Monet , Sisley , Degas ,  |p381Renoir  , Berthe Morisot , Guillaumin , Boudin . Even Cezanne . They lifted their glasses , beer mugs , coffee cups in salute . In a subtle way the leadership of the Impressionists passed into the hands of Camille Pissarro . From now on it would be his responsibility to make the name " Impressionism " respectable ; to lead the Impressionistsinto acceptance and prosperity . Before they had had a cohesionor a name , Edouard Manet had been their leader . Then he rejectedtheir desire to show independently . When two of the three pictures he had submitted to the 1874 Salon were rejected , and the third , Railroad , was accused of being " a fearful daub cut out of sheet tin , " he became thoroughly out of sorts and accused the Impressionists , a name he disdained , once again of having abandoned him . Camille announced : " The critics are devouring us and accusing us of not studying . I am returning to my work ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing from them . " He had been " washing the head of a donkey . " Yet if he had it all to do over again , he would follow the same path . He had no choice then , from the moment he picked up pencil and charcoal in St. Thomas at the age of ten . He had no choice now . He had to go on living , which meant painting . Loving life ; loving his family ; loving the world as it existed . Life did not end . Only painting counted.  |p385The  Impressionist exhibition had closed , after a full month . As far as visibility was concerned , the show had been successful , with thirtyfivehundred viewers attending , five hundred of them in the evening . The sales had ranged from dismal to devastating . Camille sold one canvas for twenty-six dollars . Cezanne sold his Hanged Man ' s House to Comte Doria for twenty dollars . Alfred Sisley proved to be the star attraction , selling two hundred dollars ' worth of canvases . Monet and Renoir sold one painting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Neither did Boudin or Bracquemond . Nor did the conventional painters , whose canvases were ignored in the hullabaloo . The painters trundled home their pictures , a symbolic R provided by the public . The abuse showered upon the Society had done an effective job of souring the collectors on the so-called Impressionists . His own dealer , Martin , joined the chorus when he said publicly : " I was wrong about Pissarro . He is doomed by his heavy approach to nature . " Durand-Ruel remained loyal . He had been suffering from the deepeningdownturn of ' the economy but had still managed to pay Camillep386one hundred dollars on April 17 , for an earlier sale . Then one hundred and forty dollars on May ig after the exhibition closed , from a collectorwho had left a sizable deposit on a Pontoise landscape . There would be no more . Because of his spirited advocacy of the " Impressionist " painters , public confidence in him fled . In order to pay his expenses he had to sell off most of his superb Fontainebleau canvases for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constantinople , who had hung Durand-Ruel 's best canvases in his Boulevard Haussmann apartment against the advances he had made to the dealer , now declared that all the pictures belonged to him ; that Durand-Ruel had no further claim on them . The painters had been paid only token sums and had to consider their paintings lost . It was a considerable time before Camille and his friends met at the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes for a session of what Degas labeled " sittingup with the corpse . " The Nouvelle Athenes on the Place Pigalle in Montmartre had a face of white paint . The glass door of the cafe grated on the sand floor as one opened it . The painters had privacy at the two right-hand marble tables between the front of the cafe and the glass partition which walled off the large coffeehouse behind it , the formal restaurant being upstairs . Frequently the group argued , debated , theorized about art until the shutters were banged closed behind them at midnight . George Moore , a waspish young English author , said to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the official stupidity you read of in the daily papers . The same old story : the vanquished only are the victorious . " Moore 's verdict that he preferred the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes to Oxford or Cambridge for an education did not raise the painters ' spirits . " Is there anything worse than being unwanted ? " Alfred Sisley asked timidly . " Yes . Being incapable , " Renoir spat out . Gustave Caillebotte tried a philosophic approach . " Plato said all is flux . Newton said that whatever goes up must come down . We 'll rebound on the next swing . " There was agreement among the painters present that no more group exhibitions were wanted . Claude Monet was glooming into his empty beer mug . Camille alone dissented . " The abuse will wear out faster than we will . We must train the eye of the viewer . "  |p387He  convinced no one , least of all himself . Back in Pontoise he found his words a hollow reassurance . Day by day he fell into a deeper mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inner yearning for her . The organization as such was dead ; the members had taken too solid a beating . They had told him so . TheodoreDuret had been an accurate prophet . When he drummed up enough courage to visit Durand-Ruel he found the gallery as abandoned as an old warehouse , the dealer collapsedin melancholy behind his imposing desk . " I have been declared guilty of having presented and defended your works . Now I am feeling the backlash . I am treated as a madman and as a man of bad faith . The confidence I came to inspire has disappeared . I have become suspect with my best clients . How can you , ' they said , after having been one of the first to like the School of 183o , now praise to us pictures in which there is not the shadow of quality ? ' I must start over again , after all these years of work converting amateurs one by one . I have neither paintings nor money nor reputation . I could n't sell a Leonardo da Vinci as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has also brought me down . " Camille was shocked by Durand-Ruel 's dismal tone . He was stricken with a feeling of guilt . " I 'm bitterly sorry that the four years you have spent supporting us has brought you only public condemnation . " Durand-Ruel 's noble face and voice softened . " It 's no one 's fault . I believed in you with all my heart . I still do . But there 's no more help I can give you . It will be years before I will be able to buy from you again . You 'll have to find other markets . I do n't know where . " He turned away , not wanting Camille to see the stark hopelessness in his eyes . The incomparable Paul Durand-Ruel , who had been so lifegivingto them all , would also be gone . Back home , Camille sat in his studio , chin on his chest . He walked the cool green woods or open fields without easel or canvas on his back . He awoke each day with a dull ache . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meaning seemed to have been drained out of it . He wrote something of this to Armand Guillaumin , who came to visit the following weekend . They walked down the road in the June sunshine , the fields coining green with new life . Guillaumin clung to his clerk 's job . He said sternly :  | " I know that times are hard . But the utmost anarchy reigns in the opposite camp . Our enemies will tumble . " That week Duret took him to a tavern in Pontoise where , over a bottle of the same brandy he was selling throughout France , though on a lesser scale now that hard times had hit the country , he tried to ease Camille 's despair . " There are still art lovers of taste but they are not the rich patrons who pay high prices , they are the buyers in the sixty- , eighty- and onehundred-dollarclass . Very few of the people who understand your work and who brave the ridicule are millionaires . While counting on the judgment of connoisseurs you must compensate yourself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duret or his brandy , Camille felt a flow of warmth in his innards . " My business is not good these days , " continued Duret , " but I can afford to acquire one more of your paintings . With the purchase you have to listen to a few words of advice . Some people feel your landscapesare uninhabited . You should therefore do some genre paintings , with animals and peasants , men , women , children in full scale , not merely symbolic figures . " The fall from grace was hardest on Julie , now thirty-five , in her eighth month of her sixth birth . She had for the most part accepted their hardships stoically , going about the business of feeding her family . She had manifestly enjoyed the respectability , the respite from gnawing anxiety , and imagined that their future was secure . Now it was gone , the optimism , the illusion that they stood on a solid base . She perceived with a terrifying clarity that their lives were like the newly invented roller skates , which would cause their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their derrieres . They had moved again in April , from the Rue de l'Hermitage 26 to i8 bis , with a small stone building across from their front door which Camille would use as a studio ; and a little more space . A son , whom they named Felix , was born in late July . The birth of the boy revitalized Camille , and he again began going out at dawn . In their prosperous time he had designed a movable studio which was built by a local carpenter : a cart of two wheels with an upright frame to hold a big gray umbrella and eye-level canvas , a two-drawer structure beneath , a top drawer for his tubes of paint and brushes , the bottom for extra canvas , rags , turpentine . Every morning saw him on the maturing hillsides around Pontoise ; yet there was a difference . He was not paint/ing as though driven ; rather , he was led on by the harmonious forces again working within him , achieving a landscape of superb greens , later an asymmetrical haystack with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominated the harvested plain . He did a plum tree in bloom , several studies of the banks of the Oise , a nearby quarry , prairies , a full sun on the countryside . He no longer questioned whether his work was good . His companionswere too busy with their own problems to make judgments . Cezannewas in Aix , hiding his mistress and son and painting the village of L'Estaque , to which he returned as to a balm ; Monet was in Argenteuilwith his wife and child , bitterly pressed for money , writing beggingletters to his collectors . Renoir , penniless in his Paris studio , spent much of his time with the Monet family . Caillebotte , also living in Argenteuil , helped when he could . Alfred Sisley had fled to England with his wife and two children , painting around Hampton Court and recuperating from the Impressionist fiasco . No one came to Pontoise to paint with Camille . In the fall a letter arrived from Piette saying that he hoped that his " dear Pissarro " was not as hard up as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassing him too , he should come to Montf'oucault where they could make excursions in his horse-drawn buggy and find new motifs in the surroundings . Julie , recovering from the birth of Felix , was eager to go . He could not resist her entreaty . The last of Duret 's check would pay for the railroad tickets . He would have a chance to paint the genre pictures Duret had asked for , portraits of people and animals in landscapes . He told his landlord at 18 bis Rue de 1'Hermitage that he expected to be gone about three months and did not have the money to pay in advance for that period , offering to move his furniture into storage . The landlord did not think it likely he would rent the house once winter fell , and allowed him to leave everything as it was . If he did rent it he would move their things to a barn nearby . They closed the house , placed the baby in a basket , gave each boy a bundle to carry , changed gares in Paris , ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick-crusted bread out of Julie 's large canvas market bag , turning the swaying , rattling train trip into a family picnic . Piette and Adeele met them at the train . There was no mistaking their intense joy in seeing the Pissarros.  | " We 've been rattling around this big house like a couple of phantoms , " Adele cried . " I hope the boys are hellions and make lots of noise . Yes , even little Felix . Our walls need sound to keep them from moldering . " Once again she gave them the room with the fireplace and an abundantsupply of wood from the forest behind the farmhouse . Julie kept the baby , now three months old , in a borrowed crib by her bedside . Lucien , eleven , and Georges , three , slept downstairs in the small room off the kitchen , whose giant stove kept it dry and moderately warm . For themselves , Piette set up a brazier , a round pan in which they burned short logs early in the evening so they would remain glowing embers through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment house in Paris , which had been shelled during the war , had been sold off for its land value . Since he had had a heavy mortgage on the property , he realized little in cash . An out-of-work farm family with two strong adolescent sons had moved into the stone building formerly occupied by Piette 's overseer and were working the farm and its animals . Although prices were low , he was selling enough to give them all a precarious living . Released from manual labor , he was free to paint with Camille every day . Lucien shepherded Georges around the pond . Adele became Tante to the infant . Though Julie was breast-feeding Felix , Adele took care of him , pretending he was her own . She had not-been able to afford even a village girl to help her with the housework , but now the wife of the tenant family did the laundry and heavy cleaning . Julie baked round breads in the fireplace oven . Even washing the dishes was not an unwelcome chore for the two women whose companionship made everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to sell off any of his land . " It is n't that I have anyone to leave the farm to , " he explained to Camille as they walked toward the natural pond where the cattle drank and the geese marched in single file . " But my great-grandfather left it to his son , who left it to my father . It 's a trust . " Painting side by side , Camille saw what was still lacking in Piette 's work : closer organization and a stronger statement about the reality of nature 's forms . He could help him improve his composition , make a better harmony of his colors . But every man 's interpretation of the universe had to be his own . In the characterful countryside of Mayenne , Camille was able to put the failure of the exhibition and the abuse behind him ; the months cut out of time and torment. p 391 " Why go back at all ? " Piette asked . " There 's always wood for the fireplace , milk , butter , cheese , meat from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy together . " Camille studied his friend . " We must return to L'Hermitage and Paris . The market is there , the collectors , the exhibitions . . . . " " You 're not selling . " " Today has a tendency to become tomorrow . On all the tomorrows I must place my paintings . There is no other way . " Julie was happy , the boys were thriving on the hearty food . Camille painted every day now , making up for the months of brooding and inactivity . Taking Duret 's advice , he painted a young girl with a long branch attending cattle on the edge of the pond and half a dozen geese swimming in circles . He used broad strokes on the surface of the water surrounded by a variegated palette of deep greens through sheer pinks and fading blues . Another canvas was seen from the vantage point of Piette 's backyard : a peasant woman bundling a collection of faggots , a gaggle of geese coming up the road toward her . It was an autumnal scene , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes of the blue-roofed buildings of Piette 's farmhouse . He painted full-sized country people as part of the landscape in which they lived : at the well , carding wool , in the vein of the Fontainebleaupainters , setting down the monolithic stones in their forests . When winter struck he did snow effects : the icy blue , the nakedly stripped trees , the fluffy white comforter that covered the earth and its outgrowths in a dramatic sleep . For the first weeks he was comfortable as a guest , dropping his few remaining coins into Adele 's teapot on the shelf beside the big black stove . When he ran out of money he felt uneasy . His pride was never a swiftly surmounted obstacle . There was no one who would buy deep in this countryside far from Paris . He was not certain that his genre scenes were going well ; but he was convinced that to remain here , isolated , would be creating in a vacuum . When he told Julie that they would have to return home , her face fell . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try to put together another exhibition of our Independents . " " Surely you would n't leave us alone for la fete de Noel ? " Adele asked when she heard.  | " No , I could n't do that . " He was humble in the face of their pleading . " I 'll go out and paint the snow until it melts . " He did . Achieving a startling result by juxtaposing white upon layers of color with short impetuous strokes , creating a luminescent blanket of snow . When the weather was too howling to work out of doors he made a painting of Adele 's kitchen , a portrait of Madame Presle , a neighbor , in oil and gouache . Their days were made brighter by a note from Duret telling Camille that he had bought another Pontoise landscapeand would be forwarding the check as soon as his end-of-theyearaccounts were paid up . On December i i Camille wrote to Theodore Duret : " I sent to Martin'sgallery the little picture Guardian of the Cows with the request to give it to you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am now asking you , if anyway it 's not too inconvenient , to please send me in a registered letter twenty dollars , the price of the picture , as I will be caught short for the transportation of the entire family . You will be helping me out . . . . " I began with figures and animals . I have several projects for picturesof the genre . I am timidly casting myself into this branch of art , so illustrated by artists of the first rank . It 's really audacious . I fear making a complete mess . " I shake hands cordially . " Next , he learned that at a membership meeting at the end of 1874 in Renoir 's studio at 35 Rue St. Georges the members of the Societe Anonyme Cooperative des Artistes , Peintres , Sculpteurs , Graveurs were told that with liabilities of three thousand seven hundred and thirteen francs and cash on hand amounting to two hundred and seventy-eight francs , each exhibitor owed the Societe about twenty-five dollars , which only a few of them could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed Renoir and Sisley to supervise the process . Somehow the news brought Camille to the final depth of his despair . Plunging into the woods behind Piette 's home , he felt as though he were falling into an ocean in which he had only an instant to review his life before drowning . He was now forty-four years old . After almost three years of a false dawn , a time of acceptance and livelihood , he had been cast into a pit filled with venomous snakes of rejection . All the optimism was gone . Manet had been right ; Guillemet ; Piette ; Duret , on his frantic visit to Pontoise in an attempt to rescue him from the benighted adventure.  |p393He  was back where he had started , at his first showing at the Salon in 1859 , fifteen years before , with little more chance of making a living than he had had then . Perhaps less , because he had failed his best opportunity . The familial mood held over for the month of January . But that , he knew , must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife and three children . He could raise them as Mayennes , drive them in the buggy each morning to the countryside school . It was a concept that had for him the connotation of retiring to a monastery ; he was not ready to withdraw from the world . He knew that by returning to Pontoise and Paris he was re-entering a battle zone during a war that was going badly . Ultimately , though , the forces of the opposition had to be joined , the result fought out . The Russians had defeated Napoleon by retreating , but there could be no retreat for him . Four years before he had fled to London to escape the ravages of the Franco-Prussian War . This time there was nowhere to run , except back to the barricades . To remain in this pleasant vacuum was to be annihilated . After putting aside a month 's rent out of Duret 's twenty dollars , they returned to the Hermitage . On his first trip into Paris , with two Montfoucault canvases under his arm , he was walking through Montmartre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveled for the base of the vast Sacre Coeur basilica , when he entered a one-block impasse connecting the Rue des Martyrs and the Rue Henri Monnier . On one side was a row of narrow shops above which were floors of apartments , white-shuttered ; and a primary school for young girls . On the other Camille saw a shop painted an outrageous cobalt blue . When he read the name TANGUY above the window he remembered the owner as a peddler who had tramped the woods of Fontainebleau with a pack of oil paints and brushes on his back , selling to the painters . He had met Tanguy at Mother Anthony 's Inn at Marlotte when he stayed there with Monet , Renoir and Sisley. 1'anguy stood behind a roughhewn counter , a little fellow with ap394pudgy face and the wistful mien of a tail-wagging puppy . He wore in all seasons a wide-brimmed straw hat which he pulled down to the level of his eyebrows . He had short arms , stubby hands , a left eye which opened twice as wide as his right . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectionate expression his homelinesswas appealing . They exchanged greetings . Tanguy explained that Versailles had exiled him for his work with the Communards after the Franco-PrussianWar . After narrowly escaping execution , and only being reprieved a month before , he had leased this shop when the firm which manufacturedthe tubes of paint moved to larger quarters . He had used his savings from the four years he had labored in exile . " May I see the two paintings you carry ? " Tanguy asked in a winsome voice . Camille showed him Countryside with Boulders and The Pond at Montfoucault . Tanguy fairly exploded with excitement ; it was as though a huge beam of light had been cast upon the wistful countenance . He mutteredinarticulately to himself , then began shouting his appraisal , a glob of foam forming at the corner of his mouth . " I want to buy them . They would brighten up my life . Alas , I have no money . We live behind the store . My wife cooks a big pot of leek and potato or fish soup every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . " Camille was touched by Tanguy 's show of delight . " Your window is mighty small . " " Big enough for the pictures without frames . " Camille exclaimed , " Let us put a moderate price on the paintings . If you sell you keep half . Against them , you will give me credit for colors and brushes . " " As far as I 'm able . What do you need ? " Camille picked out tubes of sap green , flake white , yellow lake , Mars orange , containing himself with difficulty . Now he could go back to work in earnest , resume painting the biography of the Hermitage , Pontoise and the valley of the Oise . While Tanguy was wrapping the tubes in newspaper , Madame Tanguy came through the parting of a floor-length cloth curtain ; she was dressed in a gray-checked apron tied around her waist and ending at her shoe tops . She stepped between the two men , put out an arm to defend the already wrapped merchandise , turned to Camille and ran her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have n't money , Madame Tanguy . I 've left my two paintings for sale as security . " " Security ! What kind of security ? Who 's going to buy them ? For that matter , who 's going to sell them ? Tanguy 's no dealer . How is he to pay for all that paint ? " Madame Tanguy was a gritty little countrywoman with an angular face and a fiercely protective expression ; a bony survivor who had been condemned by her husband to a life of idealism . It was she who had saved the money in exile to open this shop ; a resolute creature slaving out her life to keep her husband alive on a stormy commercial sea . Anton Melbye would have painted her on the bridge of a rusty freighter in imminent danger of running aground . Tanguy expostulated gently . " Now , Maman , we have credit with the manufacturers . " " For how long , if we do n't pay ? " " Since we get credit we can extend it to Monsieur Pissarro . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first . " " Maman , go back into the kitchen . The soup will burn . " " If you give more credit there wo n't be any soup to burn . " She let loose one last salvo . " You stupid artists . Share and share alike . Your creditors are not socialists , they are capitalists . They insist on being paid . You work for years to open a little shop , and now you want to give everything away . Tu to mets clans la gueule du loop . " Tanguy said apologetically : " She 's right , of course . We put ourselves into the wolf 's jaw . I have no business sense . I 'll tell her I own your two pictures . It wo n't mollify her but it will sound more like a business deal . " " I dislike being the cause of a quarrel . " Tanguy had a beatific smile on his homely face . " A squall . It will pass . I will sell something for cash this afternoon . Madame Tanguy goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of supplies , come at that hour . Bring more canvases . " At the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes he heard that Berthe Morisot had married Edouard Manet 's brother Eugene . Since Edouard was devoted to his longtime wife and son , as well as to his beautiful mistress , how else was she to maintain a permanent place in her master 's life ? Camilleconsidered this a canard . Lunching at the Morisot home with Berthe and Eugene , he had seen how close and sympatico was their relationship . Eugene was a strong , handsome man , educated , stablep396and wealthy . Both he and Berthe came from the same well-bred , culturedstratum of society . If Eugene looked so much like Edouard that in a sense she was marrying the two brothers in one , that did not constitute bigamy . He also learned that on January 20 , while they were in Montfoucault , Millet had died . Camille had never met him but admired his drawing . As a tribute to his passing he did a replica of Millet 's peasants working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1874 Salon . Aging , and very ill , he had expected to receive the gold medal . He received a scant three votes , while Gerome , a plodding realist workhorse , was awarded the prize . Outraged , the art world of Paris under the leadership of Marotte , friends of Ingres and Delacroix , had commissionedthe sculptor Geoffroy Dechaume to create an all-Paris medal to be awarded to Corot at Durand-Ruel 's gallery in the Rue Le Peletier on December 27 , at a presentation ceremony . Camille had not lost his affection for Papa Corot , respect for his work , or gratitude for his tutoring . He never understood why Corot had cast him off ; did not friendship go beyond differences in tech-nique ? The gallery had been packed with Corot 's admirers . Corot had cried with emotion : " I must go , I know . I have known health for seventy-eight years , and the love of nature and of painting . My family were fine people ; I have enjoyed good friends and the belief that I have injured no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope with all my heart there will be painting in heaven . " Jean Baptiste Corot died on February 22 , 1875 . Although there was not a whisper of a second showing of the Independents , which they preferred to call themselves , Renoir , Monet and Sisley , all as hard pressed as Camille , had organized an auction to be held at the Hotel Drouot on March 24 . Berthe Morisot had agreed to join the auction out of loyalty to her comrades . The steadfast DurandRuel , already mortally wounded by his Impressionist proteges , volunteered to conduct the sale , taking little for his services . The group had assembled seventy-two paintings , twenty-one by Sisley , twenty by Monet , nineteen by Renoir , twelve by Morisot . The friendly critic Philippe Burty had written an introduction to the catalogue , pleading that these Refuses from the Salon warranted serious attention and discussion.  |p397When  Monet asked Camille to join them , he unhappily had to refuse . He simply did not have the francs it would take . But he was at the Hotel Drouot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the official art circles were there ; the hall was jammed with a gesticulating , noisy crowd . Camille wondered if that could be a good omen . It was not . From the first offering of a Monet painting from Argenteuil , a Sisley from Louveciennes and a Renoir ballet rehearsal scene , pandemonium reigned . It was an echo of the Societe Anonyme showing . The public had come to hoot , to jeer , to harass the auctioneer . The Arosa brothers , Faure , Duret , Dr. Paul Gachet offered serious bids . This only inflamed the crowd . Arguments arose , fists were brandished . The auctioneer , with Durand-Ruel 's consent , sent for the police to quiet what had become a riot . Camille sat with his head down , feeling shame . Not about the unspeakableconduct of what had become once again a mindless mob ; but about himself . If his confreres were abused and their paintings beaten down in contempt he should somehow have been with them . He had broken ranks . At that moment he decided that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would organize a second exhibitionfor the following year ; and persevere until they were established . Although Berthe Morisot needed the money the least , she managed an average of fifty dollars for a few of her pastels and watercolors . Monet gained forty-seven dollars each for several of his paintings ; Sisley twenty-two dollars . Renoir sold a Pont Neuf for an acceptable price of sixty dollars , but ten of his canvases had to be bought back by Durand-Ruel because the prices were under twenty dollars . The averageprice paid at the auction was thirty-two dollars , a quarter of the price for which Durand-Ruel had sold them in the prosperous years . Camille dragged himself to the Gare St. Lazare and was somber all the way to Pontoise . The road he envisaged , as the early spring countrysideof the Oise Valley sped by unviewed , would be longer and harder than any he or the others had conceived of . But it was the only road they had.  |p398By  the end of April he was down to his last franc . Julie 's supplies of flour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her vegetables were just showing an iceberg top of green . He had three sons to feed ; the landlord wanted his rent . No one came to see his paintings in the tiny room in the Rue Berthe which he still kept in hopes of attracting buyers . He would have to pack carefully half a dozen of his new canvases , take them into Paris and hawk them among his few possible " amateurs , " a nonpejorative term used by painters to describe collectors . He felt a sense of urgency . The only money to come in was ten dollars from Duret in late March , accompanied by a note which read : " Excuse the small amount , but I find myself at the end of this month with all sorts of debts accumulated which leave me short . " When Camille stopped briefly at Renoir 's studio , Renoir told him just before dashing out : " I must have eight dollars by noon , and all I have is sixty cents . " Monet had written to Edouard Manet , who was fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since day before yesterday , not a cent left and no more credit , neither at the butcher nor the baker . Although I have faith in the future , you see that the present is very painful . . . . Could you not possibly send me by return mail a twentyfrancnote ? That would help me for a quarter of an hour . " Camille continued his rounds ; not even his most ardent collectors felt they could spare any money for still one more Pissarro painting . They said kindly : " You 're at the top of your form . But we 'll have to wait until money eases up . " Having no coins for the buses , he was on foot all day , drenched and soggy-shoed in the early spring rains . He spent a full week trudging the streets , trying the newest and smallest galleries , the list of prospects afforded by Durand-Ruel . Nothing . He slept at his mother 's , arriving late , leaving early . She asked him to come for dinner either at midday or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was destitute . Rachel was now eighty , growing gnarled and silent . If she perceived how exhausted and beaten he looked , she gave no sign . She had withdrawn from the contest her son had been determined to wage.  |p399By  the end of the week he had lost weight , begun to look haggard . He continued to tramp the streets , canvases lashed to his back , hoping for a release from his humiliation and anguish . He could not go back to Pontoise empty-handed , face the near desperation in Julie 's eyes . He was trudging past a government building when he recognized a customs official , Victor Chocquet , to whom he had spoken at the Hotel Drouot debacle just a few weeks before . Chocquet , on his limited salary , for years had been collecting Delacroix and Courbet . At the Hotel Drouot auction Chocquet had said : " I fully intended to go to your Impressionist show and buy something . Your work , and all the others ' , fascinates me . But at that time a friend dissuaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time by buying a Renoir , a Sisley , a Monet . " Come , we 'll have a meal at my regular restaurant , " he exclaimed . " We 'll take a corner table and you can show me the paintings you 're carrying . " Victor Chocquet had a well-groomed head of streaked silver hair with wide-open appreciative eyes , a gentle civilized face with a neat gray beard . After he had ordered without consulting the menu , he studied Camille 's paintings , two from the pond and fields around Montfoucault , two from the Hermitage houses and gardens , two from the fields around Pontoise . Camille watched his eyes as they brightened . " Beautiful . They stir me deeply . I have a sense of utter calm , as though something divine had entered my bureaucratic life . It 's hard to choose but I think I like this one best . May I buy it ? What is the price ? " Camille 's thoughts scrambled inside his head . Some of Renoir 's paintings had been bid at less than ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty dollars . Chocquet had been there ; he knew what the prices had been . At auction his own pictures would have brought as little , or less . But this was not an auction . How could he , desperate as he was , let a major painting go for less than Durand-Ruel had paid him at his first buy in the London gallery ? " Forty dollars ? " he said tentatively . " I 'll take it , " said Chocquet . Camille permitted himself an enormous sigh of relief . Julie 's kitchen bins were replenished . Once again the landlord was paid two months ' rent . The next time he was in Paris Camille placated Madame Tanguy with a modest amount of cash against his account . . . then left with more supplies . Once again he ate of , Julie 's plain cooking . She had prepared rabbitp400in every way she knew how ; he did not dare confess that he could barely face it again . He put back some weight , went to work with a renewed passion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and summer beauty . His subtle yet strong colors , his brushwork , the architectural structure he insisted on , the choice of subject were largely new to his creative mind and palette . Durand-Ruel did not spend his limited purse of praise liberally . When he had inspected the latest oils , ranging from twenty-five by thirty inches to forty-five by sixty , he exclaimed with an expressive gesture that covered his breast with outstretched fingers : " Pissarro , my friend , these paintings are as beautiful as any you have done . They should sell . " Camille thought , " But how do I find the collectors to buy them ? " Chocquet 's money was used up . How did he pay the next month 's rent , buy the nux vomica for Lucien 's cough and the belladonna so that Julie could breathe at night ? He endured the staggering heat of the Parisian sidewalks ; the closed shutters of the stores and apartments for the month 's vacance , walking miles every day in suffocating airlessness , perspiration flowing down his face ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pack of paintings on his back as heavy as a guilty conscience . Would they like something for their walls ? The proprietors turned away ; nobody bought anything in August when customers were few . Exhausted , sleepless , he capitulated to Rachel 's request that he bathe in her big tub , then have supper . At the end of the second week , having sold nothing , leaving the paintings in the studio apartment , he used the last of his coins for a third-class ticket to Pontoise . He had written to Julie confessing his failure so she was not too shocked at his frustrated expression . Alone and forlorn at her kitchen table , her apron over her head to conceal her anguish , she demanded , half aloud : " What do we do now ? " If ever Camille was tempted to believe in God , his own Yahweh or Julie 's Lord Jesus , it was at the end of August when Edgar Degas arrived on the doorstep of 18 bis on a Sunday afternoon with two ladies in tow , Mary Cassatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a young friend of Miss Cassatt 's , Louise Elder , nineteen years old , who had completed her course at a finishing school in France . Mary Cassatt had long held Degas 's painting in esteem . They had met at ap401dinner party ; and for some inexplicable reason Miss Cassatt , now thirty-one years old , of a wealthy , world-traveling Philadelphia family , though born in Pittsburgh , had dissolved Degas 's fear of a personal relationship with a woman . They had become friends , with Degas accepting Miss Cassatt as his pupil while refusing to admit he was her master . Hard as he tried to conceal his feelings , it was obvious that he enjoyed Miss Cassatt 's company . Camille exclaimed his surprise and pleasure at seeing the three beaming faces before him . Degas explained that Louise Elder was an art enthusiast who had been introduced to the group by the admiring Miss Cassatt . He added mockingly : " This story is self-aggrandizing but will explain our visit . Back in 1873 Miss Cassatt and her friend saw in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballet Rehearsal . Miss Elder rushed into the gallery and spent her full month 's allowance , one hundred dollars , to buy the picture . She also bought a Monet at our exhibition last year . Now Miss Cassatt has suggested that she is ready to acquire a Pissarro . " " Oh yes , I am , " Miss Elder cried in a surprisingly mature voice . " I admired your work at Nadar 's , Monsieur Pissarro , but I did not know enough to buy one . " Camille sent Lucien with a message to Julie to dress in her Sunday best and to prepare coffee for the guests , then led them across the yard to the small shed he used as a studio . Once in the little room , Degas took it upon himself to show the women Camille 's paintings and explainsomething about the technique . It was good of him to give his wicked tongue a Sunday off and devote a day to bringing a prospective buyer out to Pontoise . In an aside he also told Camille that he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he considered she was on the same road as he . Miss Cassatt 's first love was Degas 's work ; she was also an enthusiast of Camille 's , which enabled them all to be forthcoming as they stood in the sunlight of the late summer afternoon . Though not a portraitist , Camille 's eyes broke down a person'sface and figure into the elements of painting : color , planes , relation of parts to the whole . Mary Cassatt was wearing a white dress down to the floor , over a mild bustle ; a poke bonnet with red flowers . She was a tallish woman with a wreath of light blond hair combed behind her ears , a robustly modeled bosom , a slender waist and what appeared to Camille to he long slender legs under the all-encompassingdress that was the custom of the day . Her eyes were small but intensely alive in a slender oval and a flawlessly smooth skin . Herp402expression was one of eager learning despite the fact that she had shown in four successive Salons . Along with it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called her beautiful ; but she had the poised charm of a doer . She told him quite openly that her father had made a great deal of money from real estate , retired early and taken his family on a long trek through Europe . She had studied for four years at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts until she was twenty-one , returned to Philadelphiaduring the Franco-Prussian War , then settled permanently in Paris . Her father declared that " women were deficient in good sense , " yet he had enough respect for his daughter 's judgment to allow her to live alone in Paris on a liberal allowance . Camille found it ironic that Mary Cassatt had chosen as her mentor a man who had as little tolerance for women as it appeared her own father had had . It was also interesting that Degas never painted men . His ballet dancers , laundresses , modistes were all women . Mary Cassatt painted no men . " I prefer children , and mothers with children . Or women drinking tea , bathing , combing their hair , sewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My hand freezes when I try to portray a male , though I have brothers whom I love . I was an admirer of Courbet , then I met the work of Edouard Manet and Edgar Degas 's fabulous new pastel colors , and I began to live . I 'm finishing a young bride but it 's after Correg-gio . " Degas was angry at his father for his father 's treatment of his mother . Why did Mary Cassatt find the male unpaintable ? She also declared that painting was her life . She would never marry . Louise Elder selected her painting with an assist from Degas , Houses and Gardens of the Hermitage . She could hardly contain her delight . She said tremulously : " Oh dear , I do hope I can afford it . I have only my monthly allowance . How much would it be , Monsieur Pissarro ? " As always , Camille was hesitant . He had asked forty dollars from Chocquet but this painting was larger . Before the 1874 Independents ' exhibition and the collapse of prices at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his best canvases . He needed the money more desperately now and he was afraid of losing the sale . Before he could answer , Mary Cassatt took over the proceedings . " Louise , two years ago you paid one hundred dollars for the Degas painting . I do n't see any reason why you should n't pay the same sum for this exquisite Pissarro. "  |p403Louise  Elder opened her lips in a gesture of relief and acceptance . " I expected to pay that much . " She opened her small embroidered pouch and handed Camille one hundred dollars in crisp notes . His head swam . He saw himself buying Julie a dress and the boys stout winter shoes . " Our lives are a merry-go-round , " he told Julie when helping her clear the coffee cups and cake dishes from the dining-room table . " A continuous round of poverty and plenty . Or should I call it a toboggan ? On top of the snowy mountain at one moment , then down in the slush at the bottom in another . " Julie could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be this way ? " " Apparently . " Paul Cezanne had returned to Paris in the spring of 1875 with Hortenseand his son , bringing his family to Pontoise to visit . Cezanne 's father had raised his thirty-six-year-old son 's allowance a trifle ; he still did not know that Cezanne had a mistress or a son . Once again they painted side by side , always learning from each other 's intuitive approach to light and the feel of the earth as the light changed . For a time they experimented with their palette knives in an effort to achieve a particularly thick application of paint but quickly abandoned the idea because the impasto was alien to their gradation of color . Gathered about the dinner table , Cezanne was flattered by the pencil portrait Camille had done of him that day , though to Julie it appeared pugnacious , the head set defensively deep into the shoulders . Cezanne said , not for the first time : " Why not come to Aix-en-Provence this winter ? We could paint in the sun . " Camille replied hesitantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The light here in the Oise Valley fits my temperament . " However he accepted Claude Monet 's invitation to come with Julie to Argenteuil for a visit and a painting spree . . . and to bring along some baskets of food . He arranged with Felicie to stay in Pontoise with her laughter and take care of their bows ; then wrote to Duret to payp404Madame Latouche , wife of a painter who earned part of their living selling supplies , ten dollars for canvas he had purchased . Edouard Manet was also staying with the Monets , as was Renoir . Seeing Camille 's surprise at his being there , Manet commented in his cultivated way : " You thought I deserted you last year . It 's not true . I 'm still a member of the Batignolles group . I think you are all painting better , with a verve and fresher outlook than anyone showing in the Salon . It 's just that I think the Salon is the right milieu for me , bastards as those jury members may be . That should n't put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not extend to Renoir , whose choice of subjects he considered mundane and liked as little as he did his technique . When he had Camille and Monet alone he murmured : " You who are close with Renoir , you ought to advise him to turn to something else . You can see that painting is not for him ! " Camille and Monet defended Renoir 's portraits , many of them fleshy nudes , and his recent landscapes , which used blue , green and ivory as structural colors , the drawing fluid with broad contrasting areas of light and dark ; a balanced vision of Renoir 's personality . Gustave Caillebotte 's family home was nearby . He was helping Monetbuild a studio boat similar to Daubigny 's , a shelter over the large part of an old skiff , so that Monet could paint the river in all its aspects . Caillebotte was also providing the materials for the bankrupt Monet , who was painting as omnivorously as though he were a Rothschild . " It 's the light I want to capture more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already heard that Monet was so fascinated with capturingthe changing effects of light that he was beginning to lose the objects that were bathed in it . Unlike Cezanne , who that fall in Pontoise had remarked , " I 'm not interested in a fleeting impression of light . I 'm seeking basic structure . How much solidity of earth underlies the surface ? How far down does the earth go ? How does it affect the surface ? " Camille 's main objective in coming to Argenteuil was to introduce the idea of a second showing of the Independents the following April before the official 1876 Salon opened . They had missed 1875 because their hides were still black and blue . He felt that if they waited longer they would be forgotten , even in their obloquy . He was convinced that their only hope was to continue the exhibitions , year after year , slowlyp405obliterating the public 's sense of shock and waiting for their most venomous critics to die off . " Because they do , you know , " he observed to Caillebotte , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or they resign , or get fired , or find no clients to buy their reviews , leaving behind only an acrid odor while the works of art remain . " Caillebotte poured him a glass of port . He was still in his late twenties , unmarried , his cheeks flushed , moving quickly with powerful arms and chest . His longtime mistress , Charlotte Berthier , was hostess of the villa , Petit Gennevilliers , and ran it competently . Caillebotte liked to entertain both his professional and bohemian friends , mixing them casually since he was attached to both camps . She got along with the women of the industrialists and the painters . Her languid manner amused them . " We had very poor seats for the opening of The Power of Darkness , " she said . " Was n't that lucky ? The play bored us to death . " " I 'm in total agreement with you about the necessity to show next spring , " Caillebotte said across the round mahogany table . " I would like to exhibit too , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paintings before supper . His work was a composite , for he had learned a little something from each of the group , particularly Monet ; yet it had the stamp of his individuality as an engineer . In his Square in Argenteuil the trees were rigid yet the coloring and intensity of shadow showed talent . Monet and Renoir agreed that they would exhibit , in fact Monet had said , " I 'm so desperate to exhibit I 'd show in a bordello . " But neither man was willing to put in the hours or effort needed to organize the affair . Degas offered to help , as would Caillebotte , perhaps one or two others . They would need a gallery which the public respected . Nadar 's studios had carried no prestige . " We 're referring to Durand-Ruel 's gallery , of course , " said Camille . " But has n't he suffered enough for us ? " Paul Durand-Ruel still dressed in a bat-wing collar and black cravat , but he had lost his ebullience . He listened gravely , pacing the gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Fontainebleau paintings which no one could presently afford , the economy continuing to worsen , the Bourse staggering . He was behind in his rent . " The only reason the landlord does n't put me out , " he explained , " is that there is no conceivable tenant to take my place . "  |p406After  a few moments he responded : " Perhaps the old adage is right . If one is going to be hanged it may as well be for murder as petty theft . The second Impressionist show shall be in my gallery . " The winter was a harsh one yet Camille went out to paint in the rain and snow , a little bridge in a deep forest , a corner of the village , the hillsides of Jallais from a new angle . All of the Independents were working steadily . Louise Elder 's hundred dollars disappeared into the maw of necessity . Pere Tanguy was still giving him credit , manipulatingthe books so that his wife would not know that Camille Pissarro now owed him several hundred dollars . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soles of his wornout shoes flapping loose in the wet gutters , he sold nothing . There appeared to be no new amateurs to be discovered ; his regular collectors had their walls filled , their pockets empty . In one gallery he was advised that , although there was no market for art , prosperous women were still buying the kind of fan that opened up to show a charming country or society scene . He could earn five dollars for each . " Why not ? " he demanded of himself . He had painted blinds . It was a pittance but it would put food in the mouths of his boys . He returned to Pontoise to paint , on a fan , a farm scene of Montfoucault , of which he had brought home sketches . It was bought at once ; he would do more . The stringency and harassment did Julie 's temperament no good . Camille felt the stinging blows of her wrath . He was educated , he was talented , he was disciplined ; then why could he not earn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did ? No one genuinely becomes accustomed to grinding poverty ; it sours thin soup , pervades one 's sleep . Yet Camille stubbornly held to the concept that the dedicated artist is not destroyed by deprivation , abuse or neglect ; only by an inner weakening of his own resolve . He did not count the individual days as they passed or mark off calendar dates toward a better future . The hours were a blanket under which they huddled . Not even in extreme want could he yield to Julie 's pleas that he ask help from his mother . He had learned that Alfred too was struggling , the shortage of money having seeped into the importexportbusiness . The family bond had vanished . Rachel had continued an occasional Sunday visit to see her grandchildren during their three years of prosperity . With a village girl in the house as a helper , Juliep407had managed to maintain a tenuous accord . With the collapse of Camille'saffluence , Rachel 's resigned indulgence vanished . From the back of her mind there re-emerged the concept that her son had ruined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never fallen into the gully of painting as a profession he would not have been attracted to her in the first place ; they were interlocking follies . When she criticized Julie 's housekeeping or raising of the children Julie endured it with a bottom-of-the-Rue-Neuve phlegm . Camille excused his mother 's behavioras the result of her age or illnesses , though she was using a cane for walking more as a prop than a necessity . Once she raised the cane as though to strike her daughter-in-law ; Camille took it from her , said quietly , " Maman , that will be quite enough . I 'll take you to the station and put you into a seat on the train . Perhaps when things get better you may want to visit again . It is not good for the children to see their grandmother want to hit their mother . " She had not been to Pontoise since . He sent her notes about the children , saw her in town when he had to remain in Paris , though he slept in the tiny exhibition room he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not his forte and abandonedthe attempt , returning to essence landscape , to an earlier admonitionof Duret : " Go your own way along your own path of rustic nature . " Caillebotte sent two of Camille 's paintings to an exhibition in Pau , in southern France . Nothing came of it . In Paris Camille learned that Antoine Guillemet , who had abandoned them completely , was selling from the Salon , winning honors , securing state commissions , well on his way to receiving the coveted Legion of Honor for paintings that the group considered had not progressed from the first they had seen seventeen years before . A month after the end of 1875 , on February 7 , he wrote to Theodore Duret : " I have n't been able to make enough this month to pay my rent in Paris . I am forced to call upon your good friendship : if it is possible for you to give me the thirty dollars that remains due on the pictures you bought from me . That would make me very happy . I will go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I have only this amount to call in . Unfortunately I do n't sell enough to live on . " Ile then turned his attention to the group 's exhibition at DurandRod 's . The only intimate they lost was Paul Cezanne . Camille was disappointed , for his faith in Cezanne never wavered . The rest werep408relieved , saying : " Cezanne 's painting elicits the most abusive criticism of all . " Caillebotte submitted two good scenes of the river at Argenteuil . A half dozen of the surrounding " foliage painters " from the first showing , painters the Society had hoped would mollify the critics , declined the invitation to repeat : Astruc , Bracquemond , Brandon , Colin , Latouche , several others . In their place they picked up competent conventionalists such as Legros , J. B. Millet , Francois , Cals , until they had accumulated a total of eighteen artists who contributed two hundred and fifty paintings . Renoir was exhibiting fifteen works , Monet eighteen , Degas twenty-four , Berthe Morisot seventeen , Sisley eight landscapes . Camille , busy organizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the main gallery before the opening he immediately sent a note to Camille in Pontoise , not knowing he was in Paris : " Monet has an exhibition overwhelming in number and size of the canvases . He overwhelms everybody except Renoir who occupies an entire panel next to him . You have only six canvases there , some of which are not intended to strike and impress the public and the bourgeois . " It seems to me that this exhibition is going to attract much attention and will be decisive for the enemy . You should come here , make a choice of your best canvases  --  at your collectors ' or elsewhere  --  and like Renoir and Monet arrange a grouping that will make an impression . You occupy too little space . " If you need any of the paintings belonging to me , they are at your disposition . But you must n't lose time . " Julie added a note when she forwarded the letter : " Duret is giving you good advice the future depends on it do as much as possible there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been remiss . He brought in three canvasesfrom Pontoise and the Hermitage , borrowed two older oils from Durand-Ruel and the one he had sold Chocquet . Durand-Ruel 's gallery was ablaze with color and light . The day before the show opened , arranging his twelve paintings in what to him was a meaningful design , he said to Durand-Ruel , whose own collection was in storage for the month : " You 're gambling on the same faction that hurt you so badly two years ago . " Durand-Ruel sighed  | " When I was a young man I deluded myself into thinking that there was a straight smooth road to success . There is n't . The road sometimessinks into deep valleys . Either you eke it out with your friends or you succumb to convenient solutions . To a man of my upbringing , loyalty makes better sense than opportunism . " Camille brought Julie to the opening . For the artists and for DurandRuelit was an even more exhilarating display than their show at Nadar 's two years before . " I wish I were Croesus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would buy them all . " The crowd that thronged in was also larger than the one of 1874 . Camille thought the derisive laughter a trifle less raucous . No fights broke out . The police did not have to be called as they had at the 1875 Hotel Drouot auction . Their few friends among the liberal journals again tried to explain what this new painting was about . The establishedpress was lethal , led by the authoritative Albert Wolff , who pronounced their death knell in Le Figaro : The Rue Le Peletier has bad luck . After the Opera fire , here is a new disaster overwhelming the district . At Durand-Ruel 's there has just opened an exhibition of so-called painting . . . five or six lunatics  --  among them a woman . It is a frightening spectacle of human vanity gone astray to the point of madness . Try to make Monsieur Pissarro understand that trees are not violet , that the sky is not the color of fresh butter , that in no country do we see the things he paints and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MonsieurDegas see reason ; tell him that in art there are certain qualities called drawing , color , execution , control . . . . Or try to explain to Monsieur Renoir that a woman 's torso is not a mass of flesh in the process of decomposition with green and violet spots which denote the state of complete putrefactionof a corpse ! . . . The exhibition , which lasted the month , had to be declared a failure , even by the romantics among the artists . Claude Monet had the one stroke of luck , he sold his , Japonnerie for four hundred dollars , a sum large enough to save him from eviction from his home in Argenteuil . Camille sold only one canvas ; for less than fifty dollars . Degas , Renoir , Berthe Morisot sold one each , but at prices that gave little profit over the cost of their frames.  |p410Had  their efforts again been wasted ? Gustave Caillebotte did not think so , even though he had given considerable time and money to mounting the show . He took Camille and Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good bottle of dry white wine . As they clinked glasses , Caillebotte said confidently : " You ca n't see any impression on the rock where the water is dripping ? That 's because the naked eye is limited in its vision . We will show next year , and the next and the next . Eventually the rock of opposition will be worn away . " Julie said under her breath : " So will I. " When the official Salon opened some weeks later , in the spring of 1876 , the critic Castagnary said of the Impressionists : . . . The younger artists have flung themselves into frank simplicity to a man and , without suspecting it , the crowd acknowledges that the innovators have the right on their side . . . . People who have been to Durand-Ruel 's , who have seen the landscapes , so true and so pulsating with life , which MessieursMonet , Pissarro and Sisley have produced , entertain no doubts as to that . Camille met Dr. Georges de Bellio , a highly qualified homeopathic physician , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related to the ruling dynasty of the Bibescos in his native country . He was a longtime resident of Paris and now practiced only for his friends and the artists he admired . Unlike the eccentric Dr. Paul Gachet , Dr. de Bellio was fastidiously garbed in a long black coat with wide lapels , matching waistcoat and trousers , his cravat tucked meticulously under a white collar . On the street he wore a round black hat like a parish priest 's . His apartment at 66 Rue des Martyrs was filled to suffocation with sculptures and paintings of all schools , antique furniture , a Dutch chandelier , Italian terracottas , Japanese bronzes . He had started his collection by buying two paintings out of the sale at Delacroix 's studio and as a frequenter of the Hotel Drouot auctions . He was now commit/ted to the Impressionists . In 1874 at the Society 's first exhibition , he had bought Monet 's ridiculed Impression : Sunrise , which had been savaged by the press . In 1875 he had bought a self-portrait of Renoir which Renoir had discarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had also purchased a Sisley . He hung the paintings wherever there was space . Now he began caring for the Pissarro family , bringing with him to Pontoise his homeopathic medicines and , like Dr. Gachet , taking a small painting in lieu of a fee . In the summer of 1876 Leonie Monet , the loveliest and most ebullientof all the painters ' wives or mistresses , became pregnant . Both Claude Monet and she feared that the future was too uncertain to support a second child ; they decided she would have an abortion . Abortion had been illegal in France since 181o , the law declaring , " The aborting of a pregnant woman will be punishable by solitary confinement . The same penalty shall be imposed against a woman who induces an abortion herself , or consents to methods recommended to her . Doctors , pharmacists who have administered these means will be condemned to hard labor . " The Monets were recommended to a local impostor without medical training . Leonie suffered a lacerated wall of the uterus which would not heal . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain . The local Argenteuil doctor saw no way of closing the wound short of a major operation . When the Pissarros learned that she could not get out of bed , they went to Argenteuil to comfort her . While Julie sat beside her friend , Monet walked Camille around and around their garden , disconsolate . " I am riddled with guilt , " he cried . " My life and little Jean 's revolve about Leonie . She is terrified of an operation . Besides , we have no money for the hospital or the surgeon . We are living from day to day by begging from my amateurs . " Camille pleaded with him to turn to Dr. de Bellio . Monet had feared to approach the man because of the illegal aspect of the problem . Dr. de Bellio came instantly to Argenteuil , passed no judgment , treated Leonie with homeopathic medicines . At the beginning of summer Camille found an even smaller , less expensive room on the Quai d'Anjou in which to store his paintings and display them . It was near the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Paris . Guillaumin offered to show the paintings to prospective buyers when Camille could not get into thep412city . However kind the offer , Guillaumin was unable to sell even one , and Camille soon gave up the room because he could not afford the insignificant rent . He worked with rigid self-discipline through the autumn and winter of 1876 , producing forty-three completed paintings . The orchards around Pontoise , pear trees in bloom , the streets , riverbanks , the quais in the rain , all with the vibrant colors of the changing seasons as he saw them : yellow-greens , roof-tile reds , filtered pinks and blues . His confrerestold him that the new canvases were intensely alive , profoundly true ; the kind that filled the bosom with a palpitant joy , awe and wonder at the creativity of the Maker . There was no one to buy . There were those who suggested that his country scenes of peasants and working farmyards could not be hung in the elegant drawing rooms of the collectors . They went deeper into debt . Julie scrounged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ward off the cold of the winter snows , enough warm clothing to let the older two continue school . Camille found a job in a kiln in nearby Osny painting ceramic tiles . Unlike the window blinds he had painted years before on salary , or the fans which had had a fixed fee , he now had to gamble . He got paid only when they were sold . He painted thirty to forty of them ; they brought in pennies . He hoped for a third exhibition of the Independents at the earliest possible moment of spring . In January Monet had moved back to Paris in an apartment at 26 Rue d'Edimbourg near the Gare St. Lazare . Leonie went occasionally to his small studio nearby on the Rue Moncey to model for him , though it was difficult for her . The worst of the discomfort had passed but full recuperation would take a long time . Camille could get no encouragement from Monet for a third exhibition . The group was averse to taking still another beating for minuscularsales . Only Caillebotte emphasized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition . Durand-Ruel had had to lease out part of his showroom ; they would have to find an empty apartment in a good location . " How will we pay for it ? " the others asked . " No one is earning except Renoir , who has a commission to paint the publisher Charpentierand his wife and young daughter . " Caillebotte located a spacious second-floor apartment at 6 Rue Le Peletier , on the site of the opera house that had burned down . He and Degas would pay the rent . With a place to show , with Caillebotte and Camille arranging for a catalogue , the seven painters who formed thep413core of the Impressionists responded with renewed enthusiasm and a plethora of canvases . Cezanne and Guillaumin returned , after having abstained for a year . Boudin declined . Camille added Piette ; Renoir invited his friends Frank Lamy and Cordey , good Salon artists . Degas brought his friends Maureau and Tillot , conventional painters with small galleries to represent their academic work . They ended with eighteen artists and the largest exhibition of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Auvers-sur-Oise ; three lent by Caillebotte . Cezanne had several landscapes , three still lifes , a portrait of Chocquet , three watercolors . Degasshowed twenty-five paintings , pastels , scenes from the opera , ballet , cafe concerts , women at their ablutions . Monet had thirty paintings , eight of the Care St. Lazare , landscapes , eleven of which were lent by Hoschede and three by Dr. de Bellio . Renoir had twenty , including his fine and remunerative portrait of Madame Charpentier and her young daughter . Sisley had seventeen landscapes , including Flood at Marly ; three were lent by Hoschede , three by Dr. de Bellio . The hanging committee was dominated by Monet and Renoir . This time it was Piette who cried out in a throttled rage that Camille must come into Paris immediately and reorganize the hanging . That Monet and Renoir had usurped the best rooms for themselves . Camille went into Paris , routed out Caillebotte from his naval architecturaloffice ; together they went to the Rue Le Peletier and rehung the show so that everyone had equally important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day before the opening Camille went through the exhibition alone , at noon , and saw what he considered to be the most thrilling display of painting in French history . For him there was glory in it , an explosive new vision of life on earth . The display was so overwhelming , so monumental in its scope of revitalized , life-giving painting that there was no way for him to believe that it would not be a resounding success . It was now three years since their first presentation at Nadar 's ; the public had had ample time to be re-educated , their vision cleared for this leap ahead in every aspect of putting paint on canvas . They had carried forward the revolutions of Corot and Daubigny , the tradition of Delacroix and Courbet to an illustrious fulfillment . It could not fail . Never had one apartment anywhere in the world been filled with so inspired a flame ; color-riotous , incredibly fresh , rich , daringly avant garde irr its atmospheric light , its new content : musicians , ballets , racetracks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital world , all barriers broken by the brilliance of what Caillebottecalled " The Intransigents . " The place sang with hosannahs for the earth and its fruits , man and the products of his character and talent . Opening day brought the usual large crowd . As the viewers entered the first room they saw pictures of Monet , Renoir and Gaillebotte . In the second room were two of Camille 's landscapes , scenes by Sisley and Guillaumin . Cezanne and Berthe Morisot were each given a wall of the big drawing room in the middle of the apartment , along with a large Pissarro landscape and Renoir 's Dancing at the Moulin de la Galette . Cezanne 's fellow Impressionists were beginning to agree with Camille that Cezanne had a startling talent . The dining room was shared by Camille , Caillebotte , Monet , Sisley and many of the other painters because of its large area of wall . A gallery at the end of the apartment was completely Degas 's , which was the way he had wanted it for concentratedviewing . Theodore Duret , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed with the visitors . Though the rooms were filled with derisive laughter , he told Camille : " The majority of the visitors are of the opinion that the exhibiting artists are perhaps not devoid of talent and they might have executed good pictures if they had been willing to paint like the rest of the world ; but that above all they were trying to create a rumpus to stir up the crowd . " Camille too detected less hatred , less bitterness than at the former exhibitions . There were few inflamed arguments , no red-faced vitriol or ridicule . Yet he perceived that the lack of hostility was for the wrong reason : not because the exhibit was any less a revolution in man 's way of looking at the world but because the painters were now seen as harmless buffoons whose sole purpose was to afford amusement . During the month of the exhibition the group published a small art journal called L'Impressionniste , largely written by a sympathetic critic , Georges Riviere , which explained and extolled what the Impressionistswere trying to accomplish . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disciple of the superb cartoonist Daumier , published anamusing caricature in Le Charivari . Under the sign : EXPOSITION DES PEINTRES IMPRESSIONNISTES , a gendarme was forcibly restraining ap415well-dressed , pregnant young woman : " Madame , it would be unwise to enter ! " Another critic wrote : Stand the painting up , it 's a boat on the Seine ; turn it upside down and it 's an orchard with a plowman . The ultimate blow was given by Paul Mantz in the prestigious LeTemps : . . . They keep their eyes closed , their hand is heavy , they show a superb disdain for execution . There is no need to discuss these visionary spirits who imagine that their carelessnessmight be taken for grace and their impotence for candor . There is no reason to fear that ignorance will ever become a virtue . Camille exclaimed over coffee at the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes : " If these critics are right we are worthless . If they are wrong , art criticism is dead . " Several thousand people thronged into 6 Rue Le Peletier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the Impressionists were now a cause celebre . It was better than a farce at the Comedie Francaise . They sold a few small still lifes by the Salon painters . The Impressionistscame out empty-handed . Durand-Ruel sent them a summons to come to his apartment on the Rue Lafayette for a conference . He had managed to keep his apartment , though it seemed barren ; he had been obliged to sell off so many of the Fontainebleau paintings , the Meissen , Dresden , Spode , objets d'art he and his wife had collected for years . Aging Aunt Louise served them a cold buffet . Durand-Ruel stood before the empty mantel of the fireplace . " I 've called you here to suggest that you hold a public auction at the I-16tel Drouot when the exhibition closes . You can not walk away from this endeavor without some canvases being sold . I have arranged with an associate , Legrand , to conduct it . " There was instantaneous and stormy dissent . Berthe Morisot said , " It will be a failure , as the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had humiliation enough for one season . " " I know all that , " Durand-Ruel replied grimly . " You may get back wily the price of ' your frames . But that is better than trundling two hundred paintings home through the streets on carts . "  |p416There  was an uneasy silence . Camille felt a hollow at the pit of his stomach . " I 'll put up my work , " said Caillebotte , which turned the argument around ; everyone knew that Caillebotte did not need the money . Forty-five paintings survived for the auction ; the others were withdrawn . The Hotel Drouot sent out its announcement and a large audience assembled . . . to scoff as each painting was put up in turn . Yet again there was a difference . Instead of being reviled as enemies of the people , the paintings had graduated into the realm of harmless nonsense . Nevertheless Camille sold Spring at Close for twenty-one dollars ; Harvesters Resting for twenty-six ; Footpath for forty ; Pear Tree in Flower for forty-six , Great Pear Tree at Montfoucault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Renoir 's paintings brought between ten and fifty-seven dollars each ; Sisley 's between eleven and thirty-three . Caillebotte secured the highestprices for his quieter canvases . There were few new collectors . Most of the paintings were sold to adherents : Dr. de Bellio , Dr. Gachet , Duret , the Arosa brothers , Chocquet , Faure , Charpentier , the book publisher , the stockbrokers Ernest May and Paul Gauguin . Most of the pictures brought in only their cost , the average price bid being thirtyfourdollars . Yet Legrand , by outmaneuvering the obstructionist crowd , managed to take in a total of fifteen hundred and twenty dollars . The Hotel Drouot collected its percentage , but even so , the five painters took home cash instead of canvases . Caillebotte used his auction money against the rent and journal expenses ; neither he nor Degas asked the others to make up the balance . The one prize the Impressionists got out of their third exhibition was a play by Halevy called The Grasshopper , which satirized an Impressionist . Sitting in the rattling train home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before : " I 'm proud to be satirized in a successful revue . It means I 've arrived , that all Paris is talking about me. "  |p417Des|pite  the fact that he had given each of the Pontoise merchants a few dollars and paid his landlord for back rent , by June their patience was exhausted . For the first time in all his years of hardship , Camille , at forty-seven , was threatened with bankruptcy . His creditors insisted they would seize his assets , including the furniture and all of the paintings from his studio . His landlord told him he would have to vacate by the end of the month ; he had another renter who could pay steadily . To add to their distress , Lucien became ill and the youngest , Felix , developed a cold and fever . Camille would have to go back to poundingthe streets of Paris , though he was hesitant to approach the regularswho had supported the auction . Julie 's woebegone eyes were message enough . When he returned to Pontoise after five days , exhausted , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forth searching for some bits of twenty dollars , uselessly . He had not been able to locate Caillebotte in either Paris or Argenteuil . Camille wrote him a note , asking him to come out to the Hermitage on a matter of urgency . Caillebotte arrived a couple of days before the Pissarro expulsion . He wore an expression of concern . " My dear friend , what is it ? " Camille tried to keep his voice steady and to avoid any note of pathos as he outlined his delinquencies . Caillebotte listened carefully , then asked : " What will it take to pay all your debts and leave you something to tide you over the summer ? " " I 've added it up . Two hundred dollars . " They were in Camille 's rough-stone room across the carriage path . Caillebotte shifted from one foot to the other , ran his fingers through his hair . Then a tiny smile twitched his lips. " 1 can handle it . " Camille threw both arms around the big , mild-mannered man , trying to fight hack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will give you pleasure . "  | " Certainement ! This is a purchase agreement . Show me the two paintingsyou think you will have the most difficulty selling . " He chose Winter at Montfoucau , lt and a brilliantly hued Sunset Effect , Pontoise . Julie hurried to the patisserie in town for cakes , which she served in the tiny area set aside for eating . Camille had put Caillebotte'sbank draft for two hundred dollars in the left-hand pocket of his shirt where he could feel it spreading warmth over his heart . Julie had difficulty restraining herself from an embarrassing profusion of gratitude . Drinking his coffee , Caillebotte said : " I 've been thinking about the future of our Independent exhibitions . It 's going to be difficult to raise money for the next one . So I 've completed a will . " Camille cried : " Sacrebleu ! You 're only twenty-eight . " Julie rejoined : " God sets our time on earth . " Caillebotte went on quietly : " I have no desire to die . I enjoy designing boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just that if I should die suddenly I want my collection to go to the state with a request that they be hung in the Louvre . " " The Louvre ? We ca n't even get into the Salon . Your will is going to get drenched in a hailstorm of opposition . " Caillebotte handed Camille a sheet of paper covered with Caillebotte'sneat hand . Camille read : I desire that from my estate the necessary sum be taken to arrange in 1878 , under the best possible conditions , an exhibitionof the painters who are called Les Iretransigeants or Les Impressionnistes . It is rather difficult for me to fix that sum now ; it may amount to thirty or forty thousand francs , or even more . The painters to take part in this exhibition are Degas , Monet , Pissarro , Renoir , Cezanne , Sisley , Berthe Morisot . I name these , not to the exclusion of others . Camille looked over at Caillebotte . " Are you harboring an illness ? " " Not at all . " " As a naval architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Caillebotte laughed low in his throat . " Just remember that this paper is with my notary . "  |p419Camille  walked him to the railroad station , carrying the two canvases . When he returned to the house he took the bank note out of his pocket , handed it to Julie as he kissed her . " Caillebotte has saved us from shipwreck . What a noble creature he is ! " " I 'll pray for him , " responded Julie . Everything turned around . Lucien was cured . The baby threw off whatever had been bothering him . As Julie went about her work in the house and garden she sang old Grancey ballads : " Little nightingale in the woods , Little untame nightingale , Teach me your language , Teach me to speak it , Teach me how love is made , How love is made . " The good rhythms of their family life returned : playing with the boys , teaching them to draw ; the picnics in the woods ; a unison achieved again . He set out at dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umbrella shading him and his canvas while he painted the banks of the Oise , the roads to nearby villages , portraits of Julie sewing by a window , picking vegetables in her garden , tending her rabbits ; a child with a drum , roses in a vase , poultry yards , seeking everywhere the poetry and lyricism of country life , creating a portrait of the Hermitage , Pontoise and the river valley so that it would never be lost no matter the inevitable change . He renewed his subscription to Le Charivari for its iconoclastic cartoons . Daumier lethally satirized the lawyers , courts , legislature . Cham excoriated the latest news . Gavarni was a genius at portraying grisettes and sensuous boudoir scenes . Beaumont prodded the follies of young love . Everything was grist for Le Charivari 's cartoonists : the weather , bachelor peccadilloes , cuckoldry , badgered parents , tailor 's bills , the Parisian in the country , the peasant in Paris , crinoline dresses on fussy ladies , holes in the roads . The cartoonists were not only delightful wits but superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretentious balloons , kept his perspective on the outside world finely tuned . By the end of summer he was still unable to sell a painting . Collectorswere away , the small galleries had no interest in new work . Oncep420again he ran out of money , wondered if he had the intestinal fortitude to withstand another threat of bankruptcy . Providence showed its face in the form of a restaurant and patisserie owner , Eugene Murer and his half sister Marie , a superb cook . Murer combed his hair long and thick at the back of his neck as the Parisian poets liked to do ; but he wore the trim beard and mustache of the painter , with a soft white collar , sans neckpiece ; and the corduroy coat of La Boherne . He appeared to have two sets of eyes : dark and brooding while he was thinking about poetry and art ; blazing , concupiscent when he was bargaining in business . He lacked only one quality to become a Baudelaire or Delacroix : he was devoid of any suspicion of talent . Nature had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the creative artist . Recognizing this , he and his sister had set up shop on the Boulevard Voltaire . Thanks to the handy location and to Marie 's cooking and pastries , the Murers were a success from the beginning . Camille met Eugene Murer through Renoir , who patronized the small restaurant . " I 've seen your paintings at the Independents ' shows , " Murer told Camille . " Would you like to do a fresco for my restaurant ? Renoir has already decorated the frieze . Monet has painted a wall of the bakery . A landscape of the kind you 've done at Montmorency or Pontoise ? I can pay you twenty dollars . " Murer was delighted with the view of the Seine at Osny with which Camille brought his restaurant to life . " Now why not do another mural ? " he asked . " I ca n't offer any more money but I can give you credit for meals , fresh bread and cakes to take home when you come to Paris . " With a half dozen of Camille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the most beautifully decorated restaurant in Paris . In addition he had begun buying oil paintings for his large apartment close by , evenhandedly , favoring no one , buying in successionfrom the Impressionists whose work he adored . But at bargain prices , paying no artist more than ten to twenty dollars even for the largest of the unframed canvases . They were all hard pressed ; those who had no need for money came to Murer 's for meals , late afternoon coffee , evening hot chocolate . When the walls of the restaurant were completed Murer gave a celebration dinner for which Marie prepared her famous sole cooked with banana strips and pine nuts . Renoir , winsome eves and plainp421whiskered face , arrived late , disheveled . He exclaimed to Murer , disregardingCamille 's presence with Julie : " I came to the house of a collector today , a painting under my arm , only to be told , ' Pissarro has just left , and I have taken a painting of his . It 's a human consideration : he has such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a bachelor and have no children , am I to starve to death ? I 'm in just as tight a corner as Pissarro , yet when they talk of me , no one says , ' That poor Renoir ! ' " Julie replied with a touch of acerbity : " Monsieur Renoir , get yourself married . Get yourself some children . Then people will feel sorry for you and buy your pictures . " Murer 's restaurant replaced the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes . Camilleon his occasional day in Paris spent a couple of hours there , enjoying the comradeship , the political discussions , the news about possible collectors , galleries . Always he pushed for another Impressionistshow . Marie Murer kept careful books on how much each artist ate or took home by way of bread and cake ; but Eugene was compassionate . He never refused to feed an artist or his family if he admired his work . . . and could acquire a picture . " But why does he take so long to pay ? " Julie asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of him than it is to get our Georges out of a In of temper . " " Merde . I had to pursue him ten times for every small payment for The Bottom Lands of St. Antoine . But he is the only one buying . " Knowing how badly Camille needed the money , and perhaps a bit ashamed at the low prices he paid , Murer came up with an inspired idea . " Why do n't we stage a lottery for one of your paintings ? I 'll print a hundred tickets for twenty cents each . We should have no trouble selling them . That means you 'll earn twenty dollars , or as much as eighty dollars if you 're willing to raffle four . You ca n't lose . Do you agree ? " Camille agreed . A sale in any tortured form was good news . " I 'll bring you four canvases . We 'll put them in cheap frames to make them more presentable and cover the cost by increasing the number of tickets by fifty . " Julie sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband sold some to his fellow mechanics . The artists sold a number to friends and the suppliers of paint and canvas . However most of the tickets were sold by Murer and Marie to the servant girls around the Boulevardp422Voltaire . Together they managed to dispose of one hundred tickets . The young girl who had the lucky number , picked out of a flour bin , rushed in to see her prize , set up on an easel in the front bakery amidst a luscious display of pastries . She gazed at Camille 's Peasant with a Donkey with a frown that developed into a grimace , twisted her bonnet in her hands , shuffled her feet until her toes were facing each other , then cried out : " If it 's all the same to you , I 'd rather have a cream bun . " She went out happily munching the bun . There was an embarrassed silence . Murer said resignedly : " Ah well , de gustibus non est disputandum . Anyway , Pissarro , here is your twenty dollars from the hundred tickets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " Oh no , " replied Murer , removing the thinly framed canvas from its easel . " It belongs to me . I paid a month 's work for it , as well as Marie 's cream bun . Do n't be disconsolate , my friend . Twenty dollars is better than a kick from the mule . " Julie took the money , muttered , " Let 's go home . What 's one paintingless to a man who makes hundreds ? Un hornme qui noie s ' attache un brin d'herbe . A drowning man clings to a blade of grass . " 7 . In the fall Leonie Monet became feverish and lethargic . Monet was trying to keep up the apartment , cook , take care of their son and paint . Julie suggested that Leonie and Jean be brought to the Hermitage where she could nurse Leonie better than Monet ; and Dr. Gachet could stop between trains on his way home to Auvers . Fright careened across Leonie 's eyes . " I do n't want to be separated from Claude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " When they left the Monet apartment , Julie asked : " Why ? " " He is her whole life , " Camille replied . " It 's called love , but love is not always in one 's best interest . " She shot him a glance with her eyelids raised high which said clearly , " You ought to know ! "  |p423Weeks  later when the two women were together Leonie confessed to Julie : " It takes more strength and courage than I have , but what can I do ? The doctor has forbidden us to make love . But we do . If I do n't take care of the family , and pose for him , I may lose him . " Julie thought with peasant realism , " It 's better than losing yourself . " In August Leonie became pregnant again . Both Dr. Gachet and Dr. de Bellio were aghast . It was far too dangerous for her to bear another child ; the earlier malfeasance made an abortion impossible . Temptation entered the life of Claude Monet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gagne Petit department store . Hoschede was still the single most ardent collector of the Impressionistsin Paris , despite the fact that he had twice found himself in financial difficulties and had had to auction off his collections . He still owned some of the best of Camille 's work as well as Monet 's , Manet 's , Renoir 's , Degas 's , Sisley 's and Morisot 's . Alice Hoschede was a deep-bosomed woman , middle-aged , generous , volatile , affectionate , mother of six and disillusioned with her overweight husband . She was determined to prove that she was young , feminine , attractive ; and fell wildly in love with Claude Monet , making no attempt to conceal her passion . Monet saw her frequently in the presence of his son and Leonie ; and discreetly alone . The Hoschedes had a distinguished apartment in Paris . He sometimes visited their country home for weeks of painting in the country . Alice Hoschede spent warm afternoons with Leonie , young Jean , and her own youngest , taking them to dinner , easing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic help , friendship . " I do n't like it , " said Cezanne , who appraised the situation immediately . He was visiting from Aix with Hortense and Paul , Jr. , the family spending the days in Pontoise with the Pissarros , the two men painting together . " Hoschede will hold all of us responsible , stop buying and perhaps even auction off our paintings to avenge himself . " They survived the fall and winter of X877 only through Camille 's importuning of Murer to buy more pictures and to pay the few dollars owed to him from earlier purchases . By now Murer had a first-rate collection from all the members of the Batignolles . " He 's building his own Louvre , " Degas growled . " He never pays us enough , " Camille added , " but what would we do without him ? " On the last day of 1877 Camille learned that Gustave Courbet hadp424died in exile in Bon-Port , Switzerland , at fifty-eight . He had suffered for six years under the crushing debt imposed upon him by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recriminations , loneliness , heavy drinking , bloated illness , an aching for Paris . Camille felt the loss keenly . He was indebted to Courbet for introducinghim to the art world of Paris , for his encompassing hospitality at the Brasserie Andler , for teaching him by example and approval of his work right up to the day of his flight from the country . Those painters who owed a debt to Courbet gathered for an informal memorial . " It was a cruel fate , " declared Monet soberly . " Is n't that the inherentnature of fate ? Ah , but Courbet 's magnificent body of work ! That will be remembered when the Vendome Column story is but an obscenejoke . " Shortly after the first of the year Camille began working on the next Impressionist show . Caillebotte again offered to pay the month 's rent on whatever favorable rooms they could find , but suggested that they wait until June this time . Perhaps if they exhibited after the Salon closed people would appreciate the difference . Claude Monet responded , " We ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . There 'll be a million people from all over , not only the Paris cynics . " Renoir abandoned them completely , running his index finger under his nose in a habitual gesture . " There are in Paris scarcely fifteen art lovers capable of liking a painting without Salon approval . There are eighty thousand who wo n't buy an inch of canvas if the painter is not in the Salon . I do n't want to waste my time in resentment . I believe one must do the best painting possible . That 's all . My submitting to the Salon is entirely a business matter . " Acerbic Degas commented later , " The only reason he ever showed with us is that the Salon jury has been turning him down . He 's been given to understand that he has a good chance of acceptance this year . " " I 'd be sorry to lose him , " Camille said mournfully . " He is one of our best . " Charles Francois Daubigny died in February at the age of sixty-one . Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fusty Salon juries , he received no official funeral . The BeauxArtsignored the occasion . As the artists gathered in the cemetery they extolled his vision , courage , loyalty in the face of inevitable retribution ,  |p425declared  that his painting would forever delight and replenish the peoples of the world . Corot , Courbet , Daubigny . The artists clung together with a heavy sense of their mortality , the depletion of their ranks . Theodore Duret invited Camille to visit Cognac , his parental home . He would have freedom to paint the countryside around Cognac . He also paid him twenty dollars for the purchase of " the small woman washing her linen . " Camille did not know whether the invitation included Julie and the boys , but he knew it was useless to ask since he was in fact living in a moneyless world and would not be able to round up the train fare . He was again walking the streets of Paris ; " a medieval peddler . " Petit , a dealer , bought a small panel for ten dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garcon informed him that Petit was away on his honeymoon . He crossed the city to the Boulevard Voltaire and Murer 's restaurant and bakery shop . " I 'm waiting for this drop of water like a traveler in the desert , " he said to Murer plaintively . " Could n't you advance me this sum ? " Murer loaned him the ten dollars . To Guillaumin , who invited him to have a beer on the terrace of the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes , Camille said : " Art is a matter of a hungry belly , an empty purse , of luckless devils . Yet it is n't me I 'm feeling sorry for but my family . I 've bogged them . What torment , you have no idea . " Guillaumin chose this unpropitious moment to speak his mind . " Pissarro , I no longer have hope of winning a fortune in the lottery . I 've wasted fifteen years in that Department of Bridges and Causeways . I do n't want to be nothing more than a Sunday painter . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Camille studied the plain face of his thirty-seven-year-old friend and disciple , then watched the crowd in the Place Pigalle pass by , workingmenin coveralls , housewives out to market , holding tightly to their string bags . Guillaumin had learned a good deal while painting alongsideCamille ; he had an emerging talent . But his chances of success when the best of the Independents were living sou to soup ? What could he say ? " Guillaumin , I agree . An artist who has worked fifteen years , having another position in hand , has wasted seven years . It is a hundred times better to send the city to the devil . But it takes a bit of character . Ip426headed for Caracas to break the cable attaching me to bourgeois life . What I have suffered is unheard of ; but I have lived . " Guillaumin gazed glumly into the last of his beer . " I guess I 'll buy more lottery tickets . " The next morning Camille sent Murer a petit bleu through Paris 's underground pneumatique , which would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bicycle . " Last night I spoke to you of a painting I have in Pontoise . You know this painting , it 's a small peasant woman with a brick-red figure , head covered by a yellowish hood . If you like this canvas I will gladly sell it to you , having a desperate need to send money to Pontoise . . . . I 'm throwing everything overboard , as these studies were dear to me . " I will let you have it if you will pay me for the two small canvases ten dollars each . The Breton will have to be twenty dollars . " Murer bought the paintings but paid for them only a couple of dollars at a time . " Enough , " Julie was heard to mutter , " to keep me from killing myself . " Murer then decided he wanted Camille to paint his portrait . He had already hinted at this . His bakery shop was flourishing ; he was a collector . " How much would you charge me for the portrait ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Murer was aghast . " Thirty . . . But I only paid Renoir twenty dollars for his portrait of Marie . " Camille decided to hold his ground . " It will take at least a dozen sittings . I want you to know that before quoting you a price I consulted my friend Renoir and we agreed on this price , which seems reasonable to me . Less seems impossible . " Murer desperately wanted the portrait . He yielded . " But I 'll have to pay it out so much a sitting . " Encouraged by phantoms , he took Murer 's advance home to Julie , apologizing for his recent depression . Julie brushed past his apology , took the money with a wan smile . " Now I can dare go into the shops again . They were beginning to hate my face . " He held her tight ; kissed her heartily . " It 's a lovely face . I thought so at the beginning . I think so now . "  |p429He  met the tall startling-looking man in the expensive black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Arosa 's superb collection of Delacroix , Courbet and seemingly unfinished Daumier oil paintings had thoroughly moved him . Arosa introduced him as his godson , Paul Gauguin , whose mother had been a friend of the Arosa family . When she was dying she had extracted a promise from the Arosas that they would care for the young boy . Camille was intriguedby him ; the powerful build with a bull neck , the flagrant self-assurance with which he wore his expensive clothes , the attractiveness in a brutalfashion ; a broken bony nose slashed across his face , a large narrow head , narrow forehead , hooded blue-green eyes , dark hair , dramaticallyhigh cheekbones , tan mustache . A long firm chin suggested a touch of braggadocio ; yet under it all perhaps a character of strongresolution . " If you ask me who I am , " Paul Gauguin said in a throaty voice , " I'lltell you I come from the Borgias of Aragon and the Viceroy of Peru . You 'll say that 1'ni a boaster . If I tell you the Gauguins are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Try a few prosaic facts . " The man grinned . " I do n't know any . I spent six years on South American ships as a stoker and seaman . Those six years made a man of me . Arosa says you come from St. Thomas . Of course we stopped at St. Thomas . Beautiful brown girls at Charlotte Amalie , we dreamed about them for weeks before reaching your port . I 'll tell you about my conquestsof women , but I 'm a terrible liar ! " Camille threw his head back and laughed . True , he did walk with the rolling gait of a sailor . When Gauguin had completed his service on the Jerome Napoleon during the Franco-Prussian War he was twenty-three and needed a job . Gustave Arosa secured him a position through his son-in-law , who was a director of the Bertin stockbrokerage . They put him to work in the Rue Laffitte office . His bold , colorful assurance was perfect for a salesman . If his approach was a bit coarse it also contained a contagious conviviality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recounted to Camille that five years before he had married a young Danish girl , Mette Gad , whom he had met at a proper boardinghousewhere Mette was having her first holiday in Paris . She was Gauguin 's age , a tall attractive blond with a vivacious manner , chinablueeyes , the daughter of Danish civil servants . Gauguin had showed her the more respectable parts of Paris . They fell in love . He was now a successful stockbroker who could raise her out of the middle class of civil servants . Mette was broad-beamed and looked as though she would be an efficient housewife and mother . What more could an attractive young couple ask ? They now had two children , Emile and Aline . " I went to your Impressionist show and laughed with the rest of the clowns , " Gauguin told him in his onrushing voice . " After a couple of sleepless nights I realized I had made a fool of myself . I want to make amends by acquiring paintings . Why do n't I start with you ? I have money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll tell my wife the paintings are a safe investment ; which they are . " Paul Gauguin came out to Pontoise the following Sunday , selected a small Snow at Louveciennes , the fields under a heavy covering of white , and a larger Harvest , Pontoise showing pickers among the fruit trees , twenty-six by thirty-two inches . " You chose well , Gauguin . " Gauguin 's sun-drenched skin flushed purple at the compliment . Hep431confessed that he had been drawing in his spare time and studying seriously the Arosa collection . " I have a fellow broker at Bertin 's , Schuffenecker , we call him Schuff , " Gauguin continued ; " he is an amateur painter and enthusiast . He has guided me through the Louvre , the Luxembourg . He took me to Nadar 's for the first show of the Independents . He taught me how to evaluate oil paintings and insisted I spend an evening or two a week at the Academic . Collarossi . I 've been sketching steadily at home . " Camille was attracted to this colorful fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wife . Told her I was out with my mistress . She would prefer that to my taking drawing lessons . She 's afraid my hobby will corrupt my drive to earn a good living . " Camille chuckled inwardly , " And so it will , so it will . " " I also had to hide that I had a small painting accepted by the 1876 Salon . It was sufficiently ignored to keep me safe . " Gauguin spent a few Sundays at Pontoise painting with Camille . Beneath the gauche beginnings Camille sensed an incipient talent . " You 're the only professional who has been willing to take the time to teach me , " Gauguin said as they worked along the bank of the Oise with several green islands floating against the downsweep of the tide . " Teaching is also learning , " Camille replied to the successful **25;13620;TOOLONG and repressed artist who was as grateful as a schoolboy for any hint about improving his work . Camille made suggestionsfor strengthening Gauguin 's drawing , explained the use of nature 's colors without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows to light tones . Gauguin insisted on taking Julie and the boys to a Pontoise inn for their midday meal , a hearty one in this area ofd France . He also offered to sell some of Camille 's paintings . " An employee of the stock exchange wants to buy two paintings and naturally I will make him take Pissarros . Do n't be annoyed at what I say , but I would like to have for this young man two paintings with the most stylish and charming subjects possible . He 's a fellow who knows nothing at all but has no pretension of knowing anything , which is already good . " Hie sale was made . Both Camille and Julie were delighted and grateful for the francs . Julie noted Camille 's growing fondness for the ebullient , sometimes boisterous younger man ; she herself was more reserved . F his man had no core of gentleness such as had attracted herp432to Camille ; in fact she had a small reserve of fear of him . To her peasant mentality there was something incipiently savage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Gauguin to the Cafe de la Nouvelle Athenes to meet the group . Degas took to him at once because of his rough-edged tongue . Edouard Manet glanced through his portfolio . . . drawings of the nude models at the Academie Collarossi , two studies of the Arosa house at St. Cloud , a somber winter scene , Seine in Paris , said , " Some of these are good . " " I 'm only an amateur , ' ' Gauguin murmured . " No , " Manet replied , " the amateurs are those who make bad paint-ings . " Claude Monet and Renoir actively disliked him because he was a businessman , and hence to them a dilettante . They were grateful for his purchases of their work but unwilling to give friendship , suspecting that he was trying to buy their allegiance . That did not put Paul Gauguinoff ; he kept acquiring from Camille , Monet , Manet , Sisley , Cezanne , Jongkind , Renoir , Guillaumin , until he had spent some three thousand dollars and had the beginnings of a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted into the group . Leonie and Claude Monet 's second son , Michel Jacques , was born on March 17 , 1878 , the child whom the doctors had warned her against conceiving . Julie spent several days in their apartment taking care of the older Monet boy and the household . When she was obliged to return to her own family , Alice Hoschede stepped in to care for them . The few telegrams Camille had received over the years had containedbad news . He tore open the telegram of April 17 with trembling fingers , read to Julie : PIETTE DIED YESTERDAY . SUDDENLY . HEARTBROKEN . ADELEA sense of shock swept through them . Then came grief in unmeasurablequantities . Piette had been Camille 's most ardent admirer ; he and Adele had accepted Julie wholeheartedly . Over the years Camille , Julie , the children had spent enriching months in Montfoucault , whose doors were always open to them . They had lost not only their closest friend but a refuge and second home . What had happened ? True , Piette had been depressed over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell his paintings ; or to be able top433paint in Paris . Nevertheless he had been full of life , with dozens of contradictory political ideas . He was too robust to pine away . Camille studied the telegram for a third time . The message had been delayed for more than a full day , perhaps because of the routing from Montfoucaultto Mayenne through Paris to Pontoise . " I 'll have to catch the morning train to Mayenne , " he said . Julie attempted to slake her tears with her fingertips . " Bring Adele back with you . To become part of our family . She loves the boys . " Camille went into the village post office , sent a telegram to Adele that he would be arriving late the next afternoon and to please hold off the funeral because he wished to be present . For the first time there was no Piette to meet him . At the Mayenne railroad station he hired a one-horse rig which he drove none too skillfully to Montfoucault . Piette 's aunt from Le Mans , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eves , was working with an advocate from Mavenne . She greeted him with saddened courtesy . " I 'm sorry , Monsieur Pissarro , but we buried Piette yesterday . We had no idea you were coming . " " My telegram . . . ? " The woman shook her head . " Probably waiting in the Mayenne office for tomorrow 's postal rider . " " Where is Adele ? May I speak with her ? " The aunt shook her head in perplexity . " Adele is gone . Left immediately after the burial . " " To Paris ? " " I do n't know . She took her clothing , some of her personal things and departed . Did n't leave an address . " Camille stared at the woman , feeling as though he must be openmouthed . " But surely you know whether she has a mother or father alive ? I must find her , take her home to Pontoise . " The aunt sighed in resignation , then introduced him to the man working over Piette 's papers . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have dreamed . He would never sell off any of his land but he borrowed heavily against it . Now it must he sold so the banks can get their money hack . " Camille groaned inwardly . " There will be enough for Adele to live on ? " he asked  |p434The  advocate looked up from his papers , said grimly : " We wo n't get enough through a sale to pay off the bank debts . The furniture will have to be auctioned , their paintings as well . It 's a dismal view . " Camille hung his head in despair . Piette , the young man at the Suisse who had concealed his wealth so that he would not be catered to by false friends . . . to end up bankrupt . Adele with no means of support . The aunt said consolingly : " Adele did take two of her favorite Piette paintings with her . I have permission to take another pair home to Le Mans . " On the train back to Paris Camille rehearsed the obituary he would have delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good farmer or businessman . Within limits he was a capable painter but he had taken himself out of the ambience where he perhaps could have grown . If he had had sons to carry on the farm ; if his apartment house in Paris had not been bombed in the Franco-Prussian War . . . He had been so full of love for Camille . Now he was gone . There was nothing to be done for him , except save Adele and give her a home . He could not find her . She had disappeared . He searched everywhere : in the Jewish quarter where Piette had first seen her and admiredher semi-oriental beauty ; at the local synagogue . He asked at the shops , inquiring about not only Adele but her family , knocked on the front doors of dozens of apartments , checked the banks where the family might have had accounts . No one remembered anything about the Levys ; they had been gone too long . He found no trace . She had crept into some secret corner to live out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day ? " Julie asked , when he at last abandoned the search . An important part of their world and their past was gone . He spent considerable time in Paris trying to find collectors , but most of his days were spent in the countryside seeking motifs . He was painting farther afield and no longer returned for midday dinner . Julie , pregnant once again , gave him a substantial breakfast at dawn andp435packed a lunch for him , hard cheese between slabs of bread , some fruit in season . He carried with him a jug of cool well water which he propped upright against a shade tree . He had been a casual pipe smoker , now each time a dead-end situation flooded over his mind he filled the bowl of the discolored clay pipe and let the tobacco smoke befog his painful predicament . But not his work . In the cold or rain he remained at his easel just short of pneumonia , returning home to warm himself before an open fire . In warm weather he sometimes fell asleep in the shade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ During the clement weather he was out as the sun rose , returning home at dusk when the light was failing , to have supper and spend a couple of hours teaching Lucien to draw , helping Georges with his homework and playing with four-year-old Felix . Neither the Hermitage nor Pontoise any longer thought him an oddity . He had been there too long and worked too steadily . Nor did anyone but the shopkeepers and landlord know about his falls from monetary grace . The rest of the community knew that he sometimes sold his paintings ; had he not once received some two hundred dollars for a landscape , as much as all except the landowners earned in a year ? If the villagers had known about their debt-ridden existence they would not have held it against them . Who was not in debt ? Each day he went across the Pontoise countryside to Valhermeil by way of Le Chou ; followed the Oise as far as Auvers , planted his easel in congenial spots ; observed the land and its people ; and painted . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whistler Holding , which he carpentered himself , his fresh colors burst into light like fireworks . No matter how long the workday , there was no opportunity to daydream , reminisce . Painting demanded total concentration on the task at hand . He did not carry a watch ; time for him was a fluid . Except for his midday break he did not know what hour it was , nor did he care . He used his paints and brushes meticulously , spilling little , talking to no one , not even the peasants who passed , unaware of anything but the scene to he possessed in what he believed to be as immortal a medicine as man had yet devised . The town or country people who passed detected no movement , he was so inextricably one with his canvas , another tree growing in the field or along a path . He was feeling deeply , not in terms of words or intellectual concepts , only in the emotions evoked by the landscape before him and his reaction to its clarity and meaning. **25;13647;TOOLONG ritual .

"  |p101Chauntecleer  began a vicious sentence , " You  --  " He bit it off . He lowered himself and gazed at her as though discoveringsomething . " Are you still awake ? " he said .

" The Hen bent her head in the darkness , then , and whispered , " You might touch me tonight . You might not pull away from me tomorrow morning . Some good . " For a long moment Chauntecleer sat utterly still upon this lowest branch of the Hemlock . Hens slept all above them , and above the Hens , wild , scudding clouds and a bright moon and the ceaseless wind . The night was frigid , the moon an absolute zero . The waterfall thundered less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice ; and the shores of the Liverbrook , winter-bitten , were snaggled with a thinner ice ; and Lord Chauntecleer was cold , simply cold . Cold was the thing that made him shiver.  | " I 've got to go , " he said . Pertelote cried , " Why ? " But he leaped and left her behind . He glided twenty yards and landed and stood still in greylight , and looked , and saw his dim moonshadow lying down beside him . " Because I am so cold , " he whispered . Why else ? But the shadow , which could be seen only from the side of the eye , seemed unsatisfied with that . Why ? " Well , " said Chauntecleer . He shrugged . He glanced around the frozen night , and the wind blew . " Well , to see the Animals , " he said . And he said , " This is a very good reason : to see my Animals . " Afterthoughts may turn into very good motives and opportunities in their own right . Lord Chauntecleer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by Rooster struts . Ah , how long had it been since he 'd smelled the smell of the Mouse 's hole ? Such a warm , consoling odor , like breaddough , close and yeasty , altogether homely . The dear Mice ! Why , Chauntecleer wondered as he breathed their sleepsmellsin ; why had he denied himself this kindness ? His shoulderswere pressed against their entrance , his head and beak sunk to the hollow of their quarters . He felt a sob thump in his chest . His breath , when he drew it deeply , sounded like a sigh . Immediately , a tiny voice spoke . " I 'm sorry , Rooster , " it said . " Freitag ? " Ghauntecleer was startled by life . " Is that you ? " " Well , but I wish it was n't . But it is , dear Rooster , " said the Mouse Freitag . " It 's me . " " You 're still awake ? " " Well , but I do n't have the right to sleep . " " Freitag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Mouse 's hole . Then a tiny rustling . Then a different voice spoke . " He is very tired , Rooster ; you are right . But I think that maybe what you 're hearing mostly is that Freitag is very sad . "  | " Wodenstag ? " said Chauntecleer . " Are you awake , too ? " " Oh , well , yes , " said Wodenstag . " Rooster ? " A third voice , the youngest of them all . " Samstag ! What is it ? " " You see , we are all awake . " " Why ? It 's the middle of the night . " " Well , we have n't slept for a long time , now . " " Shhh , Samstag , " whispered several of the Brothers . " You should n't mention such things to the Rooster . He does n't need to worry over us . " But Chauntecleer was right there , listening . He was n't far away . " In God 's name , tell me , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you sleep ? " Samstag whispered , still as though he were not there , " I think that I will tell him , Wodenstag , on account of , he asked . " And to Chauntecleer : " We stay awake with Freitag , to keep him company . " Chauntecleer said , " Freitag  --  " But the mere speaking of the Mouse 's name unmanned that Mouse . He began to cry : " Hoo-hoo . Hoo-hoo , " such a pitiful snuffling and so polite that Chauntecleer felt gross and clumsy . He truly did n't understandFreitag 's trouble , though all the Brothers seemed to . How long had this been going on ? How much had he missed ? And why should tiny Mice protect their Lord  --  ? The Rooster , by willing it , restrained his own confusion ; he gathered all his care and all his sensitivity into a gentle voice and spoke for the Mice alone . " Do you remember ? " he asked slowly , " how I took you from the river long ago , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Wodenstag and Donnerstag and Sonntag . " Yes . Yes , " all of them full of solemnity . " Do you remember , Freitag ? " Freitag said , " Hoo-hoo , yes , hoo-hoo . " " You were so brave , to climb from the river onto my back . Remember ? And you trusted me , and that 's why I could save you then . Remember , Freitag ? "  | " Hoo-hoo . " " Do you trust me now , enough to lay your trouble on me ? So that I could help you now ? I still help , little Tag . I do n't hurt Mice . Do you believe that ? " " Oh truly , truly  --  hoo-hoo . " " Then tell me , why do n't you sleep ? Why do you cry ?

" Chauntecleer 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent division of good and evil  --  and he could n't speak . Freitag could . Freitag said , " A wicked Creature does n't have the right to sleep . " " You are not a wicked Creature ! " Chauntecleer struggled to keep his voice from sounding angry . " Oh , yes , I am very wicked , " sighed the Mouse . " Because  --  " And then the words tumbled from him : " I made fun of you , Rooster . I mocked you , yes , yes . I walked like you walk , and I crowed like you crowed , and all my Brothers laughed at it , and you would never hurt me , but I hurt you , dear Rooster , because you did n't smile at what I did , but you were kind , you did n't scold me either .

You just walked away from me . The windshrieked a manic winter in the woods . The moon accused him . The Rooster felt naked . Walking away : that was his sin , not Freitag 's ! Yet that little Mouse accepted the fault without a second thought , because that little Mouse  --  and here was the worst pain  --  that little Freitag loved him . He put his head into their hole again . With fierce restraint , he counted his words like coins . " You think you sinned against me ? " he asked . " It is the way that I am , " said Freitag . A bleak answer , a bleak Mouse.  | " If you sinned against me , " said Chauntecleer , " then it 's my right to punish you , is n't it ? " " Yes . " " But not your right at all . You have to accept my will . " " Yes . " " Freitag ? " " What ? " " My will is not to punish you . So you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freitag ? " " What ? " " My will is to forgive you . I forgive you . There is no sin any more . It 's gone . Do you hear me ? Forgiveness makes a sin gone , and you are good again . Good Creatures have every right to sleep . Go to sleep , Freitag . Go to sleep , now . Can you go to sleep ? " Freitag took a long time to answer . Oh , God , why could n't all the world smell as kind and woolen and comforting as a Mouse 's hole on a winter 's night ? Finally the honest Mouse answered , " I do n't know . " Chauntecleer said , " How if I told you one thing else ? " " What ? " said Freitag . " That I love you with all my heart , little Tag . " " Yes , " sighed Freitag , infinitely relieved . " Yes , that makes a difference . " Wodenstag asked , " Then we can all go back to sleep ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chauntecleer . " No ? " said Wodenstag . " Then , good night . Good all of your nights . Sleep , Tags . Sleep please . " " Good night , Rooster . Rooster ? " " What ? " " And we love you . " Ack ! Chauntecleer pulled himself into the winter wind again , sucking huge breaths of air . Ack ! Ack ! That was exactly what he could not hear , this loving him . Freitag could hear it . All the Mice could hear it , because they were truly , truly innocent ,  |p106and  their hearts were so good , so worthy of the love . But Chauntecleer the Rooster was a curse . The more that he was loved , the more he deceived , and the farther he was from the truth and from all who would love him ! This loving , ack ! This loving was a scourging . Almost he buried himself in the shrieking wind . Almost he flung himself deeper into the night . But suddenly the wind died for an instant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly inaudible crunching to his left , behind a thicket at the base of the stone cliff . Somebody else was wakeful  --  O poor Chauntecleer ! Somebody else had secrets he knew nothing about  --  O incompetent Lord of the Animals ! The crunching softened to a chewing , and the chewing ended with the smack of a narrow beak . As a criminal drawn to his own crime , almost seeking the pain he deserved , Chauntecleerstole toward the thicket . The wind resumed its whistlinginsanity , covering his approach ; and he peeped to the wall ; and he saw the white shadow of a Hen , alone , bending away from him and pecking something . " Chalcedony ! " he wailed . Instantly the skinny Hen whipped around , recognized him , fluttered for a moment , then covered her something with her butt . She plopped down , embarrassed . Chauntecleer cried , " Does nobody sleep any more ? What are you doing ? " He sounded so angry that he shocked the truth from her . " Snacks , sir , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Chauntecleer 's cry meant to encompass the universe . But Chalcedony took all things personally and in particular . Miserablyshe stood up and stepped aside , admitting to the nest of insect limbs beneath her . Her secret ? Crushed skeletons and dead skins . " Snacks , " she said . Chauntecleer stared at the junk , astonished . He looked closely into Chalcedony 's face and saw , to his enormous grief ,  |p107a  Cicada leg hanging at the corner . She fed on garbage ! " Well . Well  --  " the Hen hastened to explain . " Well , Jasperdoes n't never leave me eat , no blame on her . So I keep me some little snacks where she ca n't see nor gobble them afore I do , you see . And come the night , I 'll steal from my roost  --  but I 'm sorry now that I do  --  and maybe snack a bit , then steal back , thinking to myself that , Who 's the wiser ? Who 's the worser for my little habits ? Thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better these nights . But maybe I should of shared , sir ? That 's what you 're thinking , by your silence , sir , that how come Chalcedony 's so selfish ? And why did n't she share ? Sir  --  ? " The Rooster only gazed at her , long and intensely. "  --  and you 're right , " she whispered , blushing , answering for him . " Why may n't Chalcedony share a treasure , if and that she has one  --  " She ran out of words . His unwavering gaze shamed and baffled her , the Lord of the land , raking her with silent judgment . So what could the poor Hen do ? She began to curtsy , and then she could n't quit . Up and down , up and down , grinningsilly , she curtsied , and her lame claw ached . It was a hoarse whisper , when finally the Rooster spoke . " What have I missed ? " he said . " That I eat , sir , " she chattered excuses for him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No you , Chalcedony , " he whispered . " How could I have missed seeing you ? " " Oh , you never , sir , " she said .

" " At me ? " Oh , ' t was a terrible thing , to be the object of this conversation . " And this garbage ! " he said , more scornfully . Suddenly he reached his beak to the corner of hers , and she flinched , be/cause either he was going to strike her or to kiss her . He did neither . He picked the insect 's leg , then spat it to the wind , and then she was flustered , truly . " Snacks , " she mumbled , " sir . " How ugly she must look . " Look at you ! " he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never saw it before . Oh , Chalcedony , can you forgive me ? " That was a frightening switch . No , Chalcedony did n't know about forgiving . She knew about weeping . Now she just wanted to weep and to disappear . " Are you angry ? " she whispered . " You should n't be so skinny , " cried the Rooster . " I 'm working on a cure , " she whispered . " You ? " he barked . " You ? " roared Chauntecleer . His voice battered her , and the sobs rose up of their own accord , so then she was crying after all . " No , not you , " thundered Chauntecleer . " Me ! I 'm the one responsible ! I should feed you . I should make you fat . Dear God in Heaven , one of my Hens is eating garbage . " Chalcedony could n't think up excuses any more .

" Troubles , you bet , and might-be the Rooster , he does n't wait till daybreakings to do somethings about it . " The one-eared Weasel was grinning . He positively delighted in bearing bad news , because crises put him at the center of excitement , and centers were fine places in which to strut .

He winked at Chalcedony , verifying terror . Chauntecleer stiffened . " Ooo , Foxfaceghouling on the plain , " hooted John Wesley . Chauntecleer was suffering . " I do not , " he whispered , " understand you , John . What is the trouble ? " " Why , is Fox-face . Is Russel-bones come back again , " said John . " Grave could n't keep a Fox down when the ice pops  --  and whoops ! Threw him bones back up again  --  " All at once it seemed as though Lord Chauntecleer doubled in size . His feathers stood from his body , and a vicious hissing erupted his beak . He threw out his wings and leapt into the air . He beat them savagely , rising to the shrieking wind , and then himself tore south in the streaming and gone . " Chicky , " said the Weasel to Chalcedony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooster needs a good somebody by him side . Bycausewho 's not ascared to look at death ? Why , John ! " One Creature was cheerful in that winter 's night : just look at the effect he had on Chauntecleer . Grand ! One ran south excited . The other lay alone , waiting until she was truly alone . Then she arose and pushed her insect parts together in a tidy pile . Chalcedony was ever neat . She scratched a little hole in the earth and swept the whole pile into it . " No more snacks for my Lady , no , " she whispered . " She 's got her whimsies , does n't she ? Why may n't my Lady say no when she wants to  --  and still remain a Lady ? " But she hung her head at the roost and said , " No Lady never ate garbage , no . Chalcedony 's no Lady . "  |p110John  Wesley was a totally different Weasel when he rushed back to the Hemlock just short of an hour later . He 'd lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had seen , and it took him a while to focus on Pertelote , yet he 'd come to warn her , to get her , something . He kept yanking at his single ear . " Lady Hen ? " " John Wesley , is that you ? " " Lady Hen ? " " John ! Speak up  --  I ca n't hear you in the wind ! " " Miss Pertelote ? " Pertelote sank from her branch and found the Weasel somehowstalled at a distance from the tree . He stood watching her come , his head tipped sideways as though they were both troubled by the same question , though she did n't know the question . He looked with a certain hunger into her eyes , yet she had the odd sensation of sightlessness in his eyes . He was gazing inward at a memory . " John , " she said . " What 's the matter ? " " Lady Hen ? " " Yes . It 's me . " The wind howled around them , so she put her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus , and then concern spread all over his face . " Is a Rooster ! " he confided to her . " Rooster 's crazy , John thinks . Lady ! Rooster 's brains is buggared ! "  | " Chauntecleer ? " " Him . The Rooster . " " You 've seen him . " " But he did n't see John , no . John , he 's a ghost to the Rooster , oh . " Pertelote 's heart bulked inside of her . " Please , John : where is he ? What 's he doing ? " " To the Fox 's grave , Lady  --  " " Why ? " " By-cause John , he sent him  --  " " Why , John ? " " By-cause him Fox-bones come up on the ground , and John , he seen  --  " " John ! Why is Chauntecleer there ? What is he doing , that troubles you ? John ! Look at me ! What 's wrong with Chaunte-cleer ? " " Oh , well . Oh , well . Rooster  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebodies think ? John , he do n't know : Rooster 's fighting the Fox-bones now . " Pertelote put her claw on the Weasel 's shoulders , startling him . Straight into his eye she said , " You 'll stay with the Hens , then , wo n't you , John . " " Lady Hen , she goes to the Rooster ? " " Yes . " " Good ! " In an instant , each trusted the other 's capacity  --  " Good ! "  --  so that a little assurance entered this blithering night , and they parted , John Wesley Protector , the yearning Pertelote the Healer . A high wind is hard to fly in . Darkness makes it worse . Worst of all , the woman was distracted , her mind repeating a foolish refrain : " He did n't say dead , he did n't say dead , " and her stomach clutching at the fear of what her husband might be , if not dead  --  but " dead " was the greatest horror , and he did n't say dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grove of trees . Her wings hit twigs . Spiderwebslashed her eyes . A splintered limb gouged flesh from her earlobe , stunned her , and she tumbled into the ground . When she shook her head , the blood whipped forward to her face , and she tasted it . She did not fly again . She stood . She found her balance . And with her head thrust forward , her wingtips low to skim the ground , she ran . There were patches of fog on the battle-plains , so that she saw the sea and then saw nothing at all  --  the sea in starlight , then a damp , chill , personal gloom . West she ran , a little lost : how far to Russel 's grave ? WWWHUMP ! went the breakers from Wyrmesmere , rollingtoward her on the left , standing and bowing , collapsing a dreadful weight , then retreating with a hiss down the shingle . The streaking wind had raised up Wyrmesmere . The sea was awake : WWWHUMP ! Suddenly she heard ahead of her a sound like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea still pounding periods . The sound was urgent and distant , both ; it was high and hateful , was dragged out infinitely long , and must have crossed the sea to its horizon . It might have been the wind , resolved into a living voice : " Weir-weir-weir-weir  --  " Winter ice sank into Pertelote 's soul . She shuddered with the cold and with recognition , and she went forward . It was not the wind . It was Chauntecleer , calling with all his might . It was the solitary Rooster , calling across the sea , " Wyrm ! " Not dead . He did n't say dead . But then what was he , if not dead ? She ran forward . The fog dissolved in front of her and a figure appeared on the plain , dark , bent , struggling . Pertelote opened her mouth to call , but she did not . Forms took shape in the starlight . She saw , and a horror silenced her . The Rooster had clamped Russel 's carcass at the neck , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerks was yanking his brother seaward . The corpse did not complain . Black shadows sat in Russel 's eyes , and in his mouth was ap113bottomless shadow ; and Russel had a grin . His tail slid like a rope . His four legs turned under like straps . He was ghastly skinny . He was bones , Russel . Russel was bones . WWWHUMP ! Nor did Chauntecleer stop at the sea . He took the slamming waves upon his back . Pertelote gasped . But the Rooster went into the icy waters and drew the Fox 's body after him . These two rose in the foam . But the breakers overpowered them , swallowed and spat them like lumps of mucous . " Oh , Chauntecleer , " Pertelote breathed , afraid for him . " Chauntecleer ! " The bodies went under a sweeping water . Five beats of her heart , and miraculously they surfaced again , beyond the breakers . Pertelote 's heart rose up . Chauntecleer had a drivingwill . Behold : he butted Russel before a steady swimming , and Russel rolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sea . They were two details on a wide immensity , starflecked . Pertelote hardly knew what her husband was doing  --  but he was not crazy . There came , finally , a mighty thrust from Chauntecleer and a separation : the Fox went nosing toward the deep . A Rooster stayed behind . But a voice went up from the waters : " I will remember you , Lord Russel ! " Pertelote 's wing was at her mouth . All at once her heart broke for the lonely memorial in her husband 's voice , all by himself giving honor unto the dead . He did the thing alone . He did n't know that someone was watching " The water 's your grave , my brother ! " he cried seaward , but Pertelote heard . " Your journey , endless ; but that is the way it should be . " But then he wailed such a lamentation that tears burst at Pertelote 's eyes . " How many have I loved like you , Lord Russel the Fox  --  " Then he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ofhim . Rooster 's ca n't swim ! Roosters were n't made for swimming . He splashed in desultory fashion generally toward theshore , then the waves grabbed him like a rag and twisted thep114poor Cock over and under ; they lifted him , pitched him into the shallows and overran him with a traveling spume  --  and he did n't fight them . Pertelote ran to the beach . She waded as far as she could . Then his body rode forward on a surge , and before it sucked him back again , she seized his tailfeathers in her claw and rooted herself to the earth . Then it was Pertelote who dragged him again to dry ground . His head lolled to the left . " Oh , Chauntecleer , " she whispered . " Oh , please , Chaunte-cleer ! " He did n't say dead . He did n't say dead , 0 Lord ! The Rooster groaned , out of a mortal exhaustion . She felt a rush of gratitude so deep that it felt like laughter . He sighed , " I had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still , pasted thin with wet feathers . WWWHUMP ! Pertelote made towels of her wings and chafed the poor Cock 's body to make the blood run . " It 's me , " she whispered . " It 's me , Chauntecleer . I 'm with you now . " Whether it was the cold , or the weariness , or her presence , she did not know ; he began to shiver violently , and she cried for him . " Oh , Chauntecleer ! Oh , my suffering Chauntecleer , " she wept . And then she could do nothing but hold him , tight , tight to her breast , fighting the shivers for him . " Chauntecleer  --  " She rocked her husband . He had n't fought the sea ; he did n't fight her either . He was a chick beneath her wings . The wind : now , finally , the wind relaxed and coiled in the wood north of them , sighing merely ; and the sky lightened to a cold , cold grey ; and she closed her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till her back ached . And deep in her throat she sang a husky lullaby : "  --  the summer 's summer , long gone by , The evening when my Lord and I Were young :  |p115He  took my tears on faith , and IWould stroke his neck , and I would sigh This song  --  " " Pertelote , " said Chauntecleer , a baby 's voice beneath her . " What ? " she said . He paused , then he whispered , terribly tired , terribly wretched , " Go away . " Pertelote 's first reaction was panic . She stopped rocking and singing together . But her second reaction was so swift that it was done before she thought of it . She said absolutely , " No . " And she held him the tighter . " Please , " he whined . " Oh , Pertelote , you 're killing me . " The Hen put her head up with stiff dignity , though she kept her eyes closed and she released him not a whit . " No , I am loving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You are loving me , " he said . " It is your love that hurts so much , so much , so much , sweet Pertelote . " " I do n't , " she said . Oh , he was a mere bruise in her embrace . And he was such a mystery , surrounded by his private phantoms . She hated his phantoms . " I do not understand this , " she said . " Tonight the poor Tags loved me , and I could hardly stand it , " he whispered slowly , " because I do n't deserve their loving . It 's a lie . And now , you . God help me , Pertelote , I do n't deserve  --  " She broke in with singing . Her head held high , her mind in flat denial of his talk , she sang the lullaby with rather more brass than before , a verse that damned this weakness with strength from the past . She sang : " He peeled a straw , a summer 's thistle , Blew on it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could n't Build a world secure with wooden Beams ?  --  "  | " Pertelote , do n't ! " the Rooster wailed , his shivering uncontrollable . She looked at him . In the dirty light his face showed agony . " You are special among us , Chauntecleer , " she declared . " You have always been . We look to you  --  " " Ahhh ! " he choked . His own eyes remained closed , compressedin pain . " Do n't praise me . Do n't love me . Do n't remember the past , oh , Pertelote ! I am not worthy of it now  --  " " Not love you ? " keened Pertelote . " I can not love you ? Chauntecleer , what are you doing to me ? " He thrashed his head from the left to the right . " Chalcedony ! " he wailed . " That Hen is a miserable stick , suffering my own neglect . I know my sin . Who 's fault is it if Chalcedony dies ? " " She wo n't die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Chauntecleer ! Do life and death depend on you ? " " They do . They do . " " Oh , Chauntecleer , what kind of a pride is this ? " Pertelote was fighting for her own possessions . " These are unreasonableburdens , impossible to bear  --  life and death . " " I could n't save Russel , " he cried . " So ? " " I lost him . And then I could n't even honor him with a decent burial  --  " " So ? " she cried louder than he . " We all tried to save him . We , none of us , have to carry the guilt . Russel talked . What could we do about his talk ? It was in his character to talk  --  " WWWHUMP ! went the sea . " Shut up ! " screamed Pertelote at the sea . And Chauntecleer shrieked as he tore himself away from her , " It 's Mundo Cani Dog ! " He stood shivering on his own claws , glaring at her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Mundo Cani I ca n't clean from my mind , not from my memory , not from my soul  --  Stop it , Pertelote ! Don'tp117touch me any more ! " She had reached for him . " I know what I am ! " he wailed . Pertelote felt as though the ground moved beneath them , a quake beyond her comprehension . She saw the dark earthworkbehind him , a huge hump and a dead memory ; she noted that the wind was gone ; all in one electric instant , never thereafterforgotten , she saw the sea , the wood , and Chauntecleer between  --  his eye a bright red rivet . " Wyrm had split the earth , " hissed Chauntecleer , " and we looked down , and there we saw him , and I was Lord of this land , but what did I say ? " " Chaun  --  " " I said , Why not ? ' I said , Why not ' ! I stood transfixed before that horror  --  Pertelote , do n't lie ! I stood still before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' I gave up . I surrendered my soul and all the souls of the Animals to death with apostasy and the pitiful whimper , Why not ? ' There was a hole in the earth ? " Chauntecleer drove his beak into his gut , and he cried : " There was a hole in me ! " His eye rolled . " Then who came ? Mundo Cani came . Mundo Cani bounded to the chasm . Mundo Cani taunted Wyrm . He turned Wyrm 's eye  --  and here is the vile truth : all the while I hated him ! Pertelote , do you hear this ? Can you believe it ? This is the truth  --  I despised the Dog . But he is the one who leaped headlong into the pit , down and down where I refused to go , down to the eye of the Serpent . And he is the one that stabbed it , he that spurted eye jelly over himself , he that roused the monster to such violence that Wyrm smashed rock and closed them both inside , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! He saved the Animals alive . And me . He saved my life . " The Rooster threw back his head and cried like a siren : " I loathe the life he saved  --  " The sea toppled a mountainous wave : WWWHUMP-AH ! And Chauntecleer cut his cry in half and struggled to be still . Pertelote withdrew into a little ball , watching the Roosterp118through a screen of grief . Now she knew the cause . And the name . And who consumed him within . Chauntecleer dropped his eye like a flag descending . It was morning . He whispered , his throat thick : " Mundo Cani 's fall was my wrong and my responsibility . " He whispered like little leaves scratching stone : " I wish I could . . . do something . Do something . Go down to hell and say to the Dog , I 'm sorry , ' and bring him home again . Some recompense , " rasped Chauntecleer . " Oh , I would die to purge myself . Dead , I could receive your love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an honest proposition : " Or if the Dog were here  --  Lord , I could be loved again . Pertelote , " he pleaded . " Do you know how much I want to be worthy of your love ? " WWWHUMP ! The sea beat its forehead on the shore . Pertelote nodded . She shook her head . All at once he put his face near the side of hers and brushed her earlobe with primary feathers . " Blood ? " he asked gently . She nodded . " You cut yourself coming here . " She nodded . " See ? " he whispered . " Do you see what I do ? I hurt Creatures . " He gazed at her . " Pertelote , you are God 's kindest thought . He put wings on the meditation he did n't want to lose , and a bright red marker at her throat , and he called her Pertelote . Why ever should such loveliness love me ? " Somehow , these last words were for Pertelote more terrible than any others ; now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head to hide it . But her shoulders shook with the sobbing . He could love so well  --  but she could n't ? Ah , mighty God ! What had they come to ? " See ? See ? See ? " he murmured . " Tears . Well , " he sighed , resigned . " Well , " as though something had been relieved after all , and something accepted : " I do n't have to lay my whole lordship aside . There are two things I can do . I can crow Lauds . I can feed Chalcedony . " Bleak , the future . " I 'll dop119those  --  " he said . And then she did not see , but she felt , that he departed . Enormous weariness takes up space and can be felt  --  here , and gone . He had fought the sea itself that night , and he thought such defiance  --  such love for a carrion Fox  --  worth nothing at all ! She felt that weariness . He had wrestled his phantoms until the breaking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them , yet he had named their names , a monstrous accomplishment . Pertelote felt that weariness . So she felt it also when he gathered them together and bore them away , leaving her to emptiness . Oh , heaven , go with Chauntecleer ! Pertelote lifted her eyes and looked into the emptiness . She saw the wall , the earthwork . Once the golden Rooster had engineered that bulwark to protect a thousand Animals against the Enemy . When it was round , so long ago , the Coop had stood in the center of it ; and they had slept inside the Coop . Pertelote remembered those good nights inside the Coop  --  long , long ago . And now she sang :  --  made love to me so slow and sweetly , Sighing names , he came discreetly Home ; And I to him gave children after ; I it was had cried through laughter , Come '  --  " The sea snagged at the shore . It raised a wave , like the hood and tooth of a cobra , and struck : WWW-WHUMP-AHHHHHH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second part of the book that chronicles descents.  |p123Rachel  Coyote stood at the door of the Den on a small plateau . She lifted her head ; she drew a smile around her narrow snout ; and she listened . Rachel could hear with her heart . With her heart she heard her husband skitter across the plains above , and with her heart she heard him sneak into the forest . Ah , Ferric . He might be quiet as a cloud upon his paws , but his nerves made a crackling static , and his fears fairly shrieked . Daily he went to the forest , now ; and though he never told her why , she understood the secrecy : he was protecting her from the world . Dear , dear Ferric . One day he would laugh . Dainty Rachel , red Coyote , she lowered her head and stepped into the south-running stream . Purposefully she waded down the canyon , turning where the canyon turned . She had her daily secret , too . A dry shelf ran along the water to her left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was near term , now , and rather liked to float her swollen belly in the water , cooling the sensitized nipples . Icicles hung from the sheer canyon walls on either side of her , the water that leeched down through the rock and had frozen drip by drip . These icicles grinned , like rows of teeth , fangs ; elsewhere they drooped like tightly grizzled beards ; farther down the gorge they stood columnar , from the foot to the rim of the cliff . Ice , ice from the world above . Well , it was winter . No one expected respite from winter in this northernp124climate . The days were little and cold and grey ; but Rachel did n't complain because here was a blessing : a canyon stream that kept forever the same temperature , breathing steam into the wintry atmosphere . Rachel proceeded through a cathedral-grandeur , ice pillars rising on the left and on the right of her , her step made slow by the kindly water , which sometimes she paused to lap . Holy clouds surrounded her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head all to one side and smiled and seemed a sacred thing . The babies were moving . This was one reason for her secrecy these days and for her regular walks away from Ferric . The babies moved often , now , and often with surprising pain . In Ferric 's presence she bore the trouble silently , since any hurt in her distressed the poor Coyote past sense . There was no good in Ferric 's knowing that infants trouble the womb . On the other hand , Rachel had a thrilling need to declare that pain , to consider as best she could , to feel , to know every last detail of this exquisite experience , this carrying life , this bearing of babies . Such knowing meant dropping into sudden silences  --  without a husband 's asking why ; or weeping , without that husband 's falling into a panic . Moreover , such knowing sometimes urged sweet Racheltruly to cry out , to give voice to the pain , to hear it in her own ears , straightway to laugh and say , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ferric handle that kind of behavior ? Or how could he ever comprehend that Rachel took pleasure in the hurt , in the hurt itself ; that these tears were dear to her ? Or this , the wonderful thing now dawning on the woman : that suffering is a holy work and graceful indeed ? Let Ferric protect her , dashing bravely through the dangerousworld ; in her way she protected him from knowledge too wonderful for minds of the matters of fact . Even so did she love her husband and her children at once , though the loves were different one from the other.  |p125The  babies were moving , and they were very big . Ahhh ! But how can one keep secret forever her marvelous revelations ? Finally she needs to tell them , does n't she ? To share them , explain them in the ears of an other  --  to validate them , for heaven 's sake ! To hear one other soul agree : " That 's it ! I understand it , too ! " And then to smile together because " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes a life worthwhileWell , that was the second reason for Rachel 's regular trip downstream : such a someone else awaited her at the deep end of the canyon . A plain brown Bird with an extraordinary length of bill and damaged wings had accepted Rachel 's friendship and had given friendship in return . Unto this Bird she told her revelations . And what did the Bird do then ? She hopped to the coat of the Coyote . She picked parasites from the roots of the fur and rubbed oils to the surface and glossed it ; by strong claws she combed the coat of the woman : she groomed dear Rachel unto a shining beauty . She did this patiently and well , who was herself no pretty thing . But this was the way that she talked . This is how she said of motherhood , I understand it , and It is very good . For she had no tongue in her head and all her words besides were " Jug , jug " and " Tereu . " She did communicate , that plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over her flesh with the message . They had become fast friends . Two women bound together , each by a wound in her body , though one 's was peculiar to her and one 's was the genius of her gender : suffering may be  --  aye , suffering could possibly be  --  a holy work , and graceful . So the babies were moving . So the mother floated down to her companion , this day too , to take the benediction of a friendly presence . And so it was that she barked a raw bark while gazing at the plain brown Bird . The Bird was still in her bush , still perched in the wiry tangle that hid Wyrm 's portal , the flue that went down to the Netherworld , the hole that blew one everlastingp126note as through an organ pipe . The Bird had just lifted a crippled wing in greeting when Rachel surprised herself with a bark she 'd not expected . She woofed . Her eyes looked fleetinglyshocked . Then suddenly she hunched her spine , threw up her head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rachel was that the White Wolf Boreas roamed the forest . And what Ferric was doing , daily , was watching the Wolf . He had no notion ever to fight Boreas , huge at the shoulder . His notion , in fact , had been to flee . Oh , he 'd have surrendereda hundred square miles at a pinch and gladly  --  if Rachel had not found her " home . " But she had , and he loved her . So his alternatives were reduced to one , a canny , nerve-wracking observation of the enemy . It was some small advantage , to know and not to be known . But it took all the courage that a poor , skulking Coyote could muster just to approach the Wolf and to watch him . Boreas moved with a slope-shouldered power , his nose near the ground , his white eyes shifting , his muscles taut to the hip , his paw so monstrous that four of Ferric 's could collect into a single print . Boreas moved in casual possession of the whole world round , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slung his tail low : contempt ! Ferric stiffened his tail straight out behind him : tense . Boreas ambled . Ferric Coyote darted thither and yon , ever to keep downwind of the Wolf and upcountry if he could . This is what one knew and the other did not know ; but he who did n't , did n't care ; and he who did , died with perpetual fright . So went the vigil  --  until this particular day , when Ferric 's anxieties doubled with a new discovery . Oh , it was a miserable advantage after all , to know and not to be known . Ferric saw his Wolf in the dead center of a clearing , while he himself lay low between roots . The Wolf stood still , listening , twisting his ears in various directions . He was a stark white Creature , unhurried and majestic . Slowly he lifted hisp127massive head and woofed twice , twice tightening his stomach . He listened again , and then both of them heard a snarling answer : a smug , malevolent voice . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First in black flashes amid the pine , and then whole from his nose to his tail , a second Wolf appeared , coal-black , a bloodredeye , lesser in size than Boreas , but longer in the tooth and the teeth were yellow . This one presented himself in the clearing before Boreas and grinned . " Notos , " growled the White Wolf , and they met . The Wolves were gathering ! Ferric 's mind spun with the implications : expect a pack ! When food was scarce , Wolves drew into packs . This stingy winter encased every edible thing in ice so that no one could scratch a decent meal . Expect a pack ! And then whose den would they be seeking , and whose wife was too fat to run , and who could n't fight to save her anyway ? Oh , yes  --  expect the marauding pack ! The White Wolf and the black one met , and Ferric saw nothing but a gruesome future in front of him  --  and a pack ! His loins contracted . He nearly urinatedAnd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart heard a horror . What , Rachel , what ? he cried silently . Why are you howling ? The world was too full of trouble . Wait ! he cried in his soul . I will be with you ! And Ferric , like a twitching shadow , was gone from the forest . Down the stones flew Ferric , hardly touching them . At bottomhe cut left , scrambling the turn  --  and he dived into the Den . Rachel was there . Oh , yes ; oh , yes , the woman had been howling . Oh , yes , poor Rachel was in pain . Ferric fixed an instant in the doorway , his mouth both open and wordless . She lay on her side , her four legs thrust out as stiff as death ,  |p128her  toes splayed , her fur soiled from writhing around the floor , her fur damp , her lungs pumping , all of her teeth laid bare and grinding , her eyes compressed . This was Rachel , the woman of contentments ! What ? This was his gentle wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he barked , as hoarse as a bullfrog . " Rachel ? " At the sound of his own voice he took to dancing , did Ferric , nervously from foot to foot . And Rachel herself ? At the sound of Ferric 's voice she expelleda long stream of sour breath . She relaxed her legs and allowed her eyes to open . They rolled until they found him ; and then she smiled ; and then she began to laugh . Gentle laughter , like a little brook down pebbles . A gurgling , really ; a happy succession of chuckles ; but laughter nonetheless , over which she closed her eyes again . Ferric was angry . " Tsst ! " he said as some sort of warning . He felt compelled to make a warning . This was n't right . Rachel only laughed more helplessly . He said , " You 're laughing ! " It was an accusation . She nodded . He spoke the truth . He said , " But you 're hurting , Rachel ! " She nodded . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her , both at once : " Well ! No ! You should n't be laughing when you hurt . You ca n't laugh ! " Against the rules . But she could . She did . Until warm tears washed her eyelids , Rachel laughed . Ferric nearly exploded . " What 's the matter ? " he pleaded of her . She shook her head . There was a sigh and a lull in her laughing , but no words . Into her more sober attitude Ferric spoke a sincere opinion : " Rachel , " he said , " I think you have gone crazy  --  " To which she opened her mouth . Ferric expected a yowl out of it ; but a little string broke in her breast , and a brighter , more wonderful laughter than ever poured out . Then Ferric was beside himself , stomping the ground withp129both forepaws together . " Stop it ! Stop it ! " the poor Coyote wailed , so confused . " I think , " he decided . " I think , " he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are laughing at me , Rachel ! " Well , he really did , finally , think that  --  since he surely did n't understand her condition , but she seemed to , and therefore he was the dummy . That was the cry that arrested the woman . She fell into an honest silence . She gazed at Ferric from lying sideways on the ground . All of her , every limb of her , went limp with weariness . She whispered , " Ferric , I 'm happy . And I love you . So I share my happiness with you . You called my name , and there you were , and all my happiness ran out to meet you . Ferric , that 's how my happiness comes out : I laugh . " " Oh , " said Ferric  --  fool . She was n't crazy now , no . So he was just a fool . Because she must be right , but he still did n't understand . " Rachel , " he whispered . " What ? " as soft as ashes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She nodded , and he was empowered to go on . " You 're a mess , and I smell blood in here , and I can feel your hurting , Rachel , all the way down my back , and I can hear your hurting , Rachel , in all of the air around us , like ticking , like terrible time , but you say you 're happy , and I believe you , but I just do n't understand . How can you be happy ? What 's the matter ? " Ferric was trying to be so reasonable . Rachel looked at him with a nearly unutterable love . " Nothingat all is the matter , " she whispered . " I 'm having the babies , now  --  " Ferric 's ears shot up ; his brow , and his eyelids , and his lip all lifted. "  --  which is hard work and hurtful work , but some of the happiest work in the world . See ? " He shook his head . He nodded , expressionless , his snout a cucumber . Babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . Babies.  |p130He  said , " That 's fine , Rachel . " Formal Ferric Coyote . She smiled . " It truly is , " she said . " Now , do n't feel bad , Ferric , and please do n't think that I do n't like you , " she whispered . " But you should go away , now . I 'll do what I have to do alone . You 'd feel worse to stay here . " He nodded total agreement with her assessment . But he stayed put , staring down at her : babies . Rachel 's breath came more rapidly , now . Her great belly began to heave . But she kept her voice a gentle whisper : " Ferric , go . Please . Run to the end of the canyon ; that 's something you can do for me . Tell my friend my happiness . Go . Now . Please . " He nodded . He did n't move . Babies ! Suddenly Rachel sucked a tremendous lot of air , snapped her jaw shut on it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again through a tight , exquisite pain : " Eeeeeeeeee ! " Her tail hooked up behind her . Her body doubled round , focusing all its strength upon the vortex deep within her abdomenBut Ferric was gone on the first point of that scream , as though it had jabbed him in the rear . Zoom ! Coyote-blur between the canyon walls ! Earnest Coyote , desperate to do some job ! He ran with inspiring skill the narrow ledge that banked the stream , his nose straight forward , his tail straight back , leaning into the turns but never missing a footfall , gone , gone , good Ferric Coyote ! As he closed on the southern end of the canyon , where the walls widened into a gloomy yard , nervous thrashings began in a bush , there . A Bird . Long bill , broken wings ; Rachel 's friend . Okay . He aimed himself toward that bush and that Bird . His coming seemed to madden the Bird . She switched the air with her bill , crying , Jug ! " a negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " she chattered at him . He did n't understand . He was a most confused Coyote . But his run took him straight to that bush ; to that bush he went . And though the brown Bird leaped down to his withers ,  |p131from  which she stabbed him in the back of the skull , causing stars of bright pain ; and though she yanked backward on his ears , as if to rein him to a stop , that Coyote roared to her at the top of his lungs : " RACHEL IS VERY HAPPY RIGHT NOW ! " And : " She told me to tell you that . " Ferric lay before a wiry bush with a Bird on top of his head . Waiting . At the right time he was going to go back to Rachel . For the moment , he simply could not sort the crowd that populated his brains . Wolves prowling the winter and the territory near their den , Boreas of perfect power , Notos of a sidewinding malice , the white eyes and the red together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathering . And Rachel tells him that she 's doing a good and happy thing , but it stinks exactly like battle-guts and running blood , and he 's a fool , she 's smiling . And when he goes to give good news to a friend , she tries to peck his little intellect to death  --  then suddenly settles down to nest between his ears : all is forgiven . What is forgiven ? What did he do ? Wolves : potential attack . Rachel : attacked , but happily . But even now he felt her writhing . This Bird , presently picking parasites from his earholes : did attack . But she was the only one named as a friend . Poor Ferric . So small in the universe , so skinny and incapable , confused almost to tears , surrounded by countless dan-gersAndhaving babies . Having babies seemed to blow his little scrap of life into a thousand fragments . Having babies seemed a terrifying multiplication . Ferric was n't sure how he 'd survive the crisis . And why was a Bird on his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all her might to apologize . She truly , truly wanted to guard the hole to hell andp132to protect any other living Creature from the ruinous evil that had engulfed her there . When this bullet of a Coyote came racing toward her , therefore , she could think of nothing but stopping him by any means . So she rode him like a mount and punctured his skullcap , almost drilled him to the brain , which for her would have been unendurable , to sin the same sin twice . She 'd forgotten  --  as the obsessed most often do forget  --  that one 's obsession is n't everyone 's . This Coyote did n't even know of the dire portal behind her . He had other reasons for coming , kindly ones , despite his furious aspect . When he bellowed greetings from her friend , then , she was overwhelmed by her error , and she fell to wiping all the little hurts from off his head . She dearly wished that she had a tongue , to explain . But she had n't . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over his scalp , stroking , picking , combing , scratching , curling his hairs , and killing his fleas . And he lay down and allowed it , and she took that for a sign of forgivenessand was glad . She did : she nested between his ears and finally counted this a glorious day , because she had two friends . In its own good time it came to an end . Gloom rose early in the canyon bottoms , and the evening cold came down like fog . Only a strip of sullen sky could be seen above , and those below quickly became ghosts to one another . The Coyote sat up . The Bird took her leave , hopping again to her habitual bush. lug , " she said . " I think so , " said the Coyote . And he said , " Goodbye . " And she : " Tereu . " Oh , it was a rare gift , to have two friends . She watched the skinny , bemused Coyote creep nervously to his destiny . She wanted to comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having babies . But she had no tongue . Ferric lifted his paw and scratched the stone outside their Den.  |p133There  was motion inside , and a very weak voice said , " Come in , Ferric . " He swallowed . And he went in . Rachel barely visible , Rachel nickered at his entrance in . She was lying on her side , so holy that he drew back , guilty of dust and sin and all the foolery he had performed before . Did he have the right to be here ? But quick-eyed Rachel , seeing him grow slack , said , " Ferric , sit . " He sat . All was still . What a consecrated room their Den had become ! He put his forepaws together and was uncomfortable . Rachel chuckled . He saw the white teeth flash . And then she nudged a damp bunch of something in his direction , using her snout like a spoon . She was so tired . The thing said , " Pweeeee . " She whispered , " Benoni . " And Ferric , squinting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least idea what a Benoni was . " This is your son , Ferric , " she whispered . " Oh ? " he said . A sort of panting began at his stomach , traveling upward . " Your son , " she said . " Benoni , the oldest Coyote . " Then the knowledge flooded him , his throat and his mind together : No , but this is your son ! Ferric wailed , " Oh ! " He stared at the wriggling lump , absolutely struck dumb to be presented with such a thing as a Benoni . The thing said , " Pweeeee ! " And Ferric Coyote burst into tears . Well , Benoni ! You have a face ! And a snarling little snout in it ! And tiny legs with tiny paws , and pads and nails and all ! Oh , Benoni , Benoni ! Ferric lowered his head and licked the Critter with an instant , ineffable love , blubbering all the while exactly like the fool he was n't going to be again . Rachel laughed in a tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pushed daughters toward him . Twill was the name of one , and of the other , Hopsacking . He licked them , all three , tasting Rachel but gazing steadfastlyat the wonders underneath his chin . How do you make life , Rachel ? How do you do that ? It was a holy room , a holy night , a remarkable woman beside him . Hoarsely he whispered , " Can they think , do you suppose ? " Rachel chuckled at the question . " But they 're a helpless mess of pottage , Rachel , and there are Wolves  --  " He bit his lip . He felt the frigid world behind , saw babies before , felt suddenly weak between  --  and choked . " I mean  --  " he said . " Ferric , who do they have for a teacher ? " said Rachel . Well , there was a problem . " And have you forgotten , " she whispered , " how much God loves the little ? Besides , " she stretched herself out , revealing her belly , " these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clicking sound in her mouth  --  and then it was that Rachel was granted her dearest wish , that Ferric Coyote should laugh . For as soon as she clicked , the puppies scuttled toward her . Now , it had taken Ferric the better portion of his life to figure out what nipples were for ; but these three knew instantly : they popped those things into their mouths and settled to sucking with loud smacks and flips of their tails . Ferric 's ears shot up . " Oh , ho-ho , canny ! " he roared . At the end of this tumultuousday , the father plain lost his reserve . He switched from tears to laughter at the perfect instincts of his children . He laughed . He laughed while Rachel sighed . And he bellowed , " Canny , canny Coyotes three ! " Because , who had smarter pups than he ? With wonderful speed Benoni and Twill and Hopsacking grew.  |p135They  sprouted a bright red hair , flecked with rust . They developed pugnacious snouts and little teeth , milk white and needle-sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of their father ; and they ate . Weaned , they were brought to the Bird in her bush , who blessed them with lug , jug , " and then " Tereu . " But weaned they needed a heavier food , and Ferric was n't finding it , and that worried him more than he could say . It was a snowless winter , a dreary , ungenerous winter ; the ice denied him even the bark of the trees , so that he dulled his teeth trying to strip it . But he was a father now , and the children trusted him , him ! How could he be worthy of that trust if his daily trips grew miserable , his foraging more and more futile ? He himself could cease to eat , to be sure . But not the children . No , not the children ; or else , what kind of father would he be ? TwentyCurious Cobb " Two things I can do , " said Chauntecleer : " I can crow the Crows . I can feed Chalcedony . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Squirrel had n't minded when Hens and some Mice and a certain Weasel of immoderate length had collected at the Hemlock tree across the Liverbrook  --  andChicks of a noxious peep . He stood erect at the porch of his own tunnels , and watched the bustle , and he did n't mind . Neither did Pertinax mind frightfully when it became evi/dent that they meant to stay in the neighborhood , troubling the morning with a babel of clucks ( and he stood erect to watch them ) , busifying the day by perpetual peckings at the ground , scratchings , wanderings abroad ( and he scrambled down his side of the stream , then stood up to watch them ) , disturbing the early night with gossip . So sure was he of his not-minding , in fact , that he freely , nay , fearlessly put the question to his wife : Pertinax ran down his tunnels to the master chamber where another Ground Squirrel like himself was weaving matting for the winter . " Mrs. Cobb , " said Pertinax , keeping his voice as innocent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Am I complaining ? " " No , Mr. Cobb , you 're not complaining , " said Mrs. Cobb . " Right ! " he said , and straightway he ran to resume his position , perfectly upright at his porch , confident , now , that he was indeed not minding , and putting a rather more severe twitch , therefore , to his whiskers . Pertinax Cobb had n't minded the golden Rooster either , nor the metronomic regularity of his crowing , because the Bird was beautiful , of a beautiful song , and Cobb fancied himself something of an artist ; besides , he valued schedules and self-discipline . He had n't minded the jolting crow in the early mornings . He had n't minded the midnight broodings ( which necessitated that the Ground Squirrel pop up in moonlight , erect , to watch ) . He had n't even minded ( though this cost him much patience , not to mind it ) that the Rooster never once took a neighborly glance across the stream , in neighborly fashion to greet the neighbor standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that at the cold beginning of the winter  --  when he had expected some relief , since Animals generally retired into a winter 's seclusion , allowingother Animals their peace  --  the whole community began to act as if it were the spring ! Boisterous noise ! Furious activity ! A royal racing about , and a totally untimely scaveng/ing for food . Craziness ! The neighborhood was in an uproar , and Pertinax was displeased . " Mrs. Cobb ! What are they doing over there ? " " I 'm sure I do n't know , Mr. Cobb . " " They 're piling food ! They 're digging bins and storing food ! " " Do you think they are hungry ? " " Why , " cried Cobb , " they 're not eating a bite of'it  --  " Up to the surface he shot . Closely he watched the Hennish rushing , scrutinizing every move , chattering the idiocy of their contratemps . And down he went again . " Nope ! Not a bite , " he declared . " Well then , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do you hear that ? " said Cobb , cocking an ear . " Do you hear him ? He 's the one , you know . He 's gulled them poor Chickens into delusions . Why , it makes a body nervous to be living so close to such nonsense . Him and his crowing ! Mrs. Cobb , tell me straight : do I have the right to complain . " " Well , it ai n't natural , " she said . " And who can sleep ? " he said . " Mr. Cobb , you 've every right to complain , " she said . " Right ! " he said , and he took himself straight to the top of his burrow , where he complained in a mighty and chittering pet . But nobody noticed  --  saving Mrs. Cobb , who loved him . " Chalcedony ! " crowed that golden Lord of the Hemlock  --  quite pointlessly , to Cobb 's way of thinking . " Chalcedony will never go wanting again ! " But then an extraordinary thing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Pertinax 's nature , and the Ground Squirrel was n't the same thereafter . The Liverbrook froze solid , removing a natural barrier between the neighbors . Upon finding that there was a hard path between the Rooster and himself , Cobb ceased chattering and grew in/tensely silent , wondering whether he 'd made a nuisance of himself before , and was he remembered . " Mrs. Cobb , " he whispered , " I did n't complain too much , did I ? " " No , Mr. Cobb , " she said . " You 're the soul of discretion . " " Well , but did I complain at all ? " " No more than was righteous , Mr. Cobb . " " Some ? " he asked in fear . " None , " she said with finality . " Right . " That night he did not stand up on his porch , little Pertinax . He sat in a wad of fur meant to be innocuous , one tiny eye peeping over his own butt , still to watch , being a Squirrel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tussock , a natural piece of terrain . The Rooster , to his horror , did cross the bridge , too stealthy in the darkness to allow a Squirrel 's escape , and stood three yards from him . Then the breathless Pertinax listened . First he heard the breathing of the large Bird . Next he heard the song of the midnight broodings  --  as soft as always , the Rooster sang ; but this time Pertinax could understand the words . He listened with less belligerent ears . He listened in humility , being suddenly unprotected and feeling very small . He listened when the Rooster thought no one heard , so the soul was in his song . He listened , and this is what happened : Pertinax Cobb was moved . It was an eerie flute the Rooster produced . " Often I open my heart and speak my cares , " sang the Rooster , " but there is none to hear them . When I name my memories , they rise before me like visions . My friends are there . But when I reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and one by one they pass into darkness , and I am left alone . Why should n't I be full of woe ? " Strange ! Pertinax felt the night to be peopled , Animals coming and going on the strength of the Rooster 's melody . Even stranger : Pertinax felt sad.  | " Why should n't I weep for the world ? " the song went on so gently . But by some spell it did n't seem the Rooster 's voice any more . In the black night another soul intruded , a mournfulroll of music , a solitary wanderer with no community at all : " Who lives as long as he should ? Or if he does live long , who is n't haunted by the memories of those he lost ? Death , death suffered either way . Alas , for the Pins , the children of my Lady . Alas , for the Widow , the mother of seven , and for the orphans she left behind  --  " Pertinax knew nothing of these names . But they were real . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he mourned them , knowing they were dead . The voice of the singer darkened . He almost thought a great mammal lay beside him . " Alas , for my Lord ! " the song went on . " Where is he now , when I yearn some word from him ? Oh , that he would smile once more . If only he would come and curse me one more time , come love me with his scoldings . " The voice faltered . The Ground Squirrel had altogether forgotten himself . He listened . Deeply , hoarsely the lamentation swelled : Oh , that he would crow one crow for me in sunlight ! But he is gone from me , and who can find me in the darkness ? Who can call me from the Netherworld ? Not one . No one can come near me any moreMarooned ! Pertinax gasped at the sorrow in that word . And then a mystery , a drama occurred in the pitch-black night ; for it seemed that two voices arose in dialogue , each an impossible distance from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling out of the painful incompletion of their love : Mar000000ned ! Have you forgotten me ? " Forget you ? How could I forget you , 0 my heart ? " Mar000000ned ! " Rest . Please rest , perturbed Spirit . Do n't mourn so hope-lessly ! "  |p140Marooooooned  ! " I ca n't stand it any more . " When will you come to take me home ? " When God ! When God gives me the strength and the wisdom , Mundo Cani ! When the mighty God will finally speak to me again . Oh , Mundo Cani . Oh ! Oh ! " Then , silence . An interminable silence . " Do you believe me ? " But , silence . It was that silence , and the terrible desire of the Rooster left unanswered , that wrung poor Pertinax  --  and he made a noise . He sobbed . Immediately the silence changed . It was merely the frozen night again . The Rooster took a quiet step in the Squirrel 's direction , so that he was suddenly , keenly aware of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooster said , " Hello . " Oh boy ! Discovered ! Look out now  --  Rooster-blows are next ! But the Rooster said , " You look sickly , little fellow . You should n't be sickly . No one should be . You would do me a great kindness , " said the Rooster , as gentle as fleece and sincere , " if you 'd come take some food with us tomorrow . " " Mrs. Cobb ! " said Pertinax Cobb , " wake up ! " " What ? What ? Oh , " said Mrs. Cobb . " Did you sleep well ? " " It 's the night , " he said . " Go back to sleep . " " Thank you . I will , " she said . " Mrs. Cobb , " said Pertinax , " that Rooster is a saint ! A blessed , generous , sensitive saint ! " " Do you think so ? " she said . " Mrs. Cobb , I do . " " Well then , he is a saint indeed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rooster . An encounter in the night had expanded his vision violently . He 'd forgotten how many of the meek there were in the world , and how many might starve in a winter of such scarcity . He meant , now , to feed them all . " Wake ! Wake ! " the stentorian crow , made universal by a certain desperation : no , not a single Creature should starve . " Wake ! " he blared beyond the scope of his little community . He stood in the top of the Hemlock like a snapping flag , like a flag that strains at the mast . He rang his command to the whole world round . This was urgent : he would suffer no malingering . Oh , how could he forget his duties to the farther multitudes , Squirrels as stunted as Chalcedony , their eyes glazed over with what ? With want ! " Wake up wherever you are , and work ! " And the first to come on that first day , crossing the solid Liverbrook with happy conviction , were a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday morning in pin-striped coats . They sat up chittering , and then they went to work . " Wake ! " crowed the Rooster in the mornings thereafter . The alarm pealed abroad incessantly : " There 's work to be done ! " And Creatures to do it , too . They came . Some of them remembered the Rooster 's leadership during the summer 's war . Some of them had only heard of it in stories now yellowed to legend . Some of them had always acknowl/edged his lordship , wondering in these latter months what had become of him , but instantly grateful to be obedient again , instantly forgiving him his recent lassitude . Some of them were simply roused by the power of his naked mandate : " Wake ! " They woke . And they came . Chauntecleer is dreaming . Is he ever not dreaming ? He dreams the lonely woman and her meaningless " Tereu . " He dreams the chants of those invisible voices , stony , cold , and passionless as always in his dreams . And still he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conversation in which he takes part , willfully and personally . He says aloud , " I hate this dream . " The chanting , the music , and all of the sound ceases as though the director had frowned , or God withheld his breath . Chauntecleer is at the still center of the universe , where nothing turns . Then there speaks a voice of infinite consolation : " It is distressing , to be sure . " And the voice asks , " Why ? But perhaps you 'll tell me why ? " " Monstrous ! " cries the Cock . " You see me , Wyrm ! Wynn ! I do n't see you ! " " Oh , Galle , Galle , is that the problem ? " The voice smiles at problems easily solved . " Then be at peace . We 're on even ground after all . You see , " the voice enjoys its own joke , " I ca n't see you either . No , I ca n't see you at all . In fact , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you wish to know them ? " For the moment Chauntecleer is reduced to pure hissing by the nearnessof this sardonic voice . " Of course you do , " it persists . " First , there is no light , and who can see anything in absolute darkness ? But second , even if there were , it would do me no good . No , not a bit of it . And why ? I am blind . Utterly blind , " laughs the voice as though this were a delightful turn of events . " Why , Galle , you yourself witnessed the wound that took my sight away . My last picture in all the world is of a Rooster gazing down on me , most brotherly , while that remarkable Dog drops like a bolt straight for myp143eye . Ha , ha ! The Dog put out my light ! But you were the last I looked at . And I think I saw some sympathy in your face . Am I right ? " Chauntecleer shrieks at the picture , not looking down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though lashed . " I 'm sorry , " says the voice . " Is something wrong ? " " Where ? " screams the savage Cock . " Where is Mundo Cani ? " The voice says , " Here . " Chauntecleer is caught short by the ease and the simplicity of the answer . He staggers . " What ? " " Here , " says the voice . " He is with me . I thought you knew that . " With an unearthly intensity Lord Chauntecleer crowed " Come " beneath the slate-grey skies . He thrust his will into the winter slowth ; and the Animals came . Sparrows of jerky efficiency , bunted against the cold , were whipped to work by that crowing , and Chickadees all over the fields . Swallows swooped the sky . The Jay of a nasty mouth , complaining and bullying , could n't avoid the mouth of that Rooster . He came . Fat Partridges ; the Red Squirrel , lean , leaping and selfproclaiming , who had thought he 'd stored enough for the winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty shovels on either side of their heads  --  all these Chauntecleercalled to the mark , and all of them went to work . All up and down the Liverbrook the land came alive . This Rooster had authority and a crow like a lariat : leadership ! The Hens were no longer alone . The Brothers Mice positivelylaughed to be surrounded by such company . And the bald winter seemed , in those days , to have become a holiday after all . They gathered food . They piled food . They made twelve hills of food at least . It was a harvest , at the Cock 's request  --  though out of season as everyone knew ; but Chauntecleer defined his own seasons ! They harvested food , and then they hoarded it.  |p144Seeds  , wheat-seeds , weed-seeds , barleycorns and grain ; berries both frozen aground and dried on the vine ; beans podded and stripped ; fruits softened by the beginning rot , the blasted crabapple , the woody pear , the vinegar pulp of fallen apples ; hickory nuts , chestnuts , beechnuts , walnuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor kernel of the sycamore ; cabbage hearts , sour-dock , meat from collapsing gourds , the rinds of squashes , roots , bulbs , tubers , turnips , beets , herbs , the sweet fiber of young saplings food in surprisingvariety . Who 'd have thought so many things could be food ? But why not ? As many kinds as breeds to eat it ! Food in abundance , mounded in fields , heaped against the Hemlock cliff , cast up along the Liverbrook and waiting the trench that would bury it . Food : and then they hoarded it . Chauntecleer , who had inspired this general scavenging , each according to his own kind , now organized them all into a single kind : he administered a unity of purpose and a fine , effective division of labor . This food was for storage . This food was to be stocked for the future , not given to gluttony now . Therefore the Rooster took himself anywhere they might larder their harvest , and he oversaw the preparations personally . Open seams in the cliff face were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot . And some things ought best to be frozen . And some to be buried deep in the ground " Pertinax Cobb , here . I know holes ! " The digging Animals digged holes . Cobb had contempt for the journeyman work of the Mice . He tunneled great undergroundbins for storing foodstuffs in , rooms of a nearly echoingenormity , well-shored , and floored with pebbles and sticks to keep the food from the moister earth , to allow a healthy draft beneath : marvels of subterranean engineering . " Pertinax Cobb , here . I know holes . " And his wife said , " Is n't he wonderful ? " But the Bluejay screeched at the hatch of the bin , " Move it or lose it ! " And down came the rumble of food . Then upp145popped Pertinax Cobb , chattering of the day when someone would have taken time to admire a job well done ; and besides , Mrs. Cobb had a bruise on her nose . The Jay flipped his tail and flew away for more food . The Rooster crowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Animals wove themselves after all into a successful labor force : what a good thing , to have purpose in this slack , stupid winter ! To have provisions for the scarcest of seasons . To have done it selflessly and together . To have a Lord to lead them in the endeavor ! Did someone say that Chauntecleer defined the seasons ? No  --  Chauntecleer was the seasons . Winterwas n't even a flaw when Chauntecleer warmed and directedthem , so well secured them against calamity . Chauntecleer , that golden Rooster : he was the summer 's sun . " Wake ! And work ! " We have ! We will ! Ah , Chauntecleer , crow and crow and crow forever . " Ho , Rooster ! " cried John Wesley Weasel . Maybe no one was gladder these days than John Wesley Weasel . Surely no one loved pageantry more than he , nor laughed louder , nor beat paws together more vigorously than John in the middle of bright busynesses . " Do and do and do ! " he shouted , slipping here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John alone who had rallied the Animal forces against the Basilisks , who had lost his ear to the Cockatrice and taken a five-inch wound in his side John of the boundless energy . " Haw , haw , haw ! Hee , heel " he roared his delight . " Ho , Rooster ! " he cried to the top of the ridge , where that golden Lord was strutting , yea , at the very edge . He sat up and made punching motions with his forepaws , winking furiously as if there were some private pact between them two alone . Well , this was the joy of the Weasel , to see that Rooster in his glory once again . When Chauntecleer ruled as he should ,  |p146why  then , the world was right . Chauntecleer had taught him manners , once upon a time , and he , John Wesley , had learned . Chauntecleer had been the single Creature tougher , scrappier , louder , more boisterous than him ; so he had learned . And he was beholden to the one that had civilized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater . Loyalty ! Weasels do n't questions loyalty . But when greater collapses into miserable little puddles , then the whole world is confused , and lesser begins even to question himself ! Lesser gets lost . There had been a period of turmoil for the Weasel , then , when he suspected the sanity of Chauntecleer , for he himself was spinning loose in the universe . " Gloominesses , " he was convinced , " blocks the brains . Thinkings makes gloominesses "  --  twoafflictions John manifestly did not suffer  --  " and them what thinks is them what does n't do . " He had feared the Rooster 's melancholy since Russel 's death , and even now mistrustedthe midnight morbidities of the Cock . Ah , but he forgavethem both when the day dawned and his bold Rooster loosed a brazen crow across the land , scuttling a hundred sleeps and scattering Critters abroad in lively obedience . Golden , lordly , unequivocal was Chauntecleer , and loud again , and ruling as he should do . " Ho ! Ho ! Roooooooster ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy again ? Hey ? " But the Rooster kept pacing at the edge of the cliff , back and forth . Perhaps the tumult of Animals had drowned John Wesley 's question . Yet John Wesley truly wanted to know . The last time such organization had been imposed on the Coop , they were preparing for war , fine reasons for fine excitement . They 'd built a wall , then , and provisioned its interior ; and what a wonderfulsummer had ensued ! Fightings and foinings to make a Weasel delirious . So what was coming now ? " Roo-hoo-hooster ! "  |p147A  pumpkin passed him on the left . Mole-dirt moved him from the right . How could the Rooster see him in traffic ? Well , then , go to a Rooster ! John Wesley scrambled a wide way around , west till he gained the hill by a leap ; then he raced upward , going to see his buddy Rooster . " Rooster , " he called to the figure in front of him ; they both were at the edge of the cliff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were alone . " Why-come the Critters , they has to squirrely them dinners away ? " Blunt question . But when Chauntecleer turned , John Wesley hesitated , suddenlyuncertain . The eyes . Rooster 's eyes were still pinched from thinking . They kept sliding sideward . His eyes , they seemed to see unreal things , and was he looking at a Weasel ? " Rooster ? " But he was so beautiful ! " Rooster ? " " Because , " said Chauntecleer , " it 's something we can do . " " What ? " said the Weasel . He frowned doubtfuller still : A nothing answer , and the Cock 's eyes went sliding away again . " Can do ? " said the Weasel . " Can do ? " What good 's a do without a reason ? Well , John had reasons : " Is enemies coming , " he declared . " No , " said Chauntecleer . Flat no . " Enemies ! Sieges , attackings , " cried John , not only because he loved these things , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Blockadings and a bloody bite or two  --  is coming ! " But the Rooster said , " No , John . " And John popped . Such a magnificent comb his Rooster had ! So royal a stride . And power . But thinkings is buggaring his " Somebody does n't drill three hundred Critters for ' Somethingswe can do , ' oh no ! What 's John , a dummy ? Somebody , he does n't move heaven and earth for plain nothings , no . ' Less somebody 's crazy . ' Less somebody , he is crazy . " John drove the thought home by glowering , his own eyes most steady , and he demanded , " So , why-come ? " The Rooster focused . And there was a fire , there ! John saw intensity . Good !  |p148But  the Rooster 's reason was , " For Chalcedony . " The Rooster said , " I want to feed Chalcedony . She 's been hungry far too long . " " What ? " cried John . " Her what 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flame : " My Hen , John ! " Oh , Chauntecleer was a furnace . " My poor anemic Hen ! My own , my own , my own Chalcedony  --  who shall never be hungryagain ! " Confusing . The Weasel glanced down at the mountains of food that banked the Liverbrook , then back at Chauntecleer , who had decreed them . " Nope , " he muttered . " Chicky , she wo n't leave hungry after this some-other meal , nope . " And to himself the cool assessment : " Thinkings buggars the brains . " Then he considered how to save Chauntecleer from madness . He thought : Do  --  which is action . And he thought : Give Rooster reasons for doing , cause for consequence , mouths for all this food ! He thought : " Get Critters for Rooster to rule and he 'll be a ruler for sure ! Oh , John can jam this place with Critters ! John owes him that . John 'll get reasons for so much food  --  " Loyalties . Weasels do n't question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Wesley had made up his mind . Immediately he slipped backward , hardly noticed , then lowered his head and ran north . Chauntecleer is dreaming . When ever is he not dreaming ? " With you ? " he demands in his dream . " Mundo Cani is with you ? " " Aye , with me . And did n't I say so ? " asks the unctuous voice . " He entered my world . He joined himself to me , that where I am , there is he also . I thought you knew that , Galle . It was the exchange that kept your Animals alive . You said it yourself , that he was the ransom . " " Find you , find you , " cries the Cock , greedy at the connection , " and I find Mundo Cani ! "  | " And did n't I say so ? " says the voice . " I love him now as much as you before he became your thorn . Galle , he has taught me a wisdom I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my means for freedom  --  " " I 'm coming ! " blurts the Cock . He strikes a claw into the darkness . " I am coming ! " he cries . " What ? " says the voice , perplexed . " I am coming to take him from you , Wynn ! Look out for me ! " " Of course you are . " The voice has a questioning quality , as thoughthis conversation just took an unnecessary turn . " I 'd be disappointed ifyou did n't . We 've one battle left between us . But why ?  --  " The Rooster is past control . With wild delight he shrieks , " I 'm goingto kill you , Wynn ! " This is the threat . Since Russel 's death , this is the obsession that has consumed Chauntecleer , and lo ! It has been delivered to Wynn himself . He stands poised for any impactInstead , there follows that hollow , exasperating silence . Wynn can be silent . Ah , God ! Wynn can withdraw into occlusion and air . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that he 's being measured . Infinitesimal cock ! Finally , the voice : " You haven ' t asked the third reason why I can not see you . It is the most significant . " Silence  --  and what ? Is he supposed to ask ? He does n't . The voice , this time utterly indifferent : " So . The Cock does n't know as much as we thought he knew . He 's a pest after all . BEHOLD ! " The voice , magnified , thunders down the halls of gloom : BEHOLD ! I AM DOING A NEW THING . EVEN NOW IT SPRINGS FORTH , AND DO YOU NOT PERCEIVE IT ? The Rooster cries , " I 'm going to ki  --  " But the dream has been canceled . Chauntecleer sits in the Hemlock , shivering. "  --  so grateful that you 've turned your attention to the Animalsagain , " said Pertelote , " that you 're raising so beneficial a harvest . Oh , Chauntecleer , you have their hearts and you handle them so well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she roosted near enough to feel the body heat . He was breathing through his nostrils , wakeful . Neither had she been to sleep . The night was bitterly cold . He whispered , " It is n't enough . " " No ? " she said . " Why , I think you 've salted several tons of food away . You 've accomplished a heroic project  --  " " It is n't enough ! " he hissed angrily . She gazed at his form , a shivering , haunted husband  --  but of such remarkable parts . Pertelote breathed a prayer for his peace of mind . And then she argued for it : " The Tags , " she whispered , " laughed today . Is it nothing that you 've given someone the security to laugh ? And Animals were singing while they worked . Chauntecleer , they enjoyed the day . They were not afraid . Is that nothing ? " " The world is still infected . " " The world  --  is always troubled , Chauntecleer . That 's why good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They make a refuge , do n't they ? And the worser the world , the better the refuge ? The more needful a place and faith against confusion , no ? " " The apple has a grub in it , the earth a tapeworm . " " But we are here on the earth . And you are here . And here you 've made a refuge in spite of the troubles , and that is something extraordinary , Chauntecleer , something quite enough  --  because what do you call this thing ? Why , you call it a home . A home . We are home . Ca n't you be content with that  --  and ca n't you sleep then ? " " When I have the right to sleep . " " Oh , Chauntecleer ! Chauntecleer , " she groaned . " I am so tired . " Immediately she was sorry she said that , because he had stiffened . " I 'll go , " he offered , " and let you sleep . " " No ! No , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " " Does everything depend on me ? "  | " Not everything . Me . " " Pertelote , why ? " " Because I love you . " The Rooster sat still within that dilemma so long that Pertelotecould have counted one to five hundred . She had given up hearing another word from him that night when , barely audible , there rose the sigh on the night : " Unfinished . Fraudulent , fraudulent . No  --  it is not enough  --  " Twenty-twoFimbul WinterEvil is not privation . It is not nothing . Evil is a something , has a source . This winter was like none that had ever gone before . The cold was not merely cold , but vindictive : it meant the bite , and ice was a vengeance , and the wind was a willful thing . There was a Deer , a Doe devoutly gentle , who went looking for food , still to suckle her Fawn . She did not nibble at the shoots that were enclosed in ice , because she 'd learned alreadythat this ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched her tongue to it , and twice she 'd ripped her flesh away simply to free herself , because her tongue had frozen against it . Rather , she looked for tree trunks whose eastern sides did n't shine . She meant , finally , to strip bark and eat it . This was all that was left to her . When she found a tree with dry bark , she stretched her neck , curled back her lips , and bit . Something cracked ; pain stabbed her jawbone , and despair sank into her heart , becausep152she had broken her teeth . Even the dry bark was as hard as stone . And this was her despair , that without sound teeth she would not eat at all . She knew in the instant that she had begun to die , and what would become of her child ? What she did not know was that the trees themselves had petrified , that the cold was not merely the absence of heat , but that this cold had its source deep in the earth . This cold was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock and soil to the roots of trees and thence through the trees themselves like a creeping paralysis , like numb death , till the tree stood as a granite monument unto itself , hard and dead . Because death itself is not a nothing . It is not the mere lack of life . It is life 's enemy and as a something takes life 's place . Death hates life . But the sky strained to stay warm in this winter , as though it fought against the cold , and it seemed to weep . But the warring was no blessing for the Animals who crawled between the heaven and the earth , because when heaven dropped a gentle rain , the wind would snatch it and race away , shrieking with laughter ; and the earth , when the water gullied on it , transformed it straightway into ribs of ice . Ice ! A vengeful ice that denied them nourishment . Heaven and earth were battling , and that was the winter . The Animals looked up at the sullen sky . They moaned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said . The Wolves sucked their stomachs upward even to their spines , and they growled , " The Fimbul Winter . " Goats dulled their horns on the metallic ground . Antelopes cracked their hooves in the midst of bounding . Countless eyes went dull , and the children fell ill , and a Stag stood by the body of his wife , his Fawn behind him , and he whispered so that the child should not hear : " The Fimbul Winter . " Coldness of the Cold . Darkness of the Dark . And dying of Death Itself . Wyrm was doing a new thing . Yet even this saturninefamine was not the gravest thrust of his stratagem for freedom . He was wiser than he 'd been before . He knew , if nop153one else did , that even cold the Creatures could love one another , that killing them might only strengthen their love , and that calamity could tighten the bonds between them . Those bonds  --  those were the bonds of his bondage ! They held him fast . And even now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abroad , talking and talking and knitting the Keepers together  --  and they were hearing him , again , on account of the winter , on account of their suffering . No : as vicious as it was , the Fimbul Winter was not his finest subtlety . Not frontally against their skulls would Evil invade them , but rather by entering at the heartWyrm was doing a new thing . Even now it was springing forth . But the worst was yet undreamed of , yet to come . Twenty-threeBondings , BondageA Hare appeared at the Hemlock . He popped up one morning and sat at attention and refused to explain himself to any but Lord Chauntecleer . Pertelote greeted him and tried to put him at ease . " Nope . Nope , " said the Hare , as though ease were not a virtue . His eyes were perpetually startled , looking left and right at once . His ears fairly shouted , like exclamation points , Bang ! Bang ! that he was nervous . " Said I should go straight to the top , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buggars . Said , talk to **33;13674;TOOLONG . Said , Rooster. "  | " Ah , " Pertelote smiled . " You mean Chauntecleer . " " Nope . Nope . Yep . " " He 's down the Liverbrook , " said Pertelote . She paused . She liked the poor fellow precisely because he thought he had little to recommend himself , but he 'd dared the audience nonetheless . Therefore , the coward was brave . " I 'll take you to him , " she said . " Will wait , " he said , " here . " She nodded and went for Chauntecleer . " I think , " she confided to the Rooster as they returned , " that he 's been talking to John Wesley . " " Well . News , " said Chauntecleer . " The Weasel lives . " " No , I do n't think this Hare is much for news , " said Pertelote , and then she stood back . " I , " said Chauntecleer  --  and Pertelote heard the weariness in the word , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes gazed north and south while one stood east of him . " Me . " " **34;13709;TOOLONG ? " " The same . Who told you that ? " " Said 's name was Double-u . Said I could call him BloodyWarrior . Showed me scars . Courageous sort . I came . " " You came indeed , " said the Rooster , not smiling at thescene just painted before him . " What do you want ? " " Said you had enough . Said , more than enough . " " Generous John Wesley , " the Rooster sighed . " Enoughwhat ? " " Well . Well . " Here , on the point of the request , the Hare grew stiffer than ever , flashing glances at the curious Animaleyessurrounding him , and he muttered , " Food . " " You 're hungry . " " Nope . Nope . Yep . " " It 's all right to be hungry , fellow , " said Chauntecleer , and he turned to the Mice lined up behind him , watching . " Tags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them ? "  |p155While  the Mice were gone , Pertelote noticed a moisture in the northern eye of the Hare . Tears  --  and her heart was stirred . How famished were the Creatures of other territories ? She was glad that the Hare had come . The Mice laid the food before him , and still this fixture did not budge . " Well ? " said Chauntecleer . The Hare gave a small cough , and all at once seven others just like him came bounding from the wood , snuck to the food , and ate . The Hare , still at attention , explained : " Kin . " A second load of food produced a second run of shockearedHares ; and a third another third , until the ground around the Hemlock had exploded in fur and wall-eyed faces . They ate . And after they ate , they nestled , for they were every one exhausted . And when they had nestled , they began straightway to doze . All save the first Hare , who continued erect . When finally he bent down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the kin were accounted for and the trick was done . " What is your name ? " she asked . " String Jack . " " String Jack , sir , why did n't you all come openly , together ? " He nibbled painfully , as though stealing the food . " So many . Relatives . Unwelcome , " he said . " Pack and be gone tomorrow . " " Where ? " said Pertelote . He nibbled . He did n't answer that . Nowhere . " Sleep here tonight , String Jack , " said Pertelote , " and tomorrowthis will be your home . " The Brothers Mice gave a cheer : " Huzzah ! " Chauntecleer groaned . Goats appeared at the Hemlock . Some were wire-haired and bony , some shaggy in the coat , all of them with black slots in their eyeballs and bearded.  |p156Nobody  had to invite them to talk . Pertelote did n't have to invite them to stay . And Chauntecleer 's frown grew darker . This breed bawled for food the instant they arrived , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . String Jack and his kin had eaten with fastidious manners , a thousand chews to a mouthful . These ripped , chomped , smacked the food ; dribbled and dropped the food ; swallowed the food with gruntings , and afterward burped up all the food to chew it down again . Then the Goats flopped down and slept . Snored , burped , muttered , and smelled like sour compost . String Jack , it developed , had come from the wilderness west of Chauntecleer 's land . The Goats , who declared that they were of the tribes of Hophni and Phinehas , had traveled from the mountains and the foothills east . John Wesley was busy . A Hawk came whistling down from the sky , stooping at a dazzling hundred miles per hour and striking the fear of God into every little Creature who loved his liver and wished to keep it for himself . Mice and the Ground Squirrel found holes with remarkable speed . Hares went up to attention . Moles thought the first part of a thought . Chickens dithered , Partridgescircled on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , as it turned out when his talons gripped nothing but the ground , the royal Bird had merely been " sent . " There was , was n't there , a Rooster here who flew more skillfully than Hawks and the Swift , who fed marvelously anyonethat asked for victuals ? Chauntecleer muttered , his frown coal black . " I beg your pardon ? " said the Hawk . " I swore , " said Chauntecleer . " I said , Weasel . " " To be sure , " said the Hawk . Chauntecleer repeated what was fast becoming a litany : " What is your name ? What do you want ? "  | " Sharpshin , " announced the Hawk . " Victuals , if you please . " Chauntecleer , still jangled by Sharpshin 's manner of arrival , snapped , " Tags ! " A very busy Weasel , indeed ! And Sheep appeared at the Hemlock , too shy to state their business , but hungry nonetheless . And Pronghorn appeared at the Hemlock . Disappeared when Chauntecleer loosed a swear-word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like springs . They ate nothing but the grasses , which they wound around their tongues with deep gratitude ; and soon they were loving a Rooster as if he were their father . Cats appeared at the Hemlock , moons waning in their eyes , a high-born arrogance in their hearts , but a hunger in their guts so terrible it overcame their pride . Animals , Animals , humble and huffy and craven and crass , embarrassed , demanding , or willing to work , and hungry  --  all of them hungry  --  appeared at the Hemlock . Chauntecleer turned none of them away . But he looked down from the cliff on a thousand bodies and was vexed , because he said , " Who am I to care for so many ? " Busy John Wesley Weasel was racing a long way round the lower apron of a barren moor , exulting in his energy , when one wild sound rang down the mountain and transfixed him . Lonely , long , and full of anguish was the cry , a bugling that thrilled the Weasel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was the haunt of northern winds . Who ? The bugling rose up again . Oh , voices in the wilderness ! John Wesley peered to the top of the moor , and there saw a singular Stag with his head thrust toward the sky , his antlers embracing his withers  --  bugling.  |p158Look  at that ! One black Stag on the mountainside , declaringhimself against the universe ! " Hoopla ! " breathed John Wesley at the sight . And he cried out , " Hey ! " Here was courage he could n't help but respect . Who stands alone against the sky to challenge it ? " Hey ! Hey ! Hey ! " the Weasel shouted , darting across the moor and climbing with happy speed . " Hello , you somebody ! " John has to meet the one he honors , and that right now . A Weasel of compulsions . But that is a Stag of the aristocracy ! One , maybe two , in all the world . " Hey ! " The Stag saw him coming , dropped his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried the Weasel . " John , he 's no troubles . He 's a scrapper too , is John . " Fourteen points , those antlers . Deep-chested , the Creature , and thick in the neck : marvelous . But his eyes were low and suspicious  --  and he did not move . John Wesley was seldom in his life caught off guard . But he was taken by the great black Stag and did n't see the lesser body leap from heath beside him . He was bumped and slitheredforward . Up again in two twists , he tightened himself into a defensive posture and hissed , ready to rip a body apart . " De La Coeur ! " shouted the Stag . A Fawn , a child wide-eyed and terrified , stamped pitiful hooves in front of the Weasel , presenting her forehead as though it had horns . This was the enemy ? " De La Coeur ! " Now John was perplexed . He could drop the Fawn with one cut at the fetlock , and he told her so : " Lucky punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " Baby ! " But she ignored the warning . In spite of her terror she charged him , and he had to scramble backward . " Do n't hurt Papa ! " she cried . " De La Coeur ! " bellowed the Stag . " Baby ! " squealed John Wesley , in the humiliating situationp159of running from a child , John just come to say Hello ! " " Do n't hurt Papa ! " " Papas can fend for them own selves ! " " Leave us be ! " " De La Coeur ! Lie down ! " This was the Stag with final authority , papa and parent , imperious . The Fawn collapsed , so helplessafter all . The Stag said , " He could kill you . " " Right ! " said John Wesley Weasel . " Is stupidnesses to chase John Double-u . " And he sat down as well , to sort things out . " Why-come a baby , she 's fighting for her  --  " He looked at the Stag , who still had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " he said . And then he said , " Oh , Baby ! What courageousness in you ! " This magnificent Buck stood four hooves frozen in a low lake of ice , immobilized and faint from his imprisonment . He could n't have defended himself . This dappled daughter of his had meant to protect him , with her life if she had to . " Oh , Baby ! " John Wesley 's heart nearly burst to see such heroism in an infant . The greymoor , peopled with two souls only , was a stage for the drama of defiance ; and the Weasel was filled with awe . John , " he said , John would n't hurt such fine somebodies , no . " But then , with the next thing he said  --  which he intended as nothing more than a homely and reassuringcompliment  --  he hurt her anyway . He said , " Your Mama brung you up wondersomely brave . " The Fawn drew a sudden breath , then turned her head aside and burst into tears . John Wesley himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't bear to make a baby cry . " Well . Well . Not brave ? " he stuttered . " Not brung up ? Not ?  --  " So strong one minute , so weak the next . Can Weasels ever think up soft words to dry tears ? No . " Her mother , " whispered the Stag , and his head was low to the ground , " died . She lost her teeth and could n't eat . And died . " " Oh , " said John Wesley . " Nobodies told me  --  "  |p160And  there matters stood for a long while , till the Fawn 's weeping subsided into quieter sadness . Well : John should have something for sad Buggars . Sadness wants some action to perk it up . " Well ! " said John . " Then here 's the reasons why John came . Yump ! To set a fine somebodyfree . " He etched the ice around the Stag 's hoof , picked a groove there , gnawed the groove , cracked the ice and released that hoof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Papa ? Nope . " The Fawn had raised her head to watch him . He did the same for the second hoof . The great Stag sighed . Gladly , the Weasel attended to the third hoof , too ; but while he made his rapid scratches , he felt a warm sensation on his back . He looked up and was immediately discombobulated . The Fawn had crept near and was licking him . He coughed . John Wesley Weasel , so skilled in war-craft and belligerence , had never learned how to handle affection . Therefore , he made a savage face and snapped , " Bite your tongue , Baby ! " But he who could n't convince her that he was good , now could not convince her he was bad . She dribbled all over him in gratitude , her eyes both moist and close and huge . He swore , but it made no difference . Thundering , rough-cut oaths , but she kept licking him . He fairly attacked the third and fourth hooves , damning the ice , intimidating the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But then that great body could not support itself . The Stag toppled and fell  --  and John Wesley was saved , because De La Coeur ran to the neck of her father and left him alone . " Babies ! " he said with a whole new meaning . But the couple looked weak indeed , and he could not leave them merely to feed on one another . John Wesley took a deep breath and hazarded again the dangers . Warily he said , " Is Deers , might-be , hungry ? "  |p161They  gazed at him . They were starving . " Now . Now , " he warned , " no thankings John , mind you . No slobberings on a Double-u , who 's a bloody warrior , fightings , brawlings , and so forth  --  " He could n't stand another attack of sweetness out of the Baby . Nevertheless , he described the Lord-and-General-of-All , praising that Rooster extravagantly as foresighted and full of glory , and he directed both father and daughter south to the food bins and to health . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **28;13745;TOOLONG . " " What ? " said the Weasel . " It is my name , " said the Stag . " I give it to you whole , as a gift . We will go and find your Rooster . " " Well . " " Bloody warrior ? " asked the Fawn De La Coeur , from her father 's neck . John Wesley frowned like battle-axes . " What ? " " Thank you . " " Spit to thanks . " So he said . But she kissed him anyway , and the Weasel was gone across the moor like a shot , running on three legs , tryingmightily with the fourth to wipe the sweetness from his face . Chauntecleer crowed the crows . Animals who had never known of Vespers or Compline before lay down in gratitude and wondered that they felt so comforted . Eating was one thing . It satisfied the yearning of their bellies . But these regular signals of the times ordained in goodness , these cries in a kindred voice , were something else . They enclosed the Animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , existence was not a chancey thing but protected by a destiny  --  and the destiny loved them , for it came in the song of a Rooster : one alive ! They mercied them and satisfied the longing of their souls . If winter had n't silencedthis Priest , then what could winter do to them ?  |p162Chauntecleer  crowed . And the Animals slept . Deer appeared at the Hemlock , aristocratic both in their stride and in the cast of their heads , handsome , self-contained . They carried long , ancestral names and a knowledge of their heritage . " Gold-Fess-on-a-Red-Field , " one announced himself ; and another , " Four-Red-Pallets , " and another , " Blue-Bend-Sinister . " One Stag came coated in midnight , with white markings at his muzzle and his breast . His daughter wandered lop-legged behind him , and both were silent , because both were cruelly weakened . But this Fawn , dappled like the autumn , was blameless altogether . Chalcedony , the crippled Hen , noticed the Fawn above all others and felt in herself a motherhood so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held back . She did n't say anything , though she gazed at the child through wintry trees and the desire to love her cramped like pain in her abdomen . She limped ever at a distance , because she thought : what right have I to bother one so lovely ? The Deer are noble Creatures . And fawns grow up to be Ladies . Thus the population multiplied all up and down the Liverbrook , back to the fields and through the deep wood . In fifties and hundreds they camped , each tribe according to its lair and custom , and Chauntecleer appointed leaders over families  --  sometimes with no more than a thrust of his jet beak  --  in order to administer the feeding of so many . An organization developed . Even the children and the aged sped well , and parents took confidence again , and Beasts looked with kindness on their neighbors . But the Rooster said , " I ca n't do this any more ! " Wolves appeared at the Hemlock . That was a complication . The Wolves arrived in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads , prowling balefully through the camp , sliding their eyes to the left and the right . They were a scornful breed , and they caused wherever they went a flurry of distress : meek Animals believe the scorn . Small Animals notice fangs . One of the Wolves was white with eyes like ice chips ; one black with a flaming glance ; one was named , so the Animals rumored it , " Favonius , " and another " Eurus "  --  these four gathered from four corners of the utter distances . A fifth was grey but for deep blue eyes : " Chinook , " a Wolf well collared in thick fur , great in her chest and thigh , slow-pumping at the heart , possessed of an everlasting endurance . Who could run from Chinook forever ? In troubled whispers the Animals spoke of the Wolves ; and when the pack slid by , even whispers ceased . They truly feared these Creatures who roamed the reaches of the earth , who could survive at extremes of the compass and of want . What laws @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivers attended the Wolves , and small ripples of panic behind them . And therefore Chauntecleer charged his crowing with sterner authority and a universal sting . It was n't only comfort he crowed , but the exaction of order as well , so that the maverickmight be contained and the meek feel safe . But that kind of Compline saps the spirit of the singer : it wants so much of him ! Embrace ten thousand ? Prohibit their sins and praise their good works ? Bulk greater than the bad , yet descend to the humiliated ? And keep them generally all from harm ? My God ! My God ! Chauntecleer murmured at midnight , " I ca n't do this any more . " Pertelote heard him . She said , " You do it so well , my Lord . " " I am tired , I am tired , Pertelote . I 'm tired , and in the end I 'll prove unable after all . " " Why ? Because once before you ended poorly ? " " Yes ! I know what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war was not lost , and we did n't die ? You say this even though we sit here alive ? You say this , Chauntecleer , about our victory ? " " I say it ! " he shouted . He paused and softened his voice . " I suffer the future , " he said . " I truly do n't want a one of these Creatures to hurt , Pertelote , not one . But I know the dry rot at the base of things . " " Chauntecleer ? " " What ? " " Can I touch you now ? " " No . " They were nearly enclosed in the Hemlock , since the boughs hung down like drapes , heavy under ice ; and the night was dark . There was a privacy here . Pertelote said , " Is it nothing that I love you ? " He sighed , and it was apparent that even such a question as this sharpened his guilt the more . Nay , it damned him now , right now , as neglectful , terse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Not nothing , Pertelote ; please do n't say that . How could I live at all if I thought that you did n't love me ? I would know whose fault that was , and I would die very soon , because that knowledge would kill me . This is the truth . I am not lying . " Pertelote paused a long time after that confession . A great many thoughts passed her mind , and emotions sputtered in her like fireworks , but none of this showed in her face nor her aspect . Finally , she chose a topic for him and not for herself . " It would be nice if the Dog were here , would n't it ? " she said . He said , " Yes . " She knew how to ease him . " The war could be forgotten then for sure , " she said . " His old , mournful woe would make us feel at home again . Mundo Cani  --  he could run like the wind , could n't he , Chauntecleer ? And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . The Dog loved you . " The Rooster 's head bent . Pertelote said , " And I would hold my husband again  --  "  |p165He  said , " It would be nice . " She whispered , " Ca n't I touch you , Chauntecleer ? " He said , " No . " " When ? " she pleaded . " Oh , Pertelote , " wailed the Rooster , " when I am worthy ! " And she turned her head away and wept . It was in the following night that a Coyote appeared at the Hemlock . Benoni the oldest Coyote began his life in play . Sisters were for biting . Sisters were for cuffing . Mothers were for innocent faces when the sisters tattled . Then sisters were for yanks on the tail when a mother had punished the troublemaker anyway . It was a glad way to be , and sleep was easy , and mornings were right , and the world was good and happy . But very soon Benoni 's attention became fixed upon his father , Ferric ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haggard when he brought them foodstuffs in the evening . Twill and Hopsacking would nuzzle his chin . This was the way they persuaded him to reverse his swallow and to present them with lumps of sweetmeats , which they then fell upon , cracking and chewing mindlessly . But Benoni would hold back . He saw the worry in his father 's eye , and he knew himself to be the oldest  --  an important station in life . Trouble matured the child faster than the months : there wasp166less to eat , so he ate less , even as his father Ferric ate nothing at all . And he smiled less . Rachel watched her son . She saw him to be thinking more than he ought to be , a Pup borne down by burdens . And she noticed that he woke up when his father woke in the morning . And she understood that he hated the shortness of his legs . While Ferric stood high on the rim of the canyon , staring eastward with obvious tension , Benoni whined at the lowest stone , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched , and his tail went down with the effort  --  but when his father launched and left , Benoni stood still on hind legs and cocked his ears and listened . What could he hear ? What did he think ? " I 'm going to lose him soon , " thought Rachel . " Too soon . " She tried to keep things gay for all her children , playing with them herself and prodding them to speak whatever came into their heads . But Benoni spoke less than his sisters , now . He watched the rim of the canyon . She led them daily down the stream , splashing in the water that held its warmth and singing thoughtless rhymes . Daily they visited the Bird in her bush , whom the children called Aunt , and who would pick through their soft fur like a clicking scissors . She loved them absolutely . Their laughter sent her hopping all over the bushBut Benoni began to lag behind when the women set off southward on a morning . And he seemed to recognize a differencebetween himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " Do you think your aunt is silly , now ? " Rachel asked when she returned to find her son sitting at the bottom step . " No 'm , " said Benoni . " Are you bothered by your sisters ? Are they too foolish for you ? " " No 'm . " " But you would rather be here than with us ? " " Yes 'm , " said Benoni , uncomfortable.  | " Why ? " " Oh , " said Benoni , " I 'm older , now . I 'll  --  I will watch out for the Den . I can be alone , sometimes . " " Yes , you can , " said Rachel quietly . She gazed at his soft , earnest face . " What do you do when you are alone ? " " Think . " " Ah . It 's a grown-up business , to think , " she said aloud . But to herself she said , " Soon . Too soon , " and her eyes went sad . She prayed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly the world would snatch him from her . One afternoon when the mother and her daughters came splashing back to the Den , Benoni was gone . The mother 's manner changed . No . This was too soon ! With two sharp barks she ordered Twill and Hopsacking into the lair , where they were to lie perfectly still until her return , then she dashed up the stairs and raced the plains , the thought of her baby by her heart : " Noni ! Benoni ! " The ice world was both grand and deadly . The pine were silent . She trotted into their dark interior , but then she did not know where to go . " Benoni ! " Echoes laughed . Ice cracked . A load of crystal crashed to the ground , and Rachel ran headlong : " Benoni ! " The baby 's legs had grown to match his yearning , and he could climb the stones , now . But his wisdom did not match this world . Why had n't she demanded that he stay with them , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what he liked . What mattered was his safety  --  but the Pine were mighty and blind and careless of a mother 's child , " Benoni ! " Niii ! Niii ! " Where are you ? " You ! You ! " Benoni , tell me where you are ! " She heard a faint wail to her left . She froze . Again : it sounded so vulnerable . It was Benoni . Rachel sobbed , thenp168broke in that direction . Extraordinary leaps she took over hillocks and across the ditches . Quick , efficient arcs she describedaround the pine . And she ran . And when little Benoni saw her coming , he cried , " Mama ! " and darted toward her , a red pellet with serious eyes , so that they collided , and the pup pushed himself hard into his mother 's chest , deep and deeper , he would n't quit pushing . She held him , gazing upward . She said , " Where were you ? " He shook his head . She said , " Were you lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he burst into tears : " Whoo . Wh000000 . " Oh , how Rachel gathered her son so tightly under her chin ! How dearly she pressed him in . " I was so afraid for you , " she said . Ice slid from the treetops , smashed on the ground , and the baby jumped . Bones and glass rained down around them . His sobbing went straight to her soul , and she swore he would never cry again , and she knew it was a lie . She whispered , " Were you running away from us ? " He shook his head . " Oh , Benoni , did n't you know that this is a hurtful world ? " she asked . He nodded against her chest . " Yes 'm , I knew , " he said . And gravely he explained , " It 's why I came . " " What ? " Rachel backed away from her son , to look at him . " What ? " she said . He averted his eyes . His fur stood out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than a trigger cocked ; but he was a deep little Coyote . " What ? " she said . " To be hurt ? " " No 'm , " he muttered . " But to help Papa . " " Whisht ! Your Papa needs help ? " Benoni bowed his head , embarrassed . He nodded . " Why ? Is he so weak ? " " No ! Not weak , " cried Benoni , gazing at his mother to bep169sure that she knew he did n't think his Papa weak . Then he said , " He 's  --  afraid . " Rachel could say nothing to this . Soon , she thought behind her glittering eyes . Too soon . " I came to help him fight the enemy , " Benoni said . " But I did n't find the enemy . I did n't find Papa . I turned around this time and that time . I turned around too many times , " said Benoni , his lip beginning to quiver . " I got lost . " And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wh00000000 . " He crept back to his Mama and curled himself beneath her neck . She stroked him , his fine , red fur , and wished that the need would never , never end . " Benoni , Benoni , " she whispered . " Who is the enemy ? " But at that moment and in that place , the pup had run out of words . He could say no more than his Mama had said . He , too , said , " Who . " And he sobbed , " Whoooooooo . " Ferric  --  far away from his family , but gone on account of them , to find food  --  was trying to eat a pine cone . He had a sour expression on his face . The thing stuck out from his jaw like the abdomen of an enormous insect , its scales scraping his tongue , and he was grinding it soft at the middle . Tasteless and mean , the pine cone ! A bitter dinner for anyone . But what else was there in this deep-frozen world ? Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his teeth . His eyes watered up . He was miserable , forever conscious of the nasty food he brought his children , and always afraid that this would be the last . Suddenly the floor of the forest trembled . And the Coyote froze  --  the pine cone like a dead wing at his cheek . Who was this ? It was no Wolfsprowl that he felt . The Wolves had left . Besides , whoever was coming took no care to be quiet . Boisterous ! Careless ! Tramping the earth as though he owned it . Happy !  |p170Someone  mighty ignorant , thought Ferric in his freezeAnd then a long , brown Animal bounded into view , jaunty on four short legs , smug at his snout , flashing a black eye . He had but one ear , the size of a nickel , but so much energy that the Coyote cringed and wished that he had run . " Ha ! " cried the traveler , and he stopped . " What is here ? A wooden Critter , what ? Does you move , wooden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who hid the harder  --  and yanked his tail . He punched his stomach , saying , " Hum . Hum . " He tickled the bony ribs , and Ferric 's eyes flowed water . But he kept his freeze . " Well , well , John Double-u has seen him some curiosities in his adventuring ; but wooden Critters is somethings new , you bet . Hello ! Hello ! " he shouted into Ferric 's face , as though raising his voice would help . " HELLO ! HELLO , WOODEN CRITTER . DOES YOU TALK ? " All at once this " Double-u " sat back in astonishment and poked his head up high and hung his paws at his breast , the better to consider . " Look-ee here , " he whistled . " Does n't move . Does n't talk , tsk-tsk . But what ? By Gaw , it cries . Little tears raining down . Wooden Critter is sad . JOHN IS SORRY FOR YOU , TOO ! Might-be , teeth gots stuck on a piney-cone , and ca n't eat no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IS SOMEBODY MIGHT-BE HUNGRY IN THERE ? " For a long moment the one-eared bellower stared at Ferric , tipping his head left and right , waiting for an answer . The Coyote nearly cracked , to be stared at so directly . How could it be that one single Animal could turn this lonely forest into a party ? " Okay . Hungry , " said the traveler , satisfied that he had hit upon the problem . He took a deep breath . " LOOK-EE , " he roared  --  and with much gesticulation he explained where food was . He praised the golden Cock in charge of it , and rattled on about the great company of Animals already gatheredthere beneath the jurisdiction of the Cock , how content they were , so to be fed , so to be ruled.  |p171Ferric  , imagining so many Creatures like this one to be all in one place , hissed a little : " Tssssst . " " NOPE ! " shouted the traveler . " IS NO THANKINGS FOR JOHN , NO SIR ! JOHN , HE DOES HIS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WARRIORS IS ALWAYSON THE MOVE . " Then , true to his word , the traveler left as wonderfully as he had come , muttering , " Does n't talk . Wonders if wooden Critters knows how to listens . Wooden legs , wooden brains  --  " Ferric ached . Society itself had come and gone in the person of a long Animal . The forest fell darker , now , and quieter , in his absence ; and Ferric sat down , still sucking the pine cone . So , there was food to the south . Food for the feeding of his children and his Rachel . Oh , but what a terrifying way to get it , dodging the eyes of a thousand Beasts , daring the dangers , the dangersFerric swallowed his pine cone . He looked up at the trees for another . It was deep in the night when this father descended the canyon stone to home ; it was through darkness that he heard his son 's voice saying : " Papa ca n't fight the enemy alone . " And it was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fight the enemy , Benoni ? " So says the Cub ? " asked Rachel in the Den . " So says the soft-paw ? " " Do n't make me little , Mama , " said Benoni . " You are little , Benoni . " " I 'm older than I was . " " Whisht , my son , not old enough . " " But me and Papa are two . I should go with him . He ca n't fight alone . Papa is scared . " There . That paralyzed Ferric on his own doorstep  --  scared ,  |p172Benoni  ?  --  too shamed to go in , too much in love with his son just to go . Benoni ? Instead he stopped where he was and listened . " Scared , " said Rachel with much greater ease . " Of what ? " Benoni whispered seriously , " The enemy . " Rachel lowered her voice . " Benoni , " she said , " who is the enemy ? " " I do n't know . " He lowered his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch Papa 's eyes , staring at something I never seen , something so bad that Papa 's afraid of it . I feel so sorry for Papa  --  " Ferric Coyote sat down in darkness and hung his head . He heard a long pause pass , and the rustle of Rachel 's settling herself . " Noni ? " she said . " I am here , Mama . " " Will you come lie by me ? " There was smaller rustling in the Den . Then , softly , " Noni ? " " What , Mama ? " " I do n't think you need to be sorry for your Papa , " she said . " Perhaps you do n't understand why not , nor what a special Coyote your father is . Benoni , " she said in a very terrible whisper . " What ? " he said . " I will tell you who the enemy is . Listen . The enemy is the Witch with No Stomach . " Silence . Benoni squirmed at the horror of this news . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robes of air and goes through the forest bending the trees as she passes by . Sometimesher robes are as white as the mist . Sometimes she goes softly , and no one is afraid . Sometimes she screams through the branches and breaks them and hurls them down to the ground . Then no one can sleep , because the Witch is angry . And what do you think she is looking for ? " " What ? " said Benoni . And Rachel said , " Why , children . "  | " Oh , " said Benoni . " Children who have left their Mamas and their Papas and wandered off alone . Children with no one to protect them . Children who thought that they were older . " " Oh , " said little Benoni . " There was a Bear Cub , once , who thought that he was older . He went into the forest and got lost . When the night came , so did the Witch , whipping her foggy gown from tree to tree until she saw him . She shrieked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think the Bear Cub saw ? " " What , " whispered the Coyote Cub , " did he see ? " " Nothing . He saw nothing at all . That 's why they call her the Witch with No Stomach . In the middle of her is the place where Nothing is , a frightening sight to see . All of the Nothing of the world comes from her middle . Well . Then she circled her sleeves around the lonely Bear Cub ; and this is what the Witch did then : she ate him up . " " Ate him up , " said Benoni . " Up , down , and gone . And nobody saw him after that because , of course , she had no stomach , and little Cubs , when they are swallowed down inside of her , go Nowhere . " " Nowhere , " said Benoni . " Nowhere at all . Nothing is in Nowhere . Nowhere is where Nothing is . And Nowhere is the Stomach of the Witch . The little Bear was Nowhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can it ? " " Oh , no , " said Benoni . " Of course not , " said his mother . " Therefore the Witch was never full . So next it was a youngling Hawk she ate , and after that a Badger , and pretty soon all of the children of the forest , whishty ! were gone . " Rachel fell silent . The silence lasted long , since Rachel was a patient mother . But Benoni was not a patient son . " Is that the end ? " he asked . " Well , " said Rachel . " Well , it might have been the end . Except for one mighty Coyote . "  | " Oh , yes ! " sang Benoni . " A mighty Coyote . " " Listen . All the mothers of the cubs came together , and they wept and wailed for their children , and the whole forest shuddered with their sorrow . What will we do ? ' they asked . Oh , what will we do , ' they answered themselves . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am strong , ' he roared . I will beat up the Witch with No Stomach until the children come home again . ' But the mothers were wiser . How can you beat her up , ' they asked , if you ca n't take hold of her ? ' The Bear put down his head and shuffled away . No One could take hold of the Witch with No Stomach . " A Hawk came forward . I am swift , ' he announced . I can fly as fast as the Witch when she blows through the forest . ' But the mothers were wiser . Can you be everywhere and nowhere at once ? ' they asked . For the Witch shakes all the trees and all the branches at once . ' No , the Hawk could not be everywhereand nowhere at once . No One . No One could be nowhere . " And No One could talk to the Witch . And No One could find her . Animal after Animal failed to be the right one to save the children , since all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mothers to do ? Who could help them ? " " Someone ? " said Benoni . " No , " said Rachel sadly . " Not Some One . " Poor Benoni felt sad , too . " No One ? " he asked . " Right ! " cried Rachel with surprising praise . " Right ! No One ! No One was the only one who could beat a Witch , or else be everywhere at once , or talk with a Witch , or find her . No One . No One alone ! Oh , Benoni , you are so wise . " And here 's the beautiful part of my story , " said Rachel . " Within the forest there lived a humble Coyote . So humble and scared was he , that whenever they asked his name , he mumbled , No One . I am No-One-At-All . ' And when they asked him if he was good at anything , he said , Nothing . ' And when they asked him where he lived , the lowly Coyote said , Nowhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mothers cried , No One , you 're the only one ! None of the Some Ones around can save our children , because they know nothing about Nothings , but you do . Please find the Witch with No Stomach . Oh , let No One go ! ' " Well . In no time at all , No One went Nowhere : he went to utter humiliation , which is the Witch 's stomach . And there , most bravely , he did Nothing At All , which to him was as natural as loving children : No One never tried to do that . He took hold of a Bear Cub 's paw , and a youngling Hawk , a Badger , and child after child , he raised them from the Witch 's stomach , back to their mothers  --  " " And the mothers were happy ? " cried Benoni . " So happy , " said Rachel . " So happy . " Ferric heard that they were hugging in the Den , because his son laughed aloud at the story and grunted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forelegs . " Mama ? " asked Benoni the oldest Coyote , much less sad . " Benoni ? " said Rachel . " Is that a true story ? " " Well , " she said , " one way it 's just a story , and I made it up . But if you think that the Witch with No Stomach is the wind  --  or maybe she 's the winter that 's eating us now  --  then I suppose that it is true after all ; and then I 've shown you the enemythat frightens fathers , have n't I ? " The cub fell silent a while . Then , " Mama ? " " Benoni ? " " Well  --  is Papa a mighty Coyote ? " " Your father ? " said Rachel in the dark Den , hidden . " Your father , Noni ? Whisht , he has a great heart , child , full of the love for you . And he is your father . This is the truth : Ferric is mighty among all of the Creatures on earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the door of the Den , pine cones once before their swallowing . She understood their number on sight : one for her , three for thep176children , and one for the Bird in her bush . None for Ferric himself . He had gone . At midnight Chauntecleer the Rooster wanted to be alone . Night after night he escaped the overwhelming duties of the day not by sleeping but by walking down the hard ice of the Liverbrook alone . He muttered to himself . He stopped and puzzled and came to no answers . He shouted at God , throwingout his wings . He carried the thousand spirits of the Animalsin his breast . And he asked nothing at midnight so much as to be left alone . The Animals who had gathered realized his need , though they did n't understand it . After Compline they nestled to their sleep , and they left him alone . Nobody troubled the troubled Rooster . Therefore , Lord Chauntecleer was not pleased to see a shadow cross the stream in front of him . It went from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment it went from the left to the right , a quick wrinkle in the night . Then all was darkness again . But his solitude was gone and his attention was stuck downstream and the frown was stuck on his face . While he walked , while he watched , that shadow shot five more times across the stream . He counted the times , growing more and more irritated : some busy Creature ! Some idiotic shuttlecock ! The seventh time the shadow passed , Chauntecleer fixedp177his eye on the wood where it went and rushed to the spot with a great flurry of feathers . Between two trees , in dim light , he found a frozen little Beast thin as a tweezers and stiffer than toothpicks . He put his Rooster-eye to the Creature 's slant-eye and snapped , " Good night . " It was as gentle a command as he had at the moment and should have been sufficient . Any stronger , and he thought he 'd shatter a fellow so brittle and fixed . " Good night ! " The Rooster turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the LiverbrookAnd then was thunderstruck to see the same small Beast ahead of him , frozen in the same position , this time squarely in his path , though not a sound had passed between . " GOOD NIGHT ! " roared Chauntecleer at this piece of sculpture , using bombast after all . " GOOD NIGHT ! " from thirty paces , and then again " GOOD NIGHT " from a foot . " Good night ! " as he continued downstream . Well , if the commanditself did not inspire obedience , then the Rooster had to drop a detonation or two to force obedience , Roosterlyfashion . Curious , however , that the Beast did not budge , no , not a quiver , despite the impact of Chauntecleer 's nearest  --  Good God ! There it was again . One hundred yards ahead , still in that same egregious crouch , a tinder-box of tensions , an aggravation to the midnightCock , a Beast in very danger ! Chauntecleer bore down on it . Arguments flooded his mind . This time the Creature moved : the tiniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the point of his snout . And he said , " Tsssssst . " " Ha ! " snapped Chauntecleer . " So wire can make a sound . Ha ! Can wire also untaut itself , and go away , and go to sleep ? You can eat in the morning , with all the Animals  --  "  | " Tsssssst ! " " What , you do n't like that ? " thundered the Cock . " What , you think you 're something special ? Listen to me , you insignificantNit : neither you nor anyone else is special . Good night ! Nobody 's special ; everyone 's special ; or no one would survive . **30;13775;TOOLONG night ! " But suddenly a sort of fit seized the little Beast , a shudderingand a writhing within himself . At once Chauntecleer feared that he had overwhelmed the fellow , and remorse  --  the same old , immediate guilt  --  poured through him . With all his heart he repented again his habit of hurting the meek , and his soul turned within him . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he wanted to touch the Beast , to apologize and to feed him at onceBut this trembling was not a reaction . It was willful . And the little Creature was not so much suffering from something as suffering toward something . He was in a mighty struggle , all the while gazing at Chauntecleer ; he was battling desperately to what ? To do what ? Why , to speak ! All the groaning and twisting and striving produced one word : " Rachel . " And the Beast bowed down and sighed . " Rachel , " said a tender Chauntecleer . He picked the word up as a precious thing , since it took so much effort to create it  --  and since he had almost ignored this one of God 's Creatures . " Rachel ' : a very important word , I see . The name of someone , and she is important . Are there others ? " Well , that was another nearly impossible task . But this little Beast was uncommonly tenacious . He fought hard and long , first to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopsacking , " and with a final effort , " Bird in her bush  --  so hungry  --  " Then he sat down in a haywire heap , faint for all he had accomplished . Chauntecleer looked upon him and was moved . What love this fellow must have for a Rachel , so to sacrifice himself thisp179way , enduring Rooster-attacks and overcoming even his own nature . Skinny could be very , very strong . " You are a Coyote , " said Chauntecleer . The Coyote nodded . " Coyote , forgive me for what I said before , " said Chauntecleer . " You are special . " The Coyote shook his head . " You do n't know , " said Chauntecleer . " But I know . You have done a remarkable thing for Rachel . " He sat down before the Coyote , to put that one at his ease , to make amends . Here in the night he gave a Coyote his whole attention . " Therefore , " he said , " this Rachel must be a remarkable Creature . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good conversation . Chauntecleer pursued it : " And the Benoni whom you speak about must also be exceptional . " The Coyote nodded , almost to the point of smiling , now . " And there 's a Twill , I perceive . And someone of noteworthybeauty named Hopsacking  --  " The Coyote was nodding with glad volubility . " And a Bird , " said Chauntecleer , " the only one whose name you have n't told me . Perhaps you 'd like to chat a little with me , " said the Rooster , further to comfort a Coyote , " and tell me her name , too . " And Chauntecleer succeeded . The frightened Coyote lifted his face in honest pleasure to the Rooster and spoke . He smiled and said two words which stunned Lord Chauntecleer no less than a spike to his brain . The Coyote said , " Jug , jug . " " What ? " said Chauntecleer . The Coyote said , " No name for her . She ca n't talk . Poor Bird has no tongue . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jug , jug , ' " he said , drilling the Coyote with an immoveable eye . The Coyote 's smile slipped a bit before this intensity . He said , uncertainly , " It 's what she says . "  |p180The  night stars loosened and began to wheel around Lord Chauntecleer . The woods and the earth rose up to float about his ears . The universe was tipping , and the Rooster felt as though he would soon explode for the thing occurring . He bit hard against his excitement and whispered hoarsely , as carefully as he could , " Again , " gazing at this Beast , this oracle of God : " Say again what the woman says . Again . " Jug , jug , " whined the Coyote . Chauntecleer let a laugh slip out of his solemn face . It sounded like a bark , and the Coyote shrank . " Jug , jug , " he stuttered , " and Tereu . " The Rooster 's beak drove closer to a Coyote , so that a Coyote fell closer to a freeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight about to rupture , " she 's sad ? I mean , sad ? " The shrinking Coyote nodded one minimal degree , and that was the end of communications for the night -- because the Rooster blew up . Lord Chauntecleer rose on his wings , laughing loud and long and lustily , a geyser of joy : " And you know where she is ! And you know how to find her ! And here you are ! My God , my God ! " roared Chauntecleer . He soared into the sky , he whose flight was usually lumbering . He flew high enough to see dawn at the eastern horizon , and his heart burst for the seeing of the dawn . He cried , " 0 my dear God ! " and he meant it . Then he swooped to the topmost branch of the tallest tree of the highest rise around , where he stood black against the greydawn , and he , Lord Chauntecleer the Rooster , gleefully took dominion of the world . " JUG ! " he crowed a new crow . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wings swept out . His lungs were brass , and Lauds broke bright upon the gloom , and Animals were jolted awake , and the sun himself seemed tardy : JUG , JUG  --  OH , WYRM , I 'VE FOUND YOU OUT , AND I AM COMING ! MUNDO CANI , HERE I COME TO YOU ! TEREU ! TEREU ! TEREU ! "  | " Mrs. Cobb ! Did you hear that ? " " Aye . It woke me . " " What was it ? " " I do n't know . I truly do n't know . " " Should a body go investigate ? " " I do n't know that neither , Mr. Cobb . " A pause . " It could be dangerous . " " Could be . Could be . Probably is  --  " Deep ponderings in the Squirrels ' burrow . And then , a memory : " I saw lightning hit a master-elm , once , " Pertinax Cobb said carefully . " The light blinded me , shot down the tree trunk in a flash  --  cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went with it that I tumbled backwards . For a second all was quiet , like sleeping . But then , Mrs. Cobb , that there elm , she sang out . A screeching  --  a screeching , like I never heard before . And what should I see , but the elm tree splitting , heavy limbs on one side , heavy limbs on t' other , gone splitting slowly down the middle  --  screeching ! That , Mrs. Cobb : that , I swear , is the sound I just heard again . " Pertinax Cobb 's wife shuddered . Cobb said , " It wants investigating , does n't it ? " Mrs. Cobb said , " It does . " " I 'm off , " said Cobb . She said , " Can I go with you ? " And he : " I should be grateful , if you did . " Down the Liverbrook in the dim greydawn stood a single figure : Pertelote the Hen , gazing southward . She was holdingp182her breath , her wing at her throat , herself as silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her from behind " Chauntecleer , " whispered Wodenstag . He did n't move . Seven little noses were pressed together in star formation . Fourteen eyes were open to the darkness . Forty-two whiskers twitched . The Brothers Mice were wide awake . Wodenstag had spoken first . " Well , I think so , Wodenstag , " said Freitag . " Chaunte-cleer . " " Crowing , " said Samstag . " Far , far away . " " But when did he crow like that before ? " said Freitag . " The Rooster  --  the Rooster , he never crowed like that before , " said Wodenstag , " unless it was when his children pleased him  --  " " Oh , Wodenstag ! " cried Samstag , the youngest of them all . " I am so happy . You should feel how my heart is beating . " Every Mouse began to wriggle . The star expanded . " And do you know why you are happy ? " whispered Wodenstag , full of awe . " Why ? " said Samstag . " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven Mice . Down the frozen Liverbrookthey darted , around a bend and straight ahead , where they saw three Creatures sitting still , facing south . Their poor hearts were tripping away , yet they restrained themselves and with a grave formality took places behind a Ground Squirrel . She turned and smiled a greeting upon them , then she pointed to the other Squirrel , so stiff beside the quiet Pertelote . " Mr. Cobb 's investigating , " she confided . And the Mice suppressed giggles of glee . What a marvelous occupation , to be investigating !  |p183There  was a Hawk whose head came up to the daybreak cry like a gun-hammer . His stern eye flared with the light of gladness , and his whole body trembled to soar . Goats heard the ram 's horn . Goats heard the trumpet which once had blown the battle-note so wildly that it cracked stone . Goats woke with that sound in their hearts . They took to their hooves . They stamped toward the Liverbrook . The Pronghorn leapt straight from their sleep . The whole herd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eyes of String Jack popped out of his head in opposite directions . " What  --  ? What  --  ? " The flanks of the noble Deer began to shiver . The Sparrows chittered ; Partridges made silly bubbles in their throats ; the Jay plain laughed ; the great camp of the Animals awoke in all of its sectors , and stirred , and wondered at the good feelings and the sweet anticipation running through them  --  and , grinning , they followed a general flow : rank upon rank , in tribes and families , by breed and by individualwish , they came and filled the valley of the Liverbrook . " What  --  ? What  --  ? " But Pertelote stood the foremost of them all , stood silently in patient grace : waiting . It was Chalcedony the crippled Hen who went close enough truly to see the woman Pertelote . And the sky was brighter when she came . She had no thought in her head save to sit near the kindest heart in this vast congregation  --  but when she saw the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their own accord : " Ma'am ! " wailed Chalcedony . " Ma'am , oh , ma'am ! Why are you crying ? " Then came Chauntecleer . That Rooster strode the Liverbrook as one in full posses/sion of the land , his jet beak shut . upon some glorious news , his tail a fountain , his white nails flashing , his eye clean , bright , and pure . Lo : he had arisen from his gloom . Who could be sad any more ? He was the sunlight coming home , bursting twice his size . Who could look upon such a Lord and not smile ? White breath puffed faster and faster from Animals ' nostrils . The excitement tingled through them . Someone giggled . Everyone waited . But Chauntecleer leveled his gaze and took deliberate time to approach the one in front of them all . Pertelote . Silently he stopped before her . He nodded twice . With her eyes , which were brimming with tears , with her eyes alone the woman questioned him . She searched his face , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put out a wing and brushed his neck : Can I touch you ? He did not draw back . Again , he nodded . So then it was that Pertelote lowered her head , and like a child moved very close to him . And it was he who swept her into a full and mighty hug , he who buried her head in his breast . Her shoulders began to shake ; she was weeping , unashamed . The Animals saw that , and many of them , too , began to weep . But Chauntecleer raised his head above his wife . " Oh ! " he said with a grand pride . " Oh , Pertelote ! " He closed his eyes below the sky , and then this is what Lord Chauntecleerdid : he opened his beak , and he laughed . The Rooster burst into a long peal of rolling , uncontrollable laughter . He breathed , and he laughed again . So then the poor Animals were crying and laughing both at the same time , whose mood had been so dreary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crying because their Lady was so glad . And a new sound rose up above the land that day , a deep and throated , holy sound , the whole camp participating , none left out , none louder than the others . And this was the name of the sound : it was Joy . " Ahhhhhhh , Chauntecleer ! "  |p185Now  , lightly , Pertelote herself walked down the ice of the Liverbrook , carrying Chauntecleer in her heart . " I 've found it , " he had whispered in her ear . " Pertelote , I have found my Something to do . " These words were for her alone , since she alone had known the torment of his soul . " Be glad with me . " She was exceeding glad . And he had asked her to go and comfort the small outlander that waited a half mile down-ice from them : " He holds the key . " She 'd nodded at the request , and he with perfect love had kissed her . He kissed her . He gazed into the deepest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then they had parted , Chauntecleer leaping like fire to the crown of the Stag Black-Pale , crying " Ho ! " to all the Animals ; Pertelote walking south in singular wonder . Now , walking , she heard behind her the slow roaring of the congregation . That sound pursued her like the waves of an ocean , for the Rooster was calling to the Animals and they were answering . He was an orator , as in the old days , holding them by the mere force of his language , his vision , his desire . " Ahhhhhhh , " she heard : one giant throat , a completely harmoniousveneration . They would follow him , and that was something . But that he was willing to lead them , why , that was something else again . Chauntecleer had chosen the office andp186was glad to be in it ! Chauntecleer was alive . " Ahhhhhhhmen ! " Dear God , thought Pertelote , bending her neck in the prayer : what gift has given the Rooster hope again ? What " key " has accomplished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old days " Ahhhhhhh-men ! " When she lifted her eyes again she spotted the outlander , fixed between the naked , wintry trees . He was a Coyote , twisted into the most ghastly contortion , stiff and grinning at once , and flicking his eyes between the distant roaring and her own approach . And here is the grace of Pertelote : that , in spite of all the glories of the morning , her heart went out to this Coyote , and she cared for him . She paused . " Are you afraid ? " she asked . Not a hair of the Coyote moved . " Do you think that I might hurt you ? " Sticks and bones was this Coyote , thin as a razor , sunken eyes and hungry and , indeed , afraid . So Pertelote sat down ten yards away in order to show that she meant no harm . " No , no , none of us would hurt you , sir , " she said , smiling . " Do n't mind my tears . They are happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a pitiful guilt sat in the corner of this Coyote 's eye , as though he were asking , What have I done ? But he said nothing . He cowered . Then the Rooster roared , and she saw the ears twitch to the distant declamation : SOMEWHERE THERE 'S A WAY , cried Chauntecleer . I HAVEDREAMED ITAh , the Coyote was listening , too . So Pertelote said to him , " You 're very important to Lord Chauntecleer . To all of us , really . Somehow , sir , you 've given him hope again . Do you understand that ? " He blinked . For an instant the poor Beast truly looked at her , and she poured words into the opening.  | " I do n't know what your goodness is , " she said , " but I think  --  I am convinced , sir  --  that I 've been praying for you to come to us . And look ! You have come ! "  --  DOWN TO THE NETHERWORLD , THAT WAY  --  they both heard the Rooster 's Cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND ONE OF THEM EVIL " See ? Do you hear that ? Do you hear the strength in my husband now ? " she said , and she thought she saw the ghost of agreement in his grin . Impulsively she spoke the frank truth to this stranger : " Oh , how I love him . I love him so much , " she whispered . He heard her . He dropped his eyes before her confession and relaxed  --  and dear Pertelote recognized the kinship . " Why , you too ! " she said . " You love someone too , and someone loves you . Is n't that wonderful ? We 're not such strangers after all  --  " WYRM ! the Rooster tolled that word like a bell . And WYRM ! thundered the Animals . Pertelote heard , but Pertelote was also caring for the Coyote . " You did n't come here for yourself , did you ? " she said . She rose and took three paces closer to him . " You came for someone else , did n't you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we 're not strangers . Who is she ? My beloved 's name is Chauntecleer . What is the name of your beloved ? " The thin Coyote relaxed and sighed , and a thoroughly lonely shadow covered his face . Ah , the outlander ! He was homesick ! MUNDO CANI DOG ! roared the Rooster . And the Animals answered , MUNDO CANI ! She heard . Part of her had never left that convocation . But part of her remembered homesickness and suffered with this Creature . " You are thinking of her right now , are n't you ? And you can see her , too . Dear sir , let me see your beloved . " The Coyote raised his eyes , and he and the Hen were looking at one another . " What is her name ? Tell me her name , " said Pertelote.  |p188But  in that same moment the blaring of the Rooster carried a dreadful message to Pertelote , and she went up on her toes as though stabbed . She was listening . I WILL ! I WILL ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NETHERWORLD , AND I MYSELF WILL KILL THE EVIL ONE , AND I WILL SET THE GOOD ONE FREE ! The Hen staggered for a moment on two legs , then listed and sank to the ground . " Chauntecleer ? " she wailed . She covered her head in her wing . " Chauntecleer ? " The Coyote saw all this and stood up . Pertelote shrank . One sob , like a spasm , shook her , because she lay in a void . Then it was that the Coyote spoke . " I 'm , " he said . " I 'm sorry . Not his fault . Not his fault  --  but Pertelote could n't tell him that . She could hardly breathe . Not his fault  --  but she was drowning in her knowledge . This was his Something to do ? Go down to Wyrm ? Oh , that Cock ! Then he was going to leave her after all , and who did he think he was , that Cock ! That overweening Cock ! So self-centered in his mopings and his guilt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyrm ! So blindly penetential that he could forget her , forget her heart ! But she had loved him . " Chauntecleer ! " Incredibly , the little Coyote crept to her side , and touched the Hen lightly with his paw , and whispered , " Tssssst , " with sympathy . Whispered , " Rachel . " The Animals were tumultuous in twice ten thousand voices : AHHHHHHH-MEN ! But the memorable word , and the one that Pertelote never forgot thereafter , was the little word of a kind Coyote , seeking some way to console her : " Rachel , " he said . " Her name is Rachel . " Rachel . Pertelote started to cry.  |p189He  had sworn an oath before heaven and all of the Animals , and he was persuaded that Wyrm had heard it , too . Now there was work to be done , and one day to do it . Chauntecleer sent Black-Pale on a wide , magnificent run , while he himself rode banner in the antlers . They made a complete circuit of the camp , Black-Pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind , his wings laid back , his eye narrow , his comb smoking . He was flame . This was a day of unspeakable sweetness for him , though there was sadness too : he was taking his leave . He crowed constantly . He wanted to lift the spirits of his Animals in spite of the bitter winter ; more than that , to convincethem of strength and purpose and grandeur and color in their lives , to unify them with the sense of their own significance ; but most of all , to proclaim the good news that the Rooster had changed . He 'd taken hold again . He was in startlingcommand . The times ! The times themselves were changing  --  and by a single , extraordinary act he , Chauntecleer , would see to the health of the Animals forever . He was taking leave . But he wanted to leave them faithful and whole . " Mundo Cani shall come out of the depths ! " he crowed . " Then who can hurt you , when we have triumphed over Evil , face to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts ! When Evil is dead , there shall be no Evil any more . And the Dog shall be the sign of it . Watch for the Dog . Remember that I told you to watch for the Dog ! " Bright , incendiary Rooster , scorching the land from the topp190of a traveling Stag ! And the Animals believed in him . They laughed . Their eyes were stars , their voices full of worship , and their hearts burst . They said , " The spirit of God is upon him . " Then who could resist his excitement ? None . Neither two nor two thousand . He asked none of them to go with him tomorrow , because the battle would be his alone . This time he would enter the breach . It was his obligation and his oath . But neither did he deny any happy heart the right to attend him , and many talked of going . And Chauntecleer , flushed with leadership , could play it two ways that day : not only did he handle the Animals as a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one as well , individuals in need of individual attention . Having circumscribed the whole community , he entered it and walked among them , talking . And then it seemed that he was everywhere . Gentle words for String Jack and his kin , who shied from noise of any kind , even the glorious kind . He requested Sharpshin the Hawk to fly pilot for any that would run north with him in the morning . Sharpshin was proud to accept . He suggested that the Goats take baths . The Goats announced that Hophni and Phinehas , their forebears , maintaineda faithful sobriety from water of any sort . They were content to stink . He noticed the Fawn De La Coeur , following at a distance but hanging back with a troubled eye upon her father . He strengthened the will of the Sheep . He encouraged the Pronghorn to closer quarters with other Animals . He met the little Coyote on a lonely stretch of the Liverbrook , was mildly surprised to find the Beast alone , since he thought that Pertelote was with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of convincing the Coyote to wait , to stay . The poor beast was desperate to be home again . He seemed at the end of self-control . A little food was all he wanted , andp191leave to be gone . But since eloquence was lost on him , Chauntecleertried friendship , first , and then the simple command that the Coyote had no choice but to wait . They would go together , at the right time . The strange Coyote cringed , both from the " together " and from the order " at the right time . " But Chauntecleer allowed no debate on the matter  --  too much depended upon this Coyote 's knowledge !  --  and the Coyote stayed , watched by two Deer . Oh , where was Pertelote to pet and to keep this Creature ? By the Canonical Crows , Terce and Sext and None , the Rooster ribbed the day , giving it a fine round shape . But each crow wounded De La Coeur , ever close behind them , and Chauntecleer felt sorry for her . He declared a feasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Animals ate , and the chatter around their mouthfuls was happy indeed . But while they ate , the Rooster spoke a different word to the Mice , whom he appointed to manage the larder in his absence . The word was wise , but it troubled them because it also seemed so final . They were just Mice . " A little hunger today , " he said , " is better than famine tomorrow . Tags , be as frugal as possible with the food hereafter . Enough to live on and no more . " They were walking to the Hemlock , the Rooster and the Mice , and the Mice kept looking at one another , questioning . " We do n't know what the future holds , do we ? " said Chauntecleer . The Mice all shook their heads . They knew very little of anything . " If , " said Chauntecleer , " I say , if I do n't come back again , then you must make this food to last a long , long time . I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they nodded automatically , but their eyes were very big . " And I trust your integrity , right ? " They nodded . " And you are mature , now , and I respect your maturity , is n't that so ? " Poor Mice , they nodded and nodded , and they blinked , and they nodded . They looked afraid . " Good , " said Chauntecleer . " I know I wo n't be disappointed . " In this way he gave each Mouse a manhood . They couldn'tp192talk to him just now , having so much to turn over in their minds . But neither did they cry . And so they came to the Hemlock . Chauntecleer sighed with a certain satisfaction . A good day . A good kingdom . Good , good Animals . It was going to be fine after all . They would fare well , and they would remember him , please God , with honorBut then he noticed one little Hen alone , and it troubled him . Facing the stone cliff and shivering helplessly was Chalcedony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one for whom he had gathered so much food ! No , he was n't done , yet . The Rooster went and stood beside her , a Rooster and a Hen together . " Well , " he said , " we are sister and brother for sure now . " She stared at him , astonished . But he simply smiled . " I did that , " said Chauntecleer . " Oh , yes . Ever since the winter began I have been shivering just like you . See ? The cold was in my bones . I know how you feel , Chalcedony . " She opened her beak and closed it again , gazing at him . Hoo ! He was so close to her . " But here 's hope , " he said . " I 'm warm now . " She tore her eyes away and bowed her head . " It 's not , " she confessed , " so much as I 'm cold , m'Lord . It 's somewhat a different matter  --  " " Shoosh , shoosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We are alike . I was cold because I was weak ; and I was weak because I was sad . Like you . " Her head came up . He continued to stare at the wall . The shivering grew worse in her , and she marveled : " You ? You was sad ? " " Me , " said the Rooster . " O00000 , " said Chalcedony . Then Chauntecleer narrowed the subject . Directly he asked her , " Why are you standing here , so sad ? " She sighed and shivered terribly . The day was dying intop193quietness , the evening heavy , now , and grey . It seemed as if the whole world were hushing to hear of Chalcedony 's sadness . Chauntecleer turned so that his beak was an inch from hers . " You can whisper , " he said . Gentle Lord Chauntecleer . And she did . " On account of  --  my beautiful Lady was weeping , " she whispered . " On account of  --  I do n't know how to comfort her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't expected Pertelote to appear between them . He had n't seen her all day long . He had n't even thought of her , except once , and then in irritation . Chalcedony 's goodness was better than his . " Well , " he said , " what if I went to comfort her ? " " No , I , I , " the little Hen insisted . " How often was n't I the one was weeping ? And how often did n't she put me in good cheer again ? ' T is once , just once , Chalcedony should dc somewhat for her Lady . " She sighed . " But there 's not nothing in this body for to give , you see . That 's the truth , and that 's the sadness . I 'm a cripple after all . " " You are my Hen , " said Chauntecleer immediately . " Yot : are my sister . " " Please , sir , " whined Chalcedony . " Thank you for that , bui I know what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nowhere near my Lad for worth . Do you think that you could go away now ? " Chauntecleer did n't move . He kept his head by hers , anc the longer he stood the more distressed she became . " Do I upset you , Chalcedony ? " he asked . " Oh , sir ! Oh , sir ! How could you think such a thing ? " Shc jerked her head in confused embarrassment . " Did I make yor think that ? " Her tiny comb reddened . " No ! It 's , why should you spend time with me ? This is no Lady here , nor nobod worth noticing . That 's what it is . " She was near tears . " Maybc you could just go away now ? " Chauntecleer looked at her with honest love . " I will b ( going away , " he said quietly . " But I want it well with yoip194before I do , Chalcedony . You are a good woman , and better than you know . Wait here . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it but you . Wait . Wait a moment  --  " The Rooster backed away from the Hen , nodding his wish that she should stay just where she was , then turned and searched among the bodies of the Animals . They had begun , now , to buckle their knees and to lower themselves for sleep , though a general buzzing hung above them , and that was excitement . The lowest Animals lay in shadows . Chauntecleer looked for antlers , fourteen points , a minor forest  --  and he found them . Black-Pale stood still and silently . His daughter De La Coeur was gazing at him , as she had the whole day through . Nothing had been said between them ; that was clear . But there was much that should be said , and that was clear as well . Tomorrow was no easy day for either of the Deer . Both were suffering . Chauntecleer went and touched the Fawn . " Child , " he said , " Will you walk with me ? If you walk with me , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to her father , who neither restrained her nor set her free . The Stag was mute . He was not a Creature who displayed his feelings . Chauntecleer said , " You love your father . " She tipped her head to one side and nodded . How young was she , and vulnerable ! And Chauntecleer said more quietly , " And you miss your mother , too . " The Fawn hung her head in memory . She missed her mother . " You see ? " said Chauntecleer . " I am wise . I understand these things . And I know even more than these . Come . Be brave , child . Let me say them aloud while we walk . Come , walk with me . " Slowly , at his gentle urging , the long-legged Fawn followed him , though often she threw backward glances to her father :  |p195such  pride and such a forest of antlers black against the dusk ! Chauntecleer said , " You heard that your father is going away tomorrow , though no one told you this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is . He will carry me north . Now , here is the hard part : you are afraid that he will not come back again . You think that maybe he will go the way your mother went . You do n't say this , of course , because maybe that would make it come true . But you fear it . And then you would be left alone . " Chauntecleer looked at her in the darkness . " Do I speak the truth ? " he said . She stopped and sighed . " Do I ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " See ? " said Chauntecleer . " See the things I know ? " She nodded sadly . Indeed , he knew very much . " Now , listen to me while we walk , " said the Rooster . They walked . " It 's with me that your father goes . I will watch over him . I am very wise , De La Coeur , as you have said yourself ; and I will send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With enormous eyes she blinked . " Do you ? " he said . And she said , " Yes . " " Good , " he said . " That 's settled . But that 's only the half of it . I know , I know , I know . The other half is : who will watch over you . " The Fawn drew a breath . Chauntecleer had touched every worry in her . He was a surgeon of the feelings . " Please do n't stop listening to me now , dear De La Coeur , " he said , " because I have an answer for that too . I 'm a very wise Rooster , you see . " They had come to the Hemlock tree , and they had to stop . There was nowhere else to walk . " De La Coeur , child , can you say hello ? " said Chauntecleer . She nodded . " Practice , " he gently urged her . " Say hello . " She said , " Hello . " She gave a silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait here . " He went to the Hen Chalcedony , and he touched her . " Come with me , " he said . The Rooster and the crippled Hen walked to a Fawn . " Again , " he said . " Hello , " said the Fawn De La Coeur . " Well ? " said Chauntecleer to the Hen , and Chalcedony curtsied , somewhat flustered to be introduced to this highbornchild , the object of so much secret affection . " Hoo , sir , " she whispered . " Is this right ? " But Chauntecleer ignored the question . " While I 'm with your father , " he said , " this Lady will be with you , and you will not be alone . Child , she is even wiser than I am and so much better in the eyes of God . " Then , to Chalcedony : " Love her . Please love and care for this child , dear Chalcedony , with all your heart . Neither you nor she should be lonely , do you hear me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my Lord ! I do n't know what to say . " " Say , " said Chauntecleer , " that you have a daughter , now . Someone to comfort . Say that you are not nothing . And sometimes in the night , when you two are together , say , Chalcedony , that I love you . I do . I wish you believed it . I do . " He left them , then , and went to the other side of the Liverbrook ; and he waited , his head bowed . In a little while he heard first the Hen and then the Fawn . The Hen said , " Does De La Coeur fancy a snack now and then ? " The Fawn giggled . And Chauntecleer was finished . Oh , the leader loved his own . Vespers . Chauntecleer lifted his voice like a trumpet across the land ; the frigid darkness took a glory , and all of the Animals paused in their night-talk . " Listen , listen , " they said . " It 's Chauntecleer . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep nor the grave could trouble them then , for they were kept.  |p197Did  anyone fear the absence of their head in the days to come ? No more . Did anyone think that they had no purpose in the world , or love ? No more . Was anyone ignorant of the name of Mundo Cani , soon to stand among them , living and loving them again ? Was anyone too fainthearted to cry " Wyrm ! Wyrm ! " in a curse , to taunt the Evil One in his own lair ? Why , even the Sparrows spat his name , then giggled . And the Hens above all yearned for the Dog to come and touch them and weep at their whiteness . Could anyone suffer the hopelessness of the dreary winter ? No more ! Chauntecleer , trumpet of the imperium , convinced his entireland of possibility , and then of peace . He blew one keening note so long , that women found themselves to be sobbing before it was done , and their husbands held them , and the whole congregation of the Animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the darkness , and so began the night . Only  --  Pertelote was not on her branch . Pertelote had not returned . Twenty-nineNightThe Lady had spent her day in loneliness . As soon as she realized the magnitude of her husband 's ambition and the consequences that must come of it , she could n't so much as speak to the Coyote . Talk simply wasn'tp198in her . And she dreaded to face Chauntecleer . And everything else in existence diminished . Ten thousand Animals were nothing , nothing . She wanted only to be alone . " I 'm sorry , " the Coyote had said . She could n't thank him . She could n't ask how much he loved his wife , Rachel . Love had become such a cruel thing to her . She left . Altogether dazed , she wandered the Liverbrook south through the woods , and south until it met with Wyrmesmere , the sea now frozen to its bowels , humped and yellowed and silent . The cold goes deep , my Lord . Then she walked westwardon the plains . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her face was numb . Her heart was numb . The cold goes deep , my Lord . In time she came to the old earthwork , the wall her husband once had engineered against the enemy when hope and a certain warmth had bound them all together . There , on a whited ruin , she sat down , and she sat merely . For the rest of the morning she held her peace . But at noon , under a grey sky , while picking at her feathers , she suddenly threw up her head and wailed , " He wants to fight Wyrm . What then ? 0 Lord ! 0 please , my Lord ! The cold goes deep , my Lord , my Lord . " And she burst into tears . She was angry with Chauntecleer . It seemed that she hated him , hated him for his childishness and his everlasting obsessions . She wept until her throat ached and the tears went dry and the sobs came in separate spasms ; and this was several hours . In the afternoon she wrapped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sang :  --  made love to me so slow and sweetly , Sighing names , he came discreetly Home ; And I to him gave children after ; I it was had cried through laughter , Come '  --  "  |p199She  closed her eyes . What would she do with all her memories ? Ponder them ? But then , in the darkness , the beautiful Pertelote heard the distant vespers of Lord Chauntecleer . That trumpet shudderedher as well as any other , its last , longest note literally taking her breath away . It must have reached to the end of the earth . And he , she understood , was persuaded of his holy enterprise . He was bounden to it . He was crowing creed . So she said , " We 've had our tears . Enough . Enough . " She lifted her head . She stood up with slow resolution . " It is his decision , " she declared out loud . " His honor , his purpose , his dignity . So . I will not trouble him with my troubles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did at the beginning : Chauntecleer is Chauntecleer . " The Hen walked to the site where the Coop had stood before the war . She measured the ground from one corner and found a hollow covered by woven branches and sealed in ice . With a sudden strength , she smashed the ice ; and then she picked the weave apart by jerks of her claw . When she had torn a hole in the earth-pocket , she drove her beak into it and withdrew two utensils of leather and metal . Yet , for all her resolution , Pertelote could not help despisingthe taste of that leather . This one night Chauntecleer did not seek solitude down the Liverbrook . He sought Pertelote . This should not be a night alone ; he wanted her body next to his , and forgiveness if she could give it , and the assurance when he left tomorrow that there was peace between themBut he did n't know where to look for her . The wood and the world were huge after all . The sky was starless . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever been a woman unto herself , quiet , private , and never truly claimed by the land . By the marriage , yes ; and by motherhood , when that was a reality ; by friendship , but not by the land . She could have gone anywhere . Pertelote , born and raised in another place , a woman al/ready when he met her  --  Pertelote carried memories in her that he would never know . She 'd never made much of her past , except that it had been difficult and that it was over . Yet because a part of her was secret from everyone , the Lady always seemed something of a sojourner in Chauntecleer 's land . Not his . She was not his Hen , but wholly her own . Then she could be anywhere . He should n't have neglected her during the day . He should n't have taken her for granted . He stood on Liverbrook ice a perfect fool , paralyzed by his ignorance . He had no idea where to look for her , and the world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pertelote ? " Then a little sound touched him on the back of his brain . It was so tiny that he did n't hear it . He suspected it . He screwed his eyes to the darkness . " Hello ? " Tink . There : downstream the Liverbrook . There . And not ice only . The ice had grown so old it lost its crystaline quality . It sounded lumpish and wooden these days . Tink . That was not ice . Tink , Link . Chauntecleer went to his toes and stretched his neck . He cocked his head to stare with one eye and then the other . The sound was regular and ringing , delicate , metal on metal . Pertelote ? " Pertelote ? Is that you ? " Who else would come with such a delicacy ? No one ! Chauntecleerallowed himself to grin . He did n't deny a flush of joy , and he began to run toward the noiseAnd here came a darkened figure , walking slowly the bends of the stream , beautiful , sure-footed , sure-spirited : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , two metal pieces at the ends of these , striking one another as she walked : Link . Tink !  | " Oh , Pertelote , " Chauntecleer cried , overcome by thewoman 's goodness , her simply being there . He choked . She said , " I thought you 'd want these . I 've polished themfor you . " " Pertelote , " whispered the poor Cock . " Sit , " she said . " Sit down , sir , and let me have your ankle . " He sat . He loved her . He loved her touch , but he could only shake his head . With efficient skill she bound a terrible spur to Chauntecleer'slower shank , a gleaming , reaching weapon named Gaff . By this weapon he had killed the Cockatrice . She drew the leather tight with her beak . To his other leg she tied another , this one named the Slasher , no less fearsome than the first , and a yank made it tight , and then she herself sat down , silently . She was done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Then you approve ? " Pertelote 's own voice was not missing . Nevertheless , she waited before she spoke . And then she said , " I ask only that you do not do this thing in madness . That you are not mad , Chauntecleer . " " Touch me , " he said . " Do I feel like a child or an idiot ? " She did n't touch him . She said , " It 's not the Cockatrice . Wyrm , this time . You are going to fight Wyrm himself . Do you know what you are doing ? " " Yes , " he said . " That he is the Evil One ? " " Yes , " he said . " And what the consequences of such a fight must be ? " " Yes , " he said . " Perhaps I 'll set Mundo Cani free . " " Perhaps , " she said . She closed her eyes . " But that 's notwhat I mean . " " No , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say it , " she said . " Say it aloud . " And he said , " I will die . "  |p202She  said , " Yes . " She said , " Thank you . " And then her whole body shuddered , but her eyes stayed closed , and she did not cry . " You will die , Chauntecleer . " Neither touched the other for a while , because what were they , now that the truth was spoken ? Husband and wife ? Widow , corpse and comforter ? What were they doing here ? Remembering ? Cherishing ? Taking leave ? Chauntecleer was the cause of this . Therefore , Pertelote had to speak first , because he did n't have the right . When she did , it was in a diminished voice . " Tell me the worth , Chauntecleer , " she said . " Tell me the need . " And he was conscious of the depth of her question . For both of them , the Rooster chose his words with scrupulous care . " For righteousness , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penance . " He thought through his answer . So often Chauntecleer had acted in passion , afterward justifying the act . This one time , for this extremest venture , it was necessary that he explain himself first and clearly . " My life has been a shameful thing , Pertelote , " he said . " I 've been a sickness in the land , and who 's to say that all our sorrows do n't find their source in me ? It is wrong , wrong , that Mundo Cani moans in hell . It is wrong for him , wrong for the earth , wrong in the order of things . And it is my wrong . And what can I do about it ?  --  " He stopped . He wanted to speak few words , not many . He did not want to protest , only to explain . " Unless I die , " he said slowly , " then all this life is a death . Do you understand that ? But if I sacrifice myself , then this life was something after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do one thing right  --  and the best thing of all ! Otherwise , " he said , " how could the Animals live in peace ? Otherwise , " he whispered , " how could you love me ? " Pertelote fairly wailed in her anguish , " But I do love you ! " " I am someone now , " he said . " No ! " she cried . " I loved you all along , no matter what youp203thought you were ! Do n't scorn me so much as to think I 've been blind . I knew you , and still I loved you . " " When I ignored you ? " " When you ignored me , of course ! You were here , were n't you ? " " Pertelote ! " he said sharply , stopping her . " This is me . This is me . This is Chauntecleer , finally ! This is the way I should be . I 've taken an oath . I 've challenged Wyrm in a sacred vow , to fight him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find him and to fulfil the oath  --  to be ! In dying I will be . This is me . This is my being , now . This is my purpose , my justification , my goodness , my goodness , to fight and to die  --  " " Ahh ! " gasped Pertelote as though she were falling , and Chauntecleer rushed to her . He caught her in his wings , wrapped her all around and hugged her tightly from the ice , from the night , from tomorrow , from the terrors of this sinful world , from fear . He had a boldness in his heart , now , and by that boldness he wished his wife a perfect peace . Oh , God ! It was so good to be holding her again . And when she allowed it , when finally she shaped her body to his own , he nearly wept for gladness : he was her husband , protector again ! He squeezed her till he trembled . And in this wave of loving her , he whispered , " Sacrifice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is n't madness , is it ? " She did n't answer him . And still , she did n't cry . He rocked his beautiful Pertelote and whispered a litany of names . " Lord Russel the Fox , " he said . " Him . The Wee Widow Mouse . Nimbus and Beryl , that humble Hen . And the Rat Ebenezer , whom I do not forget . And the thousand , the meek and the faithful thousand . And the Turkeys  --  " He chuckled to himself . " Our children , too , the Pins , the First , the Second and the Third : they shall none of these have died in vain when I have met their murderer . Is that madness ? " She shook her head . " I hear how you name them , Chauntecleer , " she said . " I hear how deeply you care for them . But youp204always did . But this thing , this obsession  --  " She stopped . Slowly Pertelote returned his hug . He felt the warmth coming to him as a gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and now the tears did run from his eyes , for she had chosen ; he had not demanded . " You are my husband , " she whispered . " I am your wife . I love you , Chauntecleer . That is not madness . " " 0 mighty God ! " the Rooster cried . " Watch over this woman ! Never , never let her go ! " And then , while they clung to one another on the Liverbrook , their backs to the weather , he said , " You sang to me once in my desolation . Do you remember ? " " I remember , " she said . " Do you think that you could sing to me again ? " That night Compline was a tender shock for all the Animals . It woke them , gently , then composed them for a yet more blessed sleep . It was sung in a woman 's voice . Pertelote did not crow or cry out or lift up her voice in the treetops . It was crystal , ringing clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crystal bell. "  --  For safety I commend my friends , Their spirits , sleep , and all their ends , To God ; And him whose life myself I live , His name Sweet Singer , most I give To God  --  " Chauntecleer inclined his ear and swallowed . It was an exquisitebenediction , to hear his name within her prayer , as though he were eavesdropping upon her love for him . When the singing had died from the sky , it continued to wring his heart . He did not sleep that night . He did not dream.  |p205One  of the reasons why John Wesley Weasel grew so long and narrow was to keep him from getting stuck . Maybe the Creator expected that Weasel-brains would figure they could go anywhereand that Weasel-kidneys would know no caution , so that a Buggar like John Wesley , charging forward with a purblindcourage , might find himself in straits , as it were , and stuck . Half-way down a burrow , and so forth ; midway through two rocks . So , what the Creator did : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his body ; he shortenedthe legs and lengthened the tail , and he loosed this oddment to Weasel-devices hoping , since no one else could restrain him , that his own head would . Well , if the head-bone did n't fit , he 'd be stopped right there at the beginning before matters got worse , right ? And if John Wesley could get his head through anything first , why then the rest of him would follow like hoopla ! and happiness , right ? To gauge him against his own fine qualities of daring , courage , pluck , and fearlessness , God gave John Wesley Weasel a fat head . And it worked reasonably well in the physical world . It failed in the spiritual . More times than a Weasel liked to remember he 'd gotten himself stuck in tight situations , and sometimes he could brazenhis way out , but sometimes he was plain stuck and discomfited . Once his head did not prohibit him from loving a Mouse . A fool thing to do , to love a woman of any stripe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moony , lounging at her door ,  |p206|puffing  his chest , suffering the irritations of her seven children , suffering them in silence , mind you , " sparking , " as he called it . " Sparking the Widow . " This was the situation , a pleasant one , he admitted at first , and worth the bother , because the Widow had a touch of ferrety spunk herself . Oh , yes ! She 'd brought her children a monstrous piece from the mountainregions downriver to Chauntecleer 's Coop , and that by herself , and a Weasel could admire Weasel-notions , even in a Mouse , and in a woman . So John Wesley slipped into a situationpleasant  --  at first . Then came the sticking . The Wee Widow Mouse was murderedby a sliding Basilisk , and John was the first to find her dead , and all at once he was stuck , squeezed in his grief . Nobody told John about grief ! No , he could n't scream the aching out of him . It stays . No , he could n't fight nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he scorched the battlefield that day , and though he killed a countless host , himself inspiring the Animals unto victory , he lay down that night still aching . Nor was it the loss of his ear that caused this aching . It was the Wee Widow Mouse . Dead . And the aching did n't pass . See ? No way out of that situation , except maybe time . Time , busyness , action , no thinkings since thinks buggars the brains , noise . But even in these latter days John Wesley will notice one of the Brothers Mice in a certain pose , Freitag laughing , Samstag crying , and suddenly he 'll feel the pressure of his grief for the Widow : stuck . Still stuck , even though God gave him this fat head ... . And now , in the northern regions of the world , it had happenedagain , and the world was in a bad way . Old and gloomy memories were troubling him , and he moved with a slow step among the pine , frowning . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brains ; yet here he was , thinking . He tried a few short punches to cleanse himself , rising onp207his haunches : " Do and do for you  --  " It did n't work . Do what and for who ? Despite his head , John Wesley had sort of got himself stuck again , this time in a totally unexpected pinch , but one of his own making nonetheless : he had discovered lonesomeness . Worse , he felt it , and this gave him pause . It made him think , as it were . Because this was no mere want for company ; John Wesley had felt a cold and total solitude , and in that moment he believed in endings . Endings : only so many Critters in this universe , and few at that . Endings : one by one the Critters die . Endings : but could be all could die together , and then there would be a universe , turning , turning silently  --  but no Critters .... " Hoopla ! " shouted John Wesley in a pine forest , as loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoopla ! Hoopla ! Hoop  --  " Well , what had happened was , John Wesley had sort of come to an end , bumped into one . Not only , in his vigor , had he cleared the territories of their populations , leaving himself to scramble alone while others went south for dinner ; not only was he truly tired from the labors , and maybe that made even a Weasel vulnerable to contemplations and philosophies ( seeing how seldom a Weaselis weary unto idleness ) ; but also , John Wesley had traveled , finally , to the northernmost regions of the continent . He had walked out onto the utter wastes of the tundra , when all the stars were a shower in black heaven , and all the white around him cold and ghostly . He had seen his own paw , dark upon the ancient glacier . He had heard and felt the polar wind . And nothing , nothing in this vast , impassive realm either cared or knew that a Weasel was there . It dawned on John Wesley like thought : nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself . He had come to an end . He stood in it . Ice below , ice-pieces suspended for stars above , and only the emptiness between . John Wesley shriveled ; he had another thought : that his own little life could wink out and then thep208world would be deserted , left to the wind and the stone and the ice alone " Hey ! Ho ! Try me , yo ! Weasels sucker Buggars  --  oh ! Gives to butts a hundred cuts , and says , Please pass the sugar , Oh ! ' " Thus he recited now in the pine forest , stomping his hind paws , beating his fore-ones together , raising up his fat head . " Hey ! Ho ! Bite me , yo ! Weasels whirling fast and slow , Whips you raw jaw , paw and claw , then sits to see how fast you go  --  " No good . Taunt songs , bawdy songs , and he was stuck . He sat down . Well , John had escaped the tundra as soon as he felt its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green , south to the forests and some thin light again . But even so , he ran slower than usual , and memories began to bear him down , and the death of the Widow , which he had n't openly considered for so long , saddened him ; and it was strange , but the old ache was in him again , almost as though grieving and the northern cold were one and the same . He thought he saw what the Widow might have seen in the instant before she died , and he thought , " Oh , Widow . How lonely ! " And he thought , " Whycomesomeones could n't be with you then ? " " Ho-kay ! " roared John Wesley Weasel in the middle of a pine forest . He leaped up and raced on short legs in a hard , tight circle . " Do and do and do for you , John Double-u ! " And he bellowed at the top of his lungs : " Thinkings buggars the brains ! " He stopped and thrust his paw high in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home . Now ! " He sat down , frowning . Stuck . Who knows how long a Weasel , on first descending into melancholy , stays there ? No one . Not even John . One thing for sure : he would n't blame his Rooster any more for gloominesses , since he found out what powerful things they were , even to overcome a Double-u . John Wesley thought thatp209thought most solemnly  --  but then it became the last thought of his gloom , and suddenly he was delivered . He heard a living voice : " Do and do for you , Double-do ! " His hair stood up . A piece of rust went flying over his head . John Wesley sprang for the hollows beneath the pine and crouched , threequartershidden . But there was no one in the forest . Dead logs , ice-locked ; rocks out-cropping . No one . He stretched his neckSuddenly behind him the voice announced its position , yelling , " Hoople-la ! " He snapped round but saw nothing . Then closer , from the tree at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hoople-la ! Hoople-la ! " John twisted into knots . By Gaw , the devil was quick ! Three cries from three places and never a dash between ! John 's heart had begun to pump : a little fear , a little admiration , a great , huge rush of excitement : WAR ! Well , and if this was war , then let the warrior emerge . What kind of a bloody warrior hides ? Not John Double-u , whether he knows the foe or not ! By Gaw ! His head low down , his lip curled back from a row of needleteeth , John Wesley Weasel stepped to open ground . Flashing his eye all around himself , he drew his legs together , humping and hardening his spine , tightening like a bowstring . His claw closed on the earth ; he found a footing . At the bare glimpse of a throat this Weasel could spring and slash it . He was a deadly weapon , and he knew it . Slow , slow he delivered the challenge in a hiss . " Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But " Show ! " sang the voice from the left-hand tree . Then , as quick as sin , it shifted and sang from the right : " Damn self . Hee-hee ! " Hee-hee ?  |p210What  it was : there were two , three enemies , and John was surrounded , and it was their territory , not his , and they knew the terrain , he did n't , so every advantage was theirs  --  hot damn ! John liked them odds ! Black thunder was his face ! He was feeling better . " This Double-u , " he hissed , " he fights like a fighter . Teeth to tooth , in the opens . Come out , Someones ! Kill or bloody be killed by John  --  " " Hee-hee . " Hee-hee , for God 's sake ! Who giggles at battles ? At threats ? At John ? John threw himself into his viciousness . He extended his long body and roared , " See me ? See John ? John 's built to go in hidy places , Buggar ! Fang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to crawl toward the left-hand tree : target " Hee-hee ! " Oh , those giggles were intolerable ! Oh , this Weasel trembled , the bolt so close to shooting : " No protections , no ! You do n't comes to John ? So ! John , he comes to you ! " John coiledBut in the instant before his launch he heard the wail , " NO ! NOT THEM ! " A new Critter come ! " ME ! ME ! KILL ME ! " John spun on his tail and saw a full-grown Coyote limping toward him from the east , unguarded , unable , desperately abject : by her hindlegs alone she was pushing herself ahead , her cheek and chest both on the ground . What ? Cripples came to fight him ? He turned toward his target again , and found his anger somewhat off the rhythm . He hesitated . " Please , " the woman whined . " They could outrun you . And even if you eat them , they 're a mouthful apiece . I 'm dinner for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " Hee-hee ! " That giggle again ! " Hee-hee " and " Hee-hee " from points north , west and south of the Weasel . John was growing bewildered by this sort of aggression . Might-be a truce and some talking together  --   |p211All  at once the gigglers appeared and began to charge at him , and John Wesley was thunderstruck : " Babies , " he murmured . Fluffy , rusty , delighted with the scene that they had caused : John was going to slaughter  --  baby Coyotes . Gaw ! " The closer they came , the more the woman panicked : " HERE ! FIGHT ME ! FIGHT ME ! " So she was the mama . But he was no fighter no more . He turned to her for help . He took a step and said , " Mama Coyote  --  " But then he had another shock : Straightway the woman leaped a full nine feet through the air , a strong , spectacular flight away from him , astonishing grace . Nevertheless , when she hit ground again , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John , his wits were gone . No : he was n't gloomy any more , just confused . And tired . And might-be he should be alone . " Mama Coyote , she does n't need to worry , no , " he said delicately . " John goes away now , ho-kay ? Goo-by . Goob  --  " But he had forgotten the baby-attack on its way . The brother of the bunch , utterly fearless , tumbled forward , knocked a Weasel , and stuck his nose into John Wesley 's mouth , crying , " Hello ? Hello ? " " Benoni , no ! " The woman rushed between them on healthy legs . " Right ! No ! " gagged the Weasel , spitting fur . " Why could n't you stay at the Den ? " She cuffed a sister . " Right ! At the Den ! " the Weasel approved the discipline . " I ca n't "  --  while she cuffed the other  --  " watch and forageboth ! " " Right ! " roared the Weasel . " Ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and do and do , " sang this little Benoni , happily plucking Weasel-whiskers , one at a time . " Ack ! Get ! " bellowed the Weasel , snatching back his whiskers . " John needs them things ! " And " Get ! " he howled at the sister who was sniffing his behind , the most indefensible part of his anatomy.  | " Get ! Get ! Get ! " he pleaded with the sister who was licking all his old scars with maternal compassion . " Mama Coyote , does n't you see to your childrens ?  --  " But Mama Coyote was no help at all . She 'd changed again . She was plain sitting on her haunches , her muzzle stretched up to heaven , her eyes shut tight and running tears  --  and she was laughing . Laughing . John , under full attack , was on his own . " Does n't , " he roared , " Mama Coyotes spank them bratlings ? " She shook her head . She could n't speak for laughing . " Does n't Mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then language burst from the woman . " Soldiers , " she gasped , " who stomp and sweat  --  in your own backyard  --  look  --  ridiculous ! " John Wesley Weasel , bloody warrior locked in battle with babies , suddenly saw himself stomping and sweating , glowering , threatening , glooming about such things as end-of-theworld , solemn about lonesomeness and death John Wesley Weasel suddenly saw himself ridiculous ! So he said , " Haw ! " loud as a horn , and that 's how he laughed . " Haw ! Haw ! " roared John Wesley , on account of his silliness . And " Haw ! " because , by Gaw , these here babies liked him , and he liked to be liked . For the space of a day , by the grace of God , the Weasel forgot hunger , the winter , the world and all . He had a vacation . " What 's a Double-do ? " asked Benoni . " Fearsomenesses , threats and storm-spits , " growled the Weasel , " what gobbles childrens . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Double-do knows about the Witch with No Stomach ? " " Ha ! " cried John Wesley . " Is my mama . " Benoni laughed . Private stories shared make friends . " Double-do ! You only got one ear ! " " John 's mama freezed one off for sassings. "  | " Double-do , do you got courage ? " " Courage is braveness . John gots braveness , you bet ! Beats little Buggars ' headses in . " Benoni presented his head to find out what beatings-in were like . " Rips out little Buggars ' gizzards ! " Twill searched her whole body for a gizzard which could be ripped out . " Bites tails to make some garter-straps ! " Immediately , three tails were in his mouth . " Ack ! " Oh , what a pleasure on a very cold day . And Mama watched , grinning . And Mama it was who invited a tired warrior to rest in their Den at the end of it . And a warrior was glad again . So easily John Wesley 's head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic was the Den itself , like a little hut against the weather . Where babies are , where women sit , the fighter ca n't be brutal any more . John lay relaxed while Benoni Coyote gazed at him with unabashed interest . " So , " said the Weasel . Benoni nodded solemnly . " So " was a fine thing to say and to hear . " So . Might-be , " the Weasel began , " little . A manly conversation . " Is mighty , is a warrior . Fights fights of goodness and no-blenesses . " " My papa is mighty , " Benoni declared . " Benoni gots a papa ? " John Wesley scrutinized the pup . He thought backward a moment . " Is skinny ? " he asked . Benoni nodded . " Sometimes stiff as wood ? A wooden Critter ? " Benoni nodded . " Ah , well , John , he thinks he met Benoni 's papa once . " " Then you 're lucky , are n't you , Double-do ? " said Benoni.  | " ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he could beat the Witch with No Stomach . Mighty . " " Okay , " John thought it wise to say . " A mighty Coyote . " There was a nice silence in the Den . Rachel combed her daughters ' coats with a motherly claw . Benoni sat fixed , staring at the Weasel . " Double-do ? " he whispered . He had a new question in his head . " What , little Benoni Coyote ? " A very important question  --  for the pup squirmed round until he 'd put his nose to the Weasel 's nose , and he took John Wesley 's face between his paws . Very earnestly he said , " You 're my friend now , right ? " " Ack ! " said John . He began to clear his throat . That was his answer . " And do you love somebody with a very big , big love ? " The Weasel thought of a Rooster , his melancholy Lord . But he said , " Do n't squash John 's face , okay ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had another matter on his mind , so deep and serious that it made his eyes seem old indeed . " Please , " he said , " when you go , if you meet my papa again  --  please tell him to hurry home . Tell him Benoni loves him with a very big , big love . Double-do , tell him that Benoni misses him . " Thirty-oneDreaming StillLord Chauntecleer set a remorseless pace for the journey north . He himself took a grim position in Black-Pale 's antlers , riding the high bounds without a word . As fast as the Stag could travel , so fast did Chauntecleer wish to go.  |p215One  thing alone was left for him to do , and how he was constrained till it was done ! Animals traveled in his train , like the tail of a comet : other Deer , Goats , the hasty Hare and Pronghorn , Sheep , Cats on their own recognizance , Wolves in the wings . The fire in him had burned them , too . But inspiration is n't capability , and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cobb got as far as Chalcedony 's valley of Cicadas , where he collapsedpanting . He dragged himself to the side while hooves and paws pounded past , and he thought , " Well , I ca n't go back again . What would Mrs. Cobb think of me if I did ? " He thought , " I 'll wait here . I 'll wait till they return  --  " The hardier Animals kept pace . A band of Creatures wound through the woods ; broke open to the frozen grasslands ; bowed their heads before a bitter wind ; fell silent , save for the rhythm of their running , under a low , forbidding sky ; slept dead and close to one another in the night , but rose in the dim morning , rose to their aching legs , rose again and followed the blazing Rooster  --  and ran . It was because they chose to follow that he led  --  not because he chose to lead them . Their hearts were on him ; but his was on the thing ahead . Chauntecleer : he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his baptism . They merely ran . But they believed on him . So they ran . Animals galloped behind him . There was only one who went before . Yet this one had the Rooster 's attention , because he had a map in his head , and he was the key . A Coyote , utterly terrified by the trek and its intensity . Sometimes the strange Coyote would fall down . He would twist around and bite his own shin , and this was no soft bite . He 'd break flesh and draw blood . Then Chauntecleer would talk and talk to him in a low voice , and the Coyote would get up again to a nervous trot . But his tail was ever between his legs . One noon the Beast doubled over and vomited all the food he 'd eaten at the Hemlock . It lay steaming on the ground , andp216the Coyote seemed to regard it with immeasurable sadness . Then Chauntecleer , since talking availed nothing , touched the point of the Slasher to his buttock , mounted the Coyote himself and rode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After that the Coyote withdrew into a daze and took them straight to their destination without another lapse . Chauntecleer wore his weapons . Again and again , unconsciously , he felt the heft of Gaff and the Slasher , bound tightly at his spurs . He was feeling his readiness . He was feeling the skill in him and the fight to come , the strength of his cause and its certainty . Nothing prevented him any more but the getting there . He breathed through his nostrils . His beak was a nail in this outrageous winter ; his eye was lidded and hard . He took the black Stag 's bucking leaps without a word . But his heart was screaming , I am going to kill you , Wynn ! Ferric , that skinny Coyote  --  Ferric simply could n't comprehendthe thing that he was doing . All he could think was that the consequences would be terrible . He had gone to get food , and he was bringing back instead a host of thundering beasts . Run he never so fast , they were always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all their teeth on the little Den that held his wife and children , who had n't a hint of what was coming . Rachel ! He thought of Rachel 's smile and Rachel 's confidence in him . Benoni , too . Benoni , wondering why his papa was so weak , so craven , and so scared . For Benoni he would be mighty . For Rachel he wanted to be a calm provider . But what was he doing ? Why , he , Ferric , he was bringing the doom upon their heads . He . He ! None other . So when Rachel appeared in the air before him , whispering , This is the truth : mighty among all of the Creatures ; when that woman smiled , Ferric fell down in an agony of self-loathing , and he took his own leg between his teeth , and he bit it to the bone . Who else was there to punish ? No one . Himself.  |p217But  the Rooster would murmur with fire in his eye , " Jug , jug , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the driving Rooster and himself . " Bring me to her who cries jug , jug , and I will set you free , " the Rooster would promise , and Ferric would feel the lure of that freedom . " Till then the world depends on you . The peace of the universe rests with you . Go . Go . Go  --  " Once , astounded by his own bravado , the Coyote had lied . He took the whole procession in the wrong direction , for three full hours making a slow turn to the right , enough to angle them away from his pitiful family . He planned to take them nowhere , and then they could kill him if they wished . But suddenly there came a dreadful whistle from the sky , the shriek of accusation , and down from the heavens dropped a Hawk , stooping at a wild speed . He landed . He revealed their divergence from true north . And Ferric Coyote threw up . He vomited every precious bit of food reserved for his family . Neither could he swallow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sadness , because now he had nothing for the childrenthat he loved , and the very reason for his going was gone . After that he lost himself as well . Motion became automatic merely . A sting in his buttock made him move . The Rooster clutching at his shoulders judged him . And instinct took him home . He did n't want to think . Chauntecleer is dreaming . Curiously , he 's glad that the dream has returned , proof of the expedition . With all his heart , with all his soul and might , he is crying aloud , " I am coming ! " But there is a difference in this dream , and it rather distresses him , since everything should remain the same and nothing change to trouble his purposes . He can see . Far , far away , walking on some celestial sphere as though she isp218walking in the valleys of the moon , Chauntecleer sees the Dun Cow , one horn at her head , one horn gone . Oh , she is so distant ! He could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call  --  Are you the woman of sorrows after all ? But he does n't call anything like that , because he ca n't see her face ; because she is walking yet farther away from him , as though refusing to acknowledge him , and he is hurt by the coldness of the gesture ; and because in this dream , in this sublunar sphere , he 's calling something else . " I am coming ! " roar his throat and mouth . " I am coming ! " Almost he cries to the Dun Cow his perfect explanation : It is my destiny , my worth , my goodness ; I ca n't do otherwiseBut suddenly the dream is strangled by a single word from Wynn , arising like the fog : Come . And Chauntecleer wakes . Thirty-twoThe Canyon Lough DergJohn Wesley 's eyes popped open , awake , alert to a sound . Clop . The woman Coyote woke second , raised her head . The pups snored . John Wesley stood up . " Wait , " said the woman . Coyotes do freeze ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So : an uncertain hoof at the rim of the canyon , someone finding footing . Then there were a number of hooves clatter/ing , and several someones descending the steep fall of stone . So . A figure passed . The woman drew breath sharply : " Ferric ! " Wooden Coyote , thought John Wesley . He 'd glimpsed a thin Beast grinning meaninglessly , skulking downstream with his tail between his legs . Is Ferric ? Poor Ferric . Poor little BenoniImmediately the legs of an enormous Stag crossed the Weasel'svision , and other legs in forest . These , too , were familiar . John stuck his head outside  --  and was struck dumb , a Weasel speechless , so shocked by the sight that he truly could not catch his breath . It was his Rooster ! It was his Rooster , riding that elegant Stag in the exact same canyon where John was , but how could this be ? It was his Rooster ! Look at his Rooster . By Gaw , look at him ! Why , he was glorious now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a Lord should be . His comb stood up like a castle wall  --  oh , look at that mighty comb ! And his beak , it gleamed like jet . And his nails flashed whiter than the lily . And he had weapons on ! It was his Rooster , by Gaw , the same Lord Somebody-Chauntecleer that he remembered from the first bright days of vigor , conviction , and we-can-do-anythings , anythings : that Rooster ! Him ! Come back again ! Rooster ! Rooster ! Poor John could n't get his mouth to work . Rooster ! He could n't declare the marvel that they should bump into one another in a northern canyon . And the black Stag was galloping downstreamFor one horrible instant the Weasel feared that this wonder was all a dream . It was too perfect . But then imperfection happily kicked him in the butt , and he knew it was reality : the Deer behind Black-Pale struck and nearly crushed John Wesley , the Goats , the Sheep , the swirling hooves of Beasts . He fumbled back into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality : he did n't hold this beating against a single soul . No , he came up grinning , forgiving them all . " Mama Coyote , " he coughed , he laughed , he gestured out/side and downstream . " Is my Rooster , my Rooster come back again ! " Neither could Rachel speak . She stood pressed against the back wall , all of her children beneath her , a staring terror in her eye . Benoni said , " Mama ? " The plain brown Bird leaped frantically , branch to branch in her thornbush . Her body switched and fluttered ; her claws snatched and released three twigs in a second ; but her head held steady , because she was watching an impossible arrival . Down the gorge , splashing and stamping behind a crouching Coyote  --  a herd ! Toward her directly and without a pause , as though she were the destination , but how could that be ?  --  a herd of Beasts , strangers . And in the front walked a coal-black Deer , and in his antlers trembled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hold still . She thrashed around the bush as though flying on a tether , though she could n't fly ; in fact , she was piercing her flesh by the broken points of wingbone , and bleeding . This was such an enormity , suddenly to be watched by so many eyes . The Beasts halted some space from her . What ? What ? She watched them back . The fire on the Deer spread its wings and sailed down to the ground in an easy circle . It was a Rooster . It was a Rooster of vast dignity and strength and a penetrating eye . He moved toward her , he alone . His eye fixed her like a charm , and she stilled . He yearned to know something . What ? He came unhurried . She was his total attention . Oh , he draped her altogether with his looking , and it was not cruel . It was  --  it wanted to be  --  familiar : do I know you ? He tilted his head to the side in a motion of perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . Do I know you ? The Rooster paused at the bush , his warm eye level with her own . " Woman , " he said aloud . " Are you sad ? "  |p221What  a question ! Sad ? Self-consciousness burned her from the throat to the breast , and she fluttered , and sadness did in fact overwhelm her  --  a sadness that rose from this moment and the loneliness of such an audience : embarrassment . A sadness that reached backward through her isolated life in this place , to the memory of the obscenity that kept her here , guarding a hole , the stain that stained her . Sad ? What right had a stranger to such a question ? Do I know you ? She never intended to be sad in public . Sad ! She cried out at the Rooster . She cried , " Jug ! " " What ? " he said . " Jug ! " she cried , hopping in the bush again , angry that he could so quickly draw her out , he and his sympathetic eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had no tongue . Therefore , " Jug " is the only sound she made : " Jug , jug ! Jug , jug ! Jug , jug ! " Instantly the Rooster was transfigured , and the brown Bird silenced . He swelled like a thunderhead in heaven , startled with lightning , and he began to rumble . No ! I do n't know you ! He was magnificent . He was frightening . " Coyote , you are free ! " he crowed . " Go ! " But the tone of that crow only drove the Coyote into a heap against the farther wall and ice . " Woman , " he crowed to the Bird . " There is no need for your loneliness . Look : I 've brought you brothers and sisters and cousins and friends ! " He meant it . The Bird perceived that he truly meant to abolish her loneliness  --  but the gesture was too grand , and she was only diminished . " You ! " crowed the Rooster to the herd that stood wall to wall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  farewell ! You are a holy nation , truly . Believe that . And we have suffered our troubles together , and you have been so dear to me , so dear that I can not say it . But I go , now , to redeem those troubles forever . You will do well . You will do so well without me  --  "  |p222Some  of the Sheep looked stunned by those words , and their soft faces melted in sorrow . " I ask only two favors in remembrance . When the winter is over and the times are sweet and green again , please give a thought to me , and know that I caused that for you . I will be in the grass ; my own breath will be the spring breezes . And this : tell Pertelote that I love her . Farewell ! " crowed the Rooster a ringing crow . And then , more softly : " Farewell . " This glorious Rooster turned , then , and walked in water to the side of the bush and behind it . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hole that sank so deep into the earth . And the brown Bird realized what he was about to do . He was going down there . No , she wailed . I 'm sorry I yelled at you ! No ! she wailed . But what she said was , " Jug ! " He took a step toward the darkness . She leaped from the bush to his backOh , you do n't know the Evil that waits for you down there ! But what , in wild frustration , she said was , " Jug ! Jug ! " He shrugged her off . She sprang to his back again , and this time she drove her beak against his skull , puncturing flesh . He did n't fight or hurt her . Neither did he stop . He bowed and plucked her from his feathers with an iron claw and laid her on the ground , and was gone , swallowed by the earth . With all her heart the woman calls to him , in dread for him , and desolated because he will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is one who knows the Evil . Woman , she thinks she hears his distant voice : What else do you want me to do for you ? Come back ! she wails . But she is hopeless . For all she can cry is , " Tereu ! "  |p223Light-headed  and frightened at once , Lord Chauntecleer felt his way along the pitch-black , twisting corridor . He followed a falling water . He did not stumble , since all of his senses were tuned and acute . He was ready , now . And he went without a doubt : this was his dream awoken . This was the real . Wyrm was below . " God , give me the strength ! " He held one secret in his heart which released him unto this endeavor and lent him a limitless power : that he was willing to die . Nay , death itself would be his victory ! Then what could Wyrm do to him ? Evil had lost its threat , and he was free . " I am coming to kill you , Wyrm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths , then , where the walls had widened into a massive yawn , and the roof was vaulted monstrously high , and the air was fetid ; down in a cathedral of silence , where his claw had found the stone substratum , Chauntecleer the Rooster had come . Gaff struck stone and made a spark , red and dying . Night in this place was perpetual . Wyrm 's lair . It stank of Wyrm . One violent shiver passed over the Rooster , the last in his life , for this one was anticipation of his final offering . Then that was all . He prepared . He raked the darkness with sightless eyes . He drooped his wings . He arched his back . he sucked the loathesome air into his lungs ; and he , with all his being , all hisp224long collected hatreds , his vengeance , his vengeance , crowed : " WYRM ! " He echoed the earth-tunnels with that challenge and shocked the ancient silences . It was a living voice he issued : " WYRM ! " Ah , said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with readiness . A light appeared above him . He whirled and stared at it . It was thin as thread , and green . Soon another hung beside it , and another , and each was writhingas though it were alive , but none was longer than an inch or two , and all of them glimmered mid-distance in the darkness . The glowing spread . Chauntecleer watched it spread like a rash , slowly ; but he would be as patient as eternity . Yet his body screamed with the thing to come . Sing , said the air . The light itself dimmed and said , What shall we sing ? Of death , said the air like pressure around him . Death already dead . " Wyrm ! " cried Chauntecleer . " Show yourself ! " A million million tendril lights lit up , and all the little lights were taking shape . They formed a titanic head with a mouth as wide as a chancel , locked open on a huge , sardonic laugh . " Wyrm  --  " Behind that head there lay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planet that runs a thousand miles through mantlerock . And all of the light was pulsing . " Wyrm . " Chauntecleer thrust his wings wide to either side of him . He set his mind , now , and he rushed for speed , and he took to the air . He soared upward in the chamber , higher and higher until he curved near the ceiling , five times higher than that head , and the carcass lay below him like a river . Chauntecleer sailed to a precise zenith . This was it . " Now ! " he shrieked . " My life ! My vindication ! " And he dropped.  |p225Like  the Falcon , with his wings laid back , his claws against his chest and Gaff and the Slasher turned to a lethal strike , Chauntecleer shot his body , his body the bullet , down to Wyrm . He would drive through the skull ! He would pierce the skull and die in the monster 's brain ! " Wyyyyyr  --  " But he did n't . It was a marsh of rot that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat . Chauntecleer took the concussion , spun an instant , then leaped up on Wyrm and fought . He stabbed and riddled the skin ; he scored it with brilliant speed , deep , deep , digging to bone before the monster returned attack , like diggingin mushroom  --  but none of it mattered . The corpse did n't move . It did n't bleed . It did n't cry out . It did n't react . It did n't fight back , though Chauntecleer assaultedwith a devestating skill . It lay inert . It was dead . Wyrm was already dead ! And suddenly Chauntecleer stood still on his skull  --  alive . And what was the light that surrounded him , green and glimmering , as passive as the grass ? Why , worms . Little worms ! An infinity of threadlike worms , eating the flesh of the enemy  --  how long ? " What are you ? " shrieked Chauntecleer , stamping his claw . He touched bone . He had burrowed to bone . " Where are you ? Where are you that I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in futility . " Wyrm ? Wyrm ? WYRM ? IS THIS YOU ? " Chauntecleer , panting , slumped to the edge of this continentalcorpse and looked over to the ground , but there was no answer anywhere . The earth and all its passages were still . " Oh , God , " he murmured . He fell . He slithered down Wyrm 's cheek and cracked himself on stone . " Oh , God , do n't take this away from me . Not this . " John Wesley 's eyes were shining . Each new word increased his excitement.  | " Who ? " he said . " Wyrm , " said a Goat . " Naw ! " said John Wesley Weasel . He beat his paws together . " Naw ! Naw ! " He could hardly believe his good fortune . " Where ? " he said . " There , " said String Jack , staring at the hole behind the bush where the stream was swallowed . Indeed , all the Animals watched that hole . " Naw ! " cried John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Rooster , he went down there ? " The Hare nodded . John grinned . " For fightings with Wyrm ? Wyrm ? " The poor Hare nodded . " Naw ! " John fairly exploded , grinning till his cheeks split . But there arose from that hole such a shrill , sustained , and distant battle-crow , that the Weasel fell on his back and roared with laughter . Nothings , nothings , nothings in all the world could ever match this act for glory . And his Rooster had conceivedit , and his Rooster had gone and done done it ! Hoopla ! Who else but his Rooster ? Nobody else , by-cause no one was like his Rooster . " And whats , " he cried , " what does Buggars do now ? " Hegrinned like the sun on all of them . **28;13807;TOOLONG answered , " We wait . " " What ? " " We wait . Lord Chauntecleer chose to go alone . We wait for a Dog to come up  --  " " Dog ? " said John . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cani Dog ? " " Get back , " said Black-Pale with strange quietness . " We wait . " John Wesley looked at him , at all the Beasts , and saw that none of them knew his joy . " What-a-hell ? " he thought to himself . " Somethings is wrong ? " But " Wait , " he said . He could do that.  |p227His  eye lighted on the Coyote crouched in an icy corner , and happiness leaped in his heart . " Hey ! " he cried . " Hey , wooden Coyote ! John , he gots a message for you . " The wretched Creature did n't so much as lift an eye . So John went straight to him and gave him a happy cuff . " Hey . Wooden Coyote , he 's papa to a little Buggar , right ? " No answer . No response . " Well , lookee : John chatted with that little Buggar ; and that pup , he says , You see my papa , ' says he , you tell my papa  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell my papa , Hurry home . ' Little Benoni Coyote , " said John , " he loves his papa . " The Coyote heard . The thin Coyote began , without a motion , to cry . Well , that was more than a Weasel could stand . " What-a-hell ! " he roared , turning to all of these taciturn Beasts . " Why-come Critters is so sad , so gloomy right now ? " It was Black-Pale who answered , quietly , " Lord Chauntecleeris n't coming back . " " What ? " said John , eyeing the Stag . " He went down below the earth to die . " " What ? What ? " John Wesley rose on his hind legs , a dull cold gripping his chest . " The Rooster , he what ! " Black-Pale whispered it like a litany : " He 's gone to die . " Again and again and again , desultory , Chauntecleer struck Gaff against the stone , making a dead-metal sound , while the massive mouth above him laughed no sound at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basin in the floor . Perhaps to catch some liquid in . Tears . Blood . Shame . Like hot wax he allowed the knowledge of his shame to run through him , and still he had no words for it . Wyrm was dead . What was there left for him to do ? He 'd sold his whole life for this moment . He 'd bought sweet death and an oblivion . But Wyrm had beaten him to it . So what was left for him to do ? He had promised the Animals " Oh , Wyrm ! "  |p228-he  'd sworn an oath before his Animals : how grand he had been then ! He had committed his worth and all his purpose to this single task , and he had declared it absolutely in the presence of Pertelote . This is Chauntecleer . This is Chauntecleer . This is the Savior , finally , of the whole world , 0 glorious Cock . But Wyrm was dead already . And the wretched Cock alive . So what , with his miserable life , was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oh  --  " Look . Look ! There 's Pertelote ! Or the shadow of her  --  O my wife . Standing in darkness , shaking her head with a cold , condemning reproach : I asked only that you would not do this thing in madnessChauntecleer started and wailed , " Pertelote ! " Chauntecleer bellowed mightily , " Oh , hideous  --  ! Oh , fire and fury  --  ! Oh , Wyrm ! " He leaped to his feet , trembling . Little worms dropped from him . Little worms had been crawling underneath his feathers . He did n't notice . He turned . He confronted the monumental corpse in its mansion , and he shrieked , " Can I pretend that I killed you ? No ! " Chauntecleer doubled with the violence of his words . " I ca n't even pretend I did the deed ! Because look at me . I 'm still alive ! There was no sacrifice ! Will nobody , " he cried , and he whirled high into the air , blasted by the winds of his humiliation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come and kill me here ? " It looked like madness . But it was a Rooster totally mortified . He flew . He circled thrice in the vault , beating his wings mercilessly , going nowhere . Then , suddenly , Chauntecleer flew with a lancing skill straight for the swelling that once had been Wyrm 's eye . He hit it . He attached himself to it . By rapid slashings he tore the flesh and raked it with his claws and shredded it as though it were a curtain  --  till the membrane gave way , and he tumbled inward , landing in the alcove of Wyrm 's skull where the eyeballhad rolled so long ago  --   | " Oh , no ! " There before him lay the last , most painful grief of all . Even his passion turned against him and accused . For here , as though awaiting him , lay the bones of the Dog , Mundo Cani . Bones . Only the bones . Great shin-bones of a fleeting speed , stilled . Ribs that had contained a mortal heart . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings together , like a child , whining , staring , disbelieving . " Mundo Cani , Mundo Cani , Mundo Cani , " he whined high in his throat , a child , " could n't you wait for me ? Did n't you know how much I loved you ? How can I tell you that I loved you , now ? Mundo Cani , Mundo Cani  --  " Dead , said the air . He died within three days , said the air . Did n't you know that ? Chauntecleer bowed his head . Deep spasms passed through his body as though he would vomit . But he was changing , like the chrysalis . He raised his head again ; and in that alcove crawling with worms , he began to pick the individual strings , the worms , from his beloved , one by one . Slowly he cleansed the skeleton , delicately laying each green tendril by . In the light his eye and his manner seemed all at once serene . " I am going to die beside you , dear , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air sighed . The air spoke . Who knew whether Chauntecleer heard it ? " For no good , " said Chauntecleer , now cradling Mundo Cani 's skull . " For no good at all , but because I love you , I will stay here till I die  --  " No , you wo n't , sighed the air. "  --  and because there is nothing left for me . It is as though I am dead already . " He rocked the Dog . He lifted up his head , his eyes closed . He was mother to these bones . " You and I andp230no one else . Alone , alone in our grave , forever . And I will sing for you  --  " Ah , Galle , you are still the fool , heaved the air of the alcove , the air of the caves , the air in a dry sighing . I am dead indeed . But I am not consumed . What do you know of death ? The Dog knows more than you do , and I learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better part of him resolved into the air . Gasses , more than gasses : he floated out of himself as spirit . Spirit , Galle , unconfined by flesh , the very penetration of will and free being . I saw , and I chose that way for myself . Galle , behold : I have died . I have gone out of myself as spirit . I am the Dark . What is the shape of darkness ? I am the Cold . Where are the limits of coldness ? And I may be the penetration into whomsoever does not deny me . Let the living but breathe me in , dear Galle , and I live ! No , you are not alone . I am here . I suffuse the subterranean regions , cold and dark , am everywhere below . Waiting . Who knew whether the Rooster heard the sighing of the air ? He bent in his round closet and kissed the Dog 's skull . He stroked it lovingly . He , too , was waiting . He caressed the eyesockets of Mundo Cani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all things . " Wyrm is dead . " Indeed , Wynn is dead , the air blew lightly , like a breeze . No body and no name attaches to me any more . I am Evil , the thing itself . Breathe , Galle , sighed the air . Only just breathe and receive me , and I shall abide in you , something of your soul . Oh , Galle , is n't this a wonder ? When you leave this place , then I go with you . You , Galle , you are my escape ! You , who set your face against me ! And in time , like a spirit into all the Keepers , the very soul of the community , I shall escape you as well . Spiritus Mundi ! sighed the wind in a clear , whispering gale , endless as eternity . It really did rush through the tunnels of the earth . It blew throughout the huge room where Chauntecleersat round his bones , protecting them . Then , Ecce ! whistled a mighty wind through the throats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darken the face of God , and all creation shall grow cold ! Ecce , ego facio nova ! Only just breathe me , Cock.  |p231But  Chauntecleer covered a skull against the wind and whisperedhis sorrow and his consolation together . He said , " Sweet Mundo Cani , I love you  --  and Wyrm is dead . " A Ceremony of InnocenceJohn Wesley Weasel had instincts for the darkness and speed underground . When the black water flowed straight and downward , he swam the water . Where it boiled , he slithered rock . And down . And down , breakneck . What harried him was the wind . The farther down he went below the earth , the louder grew a whistling , premonitory wind , and the air in this tunnel was a sucking thing . It was a greater motion than he understood , like breathing . But down , because his Rooster should n't die . What did the Rooster think ? Did Rooster think that nobodies would stand by him ? Rooster , gone in his lonesomeness . Gone to do things alone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and planning already to die ! Is no fight , a dying fight : is hopeless ! So what 's a-matter with Rooster , gone to die ? John flung himself through the blackness . And downWhen the tunnel suddenly opened , John Wesley bolted out onto a wide escarpment and tumbled . He rolled down stone until he hit an absolute floor with his left shoulder . The jolt shuddered his joints , and he was dizzy a moment . He 'd fallen into a measureless cavern . The wind fairlyp232roared in this place  --  like a living thing , the haunting of the Netherworld . John had no second thoughts about this wind : he feared it . He despised it . He was an Animal who knew the malice of yellow tornadoes and sudden squalls in the afternoon . They were unnatural . But this was unnatural on purpose , alien altogether . " Rooster ! " he cried . Far ahead of him was a sort of glowing , a livid shadow of astounding size . He blinked to see it , but it was vague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He ran , and his poor heart kicked inside of him , because the shadow took shape  --  as huge as the razorbacks low in the mountains , and still , and longer than sight could follow ; softly green ; a head like a mesa , the mouth wide open , and maybe this blasting wind rushed from that mouth . Wyrm . John Wesley Weasel paused in awe . Wyrm , you are so big ! And so wicked . The very stillness of the monster , in so violent a wind , was treachery . John flat hated what he saw . But what he saw : like an endless bluff , it was not moving . It seemed a mere thrust of landscape , a long green cliff that overhung him , impassive , calm and  --  dead . Dead ! John Wesley choked on the wonder . " Rooster ! " he cried . " Oh , Rooster , what you done done ! " Dead . John wanted to laugh with his whole heart at the miracle . This was impossible . Who kills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on hind legs , leaning against the wind , and he pierced the roaring with his own triumphant cry : " R00000000ster ! " Then all at once it seemed that the monster turned its eye , and John shrank from that horror . Too soon glad  --  do n't never be too soon glad . The horror went deep . John Wesley would not shake it until he 'd left this place for good . Nor did it matter that there was no eye at all in the head of Wyrm , that it was a darker figure moving to look outward from the socket . The dread was in John now.  |p233The  figure peered a moment into space , then withdrew into the cavity and sat . It was Chauntecleer . Chauntecleer composed himself and sat . Like being home . What . What . He likes it here ? What ? " Rooster ! Ha-ha ! " cried John Wesley , truly delighted . " What you done ! Oh , so brave , the thing you done  --  " Again , the Cock inclined his head  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Time , now , for Critters to go , " he called , truly fearful . " Come , Rooster ! Buggars be so happy to hear the things all done . Come . We go ! " Chauntecleer said something . John Wesley could not hear him for the wind . " What ? " he cried . The Cock bent back his head and crowed . It was little in therushing wind , but John heard it and was thunderstruck . " Save yourself , John , " crowed the Rooster . " Go away . " " What ? Rooster says what ? " " Go away ! Go away ! " the Rooster crowed in Wyrm 's skull , blackness in his eye . " Leave me alone ! " John Wesley was bewildered . And angry , suddenly . " Why ? " he cried . Like a lamentation , the Rooster crowed , " I 've found the bones of Mundo Cani . Here are the bones of Mundo Cani . I 'll stay with the bones of Mundo Cani . Go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones ? So bones is buried . But soon some wickednesses here makes bones of us . Come and we go ! " " No ! " " Why ? " " Because I am going to die here . " Oh , John hated the ceaseless blowing of the wind . The Rooster said it ! Said what they said he said . Said he 's going to die here . No ! Rooster , he 's not going to die here . And it never was a question , even , whether John should leave withouthim . By-cause , he loved his Rooster . " No need ! " John announced . " No need for dyings.  |p234Rooster  , he can strut and be proud . Lookee , " cried John Wesley . " Wyrm is dead  --  " Then came a crow of shattering agony : " I did not kill him . He was dead . God took the glory from me . It is gone . It is gone . " The wind lulled , as if a climax had been passed , and the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . By-cause , he loved his Rooster . " Rooster , " whispered John . " Oh , Rooster . He does n't needs to be Lord-and-General-of-all , no . Not for John , no . Only just to come home again , and might-be rules a little bit . Please just rule a little bit . " But Chauntecleer had bent his head . He was singing . In the silence the Weasel heard him singing softly to something in front of him . Bones . " Rooster ? " Songs that rhymed with Mundo Cani , odd lullabies in this dank and cruel vault . " Rooster ? Does n't you talk with John no more ? Rooster ? Which somebody gots fur on him still ? Does bones , or does John Double-u ? " Quivering melodies sung in the nose , like an old , old woman . " Who loves you , Rooster ? " The songs resolved themselves into a plainsong chanting . No ending to them . But it never was a question whether John would leave this place without his Rooster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And John was a Weasel who could not not act for long . And this had been too long , by Gaw ! " Hoopla ! " he cried all suddenly . He took ten steps toward the darkness , turned , and charged the very jaw of Wyrm . " Hoopla ! " Up the cheek of the monster he scrambled , screamingp235Weaselish war-cries . He gained the socket-ledge and flung himself inside . Chauntecleer had just begun to turn a bland eye toward him , when the Weasel  --  " Hoopla ! "  --  threw him a body-check , grabbed the leg-bone of Mundo Cani , yanked it free , and hurled it into darkness . Tail-bones went flying next , like dice skimming the stone " Do n't ! " the Rooster shrieked . Shin-bones , ribs , a pelvis cavorted through the air . John cleaned house . " Wretch ! " screamed Chauntecleer . " What are you doing ? " He sprang himself into the darkness . He sank out of sight . But a rattling below was the hectic Rooster gathering bones again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wailed . The wind began to blow , swelling like laughter . Finally the Weasel seized the skull itself and the Dog 's crumbling nose . He pushed it over the edge and leaped after it . So , the Rooster loves his bones , does he ? So , let him chase his bones ! " Dog 's head ! Dog 's head ! " John Wesley sang , and he kicked it . " Here goes a Dog 's head ! " He struck and punted the skull like a ghastly ball . He drove it as fast as he could across the stone . And then he hooked a paw through an eyehole and dragged it up the escarpment . John had an instinct for darkness . As though by feel he found the tunnel again . There was bloody rage in the Rooster 's voice behind him . John did n't mind . He was behind him , after all . " Fire and fury , Weasel ! " cried the Rooster . John did n't mind . He heard his Rooster slam himself against stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that either . " Dog 's head ! " he sang , climbing against the current and pulling a hollow skull . " Dog 's head ! " Three apparitions exploded from the hole . The Animals were appalled by each and each . A skull came skidding out , grinning , deathly . A Weasel appeared , harassed and panting . He nearly col/lapsed to catch his breath , but a Rooster leaped into the light and attacked him . The Animals stumbled backward . Chauntecleerswiped savagely at John Wesley , slashing his haunch . Gaff opened a long wound . The Weasel did not defend himself . He took off running as best he could upstream , coloring the water with his blood . But the Rooster was fixed on that Beast . His comb was torn from his brow , his beak stove in , and someone thought he saw a tear in the Cock 's eye . It was no tear . It was a threadlike worm dangling from the tear duct . Chauntecleer streaked to the neck of Black-Pale and drove his weapons into flesh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reacted to the pain . He lurched like an engine and bounded where the Weasel went . The Animals caught that intensity . Some crime had been committed . Some shivering excitement was in the air . And blood flowed in the water . They followed the Rooster . This was no mindful choosing : he came and he left with a blistering passion ; passionately they jammed the canyon behind him , running , galloping , making of themselves a wild stampedeJohn Wesley both heard and felt the pursuit , for it troubled the bedrock . He was racing the ledge , now , rounding bends and pumping his little legs like springs . His lungs were raging . His left hind leg was numb . But he dashed the canyon , John Wesley Weasel , some precious distance ahead of the herd . Oh , he had infuriated his Rooster . He 'd done that before . But never before had Chauntecleer hacked him for it . Poor John Wesley ! He did n't know what he 'd done . But his Rooster was up in daylight again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . But he was a broken Weasel and could not climb giant steps . A dying Weasel . At the last instant he cut right and dived into the Coyote 's Den , sliding across the floor to the back , where he curled into a ball . Two pups were knocked aside . Mama Coyote shied to thep237wall away from him . Well , he was bleeding and looked filthy with combat . " Shh ! " John Wesley put a paw to his mouth and made the only sound left to him , for he had no breath . Shaking his head , he warned them , " Shh . Shh . " But who had counted on the courage of Benoni Coyote , the great and innocent heart of that pup ? " Double-doo ! " he said . " You 're cut , " he said . He put his paw on the helpless Weasel 's shoulder . There was such sympathyin his manner . John Wesley gulped at the air . " Shh . Shh . " " It 's the enemy , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried so hard to talk . But Benoni stood up , foursquare on his paws , his fur like a nimbus . He had a grave expression on his face . He knew this was no game . " Me too , Double-doo , " he said . " Mighty like my papa , a warrior like you . " He turned and went out . His mama gasped . Then she blazed the Den with a mother 's cry , " Benoni ! " And in a flash she was behind him . With all his might John dragged to the doorway . And then he had to hump his back to keep the other pups , bleating their fears , inside . But this is what he saw : He saw the careening charge of the Animals , caught in a narrow strait , and who could stop them ? He saw a mother snatch her child in desperate jaws , and a great black Stag rise rampant above them , trying to stop , the furious Rooster at his neck and the driving weight of Animals behind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stag . The first Beasts twisted themselves aside , but the latter kept coming , and the mama was down below them all , saving her child by crawling toward the wall . But a hoof stunned her , and a hoof wounded her , and the continual passage of hooves beat her down , and one of them killed her . And this is what John Wesley saw :  |p238Benoni  Coyote , caught in his mother 's jaws ; but he could not free himself however he wriggled , because she was dead . " Mama ? " His mouth formed the word . " Mama ? " The Animals swirled in the narrow canyon , full of brutal confusions . The Stag still reared above the mother and child . Chauntecleer cut his spur into Black-Pale 's muscle . When the Stag came down , then , in the midst of the turmoil , his hoof hit something soft . And something snapped . Then Benoni rolled free of his mother and lay still . And her mouth was open , but his was closed , a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dead as well . That is what John Wesley saw . The terrible bugling of the Stag , finally , froze all the hearts in the canyon . Oh , Black-Pale began to bugle a primitive grief . The Animals drew away from him , and there they saw the murders , and then they understood . Soon , they began a moaning too . But Black-Pale 's cry was inconsolable . Still bugling , he threw his body hard against the ice of the canyon wall . Once . Twice . Three times . Deadly blows , till the Cock was shaken free and fell . Bugling still , Black-Pale mountedthe stones at the northern closure and bounded away . The Animals followed . The Rooster was left behind to pull himself from the stream . He stood lost a moment . He looked at two bodies lying in a certain peace . Then , consciously , he did not look at them . He left . He took himself slowly downstream , the oppositeof the others . All of this  --  with two babies behind him , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . He began to cry . Weasels can cry . And white , and lightly as forgetfulness , touching torment like the wings of angels , it began to snow . Here ends the third part of the book of our sins . Oremus ! Illumina , quaesumus , Domine , tenebras nostras  --   |p241It  was snowing , now , in a steady , silent dead-fall , filling all the little burrows of the earth , drifting mildly , blanketing everything with a kind of white amnesia . Maybe God said , " Let it snow . " Maybe God had meant it mercifully . But for Pertinax Cobb , who lay in a foreign hole because he could n't keep pace with the Animals but would n't go home without news , for Pertinax beneath the snow , it was oppressive , and he felt so lonely . The snow kept whiskering the ground above him , like some mammal sniffing the darkness . It sifted across a quiet earth , pretending to be as light as ghosts ; but that was a lie because it was heavy after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drifts above him . He was a Cobb cut off . That would have been just fine , if there had been two Cobbs together . Many a winter he and Mrs. Cobb had gnawed nuts in a chamber five feet below the cold , and he had told her stories , and half of them were fictions , but she would say , " You 're wonderful , Mr. Cobb , " so the fiction had had its truth . But Mrs. Cobb was nowhere near him now . He missed her . And the whispering snow made him miss her the more . Pertinax was homesick . Mrs. Cobb was a very important person . He knew that now . When it snowed at the Hemlock , the Hens and the Mice woke up in wonder . They walked grinning onto the pillowed Liverbrook , making tracks and marveling at the cleanliness . They were very quiet a while . Oh , holy snow !  |p242Change  itself was welcome in the Fimbul Winter . But then the Brothers Mice made miniature plows of themselves , and they raced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They squealed in perfect delight . So then other Animals joined the fun , because what do you make of snow ? You make fun ! Down the Liverbrook slid some Squirrels ; and Squirrels shook clots of snow from the trees . Sparrows played lancet games in the twigs . The dumpy Partridge cried , " Dear me ! " scandalized at herself for acting so silly . The Fawn De La Coeur tried to romp in a broad field of snow . Chalcedony the Hen watched her , doubtful . And when the Fawn went down in a white explosion , this Hen was sure she 'd seen an injury : children are so careless ! But when the Fawn clambered to her feet again , breathless with laughter , why , the crippled Hen cackled till the tears ran from her eyes . Children are such a blessing ! And this was the first time she had seen the child to laugh . Oh , the times , they were improving . It snowed a gentle snow upon the earth , and Pertelote looked on in silence . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not laugh . She was mourning Chauntecleer . Pertinax felt a tremor . Instantly he was alert . He felt another and another until he knew it for a steady rhythm , and then he was sure of his facts : someone was coming . He punched his way to the surface of the world , popped out , and sat like a question on top of a drift . He looked north and gasped at the sight , for the valley had gone so lovely in the snow . It was a deep and dazzling bowl , an amphitheater all white and silent , and old , and old . " Hoo ! " said Pertinax at such grandeur . The snow had made eternity visible . But someone was coming . There was that thrumming , thrumming through the ground  --   |p243Aye  ! There ! See ? News ! At the northern rim of the valley a Beast appeared as black as a midnight memory . It sailed the lip , then descended the long fells , bounding beautifully , kicking white clouds behind it . Pertinax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran for excitement , then watched again . News ! Marvelous speed in that Creature ! Majesty , and a marvelous large head . No ! ' T was a great rack of antlers on him , laid back because his face was raised . Yes ! A Deer . Pertinax stood severeand squealed inside his chest : the Animals were coming home again ! Cobb , the Ground Squirrel of hypercuriosities : he 'd get to hear it first of all . And then what ? Then he 'd tell it to Mrs. Cobb , that 's what . That Deer , that messenger , never slacked , but bounded twenty feet a leap , his forelegs knifing softer snow , his hind like pistons whirling snow into the air . Pertinax could n't stand it . He cried out , " Bring us the news ! " And he ran to stand directly in the Deer 's path . So up the near side of the valley lunged the Deer , and Pertinax saw mucus streaking a black flank , and blood on the shoulder ; and Pertinax heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew his name " **28;13837;TOOLONG ! " he cried . " Stop ! Tell me the  --  " But the Stag did not stop , did not even hear the cry . The Stag burst by him , destroying the world in blizzard and blindness , thunderbooms beside him ; and Cobb went tumblingbackward ; but Cobb caught sight , through the cloud , of Black-Pale 's eye  --  and Cobb grew cold . He stared at the Stag 's retreating , until the woods had hiddenhim and the crystal cloud had sunk again . He stared till the land was quiet . There was a memory nagging his mind . " His eye , " said Pertinax . " It was like  --  " Once in a drought , the Squirrel had gone down a narrowp244shaft which should have ended in a reservoir of water . But the bottom was dusty , hollow and dry ; and the Squirrel despaired . " The eye of that Deer is an empty well , " said Pertinax . And he said , " The news is n't good news , is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the south : the snow fell fine and beautiful , with a soundless flake . There was the sense of motheringcome to a drowsy child , someone tucking the world to sleep . Animals were thankful for the featherbed . But in the north , those several nights , the snow was a dissatisfiedhag : bitch-winter beating the earth with her stick . Bitter crystals blew hard and horizontal so that the Animals lowered their heads and turned away . If someone tried to see where he was , his eyeballs stung for the trouble , as though punished for looking  --  and he saw nothing anyway . So the Sheep simply stopped on a hillside  --  the lee side , they hoped , but they did n't know . They were leaderless , and their own poor senses had been whited out . They pressed together in a flock , all of them hanging their heads , not one of them lying down , for fear that he might be covered and smothered and lost forever . Or , maybe Sheep were just too stunned to think of lying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd wait the weather standing up still . They stood , leaderless . They stood like plain cattle in the blizzard . They packed their tails against their anuses and stood motionless . And this is how submissive the Sheep were : they did n't so much as shake the hoarfrost from their faces . Their own breathing bearded them ; their exhalations froze , and the white beards grew , because no one told them to move . It 's a perilous thing , to be leaderless and obedient at once . When there 's no command to obey , then " No " becomes the only command , and a heartless one : No to instincts , no to boldness , no to newness even in this witching weather ; then no to survival , and no to life . Do n't move ! How do you know your movement is n't for the worse ? Then stand still and hang your heads , Sheep , Sheep ! And the harder the storm blows ,  |p245the  meeker the Sheep . The worse the conditions , the morethey yearn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leaderless , there was nothing to do but nothing . Leaderless , they just stood still , and the Hag shrieked all around them , cursing them , beating them with her stick . Leaderless , Sheep are lost . There was one Creature untroubled by the blizzard and the extremities of the north . Boreas the White Wolf had an eye as cold and pale as the ice , and a paw so wide it walked the drifts , thick-shank fur , a powerful neck , and a heart impervious to hostilities or friendship , either one . Boreas trod snow as if he were the snow , carelessly . And he moved of a perfectly free will through any wind of the winter . Boreas stood on a high ridge , watching the dispersion of the Animals . If he helped none of them , it was n't because he wished them ill ; simply , he had another purpose on his mind , and nothing disturbed his purposes . He was interested in the state of one being only . Let the others pass . Now Notos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misery . He blew on his knuckles . He hated the knifing wind . " Let 's go , " he growled . " Did you see it ? " Boreas asked , not so much as flicking his eye . Eurus and Favonius and the grey Chinook stepped closer . Notos swore an oath . " I ca n't see nothing , I do n't care for nothing , I 'm freezing to death , dammit ! Let 's  --  " " I saw a weakness . " The White Wolf heard what he wished to hear . Presently he was deaf to complaints . Chinook said , " I saw it , too . Let it be . " " No . No , " Boreas mused slowly . " There 's a crack in the Rooster . There 's a flaw somewhere : him , his mind , his rule , his authority , I wonder . I do n't know ; I wonder . " He swung his head round to look at Chinook . They were shadows in the unobstructed wind , their fur in whorls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep does it go , I wonder ? " said Boreas.  |p246Notos  , finally , spat a filthy word at the both of them and started off in the blizzard . Boreas finished his thought first , saying , " The times are changing , count on it . " Then he raised his eyes after Notos . " He thinks he 's going south , " he said . Eurus and Favonius shrugged . " He is n't , " they said . " Well , go with him then , " said Boreas . " The four of you , take your way to the Rooster 's land again , and watch for the flaw . I 'll watch for it here  --  " Boreas lingered alone on his ridge thereafter , allowing the wind its ripping of his coat . He did n't move . He wanted to assess the Rooster . He wondered , coolly : what the possibilities .... At the dying of the blizzard and the bare beginning of dusky light , String Jack grew bold . He put his face out of the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since all the world had changed  --  he crept forward on a blue , sculptured land . He hopped carefully across the crusty snow , feeling estranged and endangered : this was a world too smooth to be true , its valleys and hills ceramic , and the silence too mystic . He did n't know where to go . He 'd lost his bearings . String Jack had passed the storm in a personal hole , as had all of his kin , here , there , and everywhere ; and now he went looking for them with greater and greater panic , because he could not find them . The world had changed , and the family was scattered . Smells were gone ; so he felt as though his nose itself was gone . His stretching ears heard nothing . And what did his eyes see ? A stark and lifeless land . No , it was worse than that . He saw statues ! He saw on a hillside statues of the most unnatural sort of Creature : they stood five-legged , the fifth leg where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there was not just one of this mutant breed ; there was a whole herd , frozen , timeless.  |p247String  Jack 's ears popped up like exclamation points , indeed . Then he canceled them straightway , afraid that they 'd been seen . And then he canceled himself , in a high-speed decision to quit this museum  --  with his relatives or without them . The world had changed ! How could a Hare understand what he could n't name , or approach what he 'd never seen before ? All he could do was escape . All he could be was afraid . And all had to be handled alone  --  for strangeness and fears divide the closest of kin .... Of course not : these were no abnormal beings that the Hare had seen . They were Sheep , mere Sheep . But the frost on their faces had frozen like stumps of ice to the ground , and they were every one imprisoned in their low servility , bowing down with no other choice left to them . Their heads had turned to legs  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , and still the poor Sheep stood . They could neither lie down nor walk , though in this more peaceful weather they might have chosen either  --  to rest , or to go home . Ice-locked ! Slave-locked to nothing . Lord Chauntecleer had brought them north . But Lord Chauntecleer was not taking them home again . The Sheep were abandoned to the tendencies of their own natures . But Sheep under Sheep are under no one , and freedomfor them becomes captivity . They did n't even bleat . They stood on five legs and waited . Bowed down . In the same dim , morning light , Boreas saw him . From the ridge the Wolf looked down upon the singular Cock , Lord Chauntecleer , passing southward all alone . Alone the Rooster went , but not at ease . He was dragging something after him with a great deal of effort . It did n't slidep248well , whatever it was , and the snow impeded it . It moved by yanking , or by pushing ; and often the Rooster swept it clean with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Chauntecleer jerked erect . He issued a short cry , immediately cut off ; then he doubled down and coughed . He thrust his head forward , coughing violently as though strangled . His wings thrashed the snow on either side , till a final wretching spewed up an enormous gorge . Chauntecleer crowed and attacked that gorge , moving with such force and clean direction that Boreas shook his head . " No , not yet , " he whispered . " Not weak enough yet . " Below , the Rooster stood still a moment , by habit ruffling his feathers after a fight . He sighed and returned to the cargo , his sledge , and push by push drove it southward ahead of him . Boreas slipped the ridge , then , and descended to identify the Rooster 's adversary . Worms . They were worms . Two score worms as thin as thread , eachone cut precisely in the middle , a single drop of blood foreach , and the blood , though dark  --  it was not red . Boreas lifted his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coughing again . Then , distantly , the cry . He said , " The times are changing . " Thirty-sixWith Safety of His InnocenceJohn Wesley had no use in his left hindleg , now , at all . His movement was handicapped and heavy . And the night was dark , the darker for the snow falling . But he could not bear top249see the two Coyote bodies simply sink in snow . He could n't bear for snow to sift into the mama 's mouth or to drift on Benoni 's face . They lay near one another on the terrace where they died , exactly as the Animals had left them at leaving . It was up to John , now . The babies Twill and Hopsacking had fallen asleep against each other , tired for staying in the Den and waiting for their mother to come . That was a goodness , that they slept . So John had gone out . He had pulled himself to Benoni , and he was stroking the child to brush the snow away , and he was thinking that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , for Benoni and his mama to lie together ; he was thinking , Why could n't he find such a place , or was there such a place in all the world where nobody would hurt them again . He was thinkingthese things when Ferric came . " Oh , " said Ferric , and John saw him , and he stopped strokingthe baby . The Coyote stood with his side to the wall , as though shy . A Bird slipped from his back . The Coyote put his cheek to the wall , too , and closed his eyes . " Oh , no , " he said . John said , " Papa ? " The Bird huddled in the snow . The Coyote pushed and pushed himself against the wall as if it would give way for him . When he glanced at the bodies , he pushed harder . All at once he stood straight up with a busy expression on his face . He looked at Rachel , and he said , " One  --  " He looked at Benoni , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infinite questioning at the Weasel , and poor John did n't know what to say . " One , " whined the Coyote . It was a terribly important number . And the next was worse . " Two ? " He pleaded with John : " Two ? " John felt pity and an utter helplessness . " But Papa , " he whispered , " what 's for a Double-u to say ? " " One ! " begged Ferric , nearly desperate . " Two ! " Who could understand him ? Suddenly he ran to the Den . He thrust his head inside andp250stood still . Then he backed out again . " Three , " he said . " Four , " he said , thinking long about these numbers . " Oh , Papa ! " John Wesley cried too loud . " Is okay . Them babies is sleeping ! " " Sleeping ? " said the Coyote , fixing John , the Savior , with a hungry stare . " Sleeping , do you think ? " He came to John . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Rachel ? " he asked . " Um , yes . " John dropped his own eyes . " Is Mama Coyote , yes , " he saidFerric said , " Please , what is your name ? " " Urn . Well . John , " said the Weasel . " John , " said the Coyote with true fervor . John , is Rachel sleeping , too ? " The Weasel mumbled , " No . " " Oh , please , John ! " The Coyote 's eyes were burning him . " Not sleeping ? What else is there ? If she is n't sleeping , then what is she , John ? " " Wooden Coyote , does n't you know ? " " Rachel is my wife , " said the Coyote as though this informationmight assist the Weasel . " Nothing ever troubles her . She does n't worry about anything . She smiles . " " Wooden Coyote , " said John . " Do n't . " " She knows how to laugh . " " Wooden Coyote ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No ! " " Oh , wooden Coyote  --  oh , yes . She is . " " Do you , " said Ferric , still glaring at John . " Do you know a pup , a brave pup named Benoni  --  " John Wesley Weasel simply turned and began to drag his useless leg away. "  --  he is my son , " the Coyote continued to talk to the spot where the Weasel had been . " He is my  --  He is  --  " John passed the darkness of the Den . " Oh , Coyote , " hep251whispered to the night , John , he is so sorry for all we has done to you . " But there was a silence behind him . He turned back and saw that the thin Coyote had finally looked upon his family . As gently as the snow itself , he was dipping his snout to the woman , Rachel , stretched upon the ground . Tenderly , he licked her face . Tenderly , he washed her . Then he stopped with his nose on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips back until it seemed that he was grinning , his nose pressed to her brow . But he was n't grinning ; his voice was thick . " Rachel , " he said . " I 'm so cold . Are you cold , too ? " John Wesley wanted to race up the stone steps and away , screaming curses at the universe . But he bowed his head instead . Then the scream that came  --  it was n't his own . The poor Coyote wailed , " Benoni ! Benoni ! Why is your tongue stuck out ? Could n't someone put your tongue away ? Oh , Benoni ! " John tried as hard as he could to get to the steps , wounded by the Coyote 's cry , feeling his own tears start at his eyes . But , " John ! " cried the Coyote again in the night . " Where are you ? " " Here , wooden Coyote , " he said . " Is Twill sleeping ? Is Hopsacking sleeping ? " " Yes , wooden Coyote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , wooden Coyote . Yes . " " Do n't go . " " John , he gots to go . " " Please , John , please ! There 's something you have to tell me . " " Oh , wooden Coyote , let John go . " " Just one more thing . " Ferric bounded toward the Weasel , then immediately turned away , dropping his head between the bodies and the ground itself , but unable to look at the Weasel any more.  | " What , wooden Coyote . " " Tell me  --  " Ferric ceased in shivering . " I 'm sorry . I 'm cold , " he said . Indeed . The blizzard was just beginning above them , and the wind said O00000 in the Pine . " Can you tell me again , " said Ferric humbly , " what Benoni said about his papa ? " John Wesley choked . Poor John  --  he was stuck all over again , and what was he to do ? " Benoni says , he misses his papa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . The Coyote lay down to weep . John looked at the furry pup-form , lying like his father , one and two . " Benoni says , he loves his papa with a very big , big love . " Ferric wept , " Thank you , John . " And John Wesley wept , " Is nothings , wooden Coyote . " When Coyotes howl in the dead of night a long and plaintivewailing ; when they round their mouths to the empty sky and sing shrill notes , this is what they say : they say , Son of mysorrow , where have you gone ? They are the voice , lamentation and bitter weeping ; they are weeping for their children . And they refuse to be comforted for their children , because they are not . This is the way of the world . The children die . John Wesley heard that howling when the storm began . He heard it in spite of the blizzard , in spite of the pine around him , in spite of the fact that Ferric was wailing from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Ferric was wailing to heaven itself. **32;13867;TOOLONG  --  he thought no thoughts whateverwhile he ran . It was an impulse of the heart that drove him . It was right to go fast , that was all . It was right never , never to stop . It was right to reach the extremities of physical exertion , to crack his lungs in the run , to hear a mortal rattling there , to taste the blood . He asked no farther than rightness ; just now the rightness was all , no reasons , no reasons . But there was a reason . In fact , there were two . Barely felt at the tip of his hoof , but tingling there however hard or often he struck the ground , was the sensation of a soft snap . Black-Pale was fleeing the name of that feeling . He was escaping the remembrance of the act and the title that should attach to him forever for what he had done . But names and memories are swifter than wind in pursuit . Therefore he could n't pause , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he possibly could : he was racing thought itself . And he sought fatigue , and he wished to be tired , and he wanted to drop , unconscious before his , body hit ground . But God had given him a remarkable heart , both noble and strong . He ran . He accomplished a marvel , though no one ever knew it : aground , in snow , the Stag ran faster longer than the Hawk in the air could fly , a grueling , unrecorded marathon . And the reason why , all thoughtlessly , he tended toward the Hemlock was : he wanted to see his daughter . He never once thought this yearning through ; it was too dangerous to consider . Yet in him was the terrible need to see if she was still all right . More precisely : to see if she was still alive.  |p254Mindless  , then , the Stag broke into the camp of the Animals , woofing a hollow , wretched breath , stamping the ground because he could not be still and because he was seeking his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he threw his head from side to side , seeking . The mucus was strung with beads of a startling red . " Have you seen her ? " he rasped to no one in particular , would have heard none if any had answered . But the Animals simply stood aside . He looked fanatical . " Have you seen her ? " he asked with greater intensity , rushingamong the breeds . The intensity grew in him because his own words told him why he 'd come : for her . Thought was waking , and with it a true panic for the Fawn . At the Liverbrook , finally , he abused his lungs once more , swelling them past their capacity . He threw himself rampant , the better to see , the louder to cry , and he bugled all down the stream to Wyrmesmere : " De La Coeur ! De La Coeur ! Where are you , De La Coeur ! " " Papa ! " Her tiny , surprised bleat . She was behind him . Black-Pale came down twisting himself so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forehooves caught the ground , his mouth was closed ; and something else was beginning to close . " Papa ! Oh , Papa , you 're back ! " The child was so happy she could hardly walk straight , De La Coeur his daughter , dappled , alive and blameless , and  --  O God , who can understand these things ?  --  and a knife in his very soul . She came to him sideways like a pup in her excitement , laughing in her dark eyes , because he was her father and she was his daughter , and he was home again . No such child would in like manner meet the Coyote at his Den . Homecoming there would be a different thing . And why was this ? Why would a Coyote weep to be told that his child was dead ? And why , please . Say it , please . Because **28;13901;TOOLONG had with his own hoof killed the child !  |p255Murderer  ! " Papa ! Such things I have to tell you , my aunty and me ! " De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stag lowered his head , almost as it were for battle , presenting his antlers ; but then he swung it to the side " Oh ! " the Fawn gave a tiny cry . " You 're cut . Aunty , Papa 's been cut . And his neck and his shoulders , how deep ! " The Fawn and a crippled Hen together approached BlackPale , full of concerns for him . Before they reached him , in a restless gesture  --  a nearly threatening gesture , if any had thought that possible  --  he jerked his body backward . Here was the tragedy . Here was the knowledge that flooded Black-Pale now : he could not look upon his daughter , no , not with his eyes , because he was a murderer ; she did not know this ; he did ; and what had he killed ? A child . He pawed through the snow to the ice of the Liverbrook , his head still cast to the side . " Papa , let us put a salve  --  " Crack ! Black-Pale struck the ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , confused . The shock of his strike shook something loose inside his chest . Black-Pale heaved out his breath , and with it came a dollop of the brightest blood , impossibly red in white snow . This time De La Coeur 's concern was no minor daughterly thing ; it was scribbled with true fear , and she came forward in low voice : " You 're not well . It was hard on you , Papa . But Aunty  --  " Crack ! Crack ! Twice more , with all the might in his shoulder , all the weight of his great body , Black-Pale struck the ice , the same hoof , the same place . The Fawn pulled herself up short . Ice chips hit her . The expression on her face began to show its own pain . " Papa ? " Crack ! And even while he splintered and chopped at the Liver/brook , his breathing bubbled up more and more blood . He was digging a hole . He spat in the snow around him . " Oh , Papa , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You are so hurt . Ca n't I  --  " Crack ! " Ca n't I come to you ? What is the matter ? " Crack ! " Wo n't you look at me ? Papa  --  " Crack ! " Papa ! " bawled the poor Fawn , bending forward and thrusting her head toward him like any Calf : " What did I do ? Why are you mad at me ? " And when , with a final , tremendous blow , the Stag broke through and rammed his leg to the shoulder in icy waters , she cried , " Are n't you glad to see me any more ? Papa ? " But this is what Black-Pale was doing : he was trying to cleanse his hoof of the blood of the baby , to shock from it the feel of a backbone snapping . He 'd splintered utterly that hoof . He 'd compacted his knee and fractured the shin . And now the water was numbing it all  --  and still that snap , and still the soft sensation lingered , indelible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow . He spoke . Not to answer De La Coeur , nor even to address her . It was as though she were n't there . She began a keening , heartbrokenmoan . She could n't help herself . She was just a child . It was to the Hen that Black-Pale spoke . He said , " She calls you aunty . " He said , " Well and good . Now let her call you mother . " He said , " She needs a parent . She needs that goodness . She is your child , now , forever and ever till the end , your child  --  " This was the last thing he said . While his daughter watched him , he withdrew the offending leg from its bloody puncture in the brook ; he stood shakily and began to walk away to the south . Suddenly De La Coeur raised her voice to the highest sorrowshe had inside of her and cried after him : " But what did I do wrong ? Papa ! Papa ! Papa ! "  |p257He  did n't stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the stumbling alone that dropped him . For a while his legs continued a walking motion , though he lay on his side ; but this was because he 'd been granted his heart 's wish . He 'd slipped into unconsciousness . God had created him a noble character , **28;13931;TOOLONG , so that he could not countenance a treachery , not even when the sinner was himself . Coma was his refuge . And in this way the child became the mother . De La Coeur never left her father 's side again , but nursed him day and night , while Chalcedony looked after both of them . The Fawn continually wiped blood from her father 's muzzle and sang to him when he was wracked with coughing . She could do this without his denying it now , could love him anyway , because he was unconscious . Thirty-eightIn the House AloneWith Chalcedony and the Fawn De La Coeur , Pertelote ministeredto Black-Pale . She brought him simples and nursed the wounds on his neck and shoulder . But his lungs were too deep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . While she bound the shivered leg , she said , " He said noth-ing ? " " No , Lady . Nothing , " said Chalcedony . " Or something , " she said , " But not so 's we 'd understand  --  " And she paused . Pertelote completed the sentence : "  --  understand what happened to Chauntecleer . " " Aye . Nothing of Lord Chauntecleer . " This was not the return that Pertelote had expected . Somep258heroic triumph , maybe  --  though she had , in fact , prepared herself for failure ; she was not convinced that her husband could defeat Wyrm in his lair . Some sadness , certainly  --  because she 'd imagined a thousand deaths for the Rooster and dreamed them nightly . But sadness can be consoled . She had not anticipated so grieved a Creature as Black-Pale was , nor such determined self-destruction . She pierced the swelling of his fetlock . The ruptured blood ran out , slow , purple blood from his beautiful tool for walking . She caressed the leg . She thought : he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he carries a secret in his breast . But his mouth and his eyes were closed together , now ; he would not be telling it . She looked at the overheated bustle that Chalcedony was making of herself and had the grace to smile . The Hen was embarrassed to feel so pleased under these circumstances . " Something , " Pertelote said to her sister . " What was that something that he said ? " " Ooo , Lady , " said Chalcedony . " That the child was mine . That I 'm to be her mother . What d' you think of that ? " Pertelote returned the question . " What do you think of it , Chalcedony ? " The crippled Hen sat down at gazed at De La Coeur , the child of aristocracy , and of the melting eye . " I say , " said Chalcedony , " I do n't know . It 's an uncommon request , surely , and maybe not fitting for nurses to be mothers . Ah , Lady , but I love the child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself saying , " whispered the Hen , " And why may n't Chalcedony have a pretty child of her own ? ' Ooo , Lady . " Pertelote went to the little Hen and hugged her . " The heart has reasons , " said Pertelote . " Sister , I say the same . " Cobb came home with an illicit air about him . But he hadalways been straightforward . Pertelote was not encouraged . Jasper the fat Hen , greasy in her busy motion and ratherpouncing in her question , saw him slipping to the Liverbrook.  | " Well ! " she shouted : hail-Squirrel-well-met . " Glad you 're back ! What happened , then ? Everybody fine ? " The Squirrel looked smitten by the ambush , unable to answer for himself . He peered past all the Animals till he caught sight of his wife , then he lowered his head and sneaked toward her . " To the hole , Mrs. Cobb , " he snapped . She said , " It 's so good to see you again , Mr. Cobb . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paws to her chest with the same sunny smile that was always reserved for him . " Well , " she said . " Tell us the news , Mr. Cobb . " He said , as though he knew , " It is n't good news . " " Oh , I 'm sorry , " she said . " What happened ? " But the Squirrel turned taciturn and barked with a louder irritation : " To the hole , Mrs. Cobb ! " So then , nothing was learned from him but negatives . Pertelote 's spirits slipped a degree . She had kept the crows in Chauntecleer 's absence , though in Pertelote 's throat they were songs . This night , as always , she sang a Compline of peace , but she was n't sure whether to believe it . Hard it was to roost alone at night . Harder to think that this condition would last forever . But hardest of all was not to know . Something else took place . How could she shape the future while she remained ignorant of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling the night sky above her as silently as the Owl ; but she felt it . When she was finished , then , she went to find it . Never , never did Perteloteshrink from knowledge . Sharpshin the Hawk sat on a stump . He did not greet her but perched with his shoulders hunched , his beak hooked , his figure dark and stern . She took her place below him . " Sharpshin , " she said . " Lady , " he answered.  | " You came back , " she said . " I did . For the moment . " " But you did n't dive from the sky . " " I did n't . " " Was that because of the snow ? " " I can stoop in any weather , Lady . " " Ah , " she said . " Yes , you can . " He sat still above a field of infinite snow , volunteering nothing . She felt lonely . She felt , somehow , judged by the Hawk that would not look at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of events  --  unkind , because she had to ask to discover them . Yet this was the very reason for which he came , to be interrogated . It was his obligation . And she was obliged to ask . She did . She said , " Please , sir . What happened in the north ? Was  --  some  --  good accomplished ? " " Wyrm is dead , " said Sharpshin . Oh , what extraordinary news ! She turned and grinned at him . But , oh ! What a deadly way he had of delivering it . Her happiness was not his . He gave it and he judged it at once , the frowning Hawk . " Dead ? " she whispered , wishing some other attitude . " That , " said Sharpshin , " is what the Weasel screamed . And the Weasel saw . " " John Wesley Weasel was there ? " " The Weasel . The warrior . He 's everywhere , is n't he ? " " Wyrm is dead ? " " Dead . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next question  --  too much for a single answer . Too much of the present and all of their future . " How is Lord Chaunte-cleer ? " In very waves the Hawk 's severe opinion came down . He did not answer immediately . In spite of herself , Pertelote looked at him with piteous desire . Well , it was her husband after all ! She saw that he was considering how to speak.  |p261Finally  , " Living , " said the Hawk , and that was all . " Living . " Pertelote caught her breath . Chauntecleer had not died ! Was n't that a good thing ? A wonder ? And should n't someone rejoice ? " He 's coming back , then ? " she whispered . Sharpshin said , " I do not know the mind of the Rooster . " He blinked , closing a subject . The blink came from the back of his head . " These are the facts . I 've communicated them to you , " he said . " Now : I 've one thing left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He spread his wings and by slow strokes flew midnight to the north . He left her by the stump in a snowfield . But there were so many questions . What of Mundo Cani ? And where was someone to celebrate her husband 's life ? His triumph ? Wyrm 's death ? Was n't it a good thing that Wyrm should be dead , a marvelous accomplishment ? Lord , the presentwas so obscure : what would the future be ? And why , if Chauntecleer was somewhere alive , did she feel so close to tears ? That night Pertelote paced the beaten snow of the Liverbrook . Wodenstag Mouse woke up with a sharp premonition andwith joy . He 's here ! he thought . The dear Rooster 's come home again ! He smiled without moving another muscle . He stirred no other Brother in the burrow . He allowed delight to flow through his little body a while , and then a warm contentment , and then the warmth alone , and then sleep . All night the pacing above ground encouraged dreams about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dreams . Therefore , when he crept across the snow to the Hemlock , he could n't understand why the plain whiteness disappointed him so deeply ; yet he wanted to cry . And when he saw Pertelotealone on her branch , that loneliness seemed a greater grief than yesterday . Why ? He felt so bad , but he did n't know why . Then Pertelote saw him , and they looked at one another inp262a sort of privacy , the Hen and the Mouse , each one knowing that the other knew so little . They shrugged together . They gave each other silly smiles , grateful , each , that someone saw the sadness and did n't ask the reasons , since they had none . With their looking alone they said , I 'll watch over you . Will you watch over me ? And both of them smiled again , and that meant Yes and Thank you , both . How good , to have a friend ! How necessary . The day to come was not a kind one . The Goats came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the various rules or properties of other breeds , heedless of the quiet . The Goats came shaking the snow from their coats and braying a list of their misfortunes . The Goats  --  permitted some swagger and some allowances because of their adventure  --  or else , perhaps , because of their misfortunes ? Who knows ? What are the sources of pomposity ? How does a demanding spirit justify itself ? Or does that even mat-ter ? The Goats came . They were tired . Mark how tired they were . They were cold . They were , they were bound to announce , less than pleased with the whole trip , from which they had received one lousy moment of excitement and diarrhea . They drilled the snow with brown holes to prove the latter claim , and cried out , " See ? See ? " each time they did . And they were hungry . Breakfast ! Where was their breakfast ? Well , that was the job of the Brothers Mice , who took their duties seriously ; so Wodenstag and his brothers brought roots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roots , snatching them straight from the Mice with their blocks of teeth , and no thanks out of their mouths.  |p263The  other Goats , however , filled their mouths with speeches about selfishness and demanded their breakfasts at once , since they had done no less than those two and were probably twice as hungry . It bothered Wodenstag to bring more food than was absolutelynecessary , seeing the emptiness growing in the bins ; but he did . The Brothers brought roots again , garnished with a little leaf . They arranged the foodstuffs prettily for the returned adventurers . And then they were mortified by what the Goats didThey stomped on the food . They kicked it through the air . They ground it underneath the snow . And they urinated on it . On food ! Food ! Wodenstag said , " I thought you were hungry . " " You thought that because we told you that , " said the Goats . " We said hungry , ' " said the Goats : " Haw-ngry ! Hawngry ! So what did you get us ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An insult ! " brayed the Goats . " You insult us with these tiny piles of foods . What do you think we are ? You think we are low as Mice ? Haw-ngry ! The tribes of Hophni and Phinehasneed substances for their guts  --  but this ! We loathe your worthless food ! " Poor Wodenstag tried to explain : " But everybody eats the same  --  " " Hey ! Hey ! Do you think we are everybody ? " brayed the Goats . " Oh , no . You 're Goats , to be sure  --  " " Then bring us eatings fit for Goats ! " " Which is  --  ? " " Lots ! " they roared . " Lots and lots ! Haw-ngry ! " Well , that was more than Wodenstag could handle . But he could n't just give away food according to Beasts ' requests , or no one would be eating soon . Well , and he thought that the Goats could be dangerous , so then he was frightened , too  --   |p264He  went to Pertelote , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's not your job , I know , " Wodenstag began , apologetic over his inability , " but  --  " His brothers had no such apology . They were simply outraged by the Goats ' behavior , and they said so in squeaking tumult . " Honk-ry ! " they mimicked the Goats with distaste : " Honk-ry ! What kind of a way is that to talk ? " Then Samstag blurted the most scandalizing thing of all : " They peed on the food ! " he squealed , and all the brothers fell silent . What could anyone say about such vulgarity ? Nothing . Pertelote sighed . Wodenstag felt a rush of pity for that sigh . It was n't just a passing problem they 'd brought her , was it ? Pertelote said , " Thank you , Tags . I 'll see what I can do . " Then the Hen walked in a certain dignity to the Goats ' field , where she paused . Wodenstag crept up behind her and saw what she was seeing : it was simply amazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't a patch of smooth snow left , not a place to lie down in cleanliness . He heard Pertelote sigh one more time , then he himself shrank from the commandand the anger that flashed from her . " Stand still ! " she cried . " Do n't move ! " she cried . Goats blinked their slotted eyes at this sudden appearing and , for the moment , stood still . Pertelote , glaring at them , dug below a yellow snow with unconcealed disgust . She pulled out a root both damp and salty . Then , like a vulture clutching carrion , she took to her wings and flew at the most outspoken Goat . Suddenly she dived for his mouth . She jammed the root into it . She stung his nose with her nails so that he sucked the root inward , and she cried , " Chew ! " One or two other Goats began to leer at this fellow 's discomfiture , but she flew over these with nails for their snouts as well and the hard command , " Shut up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady.  | " Chew it , " she repeated to the first Goat . " You 'll eat what you get , do you hear ? And if you do n't like it seasoned , do n't season it . " The Goat lowered his head , as if to spit the stuff . Straightway Pertelote bolted for his neck and gripped him there in a very strong claw and hissed , " Lord Chauntecleer has two weapons , sir . If you spit one-half that root , Gaff will cut you here . " She drew a line from his ear to his shoulder . His head came up with that line . " If you spit the other half , " she hissed , " the Slasher will cut you here . " She stabbed his jugular . The Goat ate the root . To them all she said , " Surely you do n't wish me to give Lord Chauntecleer a bad report of you , do you ? Surely you will live according to his rules till he comes back  --  wo n't you ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Waaaaal . " " Well , if he can slash a Stag , then he could slash us , too . If he can kill a baby , he 'd kill anyone  --  " Their manner of acquiescence  --  itsounded like snot and was meant to sting . It did . Wodenstag saw Pertelote go rigid . Stiffly , silently , by an amazing self-possession , the Hen stalked from the Goats ' field and into the woods . The BrothersMice came quietly behind , and so they walked some fifty yards , white snow piled at the trunks of trees , each twig its line of white . All at once she whirled around , and she cried , " I know what he means , Slash a Stag . ' I saw that . I do n't understand it ; I saw it . But what does he mean by Kill a baby ' ? " She glared at them . Wodenstag only bowed his head . He had no answer . They both knew that . " Lady , thank you , " said Wodenstag , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression in Pertelote 's face relaxed . " I hate this , " she said to Wodenstag , but there was the ghost of a smile on her woman 's beak . " Did you see what I did ? I threatened them . Ip266made them eat  --  " She shook her head and waved her wing and smiled . " I hate this . " But that was the last moment of smiling that day . Wodenstagwatched her do marvelous things for returning Animals , all the while suffering her own private torment . In the afternoon a flock of Sheep arrived nearly dead from exposure and exhaustion . Pertelote went out to meet them because she 'd seen a Hawk circling in the distant sky and knew it for a sign . At her coming , the Hawk departed without a word of farewell . Pertelote sighed . Her heart broke for the Sheep , though it was n't only their condition that troubled her : it was their abject debasement . They showed no will whatever of their own . She walked , and they walked . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock stopped without a question , stopped and would have waited there until they dropped . It was as though they had no mind any more , or else believed that they deserved no choices , as though they should live in perpetual punishment . They would not so much as bleat to be whipped . So , what had they done ? What had they been led to ? What were they not speaking of ? Dear God , what caused this killing of the soul ? " Gentian , " Pertelote said to the Mice when she 'd brought the flock near unto the hemlock . And with a yearning heart she said , " The herb will ease their insides , Tags . Go get them gentian . " She noticed Wodenstag gazing at her before he left . He had a dear , sympathetic eye . He said , " The Rooster ca n't be far behind , Lady . " She released a sigh so sudden and deep that it surprised herself . " Oh , Wodenstag ! " she said . Cats despised the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it melted it made them wet . But everywhere was snow . They could n't put a paw down but that it touched snow . They could n't raise their faces except the snow flew into them.  |p267Cats  returned in a villainous mood , breathing curses on any who thought to find pleasure in the snow , on Hens and Sparrowsand Mice and any who 'd merely accommodated themselves to the snow , on gladness and laughter and joy , on the Partridge because she was clumsy . Nor did they wait to see the effect of their curses ; it did n't matter ; it was n't vengeance but a pure vexation of the spirit . They held the world in derision , and any who trusted in the goodness of the world they judged to be naive . Nor did they come like the Goats in a herd . Rather , they rambled singly through the camp of Animals so that there was a general deflation of goodwill and universal unease . " We 've seen your goodness , ' " they sneered when Perteloteurged on them the goodness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 've seen goodness ' to its core . It has a maggot in it . " String Jack rushed to the Hemlock , harassed . " Lady ! " he panted . " Lady ! " He sat up and struggled with the words . More than ever his eyes denied each other . " Seen my sister ? " he pleaded . " Seen my cousin ? " But Pertelote had to admit that he was the first Hare to return . " Yep . Yep , " he chattered , panicked . And then , as though unsurprised , " Well  --  " Pertelote 's heart went out to the fretful Creature . She said , " Perhaps Lord Chauntecleer is with  --  " " Oh , Lady ! " String Jack exclaimed as if that were a very uncertain suggestion and probably not to be desired . Then he said , " What 'll I do ? My kin ! My family ! " In distraction he started a little run to the south . He stopped , whirled , and finally darted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of her heart with him . Pertelote was being whittled by her ignorance , smaller andsmaller to nothing . What ? Had Chauntecleer defeated Wyrm ? Or what ? What ? What was she to make of all this ?  |p268The  Pronghorn , the trip-spring Antelope , came more skittishthan ever before . And here was a strange thing : once the voice of a child had been able to calm them . Now the voice of a child sent them flying in alarm . And they could n't bear even to be brushed by the flank of another Creature . They took no comfort in a Hen 's clucking . And the night itself , when it descended , seemed a pall upon their heads . But they could not run from the night . Worse than that , a Wolf would howl in the distant gloom . They were everywhere menaced and nowhere safe . And Pertelote was helpless . She sang a Vespers for hearts she could n't understand , and then it was the Brothers mice who whispered in their hole to one another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chauntecleer was alive . Chauntecleer the Rooster was twice alive and coming home . There was himself . And there were in him the worms . Himself : since every other holy task and every other cause for living had been stripped from him , he 'd settled on one final purpose , and he gave it his whole attention , and he meant to see it completed , and he called it love . By the most strenuouseffort , Chauntecleer was bringing the skull of Mundo Cani home again . A mean proof . A nasty proof , perhaps . But proof enough that he had indeed descended to the Netherworld , and perhaps Pertelote would count it for something . No ! It was n't a nasty proof at all ! It was the right and properp269thing to do , to give this Dog an honorable burial  --  his head , at least . Oh , how Chauntecleer loved the Dog ! How precious , then , the relic of the Dog 's life ! And if anyone wanted to measure the length of his love , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion , his ruination , his self . Look at his toes , gone swollen both purple and black . They were frostbitten and likely gangrenous . There was no feeling left in them . And the snow , the everlasting snow piled up against the skull to push back when the Rooster pushed forward . Snow clouted the skull 's mouth . Snow extruded from its sockets . Snow fouled his good offices and wore him down to death . But the harder the going became , the more certain was the Rooster that he would get that skull to home , and show that skull to praiseworthy effect , and finally bury that skull as it ought to be buried . Having nothing else in all the world , the Rooster spent himself on this one thing only . And so long as it consumed him  --  so long as he could with passion curse the snow and the trouble it took to drag a skull , so long as he truly suffered in his person pain in the progress , so long as he delivered all his intellect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the welcome Mundo Cani would receive , and his pride to the little glory that might redound to him  --  then he could not think of the deaths of a Coyote and her offspring . Could not . Was unable to . No , he could not think of these . He did n't . Himself : Lord Chauntecleer the Rooster crossed the snows of the prairies , pushing a bone ahead of himself . He had his token . But the worms : within him writhed another life , a wriggling in his nasal passages , a multitudinous crawling in his chest , in the muscles of his shoulders and in his gut . Chauntecleer had come up from the cellar of the earth infested with a congregation of threadlike worms  --  green , when they slid through his mouth , irritating when they twitched in his lungs . They had thriven on Wyrm-rot . Now they thrived in him.
