" The way to stay young is to forget , to have a bad memory , " says Mr. Davis . " You know , when a woman says to me : ' Do you remember when we were lovers , five years ago ? ' I say , ' No . ' Guys come up to me with their arms outstretched , I say : ' What ' s that for ? ' And they say , ' 1947 , Chicago , remember ? We got high together . ' I say : ' No . Get out of my face ' . " // This is one of his rare interviews . Mr. Davis - acknowledged in the jazz world as one of the all-time greats - seems wary . " Everything you do , you want to do , but then you don ' t want to be reminded of it , " he says . " Childhood ? Who wants to remember that ? I was born like this. " // Mr. Davis is looking fit and speaking with mischievous humor in the rasping whisper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is wearing a red jump suit , tan Western boots and a white cap ; and a small tape recorder is playing excerpts of a freshly made Columbia Records release , his latest work with a group of young sidemen he plans to take on a concert tour after the performance at Lincoln Center. // " To me , it ' s old . I can ' t stand it , " Mr. Davis says of the music on the recording . His visitors include two women friends and Teo Macero , his record producer at Columbia Records . A Juilliard-trained composer and saxophonist , Mr. Macero has worked closely with Mr. Davis on nearly 30 different recordings since the artist first signed with the company in the 1950 ' s for a reported annual fee of $300 , 000. // Mr. Davis explains that a variety of debilitating physical ailments , including a throat condition which necessitated several operations , and trouble with a hip which called for additional surgery , had caused him to stop performing five years ago. // " When I laid off , I wasn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpeter says with his characteristic disdain for the past . " I gave music a break because I didn ' t feel like it . " Though Mr. Davis does not dwell on his ailments , family members say he underwent surgery for removal of gallstones , for the treatment of a stomach ulcer and for a leg infection. // " Miles is not one to detail his suffering , " says George Wein , producer of the Kool festival and a veteran jazz pipital bedside , " but you could see the agony on his face. " // On one occasion , Mr. Davis says , Mr. Wein made him a gift of $10 , 000 . " I asked , ' What ' s this for ? ' and George told me , ' You might need it for cigarette money. " // " Santana gave me this , " says Mr. Davis , proudly displaying a gold St. Christopher medal presented to him by the bandleader during his hospitalization . He then explains he wanted to refuse it , just out of graciousness , but a musician friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Wein says that after Mr. Davis ' s release from the hospital he occasionally visited and played tapes of his trumpet work , but apparently , for a time , without the old brilliance . " Then one day he played something that gave me that old case of gooseflesh . I didn ' t want to push him . I waited for him to say when. " // Mr. Wein says Mr. Davis waited until after the news conference announcing the talent lineup for the festival , then brought up how much money he ought to get for an appearance . Mr. Davis maintains he was promised $90 , 000 for two performances , a figure one knowledgeable observer said is not " unheard " of . But Mr. Wein denied the offer was actually that high . " I love Miles , we have a love-hate relationship , " says Mr. Wein , " but I will not discuss the money issue except to say that $90 , 000 is not an accurate figure. " // According to Columbia Records spokesmen , nearly all of Mr. Davis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musician ' s popularity . Almost since his arrival on the New York music scene in 1945 , when he was first taken under the protective wing of Charlie " Yardbird " Parker , with whom he shared his first New York apartment , Mr. Davis has been a man of burgeoning influence in jazz , a term he never uses to describe his music. // " It ' s a nigger word , " the trumpeter says , explaining that he believes the term " jazz " is used to set aside and diminish the importance of a contribution to the world ' s music primarily identified with blacks . While some might argue with Mr. Davis over that notion , few , indeed , would question the importance of his own contributions - vast contributions - to the idiom that is described by Mr. Wein as " hard to overestimate. " // To John Hammond , the authoritative critic and jazz patron credited with the " discovery " of such greats as Bessie Smith and Louis " Satchmo " Armstrong , Mr. Davis is the only major performer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jazz music. // In his autobiography , a chronicle of music dating back to the early 1900 ' s , Mr. Hammond writes of the generation preceding Mr. Davis and the " cool " jazz school he is credited with founding : " The Boppers gave a nod to Lester Young , to Charlie Christian and other real innovators , without absorbing what they had to give . Instead of expanding the form , they contracted it , made it their private language . I extend this critical judgment even to such giants as Bird Parker , Thelonious Monk and John Coltrane , " Mr. Hammond wrote . " The superlative Miles Davis is exempted. " // Ralph Gleason , another prominent critic , wrote that the trumpeter has " played the role in his generation that Louis Armstrong played in his . " He has been the supreme influence within his peer group , reaching a " lay audience of greater proportion than any pure , undiluted jazz-for-its-own sake player. " // Musicians who have worked for Mr. Davis during his career comprise a " Who ' s Who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coltrane and Julian " Cannonball " Adderly , both of whom are deceased ; Sonny Rollins , George Coleman and Wayne Shorter , co-leader with Joe Zawinul of the group Weather Report. // Among his better known piano alumni are Keith Jarret , Herbie Hancock , Chic Corea , Red Garland and the late Bill Evans . Although Mr. Davis ' s impact on each was varied , it centered mostly on the expression of an emotional intensity in their music . He encouraged them to be individualistic , always under control but paradoxically spontaneous . Mr. Hancock says he remembers what Mr. Shorter related : " He told us he was the only bandleader who paid his personnel not to practice their solos at home so as to avoid the polish that makes even some improvised music sound boring . He always wanted it fresh. " // While Miles Davis ' s flamboyant personal style has had a strong effect on many jazz players , his chief influence has come from his approach to music . Miles Davis , in the words of Gil Evans , the arranger who collaborated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first man to change the sound of the trumpet since Louis Armstrong . " As early as the 1950 ' s , critics vied among themselves on his album liners and in magazine articles for the mots juste to describe the Davis sound. // Accordingly , it was said that Barry Ulanov , an editor of Metronome , the now defunct jazz periodical , insured a place for himself when he characterized the sound of Miles Davis as " the sound of a man walking on egg shells . " In answer to that description , the jazz writer Ira Gitler came up with his own quotable comment : " Miles may be a man walking on eggshells , " Mr. Gitler wrote in attempting to capture the essence of Mr. Davis ' s playing , " but he is also a diamond cutting into opaque glass. " // By the late 1950 ' s and early 1960 ' s , when Mr. Davis ' s sound had reached maturity , the musician could bring his listeners to the verge of tears , wrenching the most melancholy qualities from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register of the horn where , as the critics noted , his technical prowess was strongest , Mr. Davis played with an emphasis on lyrical voice-like simplicity . To many , he seemed to streamline the more complicated earlier approach of his mentors - Mr. Parker and Dizzy Gillespie - who was still considered the reigning master of trumpet technique. // To worshipful fans , from Hollywood to Antibes , the sound of Mr. Davis became the perfect signature for his personality , the style and substance of the new archetypical man of jazz . The trumpeter added a quality of elegance to " Bird ' s " image of raw authenticity , and it was embodied in the sound that fit him as perfectly as his finely tailored clothes that caught the eye of Esquire and Gentleman ' s Quarterly magazines , which chose Mr. Davis as one of the nation ' s 10 best dressed men . There were are other notably contrasting features between Mr. Davis and the older Mr. Gillespie that illustrate attitudinal differences as much as differences in their ideas about music. // While much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dazzling technique - a charateristic feature of the be-bop school , in which musicians sometimes employed comic antics that established a warm personal rapport with the audiences they entertained , Mr. Davis and his younger followers never made an effort to entertain his listeners and has been roundly criticized by reviewers for sometimes turning his back during a performance or walking off stage or refusing to smile or to announce his personnel or the selections they play . Among his peers , his attitude of casually shrugging off his critics is just as much the substance of " cool " as the sound of his horn . " I ' m not being vain or anything , but that ' s the way I am , " says Mr. Davis . " I play for myself and I play for musicians. " // Mr. Davis says people he doesn ' t know approach him on the streets with an easy familiarity he finds offensive . Mimicking the exchange , Mr. Davis relates the following : " I drive a $56 , 000 car , " a yellow Ferrari , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ' m crazy . You must be an entertainer . I say no , " says Mr. Davis , with a wide-eyed glare , " Are you Miles Davis ? " " No , " he says he answers , " I ' m a janitor. " // Miles Dewey Davis 3d is the son of a dental surgeon who raised champion pedigreed pigs as a hobby . His mother was a music teacher in East St. Louis , Ill. , where the family moved shortly after Miles was born in Alton , Ill . According to his sister , Dorothy Wilburn , a teacher in the Chicago public schools , Miles was always independent , but especially so because the family , which included Miles , herself , and their brother , Vernon , was financially comfortable . Unlike many black musicians of his generation , he could " turn his back on people he didn ' t like and did so frequently whenever he sensed a racial snub . He always spoke his mind , " she added. // Though his father wanted Miles to pursue a career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the age of 12 , " Miles picked up a trumpet " and that was it . " Upon his graduation from the all-black Lincoln High School , Mr. Davis set out for New York City , accepting an invitation from Mr. Parker and Mr. Gillespie , whom he met when they passed through town. // At his mother ' s insistence , Mr. Davis enrolled in Juilliard , but his real music education began in the nightclubs , then the thriving centers along 52d Street for a new music called " be-bop. " // " Up at Juilliard , " Mr. Davis says , " I played in the symphony , two notes , ' bop-bop , ' every 90 bars , so I said let me out of here and then I left. " // In a career whose development is well documented on records , Mr. Davis first went into the studio with the tenor saxophonist Coleman Hawkins who , he says , hired him to listen for mistakes in bands for which the saxophonist wrote parts . Mr. Davis says Mr. Hawkins also looked after his money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would buy a coat for $300 and sell it to me for $15 , " he says . During this period Mr. Davis worked in the bands of Benny Carter and Billy Eckstein , and later with Mr. Parker. // Sometime during the late 1940 ' s Mr. Davis succumbed to heroin addiction , which initiated a gradual period of physical decline , finally forcing his absence from the music scene by the early 1950 ' s . Mrs. Wilburn says the addiction came as a bitter shock to the family , " and up to this very day , none of us discuss it publicly. " // Hired by producer George Wein in the summer of 1954 , however , Mr. Davis made a smashing return with a quintet featuring John Coltrane , then an unknown. // By the end of the decade , Mr. Davis had once again become bored with his music and , perhaps , with his personal life . A nine-year marriage to the former Frances Taylor was on the rocks . The trumpeter has three children born of an earlier relationship - Miles , Gregory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty Davis , was of brief duration. // Exceptionally busy during the 1960 ' s with a band the record industry categorized as a jazz group , Mr. Davis had begun to push against the boundaries of that designation . By the spring of 1970 , the trumpeter ' s biggest-selling release , " Bitches Brew , " signaled his success in extending jazz to a new realm. // The album sold 500 , 000 copies , which was considered a " phenomenal success " at Columbia Records . While rock groups sold larger numbers of albums , Mr. Davis ' s achievement was regarded as particularly noteworthy , considering he was an artist so deeply associated with jazz. // From an artistic standpoint , the album initiated what is still a controversial and not always successful effort among a legion of younger musicians to blend elements of rock with those of jazz . To a band that included the bassist Ron Carter , pianist Chic Corea , the saxophonist Wayne Shorter and the drummer Jack deJohnette , Mr. Davis added the fiery Brazilian percussionist Airto Moreira and John McLaughlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all for sound then amplified the results against a volatile hotbed of tribal rhythms . Though Mr. Davis alienated many of his old fans , he was not concerned . The older fans he had replaced with a younger , record-buying public. // In the words of the musicologist Michael Budds , what the trumpeter did was find a " solution to the integration of rock features in jazz ( that ) included the adoption of electronic instruments and devices , the underlying presence of complex multilayered rhythmic ostinatos , solo improvisation as well as group interaction and use of modal scales . The single most constructive achievement , " he said , " is devising a system in which rhythmic structure would not be locked into literal repetition of rhythmic patterns. . . " // Mr. Davis says he has no interest in such music today . " My ideas about music have changed , " he says . " I only listen to Stockhausen . " New York is great . I ' ve got so much noise . Subways . Horns . I can ' t stand nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own creative gifts in music , Mr. Davis says they are best described as a curse. // " I can ' t stop once I start thinking about it , " he says , rapping his knuckles on his circular coffee table in an unrelenting beat . " My mind is like this . I can ' t sleep for three days , four days at a time. " // Was there ever a time during his absence when he thought he would lose his ability to play ? " It doesn ' t go like that with me , " the trumpeter says . " I never think about not being able to do anything . I just pick up my horn and play the hell out of it.
