The public anxiety , even hysteria , touched off by AIDS is understandable , if lamentable . The disease was identified just over four years ago , and much about the ways in which it spreads remains obscure . No one knows , for example , why it strikes women and men in about equal numbers in Central Africa , where the disease appears to have originated , while in the U.S. only about 7% of the 13,000 victims identified so far have been women . There are theories but no proof . Nonetheless , a review of the facts establishes that public fears are vastly overblown . The ways in which AIDS is known to have been transmitted in the U.S. are few . <P> The AIDS virus , designated HTLV-III/LAV , has been detected in four bodily fluids : semen , blood , saliva and tears . But it has been found in saliva and tears only in small amounts , and not a single case of transmission by those fluids has been documented . Doctors can not prove that this will never happen , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood of an AIDS victim . Quite direct contact too : the virus can live only a very short time outside the human body . It does not linger on doorknobs , clothing , food , dishes , glasses , utensils or toilet seats . <P> Thus there has been no known case of infection by so-called casual contact : being in the same room with an AIDS victim , sharing a meal or a bathroom , being sneezed on , even hugging and social kissing . Members of families who have lived in intimate non-sexual contact with AIDS victims for many years have yet to produce a single documented case of the disease . No doctor , nurse , dental technician or other " health-care provider , " to use the medical jargon , in the U.S. is known to have picked up AIDS from a patient . ( A nurse in Britain who contracted the disease was accidentally pricked with a contaminated needle . ) In fact , there are only four ways in which the disease is known to be transmitted : <P> 1 ) By transfusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 10% of women with AIDS were infected in this way , and the numbers are likely + to dwindle . All blood donated for transfusions is now being subjected to a test to detect exposure to the virus . <P> 2 ) By sharing of needles among people who inject drugs into their bodies intravenously . An AIDS victim passes a needle to another drug abuser who uses it immediately ; blood on the needle enters the second narcotics user 's vein . Some 14% of the men and 53% of the much smaller number of women who have contracted AIDS in the U.S. got it this way . <P> 3 ) By childbirth . A baby can be infected with AIDS in the womb or during birth , probably from the mother 's blood . The number of cases so far is very small , about 130 ( some 180 children in the U.S. have the disease ) , but unhappily it is likely to increase . More parents are sure to be exposed to the virus , and a possibly large percentage , who for some unknown reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children . ( Both women and men who are not victims of AIDS can be carriers . ) <P> 4 ) By sexual intercourse . This is far and away the leading method of transmission , and to explain why requires being explicit ; too often the mechanisms have been obscured by ambiguous phrases like " exchange of bodily fluids " that may frighten more people than they inform .
