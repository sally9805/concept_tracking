Even when Hector Tabarez , 25 , keeps the windows rolled up as he drives his 1985 chocolate brown Nissan pickup , his reputation precedes him . Anyone within a several-block radius can hear Tabarez coming , for he drives what is known as a " boom car . " The auto mechanic from Gardena , Calif. , spent $8,000 to install the vehicle 's current stereo system , which comprises a deluxe Alpine 7902 compact-disc player , two heavy-duty Orion amplifiers and 32 speakers . His rig can deliver a bone-jarring 144 decibels of sound . " I just got carried away , " he admits . <P> Tabarez is not booming alone . Across the U.S. , thousands of young , mostly male , boom-car aficionados are ripping out their backseats and dashboards to make room for stereo equipment as advanced as audiophiles have at home . Says Danny Moore of East Orange , N.J. : " Girls all want to go out with the guy with the loudest car . " Besides rattling neighborhoods , boom-car fever has created a thriving market for manufacturers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japanese companies as Sony and Nakamichi but also specialized U.S. firms like Mitek of Winslow , Ill . <P> The manufacturers promote their products at crank-it-up contests that rival drag racing as the hot rodders ' sport of choice . Contestants pit their sonically souped-up cars against one another for cash , trophies and recognition . Last summer in Laredo , Texas , Tom Fichter of Houston broke the world 's record when his $27,000 system pounded out Flashdance . . . What a Feeling at 154.7 decibels , more than twice as loud as the sound of a jet taking off . <P> How much power can a guy buy for about $25,000 ? Tim Lublin of Hollywood , Fla. , who spent that much on the gear in his Chevy pickup , needs five twelve- volt batteries , hidden behind the front seat , to supply juice for his 3,000-watt system . The platform holding his five amplifiers folds on piano hinges to reveal a subfloor that carries four fans to cool the amps . <P> Boom-car buffs emphasize that they use the latest digital technology to achieve quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an art form to manage a car interior sonically , " says Steve Seidl , who outfits boom cars at Speaker Warehouse in Hollywood , Fla . " We use a spectrum analyzer to measure the ' pink noise ' in the car or to focus the sound on the driver . " <P> Not everyone shares the boomers ' enthusiasm . According to A.N . Norman , assistant bureau commander of the Los Angeles fire department , several city ambulance drivers have been involved in accidents with boom cars that did not yield the right of way . At a relatively puny 120 decibels , emergency sirens fail to cut through the din . <P> Moreover , doctors warn that even brief exposure to noise levels greater than 115 decibels can result in permanent hearing damage . But boomers turn a deaf ear to such objections . With one sound-off rally scheduled for Austin in two weeks and another on Easter Sunday in Daytona Beach , Fla. , the air will soon be filled with the sound of cars going boom in the night .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
