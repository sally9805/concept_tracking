While world financial markets reacted nervously to the outbreak of war between Iran and Iraq last week , a new book that promised to be a survival manual for economic disaster was riding atop the bestseller lists . Its title : Crisis Investing : Opportunities and Profits in the Coming Great Depression ( Stratford Press ; $12.50 ) . The book has already sold approximately 150,000 copies and turned its author , Douglas R. Casey , 34 , into the newest high priest of financial gloom and doom . <P> The message of Crisis Investing is simple . A depression of unprecedented magnitude will hit the world by 1983 because of excessive controls and distortions in the economy created by the U.S. Government . Says Casey : " This depression is going to make the 1930s look like a technical correction . This one is going to be a real doozy . " <P> Casey 's investment advice consists of some old bromides with a few new twists . In last year 's bestselling How to Prosper During the Coming Bad Years , Howard J. Ruff suggested that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented about the best investment people could make . Casey , a gold bug , advises selling everything at hand and putting up to half the proceeds into " a well-hidden hoard . " He likes bullion the best , but he also favors some gold mine stocks and South African Krugerrands . He confidently predicts that gold will eventually hit at least $1,600 per oz. , but fails to say when . That kind of open-ended prognostication is all but worthless . <P> Casey also believes that the stocks of small natural-resource companies are good for short-term speculation . He has a dim view of the current craze for buying such collectibles as artworks or beer cans . But he makes two exceptions : custom-made knives and antique Greek , Roman and medieval coins . Casey happens to collect both of these himself . He inveighs against investing in U.S. real estate , arguing that the market has already peaked . He advises people to rent , rather than buy , housing . One of Casey 's most urgent suggestions : get your money out of the U.S. and into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses of the Swiss banks he favors . <P> Douglas Casey is a self-described millionaire who claims RALPH MORSE he made his money by investing primarily in gold , oil and natural-resources stocks . He has also worked in Washington as an independent insurance agent and a stockbroker . He says the inspiration for the book came from " those nincompoops who masquerade as economists and obfuscate economics by making it unintelligible . " <P> Though the analysis and advice in Crisis Investing is often silly and sophomoric , its promotion has been shrewd . With an advertising budget of more than $600,000 , the book has been ballyhooed in a barrage of full-page newspaper ads , some of which proclaim in big headlines : " Why You Will Probably Lose Everything in the Coming Depression . " Casey is embarking on a lecture tour and starting a $ 145-a-year investment newsletter based on the book . On the way to the economic apocalypse , he will most likely make a bundle .                   @ @
