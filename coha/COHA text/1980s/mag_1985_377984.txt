For decade after decade Procter &; Gamble , the household-products giant , has never failed to show financial results as bright as the clothes in its detergent ads . But when the Cincinnati-based company hung out its latest profit statement last week , there was dirty laundry on the line . P &; G had suffered its first annual earnings decline since 1952 , posting fiscal 1985 profits of $635 million , down 29% from the previous year . <P> The traditionally aggressive P &; G is paying the price for a spell of complacency during which hardworking competitors scrubbed away at the dominance of its flagship brands . Crest 's share of the toothpaste business fell from 40% in 1977 to a current 29% , partly because P &; G was slow to introduce the popular new pump containers . The market share of Pampers disposable diapers fell from 55% to 29% in the past five years . One reason : heightened competition from Kimberly-Clark 's formfitting Huggies brand . <P> Hoping to emerge from its painful spin cycle , P &; G has embarked on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . The company is laying out $500 million to retool its Pampers plants for production of diapers that are more leak resistant . To meet rising demand for bottled detergents , P &; G introduced a liquid version of its top-selling Tide last November with a reported $50 million promotion campaign . The heavy spending , though , has aggravated P &; G 's profit woes . <P> P &; G has had some victories on the new-product front . Its low-priced Ivory brand shampoo , which debuted last year , quickly snared an excellent 8% of the market . But several of P &; G 's promising new brands have been disappointments . Citrus Hill orange juice has gone flat despite its fast start and heavy advertising . P &; G 's hopes for a big hit with Duncan Hines cookies ( crispy outside , chewy inside ) crumbled because the company failed to gear up its baking capacity quickly enough to meet competition from other new brands , including Nabisco 's Almost Home and Frito Lay 's Grand-Ma 's . Encaprin , P &; G 's aspirin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ibuprofen-based painkillers such as Advil and Nuprin . <P> P &; G officials are confident that their earnings setback is only temporary , and Wall Street seems to agree . The company 's stock was relatively stable last week , closing at 57 3/8 , down 3/8 . Perhaps investors are more impressed by 33 years of rising profits than one uncharacteristic dip .
