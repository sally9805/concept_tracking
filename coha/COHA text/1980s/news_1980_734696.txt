txt IF YOU HAVE N'T tried tofu yet , you should . You 've got a treat in store for you . Yesterday I met Mr. Tofu himself , Bill Shurtleff , and his Japanese wife , Akiko Aoyagi . Bill has written the definitive book on tofu , " The Book of Tofu , " which is now available in paperback ( Ballantine , $2.95 ) . It first came out about five years ago and sold 5,000 copies in two weeks . Then word spread . To date , a quarter of a million copies have been sold . And interest in tofu is still growing . You now can buy it at most of the better supermarkets in addition to natural food stores and Oriental groceries , where it has always been available .

But what good is all this if your family wo n't eat it ? THIS IS WHERE Bill and Aklko Shurtleff come in . They have perfected hundreds of recipes using soybeans in really delicious ways . Since their first book , they have written at least three or four new books on the subject and currently are working on still another ? " Soyfoods . " What they have to say is really very exciting .
