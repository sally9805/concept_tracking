<P> Mr. Mulroney goes to Ottawa <P> The occasion was important enough for Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau to interrupt his official tour of Greece last week and make a statement . Almost 5,000 miles away , fellow Quebecker Brian Mulroney , 44 , a bilingual businessman who became leader of the opposition Progressive Conservative Party in June , had just won his first seat in the House of Commons . Mulroney had thus positioned himself to run for Prime Minister in Canada 's next federal elections . Graciously calling Mulroney " a formidable opponent , " Trudeau , 63 , declared : " We will certainly be treating him with respect-and apprehension . " <P> Trudeau 's confidence could not conceal the deepening malaise within his Liberal Party . Mulroney 's rise to the Conservative leadership , combined with widespread public dissatisfaction over Trudeau 's 15-year tenure in Ottawa , has given the Tories an unprecedented 55%-to-27% edge over the Liberals in recent polls . Says former Conservative Deputy Prime Minister Walter Baker : " We smell power . " <P> Reversing the usual path of Canadian politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without ever having won elective office . Because a Prime Minister must be a Member of Parliament , a Tory M.P . from rural Nova Scotia obligingly quit his seat , precipitating a by-election . Immediately announcing his candidacy , Mulroney moved his family from Montreal into a three-bedroom log cabin in Northumberland Strait , Nova Scotia , and forswore his Gucci shoes and expensive suits for moccasins and old sweaters . He stuck close to matters of local concern , such as improving harbors and providing financial aid for fishermen , and cannily refused to be drawn into defining his stance on national issues . That was not enough to stave off noisy charges that Mulroney was a " cottager , " or outsider . Nonetheless , his easy manner quickly won the admiration of crusty Nova Scotians . Mulroney trounced his closest rival in last week 's by-election , 18,882 to 7,828 . <P> The son of an English-speaking electrician from the Quebec mining town of Baie Comeau , Mulroney was a labor negotiator before becoming president of the U.S.-owned Iron Ore Company of Canada . He insists that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elections , as he must by February 1985 . Generally , Mulroney favors increased defense expenditures , incentives to businessmen and investors , and the maintenance of major social programs . But he is also committed to a balanced federal budget and reduced government spending . He has yet to explain how he intends to reconcile these contradictory objectives . " Certainly there will be restraint , but spending cuts will be fairly modest , " he says . " We are not Britain . We are not the U.S. "
