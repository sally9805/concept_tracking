Judge Robert Bork , the fire-breathing right-wing ideologue who would wreak havoc on U.S. law , did not show up at the Senate Caucus Room last week . Neither did Robert Bork , the quick-witted charmer , " the bearded Ollie North , " who would obliterate his opposition . The 14 members of the Senate Judiciary Committee met a different Robert Bork last week , one who did not quite fit the images drawn by either his liberal critics or his conservative boosters . <P> Through five days of testimony , Bork portrayed himself as a questing thinker who had mellowed with time . In the process , he modified or danced away from several of his well-documented , iconoclastic views on key legal issues ranging from freedom of speech to sex discrimination . To explain his evolving ideas , he quoted Benjamin Franklin : " The older I grow , the more apt I am to doubt my own judgment and to pay more respect to the judgment of others . " <P> Several Senators on the panel did not take such a sanguine view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawmakers were concerned that Bork was too rigid in his conservative ideology . During the judge 's testimony , they wondered aloud if he was , instead , too changeable . " What troubles me is the very significant and profound shifts , " said Pennsylvania Republican Arlen Specter , who has remained undecided . " Where 's the predictability in Judge Bork ? " Vermont Democrat Patrick Leahy fired a more serious charge at the witness . Accusing Bork of mendaciously softening his ( views to ensure Senate approval , Leahy called the judge 's changes of opinion a case of " confirmation conversion . " <P> By trimming his sails , Bork left his liberal critics scurrying to revise their tactics . Said Nan Aron , director of the Alliance for Justice : " He 's not coming across as a cool , intellectual thinker but as someone who changes his mind according to which way the wind is blowing . " The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights produced a seven-page analysis called Bork v. Bork that declared , " What the New Judge Bork now says differs significantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of sex , privacy and contraception . " <P> Bork 's supporters generally felt that he helped his case by coming across as open to change . Contended Bruce Fein , a legal scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation : " Open-minded people frequently change their minds . Constitutional jurisprudence is not first-grade arithmetic . " <P> One of his most notable changes involves free speech . In a 1971 Indiana Law Journal article , Bork argued that " constitutional protection should be accorded only to speech that is explicitly political . " He also challenged as " fundamentally wrong " the court 's 1969 decision in Brandenburg v. Ohio , which held that speech advocating violence can be restricted only when it is " directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action . "
