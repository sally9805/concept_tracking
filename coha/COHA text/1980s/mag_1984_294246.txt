James Brooks'Terms of Endearment wins five Oscars <P> Over the past decade and a half , James Brooks , 43 , has made a career out of writing and producing such unpredictable TV comedies as Taxi and Mary Tyler Moore . But last week , after winning three Oscars for Terms of Endearment , the first movie he ever directed , the normally pessimistic Brooks reacted in an uncharacteristically predictable way : he was ecstatic . " I 'm nuts , " he said . " I 'm programmed for about two minutes of joy , and this has been going on for 48 hours . " <P> His own statuettes were for best picture ( he co-produced Terms ) , best director and best screenplay adaptation , and two of his picture 's stars also came in first . Shirley MacLaine was named best actress for her role as Aurora Greenway , the film 's impossible but ultimately likable mother , and Jack Nicholson was chosen best supporting actor for playing Aurora 's lecherous astronaut lover . The other major awards at the seemingly endless ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Robert Duvall won the best actor Oscar for his role as an alcoholic country singer in Tender Mercies ; Linda Hunt received the best supporting actress award for playing a male dwarf in The Year of Living Dangerously ; and Fanny and Alexander , the last major feature Ingmar Bergman has said he will ever direct , took the prize for best foreign picture . <P> The night , however , really belonged to Brooks . In a Hollywood story older than the Oscars themselves , he had been turned down by almost every studio in town before Paramount finally said yes , it would help him make a comedy in which one of the leading characters , Aurora 's daughter Emma ( Debra Winger ) , dies of cancer . " The script was always killed with kindness , " says Brooks . " People really liked it but perceived it as a small , dark , emotional comedy . I spent two years telling studio heads that it was n't a cancer picture . I hate cancer pictures . I do n't want to see a cancer picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that is that there are human beings in cancer wards . " <P> Brooks thought of his movie ( based on the novel by Larry McMurtry ) as not dark but very light comedy-humor arising not out of plot but out of the endless vagaries of the human character . " I always felt that if Terms of Endearment lives as a comedy , I would be proud . If not , I would be a little lost . " Trying to translate that kind of humor onto film was not easy however . Brooks tinkered endlessly with his script and added a new romance for Aurora , the Nicholson character who was not in McMurtry 's novel . Sometimes he made his actors go through half a dozen takes , with half a dozen different approaches , so that he could choose the version he wanted in the editing room . " Jim wanted his choice of different levels of comedy , " says Winger . " It got crazy at times . It was sometimes grueling to get it right . "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
