Almost lost in the debate surrounding the three and a fourth , President Reagan ' s original budget , is the virtual certainty that with whichever plan is enacted Mr. Reagan will obtain at least 75 percent of the reductions he wants in budget proposals for the fiscal year 1982 , which begins in October. // One of the three Congressional budget proposals , the plan of Representatives Delbert L. Latta , Republican of Ohio , and Phil Gramm , Democrat of Texas , totally accepts the President ' s economic assumptions and hews closely to his budget. // The second , by the Senate Budget Committee , accepts most , but not all , of the President ' s economic assumptions and his budget priorities. // // Economic Projections Differ // The third , by the House Budget Committee , has revised most of the President ' s economic assumptions and shifted priorities to put greater emphasis on social programs at the expense of military spending. // All the budgets , though based on different projections of inflation , unemployment and interest rates and adding up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a sluggish calendar year 1981 followed by an economic upturn and reduced inflation. // " We ' re talking about differences of degree , " said Alice Rivlin , director of the Congressional Budget Office , whose economic projections are usually less optimistic than those of the White House. // But those differences in degree , while relatively small , can translate into billions of dollars in projected deficits . <> <> Reagan Popularity Reported High // And customarily , they have been resolved not by the merits of economic arguments but by the respective power of the combatants in the political arena. // Members of Congress who returned today from a two-week Easter recess reported that President Reagan ' s popularity was extraordinarily high . " I can read Congresses and I can read legislators and they go along with the will of the people , and the will of the people is to go along with the President , " Speaker Thomas P. O ' Neill Jr. told reporters. // Mr. Reagan spent much of the Easter recess wooing 40 conservative Democrats who are seen as the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O ' Neill acknowledged today that the President ' s campaign " had a tremendous impact . " And tomorrow , in his first major public appearance since the assassination attempt March 30 , the President plans to address a joint session of Congress to muster support for his plan to revitalize the economy by cutting taxes and Government expenditures . <> <> The Reagan Figures // The Administration made these economic assumptions in preparing its budget : that the inflation rate would decline 10 to 11 percent in the fiscal year 1981 to 8. 3 percent in 1982 ; that the unemployment rate would decline from 7. 8 percent to 7. 2 percent , and that the interest rate on 91-day Treasury bills would decline from 11. 1 percent to 8. 9 percent. // The President ' s budget for the fiscal year 1982 proposed outlays of $695. 5 billion , military spending of $188. 8 billion , a 25 percent reduction in the projected growth rate of most social programs , and a deficit of $45 billion . In calculating revenues , the President ' s budget assumes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The President ' s assumptions were accepted in the budget proposed by Representatives Latta and Gramm . But the two cut social programs $6 billion more than the Administration had , and came up with a $689 billion budget that had the same $188. 8 billion for military spending but a $38. 9 billion deficit. // Next closest to the President ' s proposed budget is one that is expected to be adopted by the Senate Budget Committee . The committee accepted all the President ' s economic and tax assumptions except the one concerning the interest rate on 91-day Treasury bills . Instead of the 8. 9 percent interest rate projected by the Administration , the Senate Budget Committee projected a 12 percent rate in the fiscal year 1982 , which would increase the Government ' s cost of borrowing money by billions of dollars. // Based on those assumptions , the Senate Budget Committee is expected to approve a $704 billion budget , with $194 billion for military spending and a $53. 8 billion deficit . <> <> The House Panel ' s Budget // The greatest departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House Budget Committee , which disputed most of the Administration ' s economic assumptions and reduced the growth rate of social programs by 10 percent instead of the 25 percent recommended by the Administration. // The House committee projected an inflation rate of 9. 2 to 10. 4 percent , as against the 8. 3 percent rate projected by the Administration . The committee projected an unemployment rate of 7. 3 percent , only one-tenth of a percent higher than the Administration ' s projection , but agreed with the Senate Budget Committee in projecting an interest rate of 12 percent. // The House Committee approved a budget of $714. 5 billion , including $189. 7 million for military spending and a deficit of $25. 6 billion . Unlike the other budgets , the committee did not accommodate the President ' s entire tax plan , but only $38 billion of the $53 billion in revenue loss projected by the Administration for the next fiscal year. // Social programs were the big winners in the House Budget Committee proposal . The committee proposed $4. 4 billion more than the Administration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and similar programs , and $1 billion more for transportation and health. // The Democratic-controlled House will provide the greatest test of the President ' s proposed budget . Action on the House floor , which is scheduled this week , could well prove decisive in determining which economic assumptions and which budget priorities will prevail in the fiscal year 1982. //
