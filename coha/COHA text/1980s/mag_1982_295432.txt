HUD stares , Chicago blinks <P> Late last month Chicago Mayor Jane Byrne was boasting that on the first anniversary of her ballyhooed three-week stay in the crime-ridden Cabrini-Green public housing project , " it has been turned around . It 's not perfect , but it 's better . " But Her Honor 's moment of glory was clouded . Since January she and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development had been feuding over a HUD audit suggesting that the Chicago Housing Authority , the nation 's second largest , with 142,000 tenants in 46,000 units , was among the worst managed . " It is almost as if the CHA exists for a purpose other than the management and maintenance of good quality public housing , " the report charged . Its true purpose ? " The acquisition of as many Federal Government dollars as possible for the creation of patronage jobs and financial opportunities . " <P> Compared with New York City , which has 525,000 people in 170,000 units , Chicago had runaway deficits ( $42 per unit per month , vs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies ( $131 vs. $112 ) . The study found that costs for heating , elevator repairs and garbage disposal were excessive , and that $50 million in modernization funds was sitting in local bank accounts earning low interest . HUD Under Secretary Donald Hovde demanded the resignation of all five CHA commissioners , including the chairman , powerful Realtor Charles Swibel , one of the mayor 's closest allies . Swibel , 55 , was appointed to the board in 1956 by Mayor Richard Daley . Chicago Political Analyst Don Rose describes him as " a do-fer . As in ' What can I do fer you ? ' " <P> When Byrne did not act , HUD froze $14.5 million in subsidies . The mayor retaliated by taking out $35,000 worth of newspaper ads describing HUD 's charges as a smokescreen for " inadequate funding for public housing . " Swibel held firm , refusing to resign at a raucous CHA meeting early last week . " I 'm staying because I 've done nothing wrong , " he insisted shortly before being hospitalized with an apparent ulcer attack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up for re-election in 1983 , announced that she would seek to expand the CHA board to seven members and make the chairman a full-time professional . She privately assured Hovde that Swibel would be out " within 90 days , " and HUD then lifted the freeze on funds . Swibel 's departure will bring no sudden changes in public housing . Still , editorialized the Chicago Sun-Times , " any scheme that would remove the inept Charles R. Swibel as chairman of the Chicago Housing Authority ca n't be all bad . "
