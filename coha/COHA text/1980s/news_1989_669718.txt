Perhaps growing from an interest in all things Australian - an interest fueled by last year ' s Aussie bicentennial , two ' ' Crocodile Dundee ' ' films , and such bestselling novels from down under as Robert Hughes ' s ' ' Fatal Shore ' ' - new excitement has been generated by the exhibition and sale in the United States of Aboriginal art. // The dot-and-circle symbol system used in many of the Aboriginal paintings - whether acrylics on canvas or traditional bark paintings bark - embraces 40 , 000 years of mythology , history , religion , and social customs . Aboriginal painting represents the the oldest continuous visual-art tradition on Earth , dating back to twice the age of the cave paintings in Lascaux , France. // The added dimension of an abstract imagery that is aesthetically compelling but also sacred - even secret - has piqued interest among buyers and viewers , alike , who are attracted to deeper ideas of what art is about. // // ' ' This is a way to look at the very dawn of art - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context as a sort of proto-hieroglyphics , ' ' says Richard Kelton , a Los Angeles collector whose nearly 80 pieces add up to the largest private collection in this countryt . Mr. Kelton has helped organize two major shows here since 1980 and has taught courses on Aborignal art . ' ' You can begin to learn about what art was at its very genesis , ' ' he adds. // Page Matheson , a student at the University of Chicago , where the nation ' s first major national tour of Aboriginal art attracted viewers who knew little about Aboriginal culture , says , ' ' I am drawn to the strong social and symbolic role that makes their art function differently than ours in the Western world. ' ' // Nancy Munn , an Aboriginal expert at the University of Chicago , says , ' ' This is the first time most Americans have had a chance to witness this vast tradition.

One ' ' sand painting ' ' recently sold for $150 , 000 in New York . Other collectors are waiting until the market impact of Aboriginal paitings can be more fully analyzed. // But evidence that interest has skyrocketed comes from many directions. // The first , large-scale Aboriginal art show to tour the US , an exhibition entitled ' ' Dreamings , ' ' attracted the largest audience in the 30-year history of the Asia Society Gallery in New York . Crowds at the exhibition ' s Chicago stop made it the top show in 15 years there , according to Jeff Abt , director of the Smart Gallery. // Other short-term exhibits of Aboriginal art are popping up in cities from New York to San Francisco and Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminars has incidated passionate interest in the subject , say museum officials. // ' ' Consciousness is being raised and education begun , ' ' says Kate Flynn , an Australian collector and dealer living in New York . Ms. Flynn is trying to get financial backing for an all-Aboriginal gallery there . She mentions two recent month-long exhibitions that attracted a lot of interest . A third is now underway at the John Weber Gallery in Soho. // ' ' Americans have just discovered the appeal of Aboriginal art , and demand for it is so phenomenal I can ' t believe it , ' ' says Dorothy Bennett , an Australian who has spent the last 30 years collecting Aboriginal art and trying to generate interest in it among the public . She also wants to interest Aborigines in preserving their traditional art forms so they don ' t die out as the artists dwindle. // Of the 100 , 000 Aborigines still living in Australia , some 35 to 50 are considered topnotch artists . Another 100 or so have developed an interest in art and are developing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the modern acrylic medium is not in danger of disappearing , she and others say , the older tradition of bark painting could . Over the last decade , the number of practicing bark painters has declined from 35 to seven , according to Ms. Bennett . ' ' The young are not interested in carrying on the tradition , ' ' she laments. // Aboriginal art ' ' raises painful questions about the irreversible drainage from our own culture of spirituality , awe , and connection to nature , ' ' wrote Time magazine ' s Robert Hughes in a review of ' ' Dreamings . ' ' ' ' Tribal art is never free and does not want to be . The ancestors do not give one drop of guinea spit for ' creativity . ' ' ' It is the special meanings and ceremonial uses associated with Aboriginal art that has caused something of a flutter in its buying and selling. // ' ' Art patrons are uncomfortable with having something on their wall they can ' t explain to their peers , ' ' says Gordon Marks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Aboriginal mode of painting is available , the precise symbolism is protected by tribal custom and law . With the recent upsurge in prices , there is increasing concern about the ' ' borrowing ' ' of tribal symbols and patterns. // ' ' The Aborigines are beginning to face questions of copyright infringement and how to make legal concepts stick , ' ' says Professor Fred Myers , an anthropologist at Columbia University. // Beginning in 1971 , some Aboriginal artists started painting on canvas rather than on rocks , bark , or sand so that their work could be preserved . That movement has gained momentum over the years . Gradually , too , a handful of collectors began to bring Aboriginal art to the attention of a wider public. // Now on view here in Los Angeles before embarking on an international tour , ' ' Dreamings ' ' is being coordinated with a companion exhibition of Aboriginal art at the city ' s Caz gallery . When it opened its doors last October , Caz was the only US gallery specializing in Aboriginal art . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Both Mr. Marks and Caz owner Carol Lopes note that the keen interest in Aboriginal art is tempered by some wariness and confusion. // ' ' There is a very steep learning curve , ' ' says Marks . ' ' A buyer will come back many times , first to ask questions about the various tribes and symbols , next to buy a book , then to attend a reception where others are interested . Many are already collectors of American and European art and wonder if this is the coming wave. ' ' // The wariness arises partly from the lack of a stable pricing system , a relative paucity of scholars who understand the symbolism of the paintings , and concern about the numbers of Aborigines willing to preserve and extend their artistic heritage. // ' ' The young are jumping into the act in droves , which means there will always be work to be had , ' ' predicts Lopes . ' ' But whether or not the really refined work of the elders will continue is not yet settled.

' ' Accumulating wealth doesn ' t mean anything to them . Yet there is something disturbing about the commercial aspect , if it gets too mindless. ' ' // Though the current exhibition has received generally high marks from critics , its reception in Los Angeles has been mixed. // ' ' I think the standing ovation for ' Dreamings ' is prompted less by reverence for Aboriginal societies than by a throbbing nostalgia for the modern West , ' ' wrote a critic in the Herald Examiner. // But whatever critics think of the art , there is no doubt that it has launched an educational process . The catalogue for the show has been called the best short introduction to the Aboriginal world view now in print. // ' ' Dreamings could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art , ' ' said the Los Angeles Times .
