tidings of a new , wonderful , larger-than-life // musical , the kind that provides a feast for the // eyes and a message of no import . Nice , but not yet possible . So if the year must start on a more serious vein , let it be with a play that celebrates the spirit of survival. // This one is " Tracers , " a production of the New York Shakespeare Festival/Vietnam Veterans Ensemble Theater Company , which , after meeting with critical acclaim in Los Angeles and Chicago , begins a four-week run at the Public Theater on Jan. 9 . " Tracers " grew out of an improvisation by a group of actors , all veterans of the Vietnam War , and it traces the real and imagined experiences of eight men who served in that war . The production is directed by John DiFusco , and the sound track is rock music from the 1960 ' s and 70 ' s , including the Doors and Crosby , Stills , Nash and Young. // // // Harvey Fierstein said he was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unemployed and rich than unemployed and poor , it got pretty boring feeding the dogs . Which is why the actor-playwright , who may soon be crowded out of his home by awards , is returning to " Torch Song Trilogy " Jan. 7 to resume his Tony-Award winning role of Arnold Beckoff . Mr. Fierstein , who also garnered a Tony for a musical , with his " Cage aux Folles , " made a similar repeat performance last January . This time , he ' ll remain in " Torch Song " which he also wrote , for seven weeks . Court Miller is also returning , to play the role of Ed , the lover. // " It ' s like going home , " Mr. Fierstein said . " I love that company. " // // // It ' s not fair to choke to death on moo shu pork in a Chinese restaurant . That ' s what Shirley thinks , and that ' s why she refuses to stay buried .

" He transforms himself into a Hasid with a squint , a stammer , a lump and a limp , which , for a nice- looking , perfectly healthy young man in his early 30 ' s , is no mean feat . " I ' ve taken to doing warm-up exercises before and after performances , " said Mr. Zagnit , who plays the title role in " Kuni- Leml . " " It ' s a demanding chore. " // It ' s particularly demanding because , as the actor explained , when the role was originally performed in the late 19th century , " Yiddish comics would add their own shtick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept using physical aspects as comedy . " The result is that although the physical characteristics are an integral part of the play , they are handled in a straightforward manner and the humor , he says , emanates from " a point of view. " // Another result is that Mr. Zagnit has developed a reverse kind of ego . He ' s not too pleased when he ' s recognized offstage . " It ' s a left-handed compliment , " he said . " It may mean that I ' m doing something wrong. " // Mr. Zagnit , who thinks he may be the only actor in New York who hasn ' t worked as a waiter ( he did sell magazine ads and deliver singing telegrams ) , has also lost a number of jobs in commercials because of the beard he ' s grown for " Kuni-Leml .

" // " You can lose a commercial because you ' re not the right height or you don ' t have the right look , " said Mr. Zagnit , who was brought up in Spotswood , N.J. , and decided to become a performer after watching Jerry Lewis movies . " In the theater , " he said , " you can cross all those barriers. " // // // We ' ve had one-man shows of Mark Twain , Harry S. Truman , Rudyard Kipling , Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe , but only Poe is going to be with us again starting tonight . Conrad Pomerleau wrote the script and also stars in " Poe in Person , " which will play an uneven schedule at the Apple Corps Theater Company ( 336 West 20th Street ) through Feb. 11 .

The more immediate production features John Scherer as Huck Finn , Todd Heughens as Tom Sawyer and Joe Lynn as Jim .
