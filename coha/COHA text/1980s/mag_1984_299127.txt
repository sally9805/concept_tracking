SCUMBLER by William Wharton Knopf ; 256 pages ; $14.95 <P> " Always distrust professed honesty , " says Scumbler , an aging , defiantly bohemian American painter in Paris . " It 's the ultimate con job . " This seems an odd assertion from a character whose narrative is one long profession of emotional candor , sensitivity , creativity and individuality . William Wharton 's novel is no con job , however , but something perhaps harder to take : a credo of total , devout and sometimes excruciating sincerity . <P> Scumbler 's name is borrowed from the technical term for texturing over one color with another ; usually he shortens it to Scum , for scum of the earth . A self-proclaimed people 's painter , he roams the streets on his battered motorcycle , white beard flying , paintbox strapped on his back , searching for subjects . He relishes getting caught up fitfully in the lives of the students , prostitutes , policemen and tourists who gather around his easel . He goes where the flow carries him , down to explore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans on an outing in Spain . His paintings , when he manages to sell any , fetch only a few hundred dollars , yet somehow he supports a wife and five children , two of whom attend stateside universities . He is , in fact , an intensely domestic creature , with a compulsion to refurbish old lofts and workshops as a series of " nests . " <P> Old Scum might seem more engaging and colorful if he were not so familiar : another in a long line of romantics who disdain the bourgeois " scramble for outside things like money or status , " a lesser descendant of that definitive rogue-genius Gulley Jimson , hero of Joyce Gary 's The Horse 's Mouth . For a man who claims that most of his life has been " a flight from boredom , " Scum has an amazing tolerance for bull-session profundities . Scarcely a page goes by without an interpolated haiku-like verse ( WE WEAR OURSELVES INSIDE OUT/ TRYING TO BRING THE OUTSIDE IN ) or an observation like " The truly most valuable product of this planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Wharton , author of Birdy , Dad and A Midnight Clear , is himself an American painter who lived many years in Paris , so it is no surprise that his street scenes and descriptions of the painterly process are vividly authentic . His chapter on Scum 's attempt to paint a self-portrait that would transport him out of the temporal dimension makes a stirring set piece . But his identification with his character is so complete that the novel seems to be spun from their shared fantasy fulfillment . Difficulties give way before Scum . Whatever he needs comes conveniently to hand , whether building materials , a rich art collector or a nubile girl to tempt his sagging libido . <P> " I think I hurt people by living , " Scum maintains . " My maniacal insistence on living my own life is in itself a terrible violation of everybody else . " The reader sees little of such conflict . Insofar as the other characters have any life outside of Scum 's ruminations , they are as simple and warm-hearted an assortment of waifs and eccentrics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Indeed , like Saroyan 's , Wharton 's writing has often seemed like a race between originality and sentimentality . In Scumbler , the sentimentality is way out in front . <P> - By Christopher Porterfield
