The first day Bella Davidovich sat down to practice the piano in her new apartment in Queens , N.Y. , a neighbor slipped a note under the door asking her not to play so loudly . Winner of the International Chopin Competition , faculty member at the Moscow Conservatory , Deserving Artist of the Soviet Union , Davidovich was unknown to her new neighbors . Her nonpolitical departure from the U.S.S.R. had occurred without benefit of an international incident and the subsequent career-boosting headlines . Adding injury to insult , Davidovich had been mugged just after her arrival in New York City ; unfamiliar with such American customs , she had resisted so fiercely that she required surgery to repair damage to her knees . <P> Today Davidovich , 56 , is recognized in her adopted country as a leading international pianist , acclaimed for her fluent , elegant interpretations of Schumann and Chopin . Unlike those Soviet emigres who left their homeland seeking greater personal freedom and artistic success , Davidovich came to the U.S. for only one reason : to be with her son , Violinist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1977 to study at the Juilliard School in New York . " My son is my life , " explains the quintessential Jewish mother , a widow since 1958 . " I could n't live without seeing him . " <P> When the Soviet concert agency Goskontsert , probably fearing her defection , canceled her scheduled tours of Italy and the Netherlands , Davidovich decided that she would have to join Dmitry . Together with her mother and sister , she painstakingly gathered the required emigration documents , including such arcana as the funeral certificate of her grandfather ; within six months all three were granted permission to leave . <P> She was able to take one rug , no furniture and no books or scores that predated 1946 ; family heirlooms had to be left behind . Forsaken too was the hard-won respect that the Soviets gave grudgingly to Jewish artists . " Jews are considered a lower echelon , " notes Davidovich , a gentle , gracious woman whose expressive face and eyes faithfully mirror her emotions . " I received my title of Deserving Artist five years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , everything , like playing in the West and teaching , happened with delays . " <P> In exchange she got New York City 's mean streets ( " a terrible sight , all that garbage " ) , its Augean subway ( " so loud and dirty " ) . Davidovich quickly fled to the apartment in Kew Gardens ( " quiet , with trees and a fresh smell " ) . Perhaps the hardest thing to bear was her professional anonymity , the necessity of starting a career over again . " It was very difficult , " remembers Davidovich , whose still limited command of English requires her to use an interpreter . " I was very famous in the Soviet Union . I had my public . I did not know if it would be good for me in the United States . "
