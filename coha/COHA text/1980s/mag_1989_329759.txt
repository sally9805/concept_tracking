It 's Sunday afternoon , and thousands of Japanese teenagers jam the narrow streets of Tokyo 's Harajuku district . They are in search of a life-style that can be bought , often dearly , in the dozens of stores crammed into the crowded area . Along Takeshita-dori , a narrow street in the heart of the district , are shops with curious names  --  Octopus Army , Short Kiss , Good Day House  --  that offer a variety of identities . There are button-down collars and plaid pants for the preppie look , floral prints and batiks for the Third World ethnic look , tennis and soccer equipment for the ultra-fit look . One store sells nothing but Batman gear for the Caped Crusader look . <P> For many Japanese teenagers , a look often has to suffice for a life-style . Japan may be a wealthy nation , but its young people remain restricted . The demands of a high-pressure educational system allow little time for relaxation and leave few opportunities to make a drastic change in life-style : to spend a summer at the beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youngsters move from fad to fad , called bumu ( Japanese for boom ) . Last year it was retro bumu , which elevated the bulky , prosperous look of the 1950s to a new art form . Italian casual , inspired by Benetton , had its moment . So did leather jackets and vests for the Hell 's Angels mode . And the prim little-girl look with button-up sweaters . <P> The more diversity of styles , the better . Still , when the youngsters get confused or the designers founder , the style that always seems to endure and prosper is Amekaji , as the kids call American casual . Says Tomohiro Ando , sales manager of Octopus Army : " American design remains the base . Amekaji is always such a comfortable and functional look . " The labels of Octopus Army shirts thoughtfully proclaim those virtues in the fractured English beloved by Japanese teens : " Best in the field of Spangled Stars , Americanized as hell as well as originality . " Exactly how that translates is not important ; it 's the feeling and verve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , American designers and manufacturers have rushed to cash in on Amekaji . Designers like Ralph Lauren prospered during the upscale preppie fad , or toraddo-bumu , but interest in the traditional look has recently faltered  --  though it will never die out because of the Japanese partiality for neat and tailored clothes . Interest in American sportswear is strong , and the California influence is evident everywhere . Last summer many teens were captivated by the surfer look , with shirts and shorts in neon lime and fluorescent orange . The University of California , Los Angeles , through its own licensees in Japan , sells annually some $16 million worth of T shirts , warm-up suits and jackets , all bold with the authentic UCLA logo . <P> Oshman 's , a Houston-based sporting-goods chain , has a shop in Harajuku that sells everything from $320 Eddie Bauer jackets to Hawaiian surfboards at $785 each . Only about 30% of Oshman 's goods are made in the U.S. , but the feeling in the store is as relentlessly American as Beach Boys music and suntan lotion .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
