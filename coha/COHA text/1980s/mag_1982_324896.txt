With sanctions and symbolic gestures , the West supports the Poles <P> The leaders of the Western world were preoccupied with a common question last week : How should they respond to the Polish government 's declaration of martial law and crackdown on the independent trade union movement Solidarity ? In a Christmas address to the American people , President Reagan proposed a number of economic sanctions against Poland and one sweeping , symbolic gesture of support . Recalling that the Polish people were demonstrating their opposition to martial law by placing lighted candles in their windows , the President declared he would light a candle in a White House window " as a small but certain beacon of our solidarity with the Polish people . " He asked Americans " to do the same , on Christmas Eve , as a personal statement of your commitment to the steps we are taking to support the brave people of Poland in their time of troubles .

The effect of these measures , the President hoped , would be to encourage the Polish government to bring a quick end to its state of emergency . Like Reagan , Western European leaders were concerned about the Polish crisis but deeply divided over how to deal with it . French President Francois Mitterrand was outraged over the repression in Poland and convinced that the Soviets were behind it . He disagreed , however , with Reagan 's view that Western governments should retaliate by suspending food shipments to Poland .
