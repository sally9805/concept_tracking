Neither as chic as Paris nor as intriguingly edgy as Budapest , the Vienna of today is a cozy and polished metropolis . But at the beginning of the 20th century , Vienna was chockablock with giants of the age : Freud and Wittgenstein , Mahler , Berg and Schoenberg , Klimt , Schiele , Kokoschka , Hoffmann , Wagner and Loos  --  as well as the young Adolf Hitler , a desperate artist-architect manque . Old cultural dogmas had been discredited , new doctrines not yet entrenched . Imminence was all . Artists and intellectuals all over Europe shared a sense of being on the very cusp  --  between a smug century and a mad one , between well-behaved traditionalism and liberated modernism  --  but nowhere was the sense more highly refined than in hothouse Vienna . Right now , on each side of the Atlantic , that singular , overwrought time and place is evoked in two remarkable museum shows . <P> In New York : Gemutlich Radicals <P> Until the last decade or so , turn-of-the-century Vienna was neglected by serious historians of architecture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architecture of Josef Hoffmann and Otto Wagner and the paintings of Gustav Klimt were camp curiosities at best  --  parochial , high-strung , dead-end digressions . Today , however , a kind of Viennese revival is under way . Prominent designers and architects are producing furniture and buildings distinctly reminiscent of Hoffmann , Wagner and Adolf Loos . Every second book jacket , it seems , has a thick , angular sans serif typeface derived from the Wiener Werkstatte , the seminal crafts collaborative established in the city in 1903 . Nearly the whole crop of high-design coffee services and teapots marketed since 1980 seems to have been plucked from an avant-garde Viennese workshop sometime before 1910 . <P> Now , with the opening of " Vienna 1900 : Art , Architecture and Design , " a dense display of objects at New York City 's Museum of Modern Art , the revised revisionism is official : the arts and crafts of early 20th century Vienna may have been idiosyncratic and lush , but they are products of the modern sensibility . MOMA 's entire ground floor has been given over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1898 and 1918 . The show , which derives from more expansive exhibits seen in Vienna and Paris over the past two years , will be on view until Oct. 21 . <P> In the eerie , gorgeous twilight between empire and dissolution , the city 's ; radical young artists and architects broke from the local academy , named themselves Secessionists and established their own countersalon in 1897 . They called their journal Ver Sacrum ( Sacred Spring ) and practiced , as a matter of principle , a manic cross-fertilization . With Klimt , art became overtly decorative , gold-inlaid portraits masquerading as rich bijoux ; with Hoffmann and his Wiener Werkstatte collaborator Koloman Moser , bowls and chairs aspired to art . It was a feverish , unresolved time , and the Viennese fin-de-siecle impulse was to savor the exquisitely confused cultural moment .
