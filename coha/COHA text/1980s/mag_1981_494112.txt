In the past 20 or 30 years we 've forgotten the distinction between " education " and " schooling " ; many people believe they are one and the same . We 've allowed school people to claim " education " as their territory , the same way that the Moral Majority acts as if it alone cares about morality and values . School professionals have stepped into the breach willingly , and have built a wall ( with bricks of jargon ) around the schools , keeping children in and parents out . Now there are signs that the wall is collapsing . It seems self-evident that children learn a great deal in places other than school , and yet the assumption " school equals education " governs much of our thinking . If it 's a device to allow parents to work or " do their own thing- without guilt , it 's an evasion . As I was writing this review , our 13-year-old son returned from Boy Scout camp , where he learned about cooking , lifesaving , caterpillars , and more .

Much of what he knows about electronics he 's learned from a neighbor ; radio , television , his friends , and the library are sources of information and ideas ; he learned which words not to use from his grandfather ; my wife and I taught him to swim ; and so on . Could it ever be solely or chiefly the school 's fault if a child fails ? Obviously , my answer is no . In my view school is of secondary importance , whether it 's at the elementary , junior high , or high school level ; the primary responsibility for education rests with families . One of the books under review here ( John Holt 's Teach Your Own ) shares that view . The other two ( Jonathan Kozol 's On Being a Teacher and Rudolf Flesch 's Mu Johnny Still Ca n't Read ) , although critical of what occurs in school , place a higher value on schooling ; both seem to believe that changing schools will change society .

" That leads to his premise : schools are bad on purpose : . . . the great majority of boring , regimented schools were doing exactly what they had always done and what most people wanted them to do , Teach children . . . that Life Is No Picnic . Teach them to Shut Up and Do What You 're Told . He admits to not caring about schools and apologizes for even using the term " home schooling . " For the past several years Holt has published a newsletter , " Growing Without Schooling , " which consists largely of letters from parents describing their " home schooling " experiences and news of court cases . Because I read the newsletter , 1 half-expected Teach Your Own to be a compilation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's much more , although there are a couple of chapters in which the author 's original prose is limited to , " A mother writes from ... " and similar connecting phrases . But the letters are compelling , and Holt also provides useful chapters on laws regarding home schooling , the value of libraries , and " learning disabilities , " which Holt sees as labels schools use to excuse their own Failures . Nowhere does Holt acknowledge the effect on home schooling of changes in family structure or the increase in working mothers . He writes for families with at least one parent at home . But he writes for all of those families , well-educated and unschooled alike , drawing on testimony from admittedly uneducated parents about their successes . Children , Holt believes , learn what they need to know when they need it , and their teachers should adopt the doctor 's credo : " first , do no harm .

After we had watched our beautiful daughter 's life , liberty , and creativity systematically destroyed by kindergarten teachers , Susan decided she wanted to stay at home the next year . . . For us , schools are Foreign lands that are difficult to imagine . Our life is Free and our work and learning are directed at goals that we hold dear to our needs , not the goals of society . We have taken control over our lives , we have attained power to run our own affairs . Susan takes care and responsibility for herself , she stands on her own two strong legs , she speaks clearly , thinks clearly and answers only to her conscience . She is happy , talkative , interesting and interested and can choose for her life any damn thing she pleases . Susan lives in a world of marvelous abundance ; her resources are unlimited . She has not been ' socialized ' by school to think that education is a supply of scarce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Holt does n't tell us is that Susan went back to school not long after that letter was written , when her parents separated ; last I heard she was still attending a " regular " school . Holt never explores the less cheerful side of any of the stories he prints , and he never admits the possibility that home schooling could be vexing , boring , or counterproductive . R UDOLF FLESCH is writing now , as he did in 7955 in Why Johnny Ca n't Read , about two ways of teaching reading : phonics versus " whole word " or " look-say . " In the phonics approach , children learn the sounds that letters , and combinations of letters , make ; that 's the alphabetic code . The look-say method requires memorization of whole words . Most reading experts whose work 1 know call that a false dichotomy ( some phonics is part of all reading instruction , they say ) , but Flesch says that compromise is impossible , because it would preserve look-say , which he blames for most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused by look-say , not television ; in fact , Flesch says , kids watch too much television because they ca n't read , and they ca n't read because of look-say . At several points in Why Johnny Still Ca n't Read Flesch speaks of a conspiracy against phonics on the part of the publishers of nonphonics textbooks ( the " dismal dozen ' he calls them ) and the International Reading Association . But he offers no proof , no evidence that somebody 's getting rich . I think Flesch believes that scholars and researchers support the look-say method because it provides them with plenty of lousy readers to perform expensive studies on ; those studies lead to slight modifications in look-say , which require new ( expensive ) textbooks , and then more ( expensive ) research . " Look-say , " Flesch maintains , is " an out-and-out intolerable sham , a device to destroy the education of a great nation 's children . " Despite its heated rhetoric , I hope this book reaches a wide audience , because Flesch is right about phonics . Children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part , a phonetic language ; once children learn the alphabetic code they become readers . It is as simple as that , and schools , teachers , and reading specialists often create more problems than they solve . Flesch said all this in 1955 , and in 1967 Professor Jeanne Chall of Harvard " settled " matters in favor of phonics in her book Learning to Read : The Great Debate . What 's more , reading textbook publishers all say they 've incorporated phonics into their texts . So why this book ? Flesch argues that the look-sayers have only pretended to change ; they 've tacked on a smattering of phonics but have n't abandoned look-say . Teachers now tell parents they 're using phonics , Flesch says , but they 're not , and kids are suffering . ( Like John Holt , Flesch does n't think all that much of learning disabilities ; even most dyslexia is caused by look-say , he says . ) He says we ca n't trust our school boards or our school leaders ; if the reading texts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Distar , Economy , Lippincott , and Open Court ) , then parents should teach their children phonics at home . Otherwise they 'll grow up to be poor readers . Jonathan Kozol has written two useful books about teaching nonreading adults , plus what is arguably the most influential book of the modern school reform movement , Death at an Early Age , for which he won a National Book Award in 1968.1 still recall reading that book in one gulp , then insisting my friends read it ; Kozol made it impossible for me , and thousands of other teachers like me , to ever again just " shut the classroom door and teach . " Because of that gift , I wish I had liked Kozol 's new book , On Being A Teacher , but unfortunately it 's not much more than a long magazine article , puffed up into book length . Its premise is that teachers can change society , by avoiding the mistakes of the 1960s ( unkempt dress , overreaction , etc. ) and by teaching with the words of people on society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woodrow Wilson , for example , to teach about social inequity : We want one class of people to have a liberal education , and we want one class of persons , a very much larger class of persons , of necessity , to forego the privileges of a liberal education and it into specific manual tasks . Or use Abraham Lincoln 's words in a lesson about racism : I am not , nor ever have been , in favor of bringing about in any way the social or political equality of the white and black races . . ! will say in addition that there is a physical difference between the white and black races which , I suppose , will forever forbid the two races living together upon terms of social and political equality ; and in as much as they can not so live , that while they do remain together there must be a position of the superiors and the inferiors ; and that I , as much as any other man , am in favor of the superior being assigned to the white man Kozol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers tend to avoid . He believes that most teachers would like to have their classes confront our social contradictions , if only they were n't afraid of being fired . He says Lincoln and Wilson will protect daring teachers ; apparently he believes that a school board 's anger would subside once it discovered the troublemaker was only quoting " Honest Abe , " but I do n't believe it . The board would find some other grounds for suspending the teacher , or firing him ? like " deviating from the prescribed curriculum , " the charge one school board leveled against a teacher who included Aristotle and Plato in his curriculum . Kozol is a preacher , and his book exhorts teachers to begin doing things they do n't do , and to become what they 're not . He wants teachers to gather regularly in " teacher centers " for fellowship and to exchange ideas ; to visit the homes of their students ; to cast off the shackles of teacher guides and develop their own ( ambitious and inventive ) lessons plans ; to become unafraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " gentle rebels . " I DO N'T think it works that way . 1 Where schools are exciting and successful , it 's usually because of an energetic principal and a coalition of parents , with a few teachers joining in . Some teachers do wonderful things with children , but their success usually is n't replicated unless the principal makes it happen . Kozol ignores that truth . He also skips over a more important truth , the precipitous decline in the academic ability of those entering teaching . Today , college students are studying just about anything but " education , " and teacher training institutions have had to lower their admission requirements to fill their classrooms . That means less able students will soon be teachers ; unless the career ladder changes , some of them will rise through the system to become principals and superintendents . My point is simply this : I think Jonathan Kozol is overly optimistic about today 's teachers and their interest in social change ; tomorrow 's teachers are likely to be even less concerned . The depressing sameness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the groups that have organized to defeat tuition tax credits and other aid to private schools really want to save public schooling , they 'd better begin talking about diversity within the system : open enrollment , magnet schools , more budget authority for individual principals , school-community coalitions , and the like . Then teaching would attract more teachers of the sort that Jonathan Kozol and I want in the classroom working with our children .
