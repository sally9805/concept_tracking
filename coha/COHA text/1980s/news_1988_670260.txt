WASHINGTON  --  Has the U.S. economy discovered a fountain of youth ? After 67 months of continuous growth , it has already survived well beyond the lifespan of previous peacetime expansions . And it still shows few signs of age . The latest indication of vigor came Friday , when the government reported that 346 , 000 jobs were created in June , driving the civilian unemployment rate down to 5. 3% . " It ' s stunning , " says Norman Robertson , a Mellon Bank economist . " These are gains one would expect to see when an expansion is in its very early stages , not when it is more than five years old . " The continued growth is even more remarkable given the unprecedented storms that have rocked the economy during the past five years : $200 billion budget deficits , $160 billion trade deficits , recession in the Rust Belt , depression in the oil patch , a wildly gyrating dollar , a record one-day plunge in the stock market , and now a drought that even threatens to dry up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rolling along . That persistent momentum does raise some risks . Inflation is accelerating modestly . And many analysts believe that if the rapid economic growth of the past six months continues , inflation will get worse , and the Federal Reserve will be forced to drive up interest rates to suppress it . The recent growth has been so impressive that some forecasters say the expansion could continue for years . One of the most ebullient is Prudential-Bache ' s Edward Yardeni , who writes of a " New Wave " economy in which nationwide recessions will be merely a bad memory . Although most analysts don ' t go that far , many see the expansion living on well into the next decade . General Electric ' s Walter Joelson recently persuaded his company ' s top executives to abandon their expectation of a downturn next year . The economist argued that the growing integration of the U.S. with the world economy rendered comparisons to past business cycles irrelevant . Strong foreign demand for U.S. exports , along with brisk capital spending fueled largely by foreign investment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he predicted . And listen to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , a man seldom accused of excessive optimism . " We had a great consumer boom in imports that left manufacturing undernourished , " he says . " Now , manufacturing can carry us for the next four years . " The optimists , however , still remain in the minority . In recent surveys , a majority of business economists predict a recession next year . Many businessmen and politicians agree . Sen. Sam Nunn has even suggested in private that a coming economic collapse is one reason he doesn ' t want to serve in the White House . " We ' re going to have another Hoover , " the Georgia Democrat told a colleague , " before we can have a Roosevelt . " And even Mr. Volcker warns that the government must adopt " appropriate policies " to hold down consumer spending and inflation if the expansion is to continue . Although refusing to discuss the central bank ' s policies publicly , the former Fed chief is said to consider them too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes his own final year at the Fed . Alan Greenspan , the current Fed chairman , will give his views of the economy when he testifies before Congress this week . The Fed has pushed up short-term interest rates by a full percentage point since March , and Fed officials indicate that they are prepared to tighten even more . But they still hope to avoid a jarring increase in its bellwether discount rate . And their cautious actions since the first of the year suggest that they will avoid the kind of precipitate move that would cut the expansion short . Also needed are measures to reduce the federal budget deficit , which contributes to fears of excessive spending . The president and Congress are certain to sidestep that sticky problem between now and the election . But advisers to both major presidential candidates say their man is likely to address the budget issue very early in his first term . " I ' m optimistic we ' ll get the policies needed , " says Fred Bergsten , who heads the Institute for International Economics , a Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukakis , will wake up the morning after the election and start thinking about getting re-elected . He is going to decide it ' s much too risky to skate through four more years of relying on foreigners to finance our budget deficits . " Recent progress in exporting has increased the ranks of those who believe the U.S. economy can continue to grow , albeit slowly , through the difficult period ahead . John Makin , an economist at the American Enterprise Institute , used to argue that the only way to narrow the trade deficit significantly would be through a recession  --  a painful but effective cure that always works because it drives down imports . Now , Mr. Makin has switched sides . " For the last six months , things have been falling into place , " he says . " I ' ve become much more optimistic " that the U.S. can deal with its budget and trade problems without a recession . The recent success of the U.S. and its allies in stabilizing the dollar has also encouraged many analysts . That ' s not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the nation still must service the huge debt incurred during the spending spree of the 1980s . Thus , " even if we avoid a recession , we ' re going to see very slow growth compared to what we ' ve seen historically , " says Lawrence Chimerine , the chairman of WEFA Group , an economic consulting firm . Moreover , growth in consumer spending will nearly halt in the years ahead as increased production goes for exports . " This time , the recession may happen more in the standard of living than in production , " says Neal Soss , an economist at First Boston Corp . " The fruits of our labor will be used to pay off debt . " David Hale , the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services , agrees : " We are looking at five years of stagnation in real consumer spending . " Retailers and other consumer-service industries could face tough times . But if the nation can avoid , or at least postpone , the hardship of a full-blown recession , that ' s good . Recessions hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And a recession now would be especially dangerous because of the weaknesses in the nation ' s financial system . What accounts for the unusual longevity of economic expansion in the 1980s ? Ironically , the trade deficit may hold the key . During the deficit-financed spending boom of the early 1980s , the growth of U.S. domestic spending far exceeded the growth of production ; imports skyrocketed , and the trade deficit widened . Now , with U.S. consumer spending slowing , the opposite is happening . Production growth is outpacing spending growth ; companies are exporting more , and the trade deficit is narrowing . In effect , the deficit has helped smooth out the wide swings in U.S. demand . " This recovery has been long , but slow , " says Brookings Institution economist Alice Rivlin . " As a result , the potential for exports to fill in the gap left by slowing consumption is very substantial . " Perhaps even more important is the behavior of inflation . Harvard ' s Lawrence Summers contends that no postwar economic expansion has died of old age ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to raise interest rates to head off inflation . This time , however , inflation remains surprisingly subdued . Price increases have picked up in recent months , but only moderately . And even though the jobless rate has hit its lowest level since 1974 , wage increases remain restrained , showing no sign of the wage-price spiral that plagued the 1970s . Noting the widespread talk of " the threat of economic overheating , " Mellon Bank ' s Mr. Robertson comments that " right now , you have to admit that wage increases are extremely modest . There seem to have been some very major structural changes in the labor market , and some important changes in the product markets as well , that have significantly reduced the economy ' s vulnerability to these cycles of accelerating inflation . " In part , the changes may be psychological . The trauma of the past two decades has left businesses exceedingly cautious . Battered by the sharp drop in inflation and the soaring dollar of the early 1980s , they are reluctant to allow wages and costs to rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decline of unions has reduced their power to push up wages . And foreign competition has imposed a new , strict discipline on U.S. companies . All of this helps prevent the excesses characteristic of an inflationary business boom . And without a boom , PrudentialBache ' s Mr. Yardeni notes , " it ' s difficult to have a bust . " Demographic trends are also helping to keep low unemployment from producing high inflation . During the 1970s , baby-boom teen-agers were entering the economy at a rapid rate . Young and inexperienced , they often were jobless  --  increasing the unemployment rate . Now , the number of teenagers entering the work force each year is roughly half of that in the early 1970s , and their jobless rate has declined . So today ' s 5. 3% unemployment rate suggests considerably more joblessness among mature workers  --  and therefore less wage pressure  --  than the same rate did in 1974 . " A few years ago , people would have said that 6. 5% was full employment , " says Robert Wescott , vice president of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to start looking at the high-inflation period of the 1970s as an aberration rather than the norm . Back in the 1960s , people thought 4% or 3. 5% was the full employment rate . " Despite such arguments , the Fed remains cautious and may conclude that it has to engineer some rise in short-term interest rates . But until more signs of wage acceleration appear , the rate increase is likely to be small . Mr. Greenspan , who had close ties to the Republican Party , is certainly not eager to precipitate a recession before the November election  --  a development that would probably destroy the election hopes of Vice President George Bush . And Fed officials will likewise be eager to avoid a recession early next year because that might destroy the opportunity to deal with the budget problem . The president and Congress aren ' t likely to approve tough spending cuts or tax increases in the face of a severe downturn . In addition , the fragility of the financial system is a strong argument for avoiding a recession for a few years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feds have been , " Princeton ' s Alan Blinder says . Kemper ' s Mr. Hale agrees : " A recession just isn ' t a policy choice . " One danger spot , many economists say , is the risk of a free-falling dollar . The U.S. has become increasingly reliant on a steady flow of money from abroad to finance its trade and budget deficits . But if foreign investors suddenly become reluctant to invest more of their money in the U.S. , the dollar could plummet . The only way to lure back overseas investors would be sharply higher interest rates , which could spark a recession . And if the U.S. and its allies can keep the dollar stable through early next year , the new president and Congress will have a chance to reduce the budget deficit and begin reversing the dangerous dependence on foreign money . On top of everything else , of course , continued expansion requires good luck . No one knows for certain what surprises await the economy in the next few years , and surprises  --  like the oil price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drastically . " To make a forecast for 1989 is very bold , " GE ' s Mr. Joelson admits , " and to make it for 1990 is almost irresponsible . " But for now , at least , there ' s some reason to hope that the U.S. can get through the next few years without a recession . " It ' s tricky , " Harvard economist Richard Cooper says , " but it can be done . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
