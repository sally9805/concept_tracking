Set ' em up bartender and pour it like you do n't own it . Tonight we toast Eddie Robinson , college football 's Old Man River , flowing sweeter and stronger than ever . Here 's to what he helped us forget . In a year when it 's an upset if a game comes off without an IRS audit , Robinson hit us with a stadium wave of nostalgia : a good coach with a simple program proving that with a little luck and 44 years of hard work a man can still win his way onto the front page . // And here 's to sport , which has a funny way of making amends . From the muck of baseball 's worst drug scandal rose Pete and 4,192 . From the dank of college football 's Dole Bowls comes Robinson and win No. 324 , the magic number that put him one ahead of Alabama 's Paul ( Bear ) Bryant and made him history 's winningest college football coach , big or small , thin or stout , black or white . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Robinson 's Grambling Tigers beat Prairie View A &amp; M 27-7 before an almost entirely black crowd of 36,652 , 35,908 of whom had purloined sideline passes as the clock counted down to history ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 .... Sensing impending mayhem , Grambling 's players formed a human retaining wall around the 66-year-old Robinson , chanting " No mo ' Bear ! " and inching their way to the tunnel like a giant , 160-pod beetle . The sight was so strange that , as they moved , Robinson abandoned his worried look and loosed a lovely grin . // Once inside the locker room , the incurable sentimentalist tried to keep his ducts dry . He had already cried that day at an 11 a.m. team meeting . Now , with the full realization in his throat of what he had done , Robinson scarcely made it past a postgame paragraph . " It has been my privilege pause to coach pause you young men .... " With that , the players began hollering , " Let it out , Coach ! Let it out ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not the only one . // This day 's tears had been a long time coming . To begin with , Robinson 's father , Frank , was gravely ill with Hodgkin 's disease in Baton Rouge General Hospital , and with the hoopla of the record , Robinson could n't visit him last week . " He does n't know what 's going on , " Robinson said . Too , the nation 's media had crammed into tiny Grambling , and elbows were knocking . // " Seems like every writer and TV man in the country has been here the last two weeks , " Robinson 's wife , Doris , said one day in their four-bedroom brick house , less than a long punt from the practice field . " And every one of ' em is hoping Eddie does n't drop dead before he does their piece . " Nightly , Robinson apologized to his team for being tardy to practice . " I believe I 've been late more this week than in my previous 43 years coachin ' , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old soreheaded bear . " // The record would soon be broken , but when it was , would Bear loyalists be sore-headed themselves ? Before the game they had seemed not . Robinson insists that he received not a single hate letter . Perhaps the only skittish moment came in Robinson 's office two days before the game . A white man with a goatee , a black leather vest and a Johnny Cash hat showed up unannounced . " Coach , I drove all the way from Hartselle , Alabama to do this , " he said . The room became quiet . Then the man stuck out his hand to shake . " I just want to tell you that if somebody has to beat the Bear , we are shore ' nuff glad it 's you , ' cause you are a gentleman , sir . " // Whether the South goes as Hartselle goes is unknown , but even Robinson  --  especially Robinson  --  knows that legends do n't budge easily . And when the budgee is one of the most beloved names in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , collars could get tight . Robinson worked hard to loosen them . " I could win 1,000 games and never replace the Bear , " Robinson said , and he meant it . // Indeed , the Bear and the Heir were friends . Bryant presented Robinson with the Walter Camp Foundation 's 1982 Distinguished American Award , though somebody else was scheduled to do it . When Bryant died , Robinson could n't get a flight , so he drove 400 miles through the night to Tuscaloosa , Ala. to attend the funeral . Once there , Robinson could not get past church guards and might have missed it had not some Alabama players escorted him into the service . // Still , not everybody was ready to let Robinson have his coronation , humble as he tried to make it . Enter the Asterisk Army , the writers and fans who sit in dimly lit booths in the backs of bars and try to stop time with pocket calculators . Their asterisk dogs Roger Maris and Henry Aaron , and now it hunts Robinson , charging that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caliber teams . // Robinson does n't try to refute that . " I grew up in the South , " he says . " I was told where to attend elementary school , where to attend junior high school , where to attend high school . When I became a coach , I was told who I could recruit , who I could play , where I could play and when I could play . I did what I could within the system . " More simply , Booker T. Washington once said , " Cast down your bucket where you are . " Robinson 's bucket is right where he left it  --  at the end of the rainbow . // According to Grambling associate athletic director Fred Hobdy , Bryant told the Grambling staff in the late 1970s , " Whatever league you 're in , whatever level , win there . " At times that required extraordinary perseverance at Grambling . " No man but Eddie would have worked under these conditions , " says Hobdy , who played for him in 1942 and ' 46-48 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robinson was a one-man athletic department . He would mow the football field , mark the lines , drill the drill squad , tape ankles , drive the injured to the doctor and write the game story for the local papers . One started , " Outlined against a blue-gray October sky .... " // The not so good old days lasted a long time . " Guys would come back to visit us , and they 'd say , ' Hey , you guys got grass to practice on ? ' " says defensive coordinator Fred Collins . True enough . Says Tank Younger , now the assistant general manager of the San Diego Chargers , " We practiced on dirt . " // Sometimes even dirt was a luxury . Once , in Montgomery , Ala. , Grambling was n't allowed to work out on a football field the day before the game , so Robinson stopped the bus on an empty parking lot and held practice there . Another time , after a Friday dinner , Robinson got the players to push the tables and chairs aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a down-and-out to the raisin salad and I 'll fake it to you . // Discrimination and anorexic budgets were just two of the trapdoors the Bear did n't encounter . Robinson recruited some 200 future NFL players  --  more than any other school  --  with a yearly budget about equal to Alabama 's outlay for stamps . He has recruited against major colleges offering prestigious scholarships , luxurious dorm rooms , plentiful training tables , big-time bowls , TV exposure and , as the NCAA is loath to find out , Lord knows what else . // Robinson 's achievement is that he worked for 44 seasons within the white system and then , on a Saturday night in Dallas , beat that system . " He has overcome the shackles , " Hobdy says . " He won in spite of the handicaps. " // Now he was winging toward more wins than any other man , courtesy of Prairie View , the team he had beaten 17 of the previous 18 years , but the team he was suddenly likening to Leahy 's Irish . During one interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I 'll just bet you Prairie View is practicin ' right this minute . " If Prairie View was , it did n't help . Grambling scored on its first and third possessions to go ahead 14-0 . Tiger defensive backs intercepted five passes , returning one for a touchdown and a 20-0 halftime lead . All that remained was to wait and wonder how to act when The Moment came , a feeling not unlike holding a pose while waiting for the electronic flash to warm up . // Still , all one had to do was look down the Grambling sideline to get a jolt : Young and old Robinson products had come to the Cotton Bowl , from Younger , the first NFL star from an all-black school , to Hall-of-Famer Willie Davis to Doug Williams , the most successful black NFL quarterback , to Grambling president Dr. Joseph B. Johnson , who had been recruited by Robinson . " This is a record made of players , " Robinson told his team before the game . " It 's a record made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your chance to leave your footprints in the sands of time . " // Footprints were fine for some , but as The Moment drew nigh , one player , defensive end Chris Adams , wanted something more tangible . He had sneaked a Kodak Instamatic onto the bench and was snapping his own pictures of Robinson as the seconds dwindled down . " I want to have something to remember this by , " he said . // " People can do what they want with the record , " Robinson said . " They can put an asterisk on it if they want . That 's their business . But look , I got my inspiration from all coaches , from college coaches and high school coaches , black and white . I remember Willie Davis would come back and tell me all about Vince Lombardi . Man , that lit fires under me . That got me burnin ' . I took my inspiration from the great American coaches  --  Warner and Stagg . Man , I got to watch the Bear work ! And I worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always knew my part to play , and if my part ended up having something to do with history , then I 'm happy . I never let anybody change my faith in this country . All I want is for my story to be an American story , not black and not white . Just American . I want it to belong to everybody . " // When will the story end ? Robinson 's record may stand as long as Rose 's . He can coach four more seasons  --  Louisiana state law requires that he retire at 70  --  but by then , he could have 360 wins , a fur piece from No. 2 John Gagliardi of St. Johns-Minnesota at 235 , No. 3 Bo Schembechler of Michigan at 190 and No. 4 Joe Paterno of Penn State at 180 . " I hope somebody will break it , " says Robinson . " I 'd like to see it . " // Here 's hoping . And here 's to you , Mr. Robinson . You grow old like a river , deeper and swifter every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away with you .
