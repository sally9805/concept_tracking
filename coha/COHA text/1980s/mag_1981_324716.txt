MOMMIE DEAREST Directed by Frank Perry Screenplay by Frank Yablans , Frank Perry , Tracy Hotchner and Robert Getchell <P> It is not easy being a working mother-especially if your boss happens to be Louis B. Mayer and your job category is movie star . It is especially not easy if one of your adopted children turns out to be the spoiled and charmless brat portrayed in this silly movie about the domestic life of Joan Crawford . The sympathy one is supposed to feel for the poor little rich waif ( played at different ages by Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid ) slides away from her and onto the fashionably padded shoulders of the actress , whom Faye Dunaway 's makeup artist , Lee C. Harman , gets just right . It was Crawford , after all , who had the career problems , the man problems , the drinking problem and , finally , the aging problem . That she sometimes lost her temper at home is hardly the stuff of tragedy , or even good melodrama . Yes , she occasionally raised her hand to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible abuse every day-and do n't have backyard swimming pools to soothe their feelings . Or get to write vindictive autobiographies that become bestsellers because Mommie Dearest was also Mommie Famous . <P> Lacking psychological intelligence or , for that matter , awareness of Hollywood sociology , Mommie Dearest is just a collection of screechy scenes further distanced by convictionless direction . Confronted by a movie without narrative tension or human interest , one is finally reduced to watching the paint dry-on Dunaway 's face . - R.S.
