" What we 're looking for is good kaizens . " <P> " Watch that muda . " <P> " We have to nemawashi this . " <P> Those are American autoworkers talking about building a car . You know , blue collars with tattoos on their forearms and nicknames like " Animal . " They talk like that because they work for the Japanese , who now have more companies in America making cars than America does . <P> What they 're saying is , let 's discuss ( nemawashi ) how to keep making improvements ( kaizens ) and avoid waste ( muda ) . And that 's what they 're doing . This is not how they talked  --  or worked  --  when GM ran this factory six years ago . <P> At the time General Motors closed its plant in Fremont , Calif. , in 1982 , the factory had one of the worst labor-relations records in the country . " We were fighting with GM all the time , " says United Auto Workers committeeman Ed Valdez . " The product was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . ' Ship it ! Ship it ! ' they said . " Today , working for New United Motor Manufacturing , Inc. , a joint venture formed by GM and Toyota in 1983 , the same workers are producing almost defect-free Chevrolets and Toyotas with a higher efficiency rating than any GM plant . <P> The difference is that two very dissimilar cultures have come together  --  and sometimes have not come together  --  to produce what has been hailed as " a new kind of workplace . " Back in the early ' 80s , Toyota 's president said the company would never operate a U.S. plant organized by the U.A.W. For their part , more than a few U.A.W. people said they 'd never work for " the Japs . " Five years later , the effect the two cultures have had on each other can be summed up in one sentence : the Americans are working better , and the Japanese are enjoying life more . <P> Toyota 's task within the joint venture was to implant its efficient , low- cost production system in GM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees at NUMMI , while Toyota has 36 , including the president and executive vice president . One of the first things the Japanese did was eliminate executive perks such as reserved parking places and a separate cafeteria . Then they turned the top-down style of American management  --  the tradition of the industrial engineer as the first and last word on how a car is made  --  on its head . As NUMMI president Kan Higashi says , " The person who does the job knows it best . " <P> The envied Japanese production system is based not just on high-tech robotics but also on sweetspeak . An employee is a " team member . " A foreman is a " group leader . " Teams in the plant consist of six to eight team members who rotate jobs , with each team headed by an hourly team leader . Three to five teams are led by a salaried group leader . They are to work together in an atmosphere of " mutual trust . " <P> " The main reason American industry has lost competitiveness , " Higashi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to American management on this we must go down the stairs to the people . They wo n't come up to us.
