Astronomers for decades have offered a persuasive argument to explain how stars are born : one of the huge , tenuous clouds of gas and dust that pervade the galaxy collapses under its own weight , heats up dramatically and bursts into nuclear flame . Until now though , this has been only a model . But in a report to be published in the Oct. 1 issue of Astrophysical Journal Letters , a team of astronomers will announce that they finally have supporting evidence . Says Charles Lada , professor of astronomy at the University of Arizona : " We 've detected what we believe to be the actual collapse of a cloud to form a star very much like our own sun . " <P> It has been difficult to find a newborn star because outer regions of the collapsing cloud hide the new star within . Ordinary light can not penetrate the haze . The long-wavelength infrared and radio waves produced by a warming embryonic star can pierce it , however , just as a radar signal can cut through the densest fog . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite ( IRAS ) was an ideal place to start . Although the satellite operated for only ten months in 1983 , it sent back information on more than a quarter-million cosmic sources of infrared radiation . One of them was in the constellation Ophiuchus , some 520 light-years away . " What the IRAS survey indicated , " says Team Astronomer Bruce Wilking of the University of Missouri , " was that this source was 40 degrees above absolute zero ( - 233 degreesC ) , extremely cold by our standards but warm enough by interstellar standards that it led us to think this would be an interesting object to look at . " Best of all , the object , designated IRAS 16293-2422 , was relatively close , making it easier to see finer detail . <P> The astronomers then switched from infrared to radio observations , using the twelve-meter radio telescope atop Kitt Peak , Ariz . Reason : infrared radiation gives information on the cloud 's overall temperature , but radio waves carry more detailed data on the motion within . Interstellar clouds are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and each emits radio waves of a specific frequency when heated or otherwise " excited . " By tuning their telescope to the right frequency , astronomers monitor the behavior of different molecules and consequently learn more about conditions within the cloud . <P> According to Arizona Astronomer Erick Young , " We chose carbon monosulfide because it is a probe of the densest parts of these clouds . " The molecule is most excited when it is most compressed . In the center of the cloud , says Lada , " we found that we were seeing carbon monosulfide in a very excited state . " In the outer reaches , though , the molecules were much calmer . There was a dense core at the center of the cloud . It was also clear that there was systematic motion inside . Just as a train whistle is higher in pitch as it approaches than when it recedes , radio waves also vary in frequency according to direction of motion . Using the radio telescope like a police-radar detector , the astronomers measured the movement within the cloud . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooler regions , " reports Wilking . " It was as we probed deeper and deeper that we began to see evidence of gas falling inward . "
