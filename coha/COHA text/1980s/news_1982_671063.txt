In a statement issued in conjunction with the tenth anniversary Sunday of the Shanghai Communique that opened the way to formal ties , the State Department said that President Reagan had sent a personal letter to Prime Minister Zhao Ziyang commemorating the event , but that no similar message had yet been received from the Chinese. // The two nations have been engaged for more than a month in intensive discussions in Peking on trying to find a formula to overcome China ' s outspoken opposition to continued American arms sales to Taiwan . China says the sales infringe on its sovereignty. // // ' Extremely Sensitive ' Talks // Arthur W. Hummel Jr. , the American Ambassador to China , has been conducting the talks with senior Chinese officials with a maximum of secrecy . Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig Jr. , in an interview this month , called those talks " extremely sensitive. " // In one of many signs of deep official resentment over the Taiwan issue , the anniversary of the Shanghai Communique is being virtually ignored in China . ( Page 12. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an appearance before the Conservative Political Action Conference , a group whose sympathies are with Taiwan. // " Too frequently today , we neglect to take full weight of the strategic importance of the People ' s Republic of China , " he said . <> <> Attacks Hanoi Government // In particular , he noted that the Chinese had been what he called a " restraint " on Vietnam . Mr. Haig drew applause for his attack on the Hanoi Government , which he termed " an international pariah " for occupying Cambodia. // Well-placed Administration officials said that there had been thought of trying to resolve the Taiwan issue so that a joint Chinese-American statement could be issued this weekend in time for the Shanghai anniversary . But this proved impossible , officials said. // There is hope within the Administration that if Mr. Zhao responds favorably to Mr. Reagan ' s letter , the two documents might be published in lieu of a joint statement. // The Chinese , warning that they might cut back on relations if an agreement is not reached , have sought a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality and quantity of arms sold to Taiwan , as well as a pledge to phase out the program in a set period of time . The Administration has responded , officials said , that it can not agree to any such limits because of previous pledges , embodied in the Taiwan Relations Act , to provide whatever is needed for Taiwan ' s legitimate defense needs. // According to officials , the United States has suggested to the Chinese that they be patient and recognize that as Peking-Taiwan relations improve in the future there would be diminishing need for American arms . In that respect , some experts on China have pointed to the significance of plans for a Chinese women ' s softball team being invited to go to Taiwan for an international tournament this summer . This would be the first such official group that has gone to Taiwan if the trip goes ahead as now seems likely. // In the statement today , the United States did not go into the details of the negotiations , except to say that it was making " a good faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good faith is matched on the Chinese side , we believe we can anticipate a substantial degree of further advance in United States-Chinese relations over the coming decade , " it said . <> <> Put Situation in Positive Light // The State Department sought to put as positive a gloss on the situation as possible , with the stress on the strategic and regional convergence of views . It said that although there were " disagreements " between the two countries , " these kinds of disagreements are normal between two friendly , nonallied sovereign states. " // " Our shared global strategic and regional interests far outweigh any of these other differences , " the statement said . It cited , as examples , the two countries ' equal concern " over the regional instability engendered by the Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan and the Soviet-backed Vietnamese military occupation of Kampuchea. " // " No matter what may happen on other issues , our basic strategic compatibility is a fact of international relations , " the statement said. // But it conceded that " of course , the further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short term - may at any time be affected by other aspects of our relations . " <> <> Trying to Resolve Differences // As to the current negotiations , the State Department said , " of course , there are areas of disagreement between us and Peking . " But it said that " as we enter the second decade since the Shanghai Communique , we are in the midst of a good faith effort to resolve these differences. " // The Shanghai Communique was issued on Feb. 28 , 1972 , at the end of President Richard M. Nixon ' s visit to China at a time when the two sides lacked diplomatic relations . As a result of that trip , the two sides opened up quasi-diplomatic missions. // On Dec. 15 , 1978 , the United States and China formally established diplomatic relations and the United States severed official ties with Taiwan on Jan. 1 , 1979 . But the United States and Taiwan have maintained unofficial missions in both capitals , and Washington has continued to supply Taiwan with arms .

" // " The United States values good relations with China , " it continued . " The United States and China share a number of vitally important global and regional interests and objectives , above and beyond our mutual interest in productive bilateral relations. " // " Tremendous progress has been registered in United States-China relations in the decade since the Shanghai Communique , " the State Department said . " We are determined to do all we can to preserve and expand these achievements . Since the beginning of this Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance the relationship. " // The statement did not detail those " initiatives , " but at the time that Mr. Haig went to China last June , the Administration announced it was taking a number of steps to end discrimination against China such as allowing China to buy certain military equipment normally barred to Communist nations . But the Chinese have so far refused to take advantage of the offer . Mr. Haig said earlier this month that plans to discuss military sales to China had become " hostage " to the discussions about Taiwan. //
