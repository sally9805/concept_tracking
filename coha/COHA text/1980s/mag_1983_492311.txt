// LIGHT UP YOUR ARYNX FOR CHRISTMAS by Cory SerVaas , M. D. I met a friend in a large mall one Saturday before Christmas , shopping earnestly for a Christmas tree light bulb to replace one that had burned out . Given the assignment by his wife , who ran the best decorated house in the city , here was this hulk of a man carrying around a little burned-out bulb going from store to store trying to match it with one that would light up . The situa-tion would n't have been so ludi-crous had he not been an im-portant executive whose salary in six figures must make his time worth something like $500 an hour . He laughed at his afternoon 's plight and con-fessed that surely he could have bought comparable new lights for the entire tree at less cost than this search . I thought of my friend 's silly little light bulb again today when I called to tell him that a mutual acquaintance of ours  --  I 'll call him Charlie  --  had undergone radical head and neck surgery for cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked heavily and liked his Scotch . But in addition , this otherwise prudent man had feelings of immortality . He displayed macho pride when he would tell us that he had n't been to a doctor for 30 years . He was strong as a horse and he had never been sick . Now he was devastated with his voice box removed . Unfortunately , this victim , as most do , had waited until he was hoarse to go for the checkup , which could have saved his voice box and greatly improved his life expectancy if he had been diagnosed when his cancer first began . He was vulnerable for this cancer since he was a heavy smoker and drinker , a combination which makes one more susceptible . Drinking without smoking seems not to carry much increased risk , but smoking and drinking , especially whiskey , adds to the risk substantially . Before all the holiday merrymaking begins , it might be well for those of us who are over 40 to change our priorities regarding little light bulbs . We would do well to shop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , handy-dandy new laryngoscope . The scope would come with a doctor on the viewing end , of course . This new way of viewing the larynx is such a vast improvement over the old-fashioned miner 's headlight and curved mirror that even family practitioners or internists , who are n't specializing in ear , nose and throat , can see the vocal cords with great ease . When I called my light-bulbsearching friend to tell him about Charlie , I asked him if he had ever had his vocal cords visualized . He had n't . I thought as much and I have mailed him a gift certificate that must be redeemed with my favorite ear , nose and throat man for one laryngoscopy . If you care about your over-40 spouse , your parents or a friend who smokes , such a Christmas gift is not a bad idea . As we approach the season for parties , I want to report that among our readers there are 527 of you who answered our survey with information that would put you in the " heavy smoking and drinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this classification have never had your vocal cords visualized . You told us this. * We strongly urge you , no matter how well you feel , to find a physician with a comfortable fiber-optic laryngoscope or a right-angle telescope or an ear , nose and throat doctor ( ENT ) who can see your vocal cords no matter what tools he uses  --  and have your vocal cords seen once a year . Smoking increased the risk for laryngeal cancer 40 times that of the nonsmoker in an Irish study . Most ENT doctors believe that everyone over 40 should have his vocal cords seen each year as a precaution whether or not they smoke . It is a harmless , noninvasive procedure . Cancer of the larynx will strike 11,000 Americans this year , and the majority of these victims will require complete removal of the larynx and surrounding cancerous tissue ( laryngectomies ) . This is distressing since a cancerous lesion in the larynx , if discovered early , can be treated with radiation and no surgery at all . Our research on the larynx via the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Harold C. Klein of Ohio , who tells the story of how the preventable death of a patient ten years ago prompted him to crusade for more thorough examination of the larynx . The man who died had been his patient for years and had received what the doctor considered good medical care . But , like most non-ENT specialists , Dr. Klein failed to examine the man 's larynx . He did n't find the fatal cancer growing there . When it was diagnosed by another doctor , it was too late to treat it . At this point Dr. Klein , who is affiliated with the Mount Sinai Medical Center and the Case Western Reserve University Medical School , was determined to find a better way to see the larynx . He has now mounted a medical soapbox to speak out for the use of the relatively new laryngeal telescope that makes it easy for even the most squeamish medical student , with only a little training , to get a clear view of the larynx in a high percentage of cases  --  and the examination takes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck surgeon who sees many cancer of the larynx patients after their diagnosis , agrees that Dr. Klein 's plea is an important one . " I must say his experience of losing a patient is not an unusual story at all , " said Dr. Singer . " Many of these early cancer patients will be mistakenly treated with antibiotics until they are incurable . You see this more often than not , really , " he said . Dr. Singer agreed that medical students should be taught to see the cords with the newer techniques . Especially so , because there is a nice side effect in that it improves their ability to perform endotracheal intubations . " It helps anesthesia residents and those involved in trauma CPR . It is very important for them to have some concept of where the larynx is and what it looks like ... so some good comes from that , really , besides the cancer screening , " Dr. Singer said . He emphasized that , with large optic companies producing the scopes , the competition is bringing the price down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few hundred dollars . Dr. Klein points out that telescope laryngoscopy is a " skill " that requires no great proficiency and can be learned from a simple demonstration at one sitting . He believes it should be taught in our medical schools in place of mirror laryngoscopy , which is an arduous maneuver for the nonspecialist . He further believes that it 's more fruitful than many of the accepted routine procedures and should be incorporated into every complete physical . For more than a hundred years the angled laryngeal mirror had been the only tool available for looking over the top of the tongue and down into the throat . Now , Dr. Klein asks , " Has there been a reduction in the mortality figures since the effective right angle telescopic laryngoscope and the fiber-optic laryngoscope have become available ? Are these tumors being discovered earlier ? Is the roster of candidates for the Lost Chord Club shrinking ? ' No ' is the answer to all of these questions , " he says . The reason most cancers of the larynx are n't discovered until too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients alone . In a 1979 survey of all primary physicians of the Ohio State Medical Society , 70 percent of those answering admitted that they were unable to examine a larynx in the course of a patient visit ; and less than 4 percent included an inspection of the larynx as part of their " complete " physical examination . When I interviewed my own ENT professor , Dr. Jack Summerlin , I began to see the problem clearly . ENT instructors are often practicing clinicians . These well-intentioned men are so expert at the use of the old fashioned right angle mirror and the indirect lighting from the head mirror that they sincerely believe their students will all quickly learn to be equally expert . When these fledgling doctors practice , however , the mirror fogs up , they ca n't see and they are embarrassed when the patient gags . A vast majority soon give it up as a lost cause and do n't examine the larynx at all . In the Ohio survey , many doctors questioned why they had not been better trained to " examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they wished they could see the larynx and some even wrote the lament , " I have never seen a larynx . " Dr. Summerlin , who taught at Indiana University , feels that the old method should n't be difficult to master , but since doctors have n't been doing the exams during physicals , he too believes we should begin teaching them to use the telescope in medical school classes . Another strong advocate of routine laryngeal exams is Dr. Ken Cooper , better known for his Aerobics Center in Dallas . I had an occasion to take a senior citizen and heart patient to his clinic to have him evaluated for an exercise program . Dr. Cooper 's evaluation does n't stop at the heart . No one leaves the clinic without having his vocal cords examined with state-of-the-art equipment . The average patient with laryngeal cancer consults three physicians and waits up to eight months before the diagnosis is made , according to a recent report in the Journal of Family Practice . About 95 percent of the laryngeal cancer occurs in areas easly accessible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent , if recognized and treated early ( e.g. , tainly changed my world for the better , " she told us . Light Up The Larynx If your church , Kiwanis Club , Rotary Club or other service organization is raising money for worthwhile health projects , laryngoscopes would be good contributions , especially since the publicity would make people more aware of the need for such a routine exam . Some sources : AO Scientific Instruments of Southbridge , Massachusetts , makes a flexible laryngoscope . Astralite Corp . of Anaheim , Calibetter than 95 percent cure rate for small , localized carcinomas of the vocal cords ) , but progressively worsens the longer diagnosis and treatment are delayed . Early diagnosis is quite possible long before symptoms arise . Some cancers may grow silently for long periods before causing symptoms . A patient is lucky if the lesion hits the vocal cords . If it does n't , it continues to grow pain free and without symptoms . On the vocal cords the lesion will , of course , cause this telltale hoarseness . Men suffer from this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the following should seek treatment : ? Hoarseness persisting over a week , especially in the absence of infection . ? Pain including soreness on one side of the throat . ? Discomfort when eating . ? The sensation of " something stuck in the throat . " ? Spitting up of blood . ? An earache in one ear in an adult over 40 also suggests the possibility of a tumor in the nasopharynx , which can be seen by laryngoscopy . We lead the world in incidence of cancer , but fortunately we also lead in how to make do with it once it strikes . There still is life after a laryngectomy . And it is no longernecessary for these victims to sound like a robot with an artificial burp noise produced while one finger is used to close an opening in the trachea . A new valve produced by a head and neck surgeon , Dr. Mark Singer , and Dr. Eric Bloom , a speech pathologist , has improved the lives of laryngeal cancer patients tremendously by allowing them to speak normally from the diaphragm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their innovation , a small plastic valve , is now available for installation in cities throughout the country . Earlier , Dr. Singer did laryngectomies , or insertions into former laryngectomy patients from around the world while their device was awaiting approval for distribution by the FDA . For a Baltimore trial lawyer who had continued to practice after his laryngectomy , the valve meant he no longer needed to hold a finger on his artificial voice box . He could gesture with both hands to the jury ! A happy husband said , " Now I can hug my wife with both arms while I tell her I love her . " Mary Jane Renner , a kindergarten teacher from Louisville , is back teaching her children in a nearly normal voice . " My prayers were answered and I thank the Lord for the marvelous work of Dr. Singer and Dr. Bloom .
