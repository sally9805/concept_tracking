 | This week Beverly Sills ? the sweetheart of American opera ? gives up the stage . After 25 years , Sills , 51 , will end her singing career at the New York City Opera just as she began it ? as the dazzling enchantress Rosalinda in Johann Strauss 's " Die Fledermaus . " Not surprisingly , it will be no ordinary " Fledermaus . " The glittery ballroom scene ? the only act of the opera to be staged ? will be jammed with celebrities , from Mary Martin and Cynthia Gregory to Zubin Mehta and Placido Domingo . The top ticket price ? it is a benefit for the City Opera ? is $1,000 . In short , it will be a glorious end to a glorious career . It will also celebrate a new Sills epoch at City Opera . Since July 1979 , Sills has also been the City Opera 's general director , having succeeded Julius Rudel as head of the company . And although her first year was one of transition ? Rudel had already chosen the new productions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bright and bubbly , has been much in evidence . It extends from her cozily cluttered office to promotional letters signed with " a big hug to you all " to red , white and blue banners that proudly proclaim , " New York City Opera ? Where Opera Comes Alive . " The change lies as much in substance as in style . For years the City Opera has been tagged as the " other " company at New York 's Lincoln Center . Sills is determined to change that . " We 're not a second company , we 're unique , " she says . " The Metropolitan Opera is the greatest international house in the world . We are 98 per cent American . I want us to become the national opera company of the United States . " To that end , she has begun a nationwide talent search for young singers , directors and conductors . She is also emphasizing the sort of unfamiliar repertory that will not overlap with the Met . The next few seasons will include , for example , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " " I Lombardi " ) and three baroque jewels ( Handel 's " Alcina , " Gluck 's " Alceste " and Rameau 's " Dardanus " ) . But Sills , the consummate singing actress , also knows the importance of a sense of excitement . She is playing up the company 's singers as never before . " I want the screaming , the kind of contagious energy that throws itself onstage , " she says . She has also lured such stars as Sherrill Milnes , Grace Bumbry and Frederica von Stade for future productions and she is courting famous designers and directors . Broadway 's Harold Prince , for example , will direct three new productions . " Opera is tremendous theater , " says Sills . " I wo n't accept beautiful singing without drama . " This season ? in effect , Sills 's first ? has already shown a fresh imagination . Bizet 's " Les Pecheurs de Perles " ( " The Pearl Fishers " ) has not had a major New York production since 1916 . Otto Nicolai 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buried by " Falstaff , " Verdi 's masterpiece on the same subject . In the risky realm of contemporary opera , Sills unveiled " An American Trilogy , " an evening of three one-act premieres by native sons . Priestess : " The Pearl Fishers , " composed when Bizet was only 24 , is hardly " Carmen . " Its plot , about two friends who are both in love with the priestess Leila , creaks from contrivance to contrivance . Yet its melodies , especially the famous tenorbaritone duet , " Au fond du temple saint , " are among the most shimmering in opera . The production , borrowed from the @#  | Greater Miami Opera , complemented the pastel delicacy of the music : a backdrop of blue ocean and hazy moon was framed by simple Hinduesque statuary and bamboo trees . What projected most strongly ? as it should ? was the singing . Barry McCauley , one of the company 's most dashing young tenors , and Diana Soviero , one of its remarkable stable of sopranos , teamed up as the sexiest pagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And their voices were as striking as their looks . Coquettish Wife : " American Trilogy " took courage : few opera companies these days are willing to gamble on such experiments . Except for Thomas Pasatieri ? whose monodrama about an embittered wife , " Before Breakfast , " was originally composed for Sills ? the composers were relatively unproven in opera . " Madame Adare , " about a woman in therapy who ca n't decide whether to become a movie star or an opera diva , was the collaboration of Stanley Silverman and librettist Richard Foreman , known for their zany avantgarde music dramas . The third work , " The Student From Salamanca , " a commedia dell'arte-style confection about an old man and his coquettish wife , was only the second opera written by Jan Bach , a professor of music at Northern Illinois University . None of the three carried the evening very far . " Before Breakfast , " essentially a modern mad scene ( with a libretto by Frank Corsaro ) , was musically intense ? but , in the end , predictable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parody of a parody with its hodgepodge of musical quotes . " The Student From Salamanca " got off to a good start with its blend of witty lyrics , frothy ensembles and melodies that conjured up the spirit of Rossini . But it was far too long : halfway through , the souffle fell . The pleasure was all in the singing and the acting ? traditionally one of the City Opera 's strong points . As Madame Adare , soprano Carol Gutknecht vamped and belted ' em out convincingly as the devil ( Harris Poor ) egged her on . In " Before Breakfast , " soprano Marilyn Zschau just missed a tour de force performance ; most of her words were unintelligible . Still , her highly nuanced singing and her acting ? doing the shimmy , yelling at the neighbors ? were verismo perfect . Mezzo Beverly Evans , as the worldly servant Cristina in " The Student From Salamanca , " stood out in a cast of accomplished comics ? as much for her saucy manner as her sultry voice . The City Opera , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at comedies . This season , the final new production ? Nicolai 's neglected " The Merry Wives of Windsor " ? was a case in point . It showed that there is room enough for two Sir Johns : Nicolai 's work , if a bit long , is full of romping ensembles , melodies that tickle the ear and ample opportunity for pleasing buffoonery . William Wildermann 's Falstaff was an infinitely winning old sot , with a bass voice as big as his paunch . Carol Vaness and RoseMarie Freni were the merry-voiced wives , and Vinson Cole 's sweet tenor gave the role of the young lover , Fenton , great charm . It is much too soon to judge the Sills regime , but there is no doubt about the difficulty of her task . In many ways , the City Opera is a betwixt-and-between house . On the one hand , it ca n't afford to be the brash , experimental company it once was : few people will pay as much as $20 a ticket for contemporary works of questionable value like " American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket will not buy the sort of international stars and opulent - productions that draw many operagoers . What Sills must do is sharpen the City Opera 's profile and sell it as the place to hear the very best American talent and see consistently innovative , offbeat productions . Shoestring : The biggest problem is financial . The company is so strapped that costs can not exceed $150,000 per production , and the shoestring often shows . The only thing wrong with " Merry Wives , " for example , was the skimpy set . " The Met 's deficit is larger than our budget , " laments Sills . She plans to continue borrowing productions from other companies and to sign up directors and designers known for flair rather than lavishness . Yet things are looking up financially for the company . Ticket sales have soared 8 or 9 per cent over last year ? owing , at least in part , to the continuing shutdown of the Met , where tentative agreement was reached last weekend to end its labor dispute . The company stands to gain $1 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legendary fund raiser . One patron is underwritingfive new operettas , to the tune of $750,000 . " Now , if only I can get somebody to do that for my Verdi operas , " says Sills , with a gleam in her eye that shows she could play Rosalinda forever . 81
