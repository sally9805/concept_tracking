Though Wall Streeters voted for him in heavy numbers last November , their euphoria over Ronald Reagan was short-lived . Soon after Election Day , the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks pierced 1,000 for the first time in four years . The widely watched indicator was then on a roller-coaster through the next several months , reaching 1,024 , its highest close so far this year , on April 27 . Slowly at first , but then with increasing momentum , doubts turned into downright disbelief . <P> Last week , as trading resumed after Labor Day , brokers stood long-faced among the Dow 's smoldering ruins : down more than 170 points to 851 , the lowest level in 15 months and about where it was a decade ago . The American Exchange , with a high proportion of energy company listings , was hit almost as hard . Its index fell from 375 in May to 331 at the end of last week . But , in response to indications that credit growth is slowing , stocks rallied a bit late in the week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the week . <P> The highflyers of last spring have lately been almost all in the dumps . Chief among them are energy and defense stocks , hit hard by slumping oil prices and less certain Administration defense commitments . Itek , an optical systems maker that could benefit from the iffy Stealth bomber project , dropped from $42 in May to $21 per share . Other defense issues that were off sharply : General Dynamics , down from $33 to $25 ; Martin Marietta ( $68 to $51 ) ; United Technologies ( $59 to $44 ) ; McDonnell Douglas ( $37 to $30 ) ; and Raytheon ( $49 to $40 ) . Among energy stocks , Cities Service , a strong gainer only a short time earlier as a result of takeover and merger talk , lost $20 per share in three weeks and sank to $46 . Marathon , another favorite among oil stocks , skidded from $80 to $62 in four weeks . <P> Long-term bonds suffered , and badly . Their yields rose with the general level of interest rates , up to 17% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels failed to attract investors , who saw no reason to tie up their money for as long as 40 years of perhaps volatile bond prices and high inflation . <P> Both stocks and bonds have been depressed in recent months , in part because investors now find more attractive places to put their money . Popular money-market certificates are more certain investments , and they now pay about 17% interest . In the past six months more than $50 billion has flowed into money-market funds . <P> There was no mystery about the recent selloff . Basically , Wall Street does not believe that Congress will reduce the budget by enough to make up for the huge tax cuts it passed in July . Said H. James Toffey , a managing director of First Boston Corp. : " Wall Street was always scared of tax cuts without commensurate spending cuts . " The Administration 's budget slashing efforts were nowhere near deep enough to meet its goal of a $42.5 billion federal deficit for fiscal 1982 , or to make possible a balanced budget by 1984 , as Reagan promised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance the growing flow of red ink , interest rates would tend to stay high .
