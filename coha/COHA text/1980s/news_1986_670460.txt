How different has been revealed from intensive study of riverside hunting camps painstakingly brought to light under layers of sand spread by the river ' s annual floods . The sands preserved camps here and elsewhere in the Paris basin with minimal disturbance , documenting the ways of life of Ice Age dwellers in detail available in few other places. // It is almost as though one could sneak onto an overlook and gaze at the reindeer hunters camped here as the last ice sheet retreated from Belgium to the north . Vast herds of reindeer sought shallow fords across the Seine , and the hunters with their flint-tipped spears awaited them. // To preserve these precious records of the past , scientists have made plaster casts of entire camp sites and moved them into shelters for later study . The casts show fireplaces filled with heat-fractured stones used by ice age cooks . Surrounding them are a multitude of reindeer bones , including ribs and other long bones broken to extract marrow . Fragments of flints define centers of tool and weapon making. // Bare areas show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ground for sleeping . At the entrance of each tent stood a hearth , used for warming the tent and , in some cases , for cooking . Of more than 20 hearths uncovered here , three are so close together that they may have served one very large tent. // The settlements do not appear to have been long-lived , in contrast with settlements in Germany where post holes imply more permanent occupancy . Those discovered here document a previously little known hunting culture - a rugged way of life that had some features in common with that of modern caribou-dependent Eskimos , but little in common with those who , several thousand years earlier , decorated cave walls in Spain and southern France with pictures of mammoths , woolly rhinos , urus bulls and the like. // When the hunters were camped here the mammoths had either moved north as the ice retreated or had been wiped out . The nature of this region ' s inhabitants varied radically in the Ice Ages . In the warm period before the last cycle of glaciations , hippopotamuses and rhinoceroses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and withdrew in a succession of oscillations , reaching a maximum between 18 thousand and 22 thousand years ago . Human populations continued to thrive in southwestern Europe , where the warm Gulf Stream was close enough to soften the climate . Those populations ' tools were the same as those used here , but their hunting methods were different. // As the ice retreated hunters became established farther north and their hunting changed so as to exploit the abundant reindeer . Pollen deposits suggest that the Paris basin was covered with grassy steppes , fir trees and birch , growing along the deeper valleys. // Scientists suspect that the camps here were occupied by entire families , rather than only by male hunters . But , according to Dr. Francoise Audouze of France ' s National Center for Scientific Research , who has worked at the sites , it has not been possible to demonstrate such occupancy. // Another mystery is the role of ocher , which tints much of the camp site grounds with a reddish hue . Did the hunters use it to paint their bodies red , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other purpose ? The tents are thought to have resembled Indian tepees , and efforts to reconstruct them indicate that covering each required about three dozen skins. // The culture was therefore heavily dependent on reindeer as well as on an abundant supply of flint to provide tools for hunting and processing the animals . According to Yvette Taborin of the University of Paris , it is not uncommon to find 20 , 000 to 30 , 000 discarded flints scattered around a tent site. // Flint was available in riverbeds throughout the Paris Basin , since the rivers cut through beds of limestone and chalk to flint layers underneath . There clearly were abundant large flint nodules near Etiolles , another of the Ice Age sites . Some of the nodules scientists have found there were 30 inches long and weighed 100 pounds . Obviously , they could not have been carried very far. // From them master craftsmen produced blades more than 20 inches long . Numerous discarded flints have been found , and scientists have been able in a surprising number of cases to retrieve and reassemble all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knecht , a graduate student at New York University who worked at Etiolles this past summer , microscopic study of such blades has shown no evidence that they were used. // Why they were stockpiled in such quantity after production remains unexplained , she said in a recent interview . She discounted the possibility that they were abandoned in the face of some sudden danger , since such complete assemblages have been found in layers widely separated in time. // Reassembly of the flints here and at Etiolles has made it possible to trace in detail the way the flint was worked . This , according to Dr. Audouze , has shown that craftsmen ' s work pattern was carefully designed to minimize wasted effort . " They always did minimum work for maximum results , " she said. // Because flint was abundant , a nodule was immediately thrown away if it was not top quality . Each nodule was shaped by stone hammer into a configuration that , when struck gingerly by an antler hammer , would shed a long blade of the desired shape . Periodically , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be reworked to provide the oblique angle needed for continued blade production. // A large stone near the central hearth at Pincevent , surrounded by flint chips , was presumably the seat of the master craftsman . Near the edge of the camp were stones surrounded by blades of poor quality and chips , probably the result of apprentices ' efforts. // Microscopic study has shown that each tool had an assigned use - cutting meat , gouging antler , scraping flesh from skin , removing its hair or drilling holes . For the last task " tool kits " may have been used , providing flints suited to successive stages of drilling and shaping. // Worn-out tools were often reworked to fulfill some other role . Blade marks on some of the bones testify to the way meat was carved . While most of the flint was local , a few tools made of flint from sources as much as 50 miles away have been found . There are no associated chips , indicating that they were worked elsewhere. // Heat-shattered fragments of stones were voluminous at the sites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones have been found around a single cooking hearth . After heating in a fire , the stones were presumably used to heat water for cooking by being placed in skin bags , their only vessels , that were filled with water. // Scientists have concluded that the camps were occupied from spring until early winter , based on the age of reindeer as shown by the state of tooth development in the remains . It is suspected that the hunters then retreated to more permanent settlements , none of which , however , has been found. // Whether the reindeer undertook great seasonal migrations like those of caribou in northern Alaska and Canada is uncertain . Bones found at sites in southern Germany have shown that most animals were killed in the fall , probably while migrating to lowlands from the Swabian Alps , but the Paris basin is far from any such mountains. // A half dozen living sites occupied in the Late Magdalenian Period , between 11 , 000 and 13 , 000 years ago , have been found in the Paris Basin . The one here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least a dozen tent sites were destroyed before the French Government acquired the land. // What followed was development of a new kind of archeology by Andre Leroi-Gourhan of the National Center for Scientific Research . He died early this year , but his many students are continuing the work here and elsewhere. // An essential feature of his method , after a " living floor , " where the hunters camped , cooked and made their tools , has been uncovered , is to carpet it with latex , forming a negative imprint that can then be removed , in sections , to form a plaster cast of the entire site . Once this has been done the artifacts can be collected for study and the site further excavated . Four layers of occupancy have been found here , although not directly atop one another. // Because large sections of the Pincevent living surfaces have been permanently preserved , it has become , in the words of Paul G. Bahn , archaeologist at the University of London , " one of the most important archaeological sites in the world. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted that the deposition of sediment by flood was so gentle that flint tools have been found still standing upright . Two eggs were preserved , crushed but still in place . He believes the site was occupied at least 10 times in the final centuries of the Magdalenien Period. // Virtually no works of art have been found , apart from one or two beads , perhaps because the hunters carried all their ornaments away with them . While bones of animals other than reindeer are extremely rare , the presence in several tent sites of single horse teeth implies that they were brought there for some special , possibly ritual , purpose. // Horse teeth and jaws have also been found deep within cave dwellings in the Pyrenees . A few bones of snowshoe hare , birds , fish and rodents have been identified here , as well as wolves who competed with human hunters for the reindeer . There are no remains of bison or wild cattle . From bones found in the tent sites it appears that reindeer heads , after cooking , were eaten inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , found intact , show that meat was removed from those parts of the carcass without disarticulating the skeleton - a practice used more than 10 , 000 years later by caribou hunters of the American far north . No human bones have been found , indicating that deaths occurred elsewhere or that the remains were disposed of away from the habitations. // Among ice age occupation sites found in the Paris Basin only five have living floors and hearths . At Verberie , according to Dr. Audouze , there are extensive bones , as at Pincevent , but microscopic study of wear marks on the flint tools shows the primary activity there , apart from meat processing , was carving bones and antlers. // At Pincevent , in addition to butchering reindeer , the emphasis was on working hides , especially dried hides . Etiolles , where 21 living floors have been found , seems to have been a tool-making center and may have existed earlier than Pincevent , since a mammoth pelvis was found there. // Dr. Audouze , asked recently if the inhabitants spoke a language , replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed education to learn flint knapping.
