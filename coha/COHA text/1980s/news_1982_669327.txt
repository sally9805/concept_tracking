He appears more an observer than a participant on this dark , cold afternoon with the 2 , 000 others marching down New York City ' s Seventh Avenue . It is a protest for Palestinian rights . And it is a protest against Israel. // Though Abu Isa is not chanting and his fist is not in the air , he is glad to be marching . It is his way of protesting . It is , in a sense , his duty . And the Palestinian is glad , too , for the realization that he is not alone in his support of the Palestinian fight for a homeland - even in the United States , Israel ' s strongest supporter. // And yet , Abu Isa is wearing sunglasses , even though the day is cloudy. // He is not the only one worried that someone might recognize him and take offense at his politics . Many of the demonstrators wear Arab headdresses , called kaffiyehs , wrapping them around their heads and covering their faces like Bedouins in a sandstorm . For Palestinian students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the occupied territories , there is concern that photographs and reports of their participation in pro-Palestinian or anti-Israeli activities might return to Israel before they do . Then they might be singled out by security agents at the airport when they return , or their families living in the Mideast might be harmed. // Many Palestinians living in America , where freedom of speech is guaranteed in the Constitution , feel it smarter to keep their mouths shut and avoid a possible confrontation . This is especially true in New York City , where the one of them opens his mouth to declare his commitment either on the job or in public , they feel that there is hostility and antagonism from other people in this town who disagree with their views , ' ' says Hassan Rahman , a Palestine Liberation Organization ( PLO ) diplomat in the US . ' ' Some of them feel they are being discriminated against ; some feel they are being intimidated , that they are being harassed . Some of them don ' t feel secure. ' ' // Of the estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 000 live in the New York metropolitan area . They are immigrants , students , diplomats , illegal aliens , and refugees who are building and maintaining a united community halfway around the world from their homeland . This task of keeping the Palestinians unified is being carried out in part through the circulation of literature and films by what they see as their government-in-exile , the PLO . Though the PLO is widely recognized as an umbrella organization including several guerrilla groups , PLO representatives at the United Nations insist they operate exclusively through nonviolent , diplomatic means. // Despite their acceptance of the PLO , most Palestinians living here are not the radical activists or machine-gun-toting terrorists many of their American neighbors suspect they are . They are more eager to lead relatively quiet and private lives and succeed economically than to openly battle the US government and American Jewish community . Palestinian businessmen strive to separate business from politics and leave the political statements to Arab students in US universities and PLO representatives at the UN. // The Palestinian-Americans are more refugees , in the true sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of the US economy , and they say they appreciate a system that rewards their hard work . But most believe that they can never become real Americans - that they must never become so Americanized as to forget their homeland. // This has become particularly true in recent weeks with the Israeli invasion of Lebanon and the siege and bombing of Beirut . Palestinians here are troubled that their tax dollars go in part toward aid to Israel - and that such aid helped finance the military pounding of the PLO . Some were so outraged at the Israeli invasion that they - like Palestinians in Europe and elsewhere - traveled to Lebanon to help their brothers fight . But they were only a minority . Most here , though committed to the cause , would rather not fight . They see their lives in the US as an interlude , a waiting time , in which to build a successful business and keep the family safe until they can return to a Palestinian state . Some dream of gaining enough economic influence in the US to challenge what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present , it is only a dream . The more serious challenges facing Palestinian-Americans are not in influencing the US Congress , but in being able to live their lives in America freely - without prejudice and harassment. // Palestinians in the New York City area must daily cope with the difficulties of being not only a racial minority , but also a political minority in a region they perceive as being dominated economically , socially , and politically by Jews . The difficulties range from Americans ' stereotyping of all Palestinians as terrorists to the fear of most Palestinians that they are under constant surveillance by the US and Israeli governments . They fear that making their opinions known or pressing the Palestinian issue , will bring reprisals against them , their businesses , or their families. // There have been isolated acts of violence in New York City against Palestinians , which - though infrequent - tend to confirm and feed their fears. // ' ' Sometimes you don ' t know who your enemy is , ' ' says Carlos Jbara , partner with his brother Sary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store - located adjacent to a kosher meat market and a half-block from a synagogue - was damaged Feb. 17 , 1981 , when a pipe bomb exploded near the front door early in the morning . The blast blew out the front windows of the store . No one was hurt. // Mr. Jbara , who hangs an 8-by-10-inch photograph of Yasser Arafat , the PLO leader , with the caption ' ' Palestine Will Win ' ' outside his showroom office , said he had no idea why his store was bombed . Two days after the incident , he said , he had the following telephone conversation with someone who identified himself as a member of the Jewish Defense League ( JDL ) , a New York-based extremist group that has in the past sometimes resorted to violence in its fight against anti-Semitism : // ' ' You don ' t know why your store was attacked twice this week ? ' ' the caller asked him . ' ' We ' re responsible , and you have to be nice because you don ' t like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says I don ' t like the Jew ? I ' ve been here seven years and I never attacked , or bothered , or insulted any Jews. ' ' // Then the line went dead , he said. // The JDL , formed in New York in 1968 to protest Soviet treatment of Jews , trains its members in karate and the use of weapons to defend themselves against anti-Semitism . The group , which has been rejected and condemned by mainstream Jewish organizations , has targeted Russians , Arabs , and members of the Black Panther organization for its demonstrations and harassment. // New York City detectives said that the bomb that exploded outside Mr. Jbara ' s store , a pipe filled with explosive powder and capped at both ends , was relatively small and easy to plant . There were no arrests. // A few days before the bombing , Jbara said someone moved a pile of rubbish next to the front window of his store and set it on fire . The window shattered because of the heat , he said , but there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his store was bombed. // The store owner added that two months before someone had written in large letters with red spray paint on the sidewalk in front of his store : ' ' PLO are murderers , ' ' ' ' PLO own the store , ' ' ' ' PLO must leave the US and New York , ' ' and ' ' PLO EQUALS ( a swastika ) . ' ' // In another incident on April 5 this year , a Lebanese restaurant in Brooklyn and apartments above it were destroyed by an arsonist . An elderly woman was killed in the blaze. // Moments after the first fire alarm sounded at 1 : 58 a. m. , an anonymous caller claiming he was with the JDL contacted the media and said the organization set the fire , because ' ' the Tripoli restaurant was the undercover headquarters in New York City of the Palestine Liberation Army. ' ' // A JDL spokesman denied the group was involved. // The police said they had no information linking the restaurant with the PLO. // While the Jbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of the majority of Palestinians here , the bombing , fire , and vandalism do have a larger impact on the Palestinian community . Word of the bombing and other acts travels quickly through the closed community in Palestinian coffee shops on Atlantic Avenue , Brooklyn , contributing to a wider fear that there may be further attacks. // The Palestinians in New York live a somewhat modified version of life in the Middle East . Many cling to the conservative ways and traditions of the ' ' old country , ' ' rejecting much of the American way of life . Palestinian fathers say they don ' t want their daughters growing up in designer jeans , drinking beer , and showing no respect for their elders . In fact , some Palestinian fathers - true to the rules of the old country - will not even permit a daughter to date unless she is formally engaged to the young man. // ' ' You ' d rather be dead than see your daughter go out with a guy . It ' s worse than a crime , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' We believe in that deeply . ( Palestinian women ) don ' t look for good times , going to discos and all that . They look to their husbands , their families , and their homes , ' ' he said. // It is a difficult standard to maintain , particularly in the New York City environment , and it has led to strains between young and old. // Many families have sent their daughters back to the Middle East when they reached age 12 or 13 to ensure that they were not ' ' corrupted ' ' by American society. // If there is one area in which the Palestinians do not fear their children will be corrupted it is regarding Israel and Palestinian rights . This is like a religion to them - taught to the children even before they are old enough to fully understand . As such , they develop a fairly sophisticated , but one-sided , understanding of the political situation in the Middle East at about the time their American counterparts are learning how to catch a baseball. // Although Palestinians are scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Atlantic Avenue area of Brooklyn . This is known as the Arab quarter for its Lebanese and Yemeni restaurants and Arab markets . Palestinians - businessmen , laborers , students , salesmen , seamen , and merchants - travel from all sections of the city evenings after work to drink Turkish coffee and sweet mint tea in the Arab cafes near Atlantic Avenue . They come to talk , argue , play cards , discuss politics , and , most important , to hear any news about family or friends in the Mideast. // It is a refuge - a tiny piece of Jerusalem or Hebron or Ramallah transplanted into Brooklyn . It is a place where a new immigrant can feel at home and where a group of American citizens can become Arabs again , talking freely and passionately in Arabic about whatever they want. // Abu Isa sits at a table near the entrance of Brooklyn ' s largest Palestinian cafe , dipping pita bread into a bowl of brown beans . He doesn ' t use a fork , rather he shapes the thin , flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eating as Arabs eat in the Middle East . He uses only his right hand . An Egyptian romance blares out in Arabic from the TV screen across the near-empty room. // A visitor enters - a stranger to the third-floor cafe . He asks questions about the Palestinians. // The old man tells the stranger he can not answer his questions . There are others , official people in Manhattan , who will , he says . He returns to his beans. // Someone else asks , ' ' Are you Jewish ? ' ' // The answer , ' ' No , ' ' elicits no visible response . It is a question frequently asked of strangers. // Later , more than three hours after the visitor entered the cafe , Abu Isa crosses the room and sits down . He is ready to talk . He looks more Italian than Palestinian , this short man in a turtle-neck with slicked-back hair and big , searching eyes. // ' ' The Jewish in America , you don ' t know if he is Jewish until you ask , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he keeps talking . This is a conversation he would not have with just anyone in New York City. // ' ' My people , they do not kill children , ' ' he says , ' ' We are peaceful people , quiet people , but where is our country , Palestine ? We did not sell it to the Jewish. // ' ' I was there in 1948 when the Jewish came to Deir Yasin . You know who the leader was , it was Menachem Begin , ' ' he says . ' ' They killed the women , they killed the children. // ' ' Everybody , he thinks about danger in that country with the Jewish , ' ' says Abu Isa . ( His name in Arabic means ' ' father of Jesus. ' ' ) // He leans over . He lowers his voice : ' ' Everything that happens here , Israel , she knows . Everything . Everything . Everything. ' ' // He adds , ' ' Palestine , 20 governments , they came and left and the Jewish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . ' ' He searches his vocabulary , and finally says , ' ' They came , and we were the people . Israel came by the army and by the planes - we are still Palestinian people. ' ' // //
