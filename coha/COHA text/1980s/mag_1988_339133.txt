What were once the ancestral lands of Washington State 's Puyallup Indians are now worth nearly $1 billion  --  the estimated value of downtown real estate , port facilities and private homes in the city of Tacoma ( pop . 160,000 ) . The tribe 's holdings , however , have been reduced to less than 100 acres , and unemployment among the 1,400 tribe members stands at 70% . <P> But in a deal negotiated by Senator Daniel Inouye , chairman of the Select Committee on Indian Affairs , the tribe has agreed to drop its claims to Tacoma in exchange for 900 acres of land and a trust fund that could generate as much as $10,000 annually for every adult , plus $61 million for a salmon fishery and a marine terminal . Each adult will also receive a $20,000 cash grant . Says Frank Wright , a Puyallup administrator : " Now we have something that is ours , something we can grab on to . "                   @ @
