Three weeks ago , at a White House breakfast with foreign policy experts , Jimmy Carter asked his guests whether they thought young Americans should once again be required to register for the draft-though not necessarily be drafted . To Carter 's surprise , practically everybody at the table , from George Ball to Eugene Rostow , said yes . Until then , the President had opposed a resumption of registration , but he found himself swayed by the arguments of his breakfast colleagues . As he worked on his State of the Union address at Camp David , Carter decided to include an announcement that the Selective Service System would be " revitalized . " To take this step , he felt , would show the world the seriousness of U.S. intentions in the midst of crises in the Middle East and Southwest Asia - and he probably was right . <P> An important reason behind the President 's announcement is the cold fact that the system of depending entirely on volunteers for the Army , in effect since 1973 , is not working well . Not enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the quality of recruits is falling off . In the event of war , the Army would need 100,000 inductees within two months and 650,000 within six months . But with the old draft boards out of action , the Pentagon figures it would take 110 days to get the first new recruits inducted into the armed services . That gap is supposed to be filled by the reserves , but those organizations are in no condition to shoulder so serious a responsibility . For instance , the Individual Ready Reserve , made up of those who have completed their active duty but are subject to quick call-up , numbers only 209,000 . The Army National Guard has 345,000 troops , well below its 418,000 objective . <P> The President did not attempt to spell out the new Selective Service procedures . He did not say whether the registration would involve only 18-to 26-year-olds , as during the Viet Nam era . Everyone in the age group would have to register . Administration officials did say that individuals would be able to sign up by going to a local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No draft cards would be issued , no classifications would be made , no physical exams required . <P> Most important , the President did not say whether the registration would include women . The subject is controversial , and especially explosive in an election year . Says a top Defense official : " Not only is the question not decided , it is wildly in flux . " The best guess is that Carter will stick to his guns on equal rights and ask for the registration of women as well as men . <P> To get the authority to register women , and to get the necessary $10 million to revive the Selective Service System , Carter will have to go to Congress , where the issue of registration is already sharply dividing opinion even within parties . Democratic Representative Elizabeth Holtzmann of New York said the President should " get tough with our allies , not our young people . " On the other hand , Democratic Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia declared that registration would " demonstrate a degree of will that has been lacking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
