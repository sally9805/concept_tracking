Dozens of warships steamed across the Bay of Naples , and , like precision swimmers , 85 submarines dived beneath the water , resurfacing eight minutes later in perfect formation to fire an eleven-gun tribute to their Nazi guest . It was a dazzling display from a master of spectacle , but like most other things Benito Mussolini did , this muscle flexing was little more than an act : two years later , after a few disastrous encounters with Britain 's Royal Navy , his impressive-looking fleet cowered in port , all but useless to the Germans . <P> If Hitler has gone down in history as the personification of evil , Mussolini has won his own immortality as the archetypal thug .

" The national flag is for us a rag to plant on a dunghill , " he wrote in the years before World War I when he was a strong internationalist . But Mussolini could believe almost anything passionately , and not long after a dispute led him to split with the Socialists , he established a new party , the Fascists , molding it along the lines of his own erratic and opportunistic temperament . As he described it , the party was " super-relativist , " with only one guiding light : Italy . " Our myth is the greatness of the nation , " he said , adding that it was the historical mission of an antiliberal elite to build and maintain that greatness . When he became Prime Minister in 1922 , after the famous March on Rome , he made it clear that to him greatness meant conquest .
