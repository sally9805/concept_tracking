" There were kids who promised things they could never deliver , " Andrew , a senior , said . " Like a soda machine or movies. " // " Pie in the sky , " is how he summed them up . Andrew wanted benches for the school grounds , mirrors for the bathrooms and toilet paper by the roll , rather than the sheet. // Now , as he nears the end of his term , he looks back with mixed emotions . The benches are on the way . But the mirrors were good only while they lasted . " You see the mirror put up by the custodian one day , and you ' re all happy , " he said , " and the next day , all you see is the hinges , or everyone ' s name on it. " // As for the toilet paper , that promise was abandoned . " If people can ' t handle a mirror , " Andrew said , " you can imagine all the things they ' d do with a roll of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the simplest thing can turn into a mess. " // For the longest time , the simplest things here turned into a protest . Beginning in the 1930 ' s with a student sitdown strike that ousted the Superintendent of Schools , Great Neck has often been a place for student activism , a Berkeley of Long Island. // Prof. Steven Kelman of Harvard remembers going from his senior year at Great Neck South in 1966 to his freshman year at Harvard , and being surprised that his college classmates were less sophisticated about Vietnam than his high school friends had been. // At first glance , from the list of offerings this year , it might appear that nothing has changed . There is still an alternative school within the school , where students design their courses . There is a club opposed to nuclear arms , and a black student union . Students elect representatives to several student-faculty committees. // Yet so much has changed . Scott Currie was the only student to show up for a meeting in January of the antinuclear weapons club . The black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler , a teacher , sees a sign of the change when he gives his annual lecture on " The Prince . " Each year the percentage of youngsters who agree with Machiavelli grows. // Not even alternative-school students sound alternative . One of them - Carolyn Trufelman , a senior - has this dream : " I want to go to graduate school . I want to get married . I want to have children . I want to live in Great Neck . I just want a typical Great Neck life. " // Students now tend to think of politics as something that goes on away from school . David Bomser , a senior , has formed a government club that travels to the East Queens Democratic Club to meet politicians . The student group has served as the host for speakers at school , including Governor Cuomo ' s wife , Matilda . <> <> A Chance to Protest // There was a time when everything about school was an opportunity for students to make a political statement . In 1972 , 65 seniors felt the yearbook was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portraits taken. // This year , only Scott Currie , a senior , resisted - and he changed his mind after the yearbook faculty adviser , Robert Shallow , asked him in a nice way. // In 1968 the Great Neck South seniors demanded a say in running the school . Today few students are interested in running for the student-faculty committees formed during those years . They feel it is naive to believe that anyone except the principal , Gilbert Blum , runs the school. // Most would probably agree with Gregory Bruell , a student government officer , who says students should give their opinion , and then let Mr. Blum decide . <> <> ' We Trust Him ' // // " Mr. Blum knows what he ' s doing , we trust him , " he said . " By putting all these students on all these committees , he insures that no one will not be happy. " // In December Mr. Blum decided that , as part of the back-to-basics movement , he would like to make final exams compulsory in all courses . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he did not put it to a vote. // " This was my decision , " Mr. Blum said , and no one thought to protest. // At Great Neck South there is still faculty support for alternative education and student activism . Because most students are indifferent , however , the roles have been reversed on those issues. // Today , it is the teachers - many of them products of the 1960 ' s - who ask the students of 1984 where their social consciousnesses and willingness to share have gone . <> <> The ' I ' Generation // // On a recent day , Frank Batemarco , a teacher , stood in the doorway of the alternative-school lounge and barred students . After trying unsuccessfully for six weeks to prod them into taking unified action to stop thefts from the lounge , he decided to close it. // " I , I , I , " he yelled . " That ' s all I hear around here is I. When is it going to be we ? " // He has had little luck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . And that , he says , has meant chaos for a program that is supposed to be run by student consensus. // Students argued with each other over issues such as whether to serve a meat or vegetarian menu for parents ' night. // During the holiday season , the students said they wanted to bring in gifts just for their friends , not for everyone , as past classes did . <> <> A Disappointed Enemy // // Even when they had a common enemy - the man who closed their lounge , Mr. Batemarco - they were still divided. // " I had hoped a group might come to me and say , ' We represent the students and we want to talk , ' " Mr. Batemarco said . " But all I ' ve had so far is four students come to me as individuals and say , ' I am taking the following unilateral action . ' I , I , I , I. " // During an after-school meeting , students could not agree on how to protest the lounge ' s closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too radical ; some were confused . A senior , Raelle Koota , explained her position this way : " I am responding the way I ' m going to do it , to the extent I ' m doing it . I don ' t want to be held back by others . " She said she was planning to " unilaterally boycott " everything but English , which she needs to graduate. // For years , seniors went on from Great Neck South to be activist leaders on college campuses . Carol Cohen , first in the class of ' 60 , was an early opponent of the Vietnam War at the University of Michigan with Tom Hayden ; Dale Rosen , first in the class of ' 65 , was with the students who occupied University Hall at Harvard in 1969. // In another era , Bruce Weiner , Kenny Moss and Scott Currie may have been political activists . They are , teachers say , students who think about changing the world . <> <> A New Kind of Activism // // In 1984 , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to raise money for cancer research . Kenny collected books to send to India . And Scott turned to punk rock. // Scott liked the working-class flavor of punk rock , and he appreciated groups such as the False Prophets for their songs on the dangers of nuclear weapons. // He was drawn by an antiauthority strain in him that , he says , he can not fully explain. // " Punk opened up a new world , something away from the straight and narrow , " said Scott , who is ranked second in the senior class . " I suppose I was uncomfortable that I was a little too well adjusted. " // He was pulled to the punk clubs of the East Village . He bought many punk albums and enjoyed spending time with the kind of person who was " nasty , snotty , the ultimate punk . " <> <> ' Like Stale Gum ' // // But by his senior year , he said , punk had lost its taste , " like stale gum . " He was turned off by what he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a year and then go to N.Y.U. " // He was offended by the lyrics of the most nihilistic groups , which sang that the working class was as rotten as everyone else . The movement , he said , became a fashion show populated by people who went to boutiques to buy " rape victim " T-shirts. // He feels he has learned from this . " It was the first time I realized you could have a lot of people , all doing the same thing , who didn ' t know what they were doing , " he said. // He says he has also learned this : " Why bother to shave your head if you know you ' re different ? " // Next year , he hopes to go to Harvard , where he was recently accepted , and study political science. //
