One who might consider taking out insurance , but who has not so far , is New York City Criminal Court Judge Alan Friess . Last year Friess was censured for inviting a woman murder suspect , whom he had released without bail , to stay overnight in his home with him and his girlfriend . Now Friess has touched off another minor furor . Faced with a repeat offender in a pickpocket case , Friess proposed a novel way to set the sentence . He offered the defendant the chance to toss a coin : heads for 30 days , tails for 20 . The coin came up tails . Friess 's flip approach piqued the district attorney . But the judge would not budge .
