The Presidency <P> The words and phrases of power fly like intercontinental missiles , finding targets both intended and accidental within minutes of launching . The analogy , mercifully , is inexact : declarations sometimes can be corrected in flight or even called back . Yet each year , in our taut environment of colliding political interests and swelling military arsenals , careless words grow more dangerous and create an alarming impact on strained alliances or suspicious adversaries . <P> A large part of international politics today is a ritual followed by 50 or so men and women around the globe trying to figure out each morning what their counterparts in other nations are truly thinking . From these deductions , armies are massed and shifted , resources expended and freedoms enlarged or restrained . <P> The failure to understand fully the importance of the precise use of language in discussing the exercise of power has been a grave weakness of all the recent American presidential pretenders . Two weeks ago , Ronald Reagan was trying to put his China genie back in the bottle . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into trouble , and at one point in a press conference argument about having government-to-government relations with Taiwan , Reagan confessed : " I do n't know . I do n't know that I said that or not , ah , I , I really do n't . " When his running mate George Bush offered , " He did not say that , " a relieved Reagan piped up , " George says I did n't say it . " In fact , Reagan did say it ( that we should have " governmental " relations with Taiwan ) , and he said it in an almost offhand manner in Cleveland several months ago . <P> For nearly four years now the world has suffered from the same kind of indiscriminate musings of Jimmy Carter , whether on having neighborhoods of " ethnic purity , " or providing the Palestinians a " homeland , " or declaring that his friendship with the Shah of Iran was " irreplaceable . " These fellows who come out of the movie business or peanut warehouses-amateurs , if you will-naturally carry a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all people , they are products of their environment , harboring folklore from parents , favorite uncles , teachers , and books they have read . Some of it is fresh and good . Much of it is half-baked , naive and wrong . <P> What they rarely calculate is that when they become serious contenders for the presidency they enter a special world in which almost everything they say becomes the basis for a judgment by someone , somewhere on their policy or on themselves as leaders . Governors , Senators and Congressmen can say almost anything that comes to mind ( and very often do ) with little fear of its upsetting national aspirations . Let them battle their way up to the plateau of running for the presidency and everything changes . The degree to which they deliberate every issue before they speak and then think through every utterance is a critical measure of their competence .
