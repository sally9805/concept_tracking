In New York , the first of a Kandinsky trilogy <P> The Russian artist Vasily Kandinsky ( 1866-1944 ) casts a long shadow over modern art . His career took him to most of its centers : Munich before World War I , Russia , and next a long sojourn at the Bauhaus in Germany during the 1920s , then a last expatriation to Paris after the rise of Hitler . If ever a painter carried his culture in one portable labyrinth on his back , as if he were a rambling snail , it was Kandinsky . And while he did not invent abstract art on his own ( as he and his admirers were given to claim ) , he certainly did more to promote the notion of ideal abstraction , in those distant years before World War I , than any other European artist . <P> Such a life , woven through so many cultural milieus , is not easily condensed into one retrospective show . The Guggenheim Museum in New York has set out to describe it in three parts , the first of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now on view . It is focused , not exclusively on the text of Kandinsky 's own paintings , but on their context as well . What did he see in Munich ? What did he get from other artists ' work ? The exhibition , closely and intelligently curated by Art Historian Peg Weiss , is therefore largely about the Jugendstil , or youth-style-the art-nouveau porridge of medievalism , forest fantasies , greenery-yallery decor and arts-and-crafts utilitarianism that was cooking in the Munich studios when Kandinsky made his late start as a 30-year-old art student therein 1896 . <P> Later exhibitions will deal with Kandinsky at the Bauhaus and in Paris . By 1985 , presumably , the Guggenheim Museum will have fulfilled its destiny as the St. Peter 's of Kandinsky studies . That is fitting enough , since the museum is ( so to speak ) built over the ruins of a shrine that housed his cult in the 1940s . This was the Museum of Non-Objective Painting , set up and run by Solomon Guggenheim 's mistress , the Baroness Hilla Rebay , who-in her dottily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her purported Nazi sympathies-was for a time the Winifred Wagner of the New York art world . The Museum of Non-Objective Painting , complete with piped-in organ music , was devoted to the baroness 's idea that Kandinsky was the messiah , sent to save all culture , with Paul Klee as his attendant apostle . <P> The idea that such a transcendent being might have had a context would have been anathema to the baroness , but her collection became the core of the Guggenheim Museum . Meanwhile , the blazing torch of devotion has turned into a curatorial flashlight , poking abruptly here and there amid the somewhat musty recesses of the Jugendstil . Such are the sorrows of no longer believing that art and religion are the same thing .
