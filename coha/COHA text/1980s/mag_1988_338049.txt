Michael Dukakis ' career has been marked by a supreme self-sufficiency . As Governor , he has tended to keep his own counsel . When asked to name his boss 's five or six closest advisers , a Dukakis aide said , " Some people might argue that there are n't five or six . " But in recent years Dukakis has learned , if only by necessity , to rely on a wider group . As the campaign gathers momentum , the outlines of a Dukakis brain trust are taking shape . <P> A stint in Cambridge helps gain admittance . In fact , some aides openly worry about the appearance of a Harvard mafia . The Governor 's closest confidant is his Harvard Law School roommate Paul Brountas . As campaign chairman , Brountas , 56 , is a lot like the candidate , always erring on the side of caution . But when staffers want to make a special appeal to Dukakis , they usually do it through his old friend . Should Dukakis win in the fall , Brountas , a senior partner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Attorney General . <P> Campaign Manager Susan Estrich , 35 , is likely to be part of any Administration . A former Harvard Law Review president and Supreme Court clerk who is on leave as a professor at the law school , Estrich took over the campaign during the turmoil after John Sasso 's resignation . Another 35-year- old Harvard Law School professor , Christopher Edley , has done an outstanding job as the campaign 's issues director . The top-ranking black on the Governor 's team , Edley could wind up as chief domestic-policy adviser . Standing in the wings is Sasso , the mastermind of the campaign , who left after distributing the Joseph Biden " attack video " last fall . From his office at a Boston advertising agency , Sasso has kept in touch with the candidate . Should Dukakis go all the way to the White House , Sasso is likely to follow , perhaps as chief of staff . <P> Jack Corrigan , 31 , who has worked for Dukakis seven years , is a talented , tough-minded operator who set up the candidate 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant shadow on the campaign trail , is an earthy , good-natured pol . A former associate director of Harvard 's Institute of Politics , Mitropoulos became the Governor 's director of personnel . As head of Dukakis ' department of revenue , Ira Jackson , 39 , a former associate dean of Harvard 's John Fitzgerald Kennedy School of Government , was largely responsible for Dukakis ' highly touted tax-collection efforts . If Jackson could be lured away from his job at the Bank of Boston , he could fill a top position at the Treasury or the Office of Management and Budget .
