THE HUNTING OF THE SNARK by Lewis Carroll <P> Annotated by Martin Gardner ; William Kaufmann ; $18.95 <P> LEWIS CARROLL : A CELEBRATION edited by Edward Guiliano ; Potter ; $17.95 <P> On July 18 , 1874 , a shy Oxford don visited his sisters at Guildford , in the south of England . There , part of a poem came to mind . It was only eight words long , but the phrase would haunt generations : " For the Snark was a Boojum , you see . " Charles Dodgson subtitled his completed work " An Agony in Eight Fits , " but it is really the final volume of an unintended trilogy , a trip to Wonderland without Alice . <P> She is scarcely missed . Here Dodgson , again under the nom de plume Lewis Carroll , is in full control of his genius . Gone is the Victorian treacle , the sentiment that seeped through his earlier writings . In its place is a premonitory feeling of dread . As always in Carrolliana , logic lies on one side and absurdity on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spark , illuminating the strange journey of an impossible crew ( nine men whose occupations begin with B , plus a Beaver ) in search of an inconceivable creature . It will ultimately consume one of them . At the end , there is no convenient awakening from a dream , as in Alice 's adventures , no consolation of an afterlife . All that remains is " a torrent of laughter . . . Then , silence . " The Hunting surfaces in Finnegans Wake and powerfully influenced T.S . Eliot . Auden compared it with Moby Dick and advanced it as a metaphor for " mankind and human society moving through time and struggling with its destiny . " <P> Yet in recent years , the Snark has been as hard to find in bookstores as it was on the ocean . The hard-cover book has been out of print for a decade . Now , on the occasion of Charles Dodgson 's sesquicentennial , the matter has been rectified with Martin Gardner 's frabjous Annotated Snark . In its oversized , endlessly informative pages , Gardner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhymes and references and brightens the strange engravings of Henry Holiday . The choice of Holiday , Gardner says , was a classic Carrollian irony . In his day ( circa 1870 ) the illustrator was renowned as a designer of stained-glass windows , among them a Crucifixion and Ascension that still stand at the Church of the Holy Trinity in Manhattan . <P> Today he is remembered chiefly because of some whimsical decorations for a nonsense epic . Although he lacks the spidery draftsmanship of Sir John Tenniel , who brought the Alice books to life , Holiday lends the tale an ominous air and a sense of open-ended allegory . <P> What is one to make , for example , of the Beaver and the Butcher as " They returned hand-in-hand , and the Bellman , unmanned/ ( For a moment ) with noble emotion , / Said ' This amply repays all the wearisome days/ We have spent on the billowy ocean ! ' " Or : " ' I engage with the Snark-every night after dark-/ In a dreamy delirious fight : / I serve it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for striking a light : ' "
