 | When Donald F. Glut speaks , his lips are synchronized with his words , but otherwise he might have stepped out of a Godzilla movie . The California writer seems awestruck by the kindhearted monster who can do incredible ' i. things like breathe fire and make Raymond Burr ( costar of the original 1956 " Godzilla " ) look like a 42 regular . Glut , 42 , shares his Burbank bachelor pad with a 15-foot-high bust of the Tokyo-based tyrannosaur , a pet turtle named for Godzilla 's rival Gamera and , when he turns on his porch light of a summer evening , dozens of little Mothras . Poring over his collection of Godzilla dolls , posters , coin banks , cigarette lighters and squirt guns , Glut feels as rich as Rockefeller or even Henry G. Saperstein , the president of UPA Productions and the man who holds all merchandising rights for Godzilla in the Western world . Yes , it is good to be Henry G. Saperstein when so many Americans are following in the $25 fuzzy Godzilla bedroom-slipper prints of Donald @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles with Megalon , The Smog Monster and The Thing ? Well , if you thought those guys were out to get Godzilla you have n't seen the shoppers at the Forbidden Planet in New York City snapping up Godzilla bathroom toys for $5.25 ? or the people at a Los Angeles boutique called Wacko who pay $150 for a 21-inch plastic statue commemorating the monster 's 30th birthday . What 's with kids today ? A good question , but it 's mostly adults who are buying the little Godzillas that blow bubbles , spit sparks or perch on an ashtray and pee on your cigarette . " One lady came in to buy a Godzilla item for her 40-year-old son , " says Darrell McCabe , manager of a Houston gift shop called Sheer Insanity . Meanwhile in Austin , 41-year-old Jim Hughes , owner of the Atomic City toy store , has had a " tribute to Godzilla " tattooed across his back . Selling a song : Unfortunately , he did n't add " Born to Raise Godzooki " ( referring to Godzilla 's only son ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opportunity : in the past year Godzilla has endorsed Dr Pepper , Konica Film , Hallmark Greeting Cards and Scope mouthwash . His likeness has been used in New York City department-store window displays . And earlier this month , as if to prove that he could sell a song , too , the monster made his MTV debut in an Adam Ant video . The casual observer may find all this baffling ? and anyone who sat through last year 's " Godzilla ' 85 " will be flummoxed completely . Even enthusiast Glut admits that the 17th and latest movie " committed the cardinal sin of being dull . " Still , he can see , behind those red eyes , not just an Oriental extra who probably once dreamed of knocking ' em dead in the No theater , but a monster right for these times . @# " People have OD 'd on robots , all the Star Wars ' things , " Glut says . " They 're looking for something different . " Producer Saperstein sees Godzilla as a Stallone with scales . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He comes from his prehistoric grave only when peace or the ecology is threatened . The movies are really morality plays . " That may sound highfalutin for a hero whose tragic flaw is that he trips over department stores . In his native Japan , though , the King of the Monsters has always been taken a bit more seriously . Some scholars , in fact , see the original " Godzilla " as a reaction to the A-bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki . " If you look at newsreel footage taken after the blast , of nurses treating victims in the street , " says Glut , " it 's similar to the scenes of Godzilla 's victims . " If an exorcism of horror was the original intent , though , that was quickly forgotten as the film studio Toho Co . Ltd. stumbled upon a simple good-versus-bad formula that appealed to Japanese juveniles and middle-aged American men . Pairing two passions of the post-40 set , a Japanese importer has introduced a female Godzilla doll that wears satin bunny ears , carries a tray of plastic drinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It costs $4.50 and makes purists so angry they could hit something . How ' bout a Godzilla bop-'em bag ? ? $7.50 . As for the Japanese , they are not offended . " The Godzilla boom has passed and things are quiet for now , " says a Toho executive . The hot item in Tokyo this summer is a sweat shirt featuring Mickey Mouse .
