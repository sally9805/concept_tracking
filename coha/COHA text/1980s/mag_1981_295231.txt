Just a year ago , in the early evening of Nov. 4 , 1980 , a good hour or two before he had to , Jimmy Carter telephoned his congratulations to Ronald Reagan . By the next afternoon Carter was telling reporters he was confident " history " would rate his presidency more highly than the election returns might momentarily suggest . This is a theme Carter has pursued with visitors in Plains this year , and it is a fair guess it animates the memoirs he is writing . No President defeated for reelection , so far as is known , has ever felt differently . Even before he lost in 1912 , William Howard Taft put it well : " By and by the people will see who is right and who is wrong . " <P> Presidents who win re-election care just as deeply about their place in history . For them it is not a matter of vindication-they have no reason to question the good judgment of the electorate-but rather a reach for the ultimate goal of greatness . <P> There are some difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unfortunate probability that he will not live long enough to hear what history has to say . But his children will , and " the nation , " and that is something . <P> On the day he leaves office , a President 's place in history depends heavily on some history that has n't happened yet . In midsummer of 1981 , for instance , when Reagan had just won his dazzling legislative victories on taxes and the budget , Jimmy Carter-if anybody was thinking about him at all-probably seemed an even more ineffectual President than so many voters had thought in 1980 . By November 1981 , however , Reagan was beginning to get mussed up on his economic program , and Carter 's reputation was up a bit . So it will go all through Reagan 's years and on into one or two of his successors ' Administrations . As these Presidents do well or badly with inflation , the Soviets , etc. , Carter 's rating will fluctuate , not all the way off the chart , but somewhere between " unsuccessful " and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
