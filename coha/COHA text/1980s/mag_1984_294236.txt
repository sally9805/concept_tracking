Challenger 's astronauts complete a historic repair mission <P> Trailing streaks of vaporized gas , with the dawn light glinting on its white thermal coating , space shuttle Challenger swooped over the sun-baked mountains of California 's Mojave Desert late last week for a perfect , centerline landing . Indeed , the touchdown was what shuttle pilots approvingly call a wow WONG ( weight on wheels , weight on nose gear ) . As the 98-ton orbiter rolled to a stop on the seven-mile-long , hard-baked desert runway at Edwards Air Force Base , mission control radioed a heartfelt " Welcome back ! " <P> The finale of the shuttle 's eleventh and most ambitious mission was supposed to have taken place at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida , site of the launch . But just as Shuttle Commander Bob Crippen and his crew prepared to descend from orbit and end their seven-day , more-than-2 million-mile flight , storm clouds began gathering near Cape Canaveral , complicating Challenger 's descent . The California touchdown will force NASA to transport Challenger back across the U.S. to Florida and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mission . The trip across the continent will delay Shuttle Mission 12 , scheduled for June 19 , by a week or more . <P> But those problems were largely forgotten as Challenger ' s five-man crew stepped down the ramp from their cabin into the 42 desert morning . The focus was still on their historic achievements . Shuttle Mission 41-C had written a new and vital chapter in the use of the space vehicle and confirmed the ability of astronauts and sophisticated machinery to work in on-site weightlessness . <P> <P> The voyage may have ended in triumph , but its early stages were marred by uncertainties : a critical hardware failure ; a dangerously wobbling satellite ; minute-by-minute calculations of depleted fuel ; and a pulse-pounding race against dying batteries that threatened to set back the space program 's future . <P> NASA 'S carefully detailed script for the mission was showy but simple . Its highlight was to be a free-floating walk in space to retrieve the ailing Solar Maximum Mission satellite ( Solar Max ) . Sent aloft to monitor the sun 's activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten months in orbit . Challenger 's mission last week was to stop the rotation of Max , use the spacecraft 's 50-ft. remote-controlled arm to lift the satellite into the ship 's cargo bay , and set it back in orbit after repairs were made . <P> The celestial service call , if successful , would mean a saving of $185 million over the cost of replacing Max . It would be a technical and psychological boost for NASA 'S program of future maintenance on other orbiting machinery and a giant step toward fulfilling one of President Reagan 's commitments : to construct a permanent U.S. space station by the early 1990s . <P> The curtain for the 106 - orbit flight went up with a glitch-free liftoff . For the first tune , Challenger hurtled directly into orbit instead of making the conventional three-part ascent . The lineal climb was designed to save the craft 's maneuvering rocket fuel for the tricky rendezvous with Max.
