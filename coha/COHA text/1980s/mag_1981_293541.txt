HOUSEKEEPING by Marilynne Robinson Farrar , Straus &; Giroux 219 pages ; $10.95 <P> Most small American towns have at least one : the " odd " house that everyone knows and gossips about , the old place going to seed on the outside while a hidden , perhaps unimaginable life transpires behind drawn shades or yellowing lace curtains . A home haunted by its occupants fascinates the neighbors and many , many writers ; the phenomenon crops up from Poe to Faulkner to Harper Lee and beyond . That last category now includes Author Marilynne Robinson . Her unsettling first novel deals with the fall of yet another house , but from an unusual vantage . The story is told by an insider who helps pull down the roof . <P> Ruth Stone and her younger sister Lucille are deposited as small children at their grandmother 's house in Fingerbone , an isolated community somewhere in Idaho . The girls ' mother then drives a borrowed car Into the nearby lake and joins her father , who had drowned there years earlier . Ruth remembers : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me the habit of waiting and expectation which makes any present moment most significant for what it does not contain . " Fingerbone ( " a meager and difficult place " ) and the vast Northwest surrounding it give the growing girl plenty of emptiness to ponder . <P> When their grandmother dies , care of the castaway daughters eventually falls to their Aunt Sylvie , who comes back to Fingerbone from whereabouts and husband unknown . She is a gentle , oddly weatherless woman who poses no threat in the way of harshness or undue discipline . The girls like her , and worry : " Lucille and I still doubted that Sylvie would stay . She resembled our mother , and besides that , she seldom removed her coat , and every story she told had to do with a train or a bus station . " The three settle into a land of amiable anarchy . They eat what and when they please : " Sylvie liked cold food , sardines aswim in oil , little fruit pies in paper envelopes . " Leaves and debris gather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , magazines , tin cans and bottles begin mounting in the parlor . <P> Sylvie glides effortlessly into ever more erratic behavior . She spends mesmerized hours staring into the lake that claimed her father and sister . She studies the local freightyard and checks on the hobos and transients riding through . The girls find her one day asleep on a bench near the center of town , a newspaper propped over her face . At home she falls into long silences , plays solitaire during the day and comes alive at night , keeping the lights out and letting the darkness in : " Sylvie in a house was more or less like a mermaid in a ship 's cabin . She preferred it sunk in the very element it was meant to exclude . " <P> Lucille finally senses how peculiar the three of them look to the town and escapes from " Sylvie 's dream , " moving in with a lonely but respectable schoolteacher . Ruth stays , increasingly convinced that " we are the same . She could as well be my mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have Sylvie declared unfit to raise her . When the success of this crusade seems assured , the aunt and niece decide to keep their house no longer .
