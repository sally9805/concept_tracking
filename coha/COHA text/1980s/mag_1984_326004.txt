Chemistry of a Name <P> Her opponent campaigns aggressively in bowling alleys and at factory gates . She prefers cozy chats in private homes , where 30 or so guests can listen to her speech while munching on tuna sandwiches and fruitcake . Republican Elise du Pont , 48 , wife of retiring Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV , is seeking her first elected office by running for Delaware 's sole House seat against the Democratic incumbent Tom Carper . Most observers think that the former housewife 's fortune and famed last name give her a strong chance of winning . She insists rather plaintively that this view works against her . <P> The Du Pont wealth stems from the chemical company that is the state 's largest employer . Initially , Elise du Pont was so eager to dispel the notion that she was riding on her husband 's coattails and checkbook that her campaign billboards advertised her only as " Elise . " When voters failed to respond , campaign strategists added her surname . Even though her husband has studiously stayed away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pierre du Pont , completing his second term , has an approval rating of some 90% .

" <P> Elise du Pont , educated at Miss Porter 's School and Bryn Mawr , entered politics late in life , having raised four children before she started law school in Philadelphia at age 40 .

Rich , well bred and painstakingly polite , Du Pont hopes to coast in on the President 's popularity in the conservative state . She has been coached on tax cuts and the balanced-budget amendment by G.O.P. Supply-Siders Jack Kemp and Newt Gingrich . <P> In contrast , Carper relishes his non-U public-school background .

" Carper , who supported Gold water in 1964 , is a fiscal conservative who is bullish on defense . On most issues , the two candidates appear to agree . Carper is gambling that his experience and folksy manner will play well against Du Pont 's gilded edges . <P> Sheriff vs . Schoolmarm <P> They are such improbable rivals that even a TV sitcom writer might be embarrassed to cast them . A prim , perky Republican , Judy Petty , 41 , teaches Sunday school and on occasion has lectured schoolgirls on etiquette . Her Democratic opponent in the close race for Arkansas ' Second Congressional District is Tommy Robinson , 42 , a roughhewn , tough-talking sheriff who once suggested that a bounty hunter be sent to the Soviet Union to bring back the man who last year shot down the KAL airliner. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
