MIDDLE EAST Birth of a Nation Boast not thyself of to morrow ; for thou knowest not what a day may bring forth . <P> - Proverbs 27:1 <P> Between one pink dawn and another over the Moabite hills last week came The Day . It brought forth events sufficient to crowd aside the worries of tomorrow . To the Jews of Palestine this day brought a state of their own , the first in 1,878 years . To the British it brought the loss of a 10,460-square-mile base in the Mediterranean-and relief from a burden they had snatched up with imperial optimism 31 years ago . To the Arabs , it brought a tautening of determination and a more sober assessing of their chances for victory . <P> Shortly after sunrise on May 14 , the Union Jack flapped down from its staff over Government House , on Jerusalem 's Hill of Evil Counsel . Without farewells from Jew or Arab , the British Governor General , tired-looking General Sir Alan Gordon Cunningham , flew to Haifa in an R.A.F. plane . There , at 10:05 a.m. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the light cruiser Euryalus . On the dock , a bagpiper skirled the melancholy tune of The Minstrel Boy . Precisely at midnight , the Euryalus passed the three-mile limit of Palestine 's territorial waters . From Royal Navy headquarters atop Mount Carmel a flare shot up , arched slowly , and fell flaming among the tall dark cypresses on the mountain slope . The British mandate had ended . <P> A few hours after Cunningham left the docks at Haifa , 400 Jews gathered at the Tel Aviv Museum under the watchful eyes of Haganah Bren-gunners . The 13 men who would rule the new Jewish state sat down at a long table on a raised dais . Over their heads were white Zionist flags bearing two pale blue stripes and a blue Star of David . The assemblage rose to sing the Zionist anthem Hatikvah- " The ancient longing will be fulfilled , to return to the land . . . of our fathers . . . " <P> A stocky man with a halo of electric white hair , dressed in a light blue suit and tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers , looked frequently at his watch . On the dot of 4 p.m. , David Ben-Gurion , first Prime Minister of the Jewish state , banged the table with his fist and began to read . As he reached the words proclaiming " the establishment of the Jewish State in Palestine , to be called Israel , " * the audience cheered and wept . <P> In the two hours that remained before sundown , when the Jewish Sabbath would begin , Tel Aviv 's jubilant people danced in the streets , paraded with blue- &-white; streamers and Star of David flags , prayed in their synagogues , with tears and cheers waved off truckloads of Haganah youths headed for the frontiers . <P> Unhindered now by the British , the refugee ship Andria brought 360 immigrants into Haifa . Other ships brought war supplies to Tel Aviv . The new government announced its adherence to the principles of the U.N . Charter . At 21 minutes past midnight , Palestine time , President Truman announced : " The U.S. Government recognizes the provisional government as the de facto authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
