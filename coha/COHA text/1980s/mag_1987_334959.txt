Stepping in front of a live audience all alone is a pressure-packed moment for any stand-up comedian , but no one seems to handle it worse than Bob Goldthwait . Wavering between what appears to be incapacitating stage fright and drug-induced hysteria , Goldthwait delivers his lines in a choked , trembling voice that regularly erupts into shrieks of agony . " Thank you very . . . thank you very . . . thaaaarrrrgggghhhh ! " were the first words from his mouth in a recent HBO special taped at Manhattan 's Bottom Line . Two or three more half-finished sentences followed , then an angry shout of defiance : " I never masturbated in my life ! " <P> " Crazy time " is what Johnny Carson calls it when the comedy gets a bit weird on the Tonight show . But the real crazies rarely make it to Carson 's stage . Goldthwait did have one Tonight appearance a year ago , when Joan Rivers was guest host , and some of his offbeat contemporaries can occasionally be seen in such hipper network venues as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But increasingly , the showcase for innovative comic talent is cable , the Off-Broadway of TV comedy . <P> Cable 's pay channels  --  primarily HBO , Showtime and Cinemax  --  early on discovered comedy as a fertile source of original programming . With no network censors to contend with , stand-up comics had virtually free rein in language and subject matter . Comedy concerts featuring everyone from Rodney Dangerfield to Eddie Murphy quickly became staples of the cable schedule . Comedy series inevitably came next . Some , like Showtime 's Brothers and HBO 's 1st &; Ten , have been only marginally different from routine network fare . But HBO 's Not Necessarily the News , now in its fifth year , offers welcome dollops of topical ( if frequently toothless ) political satire . Freshest of all is the engaging It 's Garry Shandling 's Show on Showtime , an unexpected hit that has just won a renewal for three more years . Meanwhile , the Cinemax Comedy Experiment has served as the umbrella for an array of inventive comedy specials . The best so far this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliches of two TV genres , private-eye dramas and sitcoms , by yoking them into one ludicrously mismatched half hour . <P> The budding stars of cable 's alternative comedy scene , however , are a new group of performers who are pushing the limits of the stand-up genre . Traditional stand-up comedians , from Alan King through Jay Leno , have usually presented themselves as normal folks , people like you and me who happen to have funny things to say about dating or television or life in New York City . The new gang appear onstage as determined misfits  --  sometimes menacing , sometimes pathetic , always glaringly out of place . One of the quirkiest is Emo Philips , 31 , a waiflike creature with a Prince Valiant haircut who floats onto the stage like some fugitive from Mother Goose and talks in a limp , languorous singsong . The star of a recent HBO concert , he shows a fondness for whimsical absurdities ( " I 'm not as good a swimmer as I used to be  --  thanks to evolution " ) , but his material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his presentation .
