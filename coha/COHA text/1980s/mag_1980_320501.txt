A powerful case can be made that in a society heavily mulched with gossip journalism , novelized movies , campaign biographies , airline magazines , the printed bafflegab of lawyers and academics , interviews with pious athletes and pouting ads by misunderstood oil companies , the affliction called writer 's block is insufficiently widespread . But no wretch who has ever tried to write anything will be surprised to learn that Nancy Isaac Kuriloff , a therapist who works in Los Angeles and deals with fear of writing , has plenty of clients . <P> &#quot; We are really talking about peril , " Kuriloff says in the living room of her Brentwood apartment . She is an intense , frail-looking , girlish woman of 39 who moves about when she speaks , dashing to the bookshelf to verify a remembered fragment of poetry , changing chairs to find one whose compass bearing on the conversation is exactly right . When she listens , she cocks her head , nods emphatically - " Yes , yes , yes ! " - leans forward in sympathy , sits back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just now she is describing a ghastly scene , the desolate interior landscape of the becalmed writer . This bedeviled soul feels stupid , worthless , paralyzed ; he is in a state of panic and isolation ; he feels a terrible sense of impending disaster . " And in this situation the Critic is remorseless . " That is Kuriloffs central perception : most people who write anything at all must deal , sooner or later , with a hostile , censorious inner voice . It will say , for example , " You must finish , and you do n't have enough time . " Or " You ca n't do it , you 're no good , and everyone will find out .

In college she was an expert player of the academic game , a great winner of praise and fellowships . Such accomplishments did not prevent her from feeling , as she once wrote , that each writing assignment was " a blankness , a barrier , a kind of enemy . " She bested her enemy often enough to be able to do well as a teacher of writing at Berkeley , U.C.L.A. and Caltech . But she slowly began to transform her English courses into experiments in overcoming fear of writing . By 1975 she was calling herself a writing consultant , though she is not happy with that nondescription . A brief announcement in the Los Angeles Times of a two-part workshop on fear of writing set her phone ringing . Workshop led to workshop . Wounds healed .
