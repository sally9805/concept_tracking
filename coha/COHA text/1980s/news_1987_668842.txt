The heaviest rainfall in Chicago history , beginning late Thursday and extending well beyond the morning rush hour , caused havoc in the Chicago area Friday , snarling traffic , flooding basements and highways and making life generally miserable for hundreds of thousands . That ' s the bad news . The worse news is that more rainstorms , possibly as severe as the Thursday-Friday deluge , were predicted for Friday night and Saturday . The storm ' s effects were as staggering as the statistics it set . By 10 a. m . Friday , the all-time 24-hour rainfall record of 6. 24 inches had been broken in just a little more than 12 hours , when a total of 8. 98 inches was recorded at O ' Hare International Airport , according to the Central Weather Service . The record was set July 12 and 13 , 1957 . According to the National Weather Service conversion formula , if the rainfall had been snowfall , the city and northern suburbs would have had nearly 90 inches of snow , almost as much as during the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accumulate that amount . The North Side and western and northern suburbs were hit hardest . For example , by midmorning , Arlington Heights had measured 7. 5 inches in the 12- hour period , while south suburban Lockport had only . 03 of an inch . In Chicago , 3. 05 inches were recorded by the Metropolitan Sanitary District at its measuring station at Erie Street and Michigan Avenue , but only . 43 of an inch fell at 87th Street and Western Avenue . Although there were periodic thunder and lightning outbursts during the storm  --  which eased off , at least temporarily , by noon Friday  --  the primary villain was rain , rain and more rain , which turned expressways into lakes and basements into swimming pools . Just about everything designed to move Friday didn ' t . Those who took cars to work soon wished they hadn ' t . Some commuters found it took hours to negotiate flooded suburban streets and viaducts only to find that portions of the Edens and Kennedy Expressways were closed by waters as high as six feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed at times because of deep water . At Addison Street and the Kennedy Expressway , six feet of water was on the roadway , and the Chicago Transit Authority was forced to close its rapid- transit station because of flooding there . The Kennedy also was closed just outside of O ' Hare International Airport , choking off the traffic flow into the airport and locking others inside . Inside the airport , however , things weren ' t going much better . " It ' s a mess right now , " said Kenneth Jackson , deputy tower chief at O ' Hare at midmorning Friday . During the early-morning hours , landings were restricted to one runway and departures to another . Normally , at least two arrival and two departure runways are in operation . Although rainfall was much lighter at Midway Airport on the city ' s South Side , the airport still was forced to close for about an hour . At Meigs Field on the city ' s lakefront , the airport was open , but there was little activity because most pilots of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who decided not to stay home sometimes took as long as five or six hours to complete their trips into the downtown area , and others were still stranded along the still-closed Kennedy Expressway by Friday afternoon . Others decided to just forget it and turned around and went home . On the Kennedy Expressway immediately north of Addison Street , commuting turned into anarchy as dozens of motorists , seeing cars ahead flooded nearly to their rooftops , made abrupt U-turns from the southbound lanes and illegally returned north , seeking ramps at Irving Park Road and Montrose Avenue to exit the flooded expressway . If things were tough for those on the rails and roadways , they weren ' t any better for those left behind to contend with flooded basements , yards and streets . And the biggest " basement " of them all , the Metropolitan Sanitary District ' s Deep Tunnel system , currently 50 miles of tunnels and reservoirs , was filled to its 1-billion-gallon capacity brim by 3 a. m . Friday , forcing the district to open its locks at Wilmette . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gallons of storm water had been dumped into Lake Michigan from the Wilmette locks . About 9 : 30 a. m. , complaints by downtown Chicago businesses that they too were suffering flooded basement forced the sanitary district to open the locks at the Chicago River entrance to the lake . Earlier in the morning , the river level reportedly was as much as five feet higher than usual , and the popular Wendella sightseeing boats suspended operations for the first time in two years because they could not get under the various Chicago River bridges in downtown Chicago . Du Page County Board Chairman Jack Knuepfer signed an emergency declaration at 9 a. m . Friday giving the Emergency Services and Disaster Agency ( ESDA ) authorization to commandeer county supplies and equipment to aid in the assistance effort . Bensenville requested aid from Du Page County ESDA . A store of more than 20 , 000 sandbags at the county ' s ESDA headquarters in Wheaton were distributed by midmorning Friday . County employees who didn ' t have flooding problems of their own and were able to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill sandbags . Gov . James Thompson , in Springfield Friday , said the state would provide whatever assistance necessary to help municipalities clean up but said there was little else that could be done because Friday ' s damage was caused by flash flooding and not by the longer-term flooding that caused last year ' s severe damage . At Resurrection Hospital , 7435 W. Talcott Ave. , the entire first floor of the hospital , including the emergency room , was flooded with a foot of water , causing emergency operations to be moved to an impromptu location on another floor . Ambulances were being diverted to other hospitals . Although water had not seeped into Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge , hospital administrators said their entire parking lot was under water and the surrounding area had been so hard hit by the storm that many employees had not made it into work . In the north and northwestern suburbs , where heavy flooding caused millions of dollars in damage last fall , Friday ' s rainstorm was bringing about a rerun of last year ' s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross had sent damage assessment teams into portions of Cook and DuPage County to monitor flooding and determine whether emergency disaster-relief shelters should be set up for flood victims . In Des Plaines , a heavily hit flood victim last Fall , Mayor John E. Seitz set up an emergency operating center in the basement of the suburb ' s City Hall at 1420 Miner St. The city also set up a special hotline number at 391-5395 to help residents in need of emergency assistance .
