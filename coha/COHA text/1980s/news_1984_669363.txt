' ' Stop throwing away your money ! ' ' they command. // ' ' Tired of paying high brokerage commissions ? ' ' they ask . ' ' Save 50 to 70 percent when you trade stocks. ' ' // Arguments like these are hard to ignore , and they have not only led to the expansion of the discount brokerage business , but to its spread into banks and savings-and-loans . A survey last fall by Discount Brokerage Advisory Service of New York found banks signing up more than 10 , 000 new discount brokerage clients a week. // For many people , though , the decision about whether to use a discount or full-service broker is more than just a dollars-and-cents argument. // ' ' The easiest criterion is to ask yourself if you are now making your own investment decisions , ' ' says Glen King Parker , chairman of the Institute for Econometric Research in Fort Lauderdale , Fla . ' ' If your ( full-service ) broker is making the investment decisions and you ' re satisfied with his decisions , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' re paying that broker $3 , 000 in commissions but he made $100 , 000 for you last year , stay with him. // ' ' I like to say that if the stockbroker recommends one good stock a year , he ' s probably worth what you ' re paying , ' ' Mr. Parker added. // He said some people make their own investment decisions but rely on a broker to provide information on various companies and industries , plus business and economic trends. // If this is so , Parker says , ' ' the first step is to find out what you ' re paying in commissions . The average person doesn ' t know what he ' s paying , ' ' because these costs are usually spread throughout the year and vary according to the size of each transaction. // Once investors do add up the commissions , they may find it costs less to buy all the information they need to make their own investment decisions . Subscriptions to the Wall Street Journal , Barron ' s , Business Week , Forbes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may add up to less than was being shelled out for brokerage commissions. // All this assumes , however , that the investor has the time and experience to do his own research and make his own buy-sell decisions. // Full-service brokers , with their full-service research , buying tips , and commissions , do make sense for ' ' someone who doesn ' t understand very well how the market works , ' ' says Ellis M. Ratner , executive vice-president of Discount Brokerage Advisory Services . He recently assisted Mark D. Coler , president of the firm , in writing ' ' 70% Off ! The Investor ' s Guide to Discount Brokerage ' ' ( Facts On File , New York , $24. 95 ) . // Full-service brokers may also be useful , he concedes , for someone who doesn ' t have the time or who lacks self-confidence about making investment decisions , or who simply finds the assistance of a broker ' ' comforting. ' ' // Many people , of course , use both a discount broker and one or more full-service brokers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in certain circumstances , says Edward I. O ' Brien , president of the Securities Industry Association . For example , an investor may want to ' ' fill out a position ' ' where he holds 90 shares of a stock and wants to add 10 shares to make it an even 100 . Or an investor consults with a broker on some stocks , but in a particular case ' ' knows exactly what he wants to do. ' ' // Some people will use a full-service broker to help them make buying decisions , but use a discounter to sell the stock , says Roger Servison , senior vice-president for marketing at Fidelity Investments in Boston. // As to the reported practice of getting recommendations from a broker , then executing those trades through a discounter , some people may be able to get away with it for a while , but it can be stopped pretty quickly by the full-service broker , Mr. Servison says . It doesn ' t take long before the broker realizes his or her recommendations are not resulting in trades . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which discounter to use - for those who have chosen to go this route - can be as complicated as deciding between a full-service and discount broker. // Certainly price is an important factor . While a typical full-service broker might charge $64 to trade 100 shares at $30 each , one can pay from $25 to $40 for the same service. // In their ads , the discounters will often try to show how much cheaper they are than other discounters . Of course , space in the ads prohibits listing all the competitors , but even if this were possible , it would not be done . Fact is , the exact discount commission depends on several factors , but primarily the size of the trade and the price of the share being purchased. // As an investor , then , your first task is to examine trading patterns . Do you tend to buy less-expensive stocks in small quantities , or do you buy higher-priced blue chips in big amounts ? Commission schedules are based on the size and price of trades , and while one broker may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the cheapest in another . The only way to find out is to call or write for as many commission schedules as you have the time and patience to wade through. // Be sure to tell the brokerage the price and number of shares you plan to trade . More-active investors often work with two or three discount brokers where they get good service . Then they can choose the cheapest one , depending on the size and price of their trade. // Several other considerations enter into the decision about which discounter to use , including whether the brokerage is in your hometown or a thousand miles away ( toll-free telephone numbers have reduced the importance of this ) ; whether it is a small broker that only trades stocks or a large one that also offers IRAs , Keoghs , money funds , asset-management accounts , and tax shelters ; or whether it ' s doing business in a bank. // You can often get a better rate dealing with a discounter directly ; but by using a bank or thrift you can have all interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bank account , where it will be protected by federal deposit insurance. // //
