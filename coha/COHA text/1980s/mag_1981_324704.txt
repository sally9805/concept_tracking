Merging for profit <P> When Iowa Banker Gardner Cowles bought the Des Moines Register in 1903 , he planted the seeds of a family communications empire that flourished for three generations , eventually as three separate companies , sprouting Look magazine , and acquiring numerous newspapers , radio and television stations as they grew . Last week two of his heirs decided to merge their companies , the Des Moines Register and Tribune Co. and the Minneapolis Star and Tribune Co. , presumably on the theory that the family that stays together profits together . <P> The news was expected : talks had been under way for several months between Des Moines Board Chairman David Kruidenier , 60 , and his Minneapolis cousin John Cowles Jr. , 52 . Both companies have suffered financial declines recently . In Minneapolis , operating earnings slid from $6 million in 1979 to $3.7 million a year later , largely because of a 27-day newspaper strike and continuing losses from its latest acquisition , the Buffalo ( N.Y. ) Courier-Express ( circ. 131,990 ) . The smaller Des Moines company saw its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1980 , in part , because of the troubled evening Tribune ( circ. 80,114 ) , which has been losing readers steadily for more than a decade . Even more serious for Des Moines was its long-term debt of $40 million . <P> As talks progressed , apprehension grew at the Register ( circ. 210,465 ) , possessor of nine Pulitzer Prizes , that the Des Moines company would be swallowed whole by the larger Minneapolis company . Last week 's agreement with its emphasis on preserving the independence of the papers allayed those fears . Said one relieved Register reporter : " I do n't think we have to worry any more about a Minneapolis Mafia moving in . " Register Editor Michael G. Gartner , who originally opposed the merger , agreed : " I feel it 's the right thing to do ; it will ensure that we have good , vigorous newspapers that are journalistically strong .
