Canadian autoworkers strike <P> The Canadian auto industry is virtually the mirror image of its larger U.S. counterpart , with plants stretching along the Great Lakes from Windsor , Ont. , to Montreal . They are owned by Detroit 's Big Four automakers , and 80% of the cars built go to the U.S. The auto-manufacturing operations of the two countries have long been operating together like a piston and a crankshaft . <P> Last week that close partnership came undone . Even as the United Automobile Workers union was celebrating the successful end of contract negotiations with the Ford Motor Co. and the ratification of another agreement with General Motors , its Canadian branch went on strike against GM . Blue-and-white picket signs went up in front of the Windsor transmission plant , just a short drive from GM 's Detroit headquarters , as workers shut down all 13 Canadian GM plants . <P> So intertwined are the operations in the U.S. and Canada that the 36,500 Canadian GM workers can disrupt production throughout the GM system in both countries . The Windsor trim plant , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visors for every domestic GM assembly plant . Since GM , like other automakers , has adopted new materials-handling techniques that keep inventories low , it could run out of vital parts in just a few days . Even worse , its dealers in both the U.S. and Canada could find themselves quickly short of new models , in part because new-car stocks are still depleted by the seven-day U.A.W. walkout in the U.S. a month ago . <P> The Canadian economy will also be pinched . Automobile production has been one of the economic bright spots in a country with 11% unemployment and a currency that has lost 13% of its U.S. dollar value since 1980 . A strike that lasts 2 months could cost Canada $1.5 billion and wipe out its current trade surplus . <P> In prior years , Canadian autoworkers have usually gone along with the U.S. contracts . This time the goals of the two countries ' workers are very different . U.S. employees , concerned about production 's shifting to nonunion plants overseas , gave up their customary wage demands in exchange for job-security guarantees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no Canadian GM workers are on layoff . Robert White , the aggressive head of the Canadian U.A.W. , has let it be known that his members do not want the profit sharing or lump-sum payments that are part of the just approved U.S. agreement . In addition , he claims that Canadian labor costs are $7.50 an hour less than the $22.50 an hour that GM pays in the U.S. , because of the shrunken value of the Canadian dollar and the fact that the Canadian government picks up most healthcare costs . As a result , White argues , GM can afford a richer settlement in Canada than in the U.S. <P> As the week drew to an end , bargaining on a new contract continued at the Royal York Hotel in Toronto . For GM , time is critical . Production has been halted on three Pontiac models produced solely in Canada : the 6000 , Grand Prix and Bonneville . GM concedes that Canadian-made parts are already in short supply at nine U.S. assembly plants , and shutdowns in those operations could come as early as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole car can be lost , and the strike may soon begin costing GM $30 million a week . - By Alexander L.
