The Presidency <P> The Secret Service will drive Andrei Gromyko through the gates of the White House to make sure he arrives safe and sound for his meeting with Ronald Reagan . Both the President 's military aide and the chief of protocol will be out under the West Wing Portico to add dignity when Old Grom , as he is semiaffectionately called by some diplomats , sets his feet on White House ground again after a six-year absence . <P> He will be steered through the Roosevelt Room , where he will pass a portrait of F.D.R. , the first President he called on . Gromyko could find his way in the dark , since he has logged dozens of visits to the Oval Office . When he sits down in front of the fireplace , in one of the Martha Washington chairs , to the President 's left , Gromyko will find he is quite an attraction . At least six of the President 's top men will be clustered around to weigh every word and interpret every gesture for some glint of the future relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of talk , the 75-year-old visitor will be escorted through the Rose Garden to the Family Dining Room . There will be some chilled Stolichnaya vodka from Mother Russia to wash down Chesapeake blue crabs out of Chef Henry Haller 's imaginative kitchen . Old Grom can demolish succulent rolled veal , served on Lyndon Johnson 's china and set off with a California wine . Finally , Gromyko will be escorted to the diplomatic doorway in the back of the White House for his exit , far from probing cameras and obstreperous reporters . It is a vantage point with a magnificent panorama of the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Memorial . On a clear autumn day the air seems to rustle with the presidential whispers that have changed history . <P> That is the way we deal these days with an eminence from the " evil empire . " <P> Gromyko is the first top Soviet official Reagan has been able to get his hands on when he needed to . Old Grom can not help mustering an inward smile about the royal treatment that follows a period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The President is tough in policy , in speeches , on paper . Eyeball to eyeball he softens , not hardens . He listens , smiles , talks softly , encouragingly . What will Gromyko hear ? How will he size up the leader of the free world ? We still wonder whether Nikita Khrushchev 's assessment of John Kennedy launched the Cuban missile crisis and whether Leonid Brezhnev 's contempt for Jimmy Carter encouraged the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . <P> For his part , Reagan is utterly baffled why the Soviets keep saying they fear him and America , because neither has ever had any ambitions for empire or world revolution . Can he get a clue from Old Grom ? Probably not . Gromyko is in his own way just as skillful an actor as Reagan . Gromyko has in the past reminisced about his warm times in the White House with Franklin Roosevelt and Cordell Hull . But just a few months ago he conducted a cold and programmed shouting match with Secretary of State George Shultz in Madrid over the Korean airline incident .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
