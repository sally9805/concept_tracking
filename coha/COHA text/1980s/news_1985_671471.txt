" We were picked last , " Herr says , forgiving but not forgetting . " But we have a lot of talent here . We had something to prove this season . We have a lot of weapons. " // Weapons like Tommy Herr , who is first in the National League in runs batted in , game-winning runs batted in and on-base percentage , second in batting average and hits and third in runs and doubles . He is a line-drive hitter who doesn ' t strike out very often , and he turned more double plays last year than any other second baseman in the league. // When he beat the Mets in Shea Stadium two weeks ago by hitting a ninth-inning home run in a scoreless game , Manager Whitey Herzog of the Cardinals said : // " Right now , he ' s the best player in the National League . If he played in New York or Los Angeles , he ' d be the All-Star second baseman every year. " 3 Knee Operations No , he doesn ' t sweep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the Mets open a weekend series in St. Louis tonight , they will find the Cardinals flying in the face of the forecasts , and they will find Thomas Mitchell Herr flying like no other Cardinal. // Not bad for a man who had three knee operations in nine months , and whose career was threatened almost before it began . But then , people were mourning the Cardinals this year , too . And now , they and their switch-hitting second baseman are two of the booming surprises of the baseball season. // Last year Herr hit . 276 and knocked in 49 runs ; the Cardinals finished third in the East . This year , Herr is hitting . 340 and already had knocked in 59 runs . And the Cardinals , even without Bruce Sutter , the ace reliever , are the acknowledged terrors of a four-team race. // " We can unsettle a lot of teams , " Herr said the other day by telephone from Philadelphia . " They don ' t enjoy playing us. " // Herr , who is 29 years old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astounded at the 1985 Cardinals and their run-producing track team . He surmises that they have assembled the fastest and best lineup since the Big Red Machine of Cincinnati 10 years ago , when they confronted pitchers with Joe Morgan , Pete Rose , Johnny Bench and George Foster . <> <> Coleman Is Leadoff Man // Herzog arrays a batting order that starts with Vince Coleman , the rookie sprinter , and Willie McGee , the accomplished and dashing No. 2 man . Next comes Herr , frequently with men on base . And , if you think the opposing pitcher is distracted by two " rabbits " on base and a . 340 hitter at the plate , imagine his state of mind when he checks the on-deck circle and sees Jack Clark , one of the top two or three players in the league in home runs , slugging percentage , runs batted in and on-base percentage. // " The biggest factor in my success this year , " Herr says , " is having Coleman and McGee hitting in front of me and Clark hitting behind me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting pretty good pitches , getting ahead in the count. // " I was mostly a second-place hitter before this year . When you hit second , you have to give yourself up a lot : take some pitches , go for ground balls to advance the runner . My average never was where it should have been. // " Now , I ' m in a situation where , if they get behind me in the count , they ' re in trouble . If they walk me , they ' ve got to deal with Jack Clark . They can either have me hit a single or have Jack hit a home run. " // Herr was asked to render a scouting report on himself , and obliged : // " Be careful with men on base or in scoring position . Very high rate of success in driving in runs . Change speeds on him , move the ball in and out . Don ' t pitch him the same way every time . " <> <> Converts to Switch Hitting // Herr was a natural right-handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania . But after he turned pro in 1975 , Bob Kennedy of the Cardinals ' staff watched him hit in the minor leagues and suggested that he try to swing both ways , left and right . A switch hitter was born. // " They thought I had good speed , " he says . " Also , I was a middle infielder , and they thought they ' d try it and see what happens . Once they planted the seed , I took off. " // He also took off on a pair of vulnerable knees . He made the Cardinals in 1981 and , in November of the following year , was hurt. // " I had knees , " he says . " From November of 1982 until August of 1983 , there were three operations , one on the right knee , two on the left . I was in a cast for six weeks after the big one . I had torn muscle , and was instructed to rehabilitate very slowly. // " By spring training last year , I felt I was ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ' 84 season . When it opened , I was in the lineup , but I had to prove to myself and the organization that I would play again . By the end of the season , I was playing well. " // By this season , he was playing even better than that , and he offers theories : // " We had a lot of variables in the spring . No one knew Vince Coleman was going to pop up on the team . No one knew Willie and I would have the years we ' re having . No one knew who would hit behind Jack Clark . No one knew who was in the bullpen. " // No one knew what Tommy Herr would do in the No. 3 spot , either. // " I wasn ' t even sure what I was capable of , " he says . " I knew I hit the ball hard enough to be a . 300 hitter . There ' s a very fine line between being a good hitter and a . 300 hitter . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 340 hitter is only four hits for every 100 times at bat. // " I thought I hit the ball really hard last year . I felt ready this year. " // He was ready , all right . Still , he remains a low-key but articulate person who doesn ' t sound off very much . He likes to fish and hunt bear and deer in the offseason , to spend time mulling things in his cabin north of Williamsport with his wife , Kim , and their small son , Aaron. // " I ' m not much of a rah-rah player , " Tommy Herr says . " I go out and play hard every day . On the Cardinals , we play with enthusiasm and intensity .
