ADVENTURES IN THE SCREEN TRADE by William Goldman ; Warner Books 418 pages ; $17.50 <P> In the mid-1920s , Ben Hecht received a telegram from Herman Mankiewicz , a friend and fellow writer who had made a pioneering trek from New York to Hollywood . Hecht was firmly advised to do likewise : " Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots . Do n't let this get around . " <P> It got around . Before long , writers of every stripe , from Dorothy Parker to Clifford Odets , had discovered this fantastic new way to waste their gifts and souls . That , at least , was the story many of them told throughout the ' 30s and ' 40s . The figure of the gin-soaked Hollywood sell-out became such a stale literary cliche that it found its way into the movies , where the studios and their hired scribblers could enjoy a hollow laugh at each other 's expense . <P> Author-Screenwriter William Goldman , 51 , has been around long enough to remember the bad old image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a writer of respectable fiction , far from the siren song of show business , and has published twelve novels . But he also labored successfully in Hollywood ( eleven credits ) during the period when movies became films , directors auteurs and screenplays the subjects of scholarly monographs . In discussing his own work for the people " Out There , " he neither cringes nor crows : " In terms of authority , screenwriters rank somewhere between the man who guards the studio gate and the man who runs the studio ( this week ) . " <P> Such modesty typifies the manner of Adventures in the Screen Trade , a loose collection of anecdotes from Goldman 's Hollywood experiences , plus thoughts on the present state of the film industry and how-to hints for aspiring writers with stars in their eyes . Goldman does not mention his two Oscars ( for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid and All the President 's Men ) or the beefy six-figure fees that his work has commanded . He emphasizes instead the pervasive uncertainty that seeps through all stages of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " about his subject in capital letters : NOBODY KNOWS ANYTHING . Films that can not fail do so , disastrously . " We 're home , " Richard Zanuck once cabled his father Darryl after a movie preview . " Better than Sound of Music . " The object of this enthusiasm was Star ! , which Goldman describes as " the Edsel of 20th Century-Fox . " Success is equally impossible to foresee ; the author rehearses the litany of studios that said no to Star Wars , Raiders of the Lost Ark and E. T.
