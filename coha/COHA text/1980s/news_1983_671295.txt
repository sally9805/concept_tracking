BY telephone from Rome ( where he is scouting locations for a movie about a pope who sneaks away from the Vatican to get in touch with himself ) , the director Robert Young talks about " The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez , " now playing at Cinema I. // " Gregorio Cortez " is based on a true story about a Mexican who , out of fear and confusion , shot and killed the sheriff of a small town in Texas in 1902 . " One of the things I thought was so poignant , " Mr. Young says , " is that here ' s a man whose ancestors lived in the Southwest long before the Anglos came . And then these other alien cultures come and wash over him , so **28;206; he <> finally becomes the immigrant . **28;236; He <> speaks the language that needs the translator . And Eddie Olmos " - who plays Gregorio - " looked to me like those old photographs I remembered of Sacco and Vanzetti . Here was this man racing against the 20th century , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being overwhelmed and changed by new ways of doing things . I wanted the film to resonate with history that was bigger than just the incident. " // Mr. Young , who is sometimes called a father figure in the development of American independent films , says it ' s hard for him to think of himself that way . " I mean , I am a father . I have five children , I ' m 58 . But for years , I was the youngest at everything . I started high school when I was 11 , I enlisted in the Navy in the Second World War when I was 18 . And I was arrested emotionally . I knew nothing about girls because they were always bigger than I was. " // Born in New York ' s Hell ' s Kitchen , Mr. Young grew up around show business . His Uncle Joe was a song writer ( he wrote " How ' Ya Gon na Keep ' em Down on the Farm ? " ) , and his father was a pioneer film editor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a talented guy , who should have been making movies , " Mr. Young says , " but he had very little education , and I think he was afraid . So in a way , I did it for him. " // In 1957 , Mr. Young made his first documentary film , " Secrets of the Reef , " and after that he went to work for NBC , turning out four of the network ' s prize-winning " White Papers . " " Then I got fired , " he says . " For making a film they wouldn ' t put on the air . I think it was my best movie . It was about life in the Sicilian slums . NBC said it was too real for the American public. " // " The Ballad of Gregorio Cortez " is a hit in Europe , even in the Soviet Union and Poland , though it isn ' t clear why an Eastern European country would take comfort from it . " It does show a racism in America , " Mr. Young says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have that , even though it can be traduced , makes us better people than we might be. " // A Director ' s Fascination With Puerto Ricans // The problems of Spanish-speaking people in an English-speaking culture also fascinate Jane Morrison , whose picture " The Two Worlds of Angelita , " about a Puerto Rican family moving to New York , opens today at the Carnegie Hall Cinema ( reviewed on page C4 ) . // Miss Morrison grew up in Maine , but she says : " I was always kind of too noisy for Maine . What I love about Puerto Ricans , especially in the island , is they make a lot of noise . They live a lot . They ' re very embracing. " ' // Having flown to the Caribbean on vacations , Miss Morrison became interested in the people leaving Puerto Rico on cheap night flights . " Coming to New York with their cardboard boxes , " she says . " I thought , they ' re at least as brave as anybody else who ever came to the city. " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , and to make it in Spanish . " Everyone said to me , ' Are you nuts ? You independent film makers are always trying to make things more difficult for yourselves. ' " // It wasn ' t easy to get backing either . " There are categories for helping minority film makers , " she says , " but not for helping people doing minority films. " // Once she started looking for actors , Miss Morrison discovered that Puerto Rico has its own caste system . " The old aristocracy that has controlled the island is Spanish , basically white . But the bulk of the population is nonwhite . When I told one actress - the queen of the island as far as acting goes , who would have been willing to darken her face to play the part of a peasant woman - that I wasn ' t going to choose her to play the grandmother , she said : ' You ' re not choosing me because the description of the character says dark skin . And there ' s absolutely no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of color . ' I said : ' Is that right ? Can a black person play an upper- class person in Puerto Rico ? ' She said : ' Of course not . The upper class is white. ' " // Miss Morrison thinks that most New Yorkers , reading about crime and drugs and unemployment in the barrio , believe that immigrants from Puerto Rico are dangerous . " I happen to disagree , " she says . " Seventy- five percent of the Puerto Ricans in New York are trying to keep their families together and to get their kids through school in a difficult environment . That ' s why I made this film. " // Another Lichtenstein Is a Hit in the Arts // You can get an argument about whether or not " Streamers " ( at the Lincoln Plaza ) is a good movie , but almost everybody likes Mitchell Lichtenstein in it . " I play the gay character , " the 27-year-old actor says . " He ' s one of the few survivors. " // For Mr. Lichtenstein , life has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter Roy Lichtenstein , and it never occurred to him that it might be tough to make a career in acting . " Since my father ' s very successful in an area that ' s even more rare to be successful in than acting , " he says , " I wasn ' t aware how unusual it was to be successful in the arts. // " I grew up assuming that if you wanted to do it , you could do it. " // In his case , a safe assumption . His first job after he got out of the Yale School of Drama was a lead in the movie " The Lords of Discipline . " " The director , Franc Roddam , wanted to use a lot of people who weren ' t known , " he says . " And he thought I looked like somebody you could believe came from a sort of protected , rich background . I had to go out and audition for Paramount executives , who sat stony-faced while we did scenes , but it was fun. " // From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Louis Malle ' s as-yet-unreleased " Crackers " and then into " Streamers , " directed by Robert Altman . Mr. Altman , Mr. Lichtenstein says , doesn ' t like to discuss character , he likes to give an actor hints . " Before we started shooting , I saw some high- heeled platform sandals , and I said to Scotty Bushnell , who did the costumes , ' Are these for me ? ' and she said , ' Well , Bob wants to see them . ' So we went out on the set , and I walked around in these ridiculous shoes , and Bob said , ' I like them . ' So that influenced me about how he wanted the character played . Any person who would wear those shoes wouldn ' t care what anyone else thought of him. " // Unlike many other actors , Mr. Lichtenstein is not a natural gypsy , and being uprooted - " The Lords of Discipline " was shot in London and Charleston , S.C. ; " Crackers " in Hollywood , " Streamers " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd , " he says , " because I don ' t have any really secure family background . We moved a lot , and my folks split . It ' s not as if I lived in the same house all my life . But I have a few friends I ' m really addicted to . My phone bill the first month in London was like $500 . Still , I ' m starting to realize I ' ll just be in this or that place for a while . And also to realize that when I ' m home in New York , I have my friends , but I ' m frantic because I ' m not working. " //
