I found San Mateo del Mar , the highly conservative ceremonial center , on a narrow strip of windblown sand dunes between isthmian lagoons and the raging Pacific Ocean . The place had an air of barbaric antiquity : Its empty streets were seared by sun and enclosed by high walls of matted cane . Dry winds drove stinging sands before them. // // Cold air masses sweep down from the Gulf of Mexico and clash with warm , moisture-laden air in the tropical Bay of Tehuantepec , precisely at San Mateo . These clashes cause seasonal disturbances , water spouts , and violent tropical storms . The Huaves were said to be powerful nature witches . Given their weather , I could see why. // After I presented my papers to the village authorities , a must in these circumstances , the mayor gave me space to sleep in and stow my gear in the deserted schoolhouse. // In contrast to the surrounding silence of the village , the garrulous market , where I could buy meals of fish and tortillas , teemed with enterprising Zapotecs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around a large open plaza dominated by a squat church built in the 17th century . Devoid of bell towers and corroded by sea winds , this structure irradiated an aura of pagan mystery. // ' ' What kinds of dances are performed here ? ' ' I asked the village mayor. // He named several , then mentioned : ' ' Omalndiuk , the Serpent ' s Head. ' ' // The next performance of this ancient ritual , still performed devotedly by the Huaves , was scheduled for the Corpus Christi celebrations the following year . I was determined to be there. // For a modest sum , the authorities permitted me to draw and measure the masks and costumes and arranged a partial rehearsal . I watched dancers in short embroidered and fringed capes , carrying small wooden ' ' lances ' ' in one hand , simulate the wiggling movements of a great serpent. // Two dancers stood out . One was Neajeng , the Archer , Father Lightning . Dressed in an incongruous black serge suit and matching homburg , he wore a crude , ruddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a feature seen on pre-Columbian Tlaloc sculptures. // The other dancer wore a white mask , a tan felt hat , and a wig woven from the hair of a white horse ' s mane . His legs were smeared with white clay . Tied to his left wrist was a small wooden disk . He endlessly rubbed a wooden machete across the disk while emitting an ominous bleating sound from his throat . Strapped to the small of his back was a good-size serpent ' s head , hacked from wood ; hence the dance ' s name . This dancer represented Ndiuk , the mythical water serpent. // Next year when I returned for the Corpus Christi celebrations , I found the performance much more exciting than the rehearsal. // This time the village authorities insisted I pay a fee to film the dance . In return I received an impressive permit stamped , signed , and thumbmarked by the 13 judges of San Mateo. // As I got ready to start filming , I congratulated myself on being here alone where I could blend in with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . Just then , an expedition from Mexico ' s National Institute of Anthropology unexpectedly appeared . Headed by the venerable ' ' papa ' ' of Mexican anthropology , Roberto Weitlander , it included several notables . Apparently assuming that all outsiders were connected , the local constable demanded that I pay an additional sum for these newcomers . But my funds were exhausted and I refused. // All of a sudden two masked comics appeared toting ancient chests intricately inlaid with fine woods . From these they extracted pots of embers and threw onto them red chilis . These produced clouds of cough-provoking smoke . The comics purposely pursued anthropologist Weitlander , blowing caustic smoke into his face , making the poor man run . Those of us who knew him were appalled. // Now the Huaves poured into the village square bearing fishnets with flowers stuck in them , saw fish snouts , and paper flags , and wearing minute animals of baked corn dough twined about their bodies . Making a tremendous din , they ran , jumped , mounted horses , or led mules . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firecrackers , the clanging of bells , the shrilling of flutes , the pounding of deer antlers on tortoise shells , the rolling of drums. // As I continued filming - the matter of the additional fee had not yet been settled - a Huave clubbed me on the neck . He sent tripod , camera , and brand-new Pan Cinor lens crashing to the ground . A brawl ensued . A sawfish impersonator with forbidding , toothy snout set upon me. // The ruckus ended with me in the local jailhouse . Juchitecos from the market guarded my photo equipment while two staunch friends , the old prayer master and the village mayor , quickly rescued me from jail. // Because of the presence of so many visiting anthropologists with their cameras held high , the Serpent ' s Head dance did not take place . Later , having made peace with the Huaves , I did see the dance . It depicts the death struggle between the Archer and the Serpent , culminating in the symbolic beheading of the Serpent . The Archer circles the kneeling Serpent , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pursues the Archer as dancers disappear in formation. // Life has been taken and restored . Nature has been renewed and the coming rains promised. // The performance was more than I had anticipated . It was not simply ' ' native dances , ' ' devised to entertain . What I saw had the essentials of true theater . I had witnessed a vital heritage that delved into the pre-Columbian magico-religious past . I saw that the old gods of Meso-America still exist in remote places in a vigorous theatrical tradition that fights fiercely for its survival. // //
