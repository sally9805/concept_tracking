LIFE/STYLE Vacations of a Lifetime American Youth Hostels Something no one else has done ' : Biking through China , a covered-wagon train in the Sierras , rafts on the Zambezi  | Mary Lou Schoening wanted to do something completely different . At first the 50-year-old homemaker from Bothell , Wash. , thought of hiking across the Himalayas in Nepal . But even that seemed a bit passe . " If I came back with four boxes of Nepal slides , none of my friends would look at them , " she said . " They 've all been there . " So in January she flew to Algiers and spent almost three weeks perched on a camel as it plodded through the Sahara desert , questing , she says , for " something no one else had done . " No one else , that is , had ever done it for the fun of it . Despite the worldwide economic slump , more people like Schoening are still spending more money to go farther afield . The World Tourism Organization estimates that 290 million people spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1982 may top that . " Taking a vacation is one of the last things people give up , " says Jonathan S. Linen , president of American Express Co. ' s travel division . " It 's virtually become an individual 's right . " The recession , of course , has forced many people to take shorter vacations , stick closer to home , hunt for bargains or forgo holidays altogether . Business at some traditional resorts is down substantially . But then there are exotica ? the one area of the tourist industry that has managed to prosper despite the larger economic pressures . Says Eberhard Gennrich , president of the Association of South African Travel Agents : " Some people want more than just a beautiful beach . " The tourist industry tempts such people with an astonishing variety of unusual expeditions . Some trips , like a polar-bear hunt in northern Canada for $22,000 a person , are strictly for the leisure class . Others , like a two-week bicycling trip through China starting at $1,275 , appeal to a wider market . But whether travelers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relaxation , they all demand authenticity . Inevitably , a few are disappointed . Travelers renting Mongolian yurts discovered that the tentlike structures were made of plastic , not animal skins . And some visitors complained that the locals had become too Westernized . " They 're about as Mongol as I am , " said one vacationer from Miami . Adventure means different things to different people . For the passengers of the MS Lindblad Explorer , a small , sleek luxury liner fitted with cozy air-conditioned cabins starting at $5,720 per person , the 26-day , 2,300-mile journey up the Amazon River can be as exciting or as staid as they want . As the ship steams into the sweltering rain forest , most on board attend the daily lectures on the profusion of flora and fauna around them ? huge Victoria Regia lilies , sloths , anteaters , tarantulas and about 800 different species of brilliantly colored birds . The more venturesome passengers take field trips in rubber boats , venturing up the river 's numerous tributaries and even into the jungle itself . For Evelyn Scott of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than just tropical plants and large bugs . She visited a leper colony run by Canadian and Peruvian missionaries , attended a feast prepared by one of the many Amazon Indian tribes and learned to shoot a blowgun the Indians use to hunt squirrel monkeys , sloths and other Indians . The passengers are allowed a fair amount of freedom . " We swam in the river ? even though we were warned about the piranhas , " says Scott . " Now that I think back on it , that probably was n't very smart . " Rafting down an 85-mile white-water stretch of Africa 's Zambezi River can be a bit more pulse-quickening than steaming up the Amazon . Starting near the mile-wide Victoria Falls , Sobek Expeditions of Angels @#  | Camp , Calif. , runs expeditions down a part of the river that explorer David Livingstone considered too rough to navigate . For $990 , tourists have the privilege of braving crocodiles , hippopotamuses , 20-foot waterfalls and 15-foot waves on the seven-day trip to Lake Kariba aboard inflatable rubber rafts . The rafters camp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribal villages along the way . " We 've never had any injuries , " says Sobek 's Richard Bangs , " although the rafts have been bitten by crocodiles . " The initial expedition , conducted just after the Zimbabwe war of independence , had other dangers . The region had been as thick with guerrillas as with wildlife , and the riverbanks had to be checked by soldiers for land mines before the raft people could pitch camp . Grouse Shooting : For thrills and challenge , the only thing that beats a river full of crocodiles is negotiating an evening of chitchat over dinner with a titled Englishman . To help pay for the manner to which they were born , several peers now open their stately homes to a " select few " guests , allowing them to live like lords ? for a price . At Blair Quhan Castle near Ayr , Scotland , even millionaire guests tend to be a bit nervous about sitting down to dine with some of the United Kingdom 's oldest families , says Marjorie Dewar , a Scottish travel agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are American , so just be American and it will all be a success ' . " Earl Peel goes grouse shooting every year with groups he and his family entertain at their fine eighteenthcentury Gunnerside lodge in the Yorkshire dales . The guests seem to have no trouble adapting to the rural , moneyed routine ? although a few are sometimes unsure how they should address their host . " I try to solve the whole thing straightaway by introducing myself as Willy Peel ' , " says the Earl . " That breaks the ice . " The cost of a week 's stay at Gunnerside is " substantial " ? and one topic the Earl refuses to discuss . " I 'll never talk about money to the guests , " he says . " That degrades the whole thing . " For a rougher breed of traveler a 20-mile hike can be the ultimate trip . Mountain Travel , Inc. , of Albany , Calif. , offers more than 230 different treks in far-flung areas such as North Yemen , the Galapagos Islands and the Japanese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey eastward from Katmandu to Kala Pattar near Mount Everest offers tableaux out of Shangri-La : high-roofed teahouses , peasants in yak-drawn carts and serene Buddhist temples with ancient prayer wheels fluttering in the wind . Herbert Greyson , an environmental manager for Mobil Oil Co. in New York , found that the breath-taking views more than made up for the hardships caused by the high altitude , extremes in temperature and a diet of lentils and potatoes . " We all suffered somewhat , " says Greyson . " But up there you 're literally on top of the world . " Mary Lou Schoening is right , however . The Himalaya trail is a widely traveled one , and the pace of 5 to 6 miles a day hardly presents a challenge to veteran mountaineers . " There were more people than I expected , " Greyson admits . " I had this vision that there would be no one . " Hot Springs : A more arduous alternative may be a 300-mile bicycling tour through China . The cyclists on the two-week tour run by China Passage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highlands of Guangdong Province to the rice fields of the Pearl River delta . Along the way they have the rare opportunity to stop for a soak in the hot springs at a spa in Conghua , visit a Taoist retreat in Xiqiao and spend the night at the Dali Peoples Commune . Bringing up the rear , a van that the agency has dubbed the " sag wagon " carries luggage , equipment and occasionally a worn-out biker . Clad in white crash helmets and bright red or yellow jackets , the cyclists soon find out that they are  | major attractions for the curious Chinese . But the trip 's real reward , says New Yorker David Wilner , 63 , is the sense of " seeing China the way the Chinese see it . " The tour 's Chinese escorts allowed the group to change the usually rigid itinerary and make spontaneous stops . The cyclists paid an unplanned visit to Sun Yat-sen University in Guangzhou , where they spent the afternoon talking with a group of English majors ? and distributed some of the 2,000 " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought from the United States . One unexpected side effect : despite the physical effort exerted in cycling nearly 30 miles a day , the food was so good that by the time the trip was completed the tour members had gained an average of 8 pounds . A more private form of exercise , particularly for those who do n't like summer vacations , is a week of " helicopter " skiing in New Zealand 's Southern Alps where it is winter in July . On South Island , sleek jet helicopters whisk skiers 10,000 feet up the face of Mount Cook for an uninterrupted 3,000-foot downhill run through untracked powder snow . Operating out of ski resorts in Queenstown , heli-skiing companies charge about $125 for four runs from 10,000 feet . For most of the skiers , the solitude is much more important than the challenge of the downhill run . " We looked down on the snow and there was n't a mark on it , " says one Australian . " And once the chopper had disappeared , it seemed like the whole world was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that true serenity is attainable only at 2,000 feet up ? preferably with the Burgundy wine country below . Sipping lighter-thanair Moet &; Chandon , they drift peacefully over medieval castles and walled cities , past green farmland and lush vineyards ? and land at a fourteenth-century chateau for a country-French repast . " Ballooning is totally serendipitous , " says Libby Dutton of The Bombard Society , the Los Angelesbased group that organizes the trips . " You never know where the wind will take you . " Cheers : Whichever way the Burgundy breezes blow , hot-air ballooning seems to open doors that usually stay closed . " The local folk cheer and break out the wine and invite you into their farmhouses , " says Dutton . The winds will carry about 1,000 Bombard clients around the region this year at a cost of $2,980 each . Starting in the medieval walled city of Beaune , the balloonists float above the wine country , staying aloft for about four hours each day . " It 's enthralling , " says Thomas Frame-Thompson , 68 , of Santa Barbara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole countryside or reach from the gondola and pluck an apple off a tree . " Not everything is left to chance , however . Along the back roads white-hatted chefs follow in minibuses , stopping to prepare impromptu picnics wherever the highflying drifters happen to land . Other ballooning adventures are far more rugged . The International Spelterini Society in Thalwil , Switzerland , runs an annual two-week summer tour in helium balloons across the Alps for $2,650 . These three- and five-person contraptions cruise as high as 15,000 feet . They may land high enough in the mountain to require a trek down ? and the society advises passengers to take along climbing shoes , a rucksack , rainwear and warm clothes . The balloonists also carry their passports , since it is almost impossible to control where the balloons will come down . When one landed in a small village near Padua , the local citizens were so delighted that they wined and dined the crew for two days . Another balloon landed in Lake Como and was rescued by a passing ship . Although there have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " an adventure with a carefully calculated risk . " But for most it is a risk worth taking . " When you drift over the Jungfrau , " says ErnstLudwig Bechtold of Offenbach , " it is as if you are on God 's doorstep . " Hot-air balloons are not even the most exotic conveyances in which travelers take their pleasure . Replicas of ancient Egyptian feluccas carry them down the Nile ; straining huskies haul them up and down Alaska 's Chugach Mountains . It is possible to re-create the westward trek of the pioneers in authentic covered wagons . Travelers along this route have reported that for solitude , Utah , Nevada and Wyoming compare favorably with the Mongolian steppes . " We did n't see a single car on our trip , " says Lois Corte of San Francisco . " There were no signs of civilization . " Haunted Houses : There are some journeys into the past in which total realism is to be avoided . On John Colclough 's Dublin-based Irish Country House Tours , the charming old homes and castles are said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Colclough 's " Ghostly Weekend " visit Clongowes Wood College ( haunted by the " fearful shape of a mysterious black hound " ) , Kilkea Castle ( the spirits of bodies interred in its walls roam the castle by night ) and the haunted churchyard of Coolgreaney . One French couple , says Colclough , insisted on spending the night in Huntington Castle ( " the most haunted castle there is " ) and became terrified when their bedroom suddenly turned ice cold . " It may have been that the central heating went off , " says Colclough . " But I do n't think so . " Other entrepreneurs are planning tours that have very real dangers . In Beirut last year two Austrian artists , Ursula and Bernard Muller , inaugurated a new kind of vacation that they called " crisis tourism . " Starting in the always volatile Middle East , they plan to conduct tours to several other world trouble spots . " What we hear and see on television is not sufficient , " says Muller . So they intend to see firsthand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political events . " So far there has been no rush of applicants , which may prove only that some places are too thrilling for even the most adventurous vacationer to enjoy . @# 70 NEWSWEEK/JULY 12 , 1982
