" Rembrandt : His Life , His Paintings " is one of the most controversial books ever written on the Dutch master . Convinced that the picture that has been painted of Rembrandt as a great humanitarian and absolutely original creative genius was in no way supported by historical evidence , Mr. Schwartz attacks it with all the archival ammunition he can muster . The artist who emerges from his richly detailed , unempathetic , occasionally angry monograph is competitive , self-centered , greedy , not particularly well-read , sometimes maladroit and in every way part of his age. // The book is one more example of the tidal shift against Formalism that has been characteristic of recent art history . Instead of approaching art largely on the basis of visual evidence provided by the work itself , many art historians are now considering art almost entirely within what they can determine of its social and political context . " Art history has always swung between contextual and visual orientations , " Mr. Schwartz said in a recent interview , " but it has never dealt with Rembrandt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visual Approach // An example of an essentially visual approach is the connoisseurship of the Rembrandt Research Project , an Amsterdam-based , five-member committee that has been working since 1969 to establish the authenticity of hundreds of works that have been attributed to Rembrandt , of which only around 30 are fully documented as his . The committee bases its decisions on historical documentation , on scientific procedures such as X-rays and on meticulous observation of such stylistic features as the touch and movement of the artist ' s brush. // The conference in Boston was called by the Metropolitan Museum of Art , the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston to assess the scholarly consensus about the research project ' s downgrading of five Rembrandts in their collections . Concluding from the meeting that the consensus did not exist , the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Fine Arts saw no reason to change their view that their disputed paintings were indeed by Rembrandt. // Mr. Schwartz is aware of the seriousness of the problems involved with attribution and de-attribution . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all but impossible to look at the artist freshly . He is convinced that the most productive way to approach Rembrandt now is in the context of his time . <> <> The Power of the Patron // His book discusses the social , political and religious controversies of the Netherlands in the 17th-century , its literary and intellectual climate and the struggle among artists for favor and fortune . Most of all , it considers the role of patronage . Many patrons were key players in the religious and political life of the age . They had a great deal to do not just with the choice of artistic subject but also with the size of a painting and sometimes with its style . " Art is embedded in its society , " Mr. Schwartz said . " In the last few years , it has been important for me to approach this systematically rather than beginning visually and then filling in. " // Gary Schwartz was born in Brooklyn in 1940 . His mother was Hungarian ; his father , who worked in and eventually took over his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The family moved to Far Rockaway when he was 12 . He attended Hebrew primary and secondary schools ; later he would spend one year at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. // He entered New York University at the age of 16 , took an art history course his freshman year from the celebrated scholar H. W. Janson and made art history his major . He was a graduate student in art history at Johns Hopkins University , where he specialized in medieval art . For Adolf Katzenellenbogen , the chairman of the department , the artist described by Mr. Schwartz as the " Moby-Dick of Dutch art " was an ideal. // " Naturally Rembrandt came out the winner in all the comparisons , " Mr. Schwartz said . " It was a foregone conclusion . He served as a model for everything art could be . Some of the greatest values of Western civilization were embodied in his work and person . " <> <> ' I Fell in Love With the Place ' // In 1965 , Mr. Schwartz went to the Netherlands on a Samuel H. Kress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paintings . " " I fell in love with the place , " he said . " Its understated beauty made me feel so much at home . Holland was a fulfillment of all the social and political values I had been raised to respect - tolerance , fair play , the rule of law , social justice - which I didn ' t feel were embodied any longer in America. " // In 1968 he married the Dutch art historian Loekie Hendriks . They have two teen-age children and live in a 260-year-old house in Maarssen , near Utrecht , where they met within a few weeks of his arrival . This year Mr. Schwartz is a Getty scholar at the Getty Center for the History of Art and the Humanities in Santa Monica , Calif. , where he is gathering material on the 17th-century Dutch painter Pieter Saenredam. // His study of Rembrandt began in 1969 when he helped edit and translate Horst Gerson ' s " Rembrandt Paintings , " which made him familiar with the artist ' s life and work . " Gerson ' s attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " identifying Rembrandt ' s hand in the painting , but he was open and even iconoclastic and would encourage and listen to other viewpoints. " // At the same time , he met Mr. Gersons ' s friend , J. A. Emmens , the author of " Rembrandt and the Rules of Art , " whose approach was more contextual . " The circle around Emmens was fundamentally concerned with the intellectual judgments that go into the prevailing opinions of an age , " Mr. Schwartz said . <> <> Chapters Became ' Connected ' // He began gathering research in 1977 . The book came together in the winter of 1983 . " Until then I had seen the chapters as disparate entities , and now they became connected , " he said . " It was the relation between the patrons and the people with whom Rembrandt had been involved that drew everything together .

He also believes the tools he uses to consider the relationship of art and artists " to the total production of art in the society in which they originated " can not now also do justice to what it is that may enable art to live on for centuries after it is made . The split between the experience of art and a historical approach to it , which has almost always been present in art history , is severe. // " I wanted to find a way to deal with this emotion that came out of me in front of the work , " Mr. Schwartz said , describing why he became a Rembrandt scholar . " I wanted to account for how Rembrandt came to have the power to evoke something so large . " When asked if his book had enabled him to define the emotion , he replied , " insufficiently. " // " Maybe it will be possible in the future to deal with the work on a more integral level than now , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historical reconstruction without dealing with what brings us to art in the first place .
