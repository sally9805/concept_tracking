The test scheduled for this Tuesday is code-named Mighty Oak . If all goes as planned , a U.S. nuclear device will explode in a tunnel beneath the dry lake beds of Nevada , some 100 miles northwest of Las Vegas . On the scale of modern tests , it rates as a penny-ante blast , releasing a mere 20 kilotons of explosive power , equivalent to 20,000 tons of TNT . Such a test usually does nothing more than rattle the china in a few Nevada closets . But this time the shock waves could reverberate around the world . <P> The Nevada explosion , designed to test the effects of radiation on American warheads , will underline in the bluntest possible manner the swift White House rejection of the Kremlin 's latest arms-control overture . With the deft mixing of propaganda and substance that has been the hallmark of his style , Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev went on television two weeks ago , with no advance word to the U.S. through diplomatic channels , to propose that President Reagan meet him promptly in Europe to negotiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected the offer and continued testing , Gorbachev warned , the Kremlin would end its self-imposed eight-month moratorium . New nuclear tests by both sides , following a long series of diplomatic developments that have shaken relations between the superpowers over the past few months , would deeply affect an even more fundamental question : Can anything be preserved of the accommodative " spirit of Geneva " that emerged from the Reagan-Gorbachev summit only five months ago ? <P> A preliminary answer should be forthcoming promptly . On Tuesday  --  possibly just as the U.S. nuclear test blast is going off  --  Anatoli Dobrynin , who is departing after 24 years as Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. , is scheduled to call at the White House for a talk with Reagan and Secretary of State George Shultz . U.S. officials hope Dobrynin , who is taking up a Kremlin post as a senior adviser to Gorbachev , will be carrying a message that could get private discussions going again after months of what diplomats brand " megaphone diplomacy . " Indeed , Dobrynin reportedly has been empowered to set a date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shultz has been trying to arrange for months . They would begin preparing a more important meeting : the second Reagan-Gorbachev summit , which is supposed to occur in the U.S. this year . <P> That would be an encouraging development in view of private growling lately from both sides that they can do very well without another summit , thank you . But even if both sides agree to keep planning for a summit , it will take much more to dispel the sour atmosphere that has developed between the superpowers since the Geneva meeting . In fact it may tax diplomats ' ingenuity to keep relations from deteriorating further , and fast .
