The man-made portion , known as the ' Big Ditch , " begins at Norfolk , Va. , and runs south to the Florida Keys . North of Norfolk the Intracoastal , or Inland Waterway , as it is most commonly called , is mostly a convenient concept for the sheltered course a craft would naturally chart . The route is through the Chesapeake Bay , across to Delaware Bay , a loop south to pick up the passage northward just inside New Jersey ' s coastline , and then via Long Island , Block Island , and Nantucket Sounds to the Cape Cod Canal in Massachusetts . The whole is maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers and policed by the Coast Guard. // Indians used the inland waters of the Atlantic seaboard for centuries , but not until 1940 did the federal government essentially complete the all-weather passage . Establishment of such a project was necessary for commercial barges navigating north and south along the length of the coast and for operators of small craft seeking security from the treacheries of open-sea travel , especially around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who wish to see the unique cross section of environments  --  famous cities , small historic towns , a variety of uninhabited wilderness  --  through which the Inland Waterway cuts , American Cruise Lines offers opportunities for happy discoveries. // The pre-sail scene for the two-week cruise from Savannah , Ga. , to Annapolis , Md. , on the Independence is more friendly , less organized , than on larger ships . Since she holds only 80 passengers , departure is made as soon as all are aboard . We pull away from the Savannah River bluff where General Oglethorpe and his band of colonists first pitched their tents in 1733 , and shortly thereafter laid out the city , which today has an appealing atmosphere of tradition , historic architecture , and subtropical Southern charm. // Almost immediately the river banks flatten out into a level landscape that carries the eye far across salt marshes to the horizon . Along the calm waters of the exaggerated curves of the oxbows of the Savannah River , wildlife is plentiful . Pelicans hardly pause between dives for fish . Literally , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Savannah and the Tybee National Wildlife Refuges . At some point , the ship passes from the Savannah River , which is the border between Georgia and South Carolina , into Inland Waterway waters. // Shortly , we sight Harbour Town on Hilton Head , the prototype of island developments . After a launch excursion ashore , cruise passengers are ready to satisfy their curiosity concerning food. // Cuisine is American , with efforts made to serve local specialties . Tonight that includes fresh fish and a variety of " greens , " a catch-all Southern vegetable term . The single-seating meals are served family style . There are no set table assignments , which provides an opportunity to get to know many fellow passengers during meals. // The next morning we proceed to Beaufort , S.C. , a town of 14 , 000 over which six flags have flown : Spanish , French , English , Scottish , American , and Confederate . Formally founded in 1713 , the town has many magnificent houses now restored to their pre-boll weevil days of successful cotton commerce splendor . A Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide verandas , and lush vegetation : wonderfully scented wisteria , azaleas , towering Victorian tea roses , oleanders , magnolias measuring 60 feet , and massive-limbed live oaks even larger . Spanish moss is draped on everything , including the town ' s telephone wires. // A storm with severe winds raged the next morning and meant a postponement of our departure for Charleston , S.C. Traveling the Inland Waterway requires a certain flexibility in the schedule to allow for such events . As a result , these cruises have some of the flavor of unexpected adventure found on freighters. // Evening entertainment is left to the resources of passengers , be it browsing in the ship ' s library , TV in the lounge , a bridge game . Since the ship is moored each night , an after-dinner walk ashore is a pleasant possibility . Many retire early so as to be enthusiastic about arising to see us set sail , usually just after daybreak . The Independence follows a daylight schedule . Scenery is never missed because of traveling in the dark. // The port of call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are carefully taught , Charleston is the place where the Ashley and Cooper Rivers meet to form the Atlantic Ocean . She boasts three centuries of cultural and architectural tradition , the best of which comes from the era of post-Revolutionary War , great-plantation prosperity . The Charleston waterfront , famous for its beauty , includes the East Battery with its sea wall walk , and the South Battery with its classic row of handsome white houses and pillared porches purposely positioned to catch the sea breezes . Palmetto palms stand like sentinels along the driveways ; gardens are enclosed by ornate cast iron railings. // In the next day ' s " dawn ' s early light " the Independence passes Fort Sumter , at which was fired the shot that started the War Between the States , known in Yankee latitudes as the Civil War . Although they have been thoroughly enjoyable to visit , especially so with the effortless ease of arriving by water that is a luxurious characteristic of cruises , it is nice to leave the cities behind. // The exotic flora of the subtropical South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pink azaleas growing wild in the woods . There is enormous variety in the textures and tones of this terrain . Sun sparkles on the water surfaces of the swamps , sea marshes , and tidal inlets . Low-flying flocks of laughing gulls and high-flying formations heading north accompany us . Our slow motion past the landscape augments the feeling of timelessness in the surroundings. // Overnight moorings are made in pleasant backwaters . In Bucksport , S.C. , a waterway watering hole 13 miles from the nearest town , a five-mile walk inland along the single road in the region reveals wooden shacks , revival churches , and fields of growing greens . At Wrightsville Beach , N.C. , are comfortably shabby summer cottages and an opportunity to walk on the sand dunes seen all day along the horizon . Belhaven , N.C. , is yet another small , friendly typical riverfront town . Its pride seems to be a museum of amazingly mundane memorabilia which we are encouraged to visit. // Some passengers have followed the course of the Independence closely on the ship ' s navigational charts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maneuvering of the Inland Waterway is necessary and why dredging is a continual process . A full moon has produced an exceptionally low tide . That , in combination with shifts in the sand shoals during a recent storm , has caused us to run aground  --  gently , however , since we ' ve been warned of the danger by a barge master ahead . Fortunately , the tide is incoming and we wait only a few minutes before floating free again. // The last stretch of the man-made section of the Inland Waterway is through the Pungo and Alligator Rivers , up the P &; A Canal , under the distinctive bridge slung low and long across albemarle Sound , whose shallow but wide waters make it the most unpredictable place in the entire waterway . Today , it is as calm as it is ever liable to be . Once through the Chesapeake and Albemarle Canal and the 600-foot Great Bridge lock , designed to prevent the exchange of salt and fresh water , we sweep into Norfolk , Va. , with its naval yards , which have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the broad Hampton Roads shipping channel and over the 6 , 860-foot tunnel part of the Chesapeake Bay Bridge  --  an engineering marvel that was completed in 1957  --  brings us to the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay , the beginning of the " natural " Intracoastal Waterway which winds its way north to Massachusetts. // The Chesapeake is an inland sea , 200 miles long and up to 30 miles wide . It ' s a water world where fishermen are called " watermen , " most commerce is carried on by ship , and everyone ' s favorite forms of recreation seem associated in some way with the bay. // We moor at Yorktown , Va. , where , in 1781 , the British under Cornwallis surrendered to the American forces , ending British rule in America . Later , we cross the Chesapeake , finding it strange to be out of sight of shore after days in the closely confined channel of the Inland Waterway . We watch waterfowl at play and watermen at work . At Oxford , on the Eastern Shore of Maryland , we enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Proclaimed a port of entry in 1694 , once active in the exportation of tobacco , Oxford has only recreational craft in its harbor today. // Consolation for the fact that the cruise is over is that we debark at attractive Annapolis . With a long and glorious history , she is active and alive today because of the United States Naval Academy and many yachting activities. // Schedules of Inland Waterway cruises , which go north from Savannah in spring and south from Annapolis as far as Florida in the fall , aboard the Independence and her slightly smaller sister ship , American Eagle , are available from American Cruise Lines , Haddam , CT 06438 ; or call its toll-free telephone number , 1-800-243-6755 . The cost for the 14-day cruise is $1 , 722 for a single cabin ; $1 , 386 per person for a double ; and $1 , 176 per person for the ship ' s one triple. // //
