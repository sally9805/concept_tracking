Of all the final games in sports , none delivers on its annual promises more consistently than college basketball 's national championship . Another stirring finish last week carried Louisville over Duke , 72-69 , by the caprice in the fading seconds of a Cardinal shot so badly missed that only another Louisville man was in a position to jump for the ball : 6-ft. 9-in . Freshman Pervis Ellison . <P> As wiry as a mouth full of braces , three days shy of 19 , Ellison instantly followed the shot into the basket and before long followed the basket to the foul line . Two calm free throws topped off his 25-point performance , good for the Most Valuable Player trophy , and the Cardinals ' second title of the ' 80s . " What 's the MVP , " Ellison asked beautifully , " when you 've got the national championship ? " Not since the ' 50s and Bill Mlkvy , Temple 's renowned " Owl-Without-a-Vowel , " has basketball identified a hero as charmingly as " Never Nervous " Pervis . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team and a coach been as consonant as the University of Louisville and Denny Crum . <P> A pup out of Wooden , Crum both played and coached for the retired architect of ten National Collegiate Athletic Association championships , including every one of them from 1967 to 1973 . When Crum left UCLA for Louisville 15 years ago , his avowed plan was to win enough games so that , upon Wooden 's valedictory , he could return to a complete acclaim . The winning has come easier than the acclaim . <P> With six appearances in the Final Four , he has now pulled abreast of the University of Kentucky 's fabled Adolph Rupp , a mean truth to many of the college-basketball fans " out in the state . " Everywhere but Louisville , and sometimes in Louisville , the Cardinals are still referred to as " the blackbirds . " While U.K. broke its color line way back in 1970 , the Wildcat affirmative-action program pales in contrast to U.L. 's . It is conceivable that Duke had more rooters in the state of Kentucky than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ token , or at least a similar one , some of Duke 's regular supporters brought an elitism to Dallas that had shades of racism . A popular parable : if a high school basketball player asked about his " boards " replies " I average eight rebounds a game , " he is a better candidate to attend Louisville than Duke . Certainly Duke is an excellent school ( Richard Nixon 's law alma mater ) , but Louisville must be meeting some standard of education . Ellison became the center of the team only after the incumbent was declared academically ineligible . <P> Another thing , considering the rate at which the Cardinals have been succeeding , it seems unlikely that jealous rivals would permit even the common crimes of college sports to go on there unreported . Throughout the Final Four , whistles were blowing all over Texas about some sin or other of the Longhorns . Crum , 49 , who eventually rejected an offer to return to UCLA , is three seasons into a ten-year agreement calling for a $1 million bonus if he completes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
