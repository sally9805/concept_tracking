It is the old machine vs. the new mayor <P> Nobody expected an effectless transition , but nobody quite expected the farce now being played in Chicago . After only two weeks into Harold Washington 's four-year term as Chicago 's first black mayor , the city government was stalemated . When Washington , a Democrat elected despite opposition from his party 's old guard , threatened to make good on his inaugural promise- " Business as usual will not be accepted by the people " - the city 's Democratic political Establishment came together in a new , sometimes unseemly vigor , determined to outmaneuver and outbellow the antimachine mayor . To paraphrase the 1955 words of the late alderman Paddy Bauler , it seemed that Chicago was not quite ready for reform yet-not Harold Washington 's brand , for sure . <P> Typical was the scene last Wednesday at a meeting of the 50-member , all-Democratic city council . Frequent howls of " Point of order ! " rose from the chamber floor as spectators catcalled back . At one point in the heated 2-hour session , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chicago Democratic machine , shouted at the presiding mayor : " Government by chaos , Mr. President . Rule or ruin ! Are you a dictator ? " When Washington threatened summarily to clear the chamber , Vrdolyak , 45 , known as " Fast Eddie " for his slick political skills , leaped to his feet , held out his arms and yelled , " Get the handcuffs out ! " <P> Behind the tantrums and soap-opera posturing was the question of who would govern the city for the next four years . Says Washington , 61 , who was elected on April 12 with 51.8% of the vote : " It appears that some members of the city council are apparently experiencing a nervous reaction to the prospect of reform . " Shortly after the election , at what was supposed to be a " unity " breakfast , Washington had confided some of his reform notions to Vrdolyak . As might have been predicted , the city 's craftiest politician did not respond eagerly to the news that he would be stripped of his job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ceremonial post as president pro tern of the council . " That 's when I knew it would be war , " Vrdolyak told the Chicago Sun-Times . " There 's the mayor , the new guy on the block , telling me I 'm out . So I say to myself , I thought this guy was just mayor . But he thinks he 's king . So , did I want to fight ? No . Do I know how ? You bet . I do n't go down easy . "
