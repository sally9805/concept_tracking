In an age of high interest rates and high construction costs , the circumstances of much of the population - smaller families , fragmented families or no family at all - would seem to favor owning smaller , easier-to- maintain condominiums or cooperatives or living in rental apartments. // But the prospect of owning and living in a freestanding house on its own land is an enduring element in American aspirations. // According to a recent New York Times/CBS News Poll and interviews with owners and renters across the country , house ownership is still a goal of a majority of Americans , as it was of earlier generations. // " I ' m old-fashioned , " said Eddie Mulholland of Jefferson City , Mo . " I believe a house is the family dream . My goals in life have always been to get a college education and then get a family and a house. " // Many will find it harder than their parents did to realize that goal , however . The average American has less buying power in the housing marketplace than a decade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of consumer satisfaction is the housing life cycle , " said George Sternlieb , director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at Rutgers University , who described the American progression from first apartment to " starter house " to larger house as the family grows . But income adjusted for inflation , which rose 38 percent in the 1950 ' s and 33 percent in the 60 ' s , dropped 9. 2 percent between 1973 and 1982 . So now , among those who buy , " you have home ownership costs of 35 percent to 40 percent of income , " Dr. Sternlieb said . " Some simply can ' t buy. " // In the last decade , inflation has increased the price of all consumer products , but home ownership costs have risen more steeply , primarily because of the high cost of borrowing money . According to Jack Carlson , chief economist of the National Association of Realtors , the average mortgage rate with inflation taken into account was between 3 and 4 percent over the last 30 years . But in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent in 1984 , he said , and he estimates it will be about 9. 8 percent in 1985. // Mr. Carlson ' s organization maintains an " affordability index , " which compares the median family income with the income required to meet the payments on the median-priced house . When the index began , in 1971 , it took an income of $6 , 770 to be able to afford the median house , which was then priced at $24 , 800 . But actual median income that year was $10 , 300 , which was 51. 9 percent more than the amount required. // At the end of 1984 , according to the real-estate group , with higher interest rates the income required to meet expenses on the median house , which cost $72 , 800 , was $29 , 818 , but the actual median income was $26 , 300 , or 11. 8 percent less than the required amount. // The new realities of housing costs have created a market in which some consumers are sheltered but not satisified . Richard Mettler , executive vice president @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few years the construction trend there has shifted from 70 percent detached housing , 10 percent attached and 20 percent rental to approximately an equal division among the three . But , he added , " our surveys have shown that the main desire people have is to be able to walk around the outside of their home and call it their own home . " This will mean that more single-family homes will be built , he said , but they will be smaller and harder to afford. // At the American Planning Association , an urban-planning group , Judith Getzels , the research director , and Welford Saunders , another researcher , recently completed a three-year study sponsored by the Department of Housing and Urban Development . Mrs. Getzels confirmed " an enormous pent-up demand " for smaller dwellings , especially among first- time buyers whose budgets are stretched . " In California , " she said , " Riverside County put up a special district of small lots with houses ranging from 800 square feet to 1 , 400 square feet . The prices ranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those houses were sold out almost immediately - people stood in line all night. " // According to The Times/CBS News Poll of 1 , 534 people interviewed from Jan. 14 through 17 , 76 percent of the public believes that people who never own a house are " missing out on an important part of the American dream . " Fifty-five percent of all renters said they expected to buy a house . Among the 18- to 29-year-olds who presently rent and whose aspirations will have the largest effect on the housing market , 63 percent plan to become homeowners. // " The home you own is the No. 1 priority of people , " said Dowell Myers , the head of the American Planning Association ' s division on housing and an assistant professor of urban planning at the University of Texas in Austin . He cited surveys taken by the Roper Organization in 1975 , 1978 and 1981 that consistently showed home ownership ranking above such goals as having a happy marriage or children . High purchase prices and high interest rates have combined to make ownership much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' t died the way you think it would. " // Higher costs have meant difficulties , he added : " Couples in their 20 ' s are trying to do three things at the same time - get careers started , buy a house and have kids. " // The American household has shrunk strikingly in size since the 1960 ' s . According to the Census Bureau , average household size had fallen to 2. 71 people in March 1984 , the most recent date for which figures are available , down from 3. 14 in 1970 , indicating that the typical household now needs less space . Two-income families create larger incomes for more households than ever before , but the second income is necessary to meet increased housing costs , according to Mr. Myers . Such families often delay having children and have fewer children. // In addition , many more people are living alone . Of the 85. 4 million households in the United States , nearly 20 million people live alone , up from 10. 9 million in 1970 , according to a 1983 census @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group generally less able to afford housing and less willing to take on the burden of home maintenance , rose in the same period to 9. 9 million , from 5. 5 million . Both trends are continuing , according to the Census Bureau. // The strength of the American consumer ' s desire to own a home has made buyers willing to pay more for the privilege . According to Mr. Carlson , the economist , homeowners are now typically committing 36 percent of their incomes to shelter - mortgage payments , taxes and utilities - compared with 33 percent 10 years ago and less than 30 percent 10 years before that. // " They ' re saying they want more , or that they feel more must go into shelter than in the past , " Mr. Carlson said . He added that with costs continuing to rise and since the percentage of income that can be devoted to housing is not limitless , the other part of the equation - the size of the house - must give. // Thus , houses have become smaller . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 1 , 655 square feet , and dropped to 1 , 520 square feet in 1982 , before rising slightly to 1 , 565 square feet in 1983 , the most recent year for which figures are available. // The struggle - income versus housing costs - also shows up in the proportion of the population living in owner-occupied dwellings , now 64 percent , down from 65. 4 percent in 1979 . The figure had been rising slowly but steadily , from 55 percent in 1950 to 61. 9 percent in 1960 and 62. 9 percent in 1970. // While there does not appear to be comparable data measuring the desire for house ownership a decade or two ago , the slight dip in the proportion of owner-occupied units does not seem to be by choice. // " If you ' re renting an apartment , all you ' ve got to show for it is a bunch of canceled checks at the end of the year , " said Howard Browning , who was one of the respondents in The Times/CBS News Poll . Mr. Browning would like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " with a lot of at least five acres , " but he thinks he will be renting for at least the next several years , because of high interest rates and a relatively low income. // Mr. Browning , an unmarried 25- year-old draftsman who was recently laid off from his job at a company that manufactures industrial equipment , pays $300 a month for his two- bedroom apartment in an old farmhouse in Analomink , Pa. , north of Allentown . An apartment , he said , is " not something you ' ve designed , or something you want. " // In Gahanna , Ohio , near Columbus , Sharon Oxlay , who is divorced , thinks that the main benefit of owning a house is " the fact that it ' s yours and nobody can put you out of it , as long as you make your payments , " she said. // Mrs. Oxlay , another poll respondent , has five children , ranging in age from 7 to 14 , and would like to buy the three-bedroom , two-bathroom split- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s really hard to rent a home when you have more than two kids , " said Mrs. Oxlay , a 32-year-old housecleaner . To buy , she will probably have to take a second job and make other financial sacrifices , she added. // For many young families , moving up to home ownership can force them to make other changes . Eddie Mulholland , 27 , lives with his wife , Anne , 25 , and their 18-month-old daughter , Maureen , in a four-bedroom , ranch- style home they own four miles from downtown Jefferson City , Mo . The house cost $69 , 000 , and Mr. Mulholland traded his monthly apartment rental of $350 for monthly mortgage payments of $500 , plus taxes and utilities. // To afford the house , Mr. Mullholland quit his job as a fifth-grade teacher to earn $4 , 000 a year more as a Y.M.C.A. recreation director . And Mrs. Mulholland went to work full time as the nursing manager of a hospital , although she preferred part- time work. // There are , of course , exceptions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mass . , June Namias , who is divorced , has lived in her rent- controlled apartment for 20 years and has no plans to move . The apartment is in an older building , with a rounded , castlelike facade , a block from the Radcliffe College campus . " I don ' t care if I own it , as long as it ' s accessible , " said Mrs. Namias , a 43-year-old high school teacher . " To me , ownership means stairs falling down , mortgages , papers , responsibility , a lot of time and energy. " // In Jefferson City , 27-year-old Debbie Neff and her husband , Bruce Farmer , 28 , both lawyers with the State Attorney General ' s office , have a combined income of $38 , 000 and live in a $275-a-month apartment . They wonder if it would be worth the struggle to own a house . " We could afford a house , but it would be touch and go , and we ' d have nothing left , " said Miss Neff . " It ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we wanted to go to law school , and there are other things we need like wardrobes , cars and furniture. " // Others have found that home ownership can be profitable . Bernard Goodman , a 41-year-old physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Sandy Goodman , 42 , of Cambridge refer to their three-family house covered in pink aluminum siding as a " three-story trailer , " but their two rental apartments provide income. // " My only comforting thought when we bought this monstrosity , " said Mrs. Goodman , " was that clearly it is a wise investment . " The Goodmans occupy one and half floors of the house , room enough for the couple ' s three boys , two cats and one dog. // Katie and Herman Orcutt are using their current home in central Phoenix as a stepping stone to new and larger quarters . Ten years ago they paid $22 , 000 for an older , 1 , 100-square-foot Spanish-style house , on which they have done considerable work. // Now , according to Mrs. Orcutt , 37 , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s mistakes , we want to start out fresh . " Mr. Orcutt , 42 , is an architect , and the couple are building a new house , five miles north of their present home . Their current house is now on the market for four times the amount they paid for it. // But the Orcutts are looking further ahead , beyond the 3 , 300-square-foot house with three bathrooms , swimming pool and three-car garage that they and their two young children will occupy in the spring . Eventually , they would like to build a cozy , solar- heated house on the side of a mountain , with two bedrooms , one bath , a fireplace and , Mrs. Orcutt said , " no room for children. " // There are some who wonder if they will ever fulfill such goals . Virgil A. Grimard , a 38-year-old plumber , and his wife , Dale , live with Mrs. Grimard ' s 8-year-old son , William , in a 20-year-old , 10-by-50-foot mobile home in a trailer park on U.S. 1 just north of Titusville , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 , and they think that mortgage rates are too high for them to buy a house , even with Mr. Grimard ' s veterans benefits. // But he is clear in his aspirations : " I want to build a place that will last 200 years , a place my **25;1534;TOOLONG can live in and say , ' My great-great-granddaddy built this place . ' That ' s what this country was founded on , but that ' s getting harder and harder to do. " // How the Poll Was Conducted // The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Jan. 14 through 17 with 1 , 534 adults around the United States , excluding Alaska and Hawaii. // The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country . The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population . For each exchange , the telephone numbers were formed by random digits , thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of household size and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region , race , sex , age and education. // In theory , in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans . The error for smaller subgroups is larger . For example , the margin of sampling error for renters is plus or minus 5 percentage points. // In addition to sampling error , the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll. // //
