Settlements without judges <P> The path that neighborhood youngsters had beaten across the elderly woman 's backyard was irritating enough . But when the youths began picking her flowers as well , the lady grabbed her gun and began plinking away . Though no one was hurt , police were called and the parents prepared to press charges . In most cities , the result would have been a court proceeding and bad tempers all around . But in Columbus the matter was turned over to an informal mediation process called the Night Prosecutor 's Program . Within two weeks , after a meeting refereed by a local citizen trained in mediation techniques , the parents and the homeowner made a deal : they would control their kids better , she would sell the gun , and together they would finance a fence . Case closed . <P> More than one-third of the misdemeanor complaints that come to the Columbus police are now settled in this way-without judges , lawyers , and other legal impedimenta . Some 100 other municipalities are experimenting with similar programs , which seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are otherwise fated to have a continuing relationship . For such citizens , winner-take-all court decisions may leave only heightened anger ; mediation , by contrast , seeks to cut small problems down to size , or " make the forum fit the fuss , " as U.S. Assistant Attorney General Maurice Rosenberg puts it . <P> One of the first such programs was set up in 1975 in the crime-plagued Dorchester section of Boston . Of the 1,200 cases heard in Dorchester 's storefront Urban Court Program so far , 89% were settled there without having to be put before a judge . No one is forced to participate ; either party in a dispute may insist on having his case heard in a conventional court . Those who decide to try the program sit down with two mediators-community members who are paid $7.50 a session for this part-time work and are trained to handle disputes coolly . Says Urban Court Mediation Supervisor Delia Rice : " We choose people we feel can put on a neutral hat . " <P> Typically , the opponents in a case will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way to lead the parties toward a compromise . Says Mediator Lamont Montigue , a cook : " You do n't settle the situation . You let the agreement come from them . " When it does , the former opponents sign a written settlement . All other records are destroyed , on the theory that confidentiality will help cement the deal . <P> Some states are experimenting with a more formal kind of out-of-court settlement procedure called arbitration , in which the counselor , rather than the parties themselves , crafts the solution . California , for example , uses this system to handle certain medical malpractice claims . Both arbitration and mediation help clear court dockets of many minor cases . They also often save money : in the Columbus program , the cost of the average agreement , including the mediators ' pay , is $20 , vs. $250 for the typical court case . But mediation does not promise to break the nation 's litigation logjam . Says William Yeomans , a Justice Department expert on such programs :        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
