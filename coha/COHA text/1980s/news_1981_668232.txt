They never could fully appreciate this day in Orange or Broward Counties , Topeka or Tenafly . No matter what was muttered all winter , no matter if Haywood and Buddy had turned Symphony Hall into a punk disco , Opening Day is New England ' sregeneration after the sterility of its winter . A block away , the daffodils blossomed in The Fens , and , from there to Yawkey way , they were lined up at 10:30 yesterday morning , some selling " Haywood and Buddy Are Killing The Sox " bumper stickers , others selling pictures of Yaz and Dewey , all waiting in line for the first 6-3 of spring , more people ( 35,343 ) than had been to an opener here since 1969 . What they had awaited turned out to be , in the words of one Dennis Eckersley , " a fairy tale . " For anyone of positive instincts , this was one of Fenway ' s most memorable openers : from a brilliant pitching duel between Eckersley and Britt Burns to a 2-0 Boston lead on Dwight Evans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ace Ed Farmer getting Joe Rudi with two on in the ninth for the 5-3 Chicago victory . But what happened in between was an hallucination from the mind of a farmer from Charlestown , N.H. , for Carlton Fisk returned en route to Chicago to beat that two-run Red Sox lead with an eighth-inning , three-run homer off his friend Bob Stanley that anyone but Fisk ' s most infirm antagonist would grant as the highest drama ( hello Chicago , goodby old friends ) in a most exciting game . Not that the entire game was one of baroque perfection ; the Red Sox had 3 errors , 3 stolen bases against them , 2 hit batsmen and watched 2 windblown pop flies land untouched , while Chicago made three errors and kept the beer sales going through the bottom of the ninth with a leadoff walk and crucial error that forced Farmer to come in and get a Boston hitter ( Rudi ) who is swinging the bat as well as anyone . But Eckersley and Burns were just plain dazzling . Granted , for the first five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The glare off the ball was so bright that you ' d hope they ' d find a darker ball " - Evans ) , but both pitchers just kept making one outstanding pitch after another . " I was a little surprised , " said The Eck . " I had an especially good breaking ball , and when I had to make good pitches , they came . " Ron LeFlore ( two hits , a speed-forced error ) was on second , none out in the first after a single and Eck ' s errant pickoff attempt , and the Red Sox ace blew down Mike Squires , Fisk and Greg Luzinski ( who , after a three-strikeout , 0-for-4 day heard a " Welcome to the American League " from LeFlore ) . A walk and one of the two popups that blew back over Glenn Hoffman ' s head created a none- out jam Eckersley breezed through in the second , and from there through the seventh - ah , The Eck gave it a gecksture when he punched out Fisk in the sixth ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eck ) he had a three-hit shutout , and two of the three hits were the popups . But Burns , the best rookie pitcher in baseball last year , was damn near as good . What made him so very difficult were his curveballs , one slow and tantalizing , the other hard and angular ; he threw both for strikes , ahead or behind , and both came out of both the crowd and the scoreboard . " I didn ' t rely as much on the breaking ball last year , " said the 21-year-old from Birmingham , Ala. , " but I was going with what was working . " Anyway , Fisk wanted him throwing the breaking ball in big situations even if these Red Sox seemed more patient than the usual first-ball , fastball-hitting team they ' ve been . In his 6 2/3 innings , Burns struck out eight , his career high . But in the fifth , after dropping over a 2-0 offspeed curve , Burns tried to sneak a fastball past Evans . It banged off the front door of Spit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the man who hit six homers in spring training . In the seventh , Allenson drove his first homer since August 1979 , with the wind , into the Boston bullpen , and after a walk , an error and with Rudi - who ' d ripped two line drives - White Sox manager Tony LaRussa went to Lamar ( Dewey ) Hoyt . By the eighth , Eckersley , too had begun tiring . " My shoulder got a little stiff after the fifth , " said Eckersley . Evidence : he walked leadoff pinch hitter Bob Molinaro . LeFlore singled . Enter Stanley . " He ' d been our strongest in Florida , and they had a lot of righthanded hitters , " explained Ralph Houk , so Stanley got Squires ' perfect sacrifice bunt and prepared for Fisk with the tying run at second bare . Fisk said he went up to the plate " looking for Bobby ' s sinker , because it ' s about the best , and looking to hack . " Allenson and Stanley said they thought of starting him off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A lot more homers are hit off Stanley ' s slider than his sinker , " said Allenson . " This wasn ' t one of his better sinkers . " " I had to go at him , " explained Stanley . " My best against his best , because I know he ' s a lowball hitter . It wasn ' t that bad a pitch , it ' s just Pudge . Not many guys could have done what he did . " Well , it was a pitch down and in from Pat Darcy in October , 1975 , and it was a sinker from Stanley that flattened out and didn ' t run in as much as he wanted . Fisk waited , jumped on it and lined it towards The Wall . " I didn ' t think it was out , " said Fisk , " until I got to second and saw the umpire ( Dale Ford ) waving me around . " The ball caromed off the top of the fence , up into the screen , and it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you knew it would be . But it also wasn ' t over . Look , there will be better days for the Red Sox players , particularly Allenson . In the ninth , Chicago got two more runs when Jim Morrison got jammed so badly that part of his bat got to Carney Lansford quicker than the ball - hit - and Tony Bernazard singled him to third . Bernazard ran to second , stopped to create the rundown and double steal , and Allenson ' s throw bounced into center field . A bunt and a grounder later , it was 5-3 . Still , it wasn ' t over . Hoyt had done a superb job , adding four strikeouts to Burns ' eight , but he also walked pinch hitter Garry Hancock leading off the bottom of the ninth . Here , Houk did not pinch hit for Allenson , even with Jerry Remy available , but that is Houk . He is not afraid to lose a game , and Allenson is his catcher , and he will show him faith that will keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Houk had his reason . Bernazard then recreated the nightmare that has plagued these Chicago pitchers , booting Rick Miller ' s routine grounder , and , after Hoyt popped Evans up , Dave Stapleton battled from 0-2 to single in the third run . Enter Farmer . " I made what I thought was a helluva pitch to Rudi , " said Farmer , and Rudi flied the curveball to center field . No one out across the sun and grain belts would have understood , but no one in the bleachers cares about sun and grain belts . Spring has returned , and so hath Carlton Fisk , and he has done too much for too long for the people that do understand to have made anyone anything but a little bit happy .
