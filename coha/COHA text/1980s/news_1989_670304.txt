When Wackenhut Corp. hired Edward DeSantis in 1981 to run its Houston office , he signed an agreement not to compete with the security-service company for two years after leaving the firm . But a month after his departure in 1984 , Mr. DeSantis started soliciting Wackenhut ' s customers for his own security business . Wackenhut sued him in state court in Houston , alleging , among other things , that he breached the " non-compete " contract . Last July , the Texas Supreme Court ruled the company couldn ' t stop him . In fact , it said Wackenhut was liable for damages because its non-compete agreement violated Texas restraint-of-trade laws . And it said triple damages could be warranted in some instances  --  although not in the Wackenhut case . " That ' s a big concern to every employer in the state that has a non-compete agreement with its employees , " says Richard Kobdish , an attorney with Johnson &; Swanson , a law firm in Dallas . Court rulings on non-compete agreements worry employers in a lot of states these days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain prized employees , the agreements generally have gotten sympathetic treatment from courts over the years . Many still do . Increasingly , though , judges are looking at the non-compete agreements with more skepticism , finding that such contracts frequently go too far in restraining employees . In some cases , they are modifying the terms to make them less restrictive . In others , they are simply tossing out the agreements . " Courts are giving more critical scrutiny to the reasonableness of the language , " says Joseph W. Ambash , an attorney at Day , Berry &; Howard in Boston . " Employers have to draft these agreements with much greater precision . " The danger of drafting a non-compete agreement imprecisely is clear : A judge may interpret it in a way the employer didn ' t intend . That ' s what General Motors Corp. learned last October when GM ' s Electronic Data Systems Corp. subsidiary sued H. Ross Perot , former GM director and chairman and chief executive of EDS , in a state circuit court in Fairfax , Va. , alleging that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left GM in 1986 , he agreed not to compete for profit with EDS until Dec. 1 , 1989 . What that means , GM told a Virginia judge in trying to stop a new Perot company from soliciting EDS customers , is that Mr. Perot can only do charitable work in the data-processing field . If that ' s so , " Why didn ' t they say so specifically " in the non-compete agreement , the judge wondered during the hearing . " That ' s the easy , simple English that would have said what they wanted . " What the pact does mean , he ruled , is that Mr. Perot can sign not-for-profit contracts until next Dec. 1 , then subsequently turn those contracts into profitable ones . Whatever judges are deciding , they are having to rule more often . The work force is more mobile these days , and thus , non-compete clauses get contested more often . Some people also believe the scrutiny reflects a broader trend in which courts are viewing employee rights more favorably  --  upholding claims of wrongful discharge and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court rulings vary . In Texas , business interests are so concerned that they are seeking legislation to reinforce employers ' rights to enforce non-compete agreements . At the least , though , lawyers are advising company clients to review their contracts to make sure they ' re defensible . In some instances , they ' re suggesting toned-down language to minimize the chances a judge will feel an employee is being denied his right to work . " A well-advised employer no longer wants to terrorize his employees into not competing by drawing a broad document that would basically put them out of the field where they earn their livelihood , " says James Hautzinger , an attorney with Sherman &; Howard in Denver . Some kinds of non-compete pacts stand a better chance in court than others . One example : where the seller of a business has promised not to compete with the buyer . Covenants deemed necessary to protect an employer ' s trade secrets also get favorable treatment . Last March , a state appeals court in St. Louis upheld a non-compete pact against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidential paint formulas , customer lists and pricing data . The court ruled that such information qualified as trade secrets that warranted protection . But many judges come down hard on non-compete contracts they feel do little more than guard an employer ' s turf . Modern Telecommunications Inc. ran into that problem when it sued to stop two former employees from performing video-production work for a competitor . Last May , a New York state appeals court refused to uphold the agreement , saying , among other things , that there wasn ' t any evidence that trade secrets were at stake . In fact , the court concluded , " the plaintiff apparently is primarily interested in protecting what plaintiff refers to as its ' investment ' in its clients . " Judges also examine how long an employee is barred from competing . Years ago , lawyers insist , some agreements contained lifetime bans . Now , periods of six months to two years are common . Mr. Hautzinger says he ' s rarely drawn one of more than a year in recent times . The geographic scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s original contract , for instance , prohibited him from competing in 40 counties around Houston . The trial judge trimmed that to 13 before the state Supreme Court invalidated the pact altogether . Paul Thompson , an attorney with Hunton &; Williams in Richmond , recalls a Virginia company that tried to ban a former salesman who worked in Roanoke from competing anywhere in the state . A court-approved compromise barred him in Roanoke , but let him work in another Virgina city . " The courts really balance the equities lots of times , " says Mr. Thompson . " Is it reasonable ? Is it fair ? As you can imagine , different judges have different ideas . " How the court sizes up an employer ' s motives can also affect the outcome . Mr. Thompson saw it work against a food company he once battled on behalf of a former salesman who had been hired by a competitor . After concluding that employee movement is common in the highly competitive food industry , the judge surmised that the employer ' s main objective in going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mr. Thompson says . A judge may also be influenced by whether an employee got anything in return for signing an agreement not to compete . Last January , in a case involving a route salesman for a dry-cleaning company , a Pennsylvania Superior Court said just getting a job is sufficient to warrant a covenant not to compete . But most courts require that the employee receive more  --  some sort of specialized job training , for example . In ruling against Wackenhut , the Texas Supreme Court noted that Mr. DeSantis had more than 14 years of experience in the security business before joining Wackenhut , and thus " there is no evidence that DeSantis obtained any special knowledge or training from Wackenhut . " " Perhaps a company could make a case if a guy is selling complicated computer equipment which takes a great deal of training , " says Mr. Kobdish . " But just hiring someone and putting him on the payroll and utilizing sales skills he could have gotten anywhere-that won ' t cut it . " Perhaps most worrisome to employers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at whether the non-compete pacts are reasonable , but whether they are unenforceable simply because they prevent a person from making a living . The Alabama Supreme Court , for instance , last January invalidated a noncompete clause that Copy Products Co. of Mobile sought to enforce against William Chavers , a copier technician . " Though he is a highly skilled working man , he is nevertheless still only a working man , " the court said . Noting that this was his only trade and sole means of support , the court concluded that " such people can not be prevented from plying their trades by blanket " post-employment restraints . Several months earlier , the Texas Supreme Court similarly had ruled that noncompete agreements aren ' t enforceable in Texas when they restrict a person ' s right to engage in a " common " calling . The court didn ' t define the term ; the case involved an auto trim shop employee . When the court subsequently concluded in the DeSantis case that an employee can collect triple damages if an employer restrains him in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brightened considerably for Texas workers bound by such covenants . " Five years ago , if you had a non-compete agreement , you were stuck with it  --  it didn ' t matter if you were a widget maker or a nuclear scientist , " says Robert Bambace , an attorney in Houston with Fulbright &; Jaworski . " But that ' s all changing . " Credit : Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal
