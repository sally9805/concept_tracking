" This is it for Lefty , is n't it ? " Philadelphia outfielder Jeff Stone was voicing everyone 's thoughts as No. 32 , Steve Carlton , took the mound for the Phillies against the St. Louis Cardinals last Friday afternoon in Clearwater , Fla . Though Lance Parrish was making his debut as the Phillies ' catcher , attention was focused on Carlton , 42 , the 10th-winningest pitcher in major league history , who was getting his fifth  --  and probably last  --  chance of the spring to defy time . // The Phillies had already said goodbye to Carlton once before , nine months ago . The Giants picked him up on July 4 , but released him on Aug. 7 . Then it was over to the American League , where he spent 54 days with the White Sox . Through it all , Carlton never got the message . He spent the winter calling around and telling teams , " I 'm throwing better than I have since 1984 . " That year Carlton finished 13-7 with a 3.58 ERA , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was generally thought to be washed up . But because the Phillies owe him so much and because their pitching is n't exactly set , they agreed to give Carlton an unpaid tryout this spring . // When Carlton arrived in Clearwater , manager John Felske made it clear that the tryout would consist of just five appearances . In the first , an intrasquad game , Carlton , pitching for both sides , was battered for six runs in one inning . " He did n't throw in the game the way he did on the side , " said one Phillies official . " Sometimes it 's hard getting up when you 're pitching to your teammates. " // Then came a two-inning Grapefruit League stint against the Blue Jays , which Carlton survived on guile . His fastball was clocked at no better than 84 miles per hour , but George Bell and Jesse Barfield could n't get good swings against him . // In Carlton 's next start , against the Reds , he gave up three runs in the first . " Lefty threw the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lefty threw the ball better after the first inning , " said Felske . Facing the Pirates on March 15 , Carlton gave up four runs in four innings , but two of them were unearned . // As usual , Carlton was n't talking about anything , but he did indicate he would open up some if his comeback proved successful . One day last week he walked by two media people , smiled and said , " I 'm trying everything now  --  screwball , forkball , changeups  --  but I 'm throwing good . It 's coming . " // The problem was that Carlton 's arm had lost its resiliency . He could throw on the side and approach 90 mph , but his next fastball would be below 80 . The slider was still good , but as Lefty admitted years ago , 80% of his strikeouts came on pitches that ran out of the strike zone , and now hitters are n't so intimidated . They let the slider swerve out of the strike zone  --  and wait for a 42-year-old man 's fastball. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pitcher 's death knell when he said , " We have a great chance to win . We ca n't be waiting for promises . " // Carlton looked like the same old Lefty  --  the rolling motion , the perfect rhythm  --  as he delivered his first pitch to Cardinal leadoff batter Vince Coleman . But the pitch almost hit him . Then Coleman ripped the second pitch to the base of the leftfield fence . Next , Carlton walked Ozzie Smith on four pitches . His first two pitches to Tommy Herr were balls . // " This is n't the way to prove that he can still pitch , " said one Phillie veteran , shaking his head . Coleman and Smith pulled off a double steal . Herr hit a sacrifice fly to deep center . Jack Clark ripped a vicious one-hopper at shortstop Steve Jeltz to drive in Smith , and it was 2-0 . The Cardinals  --  the team that had brought Carlton to the majors 22 years ago  --  were delivering the bad news . // Carlton worked four more innings , striking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one more earned run , a line drive homer by Mike LaValliere . " He looked all right to me , " said Parrish . " He was throwing the ball pretty well . " // Carlton did throw some pitches well : a fastball past Herr , two sharp-breaking sliders to strike out Andy Van Slyke . Only 40 of his 82 pitches were strikes . When Lefty was finished , he strode down the rightfield line to respectful applause , but one foghorn voice shouted , " Hang it up , old man . " // About being an aging player , reliever Bill Campbell , 38 and giving it one last shot with the Expos , says , " You need to have hitters prove to you that you ca n't get them out anymore , and you ca n't live with yourself until they have . It 's one thing to wake up one morning and know that it 's over . But it would be worse waking up one night thinking that it should n't be over . " // And so , for Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision . After the game Giles summoned Felske , pitching coach Claude Osteen and four other members of the baseball staff to a conference room . He gave each of them a slip of paper listing two handwritten choices , one reading ANOTHER START , the other , LET HIM GO . When Giles counted the ballots , there was only a single ANOTHER START . // Felske gave Carlton the official word on Saturday morning . " What was said is strictly between Steve and me , " Felske said . // Weeks before , Carlton had told a friend , " I have n't even thought about what I might do after baseball , because I know I can still pitch . " As Phillie reliever Steve Bedrosian had said , " You do n't win 300 games giving in to anything . " // So off Carlton went , in search of another team . Oakland , which has lost three starters since the beginning of spring training , is a potential spot , but so far even the Athletics have left Lefty alone . For Steve Carlton @ @ @ @ @ @ @
