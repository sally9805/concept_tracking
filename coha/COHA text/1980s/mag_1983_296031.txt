THE OUTSIDERS Directed by Francis Coppola Screenplay by Kathleen Knutsen Rowell <P> " He 's so greasy he glides when he walks . " This is Tulsa 1966 , where lines of class and style are drawn as sharply as in any war , and there is no demilitarized zone . On one side is the " greaser , " teen descendant of Elvis , Brando and James Dean ; poor white trash and proud of it . On the other side is the " soc " ( rhymes with gauche ) , spiffy as Pat Boone , sweet and snooty as Sandra Dee . The greasers are wild boys of the road , skipping school , making small trouble , ignoring their parents or forced to live without them . <P> The rival groups taunt and threaten each other ; once in a while they rumble ; sometimes a flare of gang anger can lead to sudden death . One such incident sends two greasers , Ponyboy ( C. Thomas Howell ) and Johnny ( Ralph Macchio ) , on a trek away from Tulsa to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting hurt . Another greaser , Dallas ( Matt Dillon ) , provides a role model for sexy self-destruction . The bleak moral of Francis Coppola 's movie , based on an S.E. Hinton novel that has sold 4 million copies in the U.S. , is that you can do good or do bad-but everybody dies . <P> The greasers ' turf is the north side of Tulsa : the socs occupy the south . But The Outsiders ' sensibility is operatic enough to make the film into another West Side Story . From its first frames , when Stevie Wonder croons a pop ballad over images of suburban sunsets , Coppola sets the tone of poetic realism , Hollywood style . The greasers , with their sleek muscles and androgynous faces , display a leonine athleticism as they move through dusty lots or do a graceful , two-handed vault over a chain-link fence . Their camaraderie is familial , embracing , unselfconsciously homoerotic . Left to their better selves , they can easily go all moony over sunsets , quote great swatches of Robert Frost verse , or fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world is both a womb and a locker room ; no women need apply to this dreamy brother hood . With its soft , silvery lighting , its slow fades and dissolves and a lush score ( by Carmine Coppola , the director 's father ) , The Outsiders means to create the greasers ' dream world even as it describes the real world in which they live and die . <P> After the life-or-death marketing of Apocalypse Now and One from the Heart , it is refreshing to come upon a Coppola film that is , bless it , only a movie . Alas , The Outsiders is not quite a good one . Because it falls in with the undulating rhythm of the life of its heroes , for whom a fatal fight and a quiet night have almost equal importance , the picture never manages to reach the peaks of satisfying Hollywood melodrama . Nor are the greasers romanticized enough to be seen as avatars of the outlaw lovers in Frank Borzage 's Moonrise or Nicholas Ray 's They Live by Night . Like the greasers , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Coppola , however , is generous with his fine young actors ( excepting Dillon , whose coltish charm is fast becoming a festival of Method mannerisms ) . It is easy to sense Coppola 's identification with these boys , and with the feeling of going it alone against all odds that has made this protean writer-director-producer Hollywood 's most famous and flamboyant outsider . - By Richard Corliss
