White House sources said today that President Reagan would announce the program , which would force payment through financial penalties and court claims , on March 10 in the second major budget message of his Administration. // Meanwhile , Democratic members of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress , taking issue with the President ' s economic program , called for more moderate monetary and budget policies . ( Page D1. ) // // Meeting to Weigh New Cuts // Mr. Reagan is scheduled to meet with the budget director , David A. Stockman , at 2 P.M. tomorrow to hear Mr. Stockman ' s recommendations for a total of $10 billion to $13 billion in spending cuts that Mr. Reagan is to announce on March 10 to meet his goal of a Federal spending ceiling of $695. 5 billion in the fiscal year 1982 . Supplemental appropriations are planned , however , for the Board for International Broadcasting , which supervises Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. // In the March 10 message , Mr. Reagan also plans to announce the effort to eliminate waste and fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sources said . They indicated that Mr. Reagan would ask each department to try to trim its budget by onehalf of 1 percent to a full percentage point by eliminating waste and theft. // Mr. Reagan is to be joined by his Cabinet members tomorrow at the White House session with Mr. Stockman . The meeting has taken on increased importance since the announcement yesterday that the Office of Management and Budget had underestimated the growth in Government spending for 1982 by several billion dollars. // This forced a choice on Mr. Reagan yesterday : either to abandon his $695. 5 billion ceiling on spending or to authorize spending reductions beyond the $41. 4 billion he announced on Feb. 18 in his first budget address. // In that speech , Mr. Reagan gave details on $34. 4 billion of his $41. 4 billion in recommended spending cuts and promised details on the remaining $7 billion on March 10 . But , because of the miscalculation disclosed yesterday , the President is to announce $3 billion to $6 billion additional in cuts on March 10 to meet his overall goal. // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts would be made across the board rather than by deep reductions in a few programs. // Mr. Reagan is pledged to preserve seven basic social welfare programs , such as Social Security and Medicare , the health-care program for the elderly . But Mr. Stockman is expected to recommend more cuts in some programs that aid the poor . For example , the financing of the Comprehensive Education and Training Act employment programs , already cut from a projected $3. 8 billion to $206 million for the fiscal year 1982 , is likely to be cut even further , the sources said . They also said that more cuts were expected in educational programs and agricultural subsidies. // The Reagan Administration continued its effort today to blame the Carter Administration for the miscalculation in the growth of 1982 spending , some of it mandated by Congress to keep programs in step with inflation . " They had , if you will pardon the expression , too rosy a scenario , " said Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan of the budget projections that President Carter ' s staff left behind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in remarks to reporters at the White House , also identified Carter figures as the problem . " You bet we can , " he responded when asked if he could still reach his goals , " just as soon as the bureaucracy finds out how wrong its figures are. " // But a senior Carter Administration official responded today by attributing the error to " two different Reagan estimates , " adding that the Reagan budget team had moved " too fast " and simply made a mistake . <> <> ' The Same People ' and Process // " They have the same people doing the estimate for them that President Carter had doing them for him and the same process for making estimates , " added James T. McIntyre Jr. , the Carter budget director. // In describing the new " accelerated debt collection " program today , one White House official referred to the uncollected loans as an undeveloped Government " asset . " In the past , he added , there was little effort to track down delinquent recipients of such loans. // " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another White House staff member in reference to the loans . " You can also raise the interest . You can raise the penalty . You can also raise the penalty on late Internal Revenue Service payments . That ' s being considered. " // He added that the Reagan Administration did not envision a policelike enforcement effort so much as the use of penalties , fines and the threat of legal action " to create a climate in which people feel they ' ve got to pay loans . " <> <> No Breakdown on Loans Owed // Student loans were cited as the type of loan most frequently delinquent , but White House officials provided no breakdown today as to the numbers and dollar amounts of the student , agricultural or small business loans in default. // The Reagan Administration has insisted that politics has figured very little in its budget deliberations , but foreign policy apparently influenced the as-yet unannounced decision to award supplemental appropriations to the Board for International Broadcasting , which supervises Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty. // According to Administration officials , the radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union , are to receive $3 million in addition to the present $99. 7 million budget in the fiscal year 1981 . For the fiscal year 1982 , there will be a supplement of $4 million to the $94. 3 million request for next year. // A budget official said the request for more funding for the radio services was forwarded from Richard V. Allen , the President ' s national security adviser , to Edwin Meese 3d , the counselor to the President . From there , it went to Mr. Stockman in a move that the budget official said signaled that " the President himself is interested in getting the message out " in Communist countries. //
