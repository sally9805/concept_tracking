Child care centers have been operating for more than 17 years at Harvard , a pioneer in providing child care for employees . But many of Harvard ' s clerical and technical workers charge that the way the system works symbolizes Harvard ' s insensitivity to their needs. // Spaces for children at the centers are scarce , and the cost is beyond the reach of many secretaries , researchers , librarians and museum curatorial assistants. // While many unions have raised the issue of child care in bargaining for new contracts , the organizing effort under way here by the American Federation of State , County and Municipal Employees , is one of the first built around the issue of affordable child care . <> <> A Vast Organizing Effort // The 1. 1-million-member union has 16 full-time organizers working at Harvard on a budget of about $500 , 000 year. // If the union ' s campaign succeeds , it is expected to strengthen the resolve of union organizing efforts at other universities as well in industry . Union officials say they hope their campaign here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run by men for men. // Harvard clerical workers earn an average of about $18 , 000 a year . Union organizers say the cost at the university ' s seven day care centers averages about $750 a month . University officials estimate that it is somewhat less than that. // Even if they could afford the centers , many workers said , they would have little chance of finding a place for their child . There are 338 spaces , but at least that number of children on waiting lists , according to union organizers. // The organizing effort is attempting to add 3 , 700 new members , predominantly white collar and female , to its rolls . The issue of affordable child care appears to be paying off . The union announced this week that a majority of eligible workers had signed cards calling for union representation and that it would file for a federally supervised union election within several weeks . The new union would be the Harvard Union Clerical and Technical Workers . <> <> Union Effort a Year Old // There are already seven unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current organizing effort has been under way for about a year. // " We are not just singling out Harvard as a bad employer , " said Kris Rondeau , a 35-year old former Harvard medical technician who directs the organizing efforts . " The issues they face here are the same working women face all over the country. " // For decades , unions showed little interest in organizing office workers , most of whom are women . When they did try , their efforts often failed , as they had at Harvard over the last several years . Moreover , women have often been relegated to secondary roles in unions , heading such activities as education or recreation. // Only 15 percent or less of office workers are organized nationwide . <> <> ' We ' re Working on It ' // Even Harvard officials agree that the child care facilities are now inadequate . Anne Taylor , special assistant for the vice president for finance , said : " It isn ' t enough , and we ' re working on it . But it ' s a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " // Harvard officials are opposed to the organizing drive because they believe a union for clerical and technical workers is unnecessary . But they said they would not interfere with the effort. // " We don ' t want a union - we ' re not shy about that , " said Ms. Taylor , who is also the Harvard spokesman on union issues . " We don ' t think unionization would enhance our ability to manage the university in the best possible way. // " There are things about unionization that our support staff should understand ; it is not a cost-free proposition . I think a lot of them have never worked in a unionized environmenment , and they should understand that. " // David Williams , an audio-visual technician at Harvard Law School , said one of Harvard ' s centers had an opening for his son , Benjamin , who was then 14 months old , for $825 a month . He said he and his wife , Ellen Royalty , who works outside the university , could not possibly afford that rate. // A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benjamin with him to work , which he did regularly for nearly nine months , often to the distraction of other workers . The other day , Benjamin , now 20 months old , was again playing noisely in an adjoining law school office. // Asked what he thought of Harvard as an employer , Mr. Williams spoke bitterly of the sacrifices he has made as a working father. // " I hate their paternalism " he said . " That ' s all Harvard is about . Their attitude is that they know what ' s best for us ; they say we do more than a lot of other universities and corporations , but then you look at the waiting list , and it ' s three times longer than the spaces available , and you know that child care is obviously not a priority for Harvard. " // Union officials said that some employees had become so fearful of not having child care at Harvard that they placed their names on waiting lists even before giving birth , in the hopes that they could afford it . <> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point out that the first day care center here was established long before most major corporations and universities had them. // Indeed , only 3 , 300 companies out of an estimated 46 , 000 mid-to-large-size concerns in the United States currently provide any child care assistance , according to a survey released last October by Summa Associates , a child care planning concern based in Los Angeles. // Others maintain that with its enormous prestige , its connections and resources , Harvard should be at the forefront on the child care issue , a beacon , so to speak , for other employers . <> <> ' Significant Amount of Money ' // Karen Walz , for example , a staff assistant at the law school ' s human rights program , said she did not even bother to apply to the Harvard centers because of the long waiting lists and the costs. // " At a professor ' s salary , they probably wouldn ' t feel the bite in their budget as badly , but for people who are support staff here , it ' s a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difference between even being able to pay the rent. " // Instead of the Harvard centers , Ms. Walz said , she sends her son to another day care facility , at a slightly lower cost , in Lexington , Mass . Even then , she said that most of salary , about $13 , 000 , goes to day care and other child-rearing expenses. // " I ' m absolutely convinced that Harvard can do better , " Ms. Walz said , " And it ' s not so much that we ' re demanding that they do better , we want to help them do better , and we really want to partners with Harvard on this , for the good of everyone.
