The towering Mauna Kea , a 13,800-ft. extinct volcano in Hawaii , is a peculiar mix of the exotic . Gnarled koa trees twist up from its tropical slopes , where the endangered palila bird , a tiny yellow honey creeper , crushes rock-hard mamane seeds with its beak . But up on top , science has taken over . Because the exceptionally dry and stable atmosphere over Mauna Kea makes the site among the world 's best spots for star gazing , six telescopes have been built on the volcano 's crest , and two more are under construction . <P> Now an extraordinary newcomer will join that celestial company . The California Institute of Technology , working with the University of California , will build the world 's biggest optical telescope on the volcano 's crest ; construction could begin as early as 1986 . The mammoth instrument , made possible by a $70 million grant to Caltech by the W.M. Keck Foundation , will have an innovative mirror system nearly 400 in. in diameter , which is twice the width and has four times the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200-in . Hale device at Mount Palomar , Calif . When astronomers begin using the new telescope in 1992 , it will push back the visible limits of the universe by billions of light years . Says Howard Keck , president of the foundation : " I 'm told it will permit one to see the light of a single candle from the distance of the moon . " <P> The Keck telescope , as it will be called , is the first of a new generation of extra-large telescopes designed to overcome construction problems that have dogged sky gazers since before the Hale was dedicated in 1948 . Photons ( massless particles that transmit light ) from an ancient galaxy may travel billions of light years through space before they speed down a telescope tube . But unless enough of them are collected , astronomers will not be able to see the galaxy 's image . Gathering sufficient photons to register an image is accomplished by either taking long-exposure photographs or using a larger mirror system to collect the light . Many astronomical photographs already take hours to make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a clear view of very faint objects . Hence the need for bigger mirrors . Complains Palomar Observatory Director Gerry Neugebauer : " We 're photon starved . " <P> Yet conventional telescopes can not be simply scaled up indefinitely . As the mirrors get bigger , they begin to sag under their own weight . Indeed , for years many astronomers believed that a 200-in. diameter was the practical limit for an optical telescope . <P> The advent of the computer has changed all that . Led by Astrophysicist Jerry Nelson , a team at the University of California designed an unorthodox mirror that will not be a continuous concave surface , like Hale 's , but 36 hexagonal pieces of specially shaped glass , each 6 ft. across and 3 in. thick ; the segments will be fit together and will move in concert to act as one giant parabolic mirror . That harmony is possible only with the aid of a computer- controlled sensing and positioning system , which will realign the components 100 times a second by as little as one one-thousandth the width of a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
