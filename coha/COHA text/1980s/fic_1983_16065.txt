Whipple nods knowingly at the screen as the numbers flash and change . He glances at several graphs on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then leans back with a dreamy smile on his face , full of self-satisfaction .

Then these two men in their 70 's go through their version of a " high five .

When Whipple is gone , the Dukes lower their reading matter . &nbsp; MORTIMERWhipple 's a very solid young man . We 're lucky to have him managing the firm for us . &nbsp; RANDOLPHOh , hogwash !

Billy Ray calmly empties the contents of the drawer onto the desk . &nbsp; BILLY RAYReally . I caught this man planting these things in my desk .

They ca n't see Billy Ray 's feet because they 're on top of the seat . &nbsp; RANDOLPHPay up , Mortimer . I 've won the bet . BILLY RAY struggling to hold in the smoke , listens popeyed to their conversation , completely puzzled . A SULKING MORTIMER takes out his wallet , removes a bill and hands it to his brother . We see that it 's a one dollar bill . There 's something particularly nasty about the fact that the Dukes have fomented all this trouble for a single dollar . They walk over to the urinals , and unzip to take a leak . &nbsp; RANDOLPHI thought our experiment went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly useless psychopath like Valentine and turned him into a successful executive .

I think the Nobel Prize people are going to be very impressed indeed . They zip up , adjourn to the sinks , to wash their hands and groom themselves . &nbsp; MORTIMERThat 's all very well , Randolph . But what are you going to do about taking Whipple back and returning Valentine to the ghetto ? BILLY RAY swallows the smoke and nearly begins coughing as he starts to realize what they 've done . &nbsp; RANDOLPH ( O.S. ) Mmm . . . I had n't really thought of that . It should n't be much of a problem . Whipple ought to be most grateful to reassume his position , and as for Valentine , I 'm sure we can find him something at the club . &nbsp; MORTIMER ( O.S. ) He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O.S. ) Excellent idea .

No sense rocking the boat until then . &nbsp; RANDOLPHI think that if Mr. Beeks does what we 've paid him to do , we should have a very happy New Year . &nbsp; MORTIMER ( chuckling ) Indeed . The Duke brothers reprise their version of the " high five " and saunter out of the men 's room . THE STALL DOOR OPENS and Billy Ray Valentine walks out , with a look of determination on his face .

Whipple takes a very long swig from the brandy bottle and jams it in his pocket . What he does n't realize is that his coat is now open , and the two pistols stuck in his waistband are visible . The Mother notices them and then so do the other passengers . Everyone gets up and edges towards the doors .

Wonderful . The flashlight beam goes off , leaving the Dukes in darkness once again . The only SOUND is Billy Ray 's FOOTSTEPS moving away from them . &nbsp; MORTIMER ( calling after him ) Beeks !

Billy Ray glances nervously at Whipple who is staring straight ahead like a man with a mission . Whipple can already taste his coming triumph over the Dukes . He does n't deign to answer Billy Ray 's question . Instead , he simply holds out his palm which Billy Ray slaps . Billy Ray holds out his palm for Whipple to slap , but Whipple misses and has to do it again . Coleman steps forward and gives Billy Ray an attache case . Billy Ray opens it and smiles at the cash inside . &nbsp; COLEMANMy life savings , sir .

CHICAGO BOARD OF TRADE - MORNING The 64 story monolithic building  --  the last bastion of pure capitalism and home of the biggest crap shoot in the world  --  looms above the corner of La Salle and Jackson . A fleet of ostentatious luxury automobiles is depositing the traders and brokers arriving for work . Hordes of people are pouring in off the side-walks . You can feel the rising tension  --  it 's almost like the tension before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND MORTIMER get out of a stretch limousine , accompanied by a retinue of aides and flunkies . The Dukes look supremely confident . Their arrival creates an immediate stir . It 's as if the Hunt brothers were showing up . A Board of Trade Official hurries out , and obsequiously ushers them inside . A DELAPIDATED TAXI pulls up and Billy Ray and Whipple get out . Whipple opens his attache case and throws the stunned driver a hundred dollar bill . &nbsp; LOUISKeep the change . Billy Ray is staring up at the intimidating skyscraper , and then at the grim-faced brokers with growing alarm . Whipple grasps him firmly by the elbow and leads him towards the entrance . Whipple is like some athlete going into a self-induced trance before the big game . &nbsp; LOUIS ( continuing ) Think big , think positive . Never show weakness , always go for the throat . Buy low and sell high .  --  143  --  Fear ? That 's the other guy 's problem . CUT TO : INT .

One minute you 're up a half a million in soybeans , the next minute , BOOM , your kids do n't go to college , they 've repossessed your Bentley . Are you with me ?

They work for the Exchange . Whipple opens a locker and hands Billy Ray a cherry red coat and puts one on himself . He leads Billy Ray into . . . THE BATHROOM where a host of traders and brokers , also in cherry red jackets , are preparing themselves for the coming ordeal . A lot of them sport funny hats and ties to distinguish themselves on the trading floor . &nbsp; LOUISThis is the enemy . Whipple goes over to a basin and begins compulsively washing his hands . Billy Ray follows suit . Behind them , all the urinals and toilet stalls are in use , and from the SOUND of things , there are a lot of NERVOUS STOMACHS in the room . In fact , just about all the people there seem to be in a state bordering on a nervous breakdown . People are wolfing down pills and Alka-Seltzer , doing loosening-up exercises in the mirror , hyperventilating , pacing the floor , chain-smoking . TRADER #1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another of cocaine from a phial into his nose . TRADER #2 , next to Whipple , is washing down vitamin pills with shooters of " Wild Turkey .

Whipple turns to Billy Ray . &nbsp; LOUISLet 's kick some ass . CUT TO : Section Details INT . TRADING ROOM FLOOR - DAY Some 4,000 people are packed into an area about the size of a football field . They 're swarming around the various octagonal " pits " where the different commodities are traded . The place is without windows , chairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a massive array of tiered cubicles , each belonging to a broker , containing telephones and computer consoles . One whole wall is devoted to a vast ELECTRONIC BOARD that quotes the changing prices for the various commodities . At the moment , it is still . Overlooking the floor is a VISTIORS GALLERY , where  --  RANDOLPH AND MORTIMER DUKE are huddling with their floor broker , WILSON , a preppy Ivy Leaguer even in his cherry red coat . &nbsp; RANDOLPHWe want you to buy as much o. j. as you can , the instant trading starts . &nbsp; MORTIMERDo n't worry if the price starts going up . Just keep buying . &nbsp; WILSON ( stunned ) But , gentlemen , they 're going to broadcast the Crop Report in an hour . What if  --  ? &nbsp; RANDOLPHLet us worry about that , Wilson . Wilson finally realizes the Dukes have an inside tip .  --  146  --  He looks at them with admiration and smiles . &nbsp; WILSONYes , sir . CUT TO : THE FROZEN ORANGE JUICE PIT Every inch around the pit is taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commencement of business . A huge CLOCK on the wall TICKS down the final seconds until 9:00 A.M. Whipple and Billy Ray are edging their way into the pit . They glance up at  --  THE BOARD where the price of " APRIL OJ " is set to open at $1.02/ pound . BACK TO THE OJ PIT There 's a hush of palpable expectation , something akin to the moment right before the opening kickoff of a football game . Billy Ray looks around at the traders in the pit , whose eyes are all glued on the CLOCK . As it STRIKES NINE , a LOUD BUZZER SOUNDS , and all hell breaks loose . . . A collective convulsaion of buying and selling sweeps the pit . The traders seem to have gone berserk  --  jumping up and down , waving fistfuls of orders , screaming at the top of their lungs , wildly signalling with their hands in the special sign language of the Board of Trade . Arms flailing , they spin from one side of the pit to the other , bumping , pushing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy-and-sell orders into one another 's faces , so close that they 're breathing the same air . The NOISE is a DEAFENING ROAR . It 's like being in the middle of a buffalo stampede . BILLY RAY is pushed to the floor , stepped on , kicked . When he gets up , somebody uses his back to write an order . Then he 's knocked down again .  --  147  --  On all fours , he manages to crawl out of the pit , panting and shell-shocked . He spots Whipple and fights his way through a throng of screaming purple-faced traders to get to him . WHIPPLE in contrast to everyone else in the pit , appears totally serene . He 's not trading ; he 's just standing there , the calm at the center of the storm , smiling approvingly at the commotion raging around him . &nbsp; BILLY RAY ( shouting above the DIN ) What are we doing ? &nbsp; LOUISWe 're waiting . &nbsp; BILLY RAYFor what ? &nbsp; LOUISFor the price to go up .

I can feel it ! &nbsp; TRADER #3Let 's get in on it ! Traders #3 and #4 rush into the pit and start feverishly buying , following Wilson 's lead . Transactions are scribbled and tossed to the floor , where they 're snatched up by CLERKS , who then withstand shoulder blocks and clips as they sprint with the slips of paper over to  --  THE ROSTRUM The papers are handed to BOARD OFFICIALS , who enter them into computers .

He looks up at  --   --  149  --  THE BOARD as the price of " APRIL OJ " climbs to $1.42 , reflecting the buying frenzy in the pit . BACK TO WHIPPLE glancing from the board to the wall clock , which reveals that it 's only minutes before 10:00 A.M. &nbsp; LOUIS ( to Billy Ray ) NOW ! ! ! In the space of a split second , Whipple is transformed into a man possessed . He begins madly flailing his arms forward to signal that he 's selling . &nbsp; LOUIS ( continuing ) Selling 200 April OJ , 1.42 ! ! ! BILLY RAY watches Whipple closely and then starts copying what he 's doing with his hand signals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face-to-face with Billy Ray . They 're madly gesticulating at one another like a group of enraged deaf-mutes . OTHER TRADERS swarm around Whipple and Valentine , anxious to buy from them . They seem to be the only ones in the pit going against the tide , betting that the price of OJ is going to fall . THE BOARD as the price of April OJ falls to a $1.40 . RANDOLPH AND MORTIMER notice the sudden drop in price , which continues as they watch . &nbsp; MORTIMERThat 's not right .  --  150  --  How can the price be going down ? &nbsp; RANDOLPHSomething 's wrong . Where 's Wilson ? They gaze down at the pit and for the first time see  --  WHIPPLE AND VALENTINE who , surrounded and growing hoarse , are selling as much OJ as they can . RANDOLPH AND MORTIMER look at one another in disbelief . &nbsp; MORTIMERWhat are they doing here ? &nbsp; RANDOLPHThey 're selling , Mortimer . &nbsp; MORTIMERThat 's ridiculous . . . unless that crop report . . . They look at each other in dawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their feet and run up the steps of the visitor 's gallery towards the exit . THE FLOOR as the Dukes desperately fight their way through a mass of traders and runners . It 's the first time we 've ever seen the Dukes ruffled , without their Olympian composure . &nbsp; MORTIMERI told you we should n't have committed everything , you asshole !  --  151  --  &nbsp; RANDOLPHIt 's not too late ! We 've got to find Wilson and tell him to sell ! They push their way towards the OJ pit . Suspended above the pit are four TV screens , which are . . .  --  152  --  . . . flashing Wall Street stock quotations , business news , world news updates . Suddenly , the screen goes blank and all action in the pit stops abruptly , as everyone cranes his neck up at  --  CLOSE - TV SCREEN A live closed-circuit broadcast from the Department of Agriculture in Washington , D.C.

After calculating the estimates from the various orange-producing states , we have concluded the following : The cold winter has apparently not affected the orange harvest .

RANDOLPH AND MORTIMER ca n't believe what they 're hearing . As it dawns on them , they claw their way towards  --   --  153  --  THE OJ PIT which has erupted into pandemonium , as Wilson and all the other traders who followed the Dukes are now desperately trying to sell . THE BOARD as the price of " APRIL OJ " starts to plummet . . . from $1.30 to $1.20. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $0.85 . . . BILLY RAY AND WHIPPLE are now feverishly buying OJ . There 's a desperate stampede of traders trying to get to them before they and their clients are completely ruined . They 're stabbing one another with pencils and clawing at each others ' eyes in their surge to reach Billy Ray and Whipple . WILSON is beside himself , in tears . His face suddenly turns blue . He starts to have a heart attack but valiantly keeps on trading . He sinks to the floor , but nobody takes any notice ; they just climb right over him . PARAMEDICS rush over , clamp an oxygen mask on his face , and carry him off while the mad trading goes on without missing a beat . RANDOLPH AND MORTIMER arrive at the pit just as Wilson is being carried off . &nbsp; RANDOLPHWilson ! Where are you going ? &nbsp; MORTIMERYou idiot ! Come back here at once ! The Dukes snatch the sell orders clutched in Wilson 's fist , and charge into the pit , looking for buyers . They 're pushed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the panicked traders . Just as they finally manage to fight their way through the pack , the BUZZER SOUNDS signalling the end of the trading day . BILLY RAY AND WHIPPLE hear the BUZZER SOUND . . .  --  154  --  . . . and suddenly all trading in the pit abruptly stops . They look at one another , sweat pouring off their faces , and then up at  --  THE BOARD where April Orange Juice has closed out at $0.29 a pound .
