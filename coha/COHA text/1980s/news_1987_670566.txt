In this , the third and final play of the Delacorte ' s 25th anniversary season , " Henry IV , Part I " is given a curiously enervated production , an approach that is especially disconcerting in a work that should surge with youthful vitality , both in the tavern and on the battlefield. // The performances - with the definite exception of Mr. Moffat - are , for the most part , as perfunctory as the concept . The setting for the entire evening is the Boar ' s Head Tavern , which , as we are told in a program note , was licensed as a theater . With the introductory announcement by an actor that we are watching " the acting company " of that tavern , the scene is set for a play within a play . But one should expect no Olivier-like transformation ( in his film of " Henry V , " we were swept away from a stage setting to the field at Agincourt ) . // Except for the fact that some of the speeches are addressed directly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peripheral . The final scene once again acknowledges the tavern as a setting , as , Trevor Nunn style , the actors sit around and watch the principals perform. // David Mitchell ' s scenery is unadorned ; atmosphere is supposed to be enhanced by the performances . Unfortunately , this is not the case , particularly in the instance of Conan McCarty ' s tepid Hotspur , whose words frequently contradict his self-description . " I am on fire , " he says , as we watch the performance fizzle . When King Henry IV says that he wishes his son , Hal , were the measure of the volatile Hotspur , one wonders if the monarch did not have his eye on a different production - perhaps the one presented several seasons ago at the Royal Shakespeare Company , in which Timothy Dalton , pre-James Bond , was a striking Hotspur. // At least Tony Soper ' s Hal has an acceptable look if not exactly a princely demeanor . Mr. Soper , who , along with Mr. McCarty , is new to the New York Shakespeare Festival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of his scenes , such as his play-acting with Falstaff , have a certain resilience . However , at other crucial points he lacks conviction , as when he promises his father that he will live up to his birthright . Once again , with insufficient proof , the King ( Michael Zaslow ) is too easily convinced . The scene is additionally undercut by the fact that Mr. Soper plays it with his back to the audience . Later , when Hal concludes that Falstaff has died in battle , the actor acknowledges the prostrate form of his friend with the barest of emotion. // In a sturdier production , such as the one presented in Central Park six years ago ( in which John Vickery and Kenneth McMillan were a balanced team as Hal and Falstaff ) there are also vivid performances in the small but choice roles . This is not the case in the current version . Hotspur ' s allies tend to merge into a faceless band , so much so that , for a moment , we do not miss the rebellious Glendower , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , Lady Mortimer ( perhaps the two are still in Wales ) . Among the supporting players , Tony Shalhoub has a modicum of success doubling as Poins and Vernon and Edward Zang has the oiliness of the Archbishop. // When Mr. Moffat is on stage , the evening regains confidence . At times , perhaps echoing the director ' s approach , his Falstaff seems himself like a character actor - a man of many parts . He is a self-dramatizer , easily able to switch from barroom roisterer to battlefield campaigner ( and coward ) , while always retaining a comic sense of equilibrium and an affectionate regard for Hal , who will , of course , in the subsequent play , abandon him . Mr. Moffat ' s achievement is even more sizable when one considers the limits of the other actors in his orbit. // Despite the cuts in the text , the evening is slow-paced , even during the sword-to-sword contest between Hal and Hotspur . As staged by Malcolm Ranson , their duel provokes no feeling of urgency , no sense that life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On a rainless summer ' s night , such as was the case at Wednesday ' s preview , the Delacorte is a most conducive setting for Shakespeare .
