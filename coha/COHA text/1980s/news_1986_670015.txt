Espionage these days is a victim of overexposure . It is becoming banal , almost a yawn . Who are these impostors , anyway  --  the Walker family ( extended ) , or such suspects as Jonathan Jay Pollard the flake or Larry Wu-Tai Chin the inscrutable ? And what was the game of Vitaly Yurchenko , sometime Soviet defector ? The motivations of these people range from murky to tawdry , their operating styles from inept to inexplicable . Spies are giving spying a bad name . All the more welcome , then , is Craig Thomas ' s latest novel , " Lion ' s Run " ( Bantam , 502 pages , $17. 95 ) , a bracing thriller that restores a measure of class to the image of espionage . Mr. Thomas is a Welshman who has been producing an impressive shelf of spy novels , including " Firefox " and " Firefox Down ! " His latest work maintains the pace : The plot offers enough complications to keep the mind alert but not befuddled ; good guys and bad guys are well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The identity of the principal villain fairly leaps off the page about a third of the way through ) ; there is the obligatory bit of hi-tech hocus-pocus , involving in this case the main computer at Moscow Centre , and the main good guy makes the requisite number of hairbreadth escapes . Gore is spilled , but with restraint . And the denouement , while satisfying , stops mercifully short of a sudden sunrise bursting through the impenetrable gloom . As the tale begins , Sir Kenneth Aubrey , newly appointed chief of the British Secret Intelligence Service , is on the brink of " turning " his Soviet counterpart , KGB Deputy Chairman Kasputin . But Aubrey ' s plans go suddenly and terribly wrong , as he becomes the victim of a masterful frame-up . Instead of turning Kasputin , Aubrey himself is made to appear the " double . " His apparent treachery is all neatly documented on film , and in a Soviet file that comes into the hands of his colleagues . In short order , he is denounced by his countrymen as a traitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket for nearly 40 years . At the same time , our hero is fingered for the never precisely explained death back in 1946 of a senior British colleague , following Sir Kenneth ' s escape ( real ? engineered ? ) from Soviet agents in the Russian sector of Germany . The only hard proof of the truth within this miasma of double-dealing and disinformation  --  code name " Teardrop "  --  is buried in the KGB ' s central computer in Moscow and in the brain of a now discredited KGB master spy , effectively exiled to a command in Afghanistan . The trap sprung on Sir Kenneth is nearly flawless . His only hope of rescue lies with a valiant but motley band of truth seekers , hemmed in at every turn by an unholy alliance of the British Establishment , the KGB and their ham-handed American cousins in Langley , Va . The cavalry consists of Sir Kenneth ' s Australian aide and bodyguard , a retired CIA agent now married to the daughter of that mysteriously deceased former colleague , a mid-level British intelligence operative who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assorted stock types from the espionage demimonde of several continents . The trail they follow runs from London to Vienna and Bonn , to Afghanistan and Czechoslovakia . Ultimately it leads to the innards of the computer in Moscow , and to an outcome in which Truth , Virtue , Valor and Fidelity to Duty emerge appropriately right side up . Believable ? Not really . The heroes are too heroic , the villains too villainous . There is that one critical telephone left conveniently untapped , and that one safe haven that somehow remains outside the net of surveillance . And , however masterful the frame-up , it boggles credence that no one in the top levels of British government or intelligence ever seems to wonder why the Soviets are so ostentatiously cooperative in helping the fake scenario to unfold . But not to quibble . The derring-do gives off sparks . The suspense is galvanizing , the plot holds together in the pinch , the sense of specific locale is almost tangible . As Aubrey ' s Australian aide carries out his quixotic , apparently hopeless rescue mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile after gut-busting mile through the Afghan hills . We dodge KGB hit men in Vienna ' s Belvedere gardens , and hang by a fingernail from the ironwork of a rat-infested warehouse . We are , viscerally , on location . Anyway  --  and this of course is why spy-thriller addicts never are satiated  --  it ' s all believable because we want to believe . Among other things , we want to believe in the inherent rationality of the universe , and the probable triumph of virtue . We dare to hold out hope for the fundamental rightness of the ambivalent and messy process of secret intelligence , when it ' s pressed into service on our side . There is no trace in these pages of " moral equivalency , " of good shading into and becoming indistinguishable from evil . Between the two worlds of espionage , Craig Thomas ' s fiction and Vitaly Yurchenko ' s reality , fiction wins going away.  --  - Mr. Lichenstein is a senior fellow of the Heritage Foundation in Washington.           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
