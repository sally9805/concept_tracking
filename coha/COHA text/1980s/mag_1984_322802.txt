In this era of world leadership , the metal detector is the altar and the minicam may be god . <P> In just 20 years , terrorism , communications , the jet plane and the increase of wealth and knowledge have forced , to varying degrees , world leaders into a haunted and secret peerage whose links with the people they guide are meticulously cleansed and staged . All of them lament this fact , from the Pope to the Prince of Wales , and none more than Ronald Reagan on his Old World pilgrimage , but they know their new age of isolation is nevertheless a stark fact of life . <P> The old order may have reached its zenith with John Kennedy 's trip to Ireland in 1963 . We just did not understand what was happening then . Kennedy rode through multitudes in an open car . He stood on the quay at New Ross from where his great-grandfather sailed for Boston , hugging and laughing with anybody who came , even shabby , unshaven figures who emerged unsteadily from the pubs to hail the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Reagan 's ancestral Ballyporeen was thoroughly infiltrated by security agents , both men and women dressed as camera-toting tourists . In the Ronald Reagan Lounge , John O'Farrell , an entrepreneurial genius , proprietor of O'Farrell 's Pub , posed with his family as cast . They were positioned and tutored for pictures , including four-week-old Catherine Nancy O'Farrell , named for Mrs. Reagan . It was duly reported that a man in a cloth cap was ushered in as " a solitary rep-representative of the plain people of Ballyporeen . " <P> Kennedy 's motorcade inched into Dublin with thousands of swirling fans around him , the young President 's profile etched in the afternoon sun . Reagan helicoptered from a secluded airport corner to his house in Phoenix Park ; the streets of Dublin were nearly deserted . <P> But just as stagy as the Reagan spectacle were the protests that helped to produce the President 's protective script . The " ring around Reagan " of at least 5,000 marching Dubliners condemning Reagan 's foreign policy played to television cameras . The Catholic prelates who snubbed Reagan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists who descended on Ballyporeen outnumbered the village 's entire population more than 5 to 1 . <P> And yet during all of this plotted pageantry through Ireland and the commemoration of D-day in Normandy came images of true affection , understanding and meaning . Beamed to an estimated 300 million people around the world , that may be a fair trade-off for the lost intimacy . <P> The future may bring even more changes for ceremonial visits and leadership councils like the London economic summit . Many events are already covered through " pool " arrangements , in which a small group of reporters is selected to represent and report back to the rest of the press corps . There may have to be more of that , because hard-pressed countries and communities can scarcely afford the millions of dollars and man-hours necessary to protect a leader as well as cope with a huge entourage .
