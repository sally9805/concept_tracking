In potentially the most important move , the party is reportedly ready to commit itself to rewriting the nation ' s Constitution before President Chun Doo Hwan leaves office in February. // Officials said this would in effect nullify Government plans to use the existing Constitution to transfer power from Mr. Chun to his hand-picked successor , Roh Tae Woo , the party chairman . According to some reports , Mr. Roh , an ally of Mr. Chun since their army days together , may also renounce his nomination as the party ' s presidential candidate. // // Announcement Expected Soon // " His candidacy should not be an obstacle for dialogue between the ruling and opposition parties , " a National Assemblyman and senior member of the ruling party , Lee Chi Ho , said in a television broadcast Friday night. // Specific concessions are supposed to be announced in the next few days . They would come after earlier conciliatory gestures by Mr. Chun , including his offer to release several hundred jailed protesters and his meeting Wednesday with Kim Young Sam , a key opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of concern in Washington . The Senate unanimously approved a resolution warning Seoul that failure to agree on timely , democratic changes essential to free elections was endangering the peaceful transfer of power it has promised for next year . Page 14 . The question of constitutional change touched off the present crisis , and leading members of the governing Democratic Justice Party said they had to deal with the issue firmly if they were to halt street disturbances that could lead to military intervention . <> <> Effort to Prove Sincerity // " The most important consideration is how we can persuade people of our sincerity , " said Hyun Hong Choo , a National Assemblyman who often serves as an unofficial party spokesman . " Any plan should be very bold , very candid , and should give people an impression that the D.J.P. means business this time. " // But the ruling camp ' s promised proposals remained ambiguous , and the only person whose views really count , Mr. Chun , has said nothing publicly about them. // To the contrary , comments that he made last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was satisfied with the present Constitution . That was consistent with views he had expressed for several years. // There was also no guarantee that the ruling party ' s plans would not change , as they have before in a crisis that has taken many sudden turns since it began June 10 . Last Monday , Mr. Roh was supposed to have announced another package of concessions , but it was suddenly delayed by two or three days for more discussions . When three days passed , they were delayed again. // In addition , politicians and neutral analysts said it was highly possible that even if the ruling camp agreed to rewrite the Constitution , it would then simply seek to transfer power from Mr. Chun to Mr. Roh through a new process of some sort. // Nevertheless , if the effort is an earnest one , it would deal directly with a dominant opposition demand . That did not guarantee success , though . The fundamental lack of mutual trust would make any agreement hard to reach. // " It is not clear they are completely sincere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s best-known dissident politician . <> <> ' Refloating Old Ideas ' // Skepticism was also expressed by foreign diplomats . " They ' re just refloating old ideas and testing them out again now , " a Western diplomat said. // After another night of severe street clashes between tens of thousands of anti-Government demonstrators and riot policemen , Seoul was relatively calm today . Tensions remained high , however , and skirmishes involving several hundred college students flared near the centuries-old East Gate and in front of the Seoul Hilton Hotel , a few miles away. // For the first time in more than two weeks , hope was expressed by both Government and opposition leaders that the worst of the civil unrest may be over for now as South Korea enters its rainy season and a summer recess begins on university campuses . It was too early for hard predictions , however . Several times , disorders have subsided only to reignite. // Anti-Government protests have been building since April 13 , when Mr. Chun suspended public debate on how to change the Constitution ' s provisions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // The President is now selected by a 5 , 000-member electoral college , a system that the opposition charges is skewed to guarantee victory by the ruling party . The opposition pressed for direct elections , both because it considers them more democratic and because they are probably its best hope to gain power. // After discussions went nowhere for a year , Mr. Chun canceled further debate and said he would use the present Constitution to tranfer presidential authority . But as unrest grew , spreading to cities across the country , he retreated and called for debate to resume . He said nothing specific , however , about timing , giving an impression that he still meant to turn over power to Mr. Roh. // In the last few days , politicians from the ruling party have begun to reinterpret the President ' s announcement . By reversing himself on the April 13 decision , they said , all of the original plans for Mr. Roh ' s ascension were undone. // " We ' re going to have the next election under a new constitution , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " An important share of the party shares this view.

He would remain the party ' s nominee under any new system that may be devised , the Assemblyman said. // What the ruling camp will propose specifically is not clear . One possibility , prominently mentioned in today ' s newspapers , would be to dissolve the National Assembly and to hold elections this year , with each party setting forth their ideas for a new constitution . Essentially , the party getting the most Assembly seats would win the constitutional debate. // Nothing seems settled except that behind all the maneuvering lies a Government eagerness to lure the opposition Reunification Democratic Party into negotiations .

Mr. Kim does not want to meet with Mr. Roh because he fears that would lend legitimacy to a Roh candidacy .
