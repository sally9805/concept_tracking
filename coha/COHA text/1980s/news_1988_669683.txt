Such trading has not been tightly controlled by Japanese government regulators and prosecutors , as it is in the United States. // Just last week in the US , for example , Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. and the head of its high-yield bond department were charged with misusing inside information. // Insider trading without guilt // But in Japan , where the word ' ' fairness ' ' only recently appeared in the stock market ' s rule book , insider trading has been widely practiced with little or no guilt. // Naoko Kamimura is one of many who were led to the stock market through insider trading . The 24-year-old airline stewardess never dreamed of making money in stocks until recently , when a salesman from a local brokerage called her . He recommended an Osaka-based machinery company stock , she says , because he had inside information guaranteeing the share price would rise. // // ' ' I did not understand the meaning of the information , but it sounded reasonable , ' ' says Ms. Kamimura . So she took money that she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 000 shares of the company for 68 , 000 yen ( $451 ) . To her delight , the share price soared by nearly 40 percent in less than a month. // Like Kamimura , many investors in Japan say they would have no idea of what to buy if they had no inside information to make a decision . And many brokers say that , for competitive reasons , they can not make recommendations to customers without inside information. // But foreign investors , whose presence in Japan is rapidly increasing , complain that the market is unfair to outsiders who can ' t play the game according to the peculiar Japanese rules. // Scandals lead to crackdown // To accommodate the huge Japanese stock market to Western standards of fair play , Japanese authorities are starting a crackdown on inside trading. // ' ' Five years ago , ' ' says Michio Katsumata , a spokesman for Nomura Securities , ' ' it was unthinkable that the Finance Ministry would change its securities law only to prevent the well-accepted practice of insider trading . But today , we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretary as part of insider trading story . Definitely something is changing here. ' ' // Analysts , economists , and some investors say the revelation of a series of stock-related scandals in recent months and the hasty implementation of more-stringent legislation reflect a new direction. // Still , defenders of the current system , especially veteran investors and securities company officials , argue that traditions in the Japanese stock market are deeply rooted . Simply tightening rules and revealing violations , they say , won ' t bring a genuine change. // Concern about insider trading hardly existed in Japan until last September , when Osaka-based Hanshin Sogo Bank sold off a large holding of Tateho Chemical Company shares , shortly before the latter announced a huge loss in bond-futures trading. // Securities regulators in Osaka later disclosed that Tateho had notified the bank , which was its creditor , about the loss prior to the public announcement . Despite a public outcry and news-media criticism , neither party faced criminal charges , because the action did not violate existing securities legislation. // So in February a revised securities law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On a visit to Tokyo earlier this year , David Ruder , chairman of the US Securities and Exchange Commission , said that the new Japanese law ' ' covers 98 percent of what we cover in the United States. ' ' // The new law was intended to satisfy public demands for tougher control on unfair trading and to show foreign governments , especially the US , that the Finance Ministry is determined to lift its ethical standards. // In June , the country was shaken by a major scandal involving aides to top politicians - including associates of Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa . The government officials allegedly made a huge profit , ranging from 25 million yen to 100 million yen ( $188 , 000 to $752 , 000 ) , through dubious trading of unlisted stocks. // The scandal was dubbed ' ' Recruit-gate ' ' after Recruit Cosmos Co. , a Tokyo real estate concern . Dramatically undervalued shares of Recruit Cosmos were handed to politicians . They allegedly made large profits by selling after public trading of the shares began. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sankyo Seiki Manufacturing , a precision machinery company , skyrocketed a few days before the public learned that Nippon Steel Company , the world ' s largest steelmaker , was acquiring a large stake in Sankyo. // Unusually thorough investigation by the Finance Ministry and the Tokyo Stock Exchange revealed as many as 100 employees of both companies had knowledge of the acquisition and bought a large number of Sankyo shares as early as a week before the public announcement of the deal. // This spate of scandals prompted the Finance Ministry to speed up its timetable . The ministry advanced by more than two months the implementation of part of the Revised Securities and Exchange Law , which passed the Diet in May . A provision enlarging the investigatory function of the Finance Ministry , for instance , took effect late last month rather than on the original October deadline. // Brokerages have begun to take action , too . Giant Nomura Securities , for instance , announced it will build a ' ' Chinese wall ' ' to block the flow of information between its corporate financing and retail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibit its executives from trading stocks. // Securities , banking , and insurance associations have all introduced guidelines to prevent inside trading . The Tokyo Stock Exchange has asked its member companies to streamline the disclosure process and asked for the prompt release of corporate information that may affect share prices. // Keisuke Matsuura , a private investment consultant who has followed the Japanese market more than 30 years , says ' ' Recruit-gate , ' ' with its links to top political aides , was itself a sign of change. // ' ' Behind-the-door dealings like these were routinely practiced , ' ' Mr. Matsuura says . ' ' But it was unthinkable five years ago that such a case would be revealed with real names. ' ' // Still , many market participants believe traditions and customs won ' t change simply by setting up new rules. // Tradition dies hard // ' ' The mentality of the investors and stock brokers has to be changed drastically if insider trading is to be stopped , ' ' says Matsuura. // Hiroshi Itakura , a professor at Nihon University and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and various measures by companies themselves are almost meaningless unless they are intended to establish the concept of insider trading as a wrong activity. // ' ' The majority of people are unconsciously indulging themselves in insider trading without knowing what it is , ' ' he says . ' ' Many investors do not know any other form of investment than insider trading. ' ' // Many analysts point out that even the new measures have too many loopholes . For example , they say , Nikko Securities ' new rule prohibiting executives from dealing with stocks does not take their family members into account. // ' ' In Japan , no salesmen buy stocks under their own name , ' ' says Keiichi Nishida , an analyst at Kidder , Peabody ' s Tokyo office. // Interviews with brokers and officials at securities firms , who spoke only on condition of anonymity , show how hard it will be to change the tradition of insider trading. // One senior official of a major securities firm , for instance , says the Japanese market is already fair. // ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Japanese stock market is formed in a way which is best suited for the Japanese people , ' ' he notes . ' ' So if foreign investors want to win in Japan , they have to learn the Japanese way - as we had to learn their way when we entered their market - instead of demanding we change our custom. ' ' // Another senior official at a major securities firm claims insider trading in the Western sense is not necessarily insider trading in Japan. // ' ' If everyone who participates in market activities is more less a beneficiary of insider information , do you call it unfair ? ' ' he asks . ' ' If so , I ' d like to know who are outsiders . Outsiders in the Japanese stock market are those who have nothing to do with the stock market. ' ' // //
